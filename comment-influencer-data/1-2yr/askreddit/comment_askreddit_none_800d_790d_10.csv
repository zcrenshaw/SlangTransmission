"Bad seperation, wife filed a restraining order on the husband (very common, wasn't a terrible guy but not great either). A year into the divorce his mother was dying, he asked his sister to speak with his ex-wife and ask to bring the kids to see her in the hospital before she died. The wife never did, instead she went to the court and said he violated the restraining order by trying to contact her (you can't contact someone through another party). 

He admitted it and explained the situation, but was found in breach of the order. His mother died while he was locked up and the wife never brought the kids to see her."

"When I did safety patrol in elementary school we gave out ""good job"" tickets to younger kids if they made good choices in the hallway. My best friend from my neighborhood was a grade below me so every day I would give him a good job card so his mom would let him come outside and play.

"Oh yes... finally a place to share this story.

I started driving for Uber about a year ago, and nothing too crazy happened. Except for one time...

I picked up two guys one Saturday evening, and they said that they were headed to a bar to hang out. I didn't think much of it until they got into the car. Something smelled horrible. I couldn't pinpoint what the smell was though. It almost smelled like spoiled meat or fish.

We didn't talk much through the ride, other the the usual get-to-know-you conversation. They were pretty short with their answers, so I just let it go and kept the silence.

It got to the point where the smell coming from them was so unbearable that I had to crack a few windows just to air out. As we were nearing their destination, one of the guys said, ""You can just drop us off here."" It was a few blocks from where they said their destination was.

They opened the doors and as they were stepping out of the car, they ran. I was really confused. Within a few seconds, I couldn't see them anymore. I looked at the back seats to my car only to find bloodstains on the seat. I thought it looked really suspicious, so I called the police. They looked at my car and asked me more details. The police told me that there was a woman who was killed earlier today, and the suspects were 2 middle aged men. I described them and they matched the descriptions perfectly.

The police called for backup and started searching the whole area, and it turns out that the guys were caught a few hours later.

Tl;dr: Two people killed a woman and used me as a getaway vehicle."

"More mysterious than creepy. We were camping in Montana near Yellowstone park in a small campground. It was the off season and there were maybe 5 other people there, including a couple 3-4 spots down who had a large dog with them in their RV. I walked by and the dog was friendly so I petted it and talked to it and went on my way.

Later that night I am sitting watching the sun set and reading on my Kindle when a cold nose bumps up under my arm, like dog does when it wants attention. I figured it was the dog and started scratching its head. Before i could look around, my friend came around the corner and froze with a look of fright on his face. I was scratching the head of a pretty big grey wolf. I had no idea what to do, I didnt want to keep touching it but I didnt want to stop and piss it off either. I scratched for maybe 5-10 more seconds and it just looked at me like ""Thanks, bro"" and walked off into the woods. We went to a hotel that night..."

"In Elementary School I had this one teacher who when she would have to leave the classroom, she'd pick a random kid to stand at the chalkboard and watch the class. No one was allowed to talk or get up until the teacher came back. To be honest, my class was pretty rowdy, and given the chance we could get really loud. Which is why the teacher didn't want us talking if she was gone. If you talked or got up, your name went on the board and you'd lose five minutes of recess. Then tally marks would be added if you talked or got up again, and you'd lose an additional five minutes, and if you got enough you'd start losing time on the next day's recess.

One day she picked this one kid, we'll call him Cole. Cole gets up there and he's slowly looking back and forth between each of us, and if he thought someone was going to talk, he'd put their name on the board. They didn't have to do anything, and he'd put their name on the board and cost them five minutes of recess. He then offered those with their names on the board that he'd take their name off before the teacher got back if they held their breath until he said they could breathe.

I spent a solid 3 hours figuring out how to get this out of my car.  I've never seen an owl in person, and never dealt with one so I didn't know if they carry disease or attack or something.  About 7 people stopped asking if I needed help, when I told them an Owl flew in my car most of them drove off probably thinking I was running a scam or something.  My brother ended up coming by with a shoebox and we got it out and it took off.  I was afraid he was injured because he flew into my car from the drivers side, hit the passenger window which was closed, and then flew into the back. He seemed okay though. "

"Story from my parents who are lawyers. So throughout the divorce proceedings, there was a car that was a huge point of contention between the husband and wife. After months and months of saying he would never let the wife have the car, the husband concedes in exchange for something great, like one of their summer houses. It turns out he had been driving the car for 3 hours everyday in a big loop around the city, putting thousands and thousands of miles on it basically making it worthless. The amount of planning and spite that went into that was amazing."
"I saw a car crash as a child. My dad stopped the car to go help. He made me stay in the car but i saw one body on the ground that started to gain a puddle of blood around it, and another body handing out a window of one of the cars involved in the accident. Blood, glass, and car chunks were everywhere. Horns were honking, heard a lot of screaming. My dad came walking back to the car shortly after he got out. I asked what happened, he said there was nothing he could do, pulled into a parking lot, and waited for cops to come. I remember being impressed by how fast the firefighters cleaned everything up. You would think seeing the bodies would stick with me, but what stuck with me was the pale dead look on my dad when he came back to me. Sometimes your best intentions cant do anything, and i could tell it got to him. "

You don't know how to code but we can teach you. But he didn't want to. He wanted to delegate and then sit on his ass. So the 3 of us coded this flight management program while he organised meetings and set deadlines for us. He raged when we didn't finish said task within the time limit and went off on ridiculous rants. The kicker was that we had to include our names (as comments) on which part of the code we did and got graded on that. We continuously bugged him to learn just a bit, to at least create the front interface or the help section. But he straight out refused. Since he didn't write a single piece of code, he ended up getting a zero in the project. He started blaming us for not putting his name on the code and went and complained to the professor. The professor laughed in his face after he heard our story. This was a CS class. "

Dads lawyer was incompetent and sends an agreement that states he will pay $2,000 a month in child support until all kids are 18. Mom tried to explain to dad that it needed to be revised to lower every time a child turned 18. Dad called mom a cunt during that negotiation so mom said fuck it and signed the agreement and dad paid the $2,000/month for 10 years when he should've been paying around $1,400/month for 5 years and $700/month for the last 5 years.

"Not a lawyer, but [one of the top posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/3rqgu4/75_of_my_pay_oki_will_get_a_new_job/) from /r/ProRevenge is related (credit to /u/DrDiarrhea)

&gt; Not me, but a guy I worked with 10 years ago. I guess it counts as a revenge.
&gt; I worked with a guy who really stuck it to his ex wife. When I met him he was working in a sporting goods store making 8 dollars an hour. He was not really like the other retail monkeys. He was older, well groomed, well spoken, clearly educated etc. One night after work he gets into his car, and I couldn't help but notice that it was a very very nice newish Jaguar. I asked him how he could afford it and he explained it to me:
&gt; He had been an SVP at a well known fortune 50 company (which I will NOT mention the name of!), pulling in 300k with bonuses and stock options. He was married but the marriage fell apart and in the divorce, she demanded that she get the house and 40% of his wages. He and his lawyer somehow managed to get her to agree to let him keep the house in exchange for 75% of his pay..no dollar figure or employer specified lol. As soon as she took the settlement he quit his job and looked for a minimum wage job. He said to me that ""She gets 75% of nearly nothing now"". He had other money stashed away, so he didn't even need the job and he had the house and it's equity as well. Also, no kids, so there was no child support. Just alimony.
&gt; She was furious of course, and tried to re-sue him but failed at least once and when she claimed that the settlement was not keeping her in the life style she was accustomed to, he simply told the judge that the divorce was traumatic to him and he could no longer do his old job as a result. At least at that time, she did not manage to get out of the deal. Not sure how it all ended. But I thought it was fucking brilliant if not crazy-level spiteful.
&gt; He was a good employee too...good with customers, showed up on time, no bullshit absenteeism or anything like that. He claimed he loved each payday because it reminded him how little she was getting.

"I saw a 5 year old girl fall about 30 feet from a chairlift while skiing. When she landed I was about 15 feet away. She landed on her stomach. I called ski patrol immediately but the time it took them to get there felt like an eternity (it was probably not more than 5 minutes). I had no medical training other than very basic ""do not move the injured person,"" since her face was directly in the snow, I took my jacket off and I held her neck/head still and had a nearby person slide my jacket under her face. It was shortly after Christmas, so I tried to distract her by asking her what she got from Santa, and I sang her favorite Christmas song. I kept holding her neck still until ski patrol took over and sent her in the ambulance. Later, I found out that although she had some bad bruising, she walked out of the ER later that day. 

EDIT: The girl had awesome parents. Even though this was the holidays, they contacted a therapist right away and even got her out skiing just a couple of days later so she wouldn't always have a fear. About 5 years after this happened, I became a member of the National Ski Patrol which is a volunteer organization that usually patrols at smaller resorts. "

Not me but a friend who also drives in my city picked up this drunk girl on her batchelorette at 8pm on a Saturday night. She was going like four blocks but was so drunk she passed out the second she sat down.

He pulls off and about 30 seconds later she shits in her sleep. She's wearing very short shorts so it just falls out both sides.

Being that she's passed the fuck out, he drives her to her hotel anyway (with the windows down trying not to vomit).

When he gets there, she kinda wakes up, and in the process of getting out manages to smear shit on his back seat, on the back of the front seat, on the inside roof, on the outside roof, and on the door.

She says sorry, throws him $20, and disappears.

Uber gives him $250 to clean his car, charged to the shitter. They next day he gets an email from Uber saying she called them all pissed off because why did she have to pay a soilage charge when she already gave him $20 to get the car cleaned?

As we got closer to the hotel though we saw more and more people shouting and carrying flags. 

We made it to our room and proceeded to get down to business. But as things were getting hot and heavy we heard a crowd outside cheering. I dunno why I stopped, but my wife and I just kinda looked at each other like ""okay, wtf is going on?""  I walked over to the window and saw hundreds of people surrounding the ground zero site.

edit: Added a few more pictures. Popping this all took close to a month, and we destroyed several air poppers in the process. We went to the local thrift store and were just buying old ones there to go towards the cause.

edit 2: Here's some of the other pranks that led up to this.

It started with him sneaking a little bit of oil into my carburetor, and convincing me that my engine was about to go when it blew smoke everywhere (I had a 57 Ford at the time).

Later, he played it off like my other friend (The one I'm shaking hands with in the picture) had done it, so we pulled a joke on him. He forgot his backpack at my house after school one day, so we ran up to the local liquor store, and bought every copy of Playgirl that they had. Actually, we ~~drug~~ dragged along my sister's friend, and had her buy them for us, lol. So we spent several hours cutting out pictures of naked guys and gluing them to every single picture in all of his text books. We also got a pair of lacy bright red panties, and clipped them to the bottom ring of his binder, so when he pulled his binder out in class those would come out with them. We did some other things to the backpack as well, but I don't remember the specifics. 

Any ways, he got the backpack from me before class the next morning. As he was having breakfast before class, another friend who missed class the day before asked if he could copy his notes, so he found the panties, which caused him to examine his backpack further. He wound up skipping all of his classes that day, and scraping a bunch of naked guys out of his books. This was in college, not high school.

One of the other pranks was we decorated the 64 Falcon with fishing bait. Anchovies everywhere, under his door handles, in the tail pipe, under his windshield wipers. And a big mackerel that we'd caught put on his radio antenna like an antenna topper.

There were dozens of other jokes over the course of a few years, but those are the main ones that I remember."

"Not a lawyer, but when I was a kid my parents got divorced.  My mom met a guy on the internet and left my dad for him.  My sisters and I were all teenagers and being that my mom had never really been around decided that we all wanted to live with him.  We all had to write a letter stating our wishes and it was understood that we would stay with him - my mom didn't even seem to care.  

Additionally, my dad had this retirement account from his old job - he wasn't rich at all and had worked his ass off for everything he'd ever had.  When he got hurt on the job he could have sued, but was promised that in exchange for him not suing, they'd keep him around.  Instead they canned him and he left with about $100k (I think) in a 401-k type account that he'd been saving for nearly 30 years.

  Lastly, my dad had his house.  It was a 3 bedroom, 1 bath brick house that was all of about 800 SF.  It wasn't much at all, but my dad loved the place.  My mom couldn't stand that house and wanted to move for as long as I could remember - that was another contentious subject that led to the divorce.  He'd been paying on it forever and when he left his old job, he took out a small chunk and paid it off.  

Anyway, their separation is progressing and it's understood we're living with him.  She was so in love with this internet guy that she didn't care.  He was in school halfway around the country and she was going to move there to be with him; we knew we'd get by just fine.  They seemed amicable and it was understood how this would all play out.  

The day in court finally comes and instead of what we all assumed, even my dad's lawyer - she goes to the court with all these crazy claims.  He was an abusive alcoholic, he beat us and my mom nightly, he was crazy and no one would be safe in his care.  My mom got full custody, she got 50% of his house and 50% of his retirement account.  My dad was stunned - that judgement would basically bankrupt him - in order for him to keep the house, he'd essentially have to clean out his retirement account and give her everything.   

The night of their divorce I went over to see him.  He was almost catatonic - he just stared off in space the entire time and would mumble whenever I asked him a question.  I've never seen anyone like that ever.  My birthday was 2 days away and I asked if he wanted to do something for my birthday and he just answered with ""your mom has full custody.  I will if she allows me to see you.""  I asked if I could drive his old truck to school, since I didn't yet have a car and he just said no, that I needed to call my mom and have her pick me up.  So that's what I did. 

And the next day in school, the day before my birthday, I'm sitting in our lunchroom when I hear ""hey, isn't that your grandpa?"" From a buddy of mine.  I look over and see my grandpa and a cop making their way across the lunchroom toward me.  They told me to grab my stuff and in the office I found my sister there as well.  We rode home with them, where we were also met by my little sister and that's where they told us that our dad had killed himself, shortly after I left the previous night. 

To make matters worse, it all happened so quickly that nothing had been finalized.  My mom dropped all her paperwork and legally became a widow and got everything - house, retirement and his insurance policy.  She also got social security benefits for us, a fact we didn't find out until much later.  She basically took all the money and moved across the country with her new man, leaving us to care for ourselves for the most part.

 And to this day, when asked about raising us, she'll spin this story of a young widow, doing her best to raise three kids on her own.."
"I was in year 3 in primary school, and Father's Day rolled around.  As usual, the teacher had everyone in the class make a card.  Now my Dad died when I was one, and previous teachers had been sensitive to this and let me make a card for my Mums birthday which falls a few weeks later.  Not this one though.  

She was adamant that I had to make a Father's Day card, despite knowing the situation and despite me clearly being very upset.  She said that she wasn't going to make me a special case as it wouldn't be fair to everyone else, and that if I didn't have anyone to give the card to then I could give it to one of my friends so their Dad could have two cards.  I hope she enjoyed watching me make it.

---Edit---

Wow, ok wasn't expecting this to get as big a reaction, let alone gold!  Thank you!  Also thank you to all of those that left kind comments - I've long since grown comfortable with how things worked out for me but I'm appreciating all the internet hugs.

To answer some of the common questions:

1.  Yes, my Mum did complain afterwards.  Apologies were made and it never happened again.

2.  The fate of the card - none of my classmates really wanted it (can't blame them, weird situation plus my artistry skills are somewhere south of ""crap""!).  I believe it just ended up in the bin.

3.  Despite that it was clearly a messed up situation, I harbour no real malice to the teacher involved.  Honestly I think she just backed herself into a corner, and then couldn't get out.  As I said, apologies were made to my Mum after she expressed (enthusiastically I believe) her displeasure.  Everyone has bad days at the office, I guess this was hers."

In the fine print of the agreement, it states that if you miss even one payment in that first year, your APR will jump to 29.95%. Half of my calls were to these new customers who would then proceed to throw a fit, because they didn't ever get the bill, and I had to explain to them that it was their job to know when the bill was due, and sending one was just a courtesy extended by the company.

1.There was no radioactive material inside - the X-rays were generated electronically.

2.Unfortunately, it never worked 100% correctly, so after trying to fix it for a few years, I broke it down for lead scrap last fall because it was 800lbs of immobile mass in a crowded garage, and I could no longer keep it around. I decided not to sell it, because I was terrified of whomever buying it having the wrong uses in mind.

3.All said and done, this cost $200.00 max, including fuel and tolls. I can't recall the exact figure because it was a while back.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Edit 2:** Alot of people are asking what sites to use for surplus auctions, so here are a few: https://gsaauctions.gov/, http://www.govliquidation.com/, http://www.go-dove.com/en/, http://www.govplanet.com/, http://www.ironplanet.com/ There are many other auction services out there for various regions too. Most large cities have surplus auctions at regular intervals, as do most states. Sometimes certain regions only have in-person auctions, which can be a good time if you've never been to one. Best to consult Google for those."

"I live in the only house down a country road, everything else is pasture land and National Forest for several miles. 

About 3am, my three large dogs go absolutely nuts barking, which sends my husband and i flying out of bed to check on our livestock, assuming coyotes were in the yard. 

Before we could even get our shoes on, we hear muttering on our front porch. He grabs his rifle and whoever it is starts knocking on the door, with no real urgency but more like a casual visitor. I had my cellphone already dialing the cops, and my husband slid up to the peephole. A woman right around her late 20s-early 30s was standing outside, patiently waiting a few minutes and gently knocking on the door, not fidgeting or nervous, not being aggressive. 

My husband said, ""Ma'am, the cops are on the way. If you need help, they'll be here in just a few minutes and you're welcome to sit on the swing right there and wait on them, but if there's anyone with you, we are armed in here and will not hesitate to shoot if anyone tries getting into this house."" 

He said she kind of smiled, not creepy but like she was glad her knocking woke someone up.  ""That's okay, sir-i just wanted to let you know the thing in the woods is coming, and he'll be here soon. Good luck."" 

He said she turned around and walked down the driveway like she hadn't a care in the world. The cops looked all over the place and couldn't find her. It's a ten minute drive to our driveway from the main road, with no houses until you get into town, another 20 minutes away. Freaked me out for weeks. "

"A local lawn maintenance business takes advantage of unsuspecting customers in 3 ways:

1. On monthly bills, they double the state tax (instead of being, say, 6%, it'll actually be 12%, if you check the math).

2. Without discussing it with homeowners, they charge *double* for ""double-cuts"" when the grass is a little taller in areas than usual. So, if you had agreed to pay $50 per mowing, the monthly bill says $100 for each visit. They never ask - they just do it and charge double (in most cases, it's just a small ""patch"" of the yard that has taller grass, not the entire thing).

3. They're supposed to mow once per week. But without telling customers first, they start mowing every 5 days - which means they get to charge for more mowing visits per month than necessary."

Principal: Why are you here?

So, I go back to my class and sit down at my desk. Then the teacher sees me.

Teacher: I told you to go to the Principal's office.

Teacher: Did you tell him what you did?

Me: I don't know what I did. (I seriously didn't)

Teacher: You know what you did, go back to the office.

I go back to the office.

Principal: Why are you back?

Principal then calls the teacher on the house phone and she says she doesn't remember why she sent me to the office but she's sure I did something. Principal tell me to go back to class. I've never been able to figure out why I was sent to the office but I learned that if you don't know why something was done don't make up a reason, just tell the truth.

"I used to volunteer at a local library when I was in high school. every year they had a book sale to help raise money for events. $0.25 for paperbacks and $0.50 for hardbacks. I was also working retail at this time so I decided being cashier would be pretty appropriate.

It was going pretty well. I kept the line moving and was used to the small talk of being at a register. The head librarian was busy organizing and she had one of the mom volunteers keep an eye on things. Not too long after she starter 'supervising,' she came over to me and told me she didn't think it was a good idea for me to be on register.

I was pretty confused by this. No one had complained, there was hardly ever a wait, there was no reason for her to think I wasn't capable. I told her it was fine, that I was used to this with my part time job. She was still visibly uneasy and insisted I help with something else. It got to the point where she was practically demanding me to go somewhere else. Not wanting to cause a scene, I went to assist elsewhere.

I found out later she thought the math of calculating the totals was too hard for 'children' to be responsible for. Seriously? I was in AP Calc and she didn't think I could add $0.25 and $0.50 increments? The best part of it all was that my mom went to the book sale a few years after and the same lady was on register. She had a cheat sheet for adding up the book totals .....

I'm still bitter. 



Edit: For those wondering about the cheat sheet, it was a list of the $0.25 increments like this:

1. $0.25

2. $0.50

3. $0.75

4. $1.00

5. $1.25 etc."

Dad tries to argue she's drunk and all kinds of other false claims. 

Judge ordered drug testing, and mom was clean. Dad then goes on to spend thousands of dollars having a PI follow mom to ""prove"" she's unfit. It all backfired though. PI found she was getting psych help for her issues (which actually helped mom), and dad had to explain to the judge why he had thousands to pay a PI but was arguing to not have to pay child support.

The whole situation was screwed up and took way too long, but dad's case just crumbled beneath him. "
"I work as a rocket launch photographer and I place cameras at the launchpads at Cape Canaveral. When I tell people that, they usually don't believe me, so I show them my photos. Sometimes they still don't believe me :)

I captured this [closeup shot](http://i.imgur.com/vM5fugF.jpg) of the engine and solid rocket motors on the Delta IV Medium+ (5,4) rocket. 

Now for the sad part: The cameras are sound-triggered; the sound would kill anyone that close to the rockets. We setup cameras 12-24 hours before the launches and GTFO.

I also photographed a launch [from a helicopter.](http://i.imgur.com/SxYggvw.jpg)

I've got more launch/Florida-inspired photos on my [website](http://www.johnkrausphotos.com) and [Instagram, @johnkrausphotos](http://www.instagram.com/johnkrausphotos) if anyone's interested.

Feel free to ask anything about the launches/cameras/setup/process.

---

**Some frequently asked questions:**

How does the camera not get destroyed?

- Sometimes they do, but I'm lucky enough to have not had much gear destroyed. I've had one kit lens get pitted by exhaust and dirt at the launchpad, but those are cheap and easy to replace. For my closeup images, I use cheap entry-level Nikon DSLRs (that are still capable of taking great images).

- I have my camera on top of tripod. Each leg of the tripod gets staked down with tent stakes to prevent the rocket or wind from knocking it over. I wrap the camera in a plastic bag to protect it from rain and the rocket.

- [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Pnd8Y44.jpg) is an image I took of one of my camera setups.

What settings did you use for the closeup image and how did you figure those out? Do you use auto mode?

- 1/4000, f/13, ISO 100, 80mm on a crop sensor camera. Fully manual mode, no auto. I used some of my previous photos as reference and talked with some good friends who have been shooting similar images for awhile.

How far away are the cameras?

- Depends on the launch. The camera that took the closeup image I linked above was about 100 yards from the rocket.

How'd you get started doing this?

- I started photography about 2/2.5 years ago and shot launched from public locations for about a year. An accredited media outlet took me under their wing and I am credentialed through them, which grants me access to the launchpads at Cape Canaveral to setup cameras.

Why is this applicable to this post?

- Because I tell people what they do and they don't believe me, so I show them the images."

"Over here in the Netherlands most legal costs are paid for by the government if your income is below a certain treshold. In practice this means that if one of the spouses in a divorce has little to no income and the other one has a normal income, the one with the normal income will have to pay a lot of the process drags on. 

Concidering there are plenty of ways to drag it on I've seen cases approach rediculous amounts of billable hours. 
There is a catch to this however. Your lawyer is paid a set amount if he/she is paid by the government. However, should the money you recieve after a divorce or w/e exceed a certain number, you are expected to pay your own lawyer (which is the reason we still keep track of the hours in these cases). So this one woman who thought she was screwing over her ex husband by dragging the divorce over multiple years got a payout of ~€40k by the end of it. Unfortunately for her she had to surrender most of that straight back in lawyer costs. There was a certain sense of justice in there. 

Also proves time and again that when there is conflict the only true winners are usually the lawyers."

I decided to do a second round of the cul-de-sac and when I get a quarter of the way through two guys emerge from the park and one of them pulls out his pistol and asked, ""what the fuck you doing in my neighborhood."" I decide to act really calm and just let him know that I'm with uber and was unable to find a passenger and who I was looking for.

"Not exactly NSFW, but definitely my favorite story.

I picked up a couple in their thirties on St. Patrick's Day this year at 2 AM. They wanted to take about a 35 mile drive at 6.3x surge, so I was about to give the third highest paying fare I'd ever given, great way to end the night!

They had clearly been drinking like they were 20 something's since early in the day. The wife (in the front seat) was super apologetic for the first five minutes or so, completely embarrassed about their level of intoxication, while the husband (in the back) was trying to be my new best friend.  After five minutes or so though, the sandman paid them a visit, and they both passed out. I drove for the next 20 minutes in relative peace.

When we arrived in their driveway, the husband was sound asleep, and they had a half inch of wet snow in their driveway, so I took the wife inside first. While on the way in, she upended her purse in the snow, but I was more focused on getting her safely inside. Once we got in, I helped her to the bathroom, and then went to the garage to get a snow shovel. I cleared a 4' wide path from the garage to the car, so I could get the husband inside (he's a bigger guy, and I wanted to be safe) and finally got him awake. I gave him my shoulder and got him inside. He begged me ""please, just get me to the recliner, I can't make it to bed"" so that's where we headed. All the while the wife is throwing up with the force of a small waterfall in the bathroom.

I ran outside and grabbed the contents of her purse, which included her phone (absolutely soaked at this point) and came back inside. She begged me to rice her phone, so I started to dig through her cupboards for a bag and rice. While digging I came across their meds, and pulled some EDIT: Advil (absorbed by kidneys) for them. I riced her phone then gave them both Advil and water and told them to take more in the morning, they were gonna need it. Then I locked the door and showed myself out. In the end, I was dropping them off for well over half an hour, but the fare was awesome and the day was my second best day of driving, so it didn't really bug me.

The kicker? They left me a 5-star review the next day: ""Pretty OK guy."" 

Best ride ever.

Obligatory healthcare provider edit: I promise I actually gave them Advil, I was typing that while very exhausted and hurriedly eating breakfast, and mixed up my drugs. I try not to poison my riders. :-)
When combining Advil with ETOH, don't take more than the recommended dose and combine with a fair amount of water to avoid GI issues up to and including bleeds.

"Hiding the fact that they have real hobbies and passions.

I don't know what it is, but back when I was dating, it always stunned me how so many girls would try to come across very vanilla on the first few dates. ""What do you like to do?"" ""Oh, you know, hang out with friends, Netflix, normal stuff."" Turns out she was a violinist in our city's symphony orchestra and had an extensive collection of bonsai trees (...which is probably specific enough to out this account if she finds this comment, but hey). I only found out she played violin when she couldn't come to a performance of my own for a (much less impressive) hobby that I talked about on our first date. And she *warned* me about the bonsai trees before the first time I went to her apartment, like I was going to think they were weird.

She was by no means the exception. Every girl I dated that came across very vanilla early on had something incredibly unique and positive about them, the exact kinds of things they *should* be talking about on a first date.

Somehow it seems society conditions many women to believe anything unique about them is weird, and their goal should be to appear as vanilla as possible for as long as possible so that the guy's in love with them before they discover how weird they are. Having hobbies and being passionate about something isn't weird, though.

Don't get me wrong, I also dated my fair share of women who wore their strangeness on their sleeve and thought *that* made them cute, when in reality it was usually attaching *too* much of their identity to a quirk or hobby, and that isn't cute either. And maybe the fact that there exists the risk of going to the opposite extreme is why women so often hide their passions and hobbies, lest they be perceived that way.

But there's nothing cuter than a girl who's passionate about something. "

"That I talked my mom out of a suicide attempt.

I volunteer at a suicide hotline. I often take calls from people on the brink of jumping or pulling the trigger. Everyone who calls us are anonymous to us on the caller display.

I worked late one evening and got a call transferred to me from a lesser experienced responder because the person on the phone was very nonresponsive to questions and apparently said they had a gun in their hands.

When I picked up the phone and asked what their name was, I immediately recognized my moms voice when she said her name.  
Funnily enough she mentioned that I sounded familiar, like her son. I asked if that was a problem to her, because then I could hand her over to my colleague.  
She told me ""no, at least I feel like I'm confessing to a person I love.""

Then she went on about her failed adulthood. A husband she didn't love anymore. Rapes by her now-deceased father etc.  
It was tough just sitting there and receive the burdens of a lifetime dumped onto you by your own mother.

We talked for about 2 hours and she put away her gun (I heard it releasing the mag) and hung up.  
I called my dad right after asking him where mom was. She had apparently just walked in the door when I called. Knowing their house, she must've been in the shed (dad's man cave).

I don't know if she knew it was me or not. But she hasn't mentioned anything and I'm not going to.

While driving I picked up their conversation which they were not even attempting to hide. It was pretty clear that the guy had a girlfriend who was not the girl in the car and that he had just hooked up with this girl. They were currently heading to his girlfriend to explain what had happened. To be clear, he is bringing the girl he was unfaithful with along to explain to his girlfriend that he just fucked her. He tipped well though."

"Up until I was 15 I wasn't allowed a door on my room. 

I wasn't allowed to go to friends houses or parties because my parents didn't know the parents of my friends but would completely blank them if we ever bumped into them at the store or the school gates etc. 

I wasn't allowed to have friends over because my parents didn't know them. 

I wasn't allowed to play any sport up until I was 16 because training and games would always happen to fall on 'family time' which usually consisted of sitting there in silence watching whatever tv shows my parents liked. 

If I'd been anywhere near grass or sometimes even just outside I wasn't allowed to sit on the furniture because my clothes were dirty so had to sit on the floor. But I wasn't allowed change my clothes because it would mean more washing for my mother. 

I wasn't allowed more than one shower a week because I didn't pay the bills so eventually I would just go to my grans every day after school and shower. This led to me being grounded for 3 months when they found out what I was doing. 

If I ever asked for something specific for food I would be made to eat it every day until I couldn't face eating it anymore. I remember once being made to eat a plate of mini sausage rolls every meal, every day for 5/6 weeks. 

If I finished my homework quicker than my parents deemed it SHOULD take they would rip it up because I clearly hadn't put enough effort into it so would have gotten a bad mark anyway, so what difference would it make if I didn't hand it in. This would mean I got a shit load of detentions and then got grounded for having detention. 

When I finally turned 16 I just said fuck it and did the things I wanted to do. I joined rugby teams, my gran paid for my boots etc. I was selected for regional and international trials multiple times. My parents refused to take me. My friends mother would come to the house to take me every time and try to talk sense into my parents. My parents would threaten call the police if she didn't get off their property. 

I could go on and on for days. 

I left just before I turned 17, moved in with my aunt and my parents called the police and told them my aunt had kidnapped me. The police came and I told them the truth. They went and told my parents there was nothing they could do about it and I've barely spoken to my parents since. That was 12 years ago. 

I have my own child now, and while I tend to worry that I'm not going to be a very good parent because I've never known a good parent myself I at least know what not to do. The rest I'll just have to figure out along the way. 

Edit: thank you all very much for the supportive comments and advice I really appreciate it. I'm out of that situation now and am a much better happier person for it. It took some adjusting to be a person able to have normal relationships/friendships etc instead of following the examples laid out for me by my parents but for the most part it hasn't effected me in later life. There are too many comments to reply to you all but again I really appreciate it. 

Edit 2: my phone has been lighting up like a Christmas tree on drugs for the last few hours so I'll answer a couple of the most common questions. 

They don't have any mental illnesses, at least not diagnosed. 

My gran is amazing. 

I've asked family why they never did anything and they've said they knew my parents would stop them seeing me or try to turn me against them. I don't blame them in the slightest. 

There never seemed to be a leader and an enabler. They were both as bad as each other. 

I don't see the value in confronting them about it. I've moved on with my life and need nothing from them. 

Why did they do it? Well that's a little more complicated. I honestly don't know but I have my theories.

(Deleted this bit because I just got identified. Fucking great 👍🏻) 

So yeah. That's that. I'll be honest this is the most therapeutic thing I've ever done. Again thank you for all of your comments and messages. "

"Worked in a family owned pharmacy for a few years. Find yourself a family owned pharmacy if you a) don't want to go through your insurance b) don't have insurance or c) you'd like to support the working class and not walmart or CVS. People would call us and ask for a cash price for their medication. We would be hundreds of dollars cheaper than walmart on almost every prescription. I remember quoting someone a 90 day medication at $20 and they said walmart was going to charge $250. The reason I said the things about not going through insurance is because insurance companies tell the pharmacy how much to charge you and tell the pharmacy how much the medications cost. Shit, add insurance companies to this list. Family owned pharmacies are losing so much money because of the way insurance companies work.

Edit: I can't spell

Edit 2: wow this blew up while I was at work! Okay so by reading the comments it sounds like what I said is true at most places but that doesn't mean there aren't pharmacies that are more expensive. It depends on where you live I guess! 

Also, Thanks for the gold!!!

"After my divorce I moved out of the house and into this ""luxury"" apartment on the 3rd floor of this brand new building. Unfortunately, the view from my bedroom was of a Kmart parking lot, but I would sit on my bed and watch people go in and out of the store occasionally.  

One day a particularly hot blonde was walking from her car to the entrance, and I wanted to get a closer look so in a rush I pulled my scoped hunting rifle out of my closet and ogled through the crosshairs. Over the next few weeks standing next to my bed with a hunting rifle became a fairly common thing. just zooming in on butts and boobs like it was nobody's business.

It wasn't until a friend came over to check up on me that she noticed the rifle up against my nightstand. At first she was worried that I was considering suicide, but then I explained to her that I just use it to watch people go in and out of Kmart. Apparently that's not really a normal thing to do and despite my assurances that I hadn't had ammunition for it in years she insisted on buying me some cheap binoculars.

To the folks looking for logic, you'll find none. No, the parents weren't saving the couch for company. No, the kids didn't have a history of damaging the couch. No, the kids weren't little troublemakers - they were surprisingly well-behaved teens (surprising because of how they were raised). This is about control, not logic.

It really devastated me. It's been a very tough road but I have the best wife ever.

I don't blame my dad. It was an honest reaction. The part that really hurt was when I talked to my wife after he went back and told her about this. I could see the storm clouds on her face as she realized what he had done. I asked her to be honest and she told me that yeah, I'm a fucking wreck. What was she supposed to do? Let me flounder or be my rock and help me get through it all? She told me one of the sweetest things too: she said ""I meant the 'through better or worse part'. I still love you and you are still the same person, just with different packaging."" 

It's weird to be both blessed and cursed at the same time."
"That's when you just say ""no. I am not going to do that. I'm just not. Do with that information what you will"" and watch how what they will no is ""nothing"" because they aren't going to explain firing a good employee to the GM or higher up manager because of something like that. In restaurants, outright firm ""no""s from servers can be pretty jarring to hear from managers, but I've had to bring it out several times in the past and every single time there were no consequences except for me not having to do the unreasonable thing. If you're respectful about it, a good hard working employee anyway, and don't bring it out unless it is a truly unreasonable thing made by not-the-highest-authority it'll work out."

"My parents were slack, my best friends parents were so strict. She would escape to my house for freedom.

12th grade. Prom. Her parents allowed her to go to prom but said she wasn't allowed to dance.
We all went to prom, had fun dancing. Until she saw her parents standing at the back watching.

She then moved out for university. After her first year, she came home to work for the summer. She had been on her own for a year and supporting herself and her parents gave her a 9pm curfew.
She spent a lot of time at my house that summer. She was married by the next summer and didn't have to deal with it.

"Debt collectors will have ""detectives"" call you from a number that appears to be a legitimate law enforcement agency when you Google it.  It's actually a spoofed caller ID using a legitimate agency's fax number.  The ""detective"" will threaten arrest and throw around names of local judges.  The debt collector will claim to not know the ""detective"" who left the message, but will be willing to take care of your debt.   

EDIT TIME:  Yes, it's illegal, but it's very hard to prove and that's why they do it.  Law enforcement or courts will only call you in the case of theft (like a hot check) but will never call for an old debt.  It's civil and they don't have jurisdiction. "
"My dad basically appealed custody over and over, bringing in new friends to back his character. This forced my mum to seek a barrister/lawyer to defend herself.

My dad is/was a massive problem gambler - had no permanent home and was pretty shit at practical life stuff (nutrition, education, etc.)

This forced my mum to dig into all her savings to pay legal fees to keep a child anybody with a sound mind would know is much more capable than my dad.

So in the end my dad basically made my mother bankrupt trying to get custody over a child he wouldn't have been able to raise.

"I was 13 and on a week long camping trip. There were two adults and five other kids my age. One night we had spent all day kayaking and got caught in a deluge that threw off our whole schedule for the day. We couldn't quite make it to the location where we were supposed set up camp for the night before sunset so we just settled a few meters off of the river. We were so exhausted that the adults didn't even want to build a fire. Since we didn't have much light and it was hot they told us that we didn't have to build our shelters we could just lay out in our sleeping bags. 

Everyone put their sleeping bags near a clearing that was created by a fell tree. But I saw the hole created by the roots and thought that there were possible creepy crawlies living in it. So I set my sleeping bag a little further back about four meters away from the clearing. I woke up a few hours later to these rapid clicking sounds and sniffing. (Thanks to the Internet I later identified it as deer noises.) There were a bunch of them. The clicking grew closer and was surrounded me on all sides. I had my flashlight but I didn't want to shine it because I was afraid to scare the deer/creatures because I thought they would trample me. 

The most vocal deer then stepped on my sleeping bag and eventually sat down on it. I could hear the other deer get comfortable too. After a while I allow myself to peak out (not wearing my glasses) and I see maybe 15 deer/creatures all just watching the other campers. After several hours I fell asleep and woke back up as they were leaving at sunrise. 

It was wholesome/creepy. 

Tl;dr: A herd of deer watched a group of campers sleep all night. One laid down on my sleeping bag with me inside. 

Edit: yes, ticks exist and thanks for doubling my karma!"

"In elementary school, everyone had the chance to be a line leader on his or her birthday. One girl was kind of socially awkward, so on her day she decided to give someone else the title. Our teacher was pissed off because she felt disrespected by this mild change in line leadership, so she exclaimed, ""If you don't want to accept the title I generously gave to you, go to Mrs. P's classroom! I'm trying to be kind to you, but you're being a brat who thinks she has the right to decide who's in charge."" Then, she went off on the other girl for ""indecent behavior"" and ""harassment"" (even though she kind of just yelled at the awkward chick but whatever). Maybe the birthday girl shouldn't have called someone else the line leader, but the teacher took personal offense for something so trivial. "
"The three tiered pricing approach, especially for things like roofing or basement waterproofing.  

The contractor starts with a ridiculously high priced quote for way more stuff than you asked for, steps down to a more moderate quote of what you wanted with a few bells and whistles, then the third quote is for what you requested. 

This gives you the illusion of choice and reduces sticker shock because although your requested ""absolute minimum"" service is really expensive, it's only half the cost of their recommended repairs!"

I didn't end up going to the office because my awesome broadcasting teacher heard the other teacher shouting in the hallway and came out to see what was going on. I did a lot of work for my broadcasting teacher before and after school so he knew me pretty well.

He didn't even wait to find out what was going on before he told the guy to stop shouting and leave me alone. And since the asshole teacher only picked on students, he left without another word, no repercussions."

"Worked at the concession stands at the beach one summer. Whenever responsibilities were given out of who was supposed to do what for that day, one of my co-workers would suck up to the supervisors so that they would give him the clipboard for him to decide who did what. Naturally he never assigned himself anything. After handing out the jobs, he'd go and sit in the little office inside the stand and do nothing while the rest of us worked. 

One time he assigned me the job of cleaning the boardwalk. I was to take a broom and dust pan and walk the entire length of the boardwalk looking for litter to sweep up. The idiot didnt know that the cleaning of the boardwalk wasnt the responsibility of us concession stand workers. That job belonged to the workers employed by the state. We concession stand workers were responsible for the cleanliness of only the small cement patio area directly in the front of our stand. Not the boardwalk too.

I took advantage of his stupidity and I walked down the boardwalk long enough to be out of sight of my concession stand and sat down on a bench for a couple hours or so, resting and relaxing while he was doing the same in the office."

In this case, I was literally less then 10 feet away from it. I was lucky in that it just stood its ground and glared at me, never breaking eye contact. So I was able to back away slowly, and cut my run short and go home. If I took one step closer there is a very real chance it could have attacked and I probably wouldn't be here today."

"Found a crashed plane in the woods with no information about it whatsoever. Pieces were scattered over the area of a football field but the main bits were mostly together. http://imgur.com/a/VYegA

Edit: Added more pics. The plane looked liked it had been there for years judging by the growth, but also looked very recent judging by the condition of the metal. Reported it but there was no report of a plane crash in the area. Bodies could have very well been there.

Edit 2: Found in northern Alberta. The pics aren't great and don't give a great idea of how big it was or how it looked when it was found. The biggest piece found was the wing in the last pic. It was about 3 feet tall and and maybe 20-25 feet long, maybe. The fuselage/cockpit was just behind the camera and was overgrown with what I thought was the cockpit barely sticking out. Faded markings on the wing say something like ""D-10"", that's not what it said but something like that.

"Similar experience.  This was maybe 10 years ago when I was living in Aurora, IL.  I stopped for gas and was about to leave when a car came into the station at high speed.  The car came to a stop and two teenage girls jumped out screaming and hysterical.  I went over to help, at which point they told me a bird had flown into their car while they were driving.  They didn't know what to do and, frankly, neither did I but I have a tendency to jump into situations when people and/or animals are in need.  

I peeked into the car and found that the bird, which was quite large, was either dead or knocked out cold.  He/she apparently flew directly into the rear windshield from the inside and was bleeding from its beak.  Upon closer examination the bird was definitely still alive but not conscious.  I took off my tshirt and wrapped the bird in it, at which point the girls jumped back in the car and took off.  Now I am standing there at a gas station, shirtless, and holding what I would later find out was an unconscious Peregrine Falcon.  

There happened to be a cop inside the gas station and, when he came out, I asked him what I should do.  He had no idea, aside from calling animal control.  I knew first hand that animal control in that area had a ""kill first, help second"" policy so that wasn't the way to go.  

The cop left to pursue more important law enforcement matters, at which point I decided to bring the falcon home with me until I figured out what to do.  Once I got home I started Googling and found a bird sanctuary about an hour away, so I hopped in the car with my new friend and off we went.  At this point the falcon is still wrapped in my tshirt but I put him in a box with the lid open so I could keep an eye on him.  Keep in mind, this is a big bird of prey we are talking about here so it is bit intimidating to drive around with one next to you, unconscious or not. 

Anyway, I get about halfway to the sanctuary when the falcon starts waking up.  I can see him moving around in my peripheral vision and I can hear him/her making noise.  I casually closed the box up while still driving to ensure he/she didn't jump out and try to eat me.  Thankfully, I made it to the sanctuary without incident.  

After I pulled up I grabbed the box and ran it inside, which felt like a scene from an emergency room tv show.  I was expecting to be greeted by someone with a similar sense of urgency about the situation, but the person I talked to acted like it was no big deal.  Nothing to see here - just a giant falcon.  As it turns out, this happens all of the time and they get people like me dropping off injured birds every day.  They even had a form you could fill out to identify yourself and report what happened.  

Fast forward a couple months and I receive a letter in the mail from the bird sanctuary letting me know my falcon friend had been rehabilitated and released back into the wild.  That was a really good feeling, and it is something I think about often.  Given that Peregrine Falcons can live over 20 years from what I have read, I like to think he/she is still out there somewhere living the good life. 

Edit - thanks for the gold!  Sorry, but no pics.  This was a very long time ago.  I might be able to dig up the letter from the bird sanctuary but even that is a long shot.  Sorry!

"On a small sailing boat in the Pacific, sailing south from Panama to Ecuador in the middle of the night. Two people on deck – the helmsman and me, theoretically on lookout but really just there to keep the helmsman awake. It’s well after midnight and we’re away from major shipping lanes. We’re somewhere west of Colombia and we haven’t seen land or another vessel in at least a day (at least, not while I’ve been awake – four hours on, four hours off).
 
And then I see a light off the port bow. It’s far off and distant and under the sail, and therefore hard to keep track of, but it’s there. It isn’t moving. And it seems to flicker and dim but gradually I become aware it’s getting a little brighter, bit by bit. And then I realise it’s a boat, and it’s coming right for us, and by this time I can hear the engine and I yell to the helmsman: “Hard a-port.”
 
(Yes, I used old-timey sailing talk in a crisis. I have no good explanation for this)
 
So we steer to the left, and the oncoming boat passes on the starboard bow. It’s less than 10 metres away, a big RIB with a massive outboard engine at the back travelling at full throttle. There’s enough light from the moon and our running lights to see that there’s only one person aboard, slumped upright over the steering column, and a load of fishing equipment in the back. Then it’s gone into the night, still travelling straight at maximum speed.
 
This was over ten years ago. To this day I have no idea if that midnight fisherman was alive or dead, if he’d fallen asleep at the wheel or suffered a sudden heart attack or what. I don’t know if he powered on until the outboard ran out of fuel and was never seen again, or woke up five minutes later and steered back home. I don’t know what he was doing that far from the other fishing boats (we later saw other lights on the horizon and guessed that they were the fishing fleet), or whether he aimed for us deliberately or if it was sheer coincidence that brought him within spitting distance of our tiny boat in the empty sea. I still wonder sometimes.

**Edit to add:** We called it in to the local authorities with our position and his rough heading, but we only had vague information and we were a long way from shore. I doubt they could have found him, and we never heard back from them."
"My dad actually got fucked by his divorce lawyer during my parents' divorce last year. 

My dad and my sister have never gotten along, and over the years it got more and more strained. They eventually got into a physical fight which led to a CPS report and him getting slapped with a child abuse record (they labeled it as 'confirmed but isolated', so he's not on the registry and you can only see it with certain background checks). 

In this case, my mom was OBVIOUSLY going to get full custody of my sister. My mom also wanted to give my dad the house, and his cars, and his money pit of a boat. 

Lawyer decided, because my dad is stubborn as fuck, that he would string ol' dad along. Lawyer spent HOURS with my dad trying to convince him that Dad could get more money and custody from my mom. 

They did a divorce mediation (so they wouldn't have to go to court), and lawyer dragged it out for 4 hours.

"Was forced to drop out of school in the 5th grade because my grandmother believed that most people have no souls and were demon possessed. 
She said that the world was unsafe to roam freely because Satan was trying to corrupt God's children.

"My mom was insanely controlling about food. Weird rules were in place like ""one slice of lunch meat per sandwich."" No one but her was allowed to cook. She'd make one giant batch of spaghetti or something and we'd have leftovers for days, so she only had to make dinner twice a week. She did not work or anything, just didn't like cooking every day. Breakfast was cold cereal and you'd only be allowed a small bowl with just enough milk to moisten it. Occasionally she'd bake something she called Corn Toasties which was simply cornbread baked in a sheet pan. She'd cut them into squares and fill the freezer with them and we could have one of those for breakfast as an alternative.

Once when I was fourteen I bought a pack of hot dogs at the store, snuck them home, and lit the grill. I was almost done cooking them when she came out screaming about fire hazards and swatted the plate out of my hand. She had been making spaghetti, what an ungrateful little bastard I was.

So then she orders a pizza for the rest of my family, wraps individual servings of spaghetti in freezer paper, and puts them away. She tells me that I will be eating nothing else until it's all gone. Took about two months to choke it all down. Went without eating a lot of days. I was also grounded for over a year.

"So I worked at a ranch in southern Arizona, right on the border. I didn't really consider it to be secluded because I had horses and cows. In hindsight, I guess it was really lonely because sometimes they'd talk back to me. 

Anyways, doing fence borders with a guy from another camp and we had to go down into this dry river bed. As we round the bend we see a bunch of beat up trucks sitting there armed to the teeth. Turns out we ran into some kind of big deal for a cartel. The other guy told me to keep steady and we just walked straight through them on our horses. Everyone staring at us, looking like they were ready to shoot us up if we made one false move. 

I asked about it when we got to the other side without turning into swiss cheese and the more experienced rancher told me: ""The Cartel only cares about Border Patrol and Cops. They know this is a ranch, and they know we roam around here, and they know we don't say much."" Reason being, if they ever assumed the ranchers were the snitches, they could easily find our little ranch houses. Only had 1 person to so many acres. Could have been offed and left there for many days before someone noticed. With all that in mind, I had a very passive relationship with those kind from then on. "

"My step dad has been divorced twice before, both marriages had kids involved. First divorce was mutual, and had shared custody of the kids, second was because he was cheated on and also involved shared custody of kids. 

Wife #1 lived out of state, and kept no-showing, forcing costly legal action every time he wanted to see his kid. Wife #2 was initially supportive of him through this, until they had kids themselves and the cost became too much. Wife #1 wanted him to give up legal rights to their kids, and after years and years of legal battles that nearly bankrupted them, Wife #2 basically gave him an ultimatum - give up the kids, or get divorced. He knew that getting divorced from wife #2 could result in him never seeing his other kids either so eventually he was forced into giving up kid #1. 

A few years later Wife #2 cheats on him, they get divorced, wife #2 tells the kids it was him that cheated, but to never mention it to him in case he gets angry. Initially they were splitting custody very evenly, but eventually wife #2 figured out that she would get more money if she was technically sole custodian, and he would see them on that basis because he loves his children. So to arrange for this to happen she accused him of molesting their youngest child, then used that accusation to gain full custody before the charge was dropped due to total lack of evidence. Then she tells the kids that he did molest them, again something he didn't know she told them for years. 

Upshot is that he was forced to give up first kids permanently by one wife, and then second wife had the rest of his kids think he was a cheater and sexual predator, and thus be terrified of him and never truly love him, so she could save face and pick up a larger check. 

Like Tammy#1 and Tammy#2 on crack.

EDIT: WOW!! This blew up bigger than I thought it would!

"Maybe not dirty, but incompetent contractors will often way underbid jobs. So if you request a bunch of quotes, and all the bids are relatively close except for one that's way lower, there's roughly a 100% chance that guy will screw it up and you'll have a nightmare on your hands. Sometimes you get what you pay for.

Also, FWTW, if a bid is high, it probably means they don't want the job.

Edit: For everyone asking why you would bid high rather than just reject the job, it's considered unprofessional to just not bid a job. It's leaves a sour taste in customers' mouths when you just outright don't even give them a price. Reasons you don't want the job could include.

1. You're out of manpower and can't staff it.
2. There's something about the job that makes you not want to deal with it. For example, fixing an air conditioning that wasn't installed right means you could be looking at a job that is actually going to take months, still not be right after you're done, and the customer could blame you, not the original contractor. No thanks.
3. Customer is an asshole or difficult in some way. He might have non-asshole friends, however, you don't want him badmouthing to. So the goal is don't piss him off, but also try not to work for him either.

Edit 2: Should have put this in the original comment. Sometimes they will outright steal from you or half do a job, take the money and run. They count on you being either too poor or too passive to take them to court."

"Not a driver but a story told to me by a driver after dropping off his previous passengers. This was when I was at uni. I couldn't bother waiting for a bus home so I hired an Über. Luckily there was a guy nearby dropping off a guy and a girl. I knew them, still FB friends with them. They got out and I got in. I said ""hi"" to them and chatted for a few seconds. They said they were going to study for a bit then go to the library to meet up with her boyfriend. I was tired so I just told them to have fun and I'd see them in class the next day. 

The driver overheard most of this talk and said he was surprised the girl had another boyfriend. I asked why and he said she and the guy who was just with her were being very flirty,touchy and kissing on the way over. I was gob smacked a little, saying no that's impossible. I laughed a bit and told him he must have imagined it. He said no he saw them being very affectionate with each other. I'm just sitting back there shocked and not knowing what to say. He said ""I'm sorry to tell this to you but your friend might be kind of a slut if she's cheating on a boyfriend."" 

I'm still trying to process what I've been told. A little while later he drops me off at home. Before I get out I tell him, ""I'm sorry I seem a bit shocked but my friends, the guy and girl you just dropped off at the uni, they're brother and sister!""

He was like ""Fuck off, you serious?"" Almost as shocked as I was. I wasn't completely sure whether what the driver told me that day was the truth or not. For a while I convinced myself he was bullshitting me and knew they were brother and sister, but I noticed other stuff afterwards that kinda confirmed it."

"Applying for a job in person.

I've been professionally employed for 15 years and my wife has been a stay-at-home mother.  When our son turned 16 we started driving him around to apply for jobs in person and they looked at us like we were crazy.

First off, you apply online and second, no one around here will give a job to anyone under 18 and they want you to have previous experience even then, which is  a ridiculous catch-22.  The amount of people working in the back of a lot of these fast food chains in their fucking late 20's and early 30's only really dawned on me recently.  If you were over, say, 25 and still working in fast food when I was a teenager, then you were a complete loser.  

It was culture shock.  I walked into a grocery store the day I turned 16 back in the 90's and walked out with a job as a cashier.  No sweat.  Now it's a fucking competition to get a job dropping french fries in a vat of grease."

Finding someone that you respect as a person is way more important than the status bullshit of degrees and cash. I'd take my husband over a hundred high earners. Just because he didn't get a piece of paper doesn't mean that he's not intelligent, and just because he doesn't earn as much doesn't mean he's not successful. Without his support I'm sure I wouldn't be where I am.

"Not a lawyer, but I met with a scummy one when I was looking to get a divorce. The first lawyer I met with, who had been recommended by a coworker as an amazing divorce attorney, suggested that, if I wanted full custody, I should make sure people knew the relationship was abusive. Tell my friends/family, make sure the neighbors heard me screaming/begging him not to hit me, document every bruise even if I wasn't sure it came from him. Thing is, my relationship wasn't abusive and I'd already told her that multiple times. She never outright said I should fabricate evidence or anything, but she ignored my repeated statements that there was no abuse and kept on with her detailed instructions of how to document any abuse that might happen. I got the distinct impression that she was letting me know how to create an abusive relationship out of thin-air in order to get custody of my kids.

I ended up not using her as an attorney, for obvious reasons, and in the end my ex and I shared 50/50 physical and legal custody of our children and raised them together despite whatever issues we had with each other. I can't help but wonder, though, how many dads lost a relationship with their kids because of her zealous coaching."

"I work for a company similar to Uber. Oftentimes you have to play therapist for drunk customers, they will lay out very personal details about their lives to you. One customer told me about how her ex-husband has been hospitalized several times due to complications from alcoholism, and that they told him that the next time he comes in, he'll likely die. She told me that she really hopes that the father will die before her 17 year old son turns 18 because she doesn't want him to have the responsibility of having to decide to pull the plug.

Another ride started with the customer asking if I played Overwatch, and within 5 minutes she was crying and telling me about her friend who committed suicide.

One ride I couldn't find the window button (we drive the customers home in their own cars), so the customer reached over for it, very clearly moving her hand across my groin on the way. She also refused to sign her check unless she could write her number on my arm, and slapped my ass as I walked away.

Another customer asked me for change, and I handed it to him as his other hand was on his dick, peeing in his front yard.

ANOTHER customer, whose car interior was absolutely covered in cigarette ash and butts, told me about how her daughter recently got hooked on meth by her boyfriend, and how she hates black men because her black father left her as a child when he went to prison.

I could go on.

When I was probably 7, I went in with my Dad to get pizza. 7-year-old me loved my dad, and while we waited in line to order I told him multiple times that he was the best and that I loved him, hugging his legs and holding his hand before running off to play with the jukebox they had set up.


We order the pizza, and sit around what seems like an uncomfortably long time for carry out pizza.


Suddenly, three cop cars pull up, and a few officers walk inside. They grab my dad and take him outside while another two come up to me.

"I once took a girl home from a party that was way, WAAAAAY out of my league. I mean i'm not an ugly fella, but this girl might just as well have been another species. 

The party was in a student housing complex and i was actually rather bored and just wanted to go home. My flatmates dragged me there and i pretty much just wanted to leave from the start.
One of my flatmates wouldn't let me go unless i talked to at least one girl first, so i eventually relented.

As i didn't really have much interest in talking to anyone, i just walked up to some girl at the bar and told her: ""Hey, sorry to disturb you, i really just want to go home, but my flatmate made me promise him to at least talk to some girl first. So can we just pretend to have a conversation for a minute, then you give me an annoyed look and walk away?"" 

I only saw the back of her head when i approached her, so i didn't realize how stunning she was before. At first she looked at me confused, but then she started to laugh and we actually got a conversation going. Anyway, for the rest of the night we consumed a good bit of alcohol, played catch in the dark, accidentaly locked my flatmates out of the appartment for half an hour on the balcony in the freezing December cold, fooled arround with each others genitals, you know, the usual stuff. 

Later in the night, i woke up when she sat up in bed. She started to get out of bed and stood up, but apparently got dizzy and sat back down on the edge of the bed. After sitting back down, she promptly started pissing. Not in the bed thankfully, she sat kind of awkwardly on the edge and just let loose like a firehose on my bedroom floor.

I was just thinking WTF????! and didn't know what to do. So drawing on my small woodland critter reflexes, i just pretended to still be asleep.

After she was done pissing, she made a pittyfull sound and stood up again, probably to go to the bathroom to clean herself up i guess. She made like 2 steps, slipped on her piss puddle and slammed into the wet ground. 

Now this was so loud, i couldn't convincingly pretend to be asleep anymore, and i was kinda worried she just accidentaly killed herself. 

So i got out of the bed, made sure she was ok and put her back in the bed on a little towel. Then i cleaned my floor and her shirt that lay next to the bed and got a little pissed on and lay back next to her.

The next morning was rather awkward, but i told her not to worry, that stuff like that happens and drove her home.

Unfortunately she was so completely mortified that she basically avoided all contact with me afterwards. Either that, or she just realized that she was way out of my league, and could easily find better guys floors to piss on.

Most people didn't notice though and he sold that same can of cream corn maybe twenty times a day. 
"Typing this quickly because I am about to go on my lunch break. I have posted this story before on a since-deleted account, so if it sounds familiar, that's why.

I grew up in a very rural area in the Deep South, and spent most of my time riding my horse alone in the National Forests and expansive private properties that bordered our house. There was an old abandoned house about 2 miles' ride through the woods from me, and I often rode by it on my journeys through the woods. Sometimes I tied my horse up outside, went in, and explored inside it but there was really nothing of interest. There was just trash and things like electric bills from the '80s. I think an old woman used to live there based on some pictures that I found.

Time went on and I went away to college, taking my horse with me. I no longer rode past this abandoned house. After graduating college, my horse and I moved back home for a little while, and I decided to go back and explore it again. 

So, I rode my horse the ~2 miles through the deep woods to get to this house, which is itself probably 1000 feet from a lonely gravel road that cuts through the forest. It is very secluded and almost creepy. The house is about 3 miles from a paved road. 

I am less brave than I used to be, so when I entered the house I felt out-of-place and slightly scared. But I used my cell phone light to explore the rooms anyway. A lot was just as I remembered, but right as I was about to leave, I found a calf skeleton in the corner of the entry room.

I have no idea how this calf got shut up inside the building. The doors were firmly shut when I approached it. Also, the screen door opened one way, while the actual door opened the other, so that it was impossible for both to be open at once for some creature to accidentally wander in. Furthermore, the nearest cow pastures are a good bit away from the house. 

I left the abandoned house with the image in my head of some deviant cruelly trapping a calf in there for sick purposes.

[Here are some images!](http://imgur.com/a/oPTNk) I took the picture of the house as I was leaving, hence why the screen door is open. It was shut when I approached. 

**Tl;dr:** found calf skeleton mysteriously trapped in old house in middle of nowhere.

EDIT: everyone is hung up on the amount of Crisco in the kitchen. I personally never thought that was odd, but I am from a Southern family where having a lot of Crisco is normal. I mean, four cans might be a bit much, but maybe they were on sale? 

EDIT EDIT: I might be back in the area of the abandoned house this weekend and could go back to investigate again and take more pictures. No longer have my horse but could visit on foot. On one hand, it would be an epic OP delivery. On the other hand, I am female and don't really feel like getting murdered by some calf-abducting squatter.

"When he blamed the loan company.

I said I had $20,000 in student loan debt. He said he had something like $20,000, too. He then changed his answer to $40,000. Then thought about it and didn't know. I pressured him to actually figure it out.... turns out, he owed $120,000 in student loans. He blamed the loan company for not telling him how much he was taking out. He blamed them for making him pay it all back. I pointed out that the information was on the forms he signed every year. He said that it was unrealistic for them to make him read all of that information.

"Catching a methed out young woman rummaging through tools in my Dad's garage. The face she gave me when she realized a larger male had confronted her in a confined space was one of pure terror and she was ready to claw my eyes out to survive what she most likely perceived as a threat. When she turned to run out of the garage my police officer dad caught her by the arm and held her down until the police arrived. Watching her fight, beg, and plead that we won't rape her or kidnap her was pretty heartbreaking when we had the best intentions in mind of getting professionals to handle her drug infused meltdown. The struggle was strong enough that we decided we should hand cuff her to keep her from hurting herself or us. Come to find out later she was on the run and being chased by police because she thought she was being chased and in danger of being kidnapped inside of a hotel. We were her worst nightmare in her mind and it sure as hell looked like it.

"Local Bike Shop. I was about to buy a brand new bike for 1200 and the owner of the shop said to hold on and ran upstairs to grab a bike that was a year old but never used, sold it to me at cost. Saved 500 bucks and they've serviced it for free every time I go in. The guys who work on the bikes are just as passionate about riding and fixing bikes. The salesman had greasy hands, I trust people who work on what they sell.

"My in-laws are mega into food and wine, as in they literally travel the world on food and wine tours, are part of clubs, etc. They told me about a nasty divorce where the husband was the wine aficionado, not the wife, but the wife was pissed off about getting divorced. The husband got all the wines in their extensive cellar, but before he was able to correct them, the wife soaked every bottle to remove ALL of the labels. So technically the wine was not damaged, but the husband had no way to know what he was drinking for aging and pairing purposes (which is a huge deal to wine drinkers)."

Instead of her grabbing my dick as it had panned out in my mind she damn near pissed herself laughing at my boner sticking out of the middle of these bright yellow briefs I had on. She was laughing so much we couldn't have sex, bit we still have a laugh at it whenever we remember (or when I wear the underwear) "
"In 1984, FIFA decided to hold the first women's world tournament (Later became the world cup). Fifa basically went to all of the countries and said ""assemble your team"" with very little advanced notice and the USA didn't have much in terms of leadership for women's soccer. 

So they picked a team who had won nationals many times in a row and had a 400-9 winning record. A lot of people don't know this story because the whole thing was so disorganized, and it wasn't branded as the ""world cup"" just yet. 

My mom was on that team and scored a few times some of the first goals for the USA Women's soccer team in history. Her team was the first United States soccer team, male or female, to win a major international tournament.

I bought their rice cooker.  It's amazing.  Best rice cooker I ever owned by a mile.  


I bought their water kettle because I love tea and it can do all the temperatures needed for black, oolong, or green easily.  It's great to have those on tap and works wonderfully at supplying that.  

I bought their vacuum sealed travel mug... if anything it's too good.  I have to cool my tea to 160° before I put it in or I'll burn my mouth on it 4 hours later.  It's still noticably warm the next day.  I've had that through six years now, with quite a lot of abuse I've put it through, and I still don't have a second thought about tossing it in any bag because it's never leaked a drop.

"Dyson appeals to people who want style over substance. If that's what you want, ala Beats headphones, that's fine. I have a few style over substance things of my own. But these Dysons are subpar, performance for the price wise.

Dyson anything is 3-5x the price with half the effectiveness of the normal options. And their marketing uses buzzword bullshit to make people think that they do something that no one else does.

For example,

""Bladeless design for safe operation
Plus, without fast spinning blades or awkward grilles, it's simple to clean.""

There's a [tiny fucking fan in the base pointing up](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7fiAPBbWwzI/TiLrPU-4LLI/AAAAAAAAzHk/Qc3kv9C9iF4/s640/Dyson-Air-Multiplier-Fan-Without-Blades-2604146591.jpg). When those blades get dirty it actually takes more work to clean.

""Air Multiplier technology provides high-velocity cooling air flow
Surrounding air is drawn into the airflow and amplified. No blades, no choppy air.""

For one, it does have a fan as established. And for two, that's what every single fan does. They all ""draw in air"" and get it moving faster. That's a fan's job. And they choppy air thing is pure bullshit. No one has ever been in front of a regular fan and thought, ""damn this air is choppy"".

Go to somewhere like BestBuy where several fans are on display and plugged in. These Dyson fans put out a pathetic amount of air for their size and price. A $350 Dyson fan is as effective as a regular $50 fan.

"We had a secretary who was on the verge of being fired, and they she started to date the son of the owner of our company. Magically things turned around for her. 

Our old secretary would order herself lunch when we'd order out for clients or meetings. She'd only give us order forms for where she'd like to eat, and places that weren't 'buffet' style catering. 

No one really noticed what she was doing until one day where she'd bring in the food, and we handed out everyones meal to everyone in the meeting. One person's meal was completely wrong. She came in and apologized and exchanged the one she grabbed before she would deliver the food to the board room. After she started dating his son, she'd just order what she wanted and was open about it. 

She was also in charge of purchasing for the office. If you needed supplies, you'd go through her. If she didn't like you, she'd forget to order what you needed. People would go months without supplies they requested. Stuff like USB hubs and flash drives would have to be bought with personal money then reimbursed. 

She'd complain about how busy she is and how she doesn't have time to do all of her tasks. She would often concentrate so hard at times she'd fall asleep at her desk. Or she had to get a third monitor so she could be more productive, but it apparently was used so she could have youtube on full screen. She didn't think it was fair she couldn't wear headphones because she had to listen to doorbell incase we had a visitor. She needed bigger monitors which unfortunately blocked her view of the door so she couldn't see if someone was there. Somehow we got a camera system installed so she'd be able to see if someones at the door. She didn't have a coat rack in the entry way, so instead of putting her coat on the back of her chair like other people, she'd pick a random office and use their coat rack. 

She was in charge of stocking the employee coffee area. She decided she didn't want to do that anymore, so she just quit doing it. 

She was in charge of setting up the board room for meetings. Eventually she decided it wasn't her job and the meeting holder should be in charge of doing that. She just didn't tell anyone she wasn't doing it anymore and people would show up to meetings with the fridge empty, no coffee, etc. Eventually when someone asked her she said ""That's not my job"". It became everyone else's job. 

She'd get new responsibilities to do, and she'd be terrible at them. Claim she was too busy, yet constantly had youtube up, taking naps, etc. She'd put enough effort into tasks to half ass them to make it look like she tried. We'd have to send documents back to her multiple times to get little things fixed. She'd often say ""Wouldn't it be easier if you fixed it yourself?"". Eventually responsibilities she had would get taken away, or if you asked her, she'd delegate her responsibilities. 

Eventually she quit to work for his sons portion of the business. Everyone is an employee of every portion of the business here. Except for her. She's an employee for that one sector. 

To be totally honest, with her gone, things have been so much more pleasant. We replaced her with an awesome person who's doing a great job and accepts all the responsibilities. New Sec. has made our work life so much easier. "

"When I was 14, my friend and were drinking at my house when my parents weren't there. (I lived in a small town and there wasn't much to do, not that I'm defending 14 year olds drinking, I'm just giving context.) My sister, 4 years my elder, had a 1997 Honda Civic in the garage. My friend and I thought it would be a good idea to stealthily open up the garage door, push it down the road, hop in, turn it on, and go for a little joy ride on the country roads. It was a rainy day so the roads were still slick, and I got the great idea to pull the e-brake and do a bit of a slide. I slide directly into a ditch. The front bumper mounts break and the hub cap is slightly bent into the rubber of the wheel. We take it back home and begin to drunkenly try to fix it with zip ties and crow bars. It was a shoddy job but it held. About a week later, my sister gets into a low speed car accident on that exact side of the bumper. She still doesn't know, but I bet the mechanic working on her car knew something was up. This was 13 years ago."

"My high school did an end of year celebration (on campus, during school time, it was just the graduating year and the year below us so it wasn't _that_ disruptive) but to prevent it getting out of control, the school hired 4 security guards.

I'd say there were around 700 students and he just refused to let us leave until another security guard had to fight through the crowd to let him know he was being a dick, he unlocked the gate I was at and then unlocked the others

"T.J. Miller once hoisted me up and carried me out of a building.

[Proof](http://imgur.com/a/64TgX)

EDIT: Alright I wasn't sure if adding context would ruin the story or anything but here it is. So basically I'm a college student on our school's programming board. This past year I was able to plan my first large scale comedy show and I chose to bring T.J. Miller. The show was great and what we do after every show is let the entire board (around 20ish people) get in a group photo with the talent, and the person who organized the event (in this case me) gets an individual picture. After we took the photo, T.J. looked around and said ""Wait, is YesLikeTheJeans the person who's responsible for bringing me?"" and when everyone said yes he said ""Let's hoist him in the air!"" After they carried me out of the building he yelled ""Now let's throw him in the bushes!"" which was funny because a police officer was right there, and after T.J. Noticed he said ""Never mind, set him down!""\

T.J. was a super nice guy and very down to earth. As I was walking him back to his car he said that he was going to smoke a cigarette and asked if I wanted to stay and talk to him (which of course I did). The conversation was directed toward me and he asked me what I studying in school, about my family, and what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. He seemed genuinely interested and when I told him I wanted to pursue a career in television/ comedy writing he talked to me about tips on how to succeed in such a difficult field. Here I am, standing in an empty parking lot in the middle of the night, talking to one of my favorite people in the world, discussing my future. It was definitely one of the coolest moments of my life, and T.J. is one of the nicest people alive.

"When I was at college I was at a bar and had (miraculously) started a conversation with a group of 6 cute female nursing students.

So he leaves, and a different bar tender comes up to me and asks what I'll have to drink. I ordered 7 long island iced teas and said, ""Yeah, put it on my tab, name is Justin!"". To this day this is the most horrible thing I have ever done.

Yeah, I knew where to find that, and along the way, he said he was looking for some ""medicine"", too, so we stopped in the ghetto and got him something to ""smoke"". Could've been weed or crack or anything, I don't know, and I didn't ask.

After being told ""fuck you, cop"" more than once, we found a pretty young lady of the evening, he asked where she's been all night, she said she's been right there waiting for him, she got in the car, they kissed and groped in the back seat on the way back to the resort, and he gave me a decent tip.

One year when I was about 9 my task was to help sell the little potted geraniums: $0.25 each.  Well, no one was buying any of them, so I had a brilliant idea: I made a new sign that said ""Buy 1 for $1, get 3 free"".  Those little geraniums sold like hot cakes after that.  I was so proud of myself I told the principal.  He did not approve, though he let me do it anyway.

"My best friend growing up had the thing about not asking where we were going or really any question at all. Her parents didn't like being asked questions so you had to avoid it at all costs. 

You also weren't allowed to drink with your meals. It was strange because we always get drinks with our food in my family. It's hard for me to eat without drinking cause my mouth and throats get dry and hurt and I would basically be choking but you couldn't get a drink of water until after you were finished eating. If you said you were done to get something to drink and then wanted more food they would say ""No you had your drink now you can't eat anymore."" It was very odd I really don't understand it. I avoided meals there as much as possible. 

Edit: for those who keep bringing it up, no their family was not weirdly religious and no it was not about weight or health.. everyone was healthy and of normal weight. They just didn't allow you to drink with your food. I never heard them explain why.

"Mine wasn't so much seeing something as it was experiencing. When I was 11 my dad committed suicide, and I had absolutely no way of properly handling the situation. When I was told the news I didn't even react, I just sat there quietly because my brain couldn't comprehend the idea that the man who was my best friend decided to leave me behind. 

I made up all of these excuses in my head about what had really happened, the most realistic being that he had faked his own death and was just trying to get away from everything. Even his funeral didn't mean too much to me, as he was cremated, so it fell into my story of him still being alive.

It took me about 3-4 years to really understand everything, meaning that it clicked in my head. I started to notice all of the weird details that I hadn't realized when I was younger. Things like the time that I came downstairs and he was just sobbing for no reason, or the looks of devastation he would have on his face from time to time, despite our family having fun at an amusement park. His suicide note topped it off, as I wasn't told that he had written one until around that time. He talked about how me and my sister were his world, and that he wished he could stay around and see us grow up, but the world was just too much for him.

I learned that he was extremely bipolar, and that's why he would have those fits of rage followed by sadness that I had just deemed his personality. I ended up becoming extremely fearful that I would end up like he did, and am honestly still scared every time I get angry or sad. It wasn't something that was immediate, or something that you can see and quickly look away from. It was a realization that my best friend was so mentally ill that he could not stand to keep himself alive. And that's the scariest thing I could ever possibly imagine."

"When I was younger I kicked a ball over the fence of my dads friends house and naturally I stepped on the fence and poked my head over to see how far it had gone. I saw a man a decent distance away in the backyard so I called out asking if he could pass my ball back over but he wasn't responding so I asked my sister if I was seeing it right she looked and thought it was a scarecrow. I went to tell my Dad and his friend and they looked at it and called out but still nothing. They jumped the fence to check it out and it turned out I was calling out to a man who had hung himself to pass my ball back over. Few cops etc came that's about all there is to the story, it wasn't really scary just creepy. I was pretty young but it didn't really get to me or anything I do remember it pretty decently though."

"After multiple combat deployments, IEDs, bullets and things that whiz by with shitty intent, the one moment that always stuck out to me was in a humanitarian deployment.

We were dealing with a pretty aggravated crowd of Haitians and it was a food distribution point. There was a church on top of this massive hill in Port Au Prince and a local charity group had this large truck they were trying to get up to it. The Haitians had crowded the entrance so we were trying to get them to split up so this truck could attempt to get up this rocky, slick as fuck hill.

We finally split them up and the truck gave it a go, revving up as much as it could till it passed the crowd and attempted the hill. I originally had my arms spread out as I was holding the crowd back. Once I heard the truck pass me, I took a step back. Immediately I felt someone grab me and pull me into the crowd. I thought I was getting jumped. 

I felt this fucking truck brush against my uniform as it didn't make the hill and rolled back down it. I don't mean a simple brush either. I felt the truck complete left side brush against my uniform and gear. I would have been crushed if it wasn't for this old Haitian woman reached out and grabbed my clueless ass to prevent this massive truck from running me over. She reached out with a bear hug, embraced me and pulled me into the crowd that was already leaning into the nearby brick wall.

After all the explosions, firefights, vehicle incidents, jumping from airplanes... that one still scared me the fucking most."

"When I was 9, my sisters locked me outside of our house on the porch. The only problem was that I had to shit really bad. So I screamed and begged them to let me in... and they wouldn't budge. So I started to pound on the window, until, suddenly, my hand went completely through the window, shattering the window and getting shards of glass stuck in my hand while all at the same time getting shards of shit in my pants.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: Many people are asking what happened afterwards. My grandmother was called over (since my parents were both busy at work), and she had to pick out all the chunks of glass from my hand, which was extremely painful because of her diabetes and arthritis which made her hands have the inability to stay steady. I'm pretty sure I still have glass in my hand to this day. Yes I did change out of my poop and blood soaked pants before receiving first aid. I was treated like royalty for a week straight from my parents who acted as if I underwent life saving surgery, and my two sisters were grounded for a couple days, but of course they will never let me forget the day I shit my pants."

In the end, after she racked up **$1.5 million in legal fees, and 7 different lawyers**, the judge said this shit is ridiculous -- there was no conspiracy, and you are not entitled to a portion of this phantom $20 million.

Mind you: this was a major law firm partner who was acting this way. She made millions per year in her career. But she apparently lost her mind. "

"Not a divorce lawyer, but I did surgical rotations with an OB/Gyn, and have personally seen the lowest of the low:

In divorce hearings, people say a lot of shit when trying to place blame or get custody. A lot of it is straight up lies. Not all lies can be erased or taken back. The worst one is an accusation of sexual abuse. YOU CAN NOT REDACT AN ACCUSATION OF SEXUAL ABUSE AGAINST A MINOR.

It happened ridiculously more frequently than I can stomach. A spouse, trying to get the upper hand, makes the claim. Now the lawyer/court/state is bound by law to investigate. And suddenly that precious, innocent child that mommy is trying to gain custody of is brought to the OR, sedated, and then investigated inside and out for evidence of abuse. 

Those are about the only days that nobody in the entire wing says anything. No jokes, no smiles. Just a sick feeling in your stomach that takes away all appetite and joy. 

So many times, the parent who makes the accusation finds out what they're about to put the child through, and tries to take it back. Tries to cancel the procedure, tries to say they may have been confused or mistaken, or even admits they flat out lied. Doesn't matter. Once that box is opened, the investigation must continue.

Of the couple dozen cases I saw, I can only recall one that supported the accusation. "
"My father was very very strict. I wasn't allowed to have alone time with my mother. He beat the shit out of me constantly. But the oddest thing that still bugs me to this day, is that he would burn all my things as punishment. And I get it, seeing my Toys and valuables burning sucked, and I probably learned some lessons. But he not only burned toys, he would burn EVERYTHING. 
Every year or so for school we would go to Meijer and buy me new school clothes and shoes. He would also burn those, like sometimes days after he bought them. At 8 years old I remember thinking...you now have to buy me more clothes. But that wasn't the point I suppose.
He once took me to the palace of auburn hills in Detroit to see the globe trotters one year and during the night he bought me a globe trotters basketball and jersey. We had a fun night.
The very next day, I had left something on the floor in my room and his punishment, among other things, was to burn the basketball and jersey he bought for like 150 dollars less than 24 hours earlier. It just never made sense to me.

I complained and they kept me on the previous plan, saying I was grandfathered in since I'd had a membership for like 5 years. 

Edit: It's only a $1/month increase. I suck at math. 

Edit #2: To clarify, I meant to correct the part where I said ""it looked like a small $2/month increase."" $18 × 2 = $36, up from $35/month, looks like a $1/month increase, but it's that plus the 2 extra payments per year, plus the extra opportunities for them to collect late fees.

"I used to spend a lot of time hiking solo. The creepiest thing I ever saw was another human, in camouflaging clothes, hiding off the edge of a trail in the brush and trees and obviously keeping an eye on anyone who happened by. 

Edit to add: This wasn't in an area where hunting is allowed, just a county area with some hiking/biking trails (and lots of spots to go off trail), and he wasn't fishing. Here, there is just a few meters of dense brush and trees between me and the river. I pretended I didn't see him, walked a bit, pulled out my phone, called someone, and stayed on the phone until I was near people.

They have a holiday home in the south pacific and have a housekeeper clean it three times a week yet they only visit 3-4 times a year. When they're not visiting, no one lives there.

When the family go out for dinner, the father will happily pay for the expensive meals but not the drinks. The kids (who are all teens or older) have to pay him back for the drinks and he will send reminder messages about the amount. Yet when any of the kids offer to pay for the meal, he won't accept.

The wife is a hoarder and will often take way more samples than any normal person. She always makes sure to take all the shampoo/soap etc from hotel rooms and if she passes the housekeeping trolley, will grab as many as she can from there too. Yet she never uses them. They have a whole bathroom cupboard dedicated to samples. "
"Back when I lived with my parents, there was a woman on the HOA that lived across the street from us (both houses were on the corner). She decided that there was too much traffic on the street in front of her house in the morning, so she decided to put up an official-looking sign stating that no one could turn right at the stop sign in front of her house from 6AM to 3PM. Mind you, people were turning right at that corner because there was an elementary school located on the street behind her house and many people needed to drive there, but she didn't care, it was ""disrupting"" her and she wasn't going to allow it. However, I also needed to turn there to get out of the neighborhood for work, so one night a few days after she put up the sign, I stole it. She put it up again, I stole it again. She responded by selling her house. Justice was served."

I opened it up, expecting a tee-shirt and maybe their entry-level keyboard, but I was totally wrong. They did send me a tee-shirt, but there was so much more. They had also sent me their newest high end keyboard, a new mouse, an extra large mouse mat, a headset, and a Blue Yeti microphone.

Corsair has always been a stand-up company. Even before the care package, I was a fan of their products, but the level of customer service and outreach that they demonstrate regularly is top-notch. I can't imagine ever buying another company's gear.

"""You cant have privacy"" literally quoted from my dad"
"Not a throwaway; I can own this story. 

Back in high school, I was sometimes a less than stellar person. I went to a school with a dorm

We had prank wars. My most favorite took place in the winter when the vents were blowing hot air into people's rooms. I had an RC truck with a trunk I would fill with raw crab meat. I would drive it from room vent to room vent on a rotation of a few days per week. I like to think of their vent as my crustacean bus station. The rooms were all in a line of a wing, with the other side being womens dorms. So I had a straight track there and back for my meat truck (no turning or navigating), and would only drive it when I could be sure no one was in the rooms (dinner usually).

I could maneuver by driving straight and I could tell where rooms were by the rectangle of light shining down into the vent/bus station. (I had a little hand mirror I would angle down my own vent to see). 

Kids were waking up and running to other kids' rooms to sleep. Many times they may even vomit when they open the door to their room if it festered all weekend. 

I would complain about the smell myself so it would throw the dorm staff off. I knew my dad was the one they would call for maintenance, so I would just wait until he texted me he was coming by (usually to take me out to dinner since he's in town), and pull out the RC car that day. I would then hide the meat in my room and the RC car under my bed. It was just so simple, so evil, and so well executed time and time again.

Never was caught. This is still amusing enough to me that when laying awake at night remembering it, I still sometimes laugh to the point of tears. 

Tl;Dr: during winter I would drive my ""meat truck"" up and down the vents of our dorm, blowing warm; raw seafood smell into different rooms every night. 

Edit: SOMEONE GILDED THE MEAT TRUCK.

Edit2: New name I came up with: the crustacean bus station

Edit3: people wondering about battery life; I would charge it just the right amount that this wasn't ever an issue, but I had a string attached to it if it ever did get stuck. I would have just pulled it back to my room. "

"Obligatory-not-a-lawyer but my parents are currently going through a divorce. Luckily kids are all in late 20s/30s so no custody battle, but basically my mum is a nutter and is desperately trying to screw my dad over as much as humanly possible. She told her lawyer that he has SO MANY hidden assets, when in fact he has none. She lied and told the mediator that he has a record collection worth hundreds of thousands, when in fact it's probably worth like £8. She said his guitar collection was worth tens of thousands, whereas second hand value, like maybe £2k. She wants all of his businesses assets. All of them. She wants both houses. Her lawyer repeatedly reminds her that at most she'd get half of everything, but she clearly doesn't listen. Then she demanded back all of our (the kids) Christmas and birthday presents from our childhood, like the violin they bought me when I was 13. It's hers. Obviously. /s. Her lawyer laughed at her and reminded her that's not how divorce works.

They're still in the very early mediation process, so it'll be interesting to see how shit goes once they actually get started properly. Interestingly, despite her hollering that it's all my dad's fault, she was the one that walked out, and subsequently shacked up with my Dad's brother, WHO'S WIFE HAD DIED 3 WEEKS EARLIER.

They made sure to keep a bored look on their face, taking their time, and even take a lunch break. Everyone assumed they were contracted by the city to do a mural of some sort.

I think it was supposed to be a quirky, slightly hopeless romance, but after it was done I went into a state of realizing how finite our time is here and how little time we spend loving the people around us and relishing the experience of being alive.

I probably looked a little suspicious for a week, snuggling up with my dad in front of the tv, telling my twin sister how much I love her, petting my dog for hours just to memorize how her fur feels, and spending time with the girl I fancy getting to *really* know her. I was internally freaking out, thinking what I would do if I had just a handful of days left, and wondering why I wasn't doing those things *right this fucking minute*

Yep - I fell off an inflatable raft in the deep end of a pool at a friends birthday party. The parents that were there knew I couldn't swim but I think they thought that maybe I could at least doggy paddle or something. I went straight to the bottom of the pool and remember looking up and inhaling water and all of a sudden my chest felt like it was on fire and then I blacked out. I woke up next to the pool on the patio where one of the dad's had given me CPR (he didn't actually know how but had just seen it in movies and I guess it worked well enough to get me to cough up the water and get air going again).

When I completely came to I had a massive headache. All the other kids were inside eating birthday cake and ice cream so I started to head inside when I slipped on the wet patio, smacked the back of my head on the concrete, split my head open and knocked myself back out. When I woke up my mom was there and was like ""ok, you're done with pool parties."""

"Many years ago, two friends and I stole 2 headstones from a weed-strewn country cemetery. We were 17, drunk and we wanted some props for the spook house we set up in an abandoned farmhouse. Nobody had been buried there in 50 years, so we didn't think anyone would notice. 

10 years later, I remembered the tombstones and started feeling guilty. I called the other two and we all met back at our hometown. We dug through the debris of the old farmhouse and found the 2 headstones. We returned them to the cemetery and tried to remember where they belonged. We put $500 each in an envelope and mailed it to the maintainer of the cemetery, telling what we had done and how bad we felt.

A few years later, I drove past that cemetery and looked around. The headstones had been put back where they belonged and had been cemented in place. The signboard by the entrance had a note saying ""Thanks to an anonymous donation, we have a new riding mower to keep the cemetery clean"". I still feel shitty about what we did, but I'd like to think our atonement helped someone who cared about the place.

"My office has several departments, each having their own supervisor.  A new supervisor was hired from outside of the company to manage a certain department and it quickly became a shit show.  She tried walking around with a box and demanding people put their cellphones in it, and they could have them back during lunch or at the end of the day.  Everyone refused.  

In an effort to show cost savings she started ordering the shittiest plastic utensils for the breakroom.  The knives and forks might as well been made out of al dente pasta for all the good it did.  She quickly became the memo queen and soon every part of the break room was wallpapered in her asinine missives.    

She tried to impose a two cup limit on break room coffee.  That's right, you read that sentence correctly.

She'd play favorites and give special treatment to certain individuals and before long that department resembled a gulag era of commissar employees snitching on other employees so they could get the days off they needed.  

It got so bad that the turn around in that department became horrendous, no amount of ass kissing or bodies tossed under the bus by her could cover the fact that she was as toxic as they come.  She was quietly moved to a non-management role in a completely different department.  

All she had to do was order office supplies and deal with vacation and sick time requests for payroll.  Before she came in her department was like a group of seasoned NCOs that needed little or no guidance.  By the time she left it was a smoking ruin.   

  Edit:  this kinda blew up in comments.  

1).  I was not in her department, I had my own boss who is amazing and did whatever they could to assuage her bullshit and spotlight it with the higher ups.  Some businesses have multiple offices and while she was overseeing the grunts, she had no sway over the other departments.

2).  There was always a bottomless office coffee pot.  It's in a field that demands folks be alert and well caffeinated.  In this case it's not so much a luxury but a necessity.

3).  The breaking point or line in the sand is when she played power games with me.  She scheduled a meeting for her department and told me mine needed to attend.  I told her we have our own weekly webcam meetings in my department and I didn't see the point, her response was the CEO personally requested I attend.  I saw the CEO the next week and asked them why this seemed necessary as it doesn't apply to me or my peers in my department and the CEO gave me a bewildered look and stated that no such request had ever been made nor implied.  So at that point she was lying and obviously to me full of shit.  No longer just petty but something more insidious.  

4).  Why wasn't she fired?  I think they just put her in the shark pool with the other predators and see if she flounders. 

6).  Cellphone etiquette should be maintained but people have kids and elderly loved once that may need to get ahold of them in real time.  Taking that away without setting in place another contact alternative is just s dick move."

"""Which place makes a better cheesesteak? Pats or Genos?""

EDIT: Well this blew up. Since so many people keep asking and there seems to be a debate, I'll give my two cents. There comes a point in a cheesesteak place's lifespan where they get really really popular, and that's great for them and great for the local economy to attract hordes of tourists. But when they get to that point, they tend to sacrifice quality for speed. So instead of high quality sirloin and real cheese, it becomes cheap meat and fake cheese; with the goal being to make as many cheesesteaks as fast as possible. So it's my humble opinion that any food truck, neighborhood pizza jawn or corner store can make a better cheesesteak than any of the major chains or tourist spots because they don't have to make 5000 cheesesteaks a day and can focus on making quality sandwiches. 

EDIT 2.  Yes ribeye is the best possible meat to use cause of its fat content, but due to the price, most places use sirloin or skirt steak. "

"Right, so. My boyfriend is a pretty good cook and over the years there isn't really anything that I've been able to cook better than him (I try!). He decided last spring that he really wanted to make all these different kinds of cake and they were all gorgeous apart from the red velvet one which he just couldn't seem to master. It was too soft and sunk a bit.

I wanted to give it a try as well, so I bought all the ingredients and found a new recipe but my cake was still just as bad. I was pretty annoyed that I wasn't able to make it properly as before I met him I was really good at making cakes.

So... I kinda went out and bought a pre made Betty Crocker red velvet cake mix and made the most delicious cake ever from it and may have lied and said I made it from scratch! To this day I haven't told him and every time I say I'm going to make it I have to time it so he is out at work and take the Betty Crocker packaging to a bin far away from the house so he won't be suspicious.

I am so ashamed but the feeling of triumphant cake making couldn't be any better!

Worst part was his son asked me for the recipe a few weeks ago so he could try it in his cooking class at school for the end of the year and I had to make something up about how it was a secret recipe and its the only thing I could cook better than his dad when in reality it's all a damn packet mix *shame shame shame*"

"The police pulled up behind us, lights flashing. We were in high school and had a scant few places to do it, so we got it on during a rainstorm in my family's Jeep, parked in a large field with a house in the center. Apparently, the owners of the house thought we were robbing them or casing their house and called the cops. One of the funniest lines of our relationship came from that night: ""Shit, coggro, it's the cops! Gimme my pants!"" They found me in the passenger seat and her in the back - driver's seat empty. They opened the door to check on her (mondo against the law, whatever, its fine now), and she had to tell them three times that she was fine. They let us go when we insisted we had just pulled in to watch the storm and obviously were way having some harmless, consensual, somewhat misguided sex.

"I made out with my sister.

Long story so bear with me while I get it out. Basically I grew up with my Aunt &amp; Uncle because my Mom died shortly after I was born and my Dad couldn't take it and left. Pretty fucked up childhood really but I made the best of it. Did my chores, had friends etc. I had plans to enlist in the military when I was 18 to get  school paid for, but most importantly make a living for myself and my aunt &amp; uncle. Before I could do that, however, my sister got in trouble with the government and I decided to postpone my application to go bail her out. I got a ride with my buddy to where she was being kept, and it turns out she was being held by some pretty corrupt people and, as it turns out, my Dad was basically in charge of them, and he's still as big of a dick as ever, so we got her the hell out of there. Unfortunately, while this was all happening, my aunt &amp; uncle were killed in a pretty horrible accident, so it was basically just me and my sis. The important thing to know is that I had only reconnected with my sister recently (she grew up in a foster home). Not growing up super close, and her being pretty hot, from that point we basically had this kind of awkward chemistry between us that regular siblings shouldn't have. This is where things get (more) complicated, though, because my buddy also had a thing for her as well. So like a good wingman I just pushed down my feelings and let him have a go.  Now, she ended up rejecting him though and when we were at a party one night she came at me pretty hard. We started making out but we couldn't get much farther because the Empire was building another Death Star and we had to go blow it up."

"Not my family, a friend's. When I was 13 my best friend and I were at his sister's condo. We had to babysit his niece who was 5. We went to the complex pool and did normal kid stuff. The niece had water wings on and we were doing general pool grab ass stuff like jumping in, trying to flip, etc. 

The girl at some point had slipped out of her water wings. I looked over and saw an image that will be with me until I die. Two yellow water wings floating on the water, and the girl 2-3 feet down, motionless, arms and legs hanging effortlessly, blond hair spread out. 

My friend just screamed and froze. I had jumped in the pool to swim to her but don't remember deciding to do it, I was just moving. I came up under her and pushed her up. I had no thought, plan or clue, just did. I pushed her out of the water and the force of my hand on her stomach pushed water out of her lungs. I got her to the side and my friend pulled her out. She coughed and started crying. 

My friend was afraid he'd get in trouble so we never spoke of it. The girl was too young and didn't say or recall.

Now she's in her early 40s with two kids. Nobody knows it happened.

"My son's school does something like this - they give out tickets throughout the year, then have kids bring in something to sell for tickets and hold a little mini-market for all the children to set up ticket shops. My son couldn't think of a good idea, so I said ""Why not Buy/Sell Tickets for RL Money?""

We set up our booth, we were buying tickets from kids for a nickel, and selling tickets to kids for a dime.

Walked out of there with the original $20 in nickels I had provided, plus about another $5 in dimes which my son kept, and my son had so many tickets left over that he was able to buy a bunch of stuff from other kids stations, including candy and games.

His teacher and principal were upset because they had complaints from parents because they felt like we were ""Ripping off their children"". I told his principal that since the purpose of this activity was to teach the kids how economy works, what better way to teach my son this than to show him how companies make profit?

They told me we weren't allowed to do that again, so next year we'll be setting up a pyramid scheme for tickets.

"I was hiking through the remnants of a remote, long-abandoned town and the surrounding area. To get to as far into the woods as I was, you had to cross fallen trees over a creek three times. I had just crossed the third ""bridge"" and was about five miles in and something blue caught my eye just ahead of me. 

There was a man, in his sixties at least, wearing blue satin pajamas, sitting in a tree. The closer I got to him the louder he laughed; it wasn't a maniacal laugh, but it set off all the alarms in my head nevertheless. He also wasn't wearing any shoes and looked well-groomed/cleaned. 

I gave him a friendly nod as I passed and he just kept laughing. Then it stopped. I turned and he was gone. There was no branch cracking, plants rustling, nothing... He was just gone. 

Still rubs me the wrong way. The area I was in was a pretty rough hike, very secluded. Not very many people venture as deep as I was that day. No idea what was going on there. "

"This wasn't me, and it isn't NSFW but I think it's worth sharing.

One driver told me that one time this guy got in his uber without putting in the destination. This guy was in his mid 40s, wearing an all black suit and wearing sunglasses. Didn't take them off. He also had a briefcase that he put on his lap.

Anyway so he sits in the car and points forwards. So the driver takes off. They didn't speak the entire journey. It was about 40 minutes. To tell the driver where to go the passenger just pointed left or right. 

Anyway, the driver tells me that he was shitting himself the entire time and genuinely thought he was going to die, but was too scared to stop. 

So finally they pull over at this really big old house that he described as ""the most mafia looking house I've ever fucking seen"". 

The guy takes off his glasses, looks at the driver and says ""th- th- th- thank y- you v- very m- m- much""

"This one isn't really NSFW but it's the reason why I stopped working for Uber. 

It's about 10:30pm. I get a request and accept it. It's a 20something year old girl just getting off work at a retail clothing store. She needs a ride to her home, about 35 minutes outside the city limits. Cool, long ride = more money. Get to her house, she gets out and I drive away. Now, I'm about 25+ miles away from the city so I don't really expect to get any hits out there. I'm about to head back in when I get another request. This one is another 30 minutes further outside the city limits. Hmm...maybe this person wants to go downtown. That's an hour long ride = $$$. I'm down. Start heading their way. It's a beautiful night so I cruise the whole way with my windows down. 

Long, winding, narrow roads. No street lights for miles. Finally I come across the property. It's a ranch-style place. I turn in. Still no lights. Pitch black. I drive in for about two miles with no signs of a house. I'm doubting my GPS at this point. Oh well, I'm already this far. Keep going. 

Oh cool, a house! No lights on. Something doesn't seem right. I swing my car around to face the exit, leave my car in drive and rest my foot on the brake, just in case, and waited for a while. Nothing. Let me give the guy a call. 

He answers. Sounds confused. 

""Hey, I'm your Uber driver, I'm outside. Take your time, I'm here whenever you're ready."" 

""Uber? I didn't request a ride.""

""Hmm? I'm at ###XXXXX, Texas. Your address and information comes up on my app.""

""Texas? I'm in Indiana. I've never been to Texas. Please don't charge me."" Hangs up. 

In that moment, I felt the already pitch black night get darker. I turn down the radio. My window was still open and so I started listening. 

You know that sound of a dirt road when somebody is walking on it? How it crunches and you can hear every step? Imagine that sound, but there are two sets of feet. And they're running. Getting louder. I look out my rear view mirror and the only light is from the red parking lights of my car. 

Two men. All black clothes painted red by my brake lights. Sprinting. Getting closer. Getting louder. 

I slammed on the gas, my car threw pebbles and rocks at them as I semi-burned out and I hauled ass as fast as I could out of that property. Got back on that winding road, followed it all the way to a well-lit gas station, shifted to park, and sat there, stunned. What just happened? 

I tried following up with Uber. Nothing really came of it. To this day I'll always have to wonder what happened that night. "

"*Dude I also went to school with a crazy fucker named Cole. He left the school once during recess for no fucking reason, went to the bank, withdrew $15 somehow, and then walked across the street to the Taco Bell. Whole school was looking for him, police were searching too. He just comes back like he didn't do anything wrong and ate his Taco Bell alone in the band room until he was found. 

He also bashed his head against the bathroom mirror and shattered it because he ""wanted to see if he could do it.""

Edit: Just confirming and adding some detail. This was sixth or seventh grade if I remember right. How (or if) he actually get money from the bank we have no fucking clue. ATM card seems like a good choice until we realize he said he withdrew $15, as most people have noted they only dispense in $20s or sometimes rarely $10. He could've also been lying, but the police did confirm with the bank tellers that he was there. They didn't think much of it. I do remember he was in the remedial math classes so maybe he actually got $20, or maybe he had $5 already but just got $10. Fucking Cole... we'll never know. 


Edit 2.0 - More Cole stories:


- Again, sixth or seventh grade. We walked into our music class and for some reason the curtains on one of the windows had fallen to the ground. He actually tries to do something nice, so he picks them up and tries putting them back on. Mrs. E, our teacher, walks in and the first thing she sees is Cole screwing with the curtains. Mrs. E wasn't a nice lady. She screams, ""COLE WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY BLINDS?"" He looked like a deer in headlights. ""They're curtains. And they were on the ground so I'm fixing them?"" Again irate she yells at Cole, thinking he caused a problem. ""Dammit! These belonged to my mother, Cole!"" One kid in the class goes, ""Ooooooh, you said a bad word. I'm teeeelling, I'm gonna go to the principle's office"", and runs off down the hall to get the principle. We tried telling her that they really were like that when we got there, and he was trying to help. But she wasn't having it. Cole says, ""Well fuck you too then"", and drops the curtains back on the floor and sits down LOL. Mrs. E left the building, smoked a cigarette outside, came back, got her purse, and left. Never saw her again. 


- Cole was in ""time-out"", one teacher had enough of his shit and literally dragged him and his desk to the other side of the room and put tape around him on the floor, forming a square. She told him not to go anywhere, not to make noise, and not to leave his tape. Cole kept slyly sticking his foot outside of the tape and going, ""BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP! ALERT! ALERT!"" She'd tell him to shut up and he'd comply for six minutes until he left his designated zone and activated the Cole alarm, whence he would again start making beeping siren noises. 


- We had a class report on Tom Sawyer &amp; Huck Finn. I happened to be paired with Cole, and we had another group member with us too. We got up to do our short five minute presentation about whatever theme or whatever we were assigned relating to the book, and Cole probably said, ""Fuckleberry Finn"" at least eight times in front of the entire class. He went out of his way to say it as much as he could. The teacher was infuriated, red in the face, but she knew that she would just have to take a loss on this one. 

Edit v2.5: I've had ~~three~~ six PMs so far asking me for more Cole stories. Another user mentioned creating a subreddit dedicated to the fucked up Coles of this world, I may do that later.

"That people are more decent and more resilient that I had previously thought

That suffering is part of the human condition, and it is not unusual for people to experience depression or anxiety problems at some point in their life

That someone’s distress about their problem doesn’t necessarily correlate with how big that problem objectively looks to others 

That in order to benefit from therapy people need to have the humility and curiosity to try something different, to try thinking and behaving differently 

That it can be frustrating when someone just uses therapy to talk about themselves but doesn’t make changes in their life, even though they’ve identified that their behavior is dysfunctional and is making others unjustifiably unhappy

That even though this work often makes me crave time away from people, it’s rare to come across a patient I don’t like – everybody has something likeable that makes me feel tender towards them, even if they don’t realise it (and it’s often a quality they’re not particularly aware of)

That if I give my all to every patient, they will probably benefit from feeling that I am totally present, passionate about helping them, and that I understand them and I like them. But if I do all of that for every patient I've nothing left over for me and my loved ones, so I've learned not to. It's an uneasy compromise but it's the only way I can find balance

That life is not fair. 

Edit: Writing this post yesterday felt cathartic. But I was nervous that in admitting I don’t always give my all to every patient, I would get a negative reaction. 

I was shocked to read peoples’ kind responses. I’m new to Reddit so I don’t quite know the protocol but I wanted to say thanks to the people who took time to write something kind to this stranger, it recharged my batteries today.

"Yes, my mom and dad would go ape if someone had a snack or something. We were teen boys and it's FOOD! Geez. My parents would get angry if we had a friend over and they were hungry or thirsty. ""Why can't they eat at their own house?!"" was common. My instruction to my kids friends is, ""If I let you in the door, then you're part of the family. Here's the fridge, here's where the glasses, plates, etc, are. If you're hungry, don't wait to be asked, it's just food, eat it. But as a member of the family you're also expected to clean up after yourself, too. Lol, they always told my kids I was the coolest dad. I'd hate anyone to feel what I felt growing up in my own house. They all still keep in touch via Facebook, etc. :)

"My cousin was a Grab Taxi driver, basically an Asian version of Uber. So in Thailand we have a tv show called Hormones which is like Degrassi or Secret Life Of An American Teenager and they had a scene where kids where having sex in the backseat of a taxi. Apparently these kids wanted to try it out just like in the show (they were white btw so he found it funny that they would try it) and started making out and taking off items of clothing. My cousin said he stopped looking once they started takin em off, but he overheard the girl getting frustrated that the guy couldn't get hard so she put on her clothes and left the car furiously. Then the guy asked him to take him home lol

edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sv0fO0tbw8 i mean if ya skip to 5:30 it's the show inside this show where two kids start making out eventually leading to sex and then 1:11:05 is where the students do it cause of the show lol (just so y'all get what i mean)"
Desperately searching for their wedding ring?

"There's a highly publicised case in the UK at the moment of a young child (11 months) who has an incredibly rare and devastating mitochondrial condition which has left him unable to breath without a ventilator, blind, brain damaged and with an epilepsy disorder. His parents raised over £1 million through crowdfunding to take him to US for experimental treatment that has never been given to someone with his strain of the disorder. The hospital in which he is being cared for is an extremely famous and innovative children's hospital, has said that they will not facilitate his transfer to the US (he needs to be on a ventilator at all times). The boy's parents have taken this case all the way the European Court of Human Rights, however it has been ruled that the boy is to be taken off the ventilator and ""die with dignity"". It's an incredibly sad case of two parents who are willing to do anything to possibly save their child, and the hospital has become the ""evil"", while trying to safeguard the child's best interests. The poor child has no quality of life yet his parents insist on keeping him alive at any cost. 
I just hope that the poor child is able to find peace. 

Edit: Something I thought I'd add in as it's quite important. The American doctor who initially offered to treat the child with the experimental treatment later stated that he did not realise how unwell the child was and now does not believe he'll benefit from it. I should have added that to the original comment. "

"We had lived together for about 4 months, after dating for about a year. Things were going pretty OK, until one day I got called into work super early, so I got home somewhat early. When I arrived home, she was also at home. Perplexed, I entered my apartment to find her watching TV, instead of being at work. When I inquired about the situation, she let me know that she asked her boss to cut her back to just three part time shifts a week, from her five full time shifts she was working. Even more perplexed, I asked for her reasons for cutting her hours. Her explanation was that 15 hours a week paid her bills, so she simply did not need to work more. When I told her that the rent, utilities, groceries and other regular bills still had to be paid, she said I could just work more to cover the community bills. Now, I worked in the oil fields at the time, and was already pulling 12 to 14 hour days every day, and I worked 11 days between days off, so there was no way in hell I was going work on my days off just because she didn't want to work. No matter how much we talked about it, she refused to work a full time job. The warning bells started ringing, and I got the feeling this was just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

We broke up two weeks later.

Dear lord
"Former 68W with 3 combat tours, I might be able to explain this for you. During Saddam's reign him and his friends were crazy wealthy. Like richer than God wealthy. Often times they'd be so wealthy they'd start running out of expensive shit to buy. Seems like once they had the big houses and fancy cars they'd just buy crazy shit like gold toilets (seen it), gold guns (also seen it) and even sometimes large animals of prey (vultures, falcons, tigers etc). 

The thing is, when Saddam fell, so did a lot of his friends. I've heard stories of the house staff of a lot of these people not wanting the animals to be killed when looters ransacked the estates of the uber wealthy. Instead they'd release the animals. I guess they thought the animals had a better chance of survival on their own.  

That's what we were told by our 1st Sergeant(he could've been fuckin w us) Still crazy.

"Replacing my home AC system was like that.  $18k for the Best, $9k for Better, $7k for Good.  Turns out if I went with different equipment (same company, same size equipment, just different brand, with the same 10 year parts and labor warranty) and negotiated a little it would have been $5.5k.

Edit #1: Since this blew up: the psychological process is called 'Anchoring'.  The $18k number is intended to inflate my general perception of what this job should cost.  The 3 tiers are made to influence my decision to choose the 'middle tier', which now appears to be a good value overall.  The lack of presentation of a real budget option #4, which existed in reality, gives them room to negotiate price without negotiating profit.  This is all deliberate, intelligent, and understandable.  They are a business not a charity.  You just have to see what they are doing and accept it or fight back.

Edit #2: Everyone that says their cousin could have done it for $20 didn't take into account the 10 year labor warranty, which does cost money although it is also presented as free, or the fact that your cousin is a crackhead.

"Not exactly NSFW, but still a crazy experience that happened to my brother.

He is a Lyft driver, and one day he was picking up an OR nurse from work and taking her home. She lived kind of far away so they needed to take the freeway to get to it. They start shooting the shit, and my brother starts talking about how when he was a baby he had open-heart surgery at the same hospital that she works in. Funny enough, this nurse has been in the OR during many open-heart surgeries, so she knows a lot about them. She starts talking about them, and eventually goes into pretty graphic detail about how the surgery is done.

Now, my brother has this problem where he passes out very easy while discussing or seeing medical procedures. He's done it three times before; once where he watched himself get an IV, once from seeing the pin in his toe after he had foot surgery, and once while they were discussing how to put a catheter in during EMT training (he wanted to be a firefighter).

So sure as shit, after a little bit of hearing about the surgery, the nurse notices the car veering off to the left, crossing over a lane. She looks over at my brother and sees him passed out cold behind the wheel. She starts screaming and the car ends up veering off into a ditch on the side of the freeway. The nurse, apparently forgets all her training, and just fucking books it once the car stops. Apparently the smell coming from the deployed airbags smelled like smoke to her and she thought the car was going to blow up. My brother and the nurse were both physically fine, but his car is completely totaled.

TL;DR: My brother is a Lyft driver and he passed out while driving with a customer on the freeway.

"August 27, 1995 the prisoners of Vridsløselille State Penitentiary in Denmark were allowed into the yard for a barbecue, when a 30 ton Caterpillar 980C wheel loader rammed through the prison wall and created [a huge hole where the wall once stood](http://www.dansk-politi.dk/media/1098/politihistorie1-bulldozerpolfoto_672440.jpg?mode=pad&amp;width=870). (photo)

[13 dangerous prisoners scaled the rubble and ran to freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC1RPMQ9DZk) (Video).

Soon after my dad got a call on the phone and told us to turn on the television.  
Why? - It was our wheel loader that had been stolen from our family company (a gravel pit) and been used for what is to this date still Denmarks most spectacular prison break.

I remember my dad swearing and cursing (like many dads he can have quite a temper) and being very upset about 3 things.  

1. Some bastard had stolen our wheel loader and rammed it into a fucking wall and caused major damage to it!
2. That bastard had also rammed through our company gate, completely trashing it. (Which BTW was totally unnecessary because the dirt barriers that surround the gravel pit keep cars and trucks from passing them, but a wheel loader can easily scale those, so the thief could just have driven around the gate and over the barrier)   
3. As we could now see on live television the police was now driving the wheel loader and using it to clean up the scene - potentially causing further damage to it's damaged hydraulics.

In the months after the prison break, people at my college and elsewhere kept asking me mainly two questions :  
*Could I drive that thing?* - Yes.  
*Did I drive that thing* - No!

The prisoners were all caught again after only a couple of weeks and the mastermind behind it, a notorious breakout king, only lasted 6 days outside the walls before he was caught again. He has since then escaped that same prison 3 further times in different ways and has broken out of prison 22 times in total.

As the door opens I am confronted with the friendly face of my old father, we make eye contact. There is no pride or fatherly love in this moment.

"Once when I was trekking through rural Finland alone (a stroll from the campsite), I decided to stop at a lakeside. 

I sat down by the lake in the moonlight, surrounded by trees and felt very calm for a while. Splashed water on my face and generally refreshed myself.

Then after spending some time looking at the water I looked up and across the lake I saw a really tall figure, half as tall as the trees. It was really skinny and I'm pretty sure it looked like it had antlers or horns and really long fingers, don't think it looked at me. I don't know if I was sleep deprived or something, but I remember I froze for a moment before running back to camp.

The same friend almost got kicked out of school for shitting on the bra of a girl from our dorm (the details are not terribly important).  He had a student affairs trial and had to testify about pooping on the bra in front of all these university higher-ups and what he learned from it.  A lot of the people on our floor went in support to testify, essentially saying, ""Sure he shat on that bra, but he's a good guy.""

The 'close' is the point at which they seal the deal, and you give them your money in exchange for whatever they have convinced you that you need.

There are five basic ways that salesmen will 'impulse' you. The acronym they taught us was G.I.F.T.S.

The first was 'Greed'. People are naturally greedy. By which I mean they want more for their money. They want a good deal. If people think they can make or save money, they are more inclined to buy. An example of this is basic 'half price' or 'buy X, get Y free' sales.

I stands for 'Indifference'. People can smell desperation. If they sense that you have a motive for wanting them to do something (like buy) they will be more wary, and want to know your reasons. Therefore, a salesman will try to make it seem as though they do not care whether or not you buy (even if they are on commission). After all, they are only offering you this amazing deal for your own benefit.. They have nothing to gain..

Third was 'Fear of Loss'. Causing people to worry that they will miss out if they don't buy. This can be exploited by making people think that this is their one and only opportunity to purchase at a 'reduced rate', or used in conjunction with 'Greed', for example 'buy in the next 60 minutes and get X free!'.

T, 'The Jones' Theory'. If your community is getting on-board with an idea, there is no reason that you shouldn't too. It's safe. 'It's all the rage'. 'Everybody's doing it'. 'Don't miss out'. This also ties in with 'Fear of Loss'.

The last one is 'Sense of Urgency'. Can be used in similar ways as 'Fear of Loss', i.e. 'buy in the next 60 minutes or else X', or as subtly as a salesman saying that they have other appointments and won't be able to come back and offer you this deal for a too-long period of time. A sense of urgency causes people to buy more impulsively, especially when coupled with a fear of loss.

Once salesmen have 'impulsed' you enough, they will try to 'close' you. I was also taught a number techniques to 'close'.

The first was the 'assumptive close'. This is basically assuming that the person will buy and filling out the paperwork. A common example of this is a salesman simply asking for your your name, and the proceeding with the sale. They will fill out an entire form and then just ask you to sign at the end.

This is often assisted by the 'trial close', where a salesman will slowly push you over the line, while at the same time testing you to see if you are 'impulsed' enough to buy. They will do this by asking you closed questions, aimed at steering you down a conversational track which leads to a sale. Charity workers do this a lot when they ask 'Do you like dolphins?' (yes), 'Do you think dolphin's habitats should be protected?' (yes), 'How much do you spend on beer / tea / coffee a week?' ($5-$50), 'Do think you could put $X towards saving the dolphins?' (umm, well, I guess you got me there..)

Another powerful close is the 'alternative close', where salesmen will offer you one of two choices, both of which result in a sale. 'So would you like the regular option or the slique-deluxe?'. Often presented assumptively (see 'assumptive close').

The last was the 'silent close'. Harder to use, but effective with indecisive buyers or people that pull back when pressured. Basically presenting the overwhelming positives with the easily countered negatives, and then shifting control of the conversation to the buyer, and forcing them to say 'yes' or 'no'. Obviously, the salesman has presented the information in such a way that you would be stupid to say 'no'. After building tension and excitement for the product, they let you come to the decision themselves.

Almost every person who sells goods or services has been taught something along these lines, and the most successful salesmen have this information at the forefront of their minds when they are selling to you. Never forget it. These people just want your money, they honestly do not generally care what you get out of it.

"Seeing someone get hit by a car.  

I was maybe around 10 or so and I was being driven to the doctors office for a check-up when we stopped at a stop light. There was a guy crossing the street to my left who looked down the road and started running across the crosswalk. Next thing I knew a car drove through the light and slammed into him launching him straight in the air whereby he landed on the ground with a loud thud. Looking at him there was no movement whatsoever; he was just lying there inert on the road. Luckily we were just down the road from a hospital and there was a cop right across the street. We drove off from the scene with the woman who hit him in absolute hysterics.

The thing that sticks with me the most is the sound of the car hitting him and the ""oomph!"" he made when it hit."
"I used to be a live- in nanny for the CEO of a major German investment bank in Berlin. They were a lovely couple with a sweet baby girl, and they made me feel like part of the family from day 1. They paid me well, had a separate car for me and weren't concerned by what I did in my spare time. They were very generous, lovely people. 

My only gripe is that they had strange eating habits- some days they would have three enormous meals, and other days they would 'forget' to eat all day. I was often too shy to say that i was hungry 😕"

It works when used well.

"I know my ""uncle"" Joe is a rapist. Joe is a close family friend. He's been around my whole life. When I was a teenager, I walked in on my uncle during a Christmas party  having sex with a girl I'll call Carmen, who was a couple of years older than me. I presumed it was sex because the noises were right and Carmen had a rep for being wild and preferring older men. Joe was married. I just thought he was being a dick. 

In the 1980s, there was a bunch of unreported rapes in our town. It was an open secret. One night, when I was about 8,  I accidentally overheard a very drunk Joe confessing to being the guy who did it. My father dismissed him, told he was a liar.

I went away for a couple of months and came back. Someone told me Carmen was accusing Joe of rape. She was drugged and by the time she realized there'd been a rape, there wasn't any physical evidence left. Joe denied having sex with her. She'd went to the cops. Nothing had been done but the rumours got out.

So I went to the police and gave a statement about that night and what I heard. Joe was questioned but it didn't go anywhere. My father wouldn't forgive me if he knew.

"For those who were curious:  

The minimum he overpaid is assuming the 16 yo just turned 16 when the agreement begins while the 13 yo is exactly 13 and the 8 yo is 8 and 11 mo.  So after two years of paying what he had to ($2k/mo) we have a 15 year old. He is now paying $600/mo more than he needs to for 36 months (36\*$600 = $21,600). 5 years later the last child is 13 and 11 months. So 4 years  and 1 month of paying $1300 more per month is (49*$1300) = $63,700. For a grand total of $85,300 more than necessary.  

The maximum he overpaid is assuming the 16 yo is 16 and 11 mo and the others are exactly 13 and 11 mo and 8. After 13 months of paying the appropriate $2k/mo we have a 15 yo child and a 9 and 1 mo child. So he overpays $600/mo for 3 years ($21,600). Then the remaining 5 years and 11 mo he overpays by $1300/mo ($92,300) for a total of $113,900 overpaid. 

So this man overpaid between $85.3k and $113.9k over 10 years (really 7-8 years since for 13-24 months he was paying appropriately).

"When I was maybe 14 I lived in a rural area of the BC interior. As young teens do, I got bored easily in my small town. To alleviate my boredom, my friends and I would routinely explore the surrounding areas, and go on long day hikes.

There are two instances I can remember being very creeped out on our expeditions. The first time was in the summer; my two friends and I decided to do a hike across several dozen kms. We of course prepared adequately, as any group of 14 year olds would. We had water, and a bag of jerky between the three of us. Naturally, we got very hungry as the jerky quickly ran out. To combat this, we decided to cut through the back roads, and farm land so we could get to the highway faster, and thusly to food. After about an hour of hungry hiking we came upon a little village that was all gated up, and surrounded by brambles. This itself isn't too creepy. What was creepy was the fact that just inside the gate was a /mountain/ of cattle skeletons and corpses. There seriously would've had to have been 3 dozen bodies in the pile. As kids, we were sufficiently spooked. As an adult, I think a logical reason for a death mountain may have been that the herd was diseased and this was a way to quarantine.

The second time was with the same friends, but we were a few years older. On this adventure, we decided to walk the railroad tracks and gather old rail spikes so we could sell them to the scrapper. After a few grueling hours of hiking and carrying increasingly heavy backpacks, we happened upon a house. It was very secluded, but from outside it didn't look abandoned. Curiosity, and fatigue got the better of us. We dropped our bags and went exploring. We initially just wanted some water, but we found the front door wide open. Outside, there was lots of construction machinery, So we thought maybe they were doing some finishing work inside. We called out, but received no reply. So, with recklessness, we decided to effectively break and enter. This place turned out to be a dump. It looked like a crack house. Old garbage and food everywhere. We assumed no one lived there after all. So what do we do? We decide to snoop around. As we were poking around the ground floor, we heard what sounded like footsteps on the second floor. We called out, but no answer was given. My one friend decided to be brave and go up and check. As he got to the stairs, he called out again; nothing. So he starts up the stairs. I shit you not, as his foot hit the first tread, we heard a music box go off. Alright, kind of creepy, but then we heard a kid's giggle from above. We noped out of there pretty quickly and ran home. We even forgot our backpacks!

"I moved out at 15 and lived near Muskegon, Michigan.  Tried to avoid it, but that's where possible jobs and rides were so I went there to better myself. Was homeless for about a year and just couch surfed, stayed with random people or just slept in abandoned buildings or parks. Scariest part was knowing that once the sun started going down, I HAD to lay low and find a place to crash for the night. Walking the streets of Muskegon after dark is fucking awful. Especially when you're  young. People tried to rob me, take advantage of me, sell me drugs (which I took) then follow my whereabouts, chase me just for fun. It was awful.

Thus really only works if you're a valued employee though. Most employees even the good ones are replaceable. Restaurants are revolving doors.

"Alright so I was in Safekey (afterschool thing in the US) and i was about nine. So we are watching Spy kids and I'm kind of jsut zoning out but I started to just get lost in thought about the whole situation of the main bad guy. He's just trying to be a kid in the movie. He's making toys out of all the things that threaten him. I just felt he was a lonely misunderstood guy the whole time. That was not what gave me an existential crisis though. It was ore just what made me start deep-thinking. So the movie ends and we all go out to play recess and as a kids do you play a game off the movie you just watched. So everyone is getting their roles and this one kid was giving them out. He was gonna be the little boy and made me a thumb person and a bunch of people floops. I kind of just sat on the play ground and watched them all chase each other around. I was thinking about how we all got our place from this kid and he had no authority and that no one here really had an authority over us as human beings. (quick note that our staff at the time was kind of abusive. once a guy made me and my friends run until we almost passed out  because we fell on the playground equipment and them cursing at us, etc.) I started to realize they were all the bad guy from the movie. They were making other people around them toys. They were trying to do it with good intentions as the bad guy as well, but in the end they ended up using people without their agreement. I was kind of just thinking about all that and then about how the kids in the movie are just kids doing something this agency of adults should be doing. It made me think of how generations leave the kids with a bunch of their shit for them to pick up. Also their was the sheer terror I felt because now i was thinking maybe we are all floops and we don't know it or how we are just being manipulated in some way or another by some bad guy. That movie just fucked me up dude. Not to mention the thumb people scared the shit out of me."

"Posted this last time this thread was up.

I'm late to the party. But here's my story. Uber driver. Craziest, arguably most sad situation I've been part of. I haven't driven for uber since.

On this particular night, I received a peculiar request for a ride. The request came in, and everything seemed normal. He was 3 miles away, according to his request.

As I’m driving to the pick up location, I get a phone call. It’s my passenger. Basically he says…

“Hey man, I’m not actually at that location. I just had to put that so someone could come get me. I’m too far away from any other drivers, so the app made me put my location in your city, closer to other drivers. Come pick me up at my drop off location.”

This is okay with me, because I am getting paid to go pick him up. To my surprise, he lives over an hour away. Score, this is about to be easy money.

About an hour and a half passes, and I roll up to a small little house in a decent area. I text my passenger.

“Hey man, this is your driver. I’m outside!”

“Cool, I’ll be out in a second.”

Out walks a guy, 23 years old. Really handsome guy, he could have been a model. Thick brown hair, scruffy facial hair, nice smile, everything. Charismatic and outgoing as well. 

He has an open bottle of liquor in one hand, and sprite in the other as he walks to my car.

Knowing this is against the law, I’m hesitant to let him in my car. But, I drove over an hour to pick this guy up, so I wasn’t about to turn him away because of his drink.

He asks me if we can run into an ATM really quickly. I oblige, so get gets to the ATM. He gets $10 cash.

He gets back in the car, and takes a swig of his liquor, the bottle ¾ full at this point. I ask him where he wants me to take him tonight.

“Atlanta. It’s not a great part of town that we’re going in, but just trust me man, it’s all going to be okay. I promise.”

“I’m calm man, don’t worry about that.”

We hit the road. Atlanta is 2 hours away from where we are at this point.

It’s a long ride, so we begin talking. I learn a lot about him. 

-He’s drunk.

-He drinks every day, so his drunken state is actually incredibly coherent.

-He’s really smart. Former UGA student. Wanted to be a doctor.

-Dropped out of school.

-He’s now homeless.

-Addicted to drugs.

-Low self esteem, doesn’t know what to do with his life. He is a self proclaimed fuck up.

I find all of this to be interesting. I tend to be decent with people who are troubled in life, so I do what I can to try to talk to this kid. I want to help him.

I want to relate to him. To get through to him. He clearly has his hands full with life.

I ask him, “What’s your favorite thing in the world to do? Like, you have 24 hours to do this one thing. What do you do?”

“Heroin.”

“Okay, lets spin the wheel again. Not quite the answer I was looking for.”

“I like heroin man. Video games too. But mainly heroin.”

“Do you think you have a problem?”

“Not really. I’ve been to rehab twice before. But I’ve never done it for myself. I only went because other people made me,”

“I see.”

I get a feel for this guy. He continues drinking his bottle. I’m going to get arrested if I get pulled over with this guy drinking this bottle in my car.

Fuck it. Lets keep driving. I’ve come this far with him, why not.

“Pull over. I have to pee.”

“Bruh can you wait like 10 minutes? I’m not about to stop on the highway for you to pee. Let me get to a gas station.”

“Alright but hurry!”

We’re laughing at this point. He’s drunk but still coherent, and I’m driving 90 on the highway so this guy won’t pee in my car. Having a good time, enjoying each others company.

Right before I get to the gas station, he accidentally spills his sprite in my (new) car. 

This is where I began to see first hand his low self esteem. When he spilled his sprite, he started cursing himself. Talking about how he always fucks everything up. About how he can never do anything right. He makes things worse for everyone.

I assure him that he’s okay. I tell him I’ll clean it when we get to the gas station.

We arrive. I tell him to go to the bathroom. I clean the spilled drink. No harm no foul. No big deal.

When he comes out, I tell him everything is okay, and the car is as good as new. He’s still a little upset, but he gets over it.

Back on the road to Atlanta.

We talk politics, religion, and some other things. 

He passes out in my front seat from his liquor. He tells me to wake him up when we get to Atlanta.

“Alright brother, we’re here. Now where?”

This is where things get interesting. And I mean interesting.

He navigates me to a ghetto, run down, dark apartment. There are cops at every corner in this city, and I’m not exaggerating.

Just to give you an idea of how bad this part of town is, he tells me, “I’m going to run inside. I’ll be out in 3 minutes. PLEASE, do not leave me here. Please. I’m begging you. I know it’s scary here, but please don’t leave me in this part of town. After this, you can leave me wherever you want. But please don’t leave me here.”

I have no idea what we’re doing at this terrible place, but I’ve found myself here at 4:00 AM with this guy.

He gets out of my car, and runs to the third story of the apartment. 2 minutes goes by, and he’s right back out in my car.

“Alright man, we can go now.”

“What the hell was that about man?”

“I had to buy my drugs. Ready?”

“What’d you buy?”

“Heroin.” 

Fuck. I just drove this guy 2 hours to a crackhouse. I’m gonna fucking die tonight. I’m gonna die.

We pull out of the dark parking lot. I’m JUST back into the main street, and he tells me to pull over to the side of the road. I oblige.

He gets out, runs into the woods, and comes back with a bag. He grabbed his needles.

This kid is now sitting in my front seat with heroin. He takes off his shoe and sock. Ties his shoe laces around his ankle. He inserts the needle into his foot. This man is using heroin while I’m driving my car. At any second, he could stab me with this needle, drug me, and kill me. 

I am going to get fucking thrown in prison with this guy. I’m transporting drugs. Wow.

Fuck it. I’ve gone this far with this kid. I’m not backing out now. I’ve gotta do something. I’m gonna help this kid.

“How much did you just buy?”

“$10 worth. Why?”

“Listen man. You’ve got a problem. You just spent $175 in rides to get to Atlanta, for $10 worth of drugs. Do you see the problem here?”

He stays silent. The heroin kicks in almost immediately. He’s drowsy as hell, incoherent at this point, trying to stay awake. He injected more than he realized, and his heart is slowing. He assures me he’s not going to die.

“Yeah, uhhh, please don’t die. That’d be great if you didn’t die right now.”

He lets out a little laugh. He’s about to pass out, but he tells me to take him to a gas station. I take him to the one he requested. He gets out of my car, and stumbles into the woods at the gas station. I am watching his every move, seeing if he is going to rob this gas station, or whatever it is he is doing.

He starts digging in the ground. Like a dog who is making a hole. He’s digging for about 3 solid minutes, then he makes his way back to my car.

He found his crack that he had hid last week, when he thought the cops were following him.

He then buys vinegar at the gas station.

He then dilutes his crack rock in the vinegar, and starts shooting up crack into his foot in my car.

“Take me to the hospital. I need to go to rehab.”

“Seriously?”

“Yes. You’re right. I’m addicted. When you told me how much I spent on the ride to buy my drugs, that was a wakeup call.”

At this point, he’s on the verge of tears. 

And so am I. 

I take him to the hospital. On the way there, he starts crying.

“You’ve been a better friend to me than anyone I’ve ever known. Why? I don’t get it. There MUST be a reason that you were the one who was sent to pick me up tonight. It’s a sign. I don’t know who you are, but you’ve been a better friend to me tonight than I’ve ever had in my life. Why are you helping me? I’m a fuck up. You should have left me hours ago.”

I’m crying while driving this guy.

“I don’t know why I do these things man. I just care about you. I want you to get better.”

“Thanks. Nobody has ever cared.”

We get to rehab at the hospital.

I walk in to check this guy in.

He stays in the car.

I tell the receptionist whats going on.

“I’m an uber driver. There is a guy in my car right now who is strung out on crack and heroin. He needs to go to rehab.”

“Whoa, what’s going on? Let me come see whats going on.”

The receptionist follows me to my car. Along with the fucking police man, who was sitting next to him at the front desk.

The cop is a huge dick at this point. 

He tells my passenger to get out of my car and put his hands up.

After searching him, he tells him to gather his paraphernalia (needles and whatnot) and he takes him inside. Officer tells me to follow.

He is interrogating the kid, just relentlessly questioning him, and the kid is crying. He keeps saying, “I don’t want to go back to jail. I just want help. I don’t want to do this anymore.”

I step in and pretty much tell the officer to chill out, and quit intimidating the guy.

The officer then pulls me aside and threatens to arrest me.

He backs off the kid, and starts interrogating me. Telling me that I’m just as guilty as he is, and that I should be in prison right now.

During his interrogation with me, the passenger says that I know nothing. I’m just an uber driver.

After my passenger mentions that, the officer tells me to get the hell out of there.

I left.

Today, I have no idea what came of the situation. I don’t know if the kid got the help he needed. If he went to jail. If he went home. Nothing. I have no idea."

I am a Christian, in that what I believe, falls under that label. 

I have a daughter. I love her. And I genuinely want her to experience the type of existence where she feels love and happiness, especially and always from me. 

Odds are, she will not always want to live with me, though she will always be welcome. And she will not always choose to follow my advice, even though my advice will always come from a place of love and best intention. Though she may not always understand me, or even like me, I will always love her. Always.

I choose to believe that how I feel for my daughter is a smaller piece of a larger function known as Love. And my belief in God, and how I strive to live and treat others, follows the teachings and behaviors of Jesus. I am not knowledgeable enough, nor will I ever be qualified to tell other people whether they will go to Hell, or even if there is one.

But as a parent, I will tell you this. I choose to believe that, my child will always be welcome in my home. At times, she may need to wipe her feet before entering. She may need to resolve some personal issues and hold herself accountable for her actions, before she's decided the time is right for her to visit or that she can visit. But I also accept that she may make the choice to never visit. And that the greater existence, whatever that entails, must be able to accommodate that choice. Perhaps this is, on a smaller scale, much in the same way God sees us.

Is there a Hell? Is it fire, demons, and torture? I don't know. I choose to believe Hell is simply a term for a place that is in absence of God. And the description of it, is the conscious thought of what such an existence must entail. The literal opposite of Heaven but yet focused on the detail of the place, and not the actual purpose of the place. Is Heaven filled with streets of gold and giant white gleaming buildings and we fly around on clouds? Maybe... I don't know. But I DO believe Heaven is an existence where our proximity to God, is near and absent of the aspects of God, that do not represent what God stands for. Love. I believe ""Hell"" is likely the term for an existence opposite to that. Perhaps there is a place in-between, I do not know.

As someone that believes in God, there will always be questions I struggle with. The nature of suffering to those living things that cannot avoid it. The path of existence for those that choose to live outside of love and bring great harm to others, etc. I will always ask the question, because my brain is able to produce such thought. 

At the end of the day, I think Dr. Seuss probably had it right. The NEED to be different. To justify our differences in a manner that makes US feel better. To have a star on my belly because you do not. These are things that cloud what likely is the true nature of the teachings of Jesus and others. That maybe, just maybe, it's less about how you believe. And all about that you believe, and how it shapes the way you treat others. Life can be hard enough. We don't need to make it even harder on each other.

That, is what I believe."

She'll even do this when clients are present.  

To get her to order spare parts you have to call up another secretary who will force her to answer the phone.  You then have to tell her what to do, how much she should be paying, and offer a small token of your appreciation to get her to do it.  Note its the same 10 things she always order, I could easily replace her with an excel string.  She must be fucking a director or something cause she should have been fired years ago.  "

In the 90's a friend of mine visited Cuba just to have an adventure. He was so surprised whenever he was driving and would stop at a stop sign or red light and total strangers would open the passenger doors and just jump in and go along for the ride. Everyone was so friendly and hospitable and the next thing he knew he was invited to meet every passenger's whole family and share meals with all of them. This happened quite often and he met more people in 2 weeks than he had after living in San Francisco for 2 years.

Exactly many people forget that as a video game tester you don't just get to play the fun parts of the game like it's a hobby.

"My escapism fantasy. Ever since I've started working in a cubicle (7 years ago) I've had daily day dreams of running away. My life is boring. My family is nearly non existent, Most of them have died. Holidays suck. Ever been to a Thanksgiving dinner for two? 

One day I'm going to quit my job, hop in the car and drive out west. Just don't know when that day will come.  

EDIT:

Thanks for the great comments. I really appreciate people taking the time out of their day to leave me a note. It means a lot.

Just for those that are curious, money is not the issue. I have plenty, thanks to generous parents and a lucrative career. Not enough to retire on quite yet (I'm only 28) but I hope to hang up my when I turn 40. I am finishing up a masters degree that should open some doors for me career wise. I'm hoping that will help. Otherwise, my life is fairly stagnant. I moved home to be with my mom after my father died  almost 4 years ago and have yet to move out. I think our depression/grief feeds off each other. Not very healthy. But I like having someone to come home to after work and she likes not having an empty house. So we tread on. 

I'm pretty convinced that my day dreaming and escapism thoughts are directly correlated to my depression. I guess some people are suicidal others just want to pick up and leave. I wonder how much of my anxiety, depression, and attitude would follow me no matter where I go. 

I'm seriously considering giving myself a trial run in two years when I turn 30. Give my two weeks, pack the car and go for a while. I'd really like to see the Grand Canyon and Glacier National Park.

"In any type of vendor negotiations or productions, always triple bid (i.e. get at least 3 bids).

If all 3 come in around the same price, choose your favorite.

If 1 is an extreme outlier (either high or low) then you can throw them out. They are either overcharging, scoped incorrectly, or undercharging and will hit you with another bill later on for add-ons.

The bids that come in at a similar price point are probably a fair price.

If you get 3 bids and they are all massively different in price, then the scope of the assignment probably wasn't clear."
"I used to own a animation graphics forum with over 10,000 members.

It focused mainly on pivot stick figure animator but we had all sorts of content and graphic creators that posted/lurked our forums. I was so proud of it.. Thousands of people a day visiting and posting.

I had several mods of course to help keep up with reports and equality. Like a dumb ass I left one mod group the ability to edit/move categories.

I logged in one day to see all my boards deleted. Since I gave that mod powers to edit categories (but not boards) he was able to delete all the categories hosting all the boards. We lost everything.

I was so pissed. And he never even offered a reason.

I revived the boards but the threads were gone. Visitor count steadily dropped and my forums died a slow death.

"You reminded me of this classic test:

&gt;I was a very happy man. My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. There was only one little thing bothering me—it was her beautiful younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, and generally was bra-less. She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view. It had to be deliberate. Because she never did it when she was near anyone else.
One day her “little” sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn’t overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. Well, I was in total shock, and couldn’t say a word.
She said, “I’m going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.”
I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door.
I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!
With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, “We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn’t ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.” The moral of this story is: Always keep your condoms in your car."

Edit: she also told my friend to stop standing up for people the teacher was falsely accusing.

Edit2: she also laughed at my best friend for asking if they could pray for his day who had a surgery that day. if done incorrectly he might not have been able to work anymore. They were already living paycheck to paycheck.

She only did this to boys as far as I know.

She also sat in or outside of our classes to scream at us for misbehaving. She even told us we couldn't talk in after school art club after making herself assistant or something.

Edit 3: I just remembered this. She literally have my friend a detention for touching his hair repeatedly. Meanwhile she let girls French braid in her class."
"Early in the morning of 9/11 I looked out the window of my school a few blocks away and saw one tower on fire. Later, I watched the towers burn from a science lab. They evacuated us just as they were collapsing completely and we walked up the highway in air that was black and full of ashes"
"I did. I bought a used truck without even looking inside it. My husband pointed to it on the lot and said he wanted it. After we were in an accident, I went and bought it for him as a surprise. My dad looked at it while I was at work and said it looked fine; he even went to the credit union and got the ball rolling on a loan. I basically showed up, signed my name, and drove it home. We kept it 8 years and it was a good truck."

"My wife leaves her cereal bowl on the bar every morning. Every single morning, she eats a bowl of cereal, absentmindedly sets it down, and gets ready for her day and forgets about it. The sink is two feet away. If I don't put it in the sink, she'll stack them on the counter. We've talked about it, argued about it, had the subject come up in fights. I've broken a bowl by over-exaggerating putting it in the sink. She apologizes, puts them in the sink for a while, but eventually goes back to forgetting. It's aggravating, because if somethings not in the sink she'll forget to clean them when she does the dishes, despite them being directly behind her. Then we have no clean bowls. So then I have to either clean her gross week old cereal bowls, or eat my soup out of a can like a goddamn savage.

It's frustrating but I'd rather move an empty bowl two feet every morning than live without her."

"I used to play a lot of Counter-Strike: Source. I was a regular in one community and was quite good and well known. There was one member who hated me. He was just promoted to half-admin, so he just had some admin abilities on the servers and forums. While playing I got naded from behind. Didn't even see it coming so I yelled ""What the fudge?!"" (Didn't even say fuck). He kicked me from the server for ""disrespectful language"". I came back and asked why I was kicked. He said ""Admins have the final say. Do not question our decisions."" And kicked me again. So I came back a 3rd time and asked ""What did I even do?!"" And he banned me for the day. I went to the forums to lodge a complaint and he had already put in a request to permaban me. It didn't go through. Luckily when I complained a bunch of people who saw this came to my defense and told the real admins what happened. 

This guy disliked me because I was better than him and his first day with some admin abilities he abuses the shit out of them to try to get rid of me.  "

Cashing in his goodboy® points
"Not a lawyer but my two bosses were married and opened a bike shop together. He was the brains and the backbone since he was a former Olympic mechanic, she just sort of balanced the checkbook and worked a couple days a week. Unfortunately, he had no credit and she did, so when they opened everything was in her name. 

All he wanted in the divorce was the bike shop and was willing to buy her half. She wanted the bike shop too, but didn't want to buy him out for his half. Mind you, her father passed away and she was sitting on like $300k in the bank (and also had the audacity to take out student loans for her daughter to go to college). 

He lost the bike shop and I think he got a little bit of money for his share. What she didn't expect was that all of the high-paying customers would stop going there. They were all his friends or they only wanted him to work on their bikes (so I don't know why she would have had that notion). So he opened up his own bike shop and all of the ""regulars"" have become regulars at the new bike shop. 

EDIT: I've been seeing a lot of comments asking how he gained the credit to open a new shop. Ever since he moved out of the house he shared with his ex wife, he started putting money away and got a credit card. So over the course of a year+ some months he built credit and was able to open a shop on his own. People have tried to ""buy-in"" to the business as an investment but he doesn't want anyone else involved since that screwed him over the first time. 

EDIT 2: I appreciate everyone's upvotes. If anyone is ever having any bike-related issues, head on over to r/bikewrench. I spend a lot of time there diagnosing and offering fixes for people's bikes. I don't work in a bike shop anymore, I just work on my friends' bikes for fun, and dabble in some frame building for myself. But remember to support your local bike shop. Don't buy bikes from department stores because they're typically dangerous as they aren't built by actual bike mechanics."

"This happened once while camping with my then-fiance and a friend of ours. Camped out in the woods in the middle of nowhere on a hot July day. Night came, and it was a full moon so around midnight we decided we'd take a hike around for fun. We basically hiked a trail for a bit and then turned around and hiked it back to the campsite. When we were almost back, we saw a McDonalds cup sitting at the edge of the path. I found this strange as I didn't see the bright red and yellow container when we began the venture, but whatever. However, my buddy decided to open the cup up **and found ice cubes at the bottom**. 

That day was easily 90+F and at night it was still in the high 70's, so that ice would not have lasted long. Somebody was definitely out there by us and we never found another sign of them. No sound of a car, walking or rustling - nothing. 

We decided to pack up and go home that night."

"Edit - Wow I didn't think so many people would see this, lots of questions I need to answer. Probably the main one is that I didn't take a shit in a bin again after that event, something about seeing myself in a mirror shitting into a bin hit me hard.

A few years ago me and my wife moved in to her parents place to save some money, so we were adjusting to living with parents again, it was strange and uncomfortable.

I woke up one morning and it felt like the world was about to fall out of my butthole, I went to open the bedroom door and could hear my father in law getting ready to head out for work. I'm panicking thinking fuck, I know this is gonna be bad, I'm not gonna go take this mega dump so early on into our time living here, I need to devise a plan.

I stayed in the bedroom, emptied out the little bin we had in the corner, and shit into the bag that was placed in there, I wipe my butt with some tissues that happened to be on the side, stand up and tie a knot in the bag. 

Now I'm getting ready for work with this bag of shit by my feet, my next stage is to get rid of this thing, I can't do it in any of the bins here, think fuck it I'll take it out and find the nearest one I can see, I even question putting this bag of shit in a neighbours place if nobody sees. 

I walked 15 minutes to work with a bag of my own crap in my hoody pocket until I could find a public bin to throw it in. 

TLDR - I shit in a bag and carried it work.

"My uncle represented this guy getting a divorce from his wife of 15 years. Super toxic breakup and they split everything 50/50, even the land that the house they lived in sat upon. Well she decides to build a house right behind the other house, mind you this was a lot of land probably 200 yards separating both home sites, so that the back of the houses faced each other. The house gets built and my uncle gets a call from his client asking about the legality of a situation he had gotten himself into. Apparently his ex wife would spend a lot of time in her backyard, so he saw her all the time. What he did was buy a female dog and name it the same name as his ex-wife. Anytime he would let his dog back in from letting her out he would yell ""Susan you bitch! Get in here!"" He would also yell if she was peeing on the flowers,""Susan you bitch! Quit pissing on the flowers!"" or ""Susan you bitch! Quit digging in the dirt!"" The ex-wife called the cops on him a couple of times, but there was nothing they could do because the dog was registered under the name of Susan, and it was in fact a bitch so there you go.

"Was taking my dog (yellow lab) for a walk with my dad when I was maybe 8 years old, we just started to head back to the house and about halfway there a bear appears in the middle of the street. The bear was standing on it's hind legs standing about 12 feet tall looking angry as all hell. My dad put me behind his back upon noticing the cub on the side of the road because he knew this bear wasn't fucking around if it thought it's cub was in danger.

Next thing I knew my dog charged at the bear full speed and tackled it down the hill off the side of the road and me and my dad both thought that that was the end of our dog until about a minute later we see our dog strolling up the hill without a scratch on her. She wrestled a bear all the way down the hill and won and most likely saved mine and my dad's life. 

Damn I loved that dog. "

"How I felt afterwards. I had to speak with an on-site psychiatrist for a few weeks after that call because it was so personal.

The policy at the hotline is to pass on calls to others if you are related to the caller. However I didn't feel like I could pass on my mom to another person after being passed on to me.  
I mean, how would you feel being passed around on the phone at a suicide prevention hotline like you've called tech support?

"I planned on killing my baby daughter when I was going trough a postpartum depression.. The postpartum depression totally changed me as a person at the time, and all I wished for was for my baby to cease existing, so I planned to kill her. I first did two ""practice runs"" where I covered her face and nose for a few seconds to see how I would react to the sight of her suffocating, it didn't effect me. So I decided to go trough with the dead two weeks later when my SO would be out of the house for the entire day. The plan was to make it seem like a accident by holding her face down in the mattress of her bed (since she was still to young to turn around and those kind of accidents to occur)

But a couple of days before the day I planned on doing it when me and my SO was talking we somehow got to talk about the hypothetical situation of our daughter dying, and my SO started crying just by the thought of her dying. And that was when I realized that killing our daughter would absolutely wreck him and potentially hunt him for the rest of his life and I didn't want to inflict that kind of pain on him. And that conversation is probably the only reason why I didn't go trough with the killing..

As of today I'm back to my normal self and I'm quite haunted by what I did and planned to do back then. Whenever I think of the way her little body panicked in those few seconds where I practiced on suffocating her I break down crying, its a image that haunts me.

And my daughter lives with full custody with her father (my mental health caused by parenthood ruined our relationship) today since I'm simply not fit to be a parent. And I just want to add that I never did her any harm except for those few seconds."
"A few years ago I was in Prague with a couple of my friends. We were back packing across Eastern Europe and Prague was the second stop. It had been a long train ride in from Amsterdam, so we went out to start celebrating quite early. I, in particular, probably went a little too hard too fast. By 10pm I was quite drunk and the constant smoking amplified my feels for the day. There were also a few shots of Absinthe that were taken(there is always a debate whether they make you hallucinate or not, but there is not debate that they make you shit face drunk).

The next few parts of the night are still a blur, but somehow I left my friends and found my self walking around on the street outside the bar we had been in. Something happened, rather I probably did something, that started an altercation of sorts with a random stranger. We were able to mesh it quite peacefully, but not after some loud noises and causing quite a scene.

I decided to walk away to kind of just get away from the area in case any trouble arrived. I was walking down a quite side alley that I remember from earlier in the day led to my hotel, when an unmarked white van creeped passed me. Now mind you, my friends and I had idiotically just watched all two of the ""Hostel"" movies before we had left for Europe, so that whole kidnapping thing was still fresh in my mind. I started walking faster and faster, almost came to a running pace when I thought I was just over-reacting and that the Van was long gone. Less than a few seconds later, I hear brakes screeching behind me, and turn to see three large guys running towards me and the same White van parked right behind them. They grabbed me and threw me inside the van before I even knew what was up.

I was completely shit scared at this point, and tried to reason with the four guys in the van but they didn't speak a lick of English, or at least didn't respond to my pleas. We drove a few block until we came to a stop light, and I decided that this was my last chance to make a break for it or else I was completely fucked. I dove over one of the guys sitting next to me and straight out the Van door that I somehow managed to open fairly quickly. I got maybe half a block before the guy caught up to me and tackled me. I looked around and tried to scream to any onlookers to help, but of course there was no one around to be seen. They handcuffed me in the van the rest of the way.

We got to some building, very old, and the hallways we walked in looked old and dilapidated. I was still freaking out too much to think sanely or getting any real bearing of the place. They tried talking to me for a bit, but I couldn't make out the few english words they said to me, so they took me took a prison cell-esque room and started tying me down on a bed. There was blood on the headrest of this bed, and this was the moment I started realizing that something really bad was going to happen to me from that point on.

They left to go do something for a few minutes, and in those few minutes it was life or death time for me. Still to this day, I look back at those few minutes and really admire myself and what I tried to do; you always think that when you are in a life or death situation, you will fight to survive any which way you can, but you don't really know until you are actually in one.

I started trying to take off the straps immediately. There were two on my wrists, and two around my ankles. I kicked and wiggled and did everything that was humanly possible to get out of those leather shackles. I was able to get off the two feet shackles within a few minutes, and started focusing everything I had on my wrists. I have never fought harder to do anything in my entire life. I was fully convinced that in a few minutes, I would be dead if I didn't get this done right at this moment. Somehow I was able to get the shackles off my wrists, while skinning them in the process. I had blood pouring out of cuts from both my wrists and ankles, but I was free of them. I went over to the window and punched right through it, but to my utter dismay, there were bars right behind it. There was nothing I could do, I was completely trapped with no chance of escape.
My captors heard the commotion and came running into the room. They grabbed me and tied my down to the bed again, and this time put one strap over my chest, leaving me effectively unable to wiggle or move.

This was it. I was fucking done for. In the next few moments, I made peace with death for the first time in my life. A beautiful wave of peace washed through my entire body, and I laid in my bed feeling completely OK with the world. I thought about my parents and my friends, and hoped that they would at least learn of my death and not left wondering what happened to me. I thought about my dog, and hoped that she wouldn't think I just abandoned her. I thought about quite a few things, but all with a peaceful heart.

An hour, or what felt like an hour, passed and no one came. I thought for sure they would have began skinning me alive by this point, or whatever sick torture device they would have chosen for me. This was also around the time I started getting sober and that damn Absinthe started leaving my mind. A few things I had previously been oblivious to started coming into focus. This place I was in wasn't as dilapidated and abandoned as I had previously thought. I could hear noises of people coming from down the hallway, and it reminded me of a public place, not a dilapidated kill house that I had convinced myself I was in. The street outside my now broken window also seemed quite alive.

It was around this time that two of my captors decided to come into my room again, and I started realizing that they weren't going to kill me. They came into my room wearing ragity looking lab coats, but on these coats was also name tags. The next few minutes, everything started making a little sense. They gave me a breathalyzer, cleaned up my cuts and bandaged them. Afterwards, they took me out to a waiting room with quite a few people in it, gave me my clothes back as well as a nice ticket for public intoxication and a hefty bill for my stay.

A couple things I've learned from my first stay in a Prague prison/hospital: I'm never drinking Absinthe ever again, I'm never watching fucked up movies that scare the crap out of me before a vacation, and that I'm pretty sure that if/when I am in an actual life and death situation, I will have the will to fight for my survival. That was my most fucked up night ever, and the strongest instance of fear I have ever felt."

"People around you, people you might interact with on a daily basis... well some have had really fucked up things happen to them. Some have been tortured (like actual real torture), some have been raped, some have had loved people choke to death in their arms, some have had to kill others in combat, some have been mock-executed. Also on the non-trauma side I guess what I found rather shocking was how everyone can be affected by mental illness. Loving mother? BAM now you think the mafia wants to poison your every drink and have send your child as a spy: you've become psychotic due to depression+psychosis/schizophrenia/drug sequela . Successful student - BAM you just got into major debt because you gambled it all away while having a maniac episode. Mental illness strikes at random and can't be well understood from the outside by your family and friends, it's like an invisible curse and people actually shun you because they're scared of you, don't get what you're going through, all they see is this ""fucking weirdo"". People get really lonely because no one understands them (if you're affected: professionals actually kind of know what you're going through that's why therapy helps!)"

"I once worked at the aquatics area of a summer camp (swimming, kayaks, etc.).  Whenever the director left, his assistant became the working director, and behaved like the Emperor of the Lake.

One time I made a mistake, and he ordered me to swim out to a buoy and back.  That meant an eighth-mile of swimming in open water.  (That may not sound like much, but swimming is much slower and more taxing than walking) When I questioned the punishment, he immediately doubled it for ""talking back.""  When I questioned *that*, he added another eighth-mile, and another.  Half a mile of swimming, over almost nothing.

I refused, betting that when the director returned, he would decline to enforce something so excessive.  Fortunately, I was right, but the assistant continued to be a pain in the ass until he was fired a month later.

**EDIT**: I see many replies debating whether a half-mile is *really* a long swim.  This story isn't about the exact magnitude of the punishment.  It's about the arbitrary and petty manner in which my boss deployed the punishment.
If I had volunteered and prepared for a half-mile swim, I would have been fine.  I might have even enjoyed it!  But this was abruptly forced on me during a lunch break.  *That's* why I refused."

She makes a point of putting them loose at the top of her bag, and when it gets searched, they fall all over the place.

"Fake reviews. 


I worked for a startup that had a sleezy CEO and got most, if not all, of their business by fake Yelp, Google, Glassdoor and other review sites in our industry. CEO was a compulsive liar and had no morals. 

Side Note: I left the company and shit when straight downhill as it was a house of cards anyway and I had a key position. The CEO ended up calling his business partner of three years and telling him that all the money was gone and he is leaving the country forever. . . then didn't leave. He still has the company open with a much smaller staff and can only imagine what he is saying to keep it afloat. Ok done with the rant.


It is easy to see fake reviews now since they are usually a bit more eccentric and polished and I have lost all faith in them. "

"Harry sat in silence, doing his best to stay calm. Professor Snape was anything but forgiving when it came to late homework, even when a student had a completely reasonable excuse... like having been called to the headmaster's personal chambers, for instance. It was all too easy to imagine the dark sneer that would be turned in Harry's direction, along with the venomous, mocking tone that would doubtlessly accompany the words ""Ten points from Gryffindor.""

The sound of approaching footsteps reached Harry's ears, as did the many quiet rustling noises of students pulling out textbooks and notes. His heart started to pound in his chest. As the classroom's door swung open, though, it was not the imposing Head of Slytherin who entered, but rather a blond man in a white coat that had been buttoned up to his neck.

""Good morning, class!"" he said. Harry was surprised by how warm and reassuring the man's voice was. ""My name is Professor Ramsay, and I'll be filling in for Professor Snape today. Those of you from Muggle households may have seen my work on Britain's myriad cooking shows.""

Harry's jaw dropped. Ramsay? Gordon Ramsay? His aunt and uncle had watched the man on television, with Petunia frequently scoffing at what she called ""fancy food,"" and Vernon apparently making notes of some choice insults to try out later. The idea that a famous chef could also be a wizard had never even crossed Harry's mind... but in a way, it made perfect sense.

""Now, then,"" Professor Ramsay continued, ""who out there can catch me up?""

Hermione's hand rose almost before the man had completed his sentence. ""Professor Ramsay,"" she said, her demeanor showing nothing but firm respect for academia, ""we have been learning about invigoration potions.""

""Wizard coffee!"" laughed Ramsay. ""I never touch the stuff, myself. Name the best method of brewing it, Miss...?""

""Granger,"" Hermione replied. ""To brew an effective invigoration potion, it is necessary to...""

""I didn't say 'effective,'"" Ramsay interrupted. ""I said 'best.' What is the *best* method? In one word, please.""

Hermione paused, apparently considering. Harry felt himself growing nervous on her behalf. Would the professor get impatient? Would he lash out with one of his famous rants?

""Hot,"" answered Hermione at last.

""'Hot!'"" Ramsay said back. ""Yes! The hotter, the better! Ten points to Gryffindor!""

For the second time in as many minutes, Harry's mouth fell open... but then its corners turned upward into an excited smile.

Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all."
"Worst way to die, according to a former NYC Medical Examiner:
“What’s the worst way to die?” is the next most-asked question, to which Melinek usually replies, “You don’t want to know.”
When people insist, however, she tells them about Sean Doyle. Around Christmas 2002, bartender Doyle went out drinking with pal Michael Wright and Wright’s girlfriend. As they all walked home, Wright thought Doyle was hitting on his girlfriend, and witnesses later told cops they saw a man getting “the s–t beat out of him.” He was heard screaming, “No, don’t break my legs!” and another witness said he saw someone throw Doyle down an open manhole.

The drop was 18 feet. At the bottom was a pool of boiling ­water, from a broken main. Doyle didn’t die instantly — in fact, as first responders arrived, he was standing below, reaching up and screaming for help. No paramedic or firefighter could climb down to help — it was, a Con Ed supervisor said, 300 degrees in the steam tunnel.

Four hours later, Sean Doyle’s body was finally recovered. Its temperature was 125 degrees — the medical examiners thought it was likely way higher, but thermometers don’t read any higher than that. When Melinek saw the body on her autopsy table, she writes, she thought he’d “been steamed like a lobster.” His entire outer layer of skin had peeled off, and his internal organs were literally cooked.

He otherwise had no broken bones and no head trauma, which meant he was fully conscious as he boiled to death.
“The worst nightmares I ever had in my two years at OCME,” Melinek writes, “came after I performed the postmortem examination of Sean Doyle.”"

"I was a forest fire lookout in the summers during college. Went weeks between seeing another human sometimes. Some of the things I witnessed or heard while doing that job are just flat unexplained.
The one that most sticks out in my mind was laying in bed and watching a strange light move through the trees. Figured it was a car with headlights in until it went vertical up into the air and hung for 30 min. Just sitting 20-30 miles away, about parallel with my tower. I was at an elevation of 7000 ft. I watched it until it dipped back below the trees and never saw it again.

At the time I was super creeped out, but chalked it up to the another one of those dozens of things I've seen that I couldn't explain and no one would believe. But the next day another lookout called me on the radio asking if I'd seen the same light. He was much closer to but on the other side of it. He said from his perspective, after it dipped below the trees, it landed in an area he knew to be a lake that was only accessable by hiking or horseback. 

It stood out in my mind because it was the only strange light that summer we couldn't explain away by either planes, balloons or tricks of light from cars. I have since wondered if this was a drone, but this was before they we're really obtainable to hobbists and have never seen one with lights that could be seen that bright from 20 miles or one that will hold a hover for 30 min that was around then.

I saved the best for last. The lake where that light settled down into according to the other lookout, is pretty popular spot for trout fishing. That summer the lake developed some form of algae or something and all the fish died off. They stocked it with fish and they just keep dying off. No one remembers this happening before that summer we saw the light land in it. It was like this for the next 3 summers that I came back as a lookout. No fish could live in it.. Just  another weird story from my early 20s as a fire lookout.

Dug around after I got off work and found some pictures from my time. First one is the view from the first tower I was on.

This is what a fire would look like to me. This is about 10 miles out, behind a ridge, about 1-2 acres in size. What's interesting about this picture I just noticed is it has 3 of the 4 mountains I worked in the picture if you included the mountain I took the picture from. The big round ridge line on the left side of the pic is my first lookout, and in the distance you can just see the third tower I worked on the horizon. That horizon is close to 50 miles out.

My dad once told me that he was going to 'ground' me due to my poor performance in school.  So I simply responded with, 'go ahead, ground me.  It's not like I go anywhere anyway.'  His dead silence after that was an acknowledgement that he knew I had a point there.

"Somewhere around 1990, I was about 11 and was walking with a friend when a guy grabbed me and threw me the back seat of his car. His daughter was in the front seat and they were looking for someone who had been hassling the girl at our local park, and she recognized me from the park and thought I knew the guy. I kind of did but only by first name and didn't know where he lived. But then I got a great idea, I said I knew where he lived and had the guy drive to where I lived. As soon as the car stopped, I jumped out. All the neighbors were out and blocked him in so he couldn't leave before the cops showed up.

He was arrested but between being young at the time and this being nearly 30 years ago, I don't remember what happened to him. "

My uncle said, “How much weight can you tote?”
I said, “One bag of grain.” my uncle laughed.
“When I was your age,” my uncle said,
“I could drive a wagon--and lift a calf.”

My uncle said, “How many fights have you had?”
I said, “Two--and both times I got whipped.”
“When I was your age,” my uncle said,
“I fought every day--and was never licked.”

My uncle said, “How old are you?”
I said, “Nine and a half,” and then
My uncle puffed out his chest and said,
“When I was your age… I was ten.”"

Edit 2 - Fixed some phone typos. There are a lot of people that continue to point out that there are different types of aluminum and most people already know that. You're reading too far into the joke. ""Aircraft grade"" doesn't tell you anything. There are many different types of aluminum used on aircraft.

"A year ago, we got a new, massive-wood dining table, which cost around 3000€. On the first day of ownership, I knocked over a glass of wine (the table was intended to get a blanket, but this was before there was a blanket on it). In panic, I cleaned it with a cotton cloth. Turns out, there was some sand or something on the cloth - left nasty scratches on the table.

I covered it up with a blanked immediately, no one saw it. A few days later I ordered a rubber cover to put it under the tablecloth. Told my parents this would protect the table if someone knocks a glass of wine. They didn't notice  because the rubber cover never gets removed, only the tablecloth."

"Before moving in you should take pictures of areas that show existing damage and note that in their form during your walk-thru. Even though they signed off on the form which I stated the existing damage, they still tried to charge for things like water damage to window sills and cupboards that were already there. Also it'd be wise to take a black light through the place before move-in. They tried to charge me for a urine stain they missed from a previous owner who had pets. And lastly, they tried to charge for cleaning the oven.. Except I cleaned the oven. But I forgot to take out the aluminum foil I put in the bottom to catch drips, and they wanted $50, the price of a full cleaning, to remove it."

"Yep my very first lyft ride ever the notification binged that someone needed me and I was so excited that I just accepted, not realizing it was in the scariest most dangerous area around, that I promised myself I  wouldn't go to. I decide to still take it because the name of the customer was a woman (I am too). I wait for 5 minutes and a scary looking dude comes up, says that he's who the ride was called for, and gets in. He won't tell me where he's going, he just gives me directions. I'm petrified, driving him 20 minutes to another dangerous town, thinking I've just gotten myself killed, and then we finally pulled up to the building where he was trying to go. It was a high school. The kid was 15, and in high school, and his mother called the lyft for him because he missed the bus. I felt like a real judgemental asshole."

Tip for future people in wheelchairs, don't get the automatic one, it'll make you weak and will slow your process to recovery. Suffer through the type you have to push your self. Only reason I'm able to walk today.

Edit: wow this amount of comments is surprising.. I saw this thread and had to quickly post my story, and haven't gone back on since because I am traveling. But since a lot of people asked I'll give my story.

I fell 42 feet rock climbing at a camp I was volunteering at. I broke my spine in 8 different places and shattered my right ankle into powder and split my shin in two. Broke and dislocated my left ankle, got a major concusion and sprained both my wrist. Spent 5 weeks at a children's hospital and 3 and a half months at a rehab facility. A year in a wheelchair and 2.5 years on crutches. And have had 6 surgeries. Almost amputated my leg but there a leg brace I am using now, if it doesn't work in the long run then I may have to amputate. I was 15 when I fell and am 21 now.
If there's any specific question I will gladly answer, slowly but I will answer. 
To those who commented about the wheel chair with similar stories, keep strong, and always support your family who's in a wheel chair, don't just ""be there"" for them. Push them to better then selves in what ever way! I started off with Lifting 5 pound weights in my bed. And was happy when I had the strength to wheel 10 meters down a hallway. Every victory counts, and to all my brothers and sisters in wheelchairs, wheel on!
(Side note my theme song for a long time was ""They see me Rolling"" just for the irony, got a hat that said that and wore it all the time when I was in the wheelchair.)

"Similarly, take pics of any existing damage to a rental as soon as you move in and email it to the landlord/leasing office. I did this after a landlord told us he took the last tenant's entire security deposit for damage (to be fair, it sounded like the tenant really messed shit up). I took that as a flag, and sent him a very detailed email of every hint of damage I could find. 12 months later, after we moved out he emailed me to say he was going to deduct $100 from our security for damage. I reminded him of the email I sent him, and never heard from the fucker again.

I participated in helping in creating KKK recruitment flyers for my relatives and just hung out with the wrong crowd doing dumb shit I shouldn't have. Eventually I moved to Austin. I met my now black wife at a temp agency. We were both working for a distribution warehouse for a local Texas grocery. She's the best thing that happened to me in terms of my life and growth.  To be frank, my family practically disowned me and my relatives constantly threaten to kill us. Her family loves me even after I was upfront with them about my past. What I notice from my own experience of my white upbringing and other minorities is that they are far more welcoming, forgiving, and open. I don't want to go into much detail because it's a really long story. I just know that she opened my eyes  and I'm forever grateful for her. "

"I made a separate account because I don't want this associated with my regular one since I got my life back together. I used to sell ""services"" to random guys which helped me get out of being homeless after a few months. I'm not gay but I was desperate to get out of my predicament and did what I had too. I'm a pretty feminine looking man when I had long hair and that attracted a lot of old men, lonely men, just randoms. Never really had problems with other homeless people because I stayed in a local city shelter at night and had to leave during day time. Hanging around convenient stores and parking lots where they have game rooms (slot machine rooms) is where I got most of my clients. Most of them were chill. Get what they want and leave. Some were crazy. One guy in particular wanted me to stay at his place overnight and spend the next day with him for a $1000. I decided cool and we went to his house. The guy had what I can describe is like a torture sex dungeon in his garage. He had some type of black filament with egg cartons all over the walls and bdsm type stuff laying around. I decided it wasn't a good idea and said I changed my mind but he wouldn't let me leave. We were yelling back and forth and he punched me in the collar bone. It didn't hurt probably because of adrenaline. I used to do kyokushin Karate as a kid/teenager  so after he hit me, I kicked him as hard as I could in the balls and kneed him in the temple and ran out the house. I ran from block to block hiding becuase I was afraid he would try to kidnap me or call the cops. I never saw the guy again even after going back to the spots I always hang out at.  I eventually made enough money to get an apartment and eventually a logistics job for a supply chain."

"Happened about a year ago, but I had Uber'd a girl from the university in my area. She was pale, freckled, blue eyes, with dirty blond hair, and had a single dread lock twisted within it. We chatted for a bit about our goals and interests in life, she seemed really down to earth. When I brought up that I made music, she asked if I had any songs I could show her.  I put on my most played song that I had at the time and more than half the song consisted of her commentary on how much she loved it. Considering how gorgeous this girl was, I was a bit more than flattered. She tells me to keep it on my SoundCloud  and asks me if I had ever gotten head while listening to my own music. I tell her no and that I had been single for a while. Her response was music to my ears, ""Well there's a first time for everything, right""? At this point I'm praying I don't crash my car with the jolt of endorphins rushing through me. Long story short, I blew my load before we reached destination and let's just say she was no quitter. I got her number, but nothing evolved beyond that. She still listens to my music, according to SoundCloud.

"How little you matter to anyone.

There are two kinds of people I learned to avoid very quickly- groups of young men/teenagers, and fellow homeless men. If someone's gonna fuck with you, they'll fall in one of these groups, and people may watch disapprovingly, but they won't do anything to help you.

It's less important to most people that you be somewhere safe or with a bit of shelter from the weather, than it is that you be where they don't have to see you. Most of your interactions with people such as the police, who in normal life you consider to be concerned primarily with your safety, when you're homeless are more about making you less inconvenient to others."

"'terrible' I guess. 

Lied about finishing college, I'm pretty socially inept and since I spent tons of time at home alone when it came time for the ceremony and everything, no one in my family questioned that I didn't want to go. Main horrible thing is that even though I failed the entire last year, and my degree being stem and very technical, I just listed my degree on my resume as if I had graduated.

I started applying for jobs and got an interview at a big company, like one so big that they would definitely do legit background checks. I went through all the hiring process, lying all the way whenever I needed to about my degree, basically just waiting for them to stop calling me once they found out I never graduated. 

Never happened, instead I got a call one day for my official 'start day', and have now been working here for ~4 years. 

I basically live in constant fear that I'll be found out and dread the thought of leaving this company and being found out while getting another job, I've turned down doing things that would have my name more out in public in fear that someone will do the research and find out I never graduated. I have an ulcer and I'm convinced it's because of this related stress.

I'm still a very solitary person and pretty okay with it so I think about getting some job unrelated to my degree in a warehouse, factory or something and move back in with my parents just so I don't have to live with this anymore.

**edit**: As people are still reading this just thought I'd say I'm officially aboard the 'transfer your credits and finish your damn degree' train. 

The stress, money, difficulty of my job when I initially started, and mainly just fear were keeping me from going back to school. It was dumb of me for sure, probably could have done it 2 years ago but you see the decisions I make, not always the best. 

And yes I'm on medication for the ulcer, thanks for your concerns; my job that I have thanks to lying about my degree, provides great insurance."

"Wrestling.  I started freshman year, won 1 match all year. But I dropped 40 lbs so I came back again. 

Won 7 matches. 

Came back again, won 16 matches. 

Came back senior year. Undefeated half the year. Set the pin record for the school, took second at districts by one point, went to state.  Won my first match.  Then I got my ass handed to me by the next two people. 

Not even a competition.  They basically took 215 pound me, rolled me into a ball and walked away.  The only reason that the matches were longer than a round was because they were so good that their coaches would not allow them to finish the match by pin until they had scored a certain number of points.  I thought maybe they were outliers, so when I went to a D1 college I tried to get on the team, surely I could catch up.  The second string wrestlers wiped the floor with me constantly until the coaches asked me to stop coming to the practices because I was an insurance liability. "
"A man once tried to purchase sexual favors from me at a bus stop. I was initially convinced I'd misheard him, and asked him to repeat himself a bit louder. He re-iterated his desire for a blowjob.

I began laughing out of shock. 

Then I felt bad for making him feel awkward. So I started to apologize, assuring him that he was like. . . threatening and upsetting, and that the next girl would be very scared by him. But I couldn't stop laughing. 

He tried to leave. 

I tried to follow. Still laughing, still apologizing. I began offering him snacks by way of an apology (I was on my way home from Trader Joe's, and had a weekend's worth of overpriced junkfood with me). He started to walk faster. I chased him about halfway down the street, laughing, apologizing, assuring him he was scary, and offering him snacks before realizing I'd just fucked up that whole interaction, and went home. 

TLDR- I tried to respond politely to a dude who was sexually harassing me, and I think I traumatized him. "
"A guy at a pub, who was standing with his friends up at the bar, tripped me as I was walking in. I brushed it off, no big deal.

I followed him to the bathroom and tapped his shoulder while he was washing his hands. He turned around and I grabbed him by the neck of the shirt and head-butted him right across the bridge of his nose. "

I used to teach at a university that had been a luxury hotel in the 19th century. In the lobby of the main building there was an antique elevator that no longer functioned but they kept it on display for historical interest while the real elevator was around the corner. To avoid confusion there was a big sign in front of the elevator explaining that it did not work and pointing to the real one. I taught on the second floor of this building one semester and had a student on crutches come in several minutes late because she'd been standing in the antique elevator trying to get it to run. She would have had to have gone past the big sign to get into it too. I believed her because she wasn't the brightest student.

"It's was pretty crazy. There was a loud thud and a bunch of screaming. I was at an adjacent machine and saw it with my peripheral vision. I saw a blur of her hit the ground fast. At first, I thought she was tired and collapsed from walking/running. Then I realized no one was there before and the treadmill wasn't running.

She was lying there for a while unresponsive. There was a crowd surrounding her and the staff was getting people to move away and called an ambulance. The mother was crying and smacking the brother. She woke up crying and was wheeled away afterwards. 

There was some talk the next day. One of the cleaners said she's doing fine. She apparently broke her arm and sprained her ankle though."
"I was from a large family and discipline was very strict. If myself or one of my siblings broke one of the major rules, my parents would hold a 'Truth Session'. 

All the children would be brought to my Dad's study where the guilty party would be given an opportunity to confess. If nobody came forward, we would be hit in  turn in order of ascending age. The eldest four were hit with a sewer rod while, in deference to their age, the youngest ones would get a whack of a bamboo stick. 

A sewer rod is basically a four foot long flexible rubber rod, around an inch thick and with a metal cap. It would leave the most remarkable welts. Horrendous things really.

Anyway, this would continue until someone admitted their 'guilt'. At that point they would receive the blows that everyone else had received to that point.

So that was awful. I fully acknowledge that. I'm under no illusions. However, that wasn't the actual unreasonableness. No, the unreasonable part was that the person who 'caused' the Truth Session didn't always receive the accrued punishment owed for having their siblings beaten. Sometimes they could just be let go making their siblings HATE them for causing pain to them. There'd be no explanation. The study door would be opened and we'd all be told to leave. That meant you could be rewarded for holding out and avoiding the punishment you'd definitely get if you admitted it at the beginning. 

My parents now tell fun stories about how when I was a child and I'd done something wrong, I'd always begin with, 'let me tell you my story.' 'Haha' they chortle at my childish phrasing while I recall the terror that such an approach was meant to stave off. "

"Last year I was hospitalized with a bad pulmonary infection. I had 800ml of fluid on EACH lung, plus more around my heart. Lungs were completely collapsed, acute cardiac tamponade. The team took one look at the scan and immediately one of the younger nurses muttered to the doctor ""how is her heart still beating???"" And the doctor just shook his head and gave him ""I don't know"" eyes. I'm all good now (knock on wood) but that was a pretty scary thing to hear...

Edit - some details:

I had had recurrent back pain for about three years (since I was 18). It would come on once every couple months. On day one of each bout I could feel it coming on. On day two, it was really bad - sharp pains in my upper back and neck, it felt like something was pushing on my lungs, I couldn't exercise or take deep breaths. Day three it usually had begun to taper off, day four it was usually gone. But then from fall of 2015 through the winter and spring of 2016, the bouts became more frequent and lasted longer and longer each time. 

I was misdiagnosed several times, with things like costochondritis and other musculoskeletal conditions. Finally, in May of 2016 I was on a trip to Arizona with my family and a friend (I do live in the US, I just used milliliters as the unit because that's what they used in the hospital), and the pain did not go away for the entire two weeks we were there. I pushed through it, and it would sometimes seem like it was starting to get better, but then it would come back.

When we were flying home (to Alaska), it got really bad. I could barely walk in the airport and my parents had to get me wheelchairs and hold all of my stuff for me. When I got home I decided to try to just take a bath and sleep in my own bed; that didn't help. So the next day I went to the ER and that's when they figured out what was actually up. As for why I didn't go to the ER sooner, I guess I just thought I was overreacting and that I needed to push through it. I won't be making that mistake again lol. "

"I was on an Outward Bound trip in the White River National Forest in Colorado. A part of OB trips is a solo, which can be anywhere from 12-48 hours in which the participants are by themselves with a journal and some snacks.

I set up a sweet tent in a tree grouping. It had rained the night before so the ground was pretty soft. After setting up I walked around the area. I felt pretty tired, and decided to take a nap... for 8 hours. I woke up in the middle of the night to a bunch of twigs cracking. It turned on my torch to look to see if it was the instructors or any kind of animal. I even called out, ""Hey, you good?"" (not sure why I said it that way). Nothing.

"She pulled out a knife and started running in circles around the house with it.  

I was on a bus back home the next day.

Edit: I guess I should provide a little context.
The short version, right before that, she was mad about something her cousin had done, so she came in to complain to me about it. I was busy reading Harry Potter and not listening to what she was saying, so she hauled off and punched me in the balls. She immediately had my attention. I jumped up all ""what the fuck?"" and she started to try to punch me. I grabbed her by her tiny wrists and stopped her. She settle down a little and I let her go. Then she went and grabbed a knife and started circling the house.

In the end she said she wanted to cut herself and not me, but I wasn't cool with any of that.

The long version involved her dad raping her, her mother in prison, she lived with her grandma, she got pregnant,  her grandma died of cancer, she lived with a teacher, the teacher kicked her out because we made the sexy-times, she lived with my grandma, she lost the baby, we graduated, we got on a bus and moved across the country to live with her aunt, and then the short version."

"I've only babysat one time and it was for a friend of my grandparents. All I really had to do was hang out with their 8 year old grandson for a night. Overall it was a pretty cool night. All we did was play 2K and Madden all night so it wasn't bad. 

But anyway, this family wasn't like billionaire wealthy, but wealthy enough to where they left me an envelope with $500 in it and told me whatever I don't spend on food, I can keep. Wealthy enough to have sped off in a Maserati for the dinner they were at. Wealthy enough to have a pool, jacuzzi, and nice BBQ builtin to the backyard out back. You get the idea, they were just an old couple with some money, and they were taking their grandson's parents out to dinner one particular night. Leave me with $500, so I think to myself, I might as well splurge like 30 or 40 bucks on a meal for 2 and pocket the rest. I was like 17 or 18 at the time so I can't say it was a negligible amount of money. Anyway, I take the kid outside to my car across the street, which, at the time, was my older brother's 2005 Toyota Corolla.

He gets in, takes a look around, and goes ""Where's the button that moves the roof back?"" Sorry kid, no convertible here. He tells me that his parent's only have convertible cars and that he's only been in one other car that isn't a convertible, and that ""he isn't my friend anymore.""

I thought that was pretty weird. Throughout the night, he did also make some interesting ""rich kid"" comments, such as asking if we could go to a restaurant that had steak on the menu. He revealed an interesting bit about his parents, saying that they keep talking about bringing him a sister when ""the time is right."" Apparently the kid asked the dad when the right time was and he said when ""mommy stops being afraid.""

I then learned that the kid's mom and dad divorced about a year later. Felt bad. He was a cool kid, didn't really have that shitty spoiled vibe. More like an innocent, curious, steered wrong by his parents vibe."

He had low self confidence and this emo/goth chubby chick started talking to him.  We tried to talk him out of leaving with her but to no avail.  He was back in less than an hour half dressed, wet hair and you could see he had been crying.  Supposedly they got to her single dorm and she had clear plastic bed sheets.  So they start messing around and he's exploring her nervously.  I guess at some point he stratled her and she was playing with his dick while fingering herself.  She then moved her hand up and slid her lubed finger in his ass and it caused him to just shit all over her from being ill to begin with.  He was mortified and jumped off her and then turned around to see her taking his shit and just smearing herself with it.  He tied his shirt around his waist and bolted leaving everything else behind and ran into the dorm showers one floor down to rinse his ass off and then sauntered back to us.

"A terrible car accident happened right around the car I was in last April.

A guy was speeding in his fancy Infinity one way, and the woman behind us (we were turning left on an unprotected left) decided that when we stopped we were being assholes, not making sure we didn't hit anyone. She tried to go around us into oncoming traffic.

Despite his best efforts, Infinity guy swerved out but still hit her. The impact drove his car toward the sidewalk into a pedestrian waiting to cross. I saw him fly behind a taco truck. My girlfriend (at the time) was shocked into nonfunction. I bolted out and check on Infinity guy.

His car was now wedged between the light post and a tree. He swept his side air bags aside and made eye contact, so I let him be. I ran to the Lexus behind us driven by the woman that tried to pass us in oncoming traffic. She was slumped all the way in the passenger seat, which didn't register to me as off at the time (I suspect she either undid her belt afterward or wasn't wearing one). What really stuck out to me at the time was the fact that there was a perfect lipstick kiss on the deployed airbag where she hit it when it went off.

She was confused when I got her talking. She kept asking me how she had gotten there. I told her she was in a car accident. It made no change, she just kept skiing and wanted her phone. I assigned a bystander to just keep asking her questions to keep her engaged and not to let her move.

I ran to check on the pedestrian. He'd been thrown passed a taco truck. There was a security guard performing CPR on him. I asked if I could do anything. He said no. I saw the back of the victim's head. It was...the most upsetting thing is ever seen. He was breathing, but not in any normal way (I'll never forget how his torso was...waving), but the guard kept working on him.

My then girlfriend and I waited for the paramedics and police to arrive. Several witnesses just drove off, including a woman that saw it happen, got out of her car as I did, and called 911 when I told her to. She did, but left right when the first responders got there. Their lives were more important than the dying man.

EDIT: I know having too many people involved would have caused trouble, but having their accounts of what happened felt important to me. A large crowd gathered, but it was so surreal to just see cameras everywhere and no other concern.

We gave our statements. My girlfriend felt ridiculous because she was dressed as a pirate for renn faire. They drove the victim out. They hosed his brain off that asphalt. I felt ill, but was cool headed.

It's stuck with me for a long time. The guy was alive when they picked him up. I saw the memorial a few days later. I talked to his boss the day of-he was just coming back from lunch. A normal forty-something, getting the day done for his kids. I has affected me more deeply that expected. I didn't know him. I don't remember his name. But I've told every insurance adjuster and investigator that's called about it that everyone was behaving irresponsibly, and that I know he didn't deserve to die.

I hope your family is at peace, guy. I couldn't have saved you, but I wish I could have done more.

EDIT: Hey, thanks for the gold, though I've no clue what to do with it. I was a little tipsy when I wrote this, so I apologize for some spelling errors, I fixed them. For a little clarity: my girlfriend was using her blinker. I think what set the woman behind us off was that we moved forward a bit like we were going to turn, but my girlfriend (driving) saw the speeding car coming the other way and hit the brakes. If she hadn't, it would have been me that bore the bring of the crash.

I don't know if anyone was charged. We've had to speak to both insurance companies and several investigators. I suspect we're not done talking about it with people, because the insurance guys said our accounts were needed because the details from the drivers differed considerably (my guess is they both were trying to pin blame on the other). When asked who I thought was responsible, my answer was they both acted irresponsibly, but the woman behind us headed into the incoming lanes and was clearly wrong.

I left out the part where a few other people and I had to wrench the Infinity door open to try to get the guy inside loose. He was bleeding, but otherwise seemed relatively okay.

It also wasn't the first time I witnessed a fatal car accident and had to watch someone die."

"Toxic by Britney Spears is a pop masterpiece. When it came out no one had heard anything like it and it holds up so well still today. But no one really respects Britney so...

edit: Sorry...not to say no one respects Britney but in the pop landscape today, she's not as respected or thought of as a real singer-songwriter/artist like Beyonce, Katy Perry or Gaga or any of the other females that are dominating the charts right now. Aside from Beyonce, these ladies could only hope to have the lasting legacy and endurance Britney has had for 20 years. I know it has a lot to do with her breakdown, the conservatorship and the fact that she doesn't delve deeper into her personal life for her songs like the others do but I personally believe she doesn't want to because of what happened to her and the constant paparazzi. She has decided to keep herself closed off so it doesn't happen again. Hence why most of her music is pretty much ""fluff"" and doesn't really say anything other than party and love me and all that."

"I witnessed a friend die when I was a kid. I have posted this story on Reddit in the past, so forgive me if you have already seen it. 

My friends and I used to play by this creek. My cousins' house backed up to woods and the creek was about a mile deep behind their home. We played by there pretty much everyday during the summer.

One thing we used to do was swing from one side to the other with a swing we made. One day we were swinging and one of our buddies (Josh) slipped. It wasn't super uncommon to slip. You usually just fell in the creek, got wet, and went home and changed later. This time was different. Josh fell backwards and ended up hitting his head perfectly on these large rocks that were by the edge of the creek. The impact was so bad and he was bleeding profusely. My brother jumped in to make sure he didn't drown. I ended up running back to my aunt's house with one of my cousins and a friend. My brother, other cousin, and another friend stayed back. We got help but it was too late by that point.

It was just a freak accident. We fell so many times off that stupid swing and nothing ever happened. He just fell wrong that day and it ended his life. I could hear his parents screams from my aunt's backyard when they got back there. It was awful. I still can't watch movies that involve kids dying and as a dad now, I can't imagine letting your child out to play and then finding out they died. It has made me realize that life is short and accidents can happen anywhere, so it has actually made me less overprotective when it comes to my own kids. That experience changed me as a person. 

Note: This occurred in 1995. For the young ones out there, that was before cell phones were mainstream. I was 11 and we were all in between the ages of 11 and 13, so we probably wouldn't have cell phones even if they were big. Having a phone wouldn't have saved my friend but I figured I should explain why we had to run a mile to get any help.

Around 10 or 11 I found the pleasure of having an orgasm. Pun intended. I was your normal orgasm craving girl monster who just liked to get off. Started with my dads vibrating pen. (Which I am sure mom and dad caught on too, hence why they took it and threw it away) but then one day I stumbled upon my moms vibrator. No, im not talking about a dildo, or little bullet.. it was one of those plug in wands. Seriously the best thing to ever happen to me. I would hide it in the exact same place so she didn't know that I had found it. Except for one time that I decided to take it cause the dummy in me thought ""she probably doesn't use this"" and she came after me asking where it was and as I was getting it out from under my bed I told her that I ""thought it was a muscle massager"". She hid it pretty well after that. Still found it though. Man.. those were the good days.

Also, before you guys ask.. yes.. i cleaned it before and after using.

TL;DR Found my moms dinosaur vibrator and went to town for multiple years because I was a sex crazed teenager.

"Hoo boy, let's see.  Once, in an evil campaign I played a ""bounty hunter"" style character, as a Ranger.  Favored enemies were all humanoids, and I took some feat or prestige class or some other trait from a splatbook(I forget which, this was fifteen years ago) that gave me bonuses for taking trophies from high level victims.  The DM let me do this because he didn't really think there was any way I could abuse it, but he both underestimated me and didn't read closely enough, because the bonuses stacked.

Well, by the end of the campaign every piece of clothing I was wearing was made of some part or other from a sentient humanoid.  Jacket made of human skin(I went with a trenchcoat eventually because I had so much spare material), gloves made of elf skin, necklace of halfing teeth, belt with dwarf beard-scalps hanging off of it, the works.  To him it was like collecting bottlecaps.  

In the end when we retired the campaign and rolled up new stuff, the DM asked me if he could use the character as a recurring villain for future games.  "

"So in another life, I was a Mormon missionary (one of those guys in a suit riding a bike). Well, there are different levels of leadership as a missionary. from the bottom to the top there is Jr. Companion, Sr. Companion, District Leader, Zone Leader, and AP (Assistant to the President) and at the top is some old guy who is the president of your mission. Anyways the power struggle is real to become the AP. If you become AP your family can brag about you SO much more than if you're just a district leader. Anyways at least in my mission under my mission president, he valued tattle tales the most. There are a lot of strict rules as a Mormon missionary. 

Now onto the story. One night I was up a little bit late (our bedtime was 9:30 pm) and was strictly enforced. I was just up reading an unapproved book. I think it was Lord of the rings. Anyways all of a sudden I get a knock on the door at 10 pm. The zone leaders had been peeking into my window and ""caught"" me being an apostate missionary. So to give you some perspective they were up past the curfew and drove over an hour just at the hope that they would bust me breaking a rule. I can only assume my companion told them that I enjoyed reading a little past curfew. 

The next day I get a call from the mission president who asks me to drive to the mission home. He reamed me for over an hour (full on screaming at me) I was just a 19 year old who enjoys reading. Anyways. I'll always remember the time I got in a fuck-ton of trouble over reading a ""non-approved book"" past curfew. "

"It's funny; I knew they had money, but I always saw them as being roughly in the same socio-economic level as my parents and myself. (My wife and I have been married over 20 years, and I work as a software developer, so we're doing okay: paid off mortgage, small nest egg, on track to retire in 15 years or so.)

My mother is the classic narcissist, and has never really liked the fact that we moved across the country or that I got married or that I climbed out of her fucking womb. But I'd ignore her, put up with her making fun of my in-laws, and go on living our life. When we moved was the straw that broke the camel's back, and I cut off contact. (I love my father, but his enabling is a problem.)

Then my inlaws passed, and I got insight into my wife's trust fund. (Okay, first thing: *she has a trust fund?* I mean, I knew they set up some investments into a trust, but I never put two and two together.) 

We're not ""buy a jet and fly around the world drinking champaign"" rich. But at 5% the returns on her investments far exceed what I make as a software developer.

Does my mother know? Fuck, I haven't even told my parents that my inlaws have died. Do I intend to tell them that I'm going to retire and we're going to pick four places a year to travel to? Oh, hell no. 

Do I plan to work with my wife to draft a will so that, after we die, all that money goes back to her side of the family (to her nieces and nephews), as we don't have any kids--and not a dime to my side of the family? Ayyyyup."

"When I practised family law, I often worked with a woman who ran a battered women's shelter. She would attend court to give moral and practical support to some of our clients. There's a lot of waiting around in family court in the UK and so I got to hear a lot of her own story. Her husband had, apparently, been a nightmare of a man. She did always say, though, that she often gave as good as she got.

One day, after she'd had another drunken payday beating, she waited until he was unconscious on the sofa and stole all the money so she could leave him. Before she left, she stripped the mattress sheet off their bed. She took a full-length mirror, laid it down his side of the bed and replaced the sheet. Then, she took a hammer, smashed the mirror to pieces and straightened the sheets again so it wouldn't be visible to her piss-drunk husband when he finally fell onto what was now a bed of broken glass covered by a thin cotton sheet."

"The one time I was on a plane where something bad happened I was amazed by how calm everyone was. We had just taken off and about a minute into the flight there was a huge BOOM. Clearly we had lost an engine. The plane was entirely silent. No one freaked out. Dead calm. I thought to myself ""nah, I'm not dying today"" and just went with it. A few seconds later the captain came on the intercom and said ""Yeah... as you've probably figured out, we lost an engine. No need to worry, these planes are designed to fly on a single engine. We'll be headed back to the airport. Just a heads up, for safety there will probably be fire trucks waiting for us but no need to worry."" It was one of the smoothest landings I'd ever experienced.

Everyone, by default, believes they are exceptional. Everyone is the hero of their own epic narrative.

But the vast majority of people literally do not matter at all in the grand scheme of things. It's an uncomfortable thought, for sure, and we all resist it. Because we want to matter.

And that's why people like sales. Sales make you feel exceptional. *Normally* the price is $x, but *you're* getting 10% off! Doesn't matter that the 350 other shoppers in the store with you have access to the same sale, that's not what you think about. When you get something on sale, you feel good because you're getting something at less than the *normal* price, which means you are getting an *exceptional* price on the item. It confirms what you already believe. You're getting the special and exceptional price, so that must mean *you're* special and exceptional.  You get to brag about how much money you saved to your friends and spouse later. People literally make buying things on sale a major aspect of their personality. It's a point of pride for them. An accomplishment.

So of course JC Penney failed. They fundamentally misunderstood the human mind and the need for people to feel special and exceptional, and the need to feel like they accomplished something when shopping for clothes."

"I ran and ice cream shop. I must have had to say ""Actually, I am the manager"" at least once a week.

My favorite was this woman I eventually banned from the shop. She would come in with her husband and shitty kids. Then she would try to order a large (three scoops) and ask me to put it in three single scoop cups, but only charge for the large.

I said no. You either order three single scoops or you order a large. The difference in cost is quite a bit, but it's fairly standard for companies to do it this way. I wasn't having it. She got pissy that I wouldn't do it. First she said ""Well the manager let me do it last week.""

""No I didn't,"" I told her flatly.

""Well than whoever was working let me do it and they *said* they were the manager.""

""No they didn't. I believe my workers over you.""

""Well I want to talk to the manager.""

""I *am* the manager. You are talking to me. I said no.""

""Fine!"" And she and her little family stormed out without any ice cream. No skin off my back. She was rude to me and my workers, I wasn't going to let her treat us that way.  

Then she proceeds to call the shop the next day, when I am working again (as the manager, I worked a lot.) She said ""Hello, I need to speak to the manager.""

""Speaking. How can I help you?""

""I was in there yesterday and some little bitch *lied* and said she was the manager, but she wouldn't let me get what I wanted...""

""That bitch was me. You're banned from our location. Don't come back.""

Bonus justice boner: She tried to call corporate to report me. Corporate outsources complaints to the manager with the highest rating in the area. Which was me. So when she called corporate to complain about me, she also got me. I wrote up the details of the conversation and forwarded all of her messages to the district manager, and he agreed with my decision and allowed me to send her an email *officially* banning her from the store.

At least that's what I got from the people I talked to. I was homeless for a summer but really I was just a kid having an adventure and I didn't feel good at home. Talking to people whose parents were homeless and had no life skills, or those with addiction who had no support to help them kick it and get back on track, or people who no longer knew how to even begin to find a job scared the shit out of me. I realized that a couple years of that and you would have to work super fucking hard to get out of it. I was never a super fucking hard worker."

I grabbed my smokes and my phone, and when I was about to enter, I threw my smokes and phone into the trash. 

I walked two steps, and said, ""I accidentally just threw my phone away."" I reached into the trash, and with one swipe I was able to grab my phone, and both packs of smokes. The security was too busy paying attention to the line to notice what I had done. I quickly jogged forward, and gave the stranger his smokes back.

"My dad became a felon when I was a kid. For most of my life, he worked odd jobs, built trailer homes, welded, etc. He went back to school and busted his ass to get a degree in diesel mechanics.

He told me the only reason he got the job was because he was off parole and such for more than 10 years.

Basically, you'll have to work hard and do a lot of manual labor. Do what you can to get food on the table, even if that means working temp jobs through Jack-of-All-Trades and mowing people's lawns on the side.

"Handled a divorce between a teacher (wife) and a CVS cashier (husband.) I represented the wife. 

For all intents and purposes, the wife was the breadwinner of the family and she supported herself, her husband, and their two children. I should note: one of the children was severely autistic and required intensive (and expensive) rehab and education. 

During the process of the divorce, the husband (living alone) sued the wife (caring for both children) for temporary spousal support. He met all the statutory guidelines to receive it. But, it just came off as slimy. 

At the day of the hearing, the judge reviewed all of the facts and spent 20 minutes lambasting the husband. He called him a ""vile creature"" that was everything wrong with society. 

The judge then told us that his ""hands were tied"" and that he was forced to grant the spousal support. But he let everyone know how little he thought of the husband. 

As we were leaving the court, the husband just kept saying to my crying client ""Just like Goodfellas - *Fuck you, pay me.*""

It was literally humanity at its worst. "
"Yeah, I was a therapist at a psych hospital for years and it got me really depressed and feeling like normal life was just horrible for people. 

I ended up with a worsening autoimmune condition that left me nearly bed ridden and I quit my job. I ended up staying in a farm house my parent's own, while they travel the country and mostly stay in Florida. 

So with the condition, it's easy to lose most of your social life. I had always been into online gaming, so as my condition worsened I got super into all that. The farmhouse didn't really have Internet and I wasn't willing to shell out big money to get it, so that whole social aspect of my life was gone and I was living outside of a town of 600 people, after moving from a large city. 

I tried to hit up anyone I knew but got nothing, most of my social contact turned into tinder dates and family. 

That was a whole lot of backstory to tell you that I got my immune condition basically in remission but was still stuck out in the woods with very little social contact. Like if I didn't try my hardest to hang with someone, I could go weeks with reddit and Facebook being my only human contact, and it's a shallow social contact. I eventually just gave up and fully embraced the weird hermit in the woods narrative. Isolation is not good for people, that's what every study I've read on it has said. It even fucks with our hormones, but there is something magical that happens when that feeling of loneliness breaks, and it always breaks. 


It builds and builds and builds, then you're suddenly happy to be alone and don't think about it at all. I've noticed it comes in spurts and you could probably track my redditing to see when I had specifically lonely periods. I focused on the woods, archery, gardening, and cooking. And walking, so much walking once I was mobile and worked my way up to it. My hobbies were everything and I did a lot of conservation bullshit in the woods around the farmhouse. I also got to know the animals and would give them treats, and decided the coyotes and red squirrels were my mortal enemies. 


I finally started to feel the urge to work again, not because I wanted to prove something like before but because I wanted to be part of something and I wanted to start helping people again. Kind of one of those, I lost myself and found myself. I'm much less concerned about friends and relationships now. It was so weird when I'd see people though, it was like a drug and was overwhelming. Sometimes I'd even get an adrenaline response, and my arms would start shivering. 


After all that I truly believe we do need to be part of a group, even just a family unit. We need to feel wanted and a part of something though, even when we're in a good place alone. I'm pretty sure my whole connection with animals and the forest were because I needed to be part of something. 


I'll get candid, I hated my life and wanted to die because I was in a lot of pain and had slowly turned negative over the years. I did the usual, therapy antidepressants, and support groups but it just didn't do a lot for me, which is comical because I'm a therapist. Getting in the woods took my life down to the most simple things eat, exercise, sleep and it connected me with this daily nature cycle. Boom, couldn't even remember why the hell I hated my life so much before. It's still scary to look back on. 


""Some feelings sink so deep into the heart that only loneliness can help you find them again. Some truths are so painful that only shame can help you live with them. Some things are so sad that only your soul can do the crying for them.""

"This may not go over well, but here I go

I hated white people growing up. I was told constantly from everybody that hey were the reason why we were stuck in the ghettos. Why we were addicted to drugs. Why we were killing each other. Growing up in inner city Detroit did not help me. When I was a teen I was a part of the gang problem in Detroit. We would find white people who were wondering around and mug them. Most of the time we would beat them up or worse. 

One night though, I got picked up by a cop. This was right around the time of the Ferguson riots, so I was A) scared shitless I was about to be killed and B) Ready to give them a reason to shoot me. The cop who took me, though didn't see me as a violent criminal or a drug addicted welfare drain like I had been taught like how white people saw us. Instead he saw me as a kid who was going down the wrong path. As we were driving back to the station he started talking to me. I did not act very maturely back to him, but eventually he managed to break through. I'll never forget what he said that finally hit me. ""Do you want to become another homicide statistic?""

He ended up sitting with me all night during booking. We talked about everything under sun from Dragonball Z to the role of God in our lives.

Thanks to Officer Danson, I am now working on my criminal justice degree and I hope to be a part of the solution to racial inequality in this country. Instead of another statistic."
"Not totally nsfw but I just this Friday picked up 4 college age guys from a bar around 1:15 AM who were on their way home and teetering on blackout. It was a surge fare of 1.8 and a ride of about 8 miles of mostly highway so I was pretty pumped to make an easy 10-20 bucks in 15 mins. 

We finished the bulk of the ride when the most  intoxicated of the group springs to life and says. ""Dude, you do want Taco Bell?"" I think he mixed a request with a statement that he wanted Taco Bell. I said sure as I wasn't going to be staying out much later and thought it was sure to yield a tip in cash. So I take them to a little plaza that contains a gas station, a convenience store, and of course Taco Bell. 

This is when that same guy sprung to life once again to say. ""No drive thru, let's go in."" I told him no but he said he'd give me 10 dollars if I waited so I reconsidered. They step out of the car and this guy huddles his friends for a few seconds before they break off into three different directions as the drunkest guy half slumps and leans against my back bumper; one rushes the Taco Bell and returns with four 5 dollar boxes, another hits the gas station and comes back with white owl cigarillos. When the final man returns it's with a roll of paper towels, some sort of rivet things, and sticky tack. The drunk guy then unravels the entire roll and shoves it into one of the barf bags that I keep in my back seat and they get into car for the last 3/4 of a mile home.

Drunk guy is fiddling with it in the back as I talk with the guys about sports and other banalities until I pull up to the house they live in about two minutes later. As I pull in the drunk guy says. ""Done!"" And then slumped onto his buddy's shoulder. He hands me 10 dollars and grabs the bag containing the paper. He looked me right in the eye and with an incredibly serious tone he broke through his intoxicarion for one sentence and said ""you must always remember to recycle"" and then passed out to the point that his friends had to carry him

I then got to see what this blacked out genius was up to, a device for smoking multiple blunts that was so precisely made (holes were equidistant, lines were clean, etc). They invited me in to test it but I had to be on my way. As I drove off I wondered what this person would be like in the light of day. What does a sober version of this stoner engineer do, what else is he capable of?

Tldr: I picked up a drunk quartet and was party to a blacked out, stoner engineering master class and received a stern reminder to always recycle. Favorite fare of all time."

It was pitch black, and we were trying to keep our lights off. I kept hearing human footsteps, coming from almost random directions. After getting sufficiently uncomfortable, I heard a voice that sounded like it was maybe 10 feet behind me.

""Hey, lawlessSyntax."" in my hunting partner's voice. I smelled the smell of coffee and marlboro reds.

I replied ""Sup?"" but got no response.  I flicked my lighter but didn't see anyone in the area.

After saying that a couple times, I shouted for my hunting partner, he called back from what sounded like a quarter mile away.

It started raining in the distance and heat lightning would occasionally illuminate the field. I saw a tree that looked like a human figure. After a few moments it wasn't there. More footsteps around me.

After a while when the sun just started to faintly show, I decided to take a break and was getting a bit creeped out, so I walked the quarter mile to my hunting partner's tree stand to ask him what he wanted.

He said that he hadn't left his spot, and didn't walk up to me at any time in the morning."

She's been sitting on her lard ass the whole day eating our oreos and potato chips, so I say screw it and dump the box in the middle of the hall way and start building.

"""I don't think you're an appropriate friend for my children."" I was 12. It was my best friend's mom. I had been friends with him and his sister since we were 4. We lived in a relatively upperclass area at the time and, although my friend was really cool, his parents were really snobbish. I got that line right after my mom had to sell her business because of a divorce. I wasn't allowed to come over, they weren't allowed to speak to me, and that was around the time they started homeschooling so I didn't even get to see them at school anymore. All because my family fell out of a social class they felt was necessary for their children's friends to be a part of.

"At my old job I began training for a position that involved way more responsibility than my old one.

Instead, the offered nothing and said if I didn't want the job, then to not take it. I waited until I was trained and the guy training me quit (that's why I was taking over the position), then I walked off the job. They wanted to fuck me, so I fucked them, hard. "
"Not 100% what OP asks but the area where it happened made it all the more creepier given what unfolded. 

I like going for walks at night sometimes because I dislike people but I've been trying to get into shape for a while now. So night time is great! 

For that I have a route through some fields which are surrounded by cities and even Highways. One major cities skyline is clearly visible from the paths I take on a normal day/night. Sometimes however we get really thick fog because of a mountain range. 

One night I was out for a walk and super thick fog hit. It was fun at first. I couldn't even see the end of the light cone from my headlamp and barely saw one foot in front of the other walking my familiar path. Usually you'd hear the sound of the Highway close by since it's very busy all day and night. But at some point I noticed I didn't hear it anymore. As a matter of fact, I didn't hear anything but myself. There wasn't even wind. Mind you I was in an open field, no trees to obstruct the wind and there's usually always some.

Knowing the area well I just decided to keep on with my path and soldiered on. After a while I heard a sharp whistling. That in itself isn't too weird. People walk their dogs a lot in those fields and it was far away. However the whistling continued to sound through the night and it seemed to get louder and closer. It was somewhat melodic after a while, more like a song than someone trying to catch the attention of a dog or person.

The really weird part was that it came from the direction of the open and very muddy fields while it got closer and closer. Sure you could walk there but you'd make plenty of noise and probably lose a shoe or two trying to wade through that mess. 

I tried ignoring it but it creeped me the hell out. So I kept on walking, slowly getting cold despite walking up hill and faster than usual. 

The whistling kept up and out of the corner of my eye I could sometimes make out a silhouette illuminated by my bobbing headlamp.

That's when I started to really freak out. I live in Germany and we have a tale around here of the ""Nebelpfeifer"" which basically just translates to Fog Whistler(s). There've been some historic accounts of them, with one of the major ones happening during the 30 year war, where a small village close by Düsseldorf in 1622 was surrounded by heavy fog over night. Whistling was heard all around throughout the night and on the next day more than a dozen people were missing, never to be found again.

It's said that Nebelpfeifer try to lure unsuspecting victims closer. If you can whistle their favorite tune you might survive. If not, they'll devour you. They'll stay right at the edge of how far you can see into the fog and never come any closer. They also only really stalk people who are out and about alone, unless there's dire times like during many of the wars in Europe as mentioned above.

Remembering that freaked me right the hell out and I basically speed walked/ran home. 

Only experienced it once and probably got the best workout of my life, too. Wouldn't recommend it though. These days when fog hits I turn on my heel and head back home to work out another day. I'm not great enough of a fool to meddle with stuff like this."

Now I didn't want to get stabbed, so I reached back towards my wallet and suddenly a burning rage came over me and instead of grabbing my wallet, I uppercut the guy. He stumbled backward and I start beating the shit out of the guy until he was on the floor and not going to get up. I then ran the rest of the way home (about 2 blocks) and when I got there I realized I had one of his teeth stuck in my hand.

I was hiking some pretty fantastic trails with my dog and her hair started standing up, and she started making a barely audible growl and looking around in the woods frantically and she was stuck to me like glue.   
I didn't see anything, but decided to head back anyway.   
The whole time my dog was on high alert and I just kept talking to her loudly, but I could feel my own adrenaline spiking and started getting really paranoid and felt like someone was watching me. I was pretty convinced I was going be murdered so I started walking faster, but not running.   
We were nearing the entrance when I saw my dog freeze and stare intently into the woods. I followed her gaze and there was a mountain lion, slightly crouched and looking right at us. I never realized how fucking big those things are, and my stomach dropped. I backed away while facing it the rest of the way into the parking area. It didn't move so I backed the rest of the way to my car, got my dog and myself in, and just sat there.   
I called the DEP to let them know there was a mountain lion in the area.... all they said was I must've misidentified a deer because there's no mountain lions in our state. They acted like I reported seeing Bigfoot.   "

"Back when I was fat and my little sister was in grade school, I went to visit my family and she wrote me a bunch of notes to take with me back home. Among them was one that read ""don't forget to lose wate!"" (sic)

At the time I was kind of hurt but she was right, I needed to lose weight. And I did, so thanks for the reminder you little shit. Lol. "

"Oh god yeah. Also, inappropriate footwear, yes? When I went with my family to AZ last summer tons of tourists (mostly Asian) were wearing strappy sandals or kitten heels on the trails. It's like, did you not realize where you were going today when you got in your car???"
"How has no one said Illinois yet?  Oh, right..."
I'd say no and then be worried the billionaire is going to stage my death and take my heart. Luckily stress of this and starting a high cholesterol diet might ruins their chances. Then I'm offered by a sympathy group to get a bomb strapped to my heart so they can never kill me without risking the heart. I agree yet as the operation is about to start I realize it's the billionaire in a fake moustache and this is just a ploy to steal my heart. I run out the hospital in a gown for a exciting roof top chase against a helicopter. Now cornered it looks like I'm doomed until the child has a change of heart and asks his dad to let him die in a heartwarming speech. The dad refuses so the child crashes the helicopter they're in.

"I'm going to go with John Glenn. Guy starts out as a fighter pilot in WW2 and fucks shit up in the Pacific, then decides he wants to become a test pilot once the war is over. He gets to test out a bunch of wild shit for the military, and even though he already has a job most can only ever dream of, he decides it's not good enough. What's better than being a test pilot? Being an astronaut, and one of the first men in space. John Glenn remains an astronaut for a while, but it's taking up a lot of time, and he doesn't get to spend much time with his wife (who was his childhood sweetheart from the age of 4), so he leaves space to become a FUCKING SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES. Because he hasn't served his country enough yet. While senator, he is partially responsible for starting an initiative that dramatically increased the safety of the US nuclear arsenal, and he had a reputation for being a fair man willing to compromise. So he kicks it in DC for a while, but eventually he realizes he misses that whole space thing. So what does John Glenn do? He starts hounding NASA to let him back into space. NASA is like ""are you kidding? Dude. You're like 70"" to which he replies ""then send me up there for fucking 'geriatric studies,' I don't care. I'm going to space again."" Eventually, realizing that this motherfucker will probably build himself a rocket if they keep saying no, NASA lets him fly into space at over 70 years old as a crew member on a space shuttle, making him the oldest person to ever go to space. Finally satisfied with his life, in which he was one of the most badass Americans ever, he dies at home in Ohio, leaving behind his wife of over 50 years.

This guy had the coolest life of anyone I've ever read about, and I haven't even talked about the way he stood up for his wife (who had a severe stutter) or his best friend (a Holocaust survivor). He did cool shit, he was honorable, and he was kind. John Glenn is the ultimate American badass."

I can't even imagine this. In my house if you are hungry you just eat. My kids aren't allowed to use the stove alone yet but they can use the toaster or the microwave or whatever. If it's like half an hour till supper I ask them to wait. But that's it. And my kids are both very slim.  We only have healthy food in the house.... so go nuts. 
"When I was 8 or so, we lived on the third floor of an apartment building.

There was broken wood everywhere. I thought he was dead. I almost died.  Good news my dad lived, but his legs are messed up. It was the closest I have ever been to dying and I thought I was watching my dad die. "

"1. **The Classic: beans + rice + garlic powder + salt.** Buy rice in bulk, buy dried beans or the large cans. Rice keeps in the fridge for about a week, you can cook as much as you think you'll eat in advance. Pro-tip: to reheat microwave the rice alone and then add the beans cold, beans change texture in the microwave.
2. **The White-People Classic: pasta + cheese and/or butter and/or olive oil and/or tomato sauce.** Pasta does not store pre-cooked as well as rice, but stored covered in an air-tight container with no sauce (but with a light drizzle of oil) it can last a few days. If it's gotten dry and you're going to eat it anyway, add butter or olive oil, reheat it, *then* add other toppings.
3. **The Payday Special: tortilla + cheese + beans.** If it really is payday add some avocado to replenish all those nutrients you never get. Can be prepared as either a tostada (toast the tortilla until golden-brown and crispy, 9 minutes exactly in my toaster oven but YMMV, add toppings) or a quesadilla (put tortilla on your skillet/griddle/frying pan, set burner to medium-low, cut/shred and add the cheese to one side of the tortilla, put any other toppings on top of the cheese when it melts, fold the topping side over onto the empty side, eat).
4. **The My-Fridge-is-Empty-but-I'm-Still-Mexican: beans + sour cream + hot sauce + salt.** Just put it in a bowl. Add cheese I guess but if you're making this you probably ran out already.
5. **The I'm-Sure-Someone-Makes-This-on-Purpose: rice + fried egg + salt.** Fry an egg, make rice, put fried egg on the rice. If you wanna get really fancy you can also fry the rice and mix it all together but that takes time and then you have Fried Rice and suddenly you have all the associated pressure to add ""flavor,"" whatever that is.

"I help out at a convenience store close to where I live in Chicago. Heroin is a serious issue here. There is one fella named Dan who pops in every now and then. Last year his wife died from heroin-related complications. I remember seeing him the night of her death. He had been clean for a couple of months up until that point. Their story was that they were both alcoholics from a different state, and moved to Chicago, and got hooked on dope. Anyway, that night he was having a beer and was obviously very sad. I talked to him for about 15 minutes. He went on his way, started shooting up again for a few months. He would come to the store sometimes when he was high. He was clearly struggling. Now, I've dealt with enough dope fiends to know how manipulative they can be, and I know what angles they work. But he would just come in to be warm and talk. I would buy him a muffin and a coffee and let him hang out. He never bothered anyone and never, not once, asked for money. 

Fast forward to the beginning of 2017. Guy is doing great, aside from being homeless. He has been clean for 6 months, has a job (though not consistently) through an outreach program. He still
begs down the block, so he often pops in just to talk. He has such a good heart and I really hope he makes it. I recently got married and the people covering for me told him. He came in about a month later (when I was back from our honeymoon) and said congrats, and we talked, and it was all nice. I told my wife about how he somehow, despite all of his problems and stresses, remembered to pop in to say congrats. I was excited when she was in the store at the same time and finally got to meet him.

Idk what the point of this story was, I always wanted to tell it. The story doesn't have an ending yet, but I hope it's a happy one for Dan.

I did however eat pineapple pizza more than once, though, and enjoyed it.


Anyways. Back in elementary school, maybe grade 5 when I was 11 years old. There was this girl in my class that I had the biggest crush for maybe 3 years. 



One day, the class goes for a field trip, but forgetful ol' me forgot to get my field trip form signed, so unfortunately I was unable to go. The teacher just had me stay inside the class the entire time doing work or whatever he made me do to pass the time. I was alone. 



It was at this age I had discovered masturbating and was a horny little shit.



 I looked to my left, the door was closed. I looked to my right, the door was closed. Perfect, both doors are closed. I walked over to my crush's desk, and searched inside her bag just out of sheer, creepy curiosity. Inside, I found a pair of pink underwear, possibly what she had worn for gym class. I cringe every time I think about this... I used those panties on my dong. Right inside that very classroom. I wrapped it around my little boy wee-wa, and went to town with it. To make matters worse, I got super into it, taking off my pants completely, and just lying down on the desks that were set up side by side, masturbating with this girl's underwear. Looking back at it, I am so thankful nobody walked into that room because, holy fuck, wouldn't that be a sight to see - some kid, butt ass naked on top of the desks jerking off with a pair of pink undies.



I didn't orgasm, but I did get a visible amount of pre-cum on her underwear. When I decided I had enough, I put it back into her backpack, zipped it up like nothing ever happened, and sat down at my desk to continue doing whatever it was I was doing.



So yeah. That happened.




TL;DR: Stayed behind in class during a field trip, masturbated with crush's underwear.

"Not a lawyer but got divorced. During divorce proceedings, when we didn't live together anymore, my wife filed a frivolous police report saying that I 'threatened' her. In the police report, she wrote my apartment's address as her place of residence. A court immediately issued a restraining order against me, prohibiting me from being in my apartment (that I rented).

While the restraining order was active (several months) I had to live in hotels and Airbnbs, which of course is 2x-3x of normal rent, without having access to my clothes and other stuff. I also was paying the rent for the apartment that was empty all that time (she never actually went there during that restraining order, even though she claimed it as her residence). 
 The restraining order was lifted as the case was dismissed after she never provided any evidence or even testimony to DA.

I didn't sign lease extension in time during this process because I had no information how long the restraining order will be for; even though it was lifted right before my lease expired, I ended up having to move (and pay a broker fee).

Of course this also delayed divorce proceedings because we couldn't communicate while the restraining order was active.

Besides that, she refused to sign tax form for ""married filing jointly"". I ended up filing as ""married filing separately"", which meant quite a few thousand dollars extra in payment to IRS.

This was the biggest case of 'fuck you over without any gain for me' that I have seen."

"I was just at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas last weekend.

Now granted, like most european beaches and topless pools, about 80% of the topless chests are the kinds you don't want to see (septuagenarians love sunbathing apparently).  Ever so often though a fit, firm 20 year old will walk around topless....and that's when security has to go to work.
I saw the Caesars Palace staff walk over to the same cabana bed literally five times and be asked to show their phone's photo app.  They kept getting caught taking pics (and they were pretty blatant about it).  I was surprised security let them off 4 times before finally kicking them out.
I then saw them warn like 16 other groups of guys within the span of an hour.  Again, you'd think this would be great - seeing the occasional supermodel-looking woman disrobing.  Nope - you gotta maintain ""tough guy frame"" and deal with drunk dude-bros most of the time."

"Sorry, I love history and hypothetical ""what-if's"" scenarios and I seriously doubt the US would have dropped the atomic bomb on Germany...for several reasons. 

In May, 1943 (before we successfully tested the A-bomb) a group composed of General's Groves, Vannevar Bush, James B. Conant, Admiral William Purnell, and Major General Wilhelm Styer had the discussion of WHERE they should strike with the A-Bomb when it was completed. 

""The point of use of the first bomb was discussed and the general view appeared to be that its best point of use would be on a Japanese fleet concentration in the Harbor of Truk. General Styer suggested Tokyo but it was pointed out that the bomb should be used where, if it failed to go off, it couldn't be easily salvaged. The Japanese were selected as they would not be so apt to secure knowledge from it as would the Germans."" 

Dropping a ""dud"" atomic weapon was a very real possibility even after the first successful nuclear test. Germany would recover that weapon and develop their's way faster, where-as the Japanese did not have that capability. 

The US would not risk dropping the bomb on Germany, espeically if the conventional fire-bombings from planes were doing exactly what we wanted to do way more tactically too. "

"Getting solar panels on your house by lease or ""power purchase agreement"" is a horrible deal for a homeowner. You save a small amount on your bill, but are tied to the agreement for 20+ years while the company that actually owns them retains all of the tax benefits.

Edit: It's not ""free"" - you pay for the power the system produces, albeit usually at a lower rate. However, the savings are just as good with many solar oriented loans that require no money upfront in which the homeowner retains the 30% federal and any state tax incentives.

Edit 2: Solar panels have no moving parts. The ""maintenance"" portion of a PPA is virtually negligible as the equipment will be warrantied as is the workmanship if you just buy it. I will concede that it doesn't make sense to buy if you don't have a tax liability."
"Here in South Florida...

If you are surrounded by a bunch of small, pastel colored one-story houses with shallow roofs all lined up side-by-side in a row with no cul-de-sacs, you might be in the ghetto."
"Felt like I should make a new account for this.

I frequently go bushwalking all throughout the Blue Mountains (NSW, Australia) and have done since I was a kid with my dad. Sometimes for shorter walks I go alone. Yeah, that could be dangerous, and as a woman, I could have added risk of being attacked or whatever. But I carry a couple of knives with me so I don't really feel threatened. And always bring a satellite phone. I just love and crave that feeling of being entirely surrounded by the bush.

Anyway, around ~5 years ago I thought it would be a good idea to do an overnighter walk by myself. Shit idea. The walk was fine, 3 or 4 groups of people came by the other way on the first day. Picked a little area to stay overnight towards dusk. Cut a few ferns back and I had a space to stick my little one person tent. I was maybe 30 metres from the track, mostly out of sight behind trees and such.

The usual wildlife noises were going on as I drifted to sleep, though there was a strange noise - I can only describe it as a ""bounding"" sound, like somebody was sprinting through the bush right past me. But it went by WAY too fast with too few steps to carry a person that distance. Also if you've ever seen the bush in this part of Australia you'd know there isn't much ""space"" on the ground to walk freely if you're off the track. You have to at least wade through bushes/ferns etc. [Kind of like this](https://danielwalkerphoto.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/djw1257.jpg) So you can't exactly sprint full speed without eating shit. I felt a bit uneasy but thought it's probably just stuff falling from a tree or whatever.

Next morning I had brekky and packed up my things, and kept going along the track. Passed a couple of people going the other way, then was alone again for maybe half an hour. Then I heard the sound of a stick being broken (like from someone stepping on it). The sound came from behind me and to my left, away from the track. I turned around to look and nearly fucking died on my feet.

A fair distance into the bush was something standing there and looking directly at me. I wanted to believe it was a person but it wasn't. I can't judge the exact height but it was obviously *very* tall, I'd guess 9ft. Its skin was dark-grey or brownish. It had a horrifically large head with huge black eyes. I couldn't see a mouth or anything. Its arms and legs were really long.

I was almost crying, tears welled up in my eyes. Completely frozen, staring at this creature, it was like my legs were locked in position. The longer the stare went on between me and the creature I had this ever heightening feeling of absolute dread, like nothing I'd ever felt before. The fear built up until I could see my heartbeat in veins in my vision, and I suddenly bolted. I SPRINTED away, continuing on the track. I ran and ran and was too scared to look behind me. Tears were streaming from my eyes as I was running away. I didn't stop until I actually caught up with some people going the same direction as me.

They looked at me and were saying ""Oh my god are you alright?"" I was fucked from running so hard for so long. I told them I saw ""something"" in the bush and asked if I could walk with them the rest of the way.

It took me 6 months but I did start bushwalking again, but I never go alone these days, lol. You couldn't pay me to do it.

TL;DR saw probably an alien in the Australian bush.

Edit: The reason I say ""alien"" is because it didn't seem to have any fur, and was more lanky/thin than I'd expect a giant mammal to be. Basically looked like a stretched out human with a greatly enlarged head and eyes. Though the body proportions still looked ""off"" compared to a human, especially the length of the arms."

"A few years ago, I was driving across the country and stopped at [Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=415) to camp for the night.  I got in about 4PM and, eager to experience the redwoods for the first time, started out on a ~ 7 mile trail run through the park.  This was early November so I knew I had about 1.5 hours until sunset, which I thought was plenty of time for the run.

If you've been to the redwoods, you know the terrain is steep, narrow valleys and (of course) unfathomably giant trees.  Twilight came early and my pace slowed as the light dwindled.  Soon I was walking, just barely able to discern the path.  This was the start of a ""situation"", but I knew that I would be warm enough if I kept moving, so I concentrated on staying on the path and absorbing the forest's presence.  It was incredibly quiet (I perhaps heard one or two juncos call the whole time), but not spooky.  For lack of a better term, I got a sense of peaceful dignity that existed entirely separate from my human-sized concerns.

With maybe 2 or 3 miles left in my walk/run back to the campsite, I rounded a bend and came upon a silvery, glowing orb right in the middle of the trail.  I held my eyes closed (was this a trick of my night vision in the fading twilight?) but the orb was still there when I opened them.  After staring at it for some amount of time I cautiously stuck my hand into it.  I didn't feel anything, though I half-expected to the sensation of heat or maybe a tingling, but I distinctly remember how the details of my hand appeared in that silvery light.  I traced the outline with my hands, but couldn't bring myself to step through it.
 
Eventually I grew cold and realized I needed to continue.  As I was looking for a way around it, I saw the moon just peaking above the ridge.  That's when I realized what it was: I had been playing with a moonbeam that disappeared into the depths of the steep valley.  The terrain and rising moon had created a sort of illusion that made it look like a glowing orb was floating in the middle of the trail.  It was beautiful, but explainable.

That said, I will always hold onto how I felt upon rounding the bend and seeing that orb.  It wasn't fear, just a keen sense of my surroundings and a sudden openness to experiencing something incredibly beautiful, even if it defied my understanding of the world."

"There's an ounce of weed in the carcass of my PS2. My dad moved it to the attic last year, and I can't think of any justification for going up there that won't make him suspicious (he knows it's broken).

Also, if he goes up there he might see that I replaced one of his Krugerrands with a chocolate coin the last time I went up.

edit: okay, I've had a lot of fun with this post, but the number of psychologically damaged fuckwits misinterpreting it is getting tedious now.

I don't live with my dad. I rent my own place and visit home a couple of times a year, during which he and I have a lot of fun playing pranks on one another. I'm not a 'drug addict' who habitually steals from him, I'm a highly trained, well-funded scientist who doesn't have any financial worries whatsoever, thankfully.

I could totally claim back the weed if I was that bothered about it, but while I'm 90% sure my dad wouldn't give a fuck, it seems like my habit from  7 years ago isn't really worth bringing up.

The krugerrand I took is literally about 9 feet from where it originally was. I took it because my family have played pranks on one another for my whole life, and I know that when my dad sees the note I left him he'll laugh.

So it's like 2 hours before the paper's due and I get home from work, go to make a final check over what I did and see that this guy had rewritten everything - and it's goddamned awful. Typos everywhere, sentence fragments, run-ons, you name it. It was hardly legible. So I take the entire paper and rewrite it AGAIN, this time keeping more of what everyone else wrote and fixing all the errors.

Dude has the gall to complain to the professor about me, said I hijacked the project and deleted all his work (I didn't, I left his section in) and blah blah blah. Nothing ever really came of it and I still passed the class with a perfect score, but goddamn if that didn't make me salty."

"This is the most disturbing thing I have read on this thread. One wishes that it wasn't possible to mentally manipulate children like this, but unfortunately cases like this are all too common. What Tammy #2 did is a particularly vicious form of child abuse,  convincing her children that their father could do something so horrible to them. The woman is a narcissistic sociopath and I hope that one day your step dad's biological children will recognize this. I am happy that he has you and your mother in his life, and I hope he is grateful for the love and support I assume you and your mother have shown him. The fact that he was willing to give his heart and affection to another woman after what happened is mind blowing.

It's ridiculous that they traveled here without appropriate attire, but those rules are definitely driving the market. You see them for sale outside of every temple."

My little sister is an arrogant little asshole and was in a shitty phase where she thought she could just barge into anyone's room at light speed for whatever stupid reason she had. Well you can imagine what happens next when you consider my door had no locks. 

We're doing the dirty, missionary, completely nude with no covers over us. My sister like the idiot she is barges in and before she can finish her first sentence just screams ""oh my god!"" 

I immediately jumped out from my girlfriend in a panic leaving her spread eagled and completely exposed for my sister to see. It all happened so fast because of how quickly she likes to barge in that we really couldn't cover up. She stuttered a bit with a stunned look and walked out the door. Right after I hear my mom laugh from her room knowing what just happened. She gave my sister a hard time about not knocking and needless to say, she cut that bad habit right then and there. "

My main passions are learning languages and writing. If I tell a guy (or anyone for that matter) that I write, 9 times out of 10, the follow up question is ""Oh, can I read some of what you've written?""

"Someone tried to kidnap me when I was in 7th grade, if that counts.

I was walking home from the bus stop (a little over half a mile/about 1km) on a chilly November day in suburbia when a minivan pulls up alongside me and the driver, a guy I had never seen before who looked to be in his mid-50s, rolls down his window, asking me if I wanted a ride.  I said no, and he insisted, rolling his car alongside me as I continued to walk.  I remember he called me ""little girl"" which was weird to me because I had hit puberty at, like, age 9 and was always getting mistaken for a high schooler, but the catholic school uniform might have made me look younger, idk.  He kept this up until I said, ""I'm not going with you, please leave me alone.""  At that point he pulled into a driveway in front of me to block me and another guy, probably in his early 20s, opened the door and started jumping out toward me.

Of course, this was before everyone had cell phones so I couldn't call the police or anything, just run as fast as I could away from them while screaming ""Help, please!"" and hoping it would scare them off.  I ended up cutting through the park on that street and zigzagging my way through backyards to get to my house.  

Turns out the guy was a registered sex offender who lived a few streets away from my bus stop.  My dad filed a police report, but we never heard anything back about it.  There were younger kids (and my younger siblings) who usually were there with me, so I'm not sure what would have happened if they had been there that day: would the men still have tried to take someone, or would they have been intimidated by the group?

3.  He drove himself $75,000 into debt taking care of his father who refused to hold down a job despite being perfectly capable of doing so.  He was living hand to mouth while enabling his dad to live in a lovely apartment (and then paying to move him when he got kicked out of that apartment), buying him expensive food, alcohol and cigarettes.  He would then get stressed and smoke and lie to me about his smoking.  At this point, I was older and starting to think about marriage and having kids some day and realized that I didn't need someone with that kind of baggage.

"We dated for a few weeks and then the night came to get down. 

Since having sex doesn't happen often for me, I don't typically keep a condom in my wallet or on my person. She says she wants to fuck and I tell her ""I don't have a condom."" to which she replies ""It's fine."" Being the horny none thinker I was I got to work.  As I'm ready to cum I start pulling out. She grabs my hips and pulls me back inside her and says ""In me!"" and of course, that being the hottest thing I've ever heard a woman say to me, I finish inside her.

A few weeks go by and she tells me she's late and to be prepared to be a father. Not the most ideal situation but I put myself in it, I'm going to see it through. Another two days go by and she's in tears. I ask what the matter was and she said she got her period. I looked confused and she yelled, ""I wanted to have a child with you and it didn't work and now we have to try again!""

I've never ghosted someone so fast in my life."

Less than 10 yards at that point. Going back to the car is quick, because im more scared now, lean in the drivers window and grab the phone off the center console. Dial and no service at all.

"My dad worked at PetSmart for a short time when he was offered a good amount of money to be a department manager. He probably came home with ten different lizards and I believe 3 hamsters during his time working there. Why? They would be shipped to the store and sit in their shopping containers until a space on the floor opened up for them. If they received five bearded dragons that they didn't mean to order, they'd sit in the back and die of whatever killed them first. Dehydration, starvation, heat stroke. My dad would secretly take some of them home so they wouldn't be left for dead, and his coworkers cared so little for the animals in the back that they were never missed. We got some good pets out of it, and he complained all the way up to corporate before he left. He stayed just to complain. Nothing was done. Fuck PetSmart.

Edit: Blah blah this really blew up, didn't it. Just wanted to say, I don't believe many stores pull shit like this. But please always do your research and be open to fostering and adopting animals."

This story has me screaming in my head.
"I went to college in Minneapolis and worked at a convenience store across the street from my apartment. One day these two Japanese girls brought a bunch of ice cream to my counter and we talked for a bit. I found out that they were visiting  from Osaka and disliked the girl they were crashing with because she was boring, so I invited them out to see a local band at First Avenue. We ended up having a great time and went back to my place to party more. My friend Mike who was with us went home eventually and the girls jumped on me as soon as I locked the door. We hooked up and the whole time I was in disbelief because for a white guy, having a threesome with two Japanese girls is cartoon-level bucket list. Also, having a threesome wasn't as intimidating as I had always thought. 

I had just thrown out all of my furniture including a couch and bed because some asshole put a great looking couch riddled with bed bugs by the dumpster with no sign and I unknowingly brought it up to my apartment.  We had all crashed in a pile of blankets and sleeping pads after fooling around. I was worried that in the morning I would have to explain to the girls and they would run away, grossed out, but they were totally cool and understanding. They hated the girl they were supposed to be staying with so much that they ended up bringing all their luggage down to my place to stay with me i my unfurnished apartment. They stayed the rest of their time in Minneapolis with me and cleaned my apartment, bought me booze and cooked delicious Japanese stew for me.

I offered to drive them to the airport as it was the least I could do. On the way to the highway, one of them made me pull over at a furniture store and BOUGHT ME A DAMN FUTON BED.  

Best thing that happened to me in college. If you're out there, thank you Minami &amp; Nao!"
"I have a good friend who is on ""The Board"" of his association. He is also a trained mediator and a really good guy. The Board is only 3 people, basically because no one else wants to put up with anyone else complaining.

"Biscuits are really easy. I usually eyeball the recipe since I've done it a few times but the first time you'll want to measure. I'll give volumetric measures since that is what my recipe called for but ill toss in weights based on the internet, I can't endorse the weights as correct though.

Get a bowl, put in

* 3 cups (361g) all purpose flour
* 6 tablespoons (85g) of cold butter, shortening, or lard (butter tastes best IMO but all taste fine)

Work the flour and butter with your hands, a fork, or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles damp sand. Add to this mixture

* 1 tablespoon (12g) white sugar
* optionally up to 3 more tablespoons (38g) of white sugar, if you want them to be sweet, maybe with jam as a dessert
* 1 tablespoon (14g) of baking powder (not baking soda. Other recipes use baking soda and buttermilk, this one does not. Also, some recipes call for 'self-rising flour' which is just all purpose flour with baking powder in it)
* 1 teaspoon (5g) of salt

Stir to combine. Okay, now you are going to add some milk. The exact amount depends on humidity and other factors, so start with a little less, and feel free to add extra. You are aiming for a dough that isn't dry and crumbly, but isn't so wet as to stick to everything and refuse to stay together. Its a dough, not a batter.

* 1 cup (227 g, 0.25l) milk, or other dairy (cream is tasty!)

Mix the dough until it has the right consistency, try not to overmix it though.

Okay, now you get a large surface, like a clean countertop, dust with flour, and dump the dough onto it. Flatten it out into a rectangle 3/4 inch (uhh... 2cm) thick, fold in 3rds like a letter, flatten again, fold again, then flatten one more time. Now punch out circles, or cut squares (we have round 'biscuit cutters' with graduated sizes, you can use a glass in a pinch if you want round biscuits and don't have anything approrpriate). This recipe aims to make ~12 biscuits, so you can choose the size appropriately, feel free to make fewer jumbo biscuits or more small biscuits though. When you have gotten all you can out of the rolled out dough, form the remains into a ball, pat it back down to 3/4 inch, and cut/punch more. When all you have is a few scraps, you can eat them or bake them too.

Place the biscuits on a baking sheet (if the sheet is clean and the biscuits have enough fat in them they shouldn't stick, but if you are concerned about it, feel free to grease the baking sheet). You want the biscuits touching so they can help each other rise nice and tall, but don't smoosh them together, just place them touching. Brush the tops with cream or melted butter, and bake at.. uh... shit. Bake at 400F until the tops are golden brown. Thats... 200C? It should take around 15 minutes but ovens vary. Don't let the bottoms burn, you want a golden top but its better to have a pale top and a golden bottom than a golden top and a black bottom.

The biscuits should rise significantly, and be soft and steamy inside. Eat immediately or allow to cool slightly. They are delicious on their own, but they are even better with honey, jam, or butter spread on them. If you want to go full 'Murica...

Get a frying pan and warm it up on the stovetop. Once it is heated, add 

* 1lb (450g) of loose breakfast sausage (breakfast sausage in the US is typically made with some combination of salt, pepper, sage, thyme, rosemary, red pepper flake, and a little brown sugar. In this situation it is not in a sausage casing)

To the pan and cook, breaking up, until it is all brown and the fat is rendered. Then, push the meat to one side of the pan, tilt the pan to collect most of the fat on the open side, and sprinkle it with 

* 2 tablespoons (17g) of all purpose flour

Stir the sausage grease and flour mixture and let it cook until it is a light tan color (this is essentially a sausage roux). Now you are going to be adding milk while stirring, you want to dissolve the roux in the milk to make a thick milk gravy. Add

* 2 cups (0.5l) milk, but add more if you feel it is too thick
* salt to taste
* black pepper to taste
* optionally add a couple drops of ~~Worcester~~ worcestershire sauce

Stir and let bubble until thick and tasty. Add milk if it is too thick for you.

Take fresh biscuits, split them open length-wise, and spoon sausage gravy over them. Enjoy your delicious bowl of carbs and fat.

"I'm a freelance copywriter. I write for small businesses - web content, brochures, fliers, welcome letters, etc. Here are my suggestions for making it to a decent income: 

1) Start small, i.e. cheap and maybe for people you already know who are willing to give you a shot. (Cheap doesn't mean free.) Even if you've done plenty of other writing, you need experience copywriting specifically because it really is its own skill. You need to be really good at it, comfortable working with clients, and confident in your skills, before you expand to strangers you charge decently. 

2) Craft a great elevator speech - 10-15 seconds that explains what you do, why they need it, and how you do it differently from everyone else. Sound friendly and casual, not stuffy and formal. This happens to be exactly what I do for the businesses, so I really need to nail this part. I've gotten reallllly good at it and I can see their eyes light up. ""Oh wow! I have so much trouble with that! That's just what I need!"" Everyone knows how to write, technically, so in this profession you really need to sell yourself as offering something they want and struggle with. 

3) Network, network, network. I found a local small business support group and found plenty of clients there, because I am a small business and because I work with small businesses. Use the people you know. I tag along to some of my husband's business functions and any friends who want company. Anytime you're having small talk and there comes the question ""what do you do?,"" you have a chance to get your name out there. Pass out your business cards a lot. Get reaaaally nice business cards so you're memorable (I love moo.com, terrible name I know but very modern and high quality). Plus if you're good, reliable, and really easy to work with, you'll get referrals. 

4) FOLLOW UP. If someone mentions they could possibly potentially use your services, get *their* info and email or call *them.* Do not wait for them to contact you. Does it feel awkward and even rude? Yep. Do it anyway. Be polite obviously but track down all your leads. 

5) Don't give up. It can take a long time to build up a client base.

6) Get really lucky and catch a big break. I know, that's not something you can plan, but the previous steps prepare you for it, and this is how I really broke through to a bigger volume. Ultimately, you want clients that keep giving you projects, not just one-offs.  

One more note. I'm an introvert and used to be fairly awkward and really timid. It's not easy putting yourself out there but it's simply the only way. Fake it till you make it. Pretend you are confident. Pretend you are amazing. Pretend you feel comfortable. Be scared, and do it anyway. Be uncomfortable, and be social anyway. You get used to it, then you get good at it, then you enjoy the rush of feeling powerful. 

I'll discuss daily routine if anyone's interested but this is already long. Satisfaction level: A-"
"Note: my advice is directed at guys.

In my opinion, the two biggest reasons so many men have trouble meeting romantic partners boils down to two things: 

1) **Objectification of women due to lack of experience with female friends.**
When I say friends I mean *real genuine friendships* and not ""I'm only friends with this girl in the hopes she fucks me"" or the ""I can only befriend ugly girls because I'm not attracted to them."" When guys have little to no experience with having lady friends this tends to form the perception that women are bizarre, mysterious creatures... and this leads to objectification of women. Objectification isn't merely just cat calls and talking about women as if they're only pieces of meat... Objectification also includes *putting girls on pedestals* and viewing them as beautiful goddesses who can do no wrong.

In short, a lot of men simply do not view women as actually *people*... they're prizes to be won. You see this shit everywhere: movies, TV, and books always has women act as a reward for the hero saving the world, killing the bad guy, or just surviving the wacky hijinks that leads him to becoming the new Cool Kid of the school. And with this, comes...

2) **Relying on the media for dating advice.**
When a guy has little experience with women (either through dating or friendships) then what forms his worldview of dating an relationships? You guessed it, the Media. Reddit loves to joke about how unrealistic the Media is when it comes to portraying the dating world: the weird girl who's supposed to be ugly but is actually portrayed by a gorgeous actress, the ""dorky loser guy"" who's built like a male model, how stalking a girl is cute when the guy is a handsome billionaire, etc. While this is fun to ridicule and roll our eyes at, we forget that books, movies, and TV have actually been screwing with our dating/relationship expectations for our entire lives... this is why many curvy girls believe themselves to be fat, and many average guys feel completely inadequate when they don't have six pack abs. 

**My advice to guys still looking for a romantic partner:**

Firstly, focus on friendships. Whether it's a girl you met at work or a one you met on tinder, focus on just *being her friend*. If there is a genuine romantic connection between you too, it'll start developing. If not, that is OK... you still have a friend. 

Secondly, forget about all the usual crap Hollywood likes to portray, because human sexual attraction is nebulous and often times makes little sense: You think all girls like six-pack abs? I dated an gym rat who refused to date super ripped/athletic guys because she felt self conscious next to them. Think every girl only wants sexy tatted-up bad boys? I also dated a woman with full tattoo sleeves... despite being a totally clean-cut guy with no tats of my own. Think all girls want cocky/funny alpha males? My fiancee hates those type of guys and sees right through their bullshit.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and there really IS someone out there for everyone... you just might have to look a hell of a lot harder than others.

"Security guard at a community college. This guy was the definition of a rent-a-cop. Big, fat, awkward, no gun, and a whistle he was  not the least bit shy about using. A girl I was hanging out with needed to go up there to turn in a form and I went with her. We got there and the parking lot was deserted. That's when we realized it was a holiday weekend but since we had already driven up there, we went to see if the offices were open. 

Sure enough, the door to the administration building is unlocked so we go in. After walking around for a bit, we realized that all the offices are closed so we decide to cut our losses and head out. 

Suddenly, from the other end of the hall we hear ""FREEZE!!! STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW!!!"" It's the tub of shit security guard who comes down and starts screaming at us like a drill Sargent, demanding answers for why we're in the building, accusing us of breaking in, and not letting us get a word in. Finally I just cut him off and said ""Dude, we're enrolled students and the fucking door was unlocked. If you honestly think we're here to rob the place, call the real cops but we were already on our way out."" He then yelled a couple of things about this being our only warning, etc. as we walked away from him and left."

"I had a similar thing - I was waiting for a bus, and watched a guy crossing the street who thought he must have had time to safely cross, get ploughed into by a driver who had actually sped up. Watching him go up and over the car, while the car skidded to a stop, was in slow motion but the sound of the car hitting him was the worst part... It has haunted me ever since. I ran over to see if I could help, pulled the man to safety, and called an ambulance. I held his hand and stayed with him, keeping him awake until medical attention arrived and visited him in hospital the next day. Thankfully he made it out okay with minor injuries, but that was one of the most horrible, terrifying experiences of my life! "

"Storytime. Gym class, 2nd grade, muthafuckin Whiffle Ball. We got a youngin' on 2nd and 3rd, and I'd been practicing my homerun swing for weeks so I was ready to fuck some shit up, and fuck some shit up I did! 

There was a goddamn line that nobody is supposed to cross when waiting to bat, only about 2 feet out of the danger zone. So the soon to be cheerleader pretty-girl decides to goof off and try making fun of my stance while I'm at bat, and stands a bit close. Well, my full body power swing smacked the shit out of that Whiffle Ball, and the follow through smacked the shit outta that girl. 

Her eye was swollen shut before the paramedics even got there, nearly lost her vision in that eye from the swelling,  everyone was pissed that I fucked up the whole day of gym... 

But we won that fucking game 4-3 so fuck all you bitches, I made a sacrifice for that W

My coworkers didn't believe me till I found this half second shot of me opening the door for my boss.

"My brother used to eat random things, and then ask us if it would kill him. He did this until he was like 9 years old, this is how the conversations would go,

""Uhm, Nah, he'll probably be okay."" 


""Oh thank god, it was me, Revleck, I ate 4 blue crayons."" 


One time my mom was on the phone, and he was super concerned, and wouldn't take ""I'm on the phone right now!"" As an answer, and kept pestering her, so whenever he was bugging her and asking her the exact same question, ""Mom, I think Revleck may have eaten some of the playdoh you got for me, is he gonna die?"" Like 1 bagillion times, because HE ate the Play-Doh, my mom turned and said ""YES.""  



We found him in the bathroom sink brushing his teeth and crying, when asked he said through tears and toothpaste ""I knew it was gonna happen eventually, just not from Play-Doh! I didn't even eat a lot of it!"" "

Well basically, the divorce was cut and dry but as a professional that's not my business why, but I'm worried about his financials though. My guy was the breadwinner in the house. He was a construction foreman I believe so he was the guy planning, paying and watching his employees, he was great. Apparently his wife wanted fucking everything, but the thing that pissed him off the most was the fact that she took the boat, (his boat that he had purchased *before* ever meeting her!). The funny thing is though, she can not afford anything to move the boat with (I.e, truck). So he had to legitimately move his boat, with his truck, to some place she was staying at, and just leave it. He lost his boat. He asked me at the end how old I was, I tell him 21. He told me never to get married, I'll get to keep my stuff at the end. "

She would talk about how she couldn't buy groceries or keep her utilities on but she wanted to have another baby. and she was cheating on her husband. I hated her so much it gave me anxiety. She fucked up my business too because of her mistakes and our clients hated her. I eventually told my boss it was her or me. Boss didn't like confrontation so I said okay and took a job elsewhere. The girl ended up getting fired but it was too late. I wasn't going to stick around after that. 

Oh and several times she took her antipsychotic meds during the day (I think they were meant to be taken at night) and ptfo. She slept through the phone ringing and me yelling her name because I needed help. Ugh. I get mad just thinking about it.

"A little while back I used to live in this small apartment complex (26 units) that had a good view of the parking lot. Because it was a small complex, I knew most people there. I made friends with a neighbor who also happened to sell a bit of weed. He had a female friend that would stop by often. She was absolutely beautiful, petite frame beautiful ass, gorgeous face and a killer personality that would make your insides melt instantly. I quickly learned what kind of car she drove. Every time I'd see her car parked outside, I would hit up my buddy to see if he wanted to chill. I got to know her a bit from ""randomly"" running into her at my friends place. After a few months of this it came out that she had recently broken up with her long time boyfriend. I myself had gotten out of a serious relationship about a year prior so I was able to relate and even comfort her a bit. One day I was with some friends at a local brewery and happened to run into her. It was the first time we were able to talk outside of the immediate presence of friends and we hit it off real well. First date came a few days after that. And that was about 5 1/2 years ago. We've been dating ever since and are getting married in a few months. 

TLDR: I stalked a friend of a friend making it seem like random encounters until we actually had a random encounter. Now we're engaged and getting married soon. 

Edit: because people keep asking me if she knows, yes she does. I told her eventually  and she just laughs about it now. In her own words, she started visiting her friend more often hoping I'd be there. Especially after her break up, she'd get very excited whenever I'd show up. As /u/party_shark_  put it, we were both kind of stalking each other. Which is good bc it makes me feel like less of a creep. "

"Got home from work one afternoon and my wife was doing something in the kitchen wearing a halter top and a pair of cut off shorts--so--I walked up behind her, put my arms around her, undid her shorts, and pulled her top down. She was into it, turns around, gets down on her knees, starts giving me a blowjob, stands back up, pulls her shorts down, I sit her up the counter, we start screwing

A few minutes later, she says she wants to go doggy, gets off the counter, turns around, leans on the counter, I start going at it again, grab her hair, pull it back causing her to lift her head and she suddenly says, ""FUCK....Stop!""

I ask her what the problem is and I look up to see the 2 guys from the pool cleaning company, standing on our patio, looking through our sliding glass door, smiling, with one giving me the thumbs up.

We have not had sex in the kitchen in the day time since......"

"Was only allowed 45 minutes of computer time daily.

If anything happened to the computer, it was *the video games* fault, not the shady links my mom still clicks on 14 years later.

Edit:  I'm getting a lot of cool responses, but I can understand where my parents were coming from.

I'm originally from Poland, which as a lot of people know was a communist country for a while.  Everything was heavily regulated for quite some time.  Even after '91, the ""practices"" were still common up until ~2003 (at least in the area I'm from), so I got a chance to experience ""mild"" communism, though I was a bit young to grasp politics.

Coming to the U.S, they felt they had to regulate everything in the household, just because that's how it was since they were born.  Since then, they've really cut back and for the most part, they're pretty relaxed about everything, thought I feel like I got the short end of the stick.

Growing up, I wasn't allowed to hang out outside of school(even during high school) and in High School I wasn't allowed to date so my social experience was pretty pathetic to say the least.  After graduating, my parents saw ""no real threat from letting people hang out or date"" so my brother got a smooth ride through high school.

It's better now, although I still have issues meeting new people.  I've kept a small circle of 2-3 friends that I talk to, but hopefully that changes next year if I move into NYC for school.

"Home Depot.


My elderly grandmother was recovering from serious knee surgery, so my grandpa went hunting for a ramp to reach their back door. After several trips to Big box hardware stores, he came up empty and felt defeated. As he was leaving Home Depot, they stopped him and said they had a program that does community service projects for people that need it, and they wanted to build him a solution. FOR FREE. My Air Force retired grandpa broke down in tears in the store.

Not long after that they have a beautifully crafted and stained two-turn ramp complete with safety rails and anti-slip tape. They essentially made their home wheelchair accessible for them and any future owner with needs who may benefit from the set up. Incredible.

"Was having some sexy time with my wife last weekend. We'd gotten a little horny after going up to bed and as i'd been reading before action commenced, I had book open on my pillow, cover side up. 

It was a mock-autobiography of Alan Partridge, with the aforementioned character pictured on the front in a reclining pose. 

With every thrust, I could see Partridge looking up at me; almost willing me on. I was desperately trying to hold it together but I could almost hear him giving a running commentary in my head. I swiped the book from my pillow in a vain attempt to stop the imminent giggles but alas, too late. 

My wife had by now cottoned on to what was going on and was having her own battle against hysterics, but was getting close to climaxing so was trying to keep it together. 

It was then that awful thought came in to my head; what would Partridge say when at spunky junction? The image popped in to my head of him uttering his catchphrase (Aha!) in the throes of ecstasy and well, that was it. In between hoots of laughter, I explained this to my ever patient other half. 

We collapsed into peals of laughter, the moment irrevocably ruined but still laughing like twats.

"The company I work for is pretty hard to get into , even if you have an impressive resume or an awesome reference.  Unfortunately we had a new client. In 1 quarter his business would keep our lights on for about 10 years. 
He asked if his cousin or ""little nephew"" could have an entry level position at our company and we reluctantly said yes. 

The kid surfed the web all day looking at cars to buy. Whenever we'd ask him if he completed a task he'd either lie to us and say he did or say he didn't know how to do it and didn't want to bother any of us for help. Then he brought in all of his gaming systems into the conference room saying that clients could play them while they waited.

Two years later the client comes to us and says that he's going to have his nephew handle the work he was giving us for him / helping him start his own consulting firm.  Apparently the kid lied like no other making his uncle believe that he was helping run our company. 

3 months later he came back to us for our business.  Nephew tried hiring a consulting firm to the side to do his work so he could play Sonic the Hedgehog all day. "

"Thats heavy stuff. I can only guess it was because i was so young. Maybe 7 or 8. I think its because i wasnt old enough to fully comprehend the weight of the brutality in front of me, but i could comprehend my dad emotions, so thats what stuck with me. It still gets to me once in awhile, but its the thought of what happened to the victims more than the actual memory itself. Visual scars are hard to erase since the are burned into your brain, i guess im lucky i struggle to remember a  comepltly perfect image of the accident.

"I do the same while driving in traffic. If I'm in the right hand lane and notice someone driving up the breakdown lane, I will moive over the line just enough for them to be unable to pass. You have to wait just like the rest of us. You aren't special.

Edit: Let's address some confusion. I'm not talking about people merging and I'm not talking about people turning. 

I'm talking people who are already in traffic, pull over into the breakdown lane, and then proceed to drive down the breakdown lane to merge again further down, skipping chunks of traffic. And yes, if I am reasonably close to an exit ramp, I usually assume they are getting off and let them go.

Double Edit: and to add to my point. I witnessed an accident where there was heavy traffic and two lanes stopped to allow a woman to cross with her car into an adjacent parking lot from the opposite side of the road (lawfully using a turning lane). Enter: jackass who can't wait from traffic to move and decided to drive down the breakdown lane, crashes into this poor lady who thought all lanes of traffic had stopped to let her safely turn into her destination."

"I really don't know if I should tell it but I have to get it off my chest.

My mother and my aunt kidnapped me when I was 11. It was the last day of school before holidays and I was sick with a fever,my father and my sister weren't home. Suddenly my aunt (who lives a six hours drive away and never visited) came to a suprise visit and we had a nice breakfast. Mom was kinda in a hurry. My aunt let Something slip about a new flat,I didn't suspect anything until then. Then I see the things my mom packed up.
Aunt tries to play it cool and tells me we visit my grandparents.
I panic and run into the bathroom to hide,but my mother stops me from locking the door,drags me out. My aunt puts me in her car,locks the door and drives.

I didn't talk. For hours I was in a shock. She brings me to the town she and my grandparents live in,puts me in the flat,mom is coming shortly after. 
I am so stunned I don't know what is happening. Everyone tells me I will have a better life now. I just want to see my pets,my sister and be at my home.

I didn't hear anything from my father and sister in months. My mother doesn't let me leave the house unsupervised. I get to walk to my grandparents with her, nothing more.

I ran away one day when I was supposed to be in school and took a six hour train ride home,having no money at all,running the last bus ride from the station to the small town we used to live in. Beg my father to let me stay. He says I can't. I spent a night at home with them and then return to my mom who keeps all doors locked for the next year. I saw my father and sister twice. My cat ran away and died.

Worst months in my younger days were yet to come though.

I know it's not a typical kidnapping,it was my family after all. But looking back I consider it that, despite the fact it was my mother. A petty act of selfishness and definitely not something an adult and a parent should do.

To clarify:my parents got divorced months after this incident. Not before she took me with her.

Another thing a lot of people asked me: In the months I was on lockup my parents got through a divorce(I didn't know that at that time cause veryone was banned to talk about my father and basically anything that could cast a bad light on my mother). My mother somehow convinced the court I was better off with staying with her,though no one asked me on that matter,and so my parents settled with a 50/50 custody,she had the right to keep me with her.
When I got home to my dad and sister she had figured out I went there(six hours is a long time) and threatened to call police to retrieve me. Also unknown to me, she had stripped my dad off all his money including the house.It was sold a few weeks later. That is why he said I couldn't stay."

"I was in the campground at TomorrowWorld 2014, and some guy had grabbed some electronics from someone else's campsite (which is unfortunately not uncommon at music festivals), but someone noticed him as he was leaving and shouted after him.  

The guy took off and bolted as I turned around.  I saw him from about 40 feet away.  He was running sort of perpendicular to me, not directly away but not towards either.  I took a good angle on him and ran him down, tackled him, and held him down for ~30 seconds until security got to us.

Only frightening part was right as I leapt to make contact and bring him down, the thought crossed my mind that I had no idea if this dude had a knife or anything on him.  But he gave up as soon as we hit the ground, didn't even try to resist.

Extra points because I was with my girlfriend on one of our first dates.  This is the same girl who's gonna be my wife in about 3 months."

What was his riddle
"Stood up to my father.

Bit of background, my biological father is a bad guy. Like, worst of the worse. Raped twp 14 year olds, beat every woman he's ever had in his life, and is suspected of shaking my infant half sister until she was blind, epileptic, and horrifically mentally challenged. Poured honey on my stepmother and left her tied to a fence for the fire ants. Demented. He was also a huge guy, standing at about 6 foot 4, and built from his time on farms and in prison.

For reference, I'm five foot four. Barely.

I had gone no contact with him when I was 15, after I realized how fucked up what he'd done was. I didn't inform him, because it didn't seem safe.

It lasted about a year. We live in a small town, so we were bound to see each other eventually.

Long story short, my friend and I were at a store (Fred's), in the very back, just acting like teenagers. He walks over, acts happy to see me. I explain, as politely and simply as I can, that I don't want to talk to him. 

He asks why, I tell him because of what he did to those teenage girls. He gets mad, red in the face, talking about how long ago it was. (He was in his mid 30s when it happened.) I say it doesn't matter.

I still don't remember what he said during his tirade. What I remember was a grown man, a huge man, with his red face right in mine, screaming at me. I remember thinking about how he'd hurt people very badly before, and knowing that he could easily hit me and get away with it,  because he was my father.

First instinct was to gtfo, not gonna lie. But I didn't. Instead I stood firm, stood straight, looked him in the eye, and continued to repeat  calmly why I wasn't in contact with him whenever he gave me a chance.

Eventually, he either ran out of steam or realized that I wasn't backing down, and left.

I'm 23 now. I haven't spoken to him since. He was put back in prison for a few years, for beating another wife of his. He's out now. Anytime we see each other in town, he looks away and won't make eye contact.

"I just came here to say this. It made me realize how little I pay attention to the way others see me. Not in a superficial way, i.e. the clothes I wear and the way I present myself, but who I really am and the way the things I say and do affect and are perceived by other people. I realized I come off as a totally different person than I think I do. Everyone thinks they're the good guy and they can do no wrong in their own mind. This film made me realize that even though I really think I am kind and caring deep down, I come off as an asshole to a lot of people.

"We went to a party with our colleagues at a bar and she (drunkenly) sat down in my lap and said the following (in order):

I want to have your babies. 

The button on my shirt is loose can you fix it? I have a sewing kit. 

She's a pretty demure girl so this was her best effort at 3 different come-on techniques at the same time, hilariously. I put her in a car home while she argued with me that she was 'sotally tober' and just wanted to have my babies. Monday at work she apologized and told me our colleague told her what she did and was sorry if she embarrassed me. I told her I was flattered and that maybe we should talk about kids after dating for a little while and that I'd be happy to sew her button back on if she would have dinner with me. Apparently she'd been crushing on me for a long time but only got up the courage to say something while totally wasted. 

We dated for 3 years, everything was kosher at work, and only split up because we had to be in different places for our careers. We're still great friends and I send her a button every year on her birthday with the card and bust her balls as frequently as possible about how she's so bad at flirting. She and my (now) girlfriend are pretty close, and her boyfriend and I are bros- he's going to propose next month and I'm super happy for them. "
"Man, I was such a dumbass.... soooo many warning signs.

I respect a woman's right to choose, so now I have a lovely 12 year old daughter. I still didn't leave. When my daughter was born, she started doing the same thing again, drinking screaming, etc. I broke up with her and we started sharing our daughter 1/2 and 1/2. A bit later I transferred to university and stupidly decided to give it one more shot. After living at uni with her and our daughter, I found out all of her trips back home were to have an affair. I was like what the fuck, I am in college, work two jobs, take care of the baby... you know. So I noped out. I have had full time custody of my daughter for ten years, and her craziness gave me the best gift I have ever received."

Here's the abstract:
The present invention provides an apparatus and method of producing transformed water without contact between the original transformed water and the water to be transformed. This is accomplished by organizing the original transformed water into a geometric contained arrangement such that a central cavity is created that substantially surrounds the water that is to be transformed. The water to be transformed is placed into a confined vessel such as a cylindrical container or a pipe inside the central cavity for about sixty seconds. This water then becomes transformed in the same likeness of the molecular clustering of the original transformed water."

* Buy a book on estate planning. It's never too early to start, and you really should start planning for kids and their future before even considering having them. Do it right and they won't be burdened by loans their whole life.

* Don't live beyond your means. Money dwindles fast or accrues fast, depending on how you set your budget. 

* Actually try at work. Most brag about redditing, or how much they can get away with on the job. Literally trying at all sets you apart from most and will get you ahead in your career.  

* Change jobs often. There's no job loyalty. Trust no one, and protect yourself. Also have savings for several months unemployed if necessary. 

* Don't marry too young. Not just for being mature enough, making sure the SO is right, but because accruing some money prior to starting a family goes a long way.

* A big trip travelling around the world every other year is more rewarding than small trips often. Grow yourself. Experience the world. Learn as much as you can.

I work for a forgotten department, as in, in the grand scheme of things we are about as useful a baby with a planner. 

So this small department has about 6 people and 2 managers. 1 of the managers works in a different building overseeing the manager and the 6 staff. 

I am busy doing my work while (lets call her Neems) is chatting up the inhouse manager. Idk how this woman gets work done because she shares my office aswell and is always on her phone or talking to the manager about men and shit like that. 

So I guess something happens in the life of the in house manager and she just ups and leaves without saying anything other than ""neems I gatta go fast, ill call you"" thats it nothing else. 

Not even 5 minutes go by and I get a notification on my email that we have an urgent meeting in the conference room.... host? you know who. 

subject: ""!!! urgent, #deadlines, #priorityhigh,!!!""

I literally lean over to look past my monitors and say ? dude whats up with this meeting and all those hash tags?

She bolts out the room .... i see her speed walking past my glass walls into the conference room... I follow slowly with my coffee. 

In the room she has already set up the projector to go over the ""tasks she wants us to do, since (manager) is away and left her in charge...""

I say ""ohh when did she say you were in charge"" she ignores me obviously. 

I look at the only other guy in the room and he already knows whats up and is laughing. 

we proceed to have a 30 minute meeting about things we were already doing, how she feels we need to prioritize and how at the end of the week she will be the one to do our 1 on 1's/


Needless to say I walked out, and walked right back into my office and went on reddit. They could see my monitors from the conference room.

"I was in Oahu Hawaii hiking the Nuʻuanu Pali area with my boyfriend one afternoon. It was our first time there and our first time in Hawaii. We had chosen to hike that area because it was beautiful and heard that people see chameleons there sometimes. It was a beautiful hike. It was a very green rain forest with tall trees and bamboo. We decided to get towards the edge of the mountain towards the cliff and that's when me and my boyfriend decided to split since we had the feeling we were getting close. I was alone hiking for probably about 30 minutes when I thought I heard somebody running through the forest in my area. I looked around and then the running sound was followed by silence. I didn't think anything of it so I decided to sit down and take my gopro camera out and mess with the settings. I was sitting in silence again when I heard leaves brushing through the forest as if somebody was running through it again. Then it sounded like there was more than one person running and all I could think was ""who chooses to run in a muddy steep forest right next to the edge of a cliff?"" and then the running stopped again and there was no one there again. I was alone but I started to feel like there were many people staring right at me. It was starting to get uncomfortable and I got up and left the area to look for my boyfriend. I couldn't stop thinking about the sounds I heard of people running and why there was no one there. I googled the area and found out that many people had experienced the same thing I did. The sounds of people running through the forest. People believe they are the sounds of soldiers running through the forest before they fell off the cliff to their death in a battle that took place there in the late 1700's. I thought I was going crazy but googling that place gave me chills. "

She always wears a white dress and walks from house to house to ""spread the word of the lord"", on bare feet.
Before I knew about her, me and my cousin were at his home watching horror movies since it was late and dark and rainy outside. 
You can guess what happened:
All of a sudden she stood outside the window with her wet, white dress pushing her face against the window, yelling ""JESUS LOVES YOU ALL""

Teacher asks why. Student replies, ""My mom took a shit in my backpack"". The teacher kinda just stood there for a moment, and then called the kid's home. The father answered. I only heard one side of the conversation.

Teacher: ""Your son came into a class without his backpack, and claims his mother... pooped in it. Uh-huh... Ok.""

After he hung up he just went back to teaching.

EDIT: So many people want more info, so this is what I remember about this kid. His mom was a severe alcoholic, and abused prescription medication. His father was a lawyer.

"I was pregnant with our son at about 14 weeks, and started to bleed. The doctor on call told me I was having a miscarriage and to let it get on with it -- there was nothing that could be done. I accepted that with grief, but we had two small girls, and I went on for a day, spotting blood. Then randomly, I stood up and blood gushed down my legs, and filled my shoes. I called my husband home in a panic and he rushed me to the hospital. My placenta had partially torn loose from the uterine wall, and all the blood that should have gone to the body was pouring out. There is no surgical way to fix this and most of the time the babies and even the mothers die. I was told that the only chance was for me to lay still and hope it healed back. I laid on a mattress in my living room for 4 months until everything seemed safe. The baby came out fat and healthy and just graduated college these many years later. But I was one of a small percentage that survived.
Tl-dr: placental abruption nearly killed me and my son.

"I picked up a young couple, both very drunk. Despite warnings, they proceeded to have sex in the back of the car. I turned around to tell them to cut it out, and we got in a head-on collision. My car ended up flipped around on the freeway, thank God no one was hurt. 

Thing is, we all were jostled around a great deal during this whole episode. The young lovers weren't wearing their seat belts for obvious reasons. The woman was flung over the front seat. And wouldn't you know it, once the car came to a stop she ended up draped across the passenger seat, upside down.

"I was the last of 7  kids to older parents, who had to survive during the depression.  Ten cents meant not losing the farm to taxes, or having food for 10 days.  They assisted, or made us kids, earn a $1,000 before we left high school.  After high school, you left home.  I put away $960, and my father wouldn't give me the last $40, and made fun of me that I couldn't reach the 'family' goal.  I got to go 'away' to college with a partial scholarship due to academics, had one bag of possessions, and I wrote a check for my tuition, which was just about that exact amount. I've got to say, the pride of paying my own way meant nothing.  I never got to finger or spend a single dime on anything I earned, and it affected me for a long, long time.  I gave my money to someone else.  I was so deprived of money as a kid, my Mother was hesitant about giving me 5 cents for ice cream.  The last time I asked was in the 3rd grade; when I was in the eight grade she asked about me not asking for money for ice cream 'in awhile'.  Both my parents were just tramatized by the Great Depression.  They never overcame their fear of not having money, or having any freedom to spend it. As far as I know, we children provided for everything my parents needed after we got jobs, so they kept all the money they earned.  When my last parent passed away, the estate included $250,000 in cash, and full ownership of a 100 acre farm.  After getting about a 7th share, I upgraded to a better house, less debt, but it felt like nothing.  There's no reason to deprive your children, or yourself.  Nourishment to the body is more than just fluids or food.  I have survived and then some; the some just came way later than it needed to; it lingers in mind as I move into retirement.  I can recall the single moment my young daughter felt like she needed more money to be with her friends; I never felt more ashamed, and that never happened again."

"The Breakfast Club. I watch it every few years, since I was 18. When I turned 30 I watched it again, and for the first time, I identified with the adults. 

I got why the assistant principal was so full of rage...he was middle aged and was stuck in a job he hated dealing with kids who already had more power than him or would someday...his life isn't gonna get much better than this, and he still wears the leisure suits he used to prowl the bars in back when he still got laid, probably because he believes it makes him feel or look younger, but the kids just laugh at him. He hates his life, he hates the choices he's made, he hates himself.

I got the janitor's confidence. He's not ambitious but he works hard. He's patient. He's okay with where he is in life (and maybe makes more than the assistant principal even) and he knows one day he'll have a nice retirement and do the things he's always wanted to. He realizes the power that lies in being invisible and uses it to function as his own form of justice. He sees who has a good heart and is a quiet hero for them; he sees who is rotten and finds ways to punish them. He doesn't need to dream big because his needs are covered and he's appreciating the here and now.

I understood the parents...bitter, trying to force their kids to live the dreams they never finished, angry about where they are in life while having to raise optimistic little people who look like them and have better futures ahead. 

I got the adults. And a couple of times I caught myself rolling my eyes at the kids. It broke my heart and I cried for a long time when it ended. I haven't watched it again since."

So many artists proofs, HCs, etc. Sometimes artists and dealers will have a falling out and the artist will declare a legit work fake just to screw over the dealer. Different dealers will hire their own art experts to declare known forgeries as authentic. The same experts will declare rival collections as fakes. It's all dirty and quite a few art dealers careers will involve a stint or two in jail for fraud. "

Ex-Brother in law got a girlfriend pregnant. Had a falling out half way into her pregnancy. So as a result, she moved across the country, fought him from the state she lived in giving him no chance to mount any decent custody arguments without spending thousands in fees to travel. As a result she ends up with full custody and getting the maximum amount for child support. He has paid said support monthly via direct deposit from day one and has never missed a single payment. 


For the first 5 years of his daughters life, his baby's momma would file yearly with the state she lived in that he hadn't paid (up to a maximum claim of 3 months no payment) and was in hardship because of. The state she was in would cut her a check, bill it to our state, who'd garnish his wages under threat of jailing him. Each time she did that it took him 6 months to rectify and get his garnished wages reimbursed. But there was no provision for our state to get money back from hers, so she never so much as got a slap on the wrist for doing this. 

Finally record keeping in her state caught up to the point that his bank could easily verify to said state that she had indeed been paid which finally put a stop to her ""hardship claims"". 

Edited to add context: IDK why she was able to get away with it, afaik, our state never considered themselves being defrauded because she never filed anything here. The child is now 12 so all this was prior to 2010. AFAIK they will go back for a custodial hearing in the next year for her to have a ""choice"" in who she lives with.

"https://www.budgetbytes.com/ is a great resource. But it depends on how 'poor' you're talking about. Something like [Dragon Noodles](https://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/08/spicy-noodles/) though is like $2 of ingredients, and very easy to add something like broccoli and/or chicken into it.

Edits:

Just wanted to clarify a few things for folks asking. 

**Ingredients**

The odd cost per ingredient is based off already having that item in a typical bag/jar/container/whatever. No, they're not suggesting you go out somewhere and ask for tablespoon-sized servings of cooking oil or a single egg. This is generally done based off the 'common' ingredients that most kitchens should have. IE: sugars, spices, cooking oils, noodles, rice, etc etc.

**Portions**

If you think the Dragon Noodles recipe is still too expensive, toss in some more noodles. I usually get a bag of noodles for about $1.50 - 2.00 or so and toss at least half of it in there. Not sure what size that is, but like rice and pasta noodles, you get a lot more than you think after they soak up the water. It feeds two people well with leftovers to spare. You could toss a whole bag in, add another egg and some more sauce, ziploc container that stuff up, and have lunch ready for the whole work week.

Just be wary that this lady doesn't understand how rice works. She'll have a 'dinner for two' recipe with **4 CUPS OF RICE**, which is an absurd amount of rice. Usually a single cup is more than enough for two folks for a dinner. 2 cups leaves leftovers. 4 cups? Yeah, I don't think so. Just wasting rice unless you want to do something with it afterwards.

**Substitute for Cilantro?**

Heathens! Basil could *maybe* work? Apparently there's something called thai basil, so that might be your best option. I almost always forget this ingredient though, but the recipe works just as well without it. You also don't even need the green onions if you're a simple fellow/gal. Oftentimes, I usually just do this recipe with broccoli, crushed peanuts, the sauce mixture, and the noodles. Just depends on what I have in the fridge or not.

**It's still too expensive!!!**

Well it won't get much cheaper than the recipe above, but things like [black beans](https://www.budgetbytes.com/?s=black+bean), [chickpeas](https://www.budgetbytes.com/?s=chickpea), and [pork](https://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/meat/pork/) should be your new best friends. Don't be afraid to look in several places for ingredients! Hole in the wall Hispanic food stores are often **great** places to get spices. Your local store probably sells an average sized spice shaker of cumin for like $2.50 - 4.00, but your average Hispanic market can sell something like three times the size for $1.50 or 2.00. They'll have things like pepper, salt, and other common ingredients as well -- not just 'Mexican food' stuff.

The chain pharmacy near me also has a small grocery aisle with dirt cheap spices and cooking essentials as well. Things like olive oil? Get as big a damn bottle as you can find. Trader Joe's has really nice sized bottles for like $7-8. They're also Californian olives, so none of that bullshit about trying to pretend to be Italian olive oil (some whole crazy thing about that). Trust me, it's worth the cost, because you'll always need olive oil, and these things will last you a good while.

Meats: just depends store to store. The Harris Teeter (grocery store) near me rips you off in regards to pre-packaged chicken, but you can go to the deli counter and buy chicken breasts for $2/lb, which is a great deal. One of the other stores near me sells steaks dirt cheap, so I eat a lot of steak actually. Makes me feel rich, but I'm literally only buying the cheapest meats available (almost always whatever is on sale). Pork is usually the cheapest of the 'main meats', but I feel like the prices have gone up. Making spaghetti? Use ground turkey, you probably won't even notice the difference.

Also, **MAKE SURE YOU GET THE GROCERY STORE/PHARMACY 'REWARDS' CARD** or whatever they call them. I see so many people going through checkouts without using them. I'm a cheap bastard and will do whatever it takes to save money (aside from coupons, which is a totally legitimate thing everyone should use), and if all they want is a name, address, and phone number? Hell, give it over! I've saved hundreds of dollars this year by going in and bogo'ing on things like toilet paper, etc etc.

According to u/perfunctorium:

&gt; at any retail store in the US, you can enter in (your area code) plus 867-5309, and there WILL be a store card available for your use. (The retail pharmacy for which I work has about a dozen people listed under that number. Pick one, it all works the same.)

They'll give you tips on any alterations to make the recipe better or whatever.

"My fiance and I are still together to this very day - however, when we were teenagers, he snuck me into his room and had to go out to a concert with his dad. I just spent the time watching TV, played a bit of Diablo 3. Now, his mom wasn't supposed to know I was there. I slowly needed the bathroom as time went on but I kept hearing her downstairs, just humming or going to the bathroom and just existing. But as time went on, I desperately needed to go poo. It got to the point where my poor butt was hurting and throbbing. I was slowly getting panicked and saw a lone empty Tim Hortons cup on his desk. I squatted in the middle of his room and filled the cup right up. I put the lid back on when I was done and put it in his garbage. I threw a bunch of extra tissues in the garbage and cleaned up his room a little to cover up the cup. Sprayed febreeze in his garbage and used sanitizer in my purse to clean my hands. Heart beat fast when he came home later on that night, complimented how I cleaned his room and made it look nice. I just smiled nice, hoping to god nothing happened to the garbage bag that the Tim Hortons poo cup was in."

"I did not personally witness this, but my wife did.  I don't know that it's technically ""brave"", but it is a shining example of clear headedness and lack of panic.

A few months ago, my wife had just loaded the five ""little"" kids up at grandma's house and was driving them home in our Pathfinder.  Just as they were getting on to the interstate entrance ramp, my eighteen month old daughter started choking - she had a ""Dum Dum"" type lollipop from grandma (a candy she had eaten many times without incident), and it had come off the stick and lodged in her throat.

My wife - a trained, seasoned ICU nurse who has run many a ""code blue"" situation - panicked, as there was traffic behind her and no shoulder to pull off the road for a good half mile.  

My nine year old in the back seat of the car realized what was going on.  He calmly unbuckled himself, leaned over the seat, made a fist, and drove it into my daughter's solar plexus.  Pop!  Out came the offending lollipop, and while tears obviously followed, all was well.  The boy may have quite literally saved her life.

The crazy thing is, I don't even know where he learned how to do that.  He knew about the traditional Heimlich maneuver, but all I can figure is that he (an avid fan of all sorts of youtube videos, plus some Discovery stuff) came across it at some point and retained the information.  He was utterly nonchalant about it, too, like saving lives was no big thing for him."

"She thought anything she did while she was upset didn't count. For the most part that took the form of screaming at me over stupid things. It got to a point where I ignored the screaming. 

Anyway, she injured her shoulder skiing one day. Two doctors, one of whom was my dad, and one physio told her that there wasn't anything wrong with it. I'm not a doctor so I assumed three opinions meant it was fine. 

A year later her shoulder still hurt so she went to another physio who determined she had a torn rotator cuff. She underwent treatment but after a few sessions she still had pain. After one of these sessions she was supposed to pick me up in my car because her car was in for service that day. Traffic on the way was worse than she expected which upset her. And her shoulder pain was also my fault because I didn't tell her to get a fourth opinion right away. So you see now that I deserved to die. "
"In the US that most of us are only one serious illness away from catastrophic financial destruction. 

It's insane how easy it is to end up in a situation where we simply can't pay for the care we need. I've seen it time and time again. Many suffer more because they won't get regular (can't) healthcare to prevent many catastrophic health issues. It's really sad.

"I read a comment once upon a time that talked about the difference between how European countries tend to view freedom and how the US does. Basically the claim was that European countries tend to view being free as living in a situation where they were best able to pursue the things they wanted. They were more free of hardship. Americans on the other hand tend to view freedom as being free to make their own choices, and receive the consequences of those choices both good and bad.
I am not sure if this is really true, and it's obviously super general, but if it is accurate I think it explains this particular difference pretty neatly. Americans think it is better to allow individuals to make choices about their health, even if those individuals are not entirely qualified. European counties tend to think it is better if the choice was made by a qualified professional."

"Growing up my family never had sharp knives. In fact I don't recall that we had knives with proper blades at all, I think they were all serrated crap. So naturally when doing the washing up it was fine to throw all the knives in with everything else, because I wouldn't cut myself even if I grabbed a handful of knife.

Well when I was 15 I got my first job working in a hotel kitchen. First time someone put a knife down next to my sink for me to wash I immediately grabbed it and tossed it into the sink like I would do at home. A minute later I was standing next to the chef with paper towers wrapped around the massive cut in my thumb asking where the first aid kit was. He immediately started shouting at everyone demanding to know which idiot put a knife in the sink, and I had to explain that I did it to myself and could I please have a plaster."

"I used to live out in the country and you couldn't really see my house from the road, so you had to know where it was if you were gonna stop by.   My SO at the time was stationed overseas, and I was up late studying for a test. About 11:30, my dog, a sweet and large pit bull, started barking and wouldn't quit. Since I lived out in the boonies, I just assumed it was a deer or something. I took him outside to let him chase off whatever it was. We walked to the edge of the house and he wouldn't leave my side, he just stayed there growling at the darkness.   I was a little freaked out but whatever, I took him back inside and he started barking again. I tried to just keep studying, but about 15 minutes later, I heard what sounded like old country music coming from my back porch, then a man's voice. This scared the shit out of me, I immediately called my friend (instead of 911) because I was still convinced I was making shit up in my head. I then turned off all of the lights in the house and took my dog to the bedroom and hid while I waited for her to come get me.   The next morning we came back and there were huge boot prints all the way around the house, he was standing around the corner from where I was when I took my dog outside. I called the sheriff's office and they came out. They told me that if my dog hadn't sounded like he'd bite someone's face off, whoever was there probably would have forced his way in the house.   I moved into a friend's house and found a new place to live, but in the mean time, I would go back to get things I needed. Each time I went back, something was different, a window screen was taken off the window, the deadbolt cover was broken, but as far as I know, he never went in the house and he never fucked with my SO's car or anything else outside.

"I dated my high school boyfriend through the first year of college. He didn't work at all in high school, but I did, so I drove him around and paid for most of our meals and outings with friends. It sucked, but it was high school, so I didn't think too much of it. After we graduated, I told him I wanted to save as much money as possible for college while I worked over the summer, and I wouldn't be able to pay for everything anymore. He angrily asked what I expected him to do for food and fun. I said ""Get a job?"" He exploded. Called me names, cursed me out, all of it. I should have ended it right then and there. But I was 18. And dumb. 

One full year later, I was buying him clothes, paying for almost all his meals, and taking him to and from his community college classes every single day, while also working and attending the state university (on the other side of town) full time. I remember waking up one day and realizing I wasn't his girlfriend, I was his mother. I dumped him that day. I didn't even cry. I was so relieved.

"Like most racists, I assume, I had no idea I was being racist. This is how I found out. (Forgive me for repeating myself, because I spoke about this before in a different context.)

I'm a geneticist, and originally worked on fruit flies, like many do. Later in my career, I switched fields to work on an organism that causes a disease that exists mostly in the developing world. Suddenly, my colleagues went from being 99.99% white to being at least 50% black and Latino -- because they were Africans and South Americans (though many of them had positions at American and European universities). When I started meeting them and hearing about their work, I found myself feeling a bit surprised that their research was as rigorous and innovative as that of the white dudes in my fly world. I had not expected them to be so dedicated to good science and building good research plans. 

I had never questioned why the colleagues I had worked with were always white. I think, in some way, I had the idea that people of color just didn't have ""it."" I can't really even say what this ""it"" was, but probably some sort of mixture of natural talent, good work ethic, and dedication to something abstract like science. I hate to think of treating my black and Latino students differently during this time without even noticing it -- at the very least just not making that much of an investment in them because I assumed they just wouldn't make the cut. Not to mention possibly having a different reaction from the beginning, seeing an email or resume from a LaQuita Jackson or a Carlos Mendez-Herrera as opposed to a Madison Wilson or a Jeremy Adams.

If, while a fly biologist, someone brought the idea up to me that I was judging people based on their race I would have said they were insane. I am very liberal in my politics and consider myself to be highly aware of the social issues of race, not to mention being a hyper-rational (or so I thought) scientist, as mentioned above. In fact, I bet I would have said that if a black student ever showed any real interest, they would get all sorts of special treatment and be promoted beyond their abilities. I would never have thought that maybe the reason those students didn't stay on in the field was because they didn't feel welcome and could sense that people didn't believe in them or had patronizingly low expectations. Maybe they never even got in the door in the first place because of this issue. Implicit bias is a bitch.

"We had a snow day in college and my friend convinced me to play D&amp;D. I was sort of half into it. The DM gave me a pre-rolled fighter for the easy mode. 

So the DM sends us all a quick IM telling us to meet in the dorm common room with drinks and snacks, in one hour. He tells the other guys, ""I rolled a fighter for Ganglebot because he's new. Come with a new character for yourselves - NO BARDS they're annoying"" 

One hour later, one of the guys shows up in a renfair costume with a guitar, and proudly presents his bard half-ling. He literally freestyles bard songs about everything that was happening. THE DM WAS FUCKING LIVID.

The DM immediately says, ""This is a one-off campaign. If you die that's it, you're out.""

In the first encounter the DM brings up a goblin with a single-shot staff that deals 10,000 damage. The bard rolls high initiative and goes first. He knows this ad-hock goblin is here for him. He says he's holding his turn. Someone else swings at the goblin and misses. Its the goblin's turn. The Goblin goes to fire at the bard. The bard uses a spell to switch places with someone - my fighter. It kills me.

I wasn't invested in the game anyway so I laugh, say thanks, and leave. The bard sings me out. Half way down the hall back to my room I hear the DM start yelling."

"They still do in the district I worked. We had 6 when I worked but down to 2 now. They depend much more on recon flights nowadays.

So being at such a high elevation, you get radio signals from miles and miles away. I was in Oregon and could listen to radio stations out if Texas and Mexico although they were really quiet and cut out. I would hear the weirdest CB radio chatter as well. Lonely truckers, HAM nuts and just random stuff. One time I got a call from someone looking for ""the kid in the lookout tower"". It wasn't a strong signal, so they weren't super close but they asked alot of questions about the terrain and if they could drive up to the tower. I told them sure, come on up. Another lookout asked who I was talking to because they only hear my end of the convo. I told them I was probably getting visitors.

A few hours later this beat up truck came up the road and stopped under the tower. This really dirty guy got out, looked up at me in the tower, studied it for a bit, waved and yelled up ""can you come down? I didn't know there were so many stairs."" I yelled back that I was on duty and couldn't leave the lookout. He kinda shrugged and looked around for a bit said good bye and drove back down the hill.

A week later as I drove into town for a day off, I passed that same truck about 3 miles down from the tower facing up hill, like he was on his way back up. I didn't see the guy anywhere and assumed he was camped off in the trees. When I came back up in two days it was still there.

A fire crew the next week came upon the truck and called it in as abandoned as it was partially blocking the road. The wrecker came and got it. That dude just full on disappeared. No one really looked for him either. Pretty sure I was the last person to see him alive. 

I speculate he parked and went into the woods and had a heart attack or stroke. He wasn't keen on climbing 10 flights of stairs and didn't look to be in the best of shape. I assumed I spent the entire rest if the summer within a short hike of a decomposing human body, but maybe he did abandon his truck and got a ride with a friend. The creepy part is I never found out."

"So I've just been dating this girl for a month or so, and we're hooking up at her place. You know how it is with a new relationship, you're always worried about doing something embarrassing. 

Now we usually just put her iTunes music on shuffle when we're fooling around, but her phone wasn't handy so we're using mine. Which was a gamble because a good 50% of my music is ridiculous shit I downloaded on a whim, but I was horny and in a hurry so I figured I'd roll the dice. 

It went fine for a while! Pretty good mix of good sex music, I'm behind her, we're in the middle of things, and then Ray Parker Junior starts belting out the Ghostbusters theme. She freezes, doesn't turn around. I freeze too, already trying to think of a way to play this off without spoiling the mood. Then she snickers, says ""bustin' makes me feeeel good,"" and starts grinding back in to me while laughing her ass off. 

Obviously I married her. Going on three years now. Ghostbusters is still in our sex playlist. "
"I think being fair and honest with each other and taking care of which areas of the relationship you are better suited/equipped to do. The whole idea of a relationship to me is that you're better off combined than as individuals.

For example: in our relationship I work in IT and she's a teacher. I make four times what she does so we split all bills etc. by that ratio. She contributes in a meaningful but manageable way. I pay for most of the ""extra"" expenses (e.g. holidays) and I bought her a laptop, but she doesn't feel like a kid as she's still involved in the majority of ""living expenses"" expenditure (and it's not my home, it's ours).

Alternatively, she's at least 374 times smarter than I am and far better educated (bilingual with a top-tier Uni education). She makes the decisions around things like housing (her dad's an architect so she knows what's what) plus things like education for our future kids, as that's obviously an area she knows far more about than me. 

The guilt of me knowing she works longer hours and is smarter but makes way less than me is a bit hard to stomach sometimes. I was lucky to fall into an industry which is in demand and has good rewards. We were both pretty poor when we met, so that helps.

Overall though, we have a shared long-term plan - the details of how we get there are less important. My success is her success, and vice versa."
"To add to the stupidity, the cave was only a few feet high, so we had to crawl in on our stomachs.  We decided that we should crawl in head to toe so that if something went wrong we could pull each other out by our ankles, because safety first right?  I was in front with the camera and a flashlight.  The second I turned on the camera and realized I was only a few feet from 3 bears, I nearly shat my pants and broke my cousins nose trying to crawl backwards."

"Not really a relationship, but a first date.

I was 19 and a junior in college at the time. One of my TAs asked me out.  I believe he was 3 years older than I.  He picked me up at my apartment and I let him in while I finished getting ready.

He started telling me how he could teach me so much about the world and life in general and how I had so much to learn, blah, blah, blah.  Basically, he was saying I was his inferior but he'd be happy to teach me until I was more at his level.

It was really a WTF moment.  Why someone would think the way to a girl's heart was to disparage her intelligence and tell her how superior you were?

I showed him to the door and locked it behind him.  I was seriously waiting for him to fuck with my final grade, but he didn't, which is good because I would have rained some shit down on his stupid head.

"A ton of conditions such as respiratory cancer, prostate cancer, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease.

It is a defoliant sprayed on Vietnam countryside in liberal amount to kill the forest and smoke out the North Vietnamese soldiers. It has the ability to deform genes, and as such millions of Vietnamese people are living and being born today with serious physical and mental health conditions, although the war has passed a few decades ago. The children of these veterans or those living in affected areas frequently have genetic diseases, mental illnesses, missing externalities, etc.

I cannot claim to be 100% on top of the political situation, but in my knowledge the US has just started funding a project to help Vietnam detoxify an area heavily bombarded with Agent Orange in 2012, and not much else especially for the people suffering (claiming that their conditions might not be caused by the chemical, hah).

The US Vets had a class action lawsuit against the manufacturers and some stuff, and while I'm all for better treatment of US veterans, I wish that the Vietnamese counterparts had ... something to support them as well.

Edit: Thank you to those who have come to share with me their personal stories about the war. It's not over for many people."

"There is a not insignificant amount of Agent Orange buried somewhere in my hometown. During Vietnam the chemical plant in my town produced Agent Orange for the military. When it was discovered that the stuff was basically instant cancer-juice, production was halted and all the barrels that hadn't been shipped yet were just dumped in a big, concrete-lined hole and sealed up.

As far as I know, nobody knows where it is (although I'm sure it's documented somewhere at city-hall to make sure nobody digs a well there or something). The town now has all these crazy groundwater contamination measures, like these things every so many yards in the water/sewer system that, if they detect so many ppm of a chemical they don't like, will shoot this fast-hardening foam into the pipes and seal them off."

I didn't have the best micro, as to be expected on a dial-up connection and a potato computer, so I tended to stick to 3v3 RT where I could win with macro strategy, and boy did I git gud. I played so many games, that when a teammate would fail to load, and therefore my other teammate would quit rather than play a 2v3, I would control all 3 bases myself and still win about 50% of the time. I made a smurf account and went 55-5 doing nothing but a Demon Hunter + 6 archers + straight tier 3 tech Chimaeras.

I was out for a long run, probably around 12 miles on dirt roads through Iowa farmland- plenty of abandoned barns and old buildings alongside it.

It's an old man, fairly well-groomed- if I could compare him to anyone- he looked a little bit like Jerry Sandusky, but grayer, and with more black in the corners of his mouth and eyes. He was wearing a white sweatsuit and carrying a black plastic bag over one shoulder- it looked heavy and full.
The man smiled at me, and I smiled back- even though physically I was distancing myself as far away from him as possible.

As I passed him by, I began to feel dizzy and nauseous. His presence just felt *so* wrong. His smile was *off.* 
I actually had to swallow back vomit that had begun to climb up my throat... my adrenaline had gone up, and my pulse was hammering.

"I'm a pilot. I fly smaller aircraft than most commercial airliners (So think Cessna's, Learjets, 6 to 30 seaters type of aircraft).

One similarity I have noticed between the smaller aircraft I fly and large commercial aircraft is passengers behaviour when the plane hits the gate is exactly the same. The minute the engines spool down, they are up and ready to get off.

I've come to form the opinion that this phenomenon is actually a conditioned response by people. Indeed my co-pilot and I where discussing this once during a flight and we decided it is probably something more than just having been sat down for a number of hours or to get off the plane.

I have sometimes considered the theory that it's some form of deep survival response in humans. When we get on a commercial aircraft, we are essentially putting our lives in the hands of two people and a collective of parts and components engineered to work together in an environment man was never genetically designed to be. My theory is that after you land, you subconsciously have a relief mechanism that says ""Thank god that worked out"" (Even if your not scared of flying) that manifests itself as a desire to get out of your seat, get your stuff and get off, even when there are people ahead of you.

I also believe its the same reason people start lining up before their boarding class is even called, even though the seating is pre-allocated. It's the same subconscious desire to get it over and done with. The quicker your on, the quicker it's over.

Edit: Thought I would add this, as so many of you are mentioning it. There's probably something to the ""I want to get my carry on in the overhead lockers before they get full"" argument for people queuing to board the aircraft before they are called. There is debate in the industry at the moment about becoming super strict on hand baggage size and/or forcing you to check anything bigger than a laptop bag because the cramming of the overhead lockers is leading to longer boarding times and starting to become an issue for carriers with push back of the aircraft."

Craziest thing I ever saw though, there were these two guys, a white, kind of racist kid and a black kid.  They were roommates.  

They were also best of friends.  Drinking buddies, partners in crime, tweedle dee tweedle dumb.  Every time they got in trouble, it was out together.  

I say ""kind of racist"" because the kid was flat out racist in his attitudes.  He would say racist things.  He never treated me or any of the guys in the unit with disrespect.  As I said, his best friend was a black guy, 

BUT

he would see a white woman with a black guy and go off on a tirade.  He openly said and thought super racist things.

So here is the crazy part.  He would say this wildly offensive, racist shit right in front of his roommate.  I'm like, ""dude your best friend, who IS black, is standing right there.""

That's when I realized, he hadn't let go of his racist attitudes, but having gotten close to his friend, he'd forgotten to see him as ""a black person"".  You would have to literally remind him that he was black, because it didn't register with him anymore."

That's more to begin with than people in many countries around the world could dream to achieve in their lifetimes. If you are dissatisfied you must use your voice.

Vote where you find candidates you can support. If you can't find any, encourage like-minded people or run yourself. Attend protests and rallies. Write letters and emails, and get as many people to sign them as you can. Contribute to discourse; *learn* from those who disagree with you and compromise on minor issues so that you can unite on major ones.

Educate yourself on the mechanics of government: the first past the post system, the influence of lobbyists and alternatives to these. Demand accountability from your representatives.

"As a kid, I made my mom take me to one of these auditions being advertised on a radio and then to some acting classes, which were about $1500. I brought headshots and a whole notebook to try to learn. Literally the only things they taught were to avoid using “um” and try not to pause while speaking. At the end, there was another audition, which I passed (I’m assuming it was just a filter for household income), where they tried peddling a $6,000 trip to L.A. for another audition except with real agents. And that is when I learned about financial responsibility. "

As a father with custody, the above are two of the most crucial things that can be done. Many hate to hear it, but men have an uphill climb in these antiquated/bias family court systems from the start. You have to work harder to get a fair shot.

Concerning the kids being distant, they will come around. Kids are smarter than we give them credit for. The spoiling with toys, sabotage attempts from the ex, all leading to the horrible feeling that you are being erased from your child's lives...that will all be relatively short-lived. I. Fucking. Promise.

**Edit**: I will add a little anecdote as I want fathers in particular to be aware of this:

I had achieved primary physical custody. It went fairly smoothly  for many years. All visitation with the mother we basically handled out of court, as I had no interest in dealing with it anymore. My child lived with me. With holidays, it's customary to rotate. Well, one Christmas my kid's mom went nuts about the visitation agreement we had set. Some words were said, nothing threatening or too incredibly insulting. As soon as Jan 2nd came, she went and filed a Protection From Abuse order against me (including our child in the document). Now, remember, this is a woman who was deemed unfit to raise children by a court.

Once the next visitation rolled around I suppose the paperwork was still in the mail. I had no idea at the time. Well, she kept the kid. And she did it legally for 2 months. I was not permitted anywhere near the kid until a judge heard the case and decided she basically created the scenario in her head, then abused the system to score a momentary win against me. But, for a time, that ""loophole"" gave an unfit mother her child back--just like that.

Beware of things like this. They only need to make the claim. No evidence is required. This tactic is fairly common and a lot of women are aware of it. Even if something like this happens to you, remain calm, continue with your notes. You are in this for the long haul.

Real, living Christmas trees on every street, it was magical and I miss it dearly.

"I sometimes imagine how horrific it would be, if it were possible, to fall into one of those huge liquid nitrogen cryostats outside of labs and hospitals. Because the density of LN2 is so low, you would instantly sink straight to the bottom, but because the viscosity is only a fifth of that of water, you would flail hopelessly there, unable to move yourself at all, let alone propel yourself back up to the top. After 5 seconds the pain of frostbite over your entire body would be unfathomably excruciating. After perhaps 10-20 seconds your skin would begin cracking and falling off as your still warm muscles used the last of their energy in pointless struggling. After perhaps half a minute, your limbs would be immobilized from freezing, but mercifully I suspect you would black out from asphyxia by then. If you fell in liquid oxygen on the other hand...I'm not sure how long you would remain conscious before vital organs and the brain began to freeze.  Additionally, if you were unfortunate enough to encounter a heat source somehow at your feet, you would self-immolate utterly, from bottom up, to nothing but carbon dioxide, water, and a little ash.

I went downstairs and I noticed a door I missed earlier. I opened it and the dim ambient light spilled down the first two steps into the cellar. Everything else wasnt black exactly but more like the complete absence of everything.

"I went on a guided ""caving"" tour in NE Alabama a few years back in the Tumbling Rock cave system. There were 14 maybe 16 of us with one guide at the front who knew the cave, one in the middle and one in the rear. The other two guides were supposed to be relatively experienced but didn't know the cave we were in. The first 3 hours were really cool. We went through the main shaft and saw some neat formations and one side hole that was opened up in a small overhang. It was pouring out water. This led a short way to a HUGE vertical tube. Couldn't see the top of it and it was literally ""raining"" evenly throughout the tube. We went back out the hole and completed our journey at the ""Christmas Tree"" which was a two storey stalagmite (rising from the ground up). On our way back to the entrance, one of the guides was all like ""hey there's a really cool side-cave to explore that's a bit more of a challenge"". Everybody was kinda hesitant but agreed to explore it. 

Turns out this side cave was only accessable by a tiny hole down in a cave-in area. We all had to squeeze through this vertical descending hole. Now, I'm 5'9"" with a slim build but If even one of us got stuck here or at any other of the multiple crawl, hang, jump, or shimmy holes, we all would have died. This was some expert level shit and EVERYONE was barely keeping the panic in. There were areas we had to army crawl through mud and rocks with an inch of clearance. Yeah. 1 person has a panic attack and we're all screwed. There were areas you had to hang off of and if you missed your blind drop, you'd end up in a casm of unknown depth. This ""little side cave"" took about 4 hours to complete. We all made it but I'm pretty sure everyone in the party was regretting it. 

When we finally exited the cave after about 7 hours inside the earth, the property owner came up to our group and was like ""you guys were gone for a long time, what happened?"" The guide leader told him we went into the side cave and the property owner got visibly upset and told the guide that area was off limits and that they knew better. He informed us that because of the small access area and the difficulty of that cave, that if there were any injuries, we all would have died and there is 0% chance of rescue. He was pissed. 

Lesson learned: fuck caves that aren't relatively mapped, safe, and guided by ACTUAL professionals. These guide leaders could have gotten us all killed. I will never go caving again.  "

Not even sex, but I legitimately crave to cuddle with someone, but even a simple hug would do; the thing is though, since I've moved away from my parents I haven't been touched by another person in months besides a handshake. The problem is I feel like the only way to get these things is to be in a romantic relationship, but I'm making a lot of big changes in my life and don't have time for one, and if I'm afraid to ask my guy friends and any female friends might think I'm trying to 'make a move'.

"&gt; What do mummy and daddy issues look like?

These ""mummy and daddy issues"" aren't necessarily a bad thing. The idea is that we all carry a internal mental model of our parents and we carry our mental parents with us throughout our lives. They form a part of how we cognitively process information in the world around us. We're sort of mentally asking ourselves, ""what would my mum think of that?"" even well after they are long gone.

&gt; And what are some of the ways we're predictable?

Behaviour responses. Most of us have had some common experiences (e.g. having been bullied in school, having been dumped or heartbroken). These experiences often shape future behavioural responses. So once you understand someone's behaviour responses to certain life events, you can begin to make predictions about how they will respond to future or current life events."

"I recall reading a defector and activist's AMA, and they said something along the lines of a lot of people in the South, towards the border, are more generally aware of what's happening. But they said towards the northern part of the country, people are a lot more isolated and left in the dark, and they believe a lot of the propaganda because there's no exposure to anything else. They said the propaganda is pretty powerful overall though. Smuggling films can only get you so far. 

Edit- Since this has received a bit of attention and a lot of people are questioning the logistics of smuggling through the DMZ, I decided to find the original AMA. The OP actually said ""border towns vs heart of the country"" as opposed to a ""North vs South"" basis, so my original wording was a bit off. The OP also doesn't reveal how or where they smuggle films.

There are some factories that share employees, the South has giant speakers set up across the DMZ that blare anti North propaganda, NK troops can see SK and US troops at the DMZ, etc. So just to clarify to everyone questioning the ability to smuggle films across the DMZ, information sources in NK from the outside world come from way more than just smuggled films, and help feed information to NK citizens near the border, thus leading them to be more informed about what's happening in and outside of their country.

Once me and all my friends once went to a music festival. Anyway one of my brothers mates who is a complete prick, couldn't be there on the first day of the festival, but asked my brother to set up a tent for him.

That night everyone was wasted and decided to go to sleep in the early hours. I snuck out of my tent and literally crawled commando style to the dickheads tent. I undid the zip and crawled in....

The next day when said dickhead arrived, he opened his tent to find someone had done a massive shit in his tent.

To this day people still speculate who it was. I am known for being funny about using public toilets, so nobody ever suspected it was me! I acted outraged that someone would do such a thing!

Not even ashamed. He is such a prick!"

Over decade ago, ""big sexy hair"" was a decent dry hairspray, and only sold by select salons. Couldn't get online or just any super market like today.

"Extreme markup for quick, shitty quality.

Worked here for six years but not anymore so fuck it.

Getting a large job done at Kinkos (FedEx Office)?  Don't need it for a few days to a week?  Don't be a shithead and say, ""I need this done now/ASAP"".  If you do that, it gets produced ""in-house"" and you'll pay up the ASS.  Instead, ask for a bid.

If your bid is over $250, say no.  They WILL drop your price by 10%.  It's called ""10 to win"" as in they drop your bid by 10% to win your business.

If your bid is over $750, say HELL NO.  Tell them you wish to speak directly with their National Bid Center.  You will get a call within 24 hours and your price will be dropped DRAMATICALLY.  I've literally seen a $5k order get dropped to $750.

They then send your order off either to their CPC (Central Production Center), OR they literally call another local company and they do it.  Either way, the quality of work will be a million times better than if they ran it on their shitty Canon machines that break down constantly.

One last thing:  NEVER print from their computers.  If you need something small done quickly, AT LEAST have your file(s) on a USB stick or in your email as attachments so that you may use their (hit &amp; miss) cloud service.  You're looking at minimum $0.99/page for color plus computer time charged per minute v. around $0.50/page for color and no computer charges.

Better yet, befriend an employee and find out what company they send shit out to locally.  Look up their web page, call them for a quote, and be amazed as your price literally drops 50% (100% markup when they outsource). 

Edit: Forgot to add that the employee you want to befriend will need to be at minimum an LPC, or lead project coordinator, and even then they might have no clue where it gets sent to.  You want the one you see behind the printing counter that seems to ignore you until someone else helps you.  

Edit again:  Took me a moment to remember, but since you're my friend and live in L.A., you can skip befriending an LPC and go straight to [Complete Printing](http://www.completeprinting.net)."

"I picked up an elderly lady in my 3-series bmw in a rather sketchy part of Memphis at about 8am on a weekday morning. No big deal right? She gets in and says ""alright I need you to take me to work, but first we gotta go to the liquor store"". I say ok and start toward the nearest liquor store, thinking she is just picking something up for after work. On the way there she mentions she works for a repossession company and that they work for a car dealership that intentionally sells cars to people that can't pay for them. She says she wants to swing by an address on the way to work to see if there is a car she needs to repossess located there. She says the cars usually have gps, but she thinks the cars owner has disabled the gps. 

We arrive at the liquor store and the lady goes in and comes out. She gets in the car and before I can ask her not to drink in the car she has downed an entire pint of vodka. At this point I can't even be mad; I'm flabbergasted. Laughing, I ask the old lady if she even had a chaser. She pulls out a Capri Sun, stabs it with the straw, and starts drinking it. She says ""you probably think I'm some sort of alcoholic or something"" I reply ""I don't know if you are or not, but at least your up and at em this morning headed to work"".

 Then she starts directing me back into the sketchy neighborhood to search for a black Chrysler 300. I make it clear to her that I am only a driver and that if we find this car I am not getting out of my car. She agrees and says she'll just call a tow truck if we see the car. As were cruising this really sketchy area looking for the car, she is getting more and more drunk as the alcohol seeps into her. She keeps asking if every black 4 door car is a Chrysler 300. I'm wondering if she even knows what a 300 is. I notice we are getting strange looks from the people we drive by as we head down a long dead end street with a shady looking, gated apartment complex at the end that kinda looks like the street from the movie Training Day. We reach the end and go to turn around and I realize again how sketchy we look cruising around here. If the cops saw us they would assume we were looking for drugs or sex or something illegal. I notice again that everyone sitting outside the apartment complex is staring at us like we are an elephant in the room. 

I guess she senses my discomfort, or maybe she had to be at work at 9am, because she says ""ok now I feel like I'm ready to deal with these motherfuckers, let's head to (such and such sketchy car dealership)"". 
So we get close to the dealership and she says park over there and produces another pint of vodka and Capri Sun from her bag. She downs *half the pint, mentions something about saving some for later, punches a straw in her Capri Sun, says ""time to go to work, have a nice day"" and exits the vehicle. I'm just sitting there like wtf.

This was a seriously hardcore old lady of probably 65 or 70 years. Or maybe she just looked old bc she drank so much, idk. Was a pretty nice fare tho, with all the driving around we did for an hour.

* I forgot the part about saving some for later. I edited the text above to include that part. So sorry to disappoint everyone, old lady only drank 24oz of vodka in my car, not the full 32oz.

Im just...so tired of feeling like this...and feeling like I am not loved....and I just dont know anymore.

""Babe. Literally 1 day isnt going to kill you.""

Whatever.

So then I give in and we hang out again, and shes grumpy with me 90% of the time because I only hanged out with her because I felt guilty or because she wanted to and it wasnt just my own decision to hang out. So then I have to convince her it was my idea, to which she then feels bad and gets upset because reasons and the only way to fix it is hanging out more.

"While we're on the subject of bird-related shenanigans...

A little over a year ago I was homeless in the Bay Area. I'd spent the previous night in an illegal encampment/meth den; the next morning, as I got off the BART and walked into town I only just barely noticed I was about to step on something small and colorful. I looked down to see it was some kind of exotic bird. A cockatiel or small parrot, I wasn't sure. It was hobbling along the sidewalk outside of a new apartment complex; it must have been hurt because it wasn't flying away from me and only just barely walking. I figured it must have been someone's escaped pet. I looked around and there was no one else on the street and the closest apartment buildings had no open windows I could see.  

Deciding I couldn't just leave it in case it was run over or a cat got it, I picked 'her' up and walked into the reception of the nearest apartment. I asked if anyone had reported a missing pet and they said no, and that tenants weren't allowed to have pets anyway. 

I stuck around outside the apartment for an hour or so, in case anyone came looking for her; I saw no one. After awhile I decided the best thing to do would be to get help from a veterinarian. I couldn't keep her myself, obviously, because I was homeless. I couldn't get to any rescue centers because I don't drive and from what I saw online, the closest ones were impossible for me to reach on foot. I figured a vet would be able to take her, on the off chance that someone had enquired about their missing bird, or at least one of the staff would be willing to drop her off at a shelter for me.  

I set off on a long walk towards the closest vet; I must have looked a right sight - a mildly bedraggled, possibly homeless man, wandering around with an exotic bird in his hand. I saw a lot of rubber-necking and people at traffic lights actually rolling down their windows to ask about her. 

On the journey, the bird and I actually made friends; I'd been holding her cupped in my hands in case she tried to fly off, and she'd been nipping and biting my fingers. I sat down to unpack some food for us and we shared a stale sandwich and some water. Tentatively, I opened my hand, expecting her to go crazy or try to fly off, but amazingly she just maneuvered herself to [perch on my finger](http://imgur.com/55rlBz6) and seemed content there with me. 

So we set off again: one hobo and his bird. When we made it to the vet's a few hours later they explained they couldn't help, and were unwilling to take her as it went against their policies. They suggested I try the others vets in town to see if they could do anything more. The next couple I went to said the exact same thing. 

Flummoxed, I started to worry a little; what the hell was I going to do? It was early in the year so nights got very cold. I was barely making it sleeping fully dressed under a winter blanket. AFAIK, birds don't handle the cold very well, and I couldn't put her under the covers with me for fear of squashing her in my sleep. I couldn't put her in a box or anything in case she wandered off and/or got attacked by a cat. I messaged some friends to see if they could take her but they were all unwilling or able, and suggested I go to a vet. Birdy, in the meantime, didn't panic and [kept her cool](http://imgur.com/PoVVBx3).


As the day dragged on, I managed to visit the last of the vets on my list, and they all said the same thing as the others. It was now nightfall, so my options were non-existent. I decided I'd just have to pull an all-nighter at the local Safeway café, and I'd figure something out the next day. 

As I was sat in the empty dining area, feeding her some bird food, one of the staff was walking past and did a double-take. ""Is...is that a bird? In here?"" I thought she was going to ask me to leave, but she came over intrigued. I told her my story (avoiding the fact that I was homeless) and she had the strangest response - she explained that she was an exotic bird aficionado and offered to take the bird in! She whipped out her phone and showed me all the cages and birds she'd had over the years. She said her shift was finishing up in an hour and that if I could stick around till then, she would take birdy off me and put her in the pet carrier she had in her car. As I didn't have anything better to do and I wanted birdy to be safe, I stuck around. Sure enough, the lady comes by later and we go to her car. She has a small pet carrier in there and tells me tomorrow's her day off, so she'll take birdy to the vets for a checkup and some treatment. I said one last goodbye to my new [feathered friend](http://imgur.com/wDVKSoq), thanked the lady for her help, and trudged off to my dumpster.


Thus, the adventure came to an end. I was actually sad to part ways with the bird; maybe it was just the company. But I was happy she went to a caring home, with someone knowledgeable about birds. Whenever I went into the store after that, the lady was always happy to let me know how the bird was doing. As of six months after I found her, the bird was happy healthy, and able to fly again.


TL;DR, homeless man finds abandoned exotic bird, roams streets with it, gets a lot of weird looks, coincidentally bumps into random store worker that loves birds, a happy ending for all."

"Texas mesquite smoked brisket.  Slow cooked over the smoke for many hours so that there is a red ring inside the blackened crust.  Tender and flavorful, with a peppery (not sweet!) sauce on the side.

Alternate cooking methods include a thick dry rub of pepper and salt.

You know that you are in the right place when the line is long and you are groaning from the sweet smoke flavor that is coming from the on-site cookers.

Team that brisket up with some cheese and jalapeno bread, and perhaps a slice of pecan pie.  And a couple long-neck beers."
"Reviews in general are shit. They tend to be filled with either a bunch of fake good reviews or raving reviews from insane customers.

The staff is caring and friendly and the pool is totally lit! I loved every minute of living at *insert apartment name*"". Neither are true. The complex is average. A few of the reviews reflect that but most don't."

"I was thirteen and hiking, with a friend, along a creek bed in the woods near my house. The woods were to our left and went upwards in a dramatic incline; there was a trail that led from the top to the creek and we were just about to ascend and go home as it was dusk and it always got very dark very suddenly in the low laying patch of land.

We got about halfway up and we saw a shadow ""blocking"" the entrance. It was the figure of a person - a tall man. We both startled to a stop and laughed. The guy didn't move. Finally he spoke - ""Can you ladies help me find my dog? He ran into the woods.""

We look at each other and I'm thinking yeah, why not? We start walking toward him but we both suddenly start feeling weird about it. He doesn't have a leash with him or anything and he's still just standing there. I still can't see his features because the sun is behind him.

We both stop and I say something like, ""actually, we have to go home. Sorry.""

He doesn't move or say anything and I freak and turn around, bolting back into the woods; my friend follows. 

I look back and he's no longer blocking the way, the light illuminating where he had been. He's not there because, I realize, he's fucking chasing us.

I scream and run blindly forward into the woods, my friend behind me.

We ran for at least twenty minutes and eventually I can't hear his footsteps or his breathing, which had been heavy and grunty.

We stop and pick our way out of the woods via a yard and walk home In silence.

I'm pretty sure I was almost abducted that day. I think about it often."

That was already pretty weird, but then I learned that they also had a previous monkey before that. It had been playing in the laundry while the maid was loading clothes in the washer. Poor thing died. Makes me wonder why they didn't call the test-child thing off after the first one died. "

"Didn't actually happen to me, but I wanted to share a scary experience a friend of mine had. He was on a sheep farm in mid February staying in the old farmhouse which was situated in Tipperary in Ireland, being paid to keep an eye on the ewes while they lambed.
It's in the middle of nowhere and a long long way from the nearest occupied neighbouring farm. So as you do, he packed his shotgun and kept it close to his bed at night and allowed his trusty sheepdog Rocky sleep over his feet at the end of the bed.
One night, he said it was two weeks into his watch, it happened. 
Being mid February, it was cold as hell and nothing's colder than an old farmhouse with zero insulation, so he had two whiskeys before laying down for the night. Before he went to sleep he checked his gun and patted Rocky.
In the middle of the night, he said it was close to 3am he was woken by a strange animal cry, one which scared him bolt upright. Then there was an massive explosion and the window was burst out by a dark shadowy figure. He got such a fright he shat the bed there and then. Hugging the blankets to keep himself safe....
He later realised that the cry outside was a Stag calling for a mate. The explosion, was caused by him knocking the shotgun over and it going off. And the window exploding out was Rocky, who was scared shitless of guns to start with. When it went off the poor fucker jumped through the window."

Doesn't matter if it takes you 15 minutes or 4 hours, but you'd better have done it. It's much better preparation for the world of employment too, where a decent boss will care far more about results than effort.

Edit: Also, if your kid has clearly had enough of lessons, then for fuck's sake let them take a break for a year or so, or even without any intention of returning to it.

"Willingness to change and a good therapist  

Edit: ok my first response was admittedly over simplistic.
1) Willingness to change is key. Be prepared to face the things you don't want to face. When attempting change, expect unwelcomed resistance from within yourself and lean into it: there's so much to learn.
2) A good therapist: We're not all cut from the same cloth and one therapist may favour a certain therapeutic approach over another. They all have their merits. Find someone who's a good fit for you.
3) Inform yourself. Go beyond what you think you already know. Read books, ask questions, listen to what your body is telling you.
4) Don't set out to be the perfect human being (namely because it doesn't exist). Practice self awareness and always be open to growth. Life gets much easier after that.

When I was 16 I took the small 14 foot fishing boat out fishing before dark and lost track of time. Huge storm kicked up (we're talking 4 foot waves and hail) and threw the boat into some rocks and dumped me into a shallow cove on a relatively large peninsula connected by wilderness to the mainland.

It was dark and I had no way of contacting anyone (cell service is a bitch in the wild) so I decided to flip the boat, make a shelter, and hunker down for the night.

I woke up sometime during the night to the sound of howling. Loud howling. I turned my flashlight on and scanned the treeline and saw a wolf snarling at me maybe 20 feet away. I noped the fuck out of there, scrambled under the boat, and spent the night using my fishing pole to dissuade him from digging under the side.

"Thank you so much for that simple advice about rating mistakes. I recently left a 20 year marriage where all of my mistakes were punished through emotional attacks. I lived in fear, and worked all day to avoid making any mistakes. I didn't even realize that this was happening until a few months before I left. Once I saw, I couldn't unsee.

Now I am returning to the job market after a 19 year break. Pre-marriage I had total confidence. Now even the smallest error causes extreme anxiety. And I make a lot of mistakes, especially since I'm in the first few weeks of the job. The person training me is pretty intense, and there's no room for error. I do see her making mistakes, but there's not much grace towards me.

I must find a way to function so that I am not gripped by anxiety all day long. It's exhausting, hard to breathe, and makes me wonder if I can even hold down a job. What you propose about rating mistakes is completely brilliant. I will start tomorrow."

Edit 2: For everyone saying I'm a faker check the description of the first picture. I went above and beyond to prove it's me. 

Edit: because the news article doesn't have much/correct information.

I had just got home from a bartending shift and was walking my dog. My neighbors across the street, who were gangbangers liked to harass anyone latino looking that walked by. They were drinking and I happen to walk up when they had a couple surrounded with knives, bats and some other various weapons. I had my bartending flashlight on me and shone it on them hoping they would run thinking I was the cops. this ended up being what saved me because they all threw their weapons as they ran. They quickly realized I wasn't a cop and came back but the couple had a quick second to get away. I ended up fighting them for quite some time. The police report and my neighbors (girls who thankfully grabbed my sweet golden retriever) said that I lasted for over a minute and was holding my own. Then  a cab driver tried to help by running some of them over. That separated me from the group and allowed one of them to pick up a 2x4 and crack me in the back of the head. Luckily a police officer drove by about the time they were dragging my unconscious body up the street and kicking me. When I woke up there was so much blood I thought I was dead and this was the afterlife. I looked up and realized from the expression on the 40 or so onlookers that I was not haha. This was the busy downtown area and the bars had just closed so their were a bunch of people who came to look what was going on and about 10 cop cars and an ambulance. I ended up with a broken eye socket, broken nose, two broken hands from fighting for so long, 40-50 stitches/staples in face and head. The victim's restitution find payed all my bills and the stiffest sentence handed out was 1 year and the guy got out almost a month after because he never posted bail. They only ended up arresting 3 guys. One I had knocked out, one was bleeding and they followed the trail to an unlocked parked car, and my neighbor who lived in the house across the street. The scariest part was the 4 days they waited to arrest my neighbor. Every Time detectives would come over the gangsters would hang out on their porch and stare at us talking on my porch. Theirs a news video somewhere I'll try to find.

"Specifically men. More specifically men between 16 and 25. They tend to smack their heads into hidden rocks, but it also happens in swimming pools. They usually drown, usually immediately. 

I saw a video once of a young man who had broken his neck flailing up to the surface of a pool to swim incredibly poorly. His friends assumed he was doing a bit and laughed at him. They were imitating his noises...

After the most excruciatingly long minute, one of the young women off camera screamed. Her mind just broke, she knew something was horribly wrong and didn't have vocabulary for it so she just screamed, and the whole mood changed. All these bodies leapt into the water and thrashed toward him at once. He was rescued and is a quadriplegic if I remember it right. 

TL;DR: Young men reading this. Don't dive headfirst into a new swimming spot. Okay? You can do it the second time in. Nobody will notice. "

"You should definitely try it if you get the chance to come to Louisiana! If you want to try and make it yourself it's not super difficult. Just time consuming. You have to make the roux which takes about 30+ minutes of continuous stirring spending on how dark you want it. A good roux is the base of a good gumbo. Then you add in the trinity (chopped celery, onion, and green pepper). After you stir that into the roux and let it simmer you add you stock (preferably homemade either chicken or seafood) along with what ever meat your using whether it be crawfish and crab, duck and sausage, or chicken and sausage. Then you'll want to let that cook down for a pretty good while covered up after adding in all your spices (crystal hot sauce, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, paprika, etc.) and it's going to take more hot/spicy seasoning than you think. Make sure to cook it down (on a low heat) and really get the flavors in there. Your whole house will smell like the rich gumbo. As for how long that is I've never timed it. Just til it looks, smells, and tastes right. It'll thicken up to. Now when it's done cooking let it cool to room temp and put it up for the night. Let it sit over night so the flavored will completely set in and the next day for dinner or supper heat it back up and serve over white rice."

"Your best bet is to be as consistent as possible. I had this issue a lot - turns out I was being flaky all the time, which sends the signal that you're not actually interested in their friendship. Say yes to every invite that you get (if you can), don't flake, don't be late, and take initiative in making plans once in a while. 

That being said, you could do all this and still not find a connection, and that's okay too. Not everyone is looking for new close friends and not everyone is going to click with you. But ime simply showing you're  interested raises your chances of taking a friendship to the next level."

 Around 1am on a Saturday he gets a ping that's at 200% surge near the bars. He picked up a well dressed Man who's sober and once he's in the car he asked to be taken to the casino. He was picked up in Dallas and the casino is in Oklahoma. Feeling bad he warned the guy ""are you sure that's a 70 mile trip and your on 200% surge.  Guy says it's fine and he's happy my buddy is getting paid.

 They enjoy a nice trip and have some normal talk and once they get to the casino my buddy ended the ride and netting himself $300. They guy then realizes he doesn't have a ride home so he makes a deal with my friend. ""Look I'm gonna go gamble for a few hours of I give you $250 now will you wait and when. I come.back I'll give you another$250 for waiting and another $500for the trip back. Buddy agrees and takes a nap until guy I'd done. 

 Guy comes back and gives him the cash and they head back home..during the small talk the guy says "" Look you've been great and seem like a stand up guy. I want to throw another $500 your way if you let me suck your dick."". This dude wanted to pay my friend 500 just to suck his dick! When you ask him what happened next he just laughs and says ""Well rent was due and if the worst way to make $500 bucks is a pretending a chick is blowing you then it's not so bad""

One day I was sitting on a plane that had just taken off and thinking to myself that, for once, I was having a good airport/flight experience. That didn't last too long. About 10 minutes into the flight the captain got on the speaker and told us that they had forgotten to put fuel in the plane and that they were trying to fly back to the airport, but they didn't have clearance to land. They weren't sure how long we would be in the air bc for whatever reason air control wouldn't let them land. We circled the airport for about 40 mins. I honestly thought I was going to die that day. The funny thing is that as scary as that was, the reason I stopped flying in Nigeria in bc I once saw my pilot get onto the plane wearing flip flops. That's was did it for me. Flip flops dude?

So, he's paying child support because he's still claiming parental rights and fighting for visitation. Biological parent or not, that is a major reason this case is more complicated and ongoing."

"A friend of mine in high school worked at a pizza place. One of the delivery drivers was just ridiculously smart when I talked to him. Later I found out that he use to be a nuclear physicist. His wife was also a nuclear physicist, but left him for her lawyer.

He got screwed out of his kids, most of the assets, and had to pay a lot towards alimony/child support. He did the math, and figured out the tips he didn't get taxed on plus his minimum wage delivering pizza was more than keeping his job as a nuclear physicist. Plus he got a little satisfaction not having to pay her as much. The guy was really nice. I always felt bad for him. "

"not me but my dad 

My dad was stationed in Germany in the 80s in the US Army, and every 10 years or so they would do whats called a 'winter reforger' which was basically a giant game of war where two sides competed against each other, and y dad happened to be there during one. him and a buddy operated a tank, but due to some complication, they needed reinforcements, so they had to stay put and wait. they got bored and walked to a small nearby town to get a bottle of applecorn(a type of alcohol). As they walked into town they saw a young boy riding a bicycle, they stopped him and asked him the nearest place to get a bottle and he gave them directions; as they were following his directions they saw a bar with a bunch of people in it, but for some reason the kid didn't mention it, but they went in anyway. As soon as they walked in, everyone stopped doing whatever they were doing and stared at my dad and his buddy, literally everyone, including the waitresses. After about 5 seconds everyone simultaneously started acting normal again, like nothing ever happened. A little creeped out, they asked to buy a bottle of applecorn, however they refused to sell one to him, instead giving them both free shots of it, after this they kept insisting that they sit down to eat. They were passing around giant bowls of food and everyone would take some from the bowl and pass it to someone else. But my dad didn't want any food, they just wanted to buy a bottle of applecorn, but they kept refusing, only offering shots and food; finally they got tired of it and left. As they were walking around looking for somewhere else to get the applecorn they passed the young boy again and asked him about the bar and why they refused to sell them the applecorn. The boy turns pale and stammers ""you went to THAT place!?"" and immediately cycles away as fast as he possible can. my dad and his buddy look at each other like ""what the fuck?"" curious they walk back to the bar to check it again. But when they get there, the bar is completely empty and the lights are off, they stare inside through the glass and the chairs are all upside-down on the table with cobbwebbs everywhere, and the shelves behind the bar are completely empty and not longer stocked with alcohol. And they checked around the whole area to make sure it was the same area, and sure enough it was the same bar where only minutes before had been crowded with people. They then found another bar and bought some applecorn and quickly got the fuck outa there

To this day my dad and his buddy swear on it and say it's the creepiest thing they've ever witnessed"

"Not being able to do something because of a lack of money. I hate that my kids have missed out on so many things because we simply didn't have extra money to pay for it (sports, camps, school t-shirts, school photos, after school programs, school trips, pool passes, etc). It sucks. For us as parents and for them. I've seen their friends (and their friends parents), who have more money, just not understand at all as if we can just pull an extra $100 out of thin air. Sure, we could, but then there would be no food that week. 

The flipside is our kids are extremely grateful when we can do something extra, and I have seen some of their friends be ungrateful brats because they just expect to be able to do whatever, because money isn't an issue. But it still sucks.

Edit: Just to say thank you for all the support and kind words! Did not expect this at all, and I really needed it!! I'm a little (ok, a lot) choked up. Thank you, thank you, thank you!😄😘"

"I'm at a large grocery store doing a bit of shopping - one of those giant megastores that sells groceries and clothes and everything else.

One of the things I'm looking for is frozen hash browns, and there are literally three full aisles of freezers in this place, all stocked with any manner of frozen food you could think of. 

So I'm wandering up and down the aisles, looking for hash browns. Let's see, frozen pizza, frozen vegetables, frozen fruit, frozen bread.... nope nope. Keep going - here's the frozen breakfast food... hash browns are breakfast, right? Waffles, breakfast burritos... no hash browns.

Next aisle, frozen dinners, entrees, appetizers.... nope. Aha, that sign says potatoes! French fries, tots... no hash browns. What the hell.

Suddenly I realize that there's a guy approaching me. Older guy who obviously works there - has the shirt and name tag. Doesn't say a word to me - just walks right up and hands me a bag of frozen hash browns. Smiles and walks away. I just stood there like an idiot with my mouth open - I didn't know how to react to that.

Some people say that God is looking out for you when you avoid an accident or recover from a serious illness or find that perfect job right when desperation is setting in. Apparently it was a slow day for tragedies that day since that's when the miracle of the hash browns occurred."

"My mom was a real piece of work in this department. My mother is mentally unstable and was very abusive to me as a child. When my father finally moved out and asked for a Divorce I was luckily old enough (13) to legally decide who I wanted to live with. I, of course, chose my dad and that enraged my mother. By court order, she was allowed to live in our 4 bedroom house while me and my dad had to move in with my aunt into a two bedroom house. We lived there for 4 years while my mom did everything she could to slow down the divorce proceedings. During this period my father was court ordered to pay the mortgage and utilities on the house my mother was living in. She would leave all the lights on and crank the heat with the widows open just to drive the utility bills up. She once left the garden hose on for a week into a drain to even make the Water bill outrageous. When it was finally all over and she had taken my dad for as much as she could she decided to sue him for my college fund. I called her and told her if she went through with it I would never speak to her again, she told me if I wanted it I needed to move in with her before I turned 18 so she could get child support from my dad. I refused, she won the case for the money and my dad had to use most of what was left of the fund to pay for her lawyers costs. "

"Damn. It's nice to know there are nice people out there. I did sleep in the Kmart that was there in Muskegon a couple times. They never knew I was there, but I got to know some of the workers and one security guard there because I spent a lot of nights there. Before I got my ""essentials"" bag, which was just one of those small stringed backpacks, I would use deodorant and mouthwash/toothbrushes from the hygiene aisle to clean myself up until one day some random stranger bought me some toiletries. After that, a friend let me have a bag. My ""essentials"" bag contained said toiletries, my knife, my most current school ID and my wallet. That bag was kept on my person at all times.

I'm so thankful for all who have helped me when I needed it and the people who helped shaped me into the man I am today. Now I am 21 and for the first time in my life, live a stable, comfortable life in my own apartment. I've got 2 jobs, food in my fridge, a car, 401k and am happy with my life. It's truly been a journey and it's only up from here. "

"After discovering I had been cheated on (yet again), I posted an ad on craigslist professing my love for some other woman I'd never met, just watched casually at work. I was desperate for love, depressed, and honestly never thought she'd even read it. About a day later I got an email from some 'friend' of hers, very accurately describing who I had in mind, so I knew it was legit. Apparently my post scared the shit out of her and they considered calling the cops about it. I don't know what I was expecting to happen, but based on all the chick flicks I""d ever seen I was hoping for romantic, and not 'call the cops' scared. Never talked to her, never attempted to talk to her, and obviously never did anything so stupid since. "

"Alright, first year uni, in the dorms, this girl asks me to buy some tequila for her. Cool. show up at her place with 7 beers and a bottle of tequila, some of her friends there as well. We start doing shots of tequila, I hate tequila so I basically am pounding my beer to get rid of the taste, we finish the bottle and I'm finished all of my beers under two hours, my last memory is the group leaving her dorm. I was informed the next day that we all went back to my dorm, I started making out with the ugly girl in the group so everyone leaves and I end up fucking her, at one point my friend finds me in the bathroom trying to take a condom off, I ask him for help, he declines and tells me to get back in there and finish what I'm doing. I do then my room mate comes back and just barges in sees me going to town on this miniature troll and runs out, I run after him into another dorm room with like 6 people in it. Me standing there naked except for a condom tell my roommate to come back so I have an excuse to kick the girl out. He does. I then walk around naked trying to get people to smell my fingers, most decline. I'm then caught rubbing my eye with said finger followed by being grossed out that I was doing that. Eventually I put some pants on and end the night laying in bed with this super cute blonde hand feeding her M&amp;M's....with the fingers I had been getting everyone to smell.

TL; DR Blacked out on tequila, fucked a troll, met everyone in my dorm while nude. I have lots of NSFW stories for University but that was probably my craziest.

"I moved out of a place in Boston, and accidentally left a 300 dollar box of large format sheet film in the freezer.

I was essentially charged 750 dollars to move a box from the freezer to the trash.

"My marriage.

Deployment wise, I was driving a humvee and we parked for a bit on this little road in the farmlands. I was beside a canal. When it came time to move, the ground started to give way under the vehicle and we started to go into a canal. This canal was filled with water and I swear it was the perfect width of a humvee. We were basically getting ready to roll over.

Somehow by the grace of fucking whatever deity is out there the humvee managed to get out of there. Everyone behind us thought we were going in for sure. Our gunner bailed the gun truck because he thought we were going in which I don't blame him. He would have been crushed as we were rolling over. We had just lost four other dudes to those fucking canals the previous week.

"Lived out of my car for 6 months when I was 16 to get away from an abusive mother. The scariest part was worrying that the authorities would find out. I didn't want to end up in foster care, or forced back into that hell of living with my mother.  I still went to school, and I showered &amp; sometimes stayed over at friends houses if their parents were okay with it. If I thought friends parents were getting worried about me being over so much, I would sleep in my car. Sometimes friends would sneak me in and I would sleep on the floor of their bedrooms and sneak back out around 5 in the morning before their family woke. It was rough, but better than being abused and locked up at my mothers. Managed to get a job at a fast food place and eventually a friends church group found someone who rented me a small apartment at a discounted rent. Only went up from there. I finished high school and while I couldn't afford college, I consider myself more well off than ever. It was the scariest/hardest time of my life. "

"When I was around 15 years old I lived with my Vietnam vet dad on a pretty busy street in East LA. Car crashes were fairly common. You hear a screech, crunch, then you get the cordless phone (this was 1995), and some towels, walk outside, make sure everyone is okay, and call 911. Most of the time the people were shaken up, but okay. You help direct traffic, keep everyone calm until cops arrive.
  
Well, one day we hear a screech, then a *thud*, not a crunch. That means that *someone*, not something, got hit. We look outside and there's a woman on the road about 20 feet from the crosswalk. At the other end of the crosswalk was a tipped over baby carriage, with an infant on the pavement. This one was going to be bad.
  
Me and my dad did the routine. Grab the phone, and the towels. I never knew what the towels were for, but my dad told me that day in the most direct military way I've ever heard him speak. ""Grab two towels. I'll cover the two bodies.""
  
We run outside. The infant is crying. I never felt so relieved to hear a baby cry. An older woman picks up the baby from the gutter. My dad starts on her about moving injured people, but she saw the accident go down.
  
The woman was crossing the street pushing the baby carriage, saw the car coming, pushed the stroller toward the curb and took the full force of the car. The stroller rolled to the curb, and tipped the baby onto the asphalt. We didn't know if the baby was 100% okay to be picked up, but we had another person to look at.
  
The woman is alive, but beaten up pretty bad. She was missing teeth and bleeding from her mouth. Her knees and shins were scraped up so bad we could see bones. Her arm looked broken. She was aware, and crying. My dad told her to not move, and told all the bystanders not to move her. The whole time I'm on the phone with 911 relaying information that he's telling me. Her boyfriend shows up. He's a fully tatted gang member, crying like a baby, shoving people aside to get to his girlfriend. My dad stops him, but instead of saying ""you can't"", he said ""hold her left hand"". The guy drops to his knees and holds her hand until an ambulance arrives. We didn't need to use the towels that day.
  
We got word later on that she had a broken arm and shoulder, but she, and the baby, were going to be fine.
  
Later on in life I moved to an apartment right on Sunset Blvd in the junction, and once again car crashes became normal. I go through the motions that my dad taught me, but one morning a large pickup t-boned a sedan with 4 people making a left turn. I had to use my towels that day."

"Back when I was an medical intern in Pediatric Emergency Room, one weekend, we were packed with kids with gunshot wounds and 2nd-3rd degree burns. What had happened was that there was a birthday party for one of the kids, who happened to be the son of a cartel boss. Kids are having fun, adults are chatting and, all of a sudden, a convoy of ""enemy"" cartel start shooting up the place. A stray bullet hits a gas tank in the kitchen and it explodes.

&amp;nbsp;

Few dead kids and adults, a lot more injured. Kids crying because they're hurt and scared. Amongst the chaos, this one kid, chubby little 8 year old just sitting down on a hospital bed without a shirt. When the tank exploded, his dad got on top of him to protect him. His dad was in ICU for severe tracheal burns and this kid was in pediatric ER because he had 2nd and 3rd degree burns on his back, neck and right arm.

&amp;nbsp;

I went up to him and told him I needed to clean him up and wash some of the dead skin of his back, and it was going to hurt a lot. He looked at me and said, with a serious face: ""Alright, lets do it then"".  I told him I was going to scrub his back and it was going to sting, he just said: ""Yeah, that's okay"". I was suspecting it was the shock settling in, so I started to have a conversation with him (that's how I learned what had happened to his dad). He didn't complained a single time nor dropped any tears. He took it like a champ.

&amp;nbsp;

After I was done patching him up, I asked him: ""Are you sure you're okay?"" and he answered: ""I'm still alive, aren't I?"". Left me speechless. I still think about him every once in a while. "

One day I was out of my shave gel. So I looked in the bathroom cabinet and found the shaving foam stuff that my ex used for her legs. It was light and fruity smelling. I figured that today I was going to have a raspberry scented morning, no big deal.

That stuff did basically nothing. It somehow felt worse than shaving with nothing at all. It was painful.

Later that day I mentioned to her what I did. I suggested that the next time she shaved that she try my shave gel instead and that it would be much more comfortable for her. She refused. Flat out, no way in hell, never going to happen, refused. She acted like I asked her to move to North Korea and become radish farmers. I was baffled.

So kept on using that fruity smelling, do nothing, crap. Ok, fine by me. But I lost all sympathy for her when she would complain about how much it sucked to shave her legs. I offered her a better, cheaper, and overall more pleasant option but she wanted to choose fashion over function."

"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.*

*almost all problems are temporary.

Life is a roller coaster.

Source: have lived 63 years.

Let me add: Twice in my life I was very close to suicide myself. The first time was after 8 months of being ill, with no diagnosis. Left me weighing 96 pounds, impossibly thin, and with unmentionable symptoms. Turns out I had undiagnosed Grave's disease, an endocrine disorder. Once I got treatment...which was simple...I got better. (If you are feeling suicidal, be sure to get checked for all the endocrine disorders.....treatment and feeling better could be sip,e for you, too....)

Second time was at a very low time in my life. I was newly separated, and other unspeakable things were happening. Still, I hung on.

Now I am impossibly happy. Sounds ridiculous, but am 12.5 years into my honeymoon with my third husband. My 50s and 60s have been the best, most passionate, most juicy and fruitful and fun years of my life. Had I committed suicide, I would have completely missed ""La Dulce Vida."" Life is great, and should be for the next 20-30 years!!!

"We were out hunting with a group of guys. We were all about 100 yards from each other. The sun had set and darkness was quickly setting in.

After sitting for a few minutes this blood curdling howl comes from where the twig snapped. We dont live in an area with wolves....like at all. We have coyotes, but they dont make the same sound. 

My phone started blowing up with the other guys asking if I'd heard it. Yep, its nearly under my tree. It was so loud I could feel it in my chest. After about a half hour of silence I gathered all of my bravery, I bailed out of the tree, armed with a knife, and made my way to the group. 

We never saw it or heard it after that. It was one singular howl in an area that doesnt have wolves, on an island we've hunted for 10 years and never had anything like that happen. Still havent quite figured out where it came from or what exactly it was. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. "

"TL;DR: Almost blew up the building, had to hide from me to avoid a trip to the hospital.

Back in grad school I ended up being the senior grad student.  (Largely because my prof was an incompetent idiot and all the other senior grad students quit)  I was basically the lab manager in addition to handling my own research.  

Eventually, the prof hired a new grad student.  If I recall, his name was Matt.  Matt was one of those people whose default expression was slackjawed, gormless imbecility.  When you talked to him, gave advice or instruction, he'd just stare at you with this vacant expression and then just turn away, never acknowledging a thing you said.

Matt was a rolling disaster from pretty much day 1.  He constantly destroyed equipment - e.g.: he destroyed several hundred dollars of non-magnetic steel tweezers for TEM sample work by taking them all out of their custom carrying cases and just tossing them point down in a glass beaker, destroying their tips.  When called out on doing this, he just shrugged and wordlessly stared at me.

Oh, he also would bring in his shitty evangelical Christian rock music and play it on the lab stereo until I and the other students just got rid of the stereo to not have to listen to the crap.  And crappy not just because it was evangelical Christian music - it's not my thing at all but I'll grant that some of those bands can at least play well.  This crap was just awful.

I'm pretty sure the guy was a young Earther.

The final straw was one morning when I opened the lab up and walked in and nearly ran right into an unsecured gas cylinder sitting in the middle of the lab aisleway.   

To the uninitiated, gas cylinders **MUST** be secured when the heavy metal transport cap has been removed.  The gas outlet at the top is fairly delicate and if the cylinder falls over and that valve hits something, it will probably get torn off.  This turns a heavy metal gas cylinder into an uncontrolled rocket capable of punching through 6 inch concrete walls and turning people into red smears.  It's serious shit.  You do not remove the heavy metal transport cap until the cylinder is firmly attached to a sturdy wall clamp or other safety device.

This gas cylinder was just sitting in the middle of a walkway, with a gas regulator on it and a clear plastic tube trailing over to a bench - a perfect setup for a cylinder getting knocked over and causing a disaster.  To add insult to this, the fucking thing was literally a foot away from a cylinder tiedown I had mounted to one of the lab benches.

After my heart started again, I *carefully* walked up to the cylinder, grabbed it in a bear hug and slowly walked it over to the clamp and secured it.  Once I'd safed the cylinder, I examined it to try and figure out what was going on.  That's when I saw what gas was in it.

Hydrogen.

The *unsecured* gas cylinder was full of hydrogen.  If it had fallen over and hit the regulator on any of the benches all around it, it would have turned into a rocket that would have started punching holes through walls all through a busy building with over 50 scientists working in it and leaving behind a trail of hundreds of cubic feet of explosive hydrogen gas.  Any flame or spark would have then detonated the hydrogen gas like a fuel air explosive bomb.  This thing could easily have killed most of the people in the building.

At this point, I'm on the warpath.  I'm seeing red.  I storm over o the neighboring building where some of the other grad students were at and demanded to know who had done such a mind-bogglingly stupid thing.  They were all pretty appalled and told me it wasn't them.  But one mentioned that good 'ol Matt had been talking about needing hydrogen gas for some nanoparticle reduction experiments.

Now keep in mind that this sort of experiment needs maybe a few cubic feet of hydrogen gas - a tiny fraction of the volume of the full sized ~~bomb~~cylinder that had been in the lab.  He could have just ordered a tiny benchtop-sized lecture bottle that is far safer and had more than enough gas.  

At that point, I wanted blood.  I spent the next hour or so scouring the three buildings of my department, looking for Matt, ready to beat the living shit out of him the minute I laid eyes on him.  I'm pretty sure the other grad students warned him to make himself scarce.

After I couldn't find him, I went to the prof and basically told him that it was either me or Matt.  Matt 'left' a week or so later and I never saw him again.

Matt, if you ever read this, you're a stupid, irresponsible sack of shit that nearly killed an entire building full of people and if I ever see you again, I'll punch your slack-jawed, proto-humanoid face out the back of your skull."

"Honest advice here. Make an action plan so that one day you can.

I did it when I was younger, ended up moving back and regret it on a regular basis.

1. Make a ""Get out of town"" bank account. Once you hit about $500-1k you're in the clear depending on lifestyle needs. (Does not include travel)
2. Figure out basic jobs you can get. Hotels are great, especially seasonal hotel jobs. They hire anyone and always hire from out of town.
3. Learn to cook. It's the cheapest way to live.
4. Learn to budget.
5. Sell your stuff, almost all of it. Figure out how little you can live with. There are a lot of things to do in most towns, so stuff isn't as important.

The best time is to do it in the spring or fall. Seasonal jobs are usually hiring at that point.

Do not blow the money you make your first year or two. After a while it's going to be rough on low income.

Honestly though, do it. You'd be surprised to learn that a lot of people do this and it's not as hard as you would think.

"My best friends older sister did this at her wedding. 

They were going to have lots of booze, lots of dancing and music inappropriate for a childs ears. She really was looking out for them. 

She was sure to put all this necessary information into the invitations, and everyone seemed in agreement. The invitations were sent a month in advance to be sure everyone with kids could find a babysitter and would be able to come. Everyone was good except for this one lady, we'll call her A.

A had six kids, and all of them were motherfucking devil's childs. Bad attitudes, no discipline, everything you'd expect from a mother like she was. 

Well, A calls my friends sister and explains to her, three days before the wedding, might I add; that she cannot get a babysitter and so she *has* to bring the kids with her. She says they promised to behave, she got them each nice clothes, etc. 

Bride explains that there was a strict no-kids policy, so then if she couldn't find a babysitter, that she was out of luck and if she couldn't come they understood. 

This clearly made A mad, but she just said okay and then hung up. Bride thought everything was good, until A showed up at the wedding with 6 lil fuckers behind her. The best man and maid of honor stepped in very quickly and told her the kids weren't allowed, and that they couldn't stay. This set her off, she just started screaming and even took to throwing herself on the ground and begging for them to just let them stay. Still received a firm, 'nope', and then only thing that would shut her up was when the Groom finally came out and told her to leave, or the police would be called.

But after they left the wedding was fun. "

"We were hospital aides on an inpatient floor. So we changed incontinent patients, did vitals, helped patients walked to and from the bathroom or chairs, that kind of stuff. Nurses depended on us to do our jobs so they could do theirs.

This girl would avoid doing any work she could. She'd constantly hide in one of the back nursing stations and hunker down where she couldn't be seen and read. She'd ignore callbells for select patients who were known to be incontinent and messy. Just sit and read while the bell went off and wait for one of the others to grab it. She was allotted a 30min break and constantly took up to an hour. When she was training a new girl, she encouraged the same work avoidance behavior. 

Then she got busted for falsifying vitals. She was upset that she couldn't take her break on her schedule, so when she did go she was gone for an hour and a half. She came back after the second round of vitals for her shift was due, so instead of getting her ass in gear she *made them up*. Manually typed bullshit into the computer instead of taking vitals on the machine and saving them (they went to a Wi-Fi cloud to the chart)

What ended up happening was she put an average blood pressure measurement (think 130/85) on a patient whose normal parameters were about 90/60. So the nurse sees this, notice the patients blood pressure is 40 points higher than it should be, so she gives him a dose of BP meds. His BP tanks, the patient nearly dies. It's a shitshow.

She gets busted because our heart monitor tech suspected what had happened, gathered ALL the vitals machines and printed out copies of every set of vitals that had been taken that evening. Even if you don't save it to the cloud under a patients name, the machine saves it. 

None of the numbers matched the ones this girl put in the computer which proved she hadn't done her job. Who knows how long she'd been doing that without getting caught. We'd get busy and lose track of her all the time.

Because of that tech the nurse wasn't in trouble and that aide got fired. Good Riddance. 

ETA: she wasn't prosecuted. I strongly believe she should have. My bosses thought it was embarrassing and figured firing her was enough. 

The day she was fired we had a prescheduled employee meeting, an hour before the eveninf shift started. She was late to that and was floated to another unit, so flounced off before the bosses could say ""wait wait"". So she takes her purse to another unit. Gets called back, gets shown the evidence and she confesses and is fired. Has to walk back to the other unit to get her purse. Has to walk to our unit to get her coat and empty her locker. Had to wait for security to take her ID. The entire time she is sobbing. She wore a lot of makeup and looked a disaster.

It ended up being very public and embarrassing for her. The entire small hospital knew. 

She still deserved to be charged. But damn I hoped she learned something. "

"Most Americans are only one accident away from financial ruin.

Edit, because it was inevitable that the naysay bootstrap warriors would show up:
90% of people have health insurance, but I would say an enormous portion of them have out of pocket maximums higher than their take home or have such poor coverage that the insurance basically covers the stamp for their bills. I have only a small sampling of several thousand per year to go off of in a state where we have good coverage as a whole, and the situation still is grim, so take my opinion with a block of salt if needed.

It's particularly this kind of argument *why* we have these problems in the American health system. All coverage is not the same, is certainly not equal, and does not insure the patient against disease except what the insurance thinks is acceptable. Providers either have to be aware specifically what insurance covers for what diagnosis- a lot are pegged against CMS but not always- and if patients don't call ahead of time, they get stuck with the uncovered portion.

I don't care that it seems like I'm yelling at clouds. I work in diagnostic healthcare, I deal with insurance and I've had a lot of post-baccalaureate education on dealing with payments and coverage. The system is overwhelming complicated, and the biggest supporters of this broken system are ironically the type of people who like ""free market"" and ""small government"" with something like healthcare. I wish it didn't have to be personal opinion to think that healthcare could be a benefit of society instead of a good traded to the lowest bidder.

Edit two: you are the good being traded. Hopefully that helps clear the confusion."

"I once had to do the heimlich maneuver on myself... while seated at the dinner table with around 10 family members.

I'd choked on a large hunk of bacon fat that had clung to a pork medallion.  It lodged good, couldn't get air in or out, so I first waved my hands... nothing.  Then I pounded on the plate, everyone just stared at me.

So, having just learned the heimlich maneuver (and how to do it to yourself) in the BSA I got up, went around the back of my chair, and forced it out myself.

After a large hunk of bacon fat plopped onto my plate everyone just looked at me like ""WTF is wrong with you???"" and I said ""couldn't anyone tell I was choking???"" and they just laughed ""Oh, we'd *know* if you were choking!"".

Apparently they all think you can cough and wheeze if you're choking.  If you're genuinely choking though you can't get **any** air in or out.  In fact, I was taught if there's any air you don't do the heimlich maneuver because it technically isn't choking at all.

Edit: I should add that every time I did something to grab attention I then made the choking sign.  They just refused to believe I was actually choking, before I coughed it up and after."
"I find that most major retailers that are involved in any kind of seemingly altruistic cause is duplicitous and done for PR. I work for a major supermarket chain that went ""green"" a few years ago. We compost now, recycle our plastic, and such. The thing is the company doesn't do that because it's the right thing to do, but instead, we do it because we sell the compost for profit and get a very large ""green"" tax-break. In the end, I'm glad we do it. The outcome is more important than the dubious motives. "

"The girl wanted to ""prank"" another girl on our floor by putting her roommate's bra on their door handle, but mistakenly put it on my friend's door.  Friend and I noticed it and we're like, ""Huh, that's weird.""  I then off-handedly said, ""It would be funny if someone shat on that bra.""  Without a word, my friend immediately grabbed the bra, a plastic bag, went into the bathroom and crapped all over it.

The bra's owner (who was not involved in the ""prank"" at all) went around the floor asking where her bra was.  Seeing how upset she was and that she was getting the RA's involved, my friend and I realized bra shitting was a huge mistake, and we fessed up.  Since the RA was already in the mix, he had to report it to Student Life, and they decided the crime was worthy of expulsion of the perpetrator.

The girl was like WTF my bra got dumped on, but she was cool with my buddy and didn't want him to get kicked out of school.  She testified for him at the ""trial"", which I'm sure helped keep him in school."

"I lived in a 2-story house, which was quite old. It had piped steam heating, and one of the issues was that when the heat came on, the pipes expanded(?), causing a weird knocking sound, as if someone was walking in high heels. My bedroom was in the lower floor, and the living room (and entrance) above.

One night I had a girl that I had recently met over and it was her first time  at my place. It was late, we were getting frisky, then started doing it. She was on top, riding away. I was having a good time, to say the least. Unbeknownst to me, the heat had come on. So suddenly the knocking starts, and she gets this horrified look on her face, hastily gets up and starts getting dressed. I was so used to the knocking that it didn't even register anymore. 

So I'm like, ""what happened? What did I do??""

And she replied, ""Your wife is here! I heard her walk in upstairs!!""

And I'm like.. what wife? I live alone!

Soon it dawned on me what had happened, and we both had a good laugh.

TL;DR: got interrupted by the heat kicking in."

I actually remember seeing her stroke one when she was much smaller. I freaked out and got ready for the scream but the bee was chill as anything. I think she has a special bond with them.

"I've got a recent one. We'd only been talking for a few days, so at this point there is no commitment, or anything really, beyond a confirmed mutual interest. Immediately I noticed she was getting a bit clingy, in that she wanted to talk on the phone several times a day. So I'm already in ""establishing boundaries"" mode right off the bat. Anyway, I was walking home from the store, it had just started raining, and my phone battery was almost dead. I had just enough charge left to listen to an audiobook, but not enough for a phone call. This is when she calls me.

I begin to explain that I'm walking in the rain and my battery's dead, and that I'll call her when I get home. I didn't get to finish the sentence, because she starts in with, ""Look if you don't want to talk to me, just say it and quit wasting my time."" Oh, no you fucking didn't just lay a guilt trip on me for being soaking wet and miserable on the side of the road with a dead battery. I shot back with, ""Don't you *even* start that shit with me or I'll never speak to your ass again."" She hung up. That sealed the deal.

My battery did in fact die on the way home. I log into Facebook and there's already three messages from her. The first one is angry, the next one is apologetic, and the third one is promising never to start drama again. I just blocked her. I check the phone and there's a bunch of similar texts. She kept texting for a few days after that and eventually gave up. I didn't read any of them.

Word to the wise: if there are two ways to interpret your motives, and someone always chooses the interpretation that leads to drama, get the fuck away. There was no winning in that situation, and that's how it always goes with people like that. If you're the trusting sort like me, the tendency is to take their complaints at face value and try to make things better the next time. It will never happen. I've wasted a lot of time on people like that, and I was pretty proud of myself for finally recognizing those head games on sight and putting a stop to it immediately."
"Whatever it is, I always spice it up with saffron."
"I was applying for my first teaching job and openings were few and far between. I applied to 13 different districts, sent countless cover letters and resumes and could not get an interview. This was in the early 90's when you had to drop things off in person. It was time consuming and a lot of work.  Eventually, after a year of subbing and searching I began to add odd creative tidbits to my resume like kick boxing. 

Finally I wrote, ""Has the ability to communicate with cats.""  

Got an interview and it was the first thing they asked me about. I laughed and then answered the question straight faced. Got the job. "
"Was working at a summer camp and we happened to be on minimal staff that week. That particular day the camp director had left for supplies so after I finished working and had dinner I went to one of the cabins that had a land line to call a friend. Cell phone reception was next to nonexistent in that location (we were wedged between a couple of mountains).

So it's late twilight, almost nightfall, when I head back to my cabin. As I come around the flagpole I discover I'm not alone: lumbering past the swimming pole is a large black bear.

I stop, thinking ""Oh crap. A bear.""

The bear stops twelve feet away and looks back. I could swear it's thinking ""Oh crap. A human.""

For a long moment we stand off looking at each other. So I'm shining my flashlight at this wild animal. Totally alone, unarmed. We knew this bear had been visiting our camp because each morning the dumpster was tipped over. It never got into the dumpster, but it tipped it over all the same--just to try to get inside. It was making a beeline to the dumpster when we crossed paths. No one had ever seen this animal face to face before. It's about twice my size.

So what am I going to do now?

At that moment the bear turned and left the camp, walking directly away from me.

Years before at a park ranger educational lecture, the advice had been to stand your ground and keep your cool if you end up face to face with a bear. It worked.

Don't know if you would call that creepy or mysterious, but it earned massive respect from the kids once the campers arrived. Somebody told them that I had driven away a bear by myself and that made me the most badass adult in those kids' world. OK, I'll take that. Not a kid talked back at me all summer. Kept my mouth shut about what I actually thought I had done--which was stand shining a flashlight for about fifteen seconds feeling like a dumbass because I couldn't think of anything better to do."

"One time, I was over at my best friend's house while his parents were out at a family party.  While he was off getting baked, I pretended to leave, but instead snuck into his parent's room.  I always had a thing for his crack-whore of a mom, and I wanted to do a bit of snooping.  Anyways, I was about half-way through his Mom's underwear drawer, when I heard footsteps.  In a split second, I did the only thing I could do.  I grabbed one of his Mom's wigs and hopped into bed, hoping he'd mistake me for his Mom.

The disguise worked a little too well.  My best friend hops right into bed with 'his Mom...'  I couldn't let him know it was me - how on Earth would I explain the lying and snooping???  The wig might work from a distance or from behind, but in bed...

So, I did the only thing I could do - I buried my face.  In the only place available:  his crotch.  And justified it in the only way I could.  I pretended that I was his mother, and that I was so stoned that I thought it was my husband who'd just jumped into bed with me.

The dogs were the only ones who knew what was up (other than my best friend's cock anyways).  Luckily, I was able to shoo them away without anyone being the wiser.  

My friend's a raging homophobe too.  If he only knew..."

Luckily for me I caught a break, ended up in a psych ward after a short time homeless and had a few contacts to get me home to New England.

Edit: I just remembered this episode and looking back it was kind of a poignant moment, dead of night maybe 2 am on the A train where I shared a car with six homeless guys all passed out drunk or high, the smell of shit, everything you could imagine that car to be like and what dawned on me was one of the most glaringly obvious lessons life has ever presented me with, as I realized it wasn't six homeless guys and me.

Dude cheated on his gf with her best friend and the two of them decided to get together,  so they sat down with the original gf to inform her - she asked to have the appartment she and her bf had lived in (which was admittedly a lovely appartment), but was told that ex-bf and ex-bff intended to start living there together basically as soon as she'd finished moving out. She conceded, and asked to have it to herself for a weekend instead, just to move her stuff out and have some time to herself before she'd move out temporarily. The exes agree, and that weekend the ex-gf proceeds to enjoy some bottles of wine, some seafood- and then stuffs the curtain rods with every leftover she has, plus her ex's favourite treat: caviar (she left a can of the stuff in the fridge). Afterwards, the exes move in and proceed to make it their little love-pad, but it doesn't take long for them to realize something's amiss (although it takes them a while to realize it's the stench that's steadily growing stronger), and from there on cracks start appearing in their relationship, etc etc- in the end, the ex-bf gets back in contact with the scorned ex-gf, and he sells her the much coveted appartment for a fraction of the original price (bonus: he had the whole place renovated in an attempt to find the source of the smell, so she got an awesome deal out of it). He couldn't figure out why she kept cracking up when she came to pick up the keys, nor her preoccupation with the curtain rods (he had put new ones in for the sale) "

My father had a precious set of old, inexpensive kitchenware that his late mother gave him before he even married my mother. When the divorce went to mediation and she told the mediator that she wanted those pots and pans, she got them. She got them because she was willing to give up something else of equal monetary value (so, something worth less than $10), and was willing to sit in mediation for hours, racking up thousands in lawyer fees for both sides, until my father consented. Again, an even financial trade, but a sentimental trade of overwhelming disparity. Just as a final ""fuck you."""

"I have to make a throwaway for this, because ya.

When I was like 14 - I was curious about different ways to 'stimulate' myself... and had come across straight/bi/gay porn at some point.

At night, I decided to see ""what does it feel like having something up your butt"" - so I took a toothbrush, and put it in my butt while I JO'd.

...I took it out, and it looked nasty.  I forgot to do anything with it.

About an hour later, my brother goes ""YO WTF HAPPENED TO MY TOOTHBRUSH!?""

The brush end was spotless, but the whole other part was recently in my butt hole.

I just said it fell in the toilet &gt;.&lt; not sure if he believed me."
"I have two good ones. 

One: I was looking at my ipod touch while sitting on my parents motorcycle in the garage. The pipes were hot and I didn't realize it. My leg was rested up against the pipe and when it made contact it was so hot that it killed the nerve endings. When I got up, my skin was still on the pipe. I didn't know what to do. It took months to heal, and the feeling is now back after ten years. 

That burn was disgusting because it was right on my calf and it was hard to heal because it kept scabbing up, and the scabs would break into pieces and ooze. I'm always citations around motorcycle pipes now. 


Two: When I was in middle school I loved staying up all Friday night playing video games with my friends until the morning of the next day. I would try and see how long I could stay awake. 

One day when my parents were out of town I stayed up, and the next morning I was hungry. After rummaging through the pantry I found a bag of assorted Hershey's chocolates. I grabbed a knife and cut into the bag. Only, I didn't just get the bag. I stabbed the knife straight into my index finger. It instantly started bleeding. It was deep and I wasn't sure what to do. I started rinsing it in the sink while applying pressure. 

As I stood there I realized my vision was getting faint. The sight of blood pouring out of the cut after checking to see if it was done made me weak in the knees. I had tunnel vision and it funneled into blackness. I had blacked out and fell backwards in the kitchen. I woke up to the feeling of my warm pee filling my boxers."

"We love each for other reasons than the key gap. So in the end we get past this.

Gap - she has an MSc Management - I have no degree and did not go to university.

Gap 2 - she is a lady of leisure - I work and earn a lot of money with no degree.

The only time it becomes an issue is talking about future child's education. She is adamant that we force our kid into university. I am against the forcing - if kid wants university great. If kid would rather do a private professional qualification/ apprenticeship then ok.

I am only going to stop my child from ""doing nothing that coild better their life"".

Wife hates that, I think she sees it as a dig at her saying her degree is not worth anything. She is not from the UK so can't understand even after marrying me how a lot of people can excel in the UK without degrees.

So we either argue about it infrequently or do not talk about it. Tbf there is no point in talking about it until we have a sense of what child and their abilities theh have.

Apart from that - we enjoy lots of the same things and share the same views and have the same life goals - our own home, a child, a pet, travelling to see the world a new place each year, taking care of

"I dated literally one of the dumbest fucks in America.

We'll call her 'A'

A was a special breed of stupid. 

She thought pizza was an animal. No, seriously. she thought there were pizza hunters.

She liked to pick up cigarette butts off the ground and pretend to smoke them in front of passing by cars. 

She thought Tylenol and crack were close enough to be the same drug. And would tell everyone she had to take crack pills for her headaches

Thought resident evil games were based on real life events. 

Though the thing that caused our break up was when she called me, crying, sobbing, screaming that she was pregnant with another guy's kid. Turns out she thought making out got you pregnant. 

Edit: I forgot another thing, me and my family legitimately make this joke to this day still.

We were out really late, and didn't have time to really go out to dinner before we went home, my parents were with us. and she bought a sandwich. A decided she wanted it warm and decided to microwave it.

She put it in for FIVE GOD DAMN MINUTES I SWEAR TO FUCK. We had no idea and it was like, almost liquidated because the bread had been in there so long. 

Now whenever you fuck up a meal we say ""You A'ed that right up."" Only, her actual name rather than the letter. "

Her Instagram bio includes ""Aspiring trophy wife"", and she brags about how much money he spends on her. Here's the real kicker: she's cheated on him with three dudes already.

He doesn't care. He's beginning to cut out family and friends for her, and he's even said that, after only six months of dating, that he's going to take her ring shopping.

Everyone he knows, including his family, friends, acquaintances, and myself don't approve of her. But he's completely blinded by her."

"As someone who's snuck all kinds of things into festivals I'll tell you what works for me. Find out what you are permitted to bring in. Water, Gatorade etc. In my case they let you bring in drinks if they are unopened and have plastic wrap over them. I used blue Gatorade since they made you open up water bottles (no shrink wrap). I drilled a small hole in the bottom, drained the Gatorade and added blue foodcoring to a bottle of rum. Then I sealed the hole in the bottom with clear 5 minute epoxy (non toxic when cured). If you drill the hole in the right spot it's almost impossible to see,  not that they are really checking anyway. The only hard part is getting the booze into the small hole. I think last time I made 2 holes to let air in while filling. 

The Gatorade I use comes in a 4 pack, only one was rum. It wasn't hard to color match, just don't use any of the ice flavors b3cause they are milky and can't be reproduced using just food coloring.   

Edit: for weed just use a pack of cigarettes. Hollow out a cigarette, leave a little tobacco in the bottom so you don't accidentally smoke the filter. Fill it with weed leaving a some room at the tip. Then pack a little tobacco at the tip so you can't see the weed. It's almost undetectable and if you don't like the taste of tobacco just break the tip off before you light it.  "

I can't imagine how many streets He drove down in our city trying to find my car. I found this out because He complimented a dress I was wearing one day...He texted me something like""I just drove by your house, I like your dress""... He messaged me once, asking me if I was dating ""a black guy"" because he saw me talking to my neighbor. I stopped communication at that point. Apparently a mistake: From there he was able to figure out what I did exactly for work and even followed me there on a few occasions...nearly an hour away!! One day as I'm enjoying my lunch, I get a text message asking me how my smoothie is...like wtf...he's watching me! I blocked that guy and quit that job so fast.

"Routine.  My kid now goes to a Montessori school part time three days a week.  On days he goes to school, I get up, get him ready, and drop him off.  When I get home, I eat breakfast and internet for a bit.  Then I deal with dishes/laundry/finances/yardwork/etc.  After I go get him, the rest of the day is spent doing stuff together.

On days he stays home and she works, we get up and eat breakfast together.  He watches cartoons while I clean up from breakfast, then we go to they YMCA.  I exercise while he hangs out in the childcare room.  After the Y, we run any errands we have on the way home.  When we get home, we snack and then do something together.  Either games, or books, or the park, or arts and crafts, or whatever.

As a result of routine, most of my days with him resemble workdays.  We do what we do and fill the day in a relatively predictable manner.

On days where we are all home together, we all do stuff together.  If she is home and he is at school, I'll do something with my wife.  Or maybe she'll take care of her own business and I'll do my own thing.

In my idle time when I'm not busy and not doing something with him or her, I pursue my hobbies.  I homebrew, play golf, play games, and work on teaching myself French.  Lately I have been watching more TV than I used to, which is something I kind of lapsed into on idle days.  I recognize that that is a bad habit, so I'm working on filling that time with other things.  The important thing is that you should treat your home duties as a job, and not let your leisure time get in the way of it.  I try not to just lounge around when there is laundry and stuff to do, but it happens.  The key is not letting it happen too often.

I think that the biggest thing is that I'm very independent.  I have no problem entertaining myself or filling my days with things, so I never really feel bored or unfulfilled.  If you are the type of person who can find something to do on your own, you'll be fine."

You never really knew if the answer was no, or you just didn't ask the right people.

Libraries helped with some questions, like ""What general won the war of whoopsiedot in 1650"", but how about ""Was there ever a General called General Boobface?"" What, are you going to read every single military history book in the library?

So it's not just that information is quicker and easier to access, in a lot of cases it's the fact that there even is a way at all to access the information at all. There are few questions google can't answer.

I worked with a man who had hallucinations so terrifying to him that he poked his own eyes out. He always wore sunglasses but once he was comfortable with me he showed me his empty eyesockets. He was a very sweet man but would get violent sometimes. A different social worker in his past had taught him to warn people when he was about to be violent so he could be left alone to calm down. It worked suprisingly well. He would also frequently pull his toenails and fingernails off but never could put the reason into words for me.

I was in Miami last year and got into an uberpool as the broke college student I am. The driver picks a severely overweight woman on her 40s, that was really drunk. She was latina  and didn't have the best English. 

She asks me where I was going and I tell her to Miami beach. She starts telling me she was set to get married in Miami Beach next month, but her Fiance died. She said she moved with her fiance's parents because her fiance was taking care of her sick mom, but after he died her parents asked her to move out, and don't  give her money for important stuff (like alcohol). She said her fiance was 23, she said "" I like young guys, how old are you papi?"". She moved closer to my side of the backseat , and I answered ""22"" while looking at my phone. She asked a couple of other things but I kept looking at my phone, and answering as shortly as possible. She apparently took the hint, so she started trying to impress me.

She said she was born in Nicaragua, and went to a school full of geniuses that prepares them to rule the world. She also said that Trump wants to build a Chinese wall to keep all the Chinese away, and that the real reason why the US has nukes is because they have been bombing the arctic to steal the oil. She told me how this school taught them how to seduce presidents, and how to rule countries. But she couldn't deal with the pressure her parents put her through on that school, she did not want to be president of Nicaragua, so she decided to escape and ran to the US.

I told the driver I needed to drop me at a CVS because I forgot I needed to buy something, and then walked 35 minutes to my home  because I was so uncomfortable with the situation.

Edit: Made small changes to make it easier to follow. Spanish is my first language, so I was trying really hard during this trip to not reveal it, because I was scared of what she might say if she was talking in her first language."

"Spoiler of what I think is the best part of the movie:

Favorite part of the movie for me is about 2/3 of the way through. When he thinks he makes it out of the room for a couple of days, then goes to mail his book. The construction crew guys start hammering away at the walls in the mail room, to reveal the haunted room and he realizes he is still stuck in the room.

I felt that the movie did a good job in playing this out. The second he was ""out"" of the room, I was thinking to myself that the room was just playing a trick on him. However, they dragged it out just long enough that it got me second guessing myself and just then he walks into the post-office.

Also enjoyed the ending with the tape recorder."

"Well, nobody's really heard of him, but I'll say it was my wife's uncle.

He was a great guy. Never married or had any kids but he loved every single one of his nephews and nieces and played a huge role in their lives.

He was always there to help his friends and family out. He was one of those guys that could fix or build anything, and was forever helping someone do renovations or car repairs. 

Never made a lot of money, but he always had a little bit of cash in his pocket. Had very simple tastes, and it was more than enough to do the things he liked to do -- watch sports on TV, buy a cool gadget once in a while, and give his family inexpensive but practical gifts. 

He ate and drank all he wanted, and smoked a pack a day. Was never sick in his life, never went to the doctor.

Dies in his sleep at 62 of a heart attack (yes, consequence of smoking etc). No hospital, no chemo, no long drawn out process, just dies with a smile on his face. The whole neighborhood came to his funeral. Even though he wasn't my direct relative, I cried like a baby.

"I was home alone with my sister. I was eleven and my sister was fourteen. We had just gotten home from school and we were new to the concept of being home alone. My younger brother had left his bike out on the stoop by our front door as he had always had a tendency to do. I was practicing piano when I heard someone knock on the door. I went downstairs and saw a woman dressed in all black with black sunglasses outside the door. I opened it and she said hello. She told me she was looking for her son and that he might possibly be playing in the neighborhood. I was confused and asked what her son's name was. She insinuated by looking at the bike that her son might be playing with my brother, but would not give a name. I called my sister who also approached the door. The woman was very deadpan and gloomy. She just kept asking if we had seen her son. We finally were freaked out enough and slammed the door closed. I ran to a window to see what was happening outside after we had shut the door in her face. The lady stood at the door for about five mins. She didn't move. She just stood silently. She then slowly walked to her car and got in. It was a black car. She backed out of our driveway and onto the street, where she proceeded to sit and idle for more time. I remember frantically not understanding what to do. During this time, my sister and I were scared. We knew our brother was in school still and that his bike had just been parked there. We didn't understand who this was or what to do. We were unsure to call 911 because there were two daycare houses close to where we lived. Stupid me found my baseball bat and we sat watching her car until we saw our mother's car approaching. When our mother's car pulled in our driveway, her car sped off immediately. Our mom didn't believe us when we told her about the weird encounter. I still remember how deadpan and off-putting the woman was. I don't know what really to believe."

"As a woman who did a fair amount of online dating, this is the nightmare of it all. You do, indeed, get dozens if not hundreds of replies (particularly when you are fresh meat and fit into a certain demographic that is easily searchable). But almost all of the messages you receive have no content. Just ""Hiya! You seem cute. Let's chat."" and ""Hello there, check out my profile!"" Over and over again.

Men quickly come to feel that (to some extent correctly) that it is a numbers game, and go for massive numbers of attempts over spending much time on content or looking through profiles. One gets the impression that anyone who seems pretty much OK (nice looking, young enough) is worth a quick shout without much more thought to the matter. And that and once a guy starts a conversation with with a woman, then he can further judge her datability. Hence the deluge of almost identical, and almost meaningless, emails that comes to a lot of women.

Yet, if you are woman who feels she is serious about the process, you feel compelled to look at every single one of these messages to see if one makes it sound like he read your profile and really might like something about you as an individual. Or, secondarily, you hope to go to their profile as they suggest and see something that doesn't look like all the others, something that makes you feel like it might be a connection.

As a result it is TON of work on both sides, when I don't think it really needs to be.

I did meet my husband online, and the process was oddly simple, mostly because (as I would find out later) he knows absolutely nothing about what are supposed to be the unwritten rules of dating and gender. So we didn't do that whole weird dance in the first place."

As a girl, if you're having a bad day and clearly aren't happy about it, another girl will ask you what's wrong, and you vent together, and you gossip about things together, and you can text about it later, and there's always someone to talk to.

I'm a guy, and I was having a tough time earlier in the year. I had a reputation for being lively and outgoing at work, so when my mood changed, it was obvious. I was still nice to everyone, but I didn't go out of my way to talk to them as often. And instead of people asking me about why that might be, they all started avoiding me. It would be more accurate to say they almost got mad at me for it. I had a female friend who I only spoke to through Facebook messages, and I talked to her a little about how I was feeling. She was clearly uncomfortable and changed the subject as quickly as possible. One person even gave me the ""other people have it worse, so your problems don't matter"" speech.

I got the impression that they felt like the victims, because I was making their day worse by having a bad day myself. My relationship with my coworkers never recovered. And I don't really have anyone else to talk to about things, so I just make a throwaway and vent anonymously on Reddit when I have something I really want to say.

"**Bad Ass Beans And Rice**

It's cheap and tastes great. Just like your girlfriend.

Ingredients:

* Red pepper, red onion, red tomato, all diced

* 3 TBSP cooking oil - olive, vegetable, baby, whatever

* 2 to 12 garlic cloves, depending on your level of bravery, and if you'll have to talk to another human being in the next 48 hours. I telecommute, so I can eat a whole head of garlic if I want. You can't stop me.

* 1 can of black beans

* 2 tbsp oregano

* 2 tbsp cumin

* 1/4 to 1 tsp cayenne pepper, or 1 finely chopped jalapeno.

* 1 tbsp lime juice

* 2 cups rice

* 3 cups chicken broth

Cooking:

Cook the rice in the chicken broth. Sometimes I'll boil some eggs in there, too, to make egg salad the next day.

Take the onion and pepper, and crush the garlic, and throw them in the pot with the oil. Cook them in the oil until the onion is shiny.

Add the cooked rice and all the other shit, except for the lime juice. Simmer for 20 minutes or until your wife gets home and asks if dinner is ready, whichever is first.

Once everything is done, add the lime juice. Salt and pepper to taste.

Guacamole, salsa, sour cream, etc., are all good additions. Also, it's a good idea to have cheese and tortillas on hand to turn the leftovers into burritos.

Also, if you've got time, roasting a head of garlic in the oven gives it a milder, sweeter taste, which is a nice change. Just chop off a bit of the non-stem end, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in tin foil, and stick in the oven for an hour on about 350. Makes the kitchen smell great. Amazing on toast, too.

1) Quite recently I was watching Netflix while doing the dishes. I had a dirty gross knife in my hand and was watching some comedy special. Without paying attention to what I was doing, I started flicking the knife about, spinning it with my index and middle finger. Sure enough, it leapt from my hand and stabbed my tit. Not deep, but it bled through my shirt.

2) A long time ago, I found a grapefruit sized rock and wanted to smash it open and have a geode (a friend brought in a geode for show and tell the other day and I was all about geodes.)

So I take the rock to my front yard where we have these big decorative rocks, like beanbag chair sized, and thunder slam the rock as hard as I could against the bigger rock. It ricocheted with white hot child hating fury, and brained the fuck out of me.

"Being a girl from California, what is a ""fake Cali accent""?"
Seems nice of them to not press charges.
"Yep, this was my answer. Rape. Definitely rape. 

The thing is, being a girl (I was 15/16) made it more likely that a guy of means would be willing to give me his couch for the night. Unfortunately, that generosity came with a statistical likelihood that some rapey shit was probably going to happen. So the choice of 'Do I risk putting myself in a potentially rapey situation, or just go out in the woods and find a secluded place to lay my head for 5 hours' wasn't really as cut and dry as my homeless male counterparts used to think. 9 times out of 10, I'd just choose the woods.

"I *am* actually a good brother, but not because I beat my sister's rapist. No, the worst part is after it was over and I had time to examine my feelings on the matter, I realized that I didn't do it for her. I did it for *me*, to make myself feel better. And then it hit me that I *enjoyed* decimating that guy, and that shocked me into realizing I should never, ever commit violence like that again because I'd become addicted to it. In the end it did nothing to make my sister feel better. All I did was ruin a promising young college football player's chances at a career, not that I gave a shit - he hurt my sister. I've never held illusions about what I did being virtuous, but the experience did give me insight into how dark I can become if need be.

I don't want this to sound like I'm a great humanitarian or that I'm trying to humblebrag what I do, but I've been buying food and drinks (it's summer and hot out!) for the guys I see.

"The key is to get a fluffy waffle, real maple syrup, and whipped butter.  Combine that with a meaty few pieces of fried chicken breast strips (this will draw the most disagreement, but I prefer the strips over bone-in breast for this), and a thinner, somewhat spicy and mildly smoky bbq sauce.

The combination of a salty, smoky, crispy, spicy dish right next to an sweet, savory, airy, carby dish is what makes it.

"I ended up meeting some people by chance that had been friends of my older brothers years prior. They offered me a room and i moved in there. Unfortunatly as these stories go it didnt go well as they were drug dealers. My family wasnt aware of my situation as i lived in a different city. My father came and picked me up to go to my parents new place for christmas and i was offered to move back in with them. I returned home after christmas to someone doing cocaine in my room and about a month later accepted his offer. Im 5'11 and was 120 lbs when i moved back home. I survived by asking people for quarters to make a phone call and using that to buy mr noodles (Canadian Ramen) and i took advantage of my high school having 1 free oatmeal packet per student that wanted one every morning. Most people dont get as lucky as i did. You dont know how cold a Canadian Winter can get until you spend it sleeping on benches, empty ice shacks, under gazebos and one i dont admit to people in person... i spent most nights curled up inside a doghouse of a family that didnt have a dog anymore.

I ended up telling my dad that my uncle wasn't home. 

About 3 years later though my uncle and his wife got divorced. His ex-wife got custody of their teenage kids and moved them into another state. She doesn't talk to our family anymore. My uncle said that they just weren't happy with each other anymore, but sometimes I think it's because she learned that her husband and his sister were fucking. "

I watched this stand off for at least 15 minutes before the action was outside my line of sight. Of course I ran down to the street like the rubberneckers I am.

I've put this on a similar thread, but one time with their Customer Service made me a lifer.

One day I'm in my garage working on something with the Leatherman and snap the smallest flathead on it. I'm a bit devastated having it that long, but I contact Leatherman Customer Service and they tell me to ship it back for repair. Elated I send it back and then about 2 weeks later I get a package in the mail from them. There's a brand new Leatherman in the package, my old Leatherman, and a note. The note (paraphrased) stated they were unable to repair my broken Leatherman, so I should accept the new one as a replacement. However, they shipped back the old one in case it had sentimental value (it did). That small touch right there how a company knows what type of people buy their products touched me and I will forever be a customer of their's. "

"DM got butthurt over our party's inventive ways of solving problems. We had to be because he was always running on hardmode. Edit: And I loved it, just trying to add some drama here!

He retaliates by sending us into a situation of certain death.

Our Paladin dies, he's our tank and we're fighting an entire army division led by a demon-possessed general who gains power by causing death as a blood ritual. 

Another party member falls.

We are fighting in a small town, the streets and chokepoints with alleys/buildings and whatnot are the only things protecting us from the sheer number of enemies we were being pursued by.

Our Wizard is killed and our Dragonkin and Cleric (me, Race: Deva) are now fucked and DM is throwing us no bone - this was our punishment for thwarting his plans and creating solutions so inventive he could have never anticipate them - so his premade situations often had to be changed on the fly. (and he expertly did so as a DM)

How dare we. (!)

DM had designed the town and made a cool grid drawing. Houses, shops, town hall, farmhouses.... and on the edge of town...

A 20 ish story grain silo.

The Cleric dies and the lone survivor, our Dragonkin, gets close enough to the silo but... is wounded and near death.

Dragonkin last survivor asks DM if there is grain in the silo. The army and their Demon leader are closing in and ready to tear every scale from the dragonkin.

DM rolls, ""yes there is grain in the silo"".

Dragonkin nods to us and we smile with understanding... Dragonkin (our lone survivor) uses his turn to make fire with a special ability, aaaand...

DM didn't know about dust explosions being a very common hazard in grain silos and grain elevators: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_explosion

Months-long campaign over with hours upon hours of non-play time invested as well.

Best campaign I have played is doneski, town is a crater, main antagonist is vaporized, antagonist's army is vaporized and all party member corpses are vaporized. 


TL;DR:

Challenging DM, inventive party challenges DM. DM signs our death warrant by making us fight an entire army in a town.

Our lone survivor turns the town into a crater by using the town's grain silo as a Dust Bomb and vaporizes all our corpses, vaporizes the army, vaporizes the main antagonist (a demon-possessed leader of the army that we couldn't even win against 4v1)

Best Campaign I played ever is concluded. We spent months on this.

"How much effort we have to put into dating. We're expected to make the first move, plan the first date (and probably subsequent dates), go in for the kiss, hold her hand, invite her over, etc. If we do it too soon, we risk coming off as a creep and ruining it. If we do it too late, we risk coming off as unconfident or uninterested, and we ruin it. Plus, the threshold for too soon/too late is different for every woman, and you don't have any way of knowing what it is until you go for it. Sure you could ask, but guess what, a lot of women are turned off by that too, and you have no way of knowing until you go for that either.

edit: i forgot to add that this happened before Greeces economy collapsed on itself and the prices for solar panels skyrocketed and the returns became miniscule.

"So I grew up on a farm on the Welsh/English border (so lots of hills). When I was 7 I went with my dad in the car up one of the fields because he was fixing the fence at the top of the hill. He left me in the car in the backseat whilst he went to work. In my boredom I decided to climb to the front of the car, in doing so I stepped on the handbrake and the car started to roll down the hill and pick up speed. 

So as this happened I pannicked and had no idea what to do, Im not a religious person but in that moment I just remember being calm and praying to be alright as the car headed for a whole load of trees at the end of the field. Then I looked to the right and saw my dad sprinting alongside working his way to the front of the car, he jumped in and slammed on the breaks and managed to control it to a stop. This was promptly followed by ""Don't tell Mum about this"". "

"I was the manager at an EB Games back in the day. This was probably about 2000-2001. I was there for the launch of the PS2 and Diablo 2 (two biggest events I can remember). 

We had an older lady come in one day and wanted to ""return"" a system she had bought for her son. She claimed he had gotten bad grades in school and was returning it as a punishment. She handed me this ridiculously old and beat up cardboard box. I opened it to find a dirty, dusty, cheeto fingerprint covered PS1. I knew that the original PlayStation launched in 1994 (...and now I feel super old), so what I was looking at in the box was at least 6 years old. I paused, looked back at her, and for whatever reason asked if she had the receipt. She actually did. Sure enough, it had the date printed on it, and it was from some time in '94. 

I still hadn't said anything more, I was just looking at the mess in front of me when she spoke up and said something along the lines of ""and I'll just take the cash back, that will be fine."" I laughed, which was probably my first mistake, and said ""I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be able to return this, this is six years old, and clearly used."" 

She tried to argue that she had bought it here at this store and the manager at the time told her she could return it for ""any"" reason and went on this crazy diatribe about her kid being bad, etc, etc. It went on for a good 5-10 minutes. When she was done, I just flipped the receipt over and read her the EB return policy. ""30 days from date of purchase for unopened merchandise... etc"". 

She completely lost it. It escalated so quickly I contemplated calling mall security (ha!) and the police. She wasn't having it. Then I told her she could ""sell"" the system back to us (it was worth about $40 at the time), which would have given her something, but she wasn't biting on that one. 

She asked for the manager, demanded to see the manager, wouldn't rest until she told the manager how rude I had been (I was pretty much a saint for most of this) and was going to get me fired. I just pointed to my name tag, and in the most satisfied tone humanly possible said ""Lady, I AM the manager, and there's no way on God's green earth that I'm returning an opened, 6 year old, clearly used, dirty PlayStation.""

"You *still* have acne.

I swear I was told a hundred times by adults, including my own doctor, that once you get older and your hormones calm down, you don't get acne.

Nope. You still get it. Sometimes it goes away, sometimes it comes back. Medication will set it off. Decided to go for a jog? Yup, acne on you back, bacne. 

Don't be fooled, it's not just teenagers who get acne. "

"My dad might was a mercenary or something in the 70's and 80's

Growing up he taught me all sorts of cool shit, how to live off the land, how to fight (with and without weapons), how to use and maintain a firearm, how to ""read"" people. He even taught me how to speak Russian and Spanish well enough. 

When he died in the mid 2000's, I was going through his shit and saw some pictures of him in camo. I always figured he was in the Army but never said anything. 

At the time I had a friend who was in and I asked if he could look up my dad and he said that there is no record of him being in the service. Then I asked my mom about his time in and she said he was never in the Army. He got caught up with some security gig and went off to South and Central America for a good while. We dont know, we probably never will know. "

"I decided I wanted a whip as one of my weapons. Early into our campaign we come across a house of hags. On the first floor we killed the first one, I then wrapped its neck with my whip and dragged it upstairs to show the sisters as a threat. 

Next, I used my torch and oil to blow fire and burn the second hag. On the third hag, we used a snake to bind her movements, then I rolled a critical with my whip, wrapping my whip around its neck (Indiana Jones style), and had a companion throw her out the window follow by a critical strength check to yank the whip and snap her neck on the way down. 

Apparently I was feeling especially aggressive that day. 

EDIT: Another time, in the same campaign, we came across a cult leader. We killed her and found out she had adult children. 

So I grabbed ole trust whip and dragged her from the hidden basement to the main room and decided to use a rope to make it look like she hung herself, leaving a note reading ""My dear boys, I fear I have wasted my life with wrong and unredeemable choices. My dying wish is that you learn from my wrong doings and turn your back to these evil ways. Please don't fall into the seductive and devouring pits of darkness.""

"In Washington D.C., it's any Trump or MAGA swag. I'm not judging anyone's politics, but I literally don't know anyone from DC that is pro-Trump. Even ironically. DC is traditionally highly Dem anyway, but add to it that everyone either works for the government or cares about someone who does, and there's just bad feelings everywhere. The tension and stress has been palpable since the election. Again, it's not politics so much as his administration has either intentionally or accidentally (through incompetence) neutered many government agencies by failing to appoint leadership or provide direction. And I know it's America's favorite meme to make fun of lazy government employees, but they are actually some of the hardest working and most impassioned people on the planet, and the existential dread that comes from being leaderless right now is horrible."

The host's autistic 3 year old son is walking around the edge of the pool, and occasionally crouching to put his hand in the water. I'm talking to someone, but I catch this out of the corner of my eye thinking he's going to roll into the pool. When he gets to the deep end, I see him slowly start to lose his balance and roll. I gently place my cigar and drink down in one smooth motion and I'm already sprinting across the deck as I hear the parents screaming for someone to get him. I dive in fully clothed, grab the boy and bring him to the side of the pool. Everyone was amazed I was in motion before they realized what was going on."

Here's the setting; the party are travelling through a village overlooked by a menacing manor house. They hear that the children of the town have been kidnapped by the vampire that dwells within the manor and turned.

The party knows that if they can kill the vampire before the next full moon, the children will become human again. So they venture into the manor to find and kill the vampire. As they explore the manor house, they find excerpts of the vampires journal detailing his descent into madness, and eventually vampirism. It tells of how the vampire lost his children to a wasting disease that has plagued the town before, and his wife killed herself shortly after. How he cursed the gods and was cursed in turn.

The party eventually find and kill the vampire lord, but to their shock, the children die shortly after turning back. It turns out that the disease that affected the vampires children hundreds of years ago was a genetic disease that emerges every so many years. He was kidnapping children with the disease and turning them, saving them from a painful death. Turning them back resulted in the children all succumbing rapidly to the disease.

The aftermath of the quest was that the party donated all the gold they found in the manor to the townsfolk, helped bury the children and planted the banner they'd looted a while back as a monument to the lives lost.

"I started out bussing tables eight years ago. Got really good with restaurant work and dealing with customers. Started taking tables after about a year when word got around that I could cook and I ended up in the kitchen and getting my food service license. 

Got an opportunity to manage a restaurant, worked 70 hour weeks on average, rarely saw my kids, and tried to drink myself to death in my (very limited) free time. Did that for three years. Then I took a job at a small cafe by my apartment. The pay wasn't enough and the hours were kind of shitty. But I had weekends off and could have my kids at work. 

I ended up meeting the owners of the hardware store across the street and we had very similar views on customer service and how a business should be run. They hired me a short time later and after about two months came across some rough times, which I was able to help them through. I moved up fast and am now in the process of becoming store manager after only a year and a half. 

So that's my simple eight year story. I tried to kill myself and that didn't work. I tried to drink myself to death and that didn't work. I tried to bury myself in work, women, drugs, anything that would shut up that voice inside my head. That didn't work either. 

I got an opportunity that I didn't realize I was preparing for and now I'm 9 months sober, still have my kids, a 401k, paid vacation. Dare I say a future? Soooo....decent."

"Currently a doctoral student doing my clinical training as a therapist. I had one client who adamantly believed that happiness is a choice, and lived by this belief. This client really changed my outlook on my own life, and I find myself stressing less about small stuff that doesn't matter in the long run. I also don't let the choices of others have as much of a negative impact on my own mood as they have in the past, which was a huge struggle of my own. This, of course, is not always going to be an option for everyone all the time, especially for those who suffer from clinical anxiety, depression, and the like. This was a high functioning client who had a fairly good handle on things so it worked well for them. It was really an excellent reminder that our clients aren't just there to learn from us and our guidance, but we learn so much from them as well. "

"Spent 2007-2012 homeless. Most of that was my teenage years spent with my father (also homeless).  The scariest thing is spending the evening in some homeless shelters, or out of them in this case. I was in one in Portland, Maine. My dad was assigned a ""spot"" to sleep on the floor because they were overcrowd that day. They didn't have a spot for me so I slept across the street in the garden of the local Catholic church since the priests don't kick people out. It was a popular place to sleep when the shelter was ""over booked"". I remember sleeping in the grass near a couple whom I overheard talking about robbing me for well over 20 minutes. I didn't let go of my knife all night. 

The most surreal moment was a short stint in 2010. When I walked into the 400 square foot studio apartment my dad had finally been able to afford for a short while and asking him,

""This is all ours?""

We lived like kings that few months."

"Alright, let's work through this.

What we know about Podrick:

+ keen
+ complete beginner
+ caring &amp; considerate
+ empathetic
+ determined
+ honest
+ wants to get better
+ fairly respectable
+ middle of the road handsome 
+ virgin
+ energetic as only young men can be
+ full of spunk

I think these are all fair assumptions based on his character from the series (the books I don't remember him being fleshed out quite like this).

The prostitutes will have been used to men using them and not really caring whether they came or not, almost certainly when they were in a multiple women to one man situation. Podrick is not, iirc, paying for them, I'm sure it's a reward from Tyrion. So immediately that kind of changes how someone would approach it. Instead of thinking ""I paid for this so I'm damned sure going to get my money's worth, and forget about the women"", he's probably thought ""Holyyyy Father, Warrior and Smith, this is going to be amazing, what an opportunity!"" This is a fairly respectable individual, being with prostitutes has probably only ever been a forlorn dream of his - even if he was a knight, I'm sure he'd be like Ned and keep faithful to his wife. So this may be a once in a lifetime opportunity.

My bet is, being a virgin, he is overcome with how beautiful the female form is (weren't we all), and will have paid attention to their bodies unlike most that these women entertain. He wants to learn, improve and get better at things, so he was probably pretty honest about being a virgin and would have been asking questions about the female functions, and happy to learn how to ensure they were getting some pleasure. And I mean, can you imagine, they would have made him cum, then on the down time he would be like a bluefly getting in about all of those penis fly traps, examining them close up and figuring out just how they work. He's going to use this opportunity to learn *exactly* how to please women, and I'm betting he gave most of them orgasms. This would have been aided by his energy and vigour, so he probably had shit loads of stamina for lots and lots of mattress dancing.

Other possibilities:

+ He has a large cervix crusader: **possibly, but I'm sure these women will have seen many a veinous maximus, so they wouldn't be as delighted about it as they were shown to be. Remember the fucking Mountain is kicking about, and let's be real he must have a woody womb pecker that the Titan of Braavos would be jealous of.**

+ He found all their G-spots: **unlikely, as this is hard even for veterans of the bearded clam of pleasure. Not only that, but it would seem a bridge too far for a first timer, does he really need to have found that elusive sweet spot, nah he could just have made them all orgasm.**

+ He was actually gay and they didn't have sex at all, and the women were relieved to have a break: **possible, but pretty doubtful, his sexuality isn't hinted at being anything other than straight.**"
"Hurricane Hugo in Charleston S.C.

 It was insane. I watched a waffle house sign breath in and out and then explode. The wind bent the steel I-beam holding the sign in half. The street lights started spinning on the wire and broke off and flew away.

The wind blew the roof off of the hotel I was staying in. We were evacuated to the first floor before the eye passed. I went out for ice (stupid) and saw the eye. It was a circle of clouds and lightning but the center was completely clear.  I could see every star in the sky directly above me. The backside of the storm hit after that and that is a whole other story. "

"My appendix burst really badly and I the doctors didn't realise it had burst and thought it was appendicitis and so it wasn't an emergency, the appendectomy was delayed till the following day (an extra 10 hours). During this time the infection spread a lot and I had developed sepsis (blood poisoning), when the cut me open they realised it was really bad and the operation took about 3 hours (standard appendectomy is about 1). Afterwards I was in hospital for a week and I lost 2 stone and there were lots of mixups with painkiller dosage. It was painful and horrible and had my operation been delayed by another 5 hours I would've been seriously fucked."
"I work with a lot of different body shops, and in my area the big thing to do is to enhance the damage to customers cars. I don't mean they try and negotiate harder, I mean they actively create more damage to previously undamaged panels, usually in ways that don't affect the function and are hidden to the customer, in order to get the insurance company to pay them more money. In my area, while not every shop does this, I would say the honest ones are the minority. 

And it screws the customer over in the long run. The shop might promise that they will ""save you your deductible"", but in the end you end up with a car that has unrepaired damage or you have to pay out of pocket if the insurance company catches the shop enhancing. And the sad thing is there is almost no way to know which shops do this  when you pick a shop."
"Bisexual here. In same-gender relationships:

1. Sharing clothing is a given, probably some makeup too if you both wear it.
2. Emotional expectations and boundaries can be easier to articulate, as you may be coming at it from more similar perspectives.
3. You get clear on whether or not you're comfortable with PDA real quick, because otherwise you risk outing yourselves.
4. Best of all: you never have to try and dance around gender expectations or explain that you really aren't good at cooking despite being raised as a woman. You get to set your own boundaries for the relationship entirely, with very little societal pressure.

In different-gender relationships:

1. It can be easier to divide labor in a household, since there are expectations for both parties roles already.
2. You never have to worry about minor PDA or explain to your partner that you're not out to everyone so you can't hold hands.
3. Clothing sharing sometimes works, but it sadly usually only goes one direction. Works out great for the smaller partner, though.

I've found that honestly, I find very few differences between same-gender and different-gender long term relationships. What's actually different is *dating.* They're night and day different, and not because of gender but more because of what people are looking for and expect out of a date.

"It's a bit of both. If consumer behavior analysts found out that it's better for business to have milk in the checkout lane, they probably wouldn't redesign the stores just for that. 

Having refrigerated items like that in the back makes economic sense. In many stores, it allows them to share the freezer/refrigerator with the storage area. It also allows for restocking from behind. 

So you were partially right here. That is something that works out both for consumer behavior reasons and store efficiency reasons. "

There is a federal law that handles retirement benefits to former spouses.  Usually, if the marriage lasted 10 years, which overlapped 10 years of federal service, the former spouse is *entitled* to 50%.  Some states have separate laws regarding military pensions.  


Source: army, divorced in Washington state.  My ex and I were married for 7 years (1 year separated). She would have received some portion of my potential retirement had she pressed for it.

I told her that I would separate from the Army with no retirement if she pushed for it. Realistically, I'd also take a pay cut, which would decrease child support.  She ultimately dropped her claim to my benefits."

"Not someone I was dating, but a colleague of mine was dating this guy...

It was a group of recent graduates working as software developers, and we were all just hanging out, having some drinks, and someone had bought a copy of Cards against Humanity.

We start playing, and he's asking her about a few of the cards - not unusual - there are some American references that people here tend not to get.

He becomes czar, and it becomes painfully clear that he is just flat out struggling to read the words on the cards. Not the more esoteric stuff either, just a lot of the standard words. Young child level reading.

Most of the things in this thread are amusing, but this moment was heartbreaking. Everyone in that room took reading completely for granted - we are talking about a group of software developers with degrees.

Fortunately people were tactful about it and while he was obviously initially self-conscious for that round, it's a free-form enough game people pushed it into a form that included him more - people laughed longer at things when he was trying to read something to give him time, or defined more unusual terms casually as they praised the joke or whatever (""that's good - I like the wordplay with X and Y""). He seemed to take part and enjoy it, and I don't think people came away as patronising.

I feel bad putting it in the post because ""idiot"" has such negative connotations, and the guy wasn't necessarily stupid, but rather clearly not educated. I just thought it makes for an interesting counter to all of the ""dicks who are stupid"" examples. This guy was genuinely nice, and it's horrific to me that anyone can reach twenty years old with such poor literacy in the UK. I can't imagine my life - reading is such a huge part of it in so many ways.

Edit: Wow, this blew up. Thanks for all the kind words. I'll clarify that he wasn't a graduate, he was just dating one of the graduates. He also wasn't dyslexic - I had similar thoughts initially - I got the story from the graduate he was dating after the event - she explained that it was to do with problems growing up meaning he just never gained basic literacy. She was trying to persuade him to try an adult learning course at the time, but they split up for unrelated reasons and I only knew him through her, so I'm afraid I can't give any updates.

"My absolute best friend in the world has such a unique way of talking to his mom. When I first met him he seemed pretty normal til one day I heard him on the phone with his mom, and it went something like this: *""No I don't give a fucking shit what you do mom. No I fucking told your dumb ass that I would call you afterwards. No. No. List-list-listen- MOM SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LISTEN. Yeah, I'll call you later after I get home. Okay, love you, bye.""* I was absolutely appalled by this. That is, until I met his mother, and I realized that that was just they way they both talk to each other - abusively. But holy shit, I've never seen a mom and son more blindly loyal and loving towards each other. "
"Took my car for an oil change/tire rotation and they recommended some services that were ""immediately necessary based on the condition of the vehicle"" and said I should've had it all done at 10K miles and that now the tires are worn and there's build-up somewhere in the engine or whatever (I'm no mechanic). 

I said no, my car only has 7K miles on it, and there's absolutely no way it has all those issues. In fact, I was having it serviced at the dealership **where I bought it** only like 1 year prior."

"Had a ranch hand I caught for animal abuse. I get a high school kid to work at my place every so often for those needed graduation community service hours. 

He needed like a whole day worth of hours for graduation and it was a week before. His mom dropped him off in the morning, luckily I had enough shit to do that I could keep him busy for 10 hours on a Saturday. Got there at 6 am, obviously didn't want to be there, got him to help me castrate males (meaning he just held em down while I did the stuff you need a skilled hand for).

I give him the task of sorting ewes while I go fix a gate on the other side of the barn. Simple enough, Red chalk on the back goes out in the big pasture, yellow  chalk goes in the little pasture with one ram, blue chalk goes in the pen with another ram. Simple enough, Just catch and sort. I had one ewe I called 'felicia' cause she was a BITCH. She'd run from you and all you could say is 'bye felicia'. And once you caught her she'd fight you tooth and claw to get away. IDK why she was this way, she just was.

Anyway. I guess he had trouble getting her to move and so he reared back and punched this sheep across the nose hard enough to knock out a tooth. Which trust me, takes A LOT. I've seen one run face first, full speed into a wooden barn and not lose any teeth and he knocked one out in one punch. 

I was pissed. Pulled him inside, called his mom, sent him home, refused to sign off on his hours cause I had to spend time to make sure she didn't get hurt worse than we thought.

I should note, Felicia died a year later, but just of old age. But she did eventually calm down and that one missing tooth didn't get in her way too much."

Took him back to hospital and they still couldn't find anything wrong with him. Put him on a drip for a couple of days, monitored him. Still couldn't find anything wrong. Sent him home again. He's been fine ever since. I suppose he was just dehydrated. Still, he got revenge for them sending him home: projectile pooped the entire length of the hospital room all over the door, right up to the ceiling. Still don't understand how such a tiny thing could produce so much crap.  "

Do you have any idea how many people would tell me to try this or that, I've gotten people offering all sorts of 'health fad' foods, if you take this it will help, if you swallow this supplement it'll cure you... I got into an argument with a friend who kept telling me I need to eat more healthy and I need to stop relying on doctors and dietitian's because they are all a big money scam or some bullshit.

"I was an intern, he was my boss. Chemistry was off the charts. 

When he first interviewed me the sexual tension was intense. Nothing inappropriate happened, but I gushed to my friends later that if I got the job I was going to be in trouble because I had a huge crush on the guy.

After several weeks of interning, a few of us from work went out for drinks near the office. He lived close by with his roommate who also worked with us. They invited me to go to their place to smoke a joint around their back patio. Joint was smoked, and I think I asked him to show me something outside in the front, so we went through and as soon as we were alone just started furiously making out. I slept with him that night and stayed over. It had been a Friday night so at least we didn't have to go to work together the next day.

I go home in the morning, and it's not too awkward. He calls me the following Sunday to tell me that he likes me but it can't happen again because he's my boss. I understand where he's coming from so I'm not upset But then, the inappropriate texts start. The whole temptation of it being wrong makes it 10x hotter, so I went back over later again that week. That started what was a really hot and torrid secret summer affair. We actually dated for two more years after that (but not in secret once my internship ended and I was back in school) and are still friends.

It's actually surreal thinking back to that time that he was my ""superior"" given everything we've been through since, but I wouldn't take any of it back. It was one of the most fun summers of my life and I fell in love. "

Our sister flight's drill instructor was there, (a 6 foot tall black man) and our drill instructor was there, (a five foot tall black woman). 

There was this airman from Georgia. He asked if he could say something. He gave a small speech about how he used to be racist, and that his time in basic proved to him how he was wrong and that he wanted to apologize. It was one of the coolest things I've seen, and I'm never going to forget it. I thought at the time that it was super brave of him to say all of that on front of two black drill instructors. "

Turns out he dislocated his shoulder from jerking too hard (he dislocated them pretty easily, as he was overly flexible). So, I ended up having to drive him to the ER after getting his clothes on him. We told everyone he slipped when trying to get out of bed... I don't think even his mom bought that story, haha."

"Know the difference between a gigabit and a gigabyte. One gigabit/megabit/kilobit is only equal to 0.125 gigabyte/megabyte/kilobytes.  A lot of services (like Verizon) advertise their data caps and data speeds in gigabits so as to confuse customers who don't know the difference. If your plan has a 8 gigabit data cap, then you can only really use 1 gigabyte of data. Likewise, your 100mbit/s internet speed only has a peak download of 12.5 megabytes per second. "

"I'm still angry about it. 

I was walking across my university campus with my best friend, on our way back from having dinner nearby. We notice a ring of students standing around a shape on the ground, gawking open-mouthed, and none of them seemed to be saying anything. That can't be good. We both stop, look at each other, and turn around to go see what those idiots are staring at. 

It's a child. A girl, maybe 14 years old, unconscious on the sidewalk. Obviously of First Nations descent. She was wearing a thin shirt in November in Edmonton, Canada, which means that sidewalk would have been about the same temperature as the bottom of your freezer. I ask the nearest student what was going on. She looks at me and tells me that this girl is unconscious, and that none of them can wake her up. Have they tried calling out to her? Nope. Have they tried touching her? Nope. Have they checked if she's even fucking breathing? Of course not. I'm still trying to come to terms with the fact that I go to a school filled with morons when the girl informs me that she's trying to find the phone number for campus security on her phone (roughly as helpful as flagging down a children's birthday party clown for help), but it's too cold to work the touchscreen on her phone. We ask how long the girl has been on the ground, and they respond that they've been standing here discussing what to do for twenty. goddamn. minutes. 

She's been there for twenty minutes. On the ground. In weather too cold to operate a fucking smartphone. And to top it all off, WE ARE ON A CAMPUS THAT HAS A TEACHING HOSPITAL. I CAN SEE IT FROM WHERE WE'RE STANDING. 

I whip out my phone and dialled 911 immediately, and one of the students nearby tells me that you ""can't call 911 for drunk Indians, it's not an emergency"". If I hadn't been on the phone with a 911 operator being talked through first aid, I would have throat-punched him. Paramedics showed up in under two minutes (Because again. I can SEE the hospital.) and brought the kid around with smelling salts. They took her off to check her out for hypothermia, overdose and a possible head injury from falling down on goddamn concrete. No idea how it turned out for her. But holy shit, I'm still angry on her behalf. "

I started to make my way back to the entrance to take cover in my car when I saw two giant figures off the trail in the woods just standing there. After looking a little closer I realized it looked like two older ladies standing in the forest motionless with this  expressionless drained sense of dread on their face just starring at each other while it poured. The really creepy thing was these people were huge I'm talking like 6'5 or more. I noped the fuck out of there and now only hike in groups. "

Still kept going and the sense was getting more and more intense until I finally stopped and stared one big half dead tree in front of me and couldn't get my eyes off it. I felt hypnotized, like I was in awe with surroundings. When I could finally move I ran away back to the place. I haven't seen anything but I remember the weird feeling and silence. It's wasn't a sense of dread, but I felt like I wasn't welcome and I needed to leave as soon as possible. "

"Just a warning, sorry about the grammar and all that since I'm typing from mobile. Also not my story but a family friend. 

So my ""uncle"" not really related but a long time friend of my dad was kidnapped in mexico city. We call his type of kidnapping an ""express kidnapping"" because they will just drive around town looking for random people to kidnap for either ransom or organ extraction. Well he got kidnapped on a Tuesday I believe, they held him in a room for about 3 days or so. Unlucky for him he was kidnapped to take his organs, all of them. Well they had a doctor there that would do a full check up on him to make sure he was healthy. Well lucky for him, the doctor told them that he had cancer everywhere and he was unusable. He told them he was going to die probably in couple months anyways so there was no reason to kill him. They took him out of the city into the highway in between Mexico city and Mexico state. They literally threw him in a ditch and left him there. They told him if they ever see him again they were gonna kill him. Well he managed to find a ride home and returned home to his family. 

Here's the crazy part, he heard the doctor talk about his cancer and what not, so he went to the hospital once he was back and enough time had passed so he felt safe going outside. Well at the hospital he got a full check up, and to his surprise he was completely healthy, no sign of cancer or anything. 

To this day we don't know if the doctor felt pitty for him or there was a mistake on the test but he got really lucky and he survived imminent death. We haven't seen him in a while tho, because after all this he decided to move cities and stay off the radar because of the fear of the kidnapped finding out about him. He comes to town once in 5 years or so but even then he only stays for a couple of days. "

An example of a song that would actually be felt in 11 would be [This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdxrERxQo8) from Mario Kart 64, or [Eleven Four, by Paul Desmond / Dave Brubeck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60WB6Aepxmc).

"I'm right with you there. I'm throwing a birthday party and invited a few colleagues. I don't think any of them will show up. They had a cake last month for 2 other girls who had birthdays. I put money on it I don't get a cake. I'm a little socially awkward. Like, at work I can hold a conversation just fine, but when it comes to something outside of work I usually have some excuse that I can't go. Gotta let the dogs out, plans with the fam/inlaws, etc. So I'm not surprised if they don't show up to my event. But it still sucks. The ""she's nice, but has no friends"" thing really hit home for me. 

Edit: Holy crap this blew up! Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes and sharing your stories with me. I really appreciate it.

The birthday party isn't until Saturday. I'll try to remember to let you all know how it goes. I have other people invited than coworkers (family, one or 2 close friends, and some of my SO'S buddies), so I know it won't be a total bust, don't worry about that.

For anyone who's offered to buy me a cake, or send me a card, or anything like that, thank you! If you'd really like to do something, my dog Spud's birthday is the 7th, make a donation from Spud's mom or something to www.catawbahumane.org (donation information is on the bottom left of the page I think they even have an amazon wishlist). It'll go to better use! 

To those who say ""Well, if you don't go to their stuff why should they go to yours?"" I get that. And I said that already. In the year I've worked there there have only been about 2 things I've actually been invited to. And I'm trying to get better, however it's always been hard for me to put myself out there. So thanks for the push, hopefully I'll do better in the future!  

Edit #2: Well, everything went pretty much as expected, no cake from work. I spent yestersay morning frantically trying to get everything together, come 2pm, when the party was supposed to begin, no one from work showed up. Oh! Nor did my half sister, or my SO's family that said they would be there. So. It was my parents, and my little brother, and me and my boyfriend for the majority of the day. One of my friends did come for a few hours, and she brought me cupcakes! That was awesome. Then the SO's poker buddies started rolling in around 7, 8. It'll be ok. I had fun."

"I once made all the way home from downtown Toronto to Etobicoke without seeing a single human being.  

A long time ago I had a job working for the Ministry of Natural Resources which was at Queen's Park Toronto.  Queen's Park is where our provincial parliament is located.  My job was IT working on an ancient computer that ran Fortran on punch cards, despite it being the late 80's.  I had a shift that went from 3:30 pm to 11:30.  Of course there's not a lot of people around near the end of your shift.  It's a big creepy 19th century building.  From, six pm to the end of my shift I didn't see a single person, not even a janitor or security guard, which is not unusual.  Which was always a bit creepy to me, it bugged me.

At the end of my shift I had to hurry to catch the subway because in Toronto they used to shut down just before midnight on a weekday.  There are a tunnels underneath Queens Park that connect it to other buildings and the subway.  I took one tunnel, completely devoid of people to an automated entrance.  So I saw no one on the subway including the guy in the booth.  As soon as I got down to the bottom of the stair the train was already there and I just barely made what was likely the very last train.  
So I never got a look at the driver, and the train was completely empty.  

I never saw another person the whole trip home, including the parts of the trip where the train goes above ground.  No pedestrians, no traffic in the streets, nothing.  I made it all the way to Islington and I'm kinda freaking out because I'm having a 'Last man on Earth' kind of feel.  When I got up the stairs from the platform I already missed all the last buses and the entrance booth was closed, there was no one in the station.  

When I'm walking home from the subway I don't see a single car on the streets, and there's never any pedestrians this time of night.  I could have literally stripped off all my clothes, hopped onto the subway illegally, and streaked all the way home and no one would have known.

"A few months after buying my home, I received a snotty letter from the property manager stating that I hadn't been paying my fees and that they were going to take legal action.  I checked my bank statement, and the cheques had cleared.

I wrote back to the property manager, told him that the tone of his letter was extreme for a first letter for a minor issue and not appreciated.  I also included duplicate copies of the cheques and stated that I had verified with my bank that they had all cleared.  I also copied the 8 board members (and included the snotty letter from the property manager).

The next evening, the board president stopped by and apologized.   The board agreed that the property manager's letter was inappropriate and that they would speak with him.  Two weeks later, a notice was posted in the community building that the property management company had been dismissed and that the board had selected a new one.

Apart from that, nothing much exciting.  They didn't like how I had run an antenna cable up the back of the house (admittedly it was a bit sloppy), so they sent the maintenance guy over to offer me guidance on their standards and he helped me clean it up."

"Maybe not the creepiest but the first to pop to my head. I remember seeing a girl drowning in a pool when I was about 11. 

I remember how bizarre the whole thing was because how weird it seemed to kid me at the time. 

Everyone was told to get out of the pool so that the staff can convert the pool into lanes for adults and other swimmers. The lifeguard must have been overseeing the staff because I didn't remember seeing one.

So I was just looking around the pool while they were doing this. In front of my feet as I skirted the edge of the pool, I saw this girl just suspended in the water. She looked like she was treading but underwater and her hair was all over the place. The weird thing was that she wasn't going anywhere. 

It looked controlled and peaceful but something about it was just off. So I pointed her out to someone because she wasn't supposed to be in there. 

An adult rushed over and pulled her out. In my mind she went from peacefully swimming underwater to hysterically crying when she got pulled out of there so it was pretty jarring imagery. 

Like she took this big shuddering breath and then started crying. It didn't really hit me that she was dying until I walked away from there 20 seconds later. Not the most creepy thing I witnessed but it seemed so bizarre and haunting to younger me. "

One of the guys was the kid who sat next to me. The way he put it was that she had a knob in each hand and was knelt down between the seated boys and throwing her head back to get the hair out of her face at the moment her father turned on the auditorium lights and that he was no more than 10 feet from them.

"More than half of all women struggle with some degree of incontinence at some point in their lives, usually after their fourth decade of life. Although most of these cases are relatively mild (urinary stress incontinence, for example, leaking when laughing, coughing, or doing strenuous exercise), some will experience much more severe problems, and even though most cases of incontinence can be improved or cured through medical treatment, many women feel too embarrassed to talk about the issue and feel very alone in their struggles.

"My cousin grew up rich (I grew up poor to lower middle class) and good god is he a little shit.

For Christmas I would ask for something, and if I didn't get it I knew it was probably because my parents couldn't afford it and I'd just try to enjoy what I did get. I've seen my cousin throw a fit because what he asked for wasn't in the first few gifts he opened. He also once threw a fit because he didn't get enough presents, and told his uncles he was going to close his eyes, and when he opened them he wanted more presents. His family just laughed. If I had done that every gift I got would have gone back to the store.

He took it for granted that when they went to the store he'd get a toy. I knew not to even ask for a toy unless we were in the Dollar Store.

He would constantly tell us our house and cars were shittier than the house and cars his parents had. He asked why my parents couldn't just get good jobs and buy better stuff. 

On a family vacation, he and his older brother asked to fly to their summer home in Virginia because they didn't want to go on the long car ride. So their parents bought them plane tickets.

On one occasion he wasn't being shitty, just genuinely confused. It was a really hot day during the summer and he was at our house. He asked why we didn't have the AC on and we explained running the AC was expensive, so we only turned it on when it got into the upper 90s. He couldn't understand why we didn't just pay the bill."

"It's interesting how what is in for women's body types has changed over my lifetime.  I graduated from high school in 1996.  We went from the ideal body type being skinny girls with big boobs in heavy metal videos when I was young to waif skinny when I started high school.  I went the first year and a half of high school to an all white school. (I'm also white.)  I was lean/muscular from running track, but with thicker thighs and a big, round booty.  Sir Mix-A-Lot had rapped about big butts, but to white kids in suburbia that was a joke song.  The boys at my schools thought my big butt was gross.  

Then, I went to a more diverse school and my stock went through the roof.  I soon realized Sir Mix-A-Lot wasn't the only black man who liked big butts. 

Then, along came J-Lo and the trend has continued on since then and now butts are starting to look freakishly big and fake.

"I have a few NSFW stories from being a former uber/lyft driver. 

My first took place last summer in Grand Rapids. I was doing my usual weekend rush and got a request out on the east side of the city. I arrive at the house and two middle aged, maybe 35-45 year old women come out of the house obviously intoxicated. They were being dropped off about 40 minutes outside the city on a surge, so I was pumped. We go through the normal driver rider chat then the two start talking amoungst themselves. They are talking about their kids' soccer game in the morning, a cook out that they are going to have, and how much fun they had that night. Then all of a sudden, it starts to get quiet in the back seat. The next thing I have is one whisper to the other ""I love you so much"" and then can hear a full on make out session going on in the back. I try as hard as I can to act like nothing is happening. That may have been a bad idea because thing in the back only escalated from there. We stop at a stop light and I hear one of the seatbelts unbuckle. I check the rear view mirror to see one of the mom's fully on top of the other. I suggest that the mom should put her seatbelt back on, but she obviously was too busy to listen to that. They continue to go at it the entire way home. The noises and moans from the back were almost unbearable. I get the the first house of one of the mom, and they continue going at it as if nothing happened. I politely say tell the woman that we have arrived, but she disregards it. I turn the lights on in the car. This was a big mistake. One mom's panties are on the ground, and the other's hands are where you would imagine. She goes ""oh my god we got home so quick,"" put her panties back on and gets out of the car. I get the address where I'm taking the other. She immediately passed out, and I had to shake her awake when I got to her destination. After she got out, I had to pullover and laugh at what had just taken place in my car. 

The second took place during pride weekend in GR. I got a request from the popular gay bar in the city which had been super busy as you would imagine. I pull up and a 6' 2"" large male in a wedding dress walks up, and he sits down in the front seat. Once again, we go through the normal chat at the start of the ride, and then he asks me, ""Can you help me out?"" Being a good driver and assuming he wants to stop somewhere before I get him to his destination, I say, ""Sure I can help you out."" He then goes in a complete different direction than I was expecting. He tells me that this was the first time that he had ever dressed drag and how much he liked feeling beautiful and womanly. I tell him that's awesome and ask him how he had managed to make his tits look womanly. He laughs and continues on saying that he had always been a top and he was thinking about being a bottom. I was not sure what he had meant by that though it may seemed obvious. He goes I've always pitched I want to catch. I tell him I understand what he is saying now. He goes now here is where I need your help. He goes on to say he want to buy a butt plug/dildo to help get him ready and needs an unbiased opinion. I laughed but was in too deep to not help him at this point. He goes through a cornucopia of options of shapes, sizes, and colors of different dildos. I am doing all I can to keep straightface while also trying to help. He lands on a six inch black fist and I tell him that is the obvious answer. He laughs and goes ""Then it is settled. I will buy it now."" He pulls out his card buys the dildo. We chat a little more and then I get to the destination. I drop him off, he tips me $5, then gives me a 5 star rating. Best part, the 5 star comment said "" he really knows how to help a man in need."" Once again, I had to pull over and laugh."

"3 course meals as regular meals (during the week, without extended family)

I was shocked when we went for a sleepover at our friends house, and it was like a 7 ingredients salad to begin with, along with a handmade vinaigrette, roast beef with rice and veggies, and a freaking homemade Nutella cake for dessert.

At first I was like ""that's because we're coming over, they made an effort"", but it wasn't. The kid didn't even seem fazed by it, and it turned out the dad was making a shit ton of money, the mom stayed at home, and every meal they had was at least 1 hour long or more. Not even mentioning the 6-7 hours long meals on Sundays with the extended family. 40 minutes was probably the longest meals we had in my family, for rare occasions with friends/cousins, etc..."

"about 10 years ago, when I was 17/18 I pulled into my driveway at about 2 am after being at a party. as I pulled in, I saw a MASSIVE brown animal in our driveway. I started freaking out, thinking it was a bear. I live on the outskirts of Birmingham, AL so idk how realistic a bear really was, but I digress. 

I started calling my dad from my cellphone, as he was inside dead asleep. he answers and I'm crying saying there's a bear in the driveway and I can't get out of my car. he instantly starts asking if I'm drunk or high and I swear I'm not but he doesn't believe me. after a few more minutes of me frantically crying and begging him to come outside, he finally agrees. 

now, my dad just sleeps in his underwear. tighty whities to be exact. so he comes busting out the front door in his whitey tighties and an open robe, with his loaded shotgun in hand. 

turns out it wasn't a bear, but a GIANT dead boar. apparently someone had killed boars and were dumping them in random yards around the city. I have no idea why. we didn't know what to do so we called the cops, and they came out, and requested I take a picture of them with it. 

[it was an old flip phone, so forgive the quality](https://imgur.com/gallery/Mu2Hn) but hey, at least I have pictures of it. wish I had a picture of my dad looking like a stereotypical Alabamian, but I didn't snap a pic of him 😔"
"The gay ""community"" is anything but inclusive. It is one of the most toxic, racist, catty, judgmental communities out there. And this is coming from a white gay guy. 

I don't even hang out with gay men anymore, even though I'm one myself. Rampant drug use, alcoholism, a complete lack of any impulse control, and tons of empty, carnal sex devoid of love, compassion or any meaningful connection. I've met so many gay men who are so dependent on drugs they don't even know how to enjoy sex unless they're on meth. 

You're just a slab of meat judged by your external attributes, and once you are no longer young and hot you are discarded and forgotten about. And don't even think about finding love and inclusiveness if you're Asian, black, fat, feminine or anyone that doesn't look like an Abercrombie model. 

It's really too bad. Instead of being united in the face of bigotry and homophobia, we're just a bunch of catty harpies who hate one another and treat our fellow gay men like discardable trash. I hate it, and I sometimes regret coming out.

"My friends and I had just moved into this house where the previous owner left a tonne of shit in the basement. Among enough rations to last an apocalypse for a month, there were at least 100 empty alcohol bottles. I'm not talking about beer bottles, try 1.5s of Jameson and Grey Goose. 

My friends and I just wanted to break the bottles, but we wanted to do it in the ""most destructive way possible."" We thought baseball bats. We thought about throwing them on the ground. That didn't satisfy our hunger for destruction. 

We decide to go to the richest neighborhood in my city at about 3 in the morning. We start throwing the bottles at car windows. We start throwing bottles through car windows. We are talking 80k+ cars. Family cars. Minivans. Trucks. Sports cars. Whatever we could find.

It didn't stop there. I carry baseball bats in my car for protection. We got bats out and just started smashing windows. 

We all just got so hyper and just let the hype take control. We must have caused over $100k worth of damage that night. We weren't drunk. We weren't high. We weren't intoxicated to any degree, just hyper as hell.

I deeply, deeply regret doing it. I was the driver, so I didn't cause as much destruction as the rest but I did facilitate it. "

For better or worse, as a gender, we are more aware of the possibility of an assault taking place, overall. "

Yeowch, I hope you're in a better place now. I know some of the homeless around GR hung out at the Meijer I worked at and just laid low for the night. Night management usually had a heart and wouldn't say anything unless they got customer complaints. I never said a word when they'd come by the spray deodorants in my dept. to try and hide their smell the following morning. Shit's rough."
Disney world in the summer with kids. 
"&gt; The line for that ride was over 2 hours each time

That's a complete disaster; it would have to be a bloody great ride to be worth waiting 2 hours for even once. If it's getting to that point, they probably want to operate a ticket system.

(Mind you, if this was Disneyland, they'd probably use that convenience as an excuse to screw you out of even more money)."

"One night many years ago, I was in the bottom bunk (little brother on top bunk...he was about 9 at the time and I was 16ish) playing with my cell...it was already pretty late and could hear my little brother playing with toys in the closet and giggling. 

I thought he wanted to scare me since the room/closet had no lights on and I would generally charge my phone by the outlet next to the closet. He would always try to get me back for scaring him. 

After a couple of minutes I got up and turned on the closet light and in the middles of saying ""dude go to sleep"" I realize that there's no one in the closet...in shock I'm staring blankly into the closet...Then turn and look at the top bunk and I see my brother laying down sleeping. 

I could not understand wtf was going on, ran to my parents room and they told me I was an idiot just to go back to bed. I couldn't sleep that night. I was just waiting for the giggling and shuffling in the closet. Creepiest thing ...several things happened to me in our previous house.

"When I was a little younger I spent nearly all of my time out in the woods by myself, slowly charting the acreage behind my family's house that was isolated by miles of back roads. One day around midday in September or October I decided to take a long hike into the area we didn't own. We had a black lab, Sandy, who I had brought with me for safety, and we walked to a creek that we followed some way back into the woods. After some distance, far enough that I no longer recognized my surroundings, the creek spilled into a small reservoir the size of a backyard pool. I remember clearly that it was the time of year where the leaves had started to change color; I remember the pool was black with silt and decorated by a few downed trees. 

Once I had stepped around the very edge of the pool there was a shift. Like if you messed with the contrast or saturation too much in a photo editor. I remember the color, temperature, light, sound, and even objects appeared different to me. As it is an older memory there are a number of details that I can't be sure whether I actually remember or have since fabricated in some way, yet I have infallible confidence in two details. The water had become completely clear and there was notably lush vegetation densely packed around the edge of the pool. I froze for what felt like a number of seconds before I felt something pulling me, my dog tugging on the leash. As I turned my head everything snapped back to normal, however, my surroundings were now dark and it was evidently around sunset. Confused to this day, I've confirmed with family that I left the house after lunch and based on the ground I had covered there was no way I had been in the woods for longer than an hour or two. Sandy was pulling me towards home, towards voices calling; apparently I had been in the woods for eight hours. 

We have since moved but to satisfy my nostalgia I actually returned for a visit. The owners were gracious enough to let me have a walk around and as a part of it, I ended up relocating that area by following that creek again. It was the dry season, but I found the area where it must have been and I confirmed that there is no way I could have been in the woods that long. I'm a rational person and I tend to believe things I can see and explain, but this has always eluded me."
"Obligatory not a divorce lawyer, but here you go.

My parents got divorced about 9 years ago, I was 9. After the economy got fucky, my dad, who owned his own business, could no longer afford my mom's extravagant shopping bills. Instead of having a talk like a normal person, he decided to stop paying the mortgage. The house was foreclosed upon years later without my mother's knowledge. Her credit was destroyed because her name was on the lease. 

It was about this time that my dad removed all the money from their shared bank account, leaving $135. He said, ""That should be enough for the two of you for a couple months.""

My mom sold her wedding ring at a pawn shop so we could have Christmas and I wouldn't know anything was wrong. My parents got divorced, my dad took her to court for everything but in the end it ended up being a pretty fair divorce agreement. We were allowed to live in the house for two years before we had to leave.

My mom overstayed that by about a year, in an attempt to get me to finish middle school. That was when my dad broke into the house, stole stuff from us, changed the locks on the doors, and shut us out. We spent most of the night in the police station before they kicked my dad back out of the house and we walked in to find most of our things missing.

We went back to court and the judge told us we had until August 30th to move out (about a month). On the 20th, while I was sitting home alone (my mom was at work), my dad broke into the house and I hid under the bed as he ransacked the place. He found things that were rightfully ours, that we were planning to sell to afford a new place, and took them.

So, yeah. Not great."
"America houses *22 percent of the entire world's prison population*, even though the United States only represents roughly 4.4 percent of the world's population.

To put that in perspective, there are roughly 9 million prisoners in the world all together, and the United States houses around 1,980,000 of them. America is less ""land of the free"", and more ""land of the imprisoned"" when it comes to incarceration rates."

It was so bad that she had me help her make a video to tell them to stop being assholes to her and I, and had me post it on Facebook. They did absolutely nothing to help her while she was dying.

I RTO musical instruments to students and their parents. Yes, it's more expensive in the long run to RTO the instrument, but if the kid decides after a year that he doesn't want to play the viola any longer, the parent is only out ~$300 rather than the $900 the instrument costs."

"My local comic shop. Yeah, I could go online and order comics from some big warehouse, or get subscriptions from the publishers themselves, and it would save me some money. 

But every time I go in there, the employees always seem genuinely happy to be at work. They're also really good at giving recommendations—my fiancée just started getting into comics and they've been super helpful finding her some books she really loves—and they're also super great with kids.

This is an actual conversation I had across the checkout a few weeks ago:

&gt;""How are you doing today?""

&gt;""I'm doing pretty well. How about yourself?""

&gt;""Oh I can't complain.""

"The gympie-gympie is the second scariest tree in my personal opinion. The manchineel takes the cake on ""scary fucken trees"". 

Literally every part of the tree is toxic, some of the toxins we haven't even identified yet, they're brand-new to us and only found in the manchineel. It has little apples that look delicious and taste delicious, and slightly peppery. The peppery feeling very quickly proceeds to a severe burning sensation and anaphylactic shock, as your esophagus, trachea, and bronchial tubes all begin to swell shut. The sap blisters skin and can permanently blind you. It grows all over the Caribbean, in Florida, in Mexico, in Central America, and the northern parts of South America. Historically, the Carib Natives would use manchineel leaves to poison the water supplies of rival tribes. There are now signs and markings at most manchineel trees, indicating in various languages that you don't touch it, eat things from it, get near it, pick up the leaves that have fallen, nothing."

The cosmonauts knew that the spacecraft had major safety problems, but Komarov stated that if he were to refuse to fly, Gagarin would be forced to go instead. Komarov chose to fly to protect Gagarin, and insisted before the flight that his funeral be open-casket so that the Soviet leadership could see what they had done."

I had a friend when I was like 8/9 years old. We would sometimes go to his house and sing and dance around like kids do, and his mum was like SUPER supportive of him, telling him how good he was doing and how she liked his voice or whatever.

She'd say the same to me and I wouldn't know how to deal with it, thinking she was taking the piss or mocking me somehow. It was a really weird feeling when I understood that she was just trying to support this kid and the things they enjoyed.

She was a nice lady. Lost touch with them pretty soon after we became friends because I moved home (military brat) but I remember it."

I blinked at him confused as to why he was yelling at me and given I could see absolutely no reason why I couldn't go I just lifted my foot off the brake and slowly started crawling forward. I maintained eye contact with him the entire time while he was screaming at me to stop and waddling after my car.

"A driver I once had figured out a system where he would get me to book for the same trip on both Uber and a similar local competitor. He would then charge me for the cheaper of the two rides. Since the local competitor allowed cash payments, if it was cheaper, he's give me the difference in cash since Uber would automatically charge my card. If Uber was cheaper, he wouldn't charge me anything beyond the automatic fare.

It was pretty genius because I got the cheaper fare, and he upped his passenger quota on both services and thus benefit from the incentives for each.  "
"Chicken Run. This is more of a spectacle ""event"" game, can't just make it up at a party. 

Get as many people as you want, and a chicken suit. Everyone pays in $20 to buy 10 tickets which are all placed in a hat. The lucky winner becomes the chicken and dons the chicken suit. 

The chicken takes the entire pot of money and gets a 20 minute head start to run to a bar and start drinking. Chicken can only buy drinks for themselves. The remaining players must now go hunt down the chicken, if your team finds it first, you get to keep whatever money it has left. 

If your team checks a bar and the chicken isn't present, your entire team must drink a beer and take a shot before leaving the bar to check another one for a chicken. 

Obviously this works best on a college campus with lots of bars or a neighborhood with lots of bars. "

"Niagara Falls, NY. I was coming here to say this. Reddit gets a lot of international users, and I guess my good deed for the day can be helping people from saving up their hard earned vacation money and coming here.

It's a giant ghetto shithole with nothing to do other than the Falls, a Native casino (that's destroyed the city even more), a 50 year old aquarium... and that's it. The only exception is if you're an outdoors person and decide to hike the gorge under the falls/go fishing. You can spend days doing that, but 99% of people that come here are families, unprepared for real hiking in an area that claims at least a half dozen lives every year. There's a few other minor attractions, but nothing worth spending $300/night on a hotel room. There's a Starbucks! Oh and our mayoral race was decided on the fact the incumbent wanted to give away land 500 feet from the Falls park so someone could build a Days Inn and claim it was a luxury hotel, and the challenger didn't want to. The incumbent won. And bankrupted the city building a 50 mil train station that no one uses, designated his street a historic district so he could get a new roof on his house, dug up a main road with all kinds of radioactive material, had no city planner while doing that and building our police station. So the police station went 20 mil over budget with nobody watching them... ugh, I can go on and on. All of these things can be Googled and verified. Google NF Dyster (our mayor, Paul Dyster) casino funds train station. NF Dyster casino funds municipal building. NF Lewiston Road radioactive material. NF sex offenders. NF Dyster Orchard Parkway historical district.

Google street view the area north *directly across the street* from the Seneca Niagara Casino. 7th, 8th, 9th Street &amp; Ferry Ave. Seriously... someone do it then comment back. It's like those areas of Detroit you see on TV, yet it's 30 feet away from a casino you'll presumably go to with money. Good luck feeling safe walking to your car with that right there.  

The casino has terrible odds since it's the only one in town. Casinos in Vegas have to stay competitive since there's so many. This place... nobody wins. Ever. And since it opened, about 50 mom &amp; pop style restaurants and bars have closed because of the uneven playing field (casino is tax free, doesn't have to operate by state laws, pay other hotel taxes... they opened up a gas station which also doesn't pay/charge NYS taxes. Sell cigs without the insane NYS tax. Etc etc etc)

Google street view... idk, 18th Street and Cleveland, Niagara Falls NY, then move up and down 18th Street and the streets intersecting it. Niagara Ave, Ontario. Move around those side streets in Google street. And then look how close that is to the falls. Look at some of the streets even closer to the falls. 4th and Main street. Look at our Main Street. There's nothing. Nothing. A BK, a Family Dollar and our police station. Oh, one club that has decent concerts. Street view Highland Ave 

I could go on and on. But if you ever want to see Niagara Falls... go to the Canadian side. The NY side... something like 50% of people live below the poverty line or recieve some sort of social services (no joke). We have the highest concentration of sex offenders per capita in NY. So many tourists get robbed/vehicles robbed here every day. It's so fucking ridiculous. If you ever plan on coming here... make sure you do your research first. And bring some sort of protection"

"Sorry for a ""not me but someone else's story"" story, but here it is anyway: I used to work for the US Forest Service and sometimes worked with an older gentleman that had lots of interesting stories from his many years of life. But by far the most chilling tale was from when he was working in a very secluded area of wilderness and was walking through the forest when a thunderstorm hit. He had seen a opening in the hill a little while back and headed to it to take shelter. Once inside he shined his flashlight to check he wasn't going to wake up a bear or something and found the skeleton of a man, sitting in a lawn chair, with a rifle rigged up so he had been able to shoot himself. The skeleton was still wearing jeans and a flannel shirt.

"When I think back on it, there weren't really any unreasonable standing rules. More like every now and then my parents would explode on something minor to make up for the lack of parenting. 

I love my parents, but they don't seem to get the idea that not being around much fucked their kids up a bit. I was *extremely* shy and withdrawn, and my brother is a narcissist. It would take quite a few paragraphs to explain, but suffice to say their lack of checks and balances on him, and my family's doting on him legitimized his belief that everything revolves around him.

On the other hand, nobody paid attention to me, which is partially on me. I'm quite happy to fade into the background in any situation. I hate attention. Maybe cause I didn't get any when I was young and when I did it felt weird? I don't really know.

But yeah, I specifically remember the few times where my dad was shouting in anger at me, and neither made any sense. Once, he told us, during the middle of summer, when we were about 13 and 15, not to go outside while he was out. Mind you, we were 13 and 15, and literally every single day during the summer, no one was home, and we were outside unsupervised all fucking day. So my brother was like 'rules don't apply to me' and goes outside. Dad came home, starts screaming at him, then starts getting pissed at me and whacks me for not stopping him. At the time, dude was like twice my size, and no one could tell him shit, so...

Another time, on my birthday, all I wanted was a remote controlled car. So I got one. Brother proceeds to take it out while I'm not there. Dumbass tries to control it and ride a bike at the same time, runs it over and breaks it. Puts it back, doesn't tell anyone. I find it, get pissed, dad of course thinks I'm lying to cover my own ass, and I get whacked a bit. Brother thought it was funny. Instead of parenting, dad went the easy route, assigned blame and punishment, went back to doing whatever the hell it was he was doing.

Fast forward 20+ years. Brother is rapidly heading for a divorce that he just can't believe is his fault. Haven't said a word to him in maybe 3 years? Honestly lost track. I can't talk to him because he'll blame random bad shit that happened to him on something I or my best friend did like 25 years ago. Dad is disabled, lays around all day, can't understand why no one comes to visit. Mom (love her to death, but she's an idiot) makes excuses for both of them. I used to idolize my father and I glossed over a lot. Been thinking a lot about him lately and coming to terms with the fact that he's an asshole, much like my brother. Which sucks, but the truth is the best policy.

TL;DR: The lack of consistent rules was, for me anyway, worse than a strict environment."

"My family was homeless for about 3 months when I was 14, so I only have a kids perspective.

Long story short: My crackhead sister fooled my parents into moving into her crack hut with her and her family and things just plummeted immediately from there. My sister somehow managed to get access to my parent's bank account and drained their checking and savings account. My parents had absolutely no money. Shit went down and my sister and her husband kicked us out of the house. My parents weren't on the lease so we had to leave. 

Hardly any money, we didn't know anyone else, so we went to a motel and that was where we were for 3 months. It's not necessarily on the streets, but there's still that sense of unknown and fear you won't get out of your current situation. And it was hard because motels cost money as well, so my parents were probably paying about 400 a week to stay in a motel which was probably a third of their weekly income combined. All the while struggling to save up for the down payment on a house, feed me (and eventually 4 kids - my sister's kids), and more. Being a kid and having no control over my situation and the unknown was the scariest part. I was worried my parents would be at risk of having me taken away because they weren't providing enough for me (I didn't resent them by the way, they were doing what they could). Or worse, I was worried eventually we wouldn't be able to afford to stay in a motel.

It was also embarrassing. Our old apartment wasn't too far from the motel we were staying in, so I went back to taking my usual bus home from school. And the bus stopped right in front of the motel, so I'd awkwardly stand around and wait for the other kids to walk home before turning around and going into the motel. "

"Baby sat a few times for a friend of my lawyer uncle. She was insanely wealthy widow who lost her husband to a freak helicopter accident. She would sleep with her then 10 year old son both naked in the same bed and then would walk around the house thenext morning in the buff.

I understand them needing time to grieve and even occasionally sharing a bed. However the whole naked thing threw me off and I only did it a few weekends. The kid was great and loved me but was a little too touchy and cuddly. No way I was going to be around his naked.

He even did the spackling for all the ceilings and all of the paint work.

Then my mom cheated on him for a year and bought him out of the house. Now my mom and step-dad have a pretty sweet place to live, and I can tell it hurts my dad whenever he has to go by to pick up my sister and stand in the entryway of the house that he built and watch their fat dog scratch up the hardwood that he was so proud of."

"They've definitely had their problems, but oh my God, it's been such a model for me about what a healthy marriage is supposed to be. My whole family is really direct about what we want and what our intentions are as a result. To the point where we announce what we're going to do before we do it. Like, my dad will say, ""I'm really tired, so I'm just going to go watch TV by myself now in the next room."" Or, ""I need to get out of the house for a little bit, so I'm going to go play cards with my brother and then stop at CVS if anyone wants something."" And my mom, ""I'm just going to go to TJ Maxx for a few hours."" When my mom's upset about something, she's really direct about it and they have NEVER raised their voices at each other. Like when she's upset, she'll very calmly tell my dad, ""Hank, I'm really upset about what you said. When you said you forgot my birthday it made me feel hurt because I felt like you didn't care about what's important to me."" Then my dad will apologize and they'll kiss and she'll forgive him. But then my dad will go and bring back a bottle of my mom's favorite wine and a box of M and Ms or something. And that's IT. They NEVER yell at each other. At least not in front of my sisters or me.

"As someone that used to work in casino I have to agree. Also most gamblers were mentally ill or very bored old men that had nothing better to do with their time. I have some casino worker horror stories, but there isn't the place for them. 

EDIT: I return with a very late edit because some people are waiting for some stories. First I worked both in a casino and an agency for sport gambling. At casino there weren't many incidents to tell in particular, except for their stupid rule that the attendants should stand up as long there are customers and be ready every second to pay their cash outs or serve them with drinks. Guess what? Most of the shifts we had to stand up for 12 hours straight with a fake professional smile on our faces while enduring every angry cretin frustrated with their stupidity. At the end of the day, I barely felt my lags while my feet were turned purple with very inflated veins. This may not sound very impressive but trust me, you don't want to live that.

I moved from that casino to a sport gamble agency (I really have no idea for the correct term in English) because you sit down and people are cumming and leave. Wrong! First of all, on the next floor there was a restaurant and because something went wrong somewhere, there was always a very strange smell  inside. People from the casino were okayish compared with the creatures I meet there. I had no idea that the area the agency was placed was populated with the biggest creeps I'll ever meet in my life. Have you ever seen a group monkeys obsessed with a number? Those monkeys were very obsessed with 7. I swear if ever again I'll the equivalent in my language  for ""5 of 7"" I'm going to punch someone in the mouth. There was a creature that shown low signs of intelligence. It was around 35 and still living with it's mother and had no job. Most of the time it was there inside the agency, every time he saw a any line on the screen of the slot he will get very excited, starting to congratulate very loudly the ""winner"". It was annoying for everyone. Every time it played it will always lose and get very pissed and start to swear and yell and do like a baboon inside a heated oven. It will always put the phone on speaker and talk very loudly with its mother that called him often. It is beyond redemption.

Other specimens were two brothers. A bit more supportable that the Dumbfuck mentioned earlier, but they will get very pissed for losing at slots and cry like animals. There where also few others doing the same and the worse part was that the manager had no interest to ban any of them for their behavior because they broke no rule she said. The medium was very toxic and tiresome because of them having all day around inside making the sport betting part even harder.

Time to get to the sport gamble part. There were two old men coming every day to make kilometric tickets on sports on the lowest bet possible. I have no idea if they were hopping to guess the results on a shitton of matches and get rich by betting a very small amount of money, or they were just bored hell spawns that were there to make the day even worse. Sometimes the stupid software will crash for having to process too many matches and I'll have to write their tickets manually again, creating a long beyond them and pissing the Hell Lady I'll talk about next.

There was this other thing from the deeps of hell looking like an old lady. It will be there from the moment the agency open and will leave at the end. It is very obsessed with Kino (some shitty kind of lottery with extractions every 5 minutes). It will put a lot of tickets for every tour, resulting in me creating more tickets that was humanly possible, sometimes without any break for the entire day. The only time when I wasn't placing tickets for her was when there were other customers waiting in line. The worse is that it wasn't alone, sometimes there was another like it.

In the contract my shift was for 12h, but I had to be there half hour earlier for the opening and leave much later because I had to register every won ticket. Because of Hell Lady I had to register hundreds of them, meaning I had to squeeze together the winning tickets with the matching receipt of them. Usually you do this after you validate a winning ticket, but because I was doing countless of them I had no time for it so I had to remain like two extra hours over time to do this and other stuff.

If the fact my last job itself fucked me in the head so hard because the customers and the very toxic medium doesn't make it sound very scary well is time for the end of the story. After two months I decided to say ""fuck it"" and quit. I had one more week there and an accident happened because I was very tired already and I gave someone the winning with an extra 0, resulting in a very big sum. Oh well, if they were humans they will understand and let me repay the loss in installments during a period of time, but they demanded all the money back in few days. Next day they started to accuse me of fraud because they saw me on camera ""how I put a ticket for myself"" and that's illegal. After I contested that, they accused me of actually being the accomplice of that gambler and it was our plan all along to steal from them, thus being the reason why I was to ken to quit faster from that place. 

Two months of stress followed up trying to solve this mess. I started to feel into a crippling depression and anxiety. On first days I hopped to be hit by a car or get killed by a maniac in the middle of the street and end this shit up. Then I was starting to think at the most efficient suicide method. In the end maybe they realized they fucked up and withdraw any reclamation against me because they left me alone. After this period of stress I was left with some trauma but I had no power to sue them and fail because my shitty country is very corrupt and a well placed bribe will fuck you up forever and my mental state was decaying really badly and another process will make it worse.

I'm better now, even that I'm very anxious to get a new job and I really need one. I had to drop Uni in my last year because I wasn't able to continue it. My relationship with my parents was affected a lot because they are believing their story.

Excuse me for any grammar mistake, typo or whatever, but it was a long day and I'm too tired to double check it. Now I need to play some ESO and recharge my happiness. Cya!

"Ke$ha's songs have always been a ""guilty pleasure"" kind of thing for me, but I think [the music video for Die Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOubzHCUt48) is a masterpiece of tongue-in-cheek nods at all the Illuminati conspiracy theory bullshit that was really prevalent with pop music in the late 2000's-early 2010's. 

There's no way all that isn't intentionally put there to fuck with Illuminati conspiracy theorists. The pentagram, upside down crosses, pyramids, close up shots of her eye, human and animal orgies, her sitting on a throne and having people bow at her feet. Perfect. And I say all this as someone that believed in all that shit at the time."
"We weren't married, just dating- but she made it seem like there was no one else in the picture. So I started paying most of her expenses and spent most days with her- talking to the womb; playing music for it; reading to it; etc.

Everything felt official. Doctor visits together, had the baby shower, I even picked out the child's name. About a week before birth, she calls me crying. No words, just sobbing when I answer the phone. Not sure how, but I just knew right then. I asked if there was someone else and she said maybe.

I hung up and drove to her house to reassure her that it was okay- that I wasn't mad, and no matter what happens, everything will work itself out. Of course I was lying. I was fucking furious, I just didn't wanna stress out a pregnant woman.

Fast forward to the delivery room and the other guy isn't there; hell, he's not even in town. Everyone there was convinced the child was mine after seeing him. It was a beautiful experience, just too surreal with everything hanging over it so I was at least cognizant enough not to sign the birth certificate. 

Afterwards, all parties involved basically agreed to keep our distance until paternity was established. Both of us took separate DNA tests a few weeks after, and I figured our test results would take the same amount of time to come back.

Nope.

His came back in a week- mine took a month. Her and her family knew I wasn't the father but never told me. They just let me sweat it out on my own for 3 more weeks. I don't think I've ever felt such a conflicting amount of emotions as I did the moment I read those results. And I still think that entire family is trash for keeping the news from me, but I don't have to live with them so, silver linings.

I know you specifically said husbands, but damn if that didn't feel carthartic af to type."

"So disappointing-- a girl from elementary school messaged me on Facebook years ago and I was blown away!  We were great friends at that age but we grew apart when I moved.  We got caught up and chatting for a hour or so and then she starts about this ""great opportunity"" basically a pyramid scheme to sell workout shakes.

I felt so betrayed, like I was the one excited to reunite with her and the whole time she's secretly tapping her foot like ""when can I just get to the sales pitch""

Can you tell me everything about yourself?
"A bit of a different perspective here, from someone viewing the whole mess as a relative. The husband was severely fucked over by the wife purely because she could. She divorced him in a no-fault state, providing her with immediate out-of-pocket support from him until the end of the divorce, as well as all bills paid. Now this doesn't sound so bad...if the wife wasn't an abusive, vindictive, bipolar monster. He's a gentle man, you know...the good husband type. But she just kept at it , arguing with family, abusing children, attempting suicide by sleeping pills, the works. The woman was an absolute trainwreck. And due to the laws of the state, despite firing 4 attorneys, and telling all of them ""oh just send the attorney costs to my husband, have him pay"", the court just shrugged their shoulders.

And the divorce carried on for nearly 4 years because the state did not require a settlement be made, so she just kept declining all of his offers while continuing to bask in free income. It even got to the point where he was offering half a mil over the next 4 years and she said 'go fuck yourself'. Over those 4 years his appearance and personality was like that of a president serving a term. It was absolutely awful to see. 

Edit; 

consolation: kids are all adults and mostly unaffected by the divorce.

Heartbreaker: divorce started after 27 years of marriage. So no, it wasn't a newlywed thing. Life's not always peachy after the first half decade.

If it makes it any better though the woman is mentally psychotic (unrelated to the bipolar) so this wasn't a standard ""falling out of love"" thing."

"My elementary school had ""recess duty"" in which people who weren't actually teachers (and had no job outside of the thirty minutes of recess duty and lunch supervision) would watch the kids play to make sure they're safe. 

First off, they didn't give a shit about safety. I was doing some dumb shit right in front of them and still broke my leg.

Every single one of them was on a power trip every single day. When they supervised lunch, they would turn off the lights and demand complete silence from a room full of 1st through 3rd graders, which is obviously hard to maintain for ten minutes. 

One of them got mad at a kid for sneezing, or during the silent time she would say ""NO SNIFFLING!"" and extend the amount of time that we had to be quiet as punishment. 

She wrote me up for ""yawning in her face"" when I was across the room, first off, and who cares if I yawned? 

One time my jacket was slightly out of bounds of the playground, but it was freezing so I asked them if I could go grab it. She could see it, and would be able to see me go get it, but refused to let me get it. I just went for it anyway because it was like 40 degrees outside and she wrote me up for it. 

EDIT: I just remembered something else! One time the milk at lunch was so expired that it was chunky and tasted like soap. I told the lunch monitor and she  told me just to shut up and drink it. I was like, that's probably not safe, so I started telling the people at my table not to drink it since it's rotten. Mrs. fucking lunch monitor got pissed that I was warning my classmates and sent me to the office. "
"One of my friends is dating someone who had red flags - a lot of them. Domestic violence accusations, two kids from a previous relationship he does not see, an uncontrollable temper, drinks wayyyy too much.

"This. If it weren't for the actions of a few good Samaritans, I would have died as a result of being blackout drunk. It wasn't me, and whatever it was was angry, irrational, self-destructive, and violent. Blew a .33 at the hospital, and had a very serious injury which took many months to overcome.

I've since stopped drinking almost entirely after realizing how close to dying I was. I will never, ever drink alcohol to the point where I'm even approaching 'kinda drunk' ever again. 

Edit: Elaborated more to demonstrate the seriousness of being blackout drunk. Don't do it, don't even get close to it, you can die.

"My grandfather did this to me from the dead. I was 20 and working heavily in the biolopids lab making control stuff for our new langmuir troughs. I thought I was the best wire wrapper and solderer in the world. I didn't need to use wire wrapping  but I did just to show off.   

My grandmother asked me to help clean her garage and let me keep my grandfather's old stuff. He worked for control systems Incorporated and was in Houston during the Apollo flights. Anyways I look at his collection of plugin circuit boards and am awed. I've been told many times he didn't have great patience and was a jerk but these handmade boards I found were skillfully made that must have taken a long time. Perfect temp for soldering, tight wire wrapping that survived 20 years, perfectly uniform height of components, perfect bends. Over a hundred little boards used to correct analog computers for timing and voltage. His components were organized meticulously and secure.

As far as I know, you only need to pay for your days spent while living in the hospital, the ambulance drive and doctors making sure you didn't die doesn't cost anything (unless it's some very specific and rare operation where they need to call in some sort of specialist that is not on site)."

"Almost got kidnapped one time. It was 2005, and around Christmas time this big van with Nevada plates came creeping through our neighborhood. I live in a culdesac and it's only about a quarter mile long with about 6 houses. My mom noticed him 3 days in a row and decided one day to hop in her minivan and follow him. He noticed her following him and began to speed away frantically. My mom phoned the police but nothing happened.

Fast forward 5 months it's may, and fifth grade for me was almost over. We had a half day and a substitute teacher that day. My classroom phone rang and I was told a relative was outside to pick me up. The class did the classic ""ooooo"" and I figured because it was a half day maybe my dad wanted me to go home for something. Instead of going right outside I went to to the office, to see who had called and was here. The secretary was surprised to hear that someone had called my class to release me, she would have been the one to do it.

She called the middle and high school, which are connected because we are k-12 and neither of them had called me down, figuring because I had older siblings there. So the secretary waled me back to class and when speaking with the substitute the sub told her that it was a man's voice on the phone. Immediately the school went into lockdown, apparently a man had gained access to our schools phone line, found my classroom and requested me to leave the building. My parents were notified immediately and my dad came to the school in a matter of minutes. 

We reviewed the security tapes and could see a man standing outside a big van on his cell phone looking and a sheet of paper, somehow this man knew I had a substitute teacher, and that I could have been vulnerable that day.
Later that night after a police escort home, and a weird day overall we heard a vehicle ripping down our road.
 My dad rushes to the window to see a big van with Nevada plates driving through mine and my neighbors lawn circling, tearing up the grass and flashing his high beams. My dad grabbed his gun and we all went into the basement, calling the cops. 

The man was never identified, and to this day we don't know what could have happened if I didn't stop at the school office first instead of walking out the doors. "

If the cameras caught us doing something other than standing close by her, we'd also turn into a mannequin.

It backfired on her. We ended up hiding in the clothes racks some more so that the cameras couldn't see us. "

"He wrote me a kind, sincere email that mentioned he saw something we had in common and that he would be really pleased to know more about me. I read his profile which was really different. He didn't talk about how he works hard and plays hard, loves to travel, how important family and friends is to him, etc. etc. It was short, descriptive, and to the point. (As further proof he did not understand that ""rules,"" his picture made him look good but was not that flattering as I would later find out -- he was much better looking than his picture.) 

His emails were not very long, but they had a lot of content and were warm and articulate, and at least gave me the impression that I was the only one he was interested in at the time -- rather than he was juggling a lot of interactions at once.

When he called, he told me a story about how a woman he had met online had come over for what was obviously (to me) a booty call. I was really taken by him telling this yarn of his ""strange"" encounter -- a woman he barely knew dropped by, tipsy, late at night for a quick visit. I liked how frank he was and how he treated me like a friend right away, rather than like someone he was trying to charm or to get on the hook. "

"It really depends on your age.

Most orgies are going to involve  people in their 30's to 50's. They are more comfortable with their bodies and relationships. When I was 20, I would have thought them gross, had I been involved involved in one (And naturally, desperately wanted to be) . Now that I am nearly 40, they are pretty damned awesome, but can be boring.

You know how every once in a while you have a party where everyone has a blast, and so you try to have the same party a month later but it just isn't the same? They are very much like that.

Sometimes the right combination of bodies, moods, and whatever else comes together, and you have a great time that you will remember forever. Other times you will be sitting there wondering how the guy who installed the sheetrock made such clean seams, and how you can get home to watch a rerun of Rick and Morty.


Having been involved in both my twenties and thirties with my Wife, here is my take. FTR, we are both ""Attractive"", in that we get hit on in bars, our exes still flirt with us on FB, and we generally get a lot of attention at swing events (Even after three kids).


I am a guy.


Twenties, prior to the event:

I looked around a lot, and tried to anticipate who I could bang. I got jealous at guys doing the same to my Wife. I judged a lot of folks that I didn't deem attractive. I tried to be ""Cool"".


During: I was annoyed that we weren't doing some of the things that other people were doing. I was annoyed at old people touching me. I was annoyed at the conversation going on.

I enjoyed having sex with other ladies. I enjoyed watching my wife having sex with other ladies. 







Thirties, prior to the event:

 I look around and try to decide who looks like they would be fun to bang, regardless of age, or (to a certain extent) looks. I enjoy watching guys flirt with my wife. 


During: I'm annoyed with twenties. For pretty much all of the reasons I listed about myself above. They are a bunch of immature showoff's (as we were), who have a shit ton of hangups  (as we did),  that recoil if you accidently touch their arm (as we did), and get frustrated at the fact that we can take a break and discuss our favorite band before going back to it (as we did ).


Nowadays, I see some really cute twenties girl that touches me and wants to go farther, but would rather bang the 49 yo lady with stretch marks because SHE CAN FUCK. 

I enjoy having sex with other ladies. I enjoy watching my wife have sex with other ladies. I enjoy watching my wife pleasure other men (and the handshakes after).

So, to answer the question of what I wish I had known- it would be like asking about any other general question in regard to life- Marriage, kids, first house, career. There really isn't a way to know before experiencing these things. I think it might have been nice to understand the kissing policy most new lifestyle people have, but we had it as well, so that wasn't really a thing.


To answer the question of what you can expect, regardless of age- a bunch of like-minded people of different maturity levels in a group having varying level of sexual congress. The one thing that is a constant (While there may be some moments that could be) IT ISN'T PORN.

And we will all be friends after.


Edit: I want to add, after many messages asking how to get in on one, that orgies are not generally something one goes to, they are something that happens.

Yes, you CAN go to an orgy- Find a sex club in your state, and they will have an orgy room. These are something to be experienced, but are generally lame (for various reasons). As a single guy, you will likely not be allowed into the room. It will be EXPENSIVE for a single male to attend. Several hundred dollars, only to be sexual frustrated at the fact that there is sex everywhere, and you aren't part of it.

The other option is to be in the swing lifestyle, and join a club. There will be house parties, and at these parties an orgy may or may not break out. When they happen, they are almost always AWESOME, and something that members of the club will bring up as a ""Remember that time..."" topic for years to come. Most clubs will require you to be a couple, and not a single male. 

If you are a single male, here is my advice: Take a female friend that is interested (Explain that you just want to check out the scene, not have sex with her. If you want to have sex with her, find another female friend. Looks do not matter) and have her be your partner for the night. Be polite, clean, and calm. Chat with people, be fun. These parties are more ""Backyard BBQ"" than ""Bang Bros."" at the onset.

Make conversation and flirt with couples, particularly husbands (Don't flirt with the husband), even if they may not be your ideal attractiveness level. If you do this, a couple will eventually invite you to another party (Or perhaps bang you that night), and you go from there. Think of it as a sex RPG.


If you are a single female, here is my advice: Show up. 

This will literally be the safest place you have ever been if you are looking to get your rocks off. There is a code in the lifestyle that you will not find in a bar or club- ""No, means no."". Nobody will be offended. Nobody will pressure you. Period. If anyone DOES pressure you, which I have never witnessed, tell the host, or any other person there. It will be dealt with swiftly and severely. If anyone gets pushy, you will instantly have a multitude of big brothers and sisters taking care of the issue. Our lifestyle works because we can say ""Not tonight"", and nobody's feelings are hurt.

Finally, orgies are a slice of an overall sexual lifestyle. They are not something that routinely happen. (Or they might, depending on the club or situation. If I start the ""Wichita Orgy Club"", well yeah, that's what is expected)

Edit #2: In the swinger community, people refer to themselves as being in the ""Lifestyle"". ""Orgies"" are a part of this lifestyle , but not a major point.


Think of it this way:

There are people who are ""Gamers"".

What does that mean? Single player GTA V? Multiplayer Halo? FPS? RPG? RTS? Console or PC?

Does it mean tabletop games? Board? Chance? Strategy? RPG?

Does it mean something else? Darts? Croquet? LARP?

Think of swinging like gaming: An orgy would be akin to multiplayer Halo. It's part of the scene, but not necessarily the only thing you play, and a small part of it at that.




Edit #3: To me, an orgy is anything involving 4 females and 4 males in the same room, all interacting with each other. Obviously gay orgies would be a different group entirely.

"Not sure wether this makes me fortunate or unfortunate, but the most horrifying thing I've ever seen is completely imaginary. 

I was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic at 14, although I first started showing early signs at 7. I hallucinate constantly, visually and audibly, and the actions of my visual hallucinations can cause me pain. I'd assume they can cause pleasant feelings from touch as well, but I've yet to experience that. The entire manifestation of my disease seems to be attempting to make me as miserable as possible, and is almost like another entity in my head. That being said, most of my visual hallucinations are human like figures, entirely black and lacking any real defining features. They don't resemble anyone I know as far as I can tell. They do however seem to enjoy making me as uncomfortable as possible by just leering endlessly. They're always there. Usually just watching me. It feels like I'm being criticized constantly on every movement, every action. It's made me incredibly self conscious over the years. 

Anyway, I was sitting in my room at the age of 15, it was late at night, my family had been asleep for hours. Suddenly I heard a loud thud behind me, I'd been hallucinating for a couple years at this point and didn't think anything of it, assuming it was another fake bump in the night. Then I felt a hand over my mouth, and a swift sharp, agonizing pain in ribs. Still to this day I consider it the most painful thing I've ever felt. The feeling of the hand left my face and my head collapsed onto my laptop, I grabbed my side, which felt warm and wet. I saw a shadow slip out my bedroom door as my vision became blurry and the room started to spin, and for a full 20 minutes, I could not move. I was in too much pain, my body was going into shock, I managed to peek down at my side and it appeared I was bleeding heavily. I could feel the blood running down my body and hear it dripping onto the carpet. My mind was racing with thoughts of my family being murdered. I heard my dogs barking wildly, unable to get to the intruder as we'd installed a door at the end of the hallway to the back of the house, so the cats could have some peace from them. My heart pounded louder than I could deal with, I heard screaming of how much of a failure I was, how I was a complete idiot, that it was all my fault that my family had been killed. Tears rolled down my face, and finally I let out a scream of some sort. A few moments later my sister opened my door, turned on the light, and the nightmare vanished. The pain in my ribs dulled significantly but still burned. I lifted my head from my keyboard and the pool of blood below me was gone, I pulled my hands from my side and they were suddenly clean and dry. My sister looked at me with a worried expression, asking what was wrong, wondering why I was bawling and screaming at 2 am. I sobbed even harder and all I could offer as an explanation was ""I'm just insane."" 

That was the night I realized I would have to deal with this for the rest of my life. That I would experience traumas and stresses that never existed for the rest of my life. That I would question the motive and intention of every single person, relative or stranger, for the rest of my life. But hey, at least in the end, most of my fears and worries end up being made up.

"I used to be a very, very racist person. It wasn't due to my upbringing, it was because of my first boyfriend who was/is a major neonazi. An actual neonazi, as in he had thousands of dollars worth of nazi paraphernalia and would go on hour long rants about how he wanted to commit genocide against those who weren't white. 

He polluted my mind by putting me up on a pedestal. He would constantly comment on how pure I was, and would go on and on about how I would be his perfect aryan princess. I was 14 entering the relationship, and he was 19. He pretty much groomed me and forced me to accept his ideals and sprout the same vitriolic racist bullshit he did because if I didn't, he would threaten me. 

What forced me to change was an interaction I had with a black woman online. We both were into the same series, and had a discussion on the forum. I had seen her post before and wanted to be her friend, and so we got to talking and we got close. Then, I found out she was black. I said some immensely ignorant things, and she just straight up told me I was an idiot. It was in the way she phrased it, how it was so matter-of-fact that I just realized that yeah, I was an idiot. 

It made me realize I didn't actually hold any of those opinions, and it made me realize just how harmful they were. Up until that point, I hadn't really interacted with poc, I live in a white area, always had white friends, I never knew of the impact racism actually had. I never saw it for myself, it didn't exist in my eyes. So that's why it was so easy for me to adopt racism as if it was some new trend. 

Honestly, I look back on all that and feel so sick. I've educated myself a lot since then, and have not spoken to my old ex for over 5 years. "

The wide, harsh desert has a bunch of stuff to do, and between enemies and npc's it takes a really good eye to notice the black sesame—a single black pixel. Talk to them, and they says they're kinda down ever since fighting with the white sesame. Now of course you hunt for a white pixel, with considerable difficulty. The white sesame asks you to tell black that white got over it, and will always love them. You go back to black, tell them the message, and they cry.

And that's it. You don't get anything, no item, no (argh) achievement unlocked; only the feeling of having provided emotional support for two pixels. You never see them again."

------

There's an annual competition held in Northern California, known as ""The Kinetic Sculpture Race."" Teams come from around the state (or even around the world) to compete in a days-long time trial in amphibious, man-powered vehicles that they've designed and built. During the year that I attended, there were quite a number of incredibly creative entrants - including a large yellow septic tank that had been outfitted with wheels and a propeller - and I was absolutely giddy at the prospect that *my* team might actually win.

Unfortunately, a small obstacle stood between me and a chance at piloting the kinetic sculpture that I'd helped build: In order to compete, each entrant needed to be at least eighteen years old... and I hadn't quite hit that mark yet. In fact, *most* of our team was underage, given that the majority of us were members of the high school robotics team. We might have been more worried about the age-related mandate, except for the fact that having the fastest vehicle was only *one* of the ways that someone could win.

One of the *other* ways was to pursue the coveted ""Most Creative Cheaters"" award.

See, the race in question was more of a lighthearted opportunity to show off the sculptures than it was an actual competition. Everyone still did their best to win, of course, but playful shenanigans (like bribing a judge with stickers to ""overlook"" certain transgressions) were both expected and encouraged. Given that our team was lacking in legal adults, and yet still intent on attending (and competing), one of my friends suggested that we all create our own fake identification... with the caveat being that they had to be *very obviously* counterfeit.

To give you some idea of how the final results turned out: The young man who had originally suggested the tactic showed up with a card that looked like it was the illegitimate offspring of a tie-dyed shirt and a flamingo. His portrait featured him grinning from ear to ear, and the only visible text read ""I'm eighteen. Really. Trust me."" That was the *most* believable of our fake identification, too. (Mine was actually just a scrap of paper on which I'd hastily scrawled ""Max is totally an adult,"" because I'd forgotten to make one until after we'd already arrived at the competition.)

In the end, everyone on my team got to race. Hell, we even dressed alike, so that we could [switch out competitors](http://i.imgur.com/F6QFTM0.jpg) whenever we got tired. We did pretty well overall, and even though we didn't win any of the speed-centric events, we *did* get to go home with that ""Most Creative Cheaters"" trophy. The man who handed it off to us even took special care to list all of our various pranks, stunts, capers, and japes...

... up to and including the fact that we weren't actually allowed to be there.

**TL;DR: I was a member of a counterfeiting ring that manufactured an unlicensed vehicle.**"

"It's not really a secret, but something I just didn't pursue until my dad had died. We're not a very open family. I don't know the basic things that are pretty common for a family to know. Like how your parents met, or what your mom was doing when she went into labor. I barely know anything about my mom or my dad's childhood or life, even though they had very interesting lives, and I've never wanted to pursue it. 

But I was talking to my grandma, on my mom's side, a few months ago. At this point my dad had been dead for about a year and a half and I honestly don't remember how the conversation took this turn but I asked her about something my dad had mentioned to me as a child. 

Apparently, he had a wife before my mother. My parents had me pretty old so this was feasible. One day while he was at work, and she was home, someone broke in and murdered her. I can't remember if there was sexual assault involved, and no one who is currently alive is really clear on whether she was pregnant or not. There was really no rhyme or reason to the crime as far as I know. But he was the one who came home and found her dead. 

It really chills me to picture my dad in that position. Like I said, we aren't an open family. Vulnerability and intimate emotion is shoved down and I personally feel incredibly uncomfortable opening up to anyone in my family or seeing anyone open up. But I sincerely hope he got to see her again, and meet any unborn child he might have had, in his afterlife. My only solace in his death is knowing how goddamn hard and miserable his life was and hoping he's at peace now. "

"In many states, (1) there is a presumption that any child born during marriage is the child of the husband, and (2) if that presumption isn't rebutted by scientific evidence within a certain amount of time [i.e., if the kid isn't tested within a year or whatever], then that presumption becomes irrebuttable, such that the kid will be conclusively treated as the husband's child, no matter what the results of later tests show.

"Here's a more light hearted answer to this thread. I was camping with my family when I was five and playing on the beach unsupervised, but the beach was across a short dirt road from our campsite where my parents sat enjoying the view, so they could probably see the top of my head ish. And as kids do, I made a friend with another girl around my age and her sister. We played for awhile until their mom said they were leaving to explore the island about 500 m down the beach from where we were. She asked me if I wanted to come and of course I did! So we went there. 

We spent the afternoon on the island exploring the small old buildings and beaches, their mom brought sunscreen and snacks and drinks, and a couple hours later she returned me to where I was on the beach and I crossed the road back to my campsite. 

My parents weren't there anymore, so I waited awhile and when the showed up they came with police (very small town, family friends). They both gave me the biggest hug and didn't give me much freedom the rest of the summer, and now we joke about it from time to time. I never saw the girls or the mom again. "

"This is weird to me because my cousin described something similar chasing him when we were younger. My dad and his dad were down on the beach close to where we stayed during the summer and he wanted to go down to them. Was around 11pm and was dark and we were hanging out in a group together and I wasn't really into the idea. He headed off and about 15 mins later, he came running up the path and fell into our arms when he got there, snots and tears.

He described exactly what you just did, 8ft tall shadow figure sprinting over the sand towards him, like it wasn't affected by it and covering the distance at super human speed. My cousin sprinted towards us, and decided to crawl through some brush as a short cut, but he said the thing kept coming at him. He eventually got up to the path where we were and I have never seen somebody so afraid in my life. We took the piss out of him a bit and said he was seeing things, a shadow, a horse, anything other than a fucking malevolent spirit or whatever. And I still believe that it was a weird imagination thing, but his personality - tough guy, quiet enough and not really a bulls hitter - always made me pause for thought.


To this day if you mention it to my cousin he will recount the story the same way. He is convinced it happened and time has not made him rationalise it. Weird shit man."

"I found out that my dad was a rather successful cocaine dealer in the 80's (before I was born). Had tons of nice vehicles to launder the money but eventually got caught.

I confronted my parents about it and they told the whole story."

"I have experienced something like this in the Woods of Portola Valley. I frequently camped by a stream, maybe 3-4 weeks total camping time if you add it up, and always there was the sound of the stream in the background, as well as gentle wind, boughs cracking and occasional animal sounds (little birds, crickets...you know...life.) 

Well one night I was woken up by a nightmare of a black/greyish figure standing by our campsite *just standing there.* It had no features. It was just a dark/black color. I don't usually have paranormal fantasies or dreams so this was very scary for me.

It scared the shit out of me, so I woke up with a start. 

I wake up and then shit just feels wrong. I wake up my SO and tell him I had a nightmare. As I am waking him up, I notice there is no sound. As in, ZERO sounds of air moving, creek sound is gone etc. And the entire campground (for which we were there alone) feels extremely...oppressive. Like heat with no heat. 

And I just have this feeling like we need to go, like ""NOW."" I have never had a feeling like this since. 

The more I think about it now the more creepy it feels. My So thank god was listening to me (he had some ghost experiences growing up and he noticed the lack of sound as well) and we pack up and leave probably in less than 30 minutes.

That feeling of sticky, angry oppression didn't leave us until we were completely back in town.  

This is the stuff thats going to sound craziest: My car would not drive over 15-25 mph all the way down the hill. No it wasn't in second gear. No we weren't high. My SO and I tried everything but I kept saying ""we need to get out now.""

As soon as we got to town it went back to normal.

I have no explanation for it to this day. "

"Back when I was living in Louisiana, there was a route between my house and my previous place of work that passed through a somewhat squalid section of town. The street was dotted with potholes, most of the buildings were in a state of moderate disrepair, and the preferred pastime for many of the denizens seemed to involve standing around and glaring at anyone who happened to catch their attention. Suffice to say, it wasn't the most inviting of locales... but it got me to work faster than any other option, so I frequently drove through it.

One day, not long after I had started commuting through the area, I pulled up to an intersection and slowed to a halt. In the split second that it took for my car to stop moving, I was suddenly attacked by a thin woman in ill-fitting clothing. She ran up from out of nowhere, pounded on my window, and started shouting at me.

""*You got product?!*"" the woman yelled. Her voice was like that of an obnoxious parrot crossed with a small dog's growl. ""I see your hat! You wearing a hat! *You got product?!*""

I did not, in fact, have product. Hell, I didn't even know what ""product"" *was*, nor why my choice in headwear apparently marked me as having any. What I *did* have was a pressing need to be somewhere else, so I floored my car's accelerator, pulled away, and spent the next several minutes glancing around for any signs of pursuit.

Anyway, if your hat draws unwanted attention, you might be in a bad neighborhood.

**TL;DR: A woman assaulted my car because my hat excited her.**

"Ok, throw away because I don't need my SO to be reminded that I used to be this fucked up of a person. 
Backstory: My best friend got me to sleep with her (I'm female) on my birthday. And many times after. We had a sort of best-girl-friends-that-also-fucked relationship going on. Obviously I started to develop real feelings for her, even though we would both sleep with other people. 

Time passed and we got a little more serious. Then she met a guy in our apartment building, and after hooking up for a couple of weeks, they made things official. It kinda crushed me, but I persevered. We remained best friends, with her constantly stringing me along the whole time (telling me she still wants to be with me, etc.)

 Flash forward a couple months, him and I were the last ones up drinking one night. One thing lead to another, and he propositioned me pretty strongly. I accepted and we hooked up in the bathroom. I didn't feel guilty at all. I was doing it out of spite to her for all the emotional stress she was causing me by fucking with my head and stringing me along. I continued to sleep with him for the next three-four years. 

Two years in, she decides she's just not happy with him anymore, but cannot financially afford to leave him. So she starts her old shit, saying she's always been in love with me, and she wants us to be together and be a family (They had had a son by this point). So, me being on her hook, I went for it. We were now sleeping together. And that's pretty much the jist of this story. I was sleeping with him out of spite for how she was treating me, and I was sleeping with her because I was blindly in love. They eventually broke up, and I no longer talk to either of them, but I always wonder if they ever realized that for a couple of years, they were both cheating on each other with the same person. "

"I was never bullied before this, but sophomore year of high school the kid that sat across from me in art always bullied me. Eventually I worked up the nerve to tell the redneck ""you look like you were conceived by your dad fucking one of your goats."" This made his bullying 10x worst for the next few minutes. So I walked across the room acting like I was doing something important. On my way back, I grabbed one of the chairs and hit him as hard as I could. Knocked out a tooth, gave him a hairline nose fracture and a big gash on his forehead. 

The other kids at my table fessed up that he was bullying me and the super intendent found out the principle knew of the bullying and refused to acknowledge it, so we BOTH got a 2 week suspension, and they changed HIS schedule so we wouldn't be in the same class again. 


Edit- since there is a war going on in these comments about whether I should have hit him with the chair or not, I definitely think it was justified. This was possibly the biggest kid in my grade, and i was honestly probably one of the smallest boys in my grade. Punching him or challenging him to a fight would have been absolutely stupid and I would have lost and the bullying would have gotten worse. Imo, if you're pussy enough to pick on someone considerably smaller than you, and no one, not even the school is doing anything about it, then you deserve it. For the people saying I was wrong to do it, I'm a psychopath, I should have just challenged him to a fight or punched him; how else would the bullying have gone away? 

If you don't think this is justifiable, you must haven't been bullied by someone way larger than you before.

An outsource I worked for knew this. And so would ramp up the 'elite' engineers right after signing a new contract, in the honeymoon period to get the 'project' work pipeline going.

And in the interim, deliver a mediocre 'just enough to meet SLA' service, because it literally didn't matter.

As long as everything appears to be getting better the 6 months before 'renewal' that counts much more in your favour than offering utterly stellar service the whole contract span.

"As you've seen by the arguments there are four major barbecue styles in the U.S.: Texas, Kansas City, Memphis, and Carolina. Texas is known for beef brisket, Memphis for ribs, Carolina for pulled pork, and Kansas City doesn't really have a signature meat, but does all of the above quite well. Technically Carolina has several local sub-styles, but those are usually distinguished most by sauce while the larger regions have more variation between them.

Wood type, meat preference, dry rub, sauce type, etc. all inform the differences between regions. My beloved KC-style saucy burnt ends are going to be very different than dry ribs which will taste nothing like vinegar-sauced pulled pork. This is part of why the arguments persist."

"I had lived a pretty risky life since being verified immortal on what was the equivalent of March 15th, 44 B.C. I had been approached a week before by someone I thought I recognized, but couldn't put my finger on. He had only introduced himself as ""Pater Tempus"". He informed me that I had only to perform one act, a very serious and historical one, and get away with it, and I would be immortal until a word of my choosing was uttered. I would not feel pain, and would heal up in seconds.

I had thought long and hard about what word I would pick, having been given a week to make a decision. Of course I was going to do it. I had no qualms about killing, having served in the Roman army. Who wouldn't want to be immortal? To fully experience everything the world would go through, to become the richest, most powerful, and smartest person to ever exist...

I have long forgotten my original name, as I have used thousands over the centuries in different times and places. Now I just go by Robert Miller. It doesn't stand out in any way, is easy to remember, and is easy to pronounce in any language.

Since receiving my gift, I had left Rome, and as the centuries progressed, I was certain I would be immortal. That is, until last week. I had simply been at the grocery store and walked past a man who had a brand new tattoo walking with his buddy.

I instantly recognized it. I had thought back to my many battles and adventures which would have killed any mortal being. The time I was gutted in 15th century Japan...apparently they didn't take nicely to foreigners just showing up one day.

Then there was the time I took a direct hit from an artillery shell at the Somme, nobody noticed the immortal dude flying a hundred feet in the air.

But these two clowns at a supermarket? I wasn't about to let them kill someone who'd personally feasted with Henry the Eighth and had a romp with Marilyn herself!

I strolled right up to the young man (early 30's, but your standards change when the world's ""official"" oldest person is over 2,000 years younger than you) and told him ""You know what that tattoo means don't you?"" He looked over at me and said ""Oh this one, I just got it today, it's cool cause it's in Latin! It says...""

It was discovered when one of these counselors started noticing his patients suddenly not showing up. He called one of them and found out he was at this facility in florida. "

"The day my ex husband met me, he was coming off the back of something like this. Bear with me, given this happened in 1989. 

We met on a Wednesday. He remembers leaving home the Tuesday afternoon for a recreational drive, driving about 200km, doing what he intended, then turning round and going home. Halfway up a large mountain, in the dark, his motorcycle breaking down. Then he coasted back down the mountain and staying at a local store. He and I hooked up and he stayed at my place, planning to stay till his bike was fixed. 

We later found out he actually left home on the Sunday. His flatmate called his parents and they reported him as a missing person and he was on the news. He has zero memory of this and everything is telescoped into a coherent narrative. "

"Abuse via food is horrible. My ex was a narcissist, and narcissists like to feel like victims. Sometimes, he would insist on cooking for me, which seemed really sweet on the surface. But he would insist on using ingredients that he ***absolutely knew*** I was allergic to. When I wouldn't eat it, he would go to all our friends and tell them what an ungrateful bitch I was for not eating the food he cooked for me. He really hammed it up. He did this with a lot of things and I lost a lot of friends because of it. 

It manifested in me being really uncomfortable whenever someone cooked for me. I hated telling people what I was allergic to, worried they'd use the knowledge against me. It sounds completely absurd now, but it was a problem for a long time.  

I think it's really horrible how that guy treated you. I hope you're doing better now.

"Ugh...my parents were like this in my teen years. It did nothing to help me learn to have a healthy relationship with screens. If anything, it just made them more desirable to me.

I'm a parent myself and so long as my kid (10yo) has good grades, is behaving well, and is caught up with chores/responsibilities, and aren't putting on weight (which is much more about diet than exercise), have at the electronics/video games as much as you want. That's the only limit for me: like all fun things, don't let it get in the way of responsibilities. Hell, if anything it's something my son and I bond over and we've always loved gaming together.

What a shock! He actually doesn't mind doing other things because he knows he's not being forced too and because video games aren't some ""special"" thing. While his best friend's parents have always limited it and when he's over my house he practically begs me to binge on Netflix and Xbox and wants to do nothing else.

I really don't understand why some parents, of all the more important battles to fight and of all of the fish to fry choose to fry this one with stupid artificial arbitrary limits like that with a timer and everything. It reeks of being an overprotective control freak with serious issues of having to micro-manage their kids to me. ""Oh but they need to learn to entertain themselves without screens!""

Why? Are smartphones, the internet, TV, and video games going to drop off the face of the earth one day or something? Teaching kids to have fun without them is like teaching them how to write cursive: it's obsolete and no longer necessary and does them few favors in a world where they're growing up surrounded by them."

"Alternatively, try a hammock.

I have a $3000 king size bed and a $40 hammock ($90 if you count the stand for indoor use).  I get *much* better sleep in the hammock than any bed I've ever slept in.

Edit: Going on 8 months now in the hammock

Alright, there are enough questions here about posture and back pain.  No, I haven't experienced a single day with back problems since moving to a hammock.  I used to get back pain in my bed every now and again because I would toss in my sleep and wind up in a really unnatural position.  A hammock limits your movement so you can't do that.

Also, there are plenty of places in the world where people aren't sleeping on spongy mattresses.  If you think the only way to have a healthy back is with an expensive mattress, you've bought into marketing too much.  Hammocks are everyday sleeping hardware for people in perpetually humid climates, too, because the moisture will ruin a bed.

Your back is almost entirely straight if you have your hammock set up properly.  The bend occurs at your waist.  If you put pressure on your discs, you're doing it wrong."

I must of been 6/7. My grandma and mum cooked up a plan to test what I would do if some stranger grabbed me. My grandma was to grab me from behind and see what I did.

We were stood in Woolworths and I felt a hand go over my mouth and someone start dragging me back. I start screaming and kicking. My mum turns around and sees me disappear round a corner with a hand over my mouth. Security were called. That took some explaining.

If they're really great they wont charge you a dime for putting some air in your tires and telling you ""be safe and check your pressure once in a while silly"".

"I grew up thinking minorities and women (sad fact: I am a woman) were just lazy and entitled. Not because of my interactions with them, but because I grew up in a very white, rich area where all the poor people were Mexican. And because stereotypes about women are brutal when you're a tomboy. 

It wasn't until I finally allowed myself to get upset over the way I was being treated by men (and sometimes older women) that I realized I was doing the same sort of thing to minorities. 

I knew that I wasn't a bit like the stereotypes put forth about women. And my mom wasn't, my sister wasn't, and none of my friends were... 

So how the fuck could I possibly make any sort of assumption about minorities? 

Examining my own hardships and relationship with society as a woman really opened my eyes to how difficult it is for minorities and immigrants. I try to use that lens when discussing racism because it's always easy to fall back into the old mindset when youre raised with it. But it's the second thought that counts. 

I never would have called myself racist back then. I would have said that I was a 'realist', an 'equal opportunist'. Egalitarian. I advocated for equality but refused to acknowledge the special circumstances in each group of peoples' lives that made things so difficult. I refused to see the bigger picture. White men were just better. Logical. Calm. Women were hysterical, emotional. Minorities just didn't want jobs. 

But I don't want to make it sound like I've completely healed either. I still work on making sure I'm not framing my worldview with just my race and privilege in mind. Feminism in America is constantly framed around white, mid-upper class lives and often forgets to discuss issues around poverty, immigrants, and women of color. When I noticed that many feminist sites that I frequented were starting to discuss those issues more often--especially when they referenced racism from white people-- I admittedly got a little angry. But I quickly realized it was irrational because literally nothing was being taken away from me by discussing these issues and, overall, life will be better because they were discussed. So what am I losing? I don't get to see a model on a magazine that has the same phenotypes as I do? 

Racism is weird but invasive. It doesn't make any sense but it's so easy to fall prey to it because your brain thinks it's making sense of observable patterns (or the ones we are constantly shown, anyway) . But forgets to look for a cause behind those patterns.

"My wife giving birth to my daughter when she was only 19 weeks pregnant. Technically it was a miscarriage. My wife's cervix wasn't strong enough and the baby breached something, I didn't listen to the doctor after I understood I wasn't going to be a dad anymore. My wife went through all the stages of labor for about 7 hours after that. My daughter was born only weighing 12 ounces I believe. I held her, counted her toes and fingers,and saw her heart beating from her chest. I then saw her heart beating no more.. I had my hand under her back when I was carrying her and I would slowly press on it in a rhythm similar to a heartbeat so I could see her chest rise and pretend she was alive I guess. The worst day of my life.

For most people life does (eventually) get better. So I can see why the average person would justify living through the mental anguish for the happiness later.

But having lived through all that... I can honestly see scenarios where I think it would be best to not have to live. When every moment is hell and you are in agony, even though your life is perfect and you know that you're supposed to be happy. It's indescribable.

Had I known how much I would suffer for a solid ~8 years of my life, I probably would have been happier dead. Even now, in a lucid, certifiably sane state, I recognize that I would rather not have gone through that.

If anyone is having these kinds of thoughts, please reach out for help. It's the thing that got me to finally get better. 

If all else fails and you still feel like you can't escape, run away from your life. Drop everything and go/do what you need to. Whether that's moving to Nebraska or Thailand or Sweden or Columbia. Remember that there are other, better ways to escape. But the one thing you cannot run away from is needing help. Get it."

I'm a type 1 diabetic and i used to suffer from serious chronic knee and back pain that I treated with oxycontin 80mg 3x/day and vicodin 7.5-500 2x/4hours( it was prescribed by a doctor like that although i did often take more vicodin than directed). This went on for ~6 years. 

Eventually i got to the point where i didn't like the dependence on or side effects of the drugs. So naturally i did the smart (/s) thing and quit cold turkey. 

I'm all in favor of people coming off of opiates, but for fuck sake be smart about it people. Step down your dosage under medical supervision, especially if you're on high doses.

I felt awful from the DTs plus the fact that my blood glucose level was higher than my home meter could read  (it maxes at 600). So i went to the ER (A&amp;E for you brits). 

The doctor was convinced that i was a drug seeker and that when i said, ""i feel like I'm dying, please help."" That i meant ""i want drugs, give me pills."" So he sent me home. 

My grandmother drove me back in the next day as i was barely conscious. My blood glucose was 1178 mg/dl (80-100 is ideal and &gt;200 is high).  A different doctor was there and he said that was the highest he'd seen in 20 years of medicine, and had no clue how i was alive. 

3 days into my 10 day intensive care stay that doctor who sent me home came to see me and spent about 30 minutes talking with me and apologizing for sending me home. I think he was worried i would sue, but he did seem sincere at the same time so no hard feelings. 

Haven't touched an opiate in 5 years and my last A1C was 7.6. Also, I'm pretty much pain free unless i wildly over exert myself with OP's mom. 

Much love to anyone trying to come off opiates or any other addiction. It's hard as fuck, but you can do it.

It's often stated that men make up greater portions of CEO's and homeless, the takeaway that in Western society men have greater financial mobility than women, in both directions. It's also often stated, or lamented depending on your point of view, that men are more likely than women to be judged on their merits and ability, to succeed or to fail. In western society, though I would argue around the world, men are *expected* to have drive, passion, and success, and to fail is to fall without a safety net.

If a woman does not have personal motivation and drive, to succeed in her career, or even fails despite her best efforts, it's *socially acceptable* for her to get married and not work. A stay-at-home-mother is a respected life, as child-rearing is no easy task. A stay-at-home-father is scorned as lazy, or a deadbeat.

*Many* shelters for homeless women, or women in need exist. Men's shelters are actively lobbied against, cited as ""exclusionary"" or ""sexist"".

If I fail professionally, I have a **significantly** smaller chance of getting married to a woman who will provide for me financially. Do I *want* a life of not working, personally? No, I have professional dreams and aspirations! But to know that I *could*, though of course not true for all women by any stretch, shack up with someone to take on the lion's share of my financial needs, is peace of mind.

I know that won't resonate well on Reddit, being largely middle class progressives who dislike the idea of an unfair relationship, because I am one of them. But there are millions of men and women in the world open to such a ""safety net"", and while I dislike, personally, leeching off someone else's success, well, I dislike it less than abject poverty.

"...This reminded me of something that baffled me.

When my Grandmother had a stroke 2 years ago, she spent a lot of time in the hospital. In the room next to hers, there was a MISERABLE old woman who screamed obscenities at the nurses, her friend, daughter, everything.

She had several kids who were still alive, but only the daughter came to talk to her. I caught my Mom saying on a number of occasions that it was ""so sad"" that only the one daughter came to visit her and tried to claim that the other children were terrible for leaving their mother in the hospital and not visit.

Like wtf? I'mk pretty fucking sure there's a reason they never fucking bothered to come. This is the same woman who screamed that a nurse should die because she brought the wrong fucking Jello for her supper by mistake."

"My mom kicked me out in January 2016, in the midst of my first year of law school. I was forced to sleep in my car for five months. I had no job when she kicked me out because I was a full-time law student and I was supposed to be able to live off of the tuition refund they give us every year for living expenses, especially since I put down that I was living at home on my FAFSA. I got a day job so I could afford to feed myself and pay my bills, but I started slipping in school. I went from doing amazing to barely understanding any of my course materials. Pretty soon, my professors caught on to the fact that I was sleeping in my car and the Dean ultimately asked me to withdraw temporarily until I could stabilize my situation.

The scariest part was having to sleep in public parking lots with my car in a dangerous city. My school is in the heart of a city that was once known as one of the most dangerous cities for violent crimes in America, but I always had to try to sleep close by to avoid being late to class (classes were at like 7 AM, it was awful). I have heard horror stories from friends. A friend of mine fell asleep in his car after a long night at the library, thinking it would be safer to rest before driving home. He ended up waking up to a guy banging on the window with a gun. He was carjacked and shot in  the leg twice. I was always terrified that this would happen to me. There are a ton of other homeless people and drug addicts, psychopaths, etc. just roaming the streets of this city. 

Once I temporarily withdrew from school to figure things out, I started sleeping in areas that I knew were safer, since I didn't have to commit to making school work while being homeless anymore.

Another scary thing about being out in the streets is the police. I was literally pulled from my vehicle, tested for alcohol and drugs, handcuffed and thrown into the back of a patrol car, and had my entire car torn apart with searches NINE TIMES IN FIVE MONTHS just because I was sleeping in my car and the cops had a quota to meet. I refused to have my car searched every time and demanded probable cause. Sometimes the cops were legit like ""It's just kinda weird that you look presentable but you're sleeping in your Dodge Charger claiming to be homeless. Are you under the influence?"" WHICH I UNDERSTOOD. Okay, cool. I'll comply to prove my innocence. But then there were a few times where the officers would claim some stupid shit like ""This place (that you know for a fact isn't connected with any break-ins whatsoever) is known for break-ins. The fact that you're out here is suspicious."" I was always afraid a cop would abuse his authority and arrest me and take my car - which was also my home at the time.

EDIT: My mom kicked me out after we argued and I stood up for myself instead of letting her belittle me in front of my siblings. I'm happy to report that everything is wonderful for me now! I'm back in law school and have a great job that pays the bills and works around my school schedule. I currently go half on rent at a beautiful apartment with my boyfriend. As for my mom and I, we are on great terms! I visit her and my siblings frequently and still do stuff with them. I secretly hope she's ashamed of herself for what she did to me, but I'm not holding any grudges. I know it sounds cliche, but this experience has only made me strong AF. "

Definitely not universal, in fact, I rarely encountered it in Japan \(outside of people repeating Japanese words in the katakana pronunciation of the English word\), but it happens.  I think the video is called でも、日本語で喋っている or something like that.

"Posting on behalf of my buddy, Ian, who doesn't do Reddit.

Ian bought a condo with his fiancee last year after being evicted from their apartment (not their fault).  Everything was great for a month.

Unfortunately, his fiancee broke her key in the lock one day.  Ian, wanting to be the handy man (which he should never do), tried to fix it himself.  He ended up fucking the lock up beyond repair after getting frustrated.  He replaced the entire entry assembly.

That's when his HOA threatened him with fines.  See, his new entry assembly *looked slightly different* than every other unit.  He matched the color, but the shape was off, and the door handle didn't look right.  They were threatening a $200 fine for every day he let it sit there.

He removed the assembly, but they stopped making the matching parts 50 years ago.  He did find one on eBay and was waiting for it to ship.  In the meantime, he was unable to lock his condo.

On *the day the lock arrived*, Ian came home and found out his ~~house~~ condo had been broken into.  All of his electronics were gone and his two dogs were left in the kitchen, dead, one with a knife left in its throat.

He's been fighting his HOA in court ever since."

"I am late to the party, but here you go.

When I was a teenager, I used to go out camping by myself. I had a spot where I liked that was across a few fences from my Grandparent's house in the middle of nowhere.

One of the places I cut through was a pasture full of cattle. Around cattle, especially cattle unfamiliar with me, I try to be very careful to not spook them but otherwise cows are pretty easy going. This was about a mile from my Grandparent's house and probably about two from my destination.

The one time I am thinking of(the last time), I slipped through the fence to find the cattle already freaked out. They were insanely agitated about something I was not aware of, so I stayed well clear of them as I went through the pasture.

I had a good time camping that night and packed up the next morning. As I went back into that pasture, however, there was this ridiculously bad smell. It smelled like a skunk had fought with something in a fertilizer barrel of shit and the barrel broke open. It was awful. I tried to look around for the cows to make sure they were not going to surprise me and I could not find them. They were just gone. There was some brush and trees, though, so I thought they were just out of sight.

I keep walking through the place to get home and the smell is so bad that I set down my stuff at the fence line and decide to investigate.

Well, I found the cows. All of them were shot and ripped apart. Someone had carefully shot them in the head with a bolt gun style thing(or hit them hard enough with a pointy object to bust through their skulls) and eviscerated all of them. They had also drug them all into a little shallow ravine and piled the bodies up. It was horrible.

I hightailed it out of there back to my gear. My stuff was gone. As in, I set it right here on this rock and it is not within eyeshot. A quick glance showed me there was not anything ripped or fallen out, so something(someone) had picked it up while I was 200 yards away for less than 5 minutes.

I think Usain Bolt would not have been able to catch me on the way home. I never heard anything else about those cows and I did not go back to the old camping spot again.

Second story.

Sorry, I generally prefer to rewrite these from memory, but I am on my phone right now and so this is a copied comment from before. I had to adjust some things referencing the question, so I hope it all works.

My cousin is with the forest service in the Montana/Wyoming area and I decided to go up there with her to literally test the waters. She does hydrology and has to ride out to the middle of nowhere to test streams and snow runoff to ensure no contaminants, so I thought that sounded fun and wanted to do a bit of a tour with her. We were going to have to camp out there for 2 nights, so we packed up all our gear in saddlebags or saddlebundles and started out.

The first day and night was amazing. Beautiful scenery and amazing air quality. It really is so peaceful out there. I love that area and wish I got to go up there more often.

Anyway, we started out on the second day and my cousin said, ""You want to see something weird?"" Of course I said yes, so she led me on a bit of a side journey into this tiny little ravine. We ended up traveling about 2 hours away from our actual path we had laid out.

At the very end of this fold in the land, she dismounts and tells me to get off my horse, too. We tie them up in this gorgeous little clearing and she tells me to follow this tiny wildlife path and bring our little rechargeable radio. It is one of those you can plug in or wind up, and it also acts as a lantern if you really need it to, but that kills the batteries quickly.

I do and, out in the middle of fucking nowhere, there is a huge coil of wire sticking out of the ground. The wire itself was not weirdly large, like some buried transmission wire, but small, like 10 or 12 gauge wiring for a house. It trailed off into the brush and trees, so naturally I decided to follow the damn thing out of curiosity.

My cousin trails behind me as I do, and this wire, after coming straight up from the ground, is strung across limbs of trees then back to the ground, then it snakes around rocks and finally deadends into an outlet. That outlet is mounted on the side of a desk. It looks like a schoolteachers desk from when I was growing up, with a metal base and a pseudo wood/plastic top thing. No chair, no building, no nothing, just this outlet and this desk. I am staring confused as all hell at this desk in the middle of a forest when my cousin takes the radio, pulls out the cord, and plugs it into the outlet. That fucker then lit up and started blaring static.

The wire was being fed from somewhere. Now, the place where we were had no road access, no buildings for many miles, and no other people around. And yet, there was a live outlet.

Weird as shit.

No spooky jumpscares or bodies, just one, lone powered desk in the middle of the woods. I wish I had taken a picture of it.

"So, a guy in my frat had walked onto the football team, but quit or scrubbed out after freshman year. He was still buddies with a bunch of football players tho.

Walkon was friends with this girl from his hometown who was also a student. She was moderately attractive - the freshman 15 had definitely done it's work, but she had huge tits that she always displayed prominently. She was also a big partier,  and had the reputation of being really easy. Several guys in my frat had slept with her, and people were always making fun of them, cause the rumor/joke/whatever was that she had STDs from getting gangbanged by Walkon's football buddies. But I always assumed that was just giving people shit.

So, I'm down in the college town over the summer, and me, Walkon, and another frat bro are hanging out one evening at a house Walkon was renting with some football buddies. We're drinking and playing cards, having decided we wouldn't go out that evening.

Girl and three football players show up. I knew Girl from her hanging around our frat parties, and kinda knew the football players through Walkon. They were all linemen (i.e. fat 300+ lb dudes). They had been at a bar nearby and had come over to do some coke.

So, they all start snorting coke, and we continue drinking. It was the summer and hot as hell. One of the football players cranks the music, and they proceed to strip down to their underwear and start dancing around.

Girl also strips down to her thong, and is dancing around, etc. It wasn't like a strip show or anything, but she was teasing people, rubbing her tits in people's facing, and kinda grinding on some of us that were sitting down.

Anyways, after a while one of the football players takes her to a bedroom. We start hearing sex noises, and laugh about it, but then a couple minutes later the other two football players head off to the room. Me and 2nd frat guy look at Walkon,  and he just kinda grins and throws up his hands. The rumors were true! 

So Walkon is like ""come on, let's check this out."" We go to the bedroom door. One of the football guys is laying on the bed, with Girl rocking on top of him. A second one is getting jerked off by her. And the third one is kinda standing in the corner, trying to jerk his dick, but looking like he's not having much success.

Walkon proceeds to drop his drowers. Me and the 2nd frat bro decide we don't need to see Girl get plowed by these 4 fat dudes, and proceed to the kitchen to continue drinking.

At some point the guy who was trying to get it up storms out of the room, yelling to high hell, and barges out the back door. Later a second football guy leaves the room, and stumbles to what I assume was his bedroom. 

Then Girl walks out to the kitchen, butt naked, grabs a bottle of booze and takes a big pull. Walkon comes out and said the 3rd football player passed out.

We drink some shots and whatnot, all the while with Girl just standing around butt naked. Eventually she says to me and 2nd frat bro something like ""So do you guys want a turn before I pass out?""

Given the likelihood of catching an STD, and the lurking discontent of having seen those 4 dudes naked, I politely decline (as does 2nd frat bro). So Walkon tells Girl he wants a second round, and they head to his bedroom, while we head home.

The End"

It was amazing, given how steep and icy it was. No one was hurt. Just kind of horrified, and wondering how the fuck we survived. "

"I got the ping around 4:30am. When I get to the address, I see this girl who looks startlingly like the actress that plays Ginny Weasley standing in the middle of the street waving, so I stop. Yup, she's my passenger... and she is *so drunk*. And carrying an enormous glass full of red wine. She asked if she could bring the wine in the car, I told her no because we'd both be arrested, she said okay, then I'll chug it. And she did.

Okay... so she gets in my car and I drive her maybe six blocks away to a friend's place. Her friend hands her a grocery bag of miscellaneous shit, she tells me to drive her home... or... wait... ugh I don't wanna go home, just drive around until I figure out where I want to go. Sure, free money, I start driving circles while she drunkenly calls everyone in her phone. Unsurprisingly, no one answers, and she *really* doesn't want to go home, so we just keep going in circles. I've reminded her at least three times that this is costing her money, I have no problem with it but are you absolutely sure? Yeah no problem, money doesn't matter right now.

The conversation is one of the more hilarious and utterly WEIRD I've experienced. Of course she's so drunk that her speech is entirely slurred and I can't make a lot of it out, but I get enough to know that she's not only drunk, but she's been doing pot and cocaine and she's on the longest bender of her life - currently day 8. She was recently fired from her job at a marijuana dispensary and is in the process of suing them for wrongful termination, her dad committed suicide when she was 4, she had like three friends die in various ways within the past few years, something about being in AA but falling off the wagon, her mom is SO RICH but doesn't want to give her second house to her own daughter WTF, she never wants to marry because she has yet to meet a dude who is not a horrible person (but she happily has sex with pretty much all of them), has been pregnant twice and contracted who knows how many STIs, really wants to work in forensics someday and start her own business, on and on and on! I don't mind listening, it's like having a prime time drama show unfold in my backseat that I'm getting paid to watch.

Around 5:45, after over an hour of driving, she said that there's a bar she knows that opens at 7am. If I'm okay with driving aimlessly until then (I assured her that I am!) I can take her there. So another hour and fifteen minutes of wandering later, I drop her off at the bar. She thanked me profusely, called me boo, and told me to have a good life.

And to top it all off, she tipped me with an entire container of marijuana edibles.

"The ""You won a TV / $5,000 / bass boat!"" scams at car dealerships.

Generally, you get a flyer in the mail that says ""scratch off x to see if you won!""

You always ""win"" the biggest prize but when you read the fine print, you actually only win the right to spin some wheel or put your name in a box for a drawing.

The employees' friends and family always actually get the boat / TV / cash. Your ""win"" is just a tactic to get you into the dealership.

A fun thing to do is waste the manager's time.

Go to the dealership, ""prize"" flyer in hand. Find an nice car. One with all of the options. Ask for every dealer add on they offer and tell them you don't want to waste time negotiating, you have cash. Talk to the manager, and keep going back to him/her. Insist on a test drive with the manager. Convince them you want to buy the car, and get to the paperwork phase. 

Then, just before you sign, inform them that they haven't sold you a car. They've sold you on the idea of buying a car. Get the manager's card and tell them you'll be dropping their card in a hat with other dealership manager's cards. A card will be selected at random and that dealership manager will be notified by mail in 4 to 6 weeks. Let them know that the actual car you buy may not be the one used in your ""promotion.""

"When negotiating with someone on the price of an item, if they know the real value and you don't, you will lose every time because you are drawing your perceived value from their negotiations.

Edit: The example I was thinking of was in dealing with jewelers in Mexico. They have a price on an item, you can negotiate on the price. But the problem is that they know the items true value (""true value"" meaning the reasonable price of the item on the wider market). They use a lot of tricks to bump your perceived value, high initial price, offering a special deep discount, pretending to have to go to the shops owner, pretending to be put out, etc. But at the end of the day, they know how much the item is actually worth, and you don't, so they will always win.

"Little late to the thread, but wanna share:

I went on a two and a half week long hike in the middle of nowhere Nevada. Like a couple of hours from even the smallest of towns. One night, I decided to set up camp on a ridge line overlooking a valley with a dirt road bisecting it.

Most nights I would've had a small fire, but it was breezy and was cutting across the ridge pretty hard. I think the weather saved my life. 

At about 10pm, a truck drove down the road and there was a rhythmic pattern of ""door opens, dome light comes on, driver grabs something from the passenger floorboard, drops it out of the truck, closes the door, drives slowly for 20 seconds, and repeats."" He did that for what looked like a mile. I thought it was weird, but whatever. 15 minutes later, a different vehicle, a suburban, drive up along the road. The driver was holding a flashlight out the window and stopped in the same spots the truck did. Open door. Pick up something. Close door. Drive. Open door. Pick up something. Drive. 

I don't know what the fuck it was, but I'm convinced that I would've ended up with a couple more bullets in me than I'd like, if I had that camp fire. "

"Medical bills that you don't owe. This year alone I've had probably had over 50k in bills sent to me that i didn't owe a penny on, my insurance had already gone back and forth with them and i owed 0 dollars but it didn't stop them from sending things to collections.

Any time you receive a medical bill check your explanation of benefits from your insurance to see what you truly owe, if they're billing you for a different number contact your insurer immediately.

If you live in a civilized nation where disabled people aren't harassed for fuck tons of money you can disregard this

edit: no joke the one hospital system has been doing it to me so much that I just wait until I receive all my bills from them at the end of the week and call my insurer.  This time cigna told me that what they were trying to do could be considered unlawful since I had already addressed this problem the max number of times they're supposed to be able to give you a hard time about it after you've sorted it out.  Like they did all the possible resolution steps, everything was paid in full, and they were STILL trying to bill me.  

edit edit: Man, I thought they were jerks to me.  Some of you who have been fighting for years are obviously familiar with this bullshit."

"I was talking to this girl at a club before, barely knew her. About an hour later in the night I was up dancing with a different girl, who had nothing to do with the 1st girl. I had to take a piss, so I started walking to the bathroom. Security grabbed me and said ""you are leaving, now"". I was like... wtf? What did I do? He was a big dude and kept pushing me towards the back door. He throws me out the back door where there were 5 cops waiting. The security guy said ""he was with them"". I had no clue what was going on. The police asked for my ID and everything. Luckily, the cops were cool about everything and said ""yeah that security guy is being a dick and throwing everyone out""

I went back around front to talk to people and figure out what the hell just happened. I guess the first girl I was talking to was caught doing coke in the bathroom. So just because I was talking to her for 5 minutes way earlier in the night, the security guy decided I was with her and needed to be kicked out."

"My mom was adopted in a closed adoption. When she was in her 20's the government decided to unseal all adoption records so she was able to find out a few things about her birth mother which eventually led to her finding her. 

I remember that my mother was excited to meet her. She didn't have a great relationship with her adoptive parents (or anyone, really) and I think she was really emotionally invested in having a relationship with her birth mother. 

After she found her they spoke on the phone and arranged to meet. I didn't get to go, but my mom talked about it non stop, showed me pictures, told me about their day together and was over the moon happy.  Then one day I just never heard anything else about it. She never went to see her again and I was really confused. My mom wouldn't talk about it.

A little while later I was in her room looking for something and found a letter addressed to her from her birth mother. It was like 12 pages long but the gist was that, while she was happy they met and had been curious about her for years, no- one in her life (including her Husband) knew she'd ever had a baby and she wanted to keep it that way. She asked my mother never to contact her again. 

My mom has a lot of problems. We never really got a long and haven't spoken in a couple of years.  I hate her for a lot of things, but thinking about that letter still makes me hurt for her. I remember just sitting there crying when I read it.  She's done some pretty horrible shit to me but I still feel sorry for her when I think about that. Wish I'd never seen it.    "

So, no lying, absolute honesty. Not having that kind of bullshit again as I was a fucking wreck after that all ended and I blamed myself for months thinking I could have done more or said something, when really he just didn't care and didn't care to tell me that, either."

"One night when I was 11 years old I was watching tv with my two older sisters (13 and 15 at the time). Our parents were out late at a party but being home alone was nothing new to us. Just before 1 am our dog stood up and left the family room, and began to stare out the back door of the kitchen, just off the family room. A minute later he went absolutely crazy. It was not the typical barking sound, or the growling at a stranger, cat, etc. It was an insane mixture of incredibly loud barking and wild animal growling, the sound one would make in a truly life or death situation.
This, of course, freaked the shit out of us. We went to our dog to comfort him and after 20 seconds of discussion of what the fuck was going on we decided we had better secure the house as quickly as possible. It was a large house with many doors and windows to check, we all ran frantically to lock up everything as quickly as possible. The last door I got to was the garage door. A split second after locking it I put my hand around the handle to verify it was locked, and felt someone from the other side viciously shaking the handle, pushing trying to open the door. We of course made quite a few phone calls within the next few minutes.
The memory of feeling that violent shaking, knowing the person my dog freaked out about, was 1 foot from me on the other side creeps the shit out of me even now.

"As for my sister, she lost the house not long after we left as well and she, her husband, and their four kids were living out of their SUV. They hadn't paid anything in months because it was all going to her drug habit. My parents had called CPS on them simultaneously as this was going on, and my parents were granted temporary custody. This made the motel especially necessary as my parents had to provide some sort of home for the kids while all of this was going on. The case workers were well aware of our current living situation. They effortlessly won custody, they eventually were able to save up for the down payment on an apartment. My sister and her husband split. No idea what he's been up to, don't care. He was an ass and an alcoholic. My sister is still a crackhead. Just recently got out of jail for being arrested for possession. She birthed another round of kids, 3, and lost custody of those kids 3 months ago. She and my mom are not on speaking terms despite years trying to reconcile their issues after what she did (she did more than just steal money - she pawned irreplaceable values like our grandmother's wedding ring)."

There are laws that state cremated remains have to be ground up into powder because the sight of actual bones is too disturbing. I understand it's uncomfortable and it's sad, but society in the west has distanced themselves as far away from death as possible and I'm convinced that's the cause of our severe fear of it.

"Extra life insurance as an ""investment.""

Many financial advisers will advise buying more life insurance than you need because holding the policies allow a certain amount of tax-free investing - and yes, what they say is true to a degree.

But, you're also then paying for extra coverage that you don't need (hopefully) in order to ""buy"" the right to these tax-free earnings so all up you're likely out money (yes, you now own the insurance policy but given that the idea is to improve your portfolio and not your safety net, it may not be a smart strategy.)

At any rate, they do this because it makes them an immediate commission to sell the policy as opposed to earning money slowly by helping you grow your portfolio.

Long story short...many years ago a buddy got a job as a financial adviser and I went in for a ""financial review"" to help him out since he needed clients - his mentor sold me on a bunch of shit on how additional insurance would help me and then I bought it - fast forward 3 years, Jon quits and I get a call from a dude at the firm asking me to come in as he's the new adviser.

Basically he explains that we need to drop all of this excess insurance and that shady advisers oversell this tax advantage for more than it is in order to get the commissions.

For the record, this comment is not meant to say ""don't buy life insurance"" but that you should be careful buying extra life insurance policies as a financial instrument to invest - especially if the person selling you on this idea works for the company selling the policies....but DO buy enough life insurance to protect your family, not as an investment but as, well, insurance."

"To give you a better answer...


The man and his friend are the survivors of a small plane crash. The plane crashed on a deserted island. There were 3 men on the plane, the man, the friend, and the pilot, a friend of both men. The pilot was killed in the crash. The man was blinded in the crash. The plane had no survival supplies and the men were going to be stranded for a while. After a day of hunting, the friend comes to the blinded man and gives him ""albatross"". The blind man enjoys it, and both men survive on the ""albatross"" until rescue comes. 

When the blind man arrives at the restaurant, he is informed that the special of the day is Albatross. Having had and enjoyed it before, the blind man orders it. Upon receiving his plate and tasting it, the man realizes that what he was eating on the island wasn't Albatross, but the pilot. The man cannot live with himself, having eaten his friend. He then kills himself."

"Last year. 

I was walking down the street kind of not really paying attention when someone grabs me by the collars, scares the shit out of me. This is broad daylight on a crowded street, to give it some context. 

It's this woman, obviously fucked up on something, and she says, ""where's the bridge?""

I still haven't quite caught up with processing the situation yet, so I just go ""what?""

Then she screams in my face, ""JUST TELL ME WHERE THE BRIDGE IS I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL MYSELF.""

Still not sure what the protocol for this situation is, I just say, ""I'm not gonna help you with that."" And this apparently was enough to make her let go. Then she grabs some other passer-by and starts the process again, so I whip my phone out and call 911. They ask a bunch of questions about where we are, what she looks like, if I think she's on anything and so on. While I'm doing this she gives up on the bridge idea and decides to walk into traffic.

Luckily it's rush hour so nothing's moving. She gets honked at a lot but that's pretty much it. And there must have been a police car nearby already, cause one showed up in about 30 seconds. She was on the other side of the street at this point so I couldn't hear them, but the cops talked to her for a while and then she got in the car and they left.

Then the police called me back about 2 hours later and told me that she'd been processed and went to a mental health place to get help. I didn't know the cops called you back and have updates, so that was nice I thought. I never heard anything about her after that though so hopefully things turned out okay for her."

I remember reading an article about children drowning, and how a staggering percentage of children who drown do so within metres of an adult; the adults just don't notice that they're in trouble. The stereotypical 'drowning person' image is one of someone frantically waving and splashing and screaming, whereas the danger is that once you're actually drowning, you go silent and it's a lot less noticeable."

The alleged cripple then proceeded to smash the cast against the sink, breaking it open and spilling close to 50 ecstasy tabs all over the ground in individual baggies. Turns out the cast was a makeshift paper mache (however you spell that French ass word) cast he had made himself. Genius.

"Park Chung Hee, the 3rd President of South Korea. He was a military dictator who came to power by leading a military coup against his president, who was admittedly but a mere figurehead.

He was an oppressive sack of shit who crushed any form of competition against him who ruled by pushing through laws to let him stay in power longer, and when it was clear his government was acting against him, dissolved the National Assembly which he had made to ensure absolute obedience.

His rule was finally stopped when the head of the Secret Police he'd made, the Korean version of the CIA, shot him in the middle of a meeting where the man was busy crushing a student protest and complaining how the KCIA wasn't arresting/killing everyone in the opposition.

He was also responsible for transforming Korea from a poor, agrarian society to a modern economic powerhouse. He did this by pimping out his soldiers to Vietnam in exchange for American money, normalized diplomatic relations with Japan, a country he despised, and created a series of economic policies no one could stop because he would arrest anyone trying to hinder his plans.

To this day, people still argue if he should be considered good or evil due to how effective he was despite his many human rights violations. His memory is so prevalent that the current South Korean President is actually this guy's daughter."

Later, the police came and asked me about the student with the student present. I told them what he had said, and the student said, ""No I told him it was N-Ethyl-1-propanamine! He's a moron.""

The police never caught him for anything so he's now an attorney working for the DOJ, but I failed him on his final paper which didn't affect anything since he dropped the class through the dean's office by claiming that I was ""racially subversive"" and ""perjured myself in front of law enforcement by making outlandish, false and damaging statements.""

"This might be a little more abstract than some others, but- a couple gallons of gas in my car on a particular day.

When I was in high school I had an abusive boyfriend, whom I was terrified to break up with. I was really close with a few of his friends and we hung out as a group often. One night, I wanted to watch The Omen -- the original one, just before the 2006 one came out -- and he didn't want to. One of his/my friends went ""hey CHlMlCHANGAS, want to go watch it at my place?"" so we went with 1 of the other friends, but I had only had enough gas to get home and I had no money. So my friend spotted me $5 so I could get to his house, and then home later.

After the movie finished, those 2 friends had a conversation with me about the boyfriend. They knew he was beating me even though I had never said anything. And they told me that if I wanted to get out, they would help. And they did. And now, 11 years later, I'm engaged to one of them.

I'd say that $5 of gas changed my life."

"I spent 30 years doing computer systems work and had some pretty high paying positions, as well as achieving a pretty high degree of personal and professional success.  

My wife mostly babysat during the time our kids were growing up then had a pretty good career with the government although she never got very high, not starting till she was over 40.

She did express some jealousy on occasion at how ""smart"" I was and how well I was doing but I never, ever made that an issue.  We're a team, she took care of the kids, I brought in the moola.  

I've heard of people who think marriages are supposed to be 50/50 but that is so much bullshit, it's not even technically possible.  Marriage is no a contest, like I said, it's a partnership, two people working toward a common goal.  Sometimes you give more, something they give more, it's not worth worrying about."
"Darkest of dark nights in the Vietnam jungle. Low, invisible cloud cover blocked out all possibility of light from the sky, no city lights. 

It was dark enough for a military wristwatch with a luminous dial to glow like a streetlight ten meters from me. Dark enough that I noticed the ground was glowing pale yellow green all around me. Eerie. Astoundingly beautiful.

I think there was phosphorous in the soil. The glow was coming from bits of dead leaves on the ground - no glow from live plants. I saw a beetle who evidently liked dead leaves - he was all lit up. Then a disco-millipede, brightly lit by the phosphorous he'd consumed.

Was *very* strange and surreal. I had some stuff to think about that night, so this unexpected light show was confusing, almost a sign from the war gods, if I could only figure it out.

I finally decided that it was beautiful. That was all I got out of it. The meaning (for me, anyway) came much later. I wrote about it a couple of years ago on reddit.

"I had one coworker who was angry that I got assigned to run a project that she applied for (note: I was assigned, despite the fact that she applied and I didn't). She was so pissed off about it that she created a spreadsheet to document the exact times I came into work and every time that I left my desk and came back so then she could ""get me in trouble with my boss"". She did this for two months, and then brought the ""evidence"" that I'd been showing up to work between 8:15 and 8:30am instead of 8am, and was taking breaks closer to 20 minutes than 10. 

My boss laughed her out the door- we had an agreement that I could show up when I felt like it and could take the break lengths I wanted since she knew I was working a minimum of 60 hours a week and would be there way past 5pm even if I took no breaks. Partially because I had to pick up the slack of the other employees, partially because we got so many contracts in at once, that they were willing to give me what I wanted to get it completed. You probably shouldn't create your own project to get another employee in trouble when you have no idea what their situation is AND you didn't get the project you wanted to run because you already waste too much time at work and can't be trusted to stay on task or use fair judgment regarding fellow employee roles.

2 red flags stood out - he was slightly irritated to learn I was in my 30's even though he was 40.  As in was irritated I was not younger (I look much younger than I am).  Not angry irritated but you could tell he was slightly disappointed.

Then when I mentioned how I used to be incredibly gullible and naive he took quite an interest in that.  To much of an interest.

So that night after I got home I googled him but couldn't find anything.  Talked to my upstairs neighbor about him and showed her a picture.  Lucky for me she knew who he was because he went to school with her ex-husband. 

Turns out I couldn't find him because he gave me a fake last name.  Looked him up using the correct name and what I found made me sick to my stomach.

Not only was he almost 10 years older than what he told me but he he also had 1 conviction and 2 arrests for gross sexual imposition of a minor.  Read the documents and their physical description matched mine to a T (hair type, body type, ect).  

Noped out of that situation really fucking quick and told him never to contact me again.  To his credit he never did.

Within a year or so I had paid off the bills and started watching my bank account grow and grow.  It became a game for me and I still kept living like a pauper.

"Man, this reminds me of the weird experience my wife had in getting a quote to clear an overgrown area on the property she manages (it's an event venue for rent). 

There's a ~100 meter stretch of shoreline on a small lake nearby that had gotten overgrown with bushes, small trees, whatnot. She asked 3 landscaping companies for quotes. Their bids:

-One said $7,000

-One said $15,000

-One said ""nah, we won't/can't.""

Her elderly coworker was apoplectic and convinced that the last time it was done, they didn't pay more than $2,000. Conveniently, however, she couldn't remember the name of that company and couldn't find any paperwork from when it was done. 

Out of the blue, a business card from a landscaper appeared in our house's front door. She called the guy and asked if he could clear the business's shoreline. Turns out he was the same guy that did it before and did it the next day for $1500. The job was literally just cutting and clearing out all the growth. "

"Thanks!  I don't know why but this is something I end up doing fairly often.  Just a couple months ago when I was coming back to work from lunch I noticed a pigeon hopping around on one foot with a wing that didn't look right.  It took me about 30 minutes but I finally was able to pick him up from under a car where he was hiding.  Turned out he had a broken leg and a broken wing - rough shape, and would have died.  Again, wrapped him up in my shirt and put him in a box.  Then I went online and found an organization called the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors.  They arranged for one of their volunteers to come pick the bird up from me at my office and get it to a vet who moonlights in bird rehabilitation.  I never found out what happened but I am hoping the pigeon made it.  

The one that sticks with me the most is when I saw a big turtle on the side of the road.  This was maybe 12 years ago.  When I say big -  I mean easily 2 feet long, 1.5 feet wide or so.  Someone had run him over and his shell was cracked very badly and he was bleeding.  From what I understand this is extremely painful for turtles, and that was apparent in his behavior.  In this instance I called animal control but was advised not to move the turtle for fear of making the situation worse.  Instead I just kept my car parked behind him to prevent any other cars from running him over and I just sat there to keep him company.  It took about an hour before anyone came out but once they arrived I was assured he would be taken care of.  I guess they can repair the damaged shell but I never found out for sure what happened.  I can still see his face in my mind."

Oh there was also the time they had me run around and buy 25 dollar gift certificates for their annual company Christmas party from 25 different places... in Las Vegas... two days before Christmas. That was fun. 

Edit: woke up to questions about Monster drinks going bad. They maybe didn't ""go bad"" but they had a drink by/expiration date. The kid never went to their house enough to drink them all or even put a dent in the stash. They just tossed them and bought more. "

Also, my insurance is top notch (got thwacked with an under-inflated volleyball in the nose and had no hesitation in getting it checked out with a CT Scan. Cost me $13 after 2 doctors appointments, CT scan, and antibiotics for the sinus infection caused by the bleeding).

As a result of this (and after giving a couple months notice), I booked a 2 week vacation to Southeast Asia earlier today.

"Me and my BF lived in an apartment, we were on the 3rd floor. The mudroom/closet area right by the door was where we kept the cat's litter box. Now, most people can tell you that unless its right after your cat uses the box, it doesn't smell like shit, usually just the cat litter smell. (clay, febreeze, whatever) So for about a week I noticed it smelled like shit. I tore the area and the rest of the apartment apart looking for rogue turds but to no avail. 

I went to leave for a week long solo trip, and noticed the smell of feces was in the hall. At this point I was like 'Great. some one else has the poop problem. Not me!' And went on my merry way.

In the middle of the trip, I get a call from my boyfriend. He told me the smell in the hall was unbearable so he called the landlord on his way out to get some take-out food. He comes back with his food, the maintenance man had tracked the smell to an apartment below us. He asked my boyfriend to be a witness to him breaking the door down. He broke the door down, and there was the tenant, had been dead for weeks, sitting on their couch. One of the worst parts is that there were other apartments closer to theirs, and yet we (the floor above) were the only ones who reported the smell weeks later. This wasn't even the first time that happened in our building, but for some reason this  time really freaked me out."

"In the mid 90's I was installing network cards for dorms connected to the brand new 10/100 switched network (super fast upgrade over the old 10Base2 network) (EDIT: I worked for a university).

Anyway, I walk into a dorm to assist a really lovely, really nice girl. Got her connected, got the Novell Client32 software installed, got her connected to the mapped drives. She kept scooting closer and closer, and she smelled wonderful.

A few minutes later her roomie strolls in from the shower, looks at me and then her, and then drops the bathrobe and starts strolling around in the nude, with me desperately trying to be professional and NOT look. Her friend, sitting next to me so close that our legs were touching, just shakes her head and pats me on knee (I was wearing shorts), then leaves her hand there. A few minutes later she stands up, faces me, unbuttons blouse and removes bra, then only buttons ONE button on blouse. ONE. BUTTON. In that instant she was so much sexier than the fully nude roomie, which is what I told her.
She said that I was sweet, gave me a $50 tip, then said her boyfriend was going to be there any minute. I was too confused to tell her I couldn't take a tip, and when I turned around after exiting her room, she took her blouse completely off, blew me a kiss, then closed the door. I was very confused, and had trouble walking out (it was uncomfortable in my pants, and to be honest, my heart felt like it was going to explode).

I only ever saw her once more a couple of months later, but didn't think she would recognize me so I didn't say anything. I was at the local pizza parlor, a couple of places in line behind her. When it was my turn to order, the girl behind the counter said that my meal was already paid for.

"During the summer while I was on vacation from college, I helped my mom at her first landscaping/greenhouse job. We went to this particular lady's house in the rich part of town, big Antebellum home, she was a realtor and all that jazz. We called her Dragon Lady because a) she looked like a wrinkly old Dragon and b) she hoarded the most ridiculous jewelry and always wore it. Even in her ""pajamas"".

We were taking a job to fix up (replace nice shrubs and flowers that she was just tired of) her back yard. She was a terrible excuse of a human. Mean spirited, snide comments, the works. But she had an inordinate amount of fresh young men always in and out of her house. Like the entire time we were there. Quite the variety. And if we ran into one she always introduced them as her ""cousins"" and we were like yeah ok sure you old crusty bag. 

She would flounce around in sheer robes with little to cover anything underneath. The guys followed her around the house like they were on a leash, it was like she WANTED us to see her because she was always in her sun room being doted on by her ""cousins"". Putting lotion on her reptilian skin, bringing her drinks, food, etc. 

Then when she was done with them a slick nice Mercedes would pick them up. We only witnessed the car a couple times but man she was weird. And gross. She's probably a fossil by now I guess. She was a relic then and that was only like 7 years ago. "

One night when I was about 11 or so I was staying with my dad, who's a total slob and his apartment was a mess. I poured myself a glass of V8 juice, which is pretty much a vegetable smoothie (very thick) then had a sip and went to bed, leaving it on a low coffee table where it stayed for the night.
When I woke up the next day sometime around noon it was really hot, so when I waddled into the lounge room]I went straight for the juice.
It was a little warm and a film had gathered on top of it, but after removing that layer it was okay... At least until a large piece of really tough 'vegetable matter' was sucked into my mouth. I bit it in half, thoughtlessly letting one part drop back into the cup and then proceeded to crunch into it. Immediately I realised that something was wrong and spat out the severed upper body (crushed skull and all) of a motherfucking mouse, coated in warm vegetable goo, which must've drowned that night.
I didn't vomit but felt sick for a good while afterwards... It still makes me gag thinking/writing about it. Ugh.

"Probably a lot better now than it used to be but The NYC Health Department is basically a racket.

They will count individual fruit flies. Go ahead and try that yourself some time.

There are too many things to list, and it's luck of the draw with inspectors. Some of them know that some things are unavoidable or not really a big deal and they'll give you a warning. Some will ticket every single thing they can.

If you ever see a ""grade pending"" letter it means owners were not okay with the grade they got. Then they wind up with an A or B no matter what and it's from paying fines.

Outrageous fines. Thousands of dollars if you make it down to a B. You have to provide pictures that you ""fixed"" an issue and they will come back in the next 6 months to check that you're keeping up on it but it's really just ""pay for an A.""

Source: worked in NYC kitchens for 6 years.

EDIT: I also have an NYC food handler's permit. Basically required as someone who works the line, in prep, or as a bartender. If you ever see a B at a bar that doesn't serve food it's more likely the bartender doesn't have their food handler's permit rather than improperly stored fruit/garnishes. It's an immediate 8 points(I think) if nobody on the premises has the permit. IIRC 14 points puts you at a B so if you throw in a couple bad lowboy(refrigerator) seals or a sticky cap for the quick pour liquor thingers and/or they counted 6 fruit flies, whelp, there ya go.

EDIT 2: I'd also like to mention there are some rules that are just not realistic. Keep hot food hot and cold food cold, but if you're cooling something that just came out of the oven it needs to reach 40 degrees F in x amount of time. Sometimes it's just impossible, and also impossible to enforce. I can just lie and say ""oh yeah, that came out of the oven 15 minutes ago."" No ticket. Not to mention those jagoffs expect a label for each individual pizza in the window with the time and temperature it came out, and it's supposed to be thrown away if not sold in 4 hours. Brah, I eat 3 day old pizza on a regular basis that was on the counter for 5 hours, didn't get home for another 2, then refrigerated for an additional 48-72 hours. With pork on it. Never have I once gotten sick. Once I learned how to properly handle food the people in my life quickly learned that just because ""it's only good for this long"" rules are about 60% bull and 25% cautionary due to the assumption of unsafe practices or transport time. I've worked in Malaysian food, pizzerias, american whatever food, blah blah blah. Trust me, the majority of kitchens really do care, and the ones that didn't were pretty obvious by the low quality. I never stayed long at those.

EDIT 3: For all of the complete tools commenting on people with weakened immune systems who can't eat old pizza my point stands that 4 hours is an arbitrary number. You don't get sick from pizza automatically after 4.5, 5, or 6 hours. I regularly discarded pizza that was past it's prime but the fact remains IF YOU HAVE A POOR IMMUNE SYSTEM, DO NOT EAT FOOD OUT OF AN OPEN DISPLAY CASE. I was not serving anyone day old pizza. This was also ONE of several jobs that I had in NYC kitchens. The fact that I have to argue this point is mind blowing. No, not everyone has the immune system of a healthy 27 year old man. Those people need to take personal responsibility in situations like this, pizza in a display case is not made to order. Or just ask ""what came out most recently."" Jesus, some people argue about the dumbest things."
"One time while driving in DC it got pretty weird at around 2 am.  They dropped the pin in the wrong location, so when I show up and don't see them, I give them a ring.  When the guy picked up, he just kinda starts yelling, but it sounded like he had some type of severe form of autism.  I wasn't mad though, I was just trying to help him out, but I really couldn't understand what in the hell he was trying to say, he seemed to do fine when texting though, so I just texted him to send me a message with his new address.  About 10 minutes later after going back in forth I finally get him.  Turns out I had a 2 Deaf customers, guy and girl, and I gotta say they were both pretty attractive.  I had heard a deaf person talk before, so I think I can safely say that he hadn't quite mastered it.  Here's the fun weird part.  About 2 or three minutes in, I see them signing at each other, and I mean like hard mode full speed.  It looked like a two of the most OG gang members were having a sign language rap battle.  Then almost in an instant, they stopped, and did what can only be described as sexually assaulting the others face.  It was a damn battle field, the guy and girl are both moaning these LOUD, COARSE, almost inhuman noises, and I'm just driving in pure awe.  But it was getting really weird, really fast, especially because they both kept on slightly looking at me or gesturing towards me.  So I did the only thing I could do, turned the music all the way up.  You see, I have a really good sound system, and usually only the people at night allow me to turn up it, I usually ask, but fuck it, they're deaf, and they were very preoccupied.  The best and worst part was that I think the bass was turning them on or something, because those two got even louder.  Finally we arrived, they gave me a good tip, and the girl gave me a kiss on the cheek, and that was it.  I can only imagine how those neighbors feel when they're going at it.

"Using a throwaway because this is definitely one of the shittiest things I've ever done. 

So I had ligament reconstruction surgery aka ""Tommy John surgery"" when I was fourteen. It's pretty unusual for someone as young as have that procedure. When it does happen, it's almost always on account of a sports related injury. And that's what my parents thought caused it. But that was not the case.

It started when we got cable in our home for the first time. This was a big deal. We didn't really have much in the way of entertainment at the time. I mean, we didn't even have internet. So I had to get creative when I wanted to crack off a round. One time for instance, I rubbed one out to a ham sandwich because I had guessed (correctly as it turned out) that that's what vaginas looked like. The sudden availability of a whole new world of television programming excited me in a way that makes me question things even to this day.

Yet all that excitement turned to bitter disappointment after I discovered we would not be receiving any premium channels (HBO, Showtime, etc). That meant no real nudity. Like, what's the point of having cable if you didn't get to see some boobs? It's like eating a ham sandwich but with no mayo. Sure, basic cable programs like Kiana's Flex Appeal on ESPN and the ""Wild On"" series on E! featured a fair amount of mammaries, but they were concealed and only served to further my lust for naked breasts.

One day, however, the gods smiled upon me. You see, the premium cable networks would sometimes 
 run ""free view"" weekends to give the plebs with basic cable a chance to see what they were missing out on. As luck would have it, my parents were going to something called a ""key party"" during one such promotion (I think it's the where everyone takes turns driving each other's car). Since they usually didn't return from those parties until late the next morning, I figured I had about twelve hours of uninterrupted spank time ahead of me. Not wanting to waste such a gift, I set about beating my dick like an unwanted ginger stepchild almost before they were even out the door.

Things went well enough for the first several hours. I hydrated, I replenished my electrolytes, I remembered to breath. Made sure I had a couple of ham sandwiches close by, too, so as to keep my energy levels up. Even perfectly spaced out the amyl nitrates I'd borrowed from mom and dad so I didn't become overly dilated. Everything was running like cockwork. It wouldn't be enough to stave off disaster.

My life changed at approximately two o'clock the following morning. It was during a movie starring Shannon Whirry. I'm not sure what it was about. I'd turned the sound off hours earlier and had chosen to fill my ear holes with the dulcimer sounds coming from a Gordon Lightfoot 8-track instead. Shannon's acting transcended the need for dialogue, though. I felt the conviction of her performance deep down in my plums. That, coupled with Gordon's vocals soaring on ""The Wreck of the Edmond Fitzgerald"" caused an involuntary surge of adrenaline to course though my veins. That was all it took to throw off my timing.

Whilst in the throes of climax, I failed to properly execute a downstroke and pulled back too early. It fappened so fast, there weren't nothing I could do about it. There was a pop and twinge in my elbow. Before I knew it, my arm was flopping around like a turkey giblet. I didn't know it at the time but, even as I was finishing, my days of high performance self abuse were finished. 

When my parents returned to find me writhing on the living room floor sans underoos and in a puddle of my own making, they immediately took me to the hospital to get it looked at. Actually, they had a long shower together first. But then they took me straight to the ER. The only stops they made were to picm up some Gatorade from a convenience store on the way and then some more Gatorade at a different convenience store in the opposite direction (didn't have mom's flavor at the first one). But then we went directly to the hospital right after getting a donut from Dunkin Dognuts and my parents having the obligatory argument over why mother chose the cream pie.

At the hospital, I was examined, poked, and prodded quite thoroughly (no HMO). When the results came back, we are all relieved to learn that both my mouth and my butthole were the same exact temperature. This is why you always insist on having your temperature taken rectally as well as orally. Does it cost more? Not if they only use one thermometer.

The other big news was that I had torn the ulnar collateral ligament in my elbow and would require surgery. A month later, I underwent the Tommy John procedure. Insurance paid for a lot of it, but the remaining bill was still several thousand dollars. My parents ended up using the funds they had earmarked for an above ground pool, trip to Disneyworld, and braces for our goat to fix me instead.

Usually, the recovery period for such this operation is around a year to a year and a half, after which the patient generally comes back as strong - sometimes even stronger - than before. My case was different, however. I had simply put too much torque into my stroking motion. My elbow would never be the same again. My ligament replacement surgery ended up being for quality of life porpoises only. 

But while I would never be able to strangle my dong, churn butter, or even milk goats at the level at which I had grown accustomed, I would at least be able to do basic things, like toss in a lipper or use a rotary telephone. More complex tasks, like wiping my own rear-end, were well nigh impossible for many years afterward. 

Fortunately, my parents hired a girl for that. Well, they didn't exactly pay her. But they did give her free lodging in our basement. Unfortunately for my bottom, she was only allowed upstairs once a week. Didn't speak much, but boy did she cry a lot. She disappeared one day. It sucked, but it did force me to learn to wipe lefty. A true blessing in disguise as it would turn out. The answer to my masturbation woes had been in my hand all along, just the other one. And for those times when I'm going at it especially hard and fast? A quick glance at the scar on my right elbow is all it takes to remind me to slow the heck down.

The silver lining in this whole fiasco was that I ended up in the history books for being the youngest non-athlete ever to receive Tommy John surgery (not counting test orphans). Even now, surgical residents from all over the United States, as well as America, read about me (they don't use my real name obviously). I'd like to think that the pain I felt that day has prevented a similar suffering in others. Some call me a hero. I don't. The real heroes are the brave men and women who put on that uniform every day, go out on the tennis field or the football court and just give it a 110%."

I hunt a lot. My father has property in South Texas and I love going out there alone to spend a weekend and hunt. One weekend it was like mid November and pretty chilly out. I decided I would head to my blind around late after noon and stay there through the night. When I arrived to the blind I hadn't seen any animals on the way at all and we are talking a good 2 miles of walking and not seeing any birds or rabbits or anything. I didn't think anything of it since it was winter of course but you still see some birds... as I arrived to the blind I was setting everything up and pulled out this bottle of doe urine to try and lure a buck with. The moment I opened it I started hearing movement on this ridge back behind the blind and kept trying to look out the small windows and see if I could see anything. All of a sudden this loud thud hit the side of the blind. I jumped and thought maybe a deer had fallen off the ridge and hit the blind. I couldn't see anything so I opened the door and saw a huge rock and a nice dent in the side of the blind. Someone or something threw this rock which had to have weighed close to 30lbs. I grabbed my rifle and said fuck this most likely out loud threw open the blind door jumped the 6 or 7 feet to the ground and started running back to camp. Nothing else happened other than the fact that that night I didn't hear any coyottes yelping and howling at all which you always hear out there. I got in my truck and left the next morning because I didn't feel like getting stabbed by some junkie or attacked by no Bigfoot. Have only gone out there a few times over the last couple of years and never had another incident. Don't go often due to wild hogs infesting the area. Sorry for it being a jumbled mess I am at work on my phone.

Then you just watch it fall apart piece by piece, month after month, year after year, until it is just gone, like it was never there before.

See, before we all had digital cameras embedded in our phones, we used to have to get our film developed.  You'd go out and buy a roll of film and it came in in dozens.  12 or 24 or 36 exposures.  You took all the pictures then took it to get the photos developed.

And they'd even develop the bad ones.  That picture of your thumb or that badly framed portrait would come back as part of your package of holiday snaps.

So when my future ex wife came back from her trip to Vegas and showed me her pictures, there was something not quite right.  After she left the room I thumbed through the photos again, but this time I counted them.  There were 17.  

Eventually I found the missing photos.  Pictures of her and her new boyfriend.  Nothing graphic, but enough to tell me our marriage was over."

"I was interested in learning about Wicca, because I was young and in highschool. Early 2000's. When Harry Potter was still happening and all that stuff. My mom and step dad found out by reading an email I sent to my cousin. It was the summer and they freaked out. Took everything. I couldn't read, I couldn't listen to music, I couldn't watch TV or movies with the family, I couldn't hang out with friends, couldn't talk to my cousin anymore, basically anything that might bring me pleasure was taken. They made me do chores all day, would go on family outings without me. Soon I became a shell of a person. I was going to kill myself, I wanted to I just was scared of death so I decided not to go through with it. So I turned myself off. 

They hated it. They weren't getting a rise out of me anymore, anything they said to me, to extending my sentence I wouldn't react to. Since thier narcissism relied on a victim, I wasnt a source anymore. So they extended my grounding even further. They could have told me to go pick up dog shit in the backyard with my teeth and I wouldn't have flinched. 

My step dad's family (just as terrible) would come over and belittle me as well. I was told to ""smile"". So I'd humor then and flash an empty smile for a second and return to my blank expression I had to find solace in. 

All this to ""save me from going to hell"" the only thing that saved me that summer was my visitation with my dad. My mom and step dad tried to paint him in a bad light like hr was the abusive one. Even as a kid I knew my dad didn't make me feel as bad and empty as they did. I eventually got through it. 

Years later, (about 4 years ago now) I ended up working at a job (unexpectedly) with a girl I used to play with in the neighborhood. I always wondered why she stopped showing up. When I wasnt home, or in another part of the house, she came to the door and asked to play. One of my parents opened the door and told her I didn't want to play with her anymore. 

I always wondered why she never hung out with me, or talked to me. Even finding this out in a more recent term, I cried and apologized to her. 

I could have had a great friendship. With a lot of people but they just wanted to alienate and control me. 

Unfortunately this is just the tip of the iceberg. 
I don't talk to them anymore, but I still llive in the same city as them and I have a lot of social anxiety because of that. One of my roommates, exhibits some of the behavior my parents were so kind as to bestow on me. It's making things difficult to handle. 

I just want people to be happy and live in a healthy environment. It's so fucked up that the biggest monsters in the world are the people closest to you.

Pitch black room, no shoes. I took one step and cut my foot to the bone. I then tracked blood all down the hallway and to the living room where my mom sat. She was so mad!"

"I know this, but it came at a very awkward time for me. As soon as I graduated from university, I wanted to get a job. Unfortunately, just before I had the opportunity, my disability benefits (I need assistance with travel due to severe refractory epilepsy) were cancelled (thanks UK government for that...) and my life hit a standstill. My old lecturers even contacted me recommending that I return for a PhD. I was heartbroken to have to turn it down. I'm not meant to be living like a schoolboy with my parents at 27, but that's the case at the moment. I might not be competing with my dentist, but it did rub my troubles in my face a little. When the benefits ordeal is resolved, and it should be in the coming months, I'll try and actually do something again.

In fact, that visit to the dentist was to get fillings due to a seizure injury (chipped two teeth after fainting and hitting my face on the edge of a bathroom sink... while brushing my teeth)! Typical."
"You figure that somewhere, at sometime, there's been someone who's just about to get laid (perhaps for the first time even!) and right before they go about getting some afternoon delight, the excitement causes them to collapse and die of a heart attack. So close, yet so far. "

"At least at my school, they would pull the bullshit of making the program so structured that you had to take classes with professors from my school who would just spend the semester abroad with us, so they could charge us full tuition for my school.  And it was very hard to work with our study abroad office to do a direct exchange (basically a ""plan it yourself and pick whatever university abroad you want"" situation) because they would make it virtually impossible to transfer any credits that way."

"We were thoroughly enjoying ourselves on the couch downstairs when we began to hear little squeaking noises. I was positioned so that I could see over the couch and realized that my cat was throwing a mouse around. In the house. The freak out overcame the power of sex, unfortunately.

"Cloud Atlas for me. Suddenly I could feel an unfathomable timeline stretching behind and ahead of me, with lifetimes of fights and innovations all along it. ""You are a mere drop in the bucket!"" ""What is the ocean but a myriad of drops?"" That line killed me.

It also killed me when the composer was writing to his ex-lover about a book he was reading, in which the last half of the book is torn out. ""After all, what is a half-finished book but a half-finished love affair?"" The composer writes and then as he leaves the room during a crucial moment, the camera pans down to the other half of the book under one leg of the bed, making it level.

"The most bizarre was this newly rich young family in Vienna. The bed time routine for the kids (aged 3 and 7) included basically a spa treatment for both. I haven't seen that amount of products in a child's bathroom (they each had their own) in my life. The poor 7 year old girl had next to no hair on her head but I was required to slather her in the most expensive adult shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, hair oil, and some other things I didn't recognise - every night. 

They only had one tiny box of toys and time spent playing was set up for 30 minutes after they brushed their teeth. Dinner was normally a bland fish fillet and a ton of salad. Not a grain of sugar anywhere in the house. Hot cocoa was made with skim milk and pure high quality cocoa - no sweetness to it whatsoever, it tasted awful. 

They had time to explain EVERYTHING to me the first time I was there and I received an inch thick file with lists and procedures to follow. What they didn't mention was that the older girl was still wearing diapers at night. It made for a very awkward conversation with the child and I only hope I was sensitive enough to not cause her any future trauma. 

Very, VERY weird. "

"Another hairy girl here. Middle school was the worst. I didn't have any way to remove the hair besides shaving, which I didn't do because I had an aunt who shaved her face and she always had stubble. I was also too embarrassed to ask my mom for other hair removal products. So I just sat there, hairy and sad and teased, until I had my own means of getting wax and whatnot, which was high school. I remember in 8th grade English we were reading a story about someone who had a harelip (am old term for cleft palate, I think) and someone called out,  ""Casey has a harelip!"" referring to my hairy upper lip. Then several more years of being called Harelip ensued. 

Yet, I somehow still didn't fix the problem. Much later,  in college, I saw a picture of myself taken from the side and realized that I had fucking full -on mutton chops. Wtf? I had no idea. I waxed those suckers and they never grew back aside from strays. 

It amazes me that I had a normal dating life when I was younger. A lot of boys liked me. I always think about Sarah Silverman talking about how a guy told her that her hairiness was attractive because it meant she had more testosterone which meant she must like sex. Maybe that was it. 🤣

When I changed over from temp to a perm contract with the firm, the agency phone call took about 5 mins, easy peasy I thought no fuss I'm now a proper employee on a slightly better contract, about 2 weeks later the supervisor girl asked me how much I got in back pay for my unclaimed holiday from the agency, had no idea what she was on about, explained it to me and 10 minutes later I gave the agency a bell, I told them i was calling up to claim it, they told me how much and a week later I had a nice little bonus of just over a grand.

"I caught my coworkers wife blowing a guy in a bar parking lot.  Long story short is that I'm a cop and caught them in the dudes car.  She told him she was single.  When I confronted them, he (the stranger) was pissed and she offered to blow me if I kept quiet.  Her husband is a good guy and I'm not a scumbag.  Tough call to make, but it had to be done."
"Funny you say that.  I visited a school near Camden with my parents, and took a wrong turn and ended up in the back roads of Camden and got a little lost.  A cop actually pulled us over to ask what we were doing there and then escorted us back to the Turnpike entrance.  Camden's no joke. "
"I wish I could recapture that excitement nowadays.  I remember when I first heard of Morrowind at school (I was still regularly playing Daggerfall on an old Packard Bell computer, running Windows 95).

I told my Ma, and she ended up buying it for my Dad on his birthday.  I was so excited, even if it wasn't my game.  I was pretty much glued to my father's side while we played through it."

"Less extreme, I lost my job about 2 years ago. My dad called me at 7:30 AM the next day, to berate me for being a lazy fuck for still being at home and not out looking for a job at 6am. The 2nd day, he did it again. The day after that, he did it again, but I turned all my phone notifications off until 8. I'm not 19 years old living at home or something. I own my own home, I've got credit cards and car payments, and other people that depend on me. I've my own reasons for needing to find a new job. None of them involve impressing my father. 

Needless to say my Dad is a bit abusive, even after being out of the house and on my own for a few decades."

I still sometimes just kind of narrate what I'm doing if I'm home alone and haven't spoken for a while. Just in case.
I had a coworker who cheated when she played games with three year olds.  When the kids called her out on it she would deny it and say that she was a teacher and whatever she did was allowed in the game.  Her entire self esteem seemed to be dependent on winning games designed for preschoolers.

"I just moved down to Texas. Here in Texas there is no state income tax. To make up this lost revenue, the property tax is higher than most other states.

"Don't let the world break you. It will knock you down, but get back up every single time. Sometimes life just sucks. It's unfair. It's hard. At times it seems like it's all bullshit.

They will let you down, but remember you'll likely be doing the same thing to others possibly without even realizing it, so be generous with your forgiveness. You'll need someone else to be with theirs. I'm sure of that. 

The good news is your character isn't dependent upon any of this. Life can kick your ass, but you can still choose to be something good in this world. We need that from you. You need that from you, because if you let the world take away your goodness, you lose too. The most important thing is to not let any of this make you lose hope, stop you from taking chances, or from trusting and loving others. That's all we really have. I know it's cheesy, but the older you get the more you'll understand that hope and love are what it's all about. As long as you still have even a little of both you can get through anything. "

"The answer is vertigo.

The sudden and acute sensation that the earth is no longer a stable point of reference.

Lots of people have been dizzy, which can be kind of funny.

Vertigo is fucked. The first time I had it, I woke up in the middle of the night and it felt like my bed was suspended from the ceiling and swinging back and forth like a carnival ride.

That lasted for three days in undulating waves of severity.

My explanation does not give justice to the fear of being cut loose in space, as if the ties of your physical world have been severed and you are tumbling through the ether that is still familiar to you, but different at the same time.

And just as quickly as it washes over you, it disappears.

Anyway, vertigo is fucked.

Edit after four hours: A good explanation for what it's like just came to me: Did you ever play a video game where the joystick didn't work right and having it in the center of the controller wouldn't center it?

So you have to push it all the way to the right to go forward, or vice versa.

That's what vertigo is like, only you can't really make the correct adjustment and everything just spins out of control."

"I volunteered for an animal shelter. One day I got asked to meet some people who threatened to kill some puppies if we didn't take them. 🙄  I met them at the shelter and placed the puppies in my van (I was taking them home to foster). We are supposed to 'try' to get a surrender fee from people. The one guy came into the shelter and signed the surrender form. I then asked him for $40. Like $40 for the whole litter. He grumbled , 'not my puppies. Ask the guy in the in the truck'. 


I'm 120lbs and 5'3. I go out and there is this huge guy in the truck. Long black hair. Huge muscles. Scowl on his face.  I bang on the window and ask for my $40 lol.  He tells me to fuck off and rolls the window back up. Like some sort of sucidal nutcase I start banging on the window demanding my $40. The other guy comes out of the building and other guy gets out of the truck flexing like he's gonna smash me.  He tells his friend to grab the puppies out of my van so they can take them out and kill them. I tell them to get away from my puppies and I'm calling the RCMP. They come after me like they are gonna do something to me. Fuck. Im alone in a deserted industrial area. So I decided to just out crazy them. I started flipping right the fuck out about how they need to bring me the mother dog if they can't afford $40. Pretty soon they were trying  to calm me down. 


We actually had a nice chat about how the shelter ran on just donations and how they really need to spay the mother dog. Lol 


TL;DR almost got killed over $40 but I out crazied the guys. "

"Not a social worker, but I worked with social workers for the pathways program which helps inner city kids get into and through college.

I had taught college freshmen history for a year when I got a classroom full of kids from North ave in Milwaukee. What blew my mind was that these students didn't even think like regular students from the rest of our state. Not only did they lack basic knowledge of history (what communism was, who fought in WWI) but they saw no benefit in learning it. After talking to them I realized that their entire lives they had been programmed to think in the short term. In how can we get enough money by the end of the month, how can we get our sister the things she needs, how can we stop our mom from getting sick.

The idea of learning for the value of learning and seeking opportunities was entirely foreign for them as they were always living from week to week.

But in terms of disturbing stories one student called me and asked of he could reschedule our 1on1 meeting because he was pretty sure his mom was gonna OD that night and he wanted to be home just in case."
"This is a huge factor in attractiveness.

I know from personal experience. I've met women who I've been immediately attracted to. Very good looking women, but then you get to know them and you slowly start to find thing about them that are physically unattractive. Next thing you know, you're not attracted to them at all. 

The inverse happens as well. I've met some average looking women who have beautiful personalities and I slowly started to find things about them that were physically attractive that you didn't notice before.

My wife on the other hand, I was already really attracted to her. Then I got to know her and she's even more beautiful now. "
"I personally hate the idea or stereotype that we all need to support the troops. I was in the Army and let me tell you: a lot of them are idiots and I mean *alot* of them.

These aren't the types of people we should be handing guns or worse: asking them to police the poor shitty countries we send them to. 

I am also not saying there aren't lots of regular or extraordinary people who just wanted to serve their country, but my experience is most of the ones I was with were generally pituitary retards trying to live out some real-life Call of Duty gun and war-boner. I've even gotten into a spat with a few military folks here on reddit who got pushy with me about my stance on this, but I don't give a shit. Just because you have a uniform on, doesn't automatically absolve you of your shitty and toxic attitude. In my experience, most idiots like this just wash out of the military eventually anyway.

My opinion is ""I support the troops, except for the ones who are assholes."" That should probably be an important thing for some of them to remember, as they continue to act like idiots.  "

Malfoy merely smirked and began to reply, ""No, Professor Ramsey. Although, Weasley may have, his family can probably only afford to...""

"I spent two and a half weeks backpacking in Olympic National Park. The weirdness happened about a week in.

I say ""about"" because the memory and the timetable of events is a bit fuzzy. I remember that I had gone bushwhacking the day before. This game trail I'd been following started to widen a little, and by midday of the second day I reached an abandoned cabin. It had obviously been neglected for a long time... the roof was covered in moss and the wooden walls seemed to be suffering from rot. Some weather seemed like it was going to move into the area, so I thought I'd take a break inside. It had a musty smell like wet stone, damp crawlspace, and rotting wood. Despite the smell, the cabin was quite spacious inside. Incredibly so, actually. There were two rooms, I remember, and a third door that went down a long, gently sloping stone tunnel that led down into what I assumed was a cellar. Looking back, I don't see how such a feature wouldn't have been visible from the outside... but there it was.

I turned on a flashlight and started walking down. It went on for an impossibly long distance. I had gone about 100 yards, and my flashlight beam just faded into darkness when I shone it down the path ahead. This was not a cellar. There was a stifiling, claustrophobic silence that seemed to press down on me the further I went. The darkness was disorienting, and I felt... almost intoxicated. I'd probably stumbled on a pocket of poorly oxygenated air. Whatever it was, I'm glad I had enough sense left to I nope the fuck out of there pretty quickly.

Here's the strange thing, though. I know I couldn't have gone more than 100 or 200 yards down that tunnel. I wasn't inside the cabin for even an hour, but by the time I got out of the it was morning. I had spent the better part of a *day* inside.

Needless to say, I backtracked and got the fuck out of there."

"Back in 2007 when Britney Spears had a bit of a breakdown and shaved her head, I noticed a few people on eBay claiming to sell strands of her hair picked up from the salon floor. 

16 year old me thought I'd try and take advantage of the public's stupidity and so I cut a few of my hairs off, took a picture of them, claimed my uncle who works at the salon gave them to me and then put them up for a Buy It Now price of £100. Just for 1 day, to see if I'd get any bites or interest. 

Within about an hour they'd sold and I couldn't believe it. Annoyingly though, as I was under 18 I'd had to use my mum's eBay account to do this, so I told her about it and asked if she could withdraw the money, but instead she made me refund the idiot and tell them it was a joke. "
"I was in my freshman dorm with a buddy and there was a party going on in another dorm room. We proceeded to head over and had a few beers and decided to get high. One of the guys in the room was asking people if they wanted to do mushrooms with him. I politely declined as he opened a bag and shoved what appeared to be at least an eighth into his mouth. We stayed for about another hour before someone suggested that we move the party into the orchard that was right next to the dorm building so we could smoke cigarettes. So about 20 of us moved from this tiny dorm room outside. Only one of us decided to stay: mushroom guy. We asked him several times if he wanted to come and he said that he was fine and that he didn't want to go outside. 

So we enjoyed a few darts outside and after about 45 minutes decided to go back to the dorm room. As we were walking up the stairs to the 2nd floor we smelled it before we saw it. We turned the corner to the hallway and saw Shroom guy spread eagle on the ground completely naked. There was shit everywhere. On the floor on the wall. It looked like he had tried to make cave paintings on the walls with his own shit. He sees us and stands up and comes over to try and hug us, but we say stay back because he has shit all over his hands and chest. His friends immediately beckon him into the dorm room and throw him in the shower. My buddy and I immediately bolted back to our dorm room. 

I heard that the RA's found everything the morning after and were so pissed that they went door to door and threatened to get the shit tested for DNA unless someone fessed up. Shroom guy eventually did tell the RA and was subsequently kicked out of the dorm.

So, the stacks are lit up 24/7 even when the power goes out in the area and the businesses are required to close unless specific events happen by 11pm. The  small area has it's own specific police force. So the theory is the stacks are actually nuclear silos. It would explain all the things I listed above and them being camo'd as stacks makes sense to defend the people and deter an attack on a populated area."

I'm pretty sure Reader's Digest had a section that contained every clean joke you can think of at some point. It's where Dad's learned their Dad jokes.
"So I was like 3, my sister was 4 and my brother was an infant. My biological father kidnapped us from Iowa and took us to New Mexico, where he left us with our grandmother, his mom, for 8 months. While we were living with my grandmother, I guess my mom would call looking for him and looking for us, and grandma would tell my mom she didn't know where he was and she didn't know where we were. She even cut me and my sister's hair off to make us look like little boys so no one would recognize us. I guess one day my biological father came to his mom's and kidnapped us again from her this time, where she called my mom and told her what was going on. Mom got on a bus and came to get us. I don't remember much because I was so little but I remember this part, he had taken us to a homeless shelter where the police found us. They arrested him and kept us safe until our mom got there and took us back home on a bus. I didn't find out how long we had actually been gone until I was in college, like 18 years old, talking with my mom about it. From my memory the whole thing seems like just a span of days, not months. I don't know whatever happened with my biological father's arrest, I don't know what they charged him with, I don't know if my grandmother ever even got in trouble. I never talked to him and he died when I was 16. Of course I don't associate with that side of the family at all either. "

"This isn't always true.  But I have lived in poor nieghborhoods and rich ones.

When a poor persons car breaks down, they have to call Uncle Ted.  because Uncle Ted sometimes knows how to fix cars.

Rich people can have a stay at home nanny to watch their kid.  Poor people have to drop off their kid with a family member while they go to work.

Poor: dependent on each other to survive.

"I work on a research vessel and in the North Atlantic around 2011 we saw some extremely bright object fly into the water. Not fall, but with a trajectory and no sound. It was blinding to look at and bright neon green which illuminated the entire sky. It split the low lying clouds like a sheet and continued to glow until it reached a depth where the light couldn't escape to our vantage point. 
Me and the other watch standers all saw it and there was much debate and confusion with no answers. The next night it was like we went into a bird portal. Literally all kinds of sea birds just in a confused tumult, smacking into our radars and falling from the sky.  Even some that I wouldn't think could be out so far. Shit creeped me out to no end.

"Don't want to burst your bubble, but I didn't. I spent a year and a half working as a freelance writer and it was the hardest year of my life. You need an incredible amount of determination and I believe have to be one of those people whose natural disposition is to work. You also need the ability to get back up each time you're knocked down.

On the plus side, that year was a fantastic boost to my portfolio and resume and allowed me to secure a job as a marketing assistant in an international company with huge advancement opportunities.

A lot of people tout freelancing as being a way to free up your time and be 'in control' of your life. I found the opposite: you have to be constantly working to stay afloat, and when you're not, you're worried about working. Now, I have set hours each week, have more than enough to get by and enjoy life and the rest of the time is my own.

I don't even mind staying behind later, because here my work is actively appreciated by someone other than me, which in itself is a huge boon.

I'm not looking to dissuade you, but whenever I see posts like this I like to offer my two cents. Freelancing is hard, dirty, and more fail than succeed. You have to be ready for the hardest challenge of your life, to take the pain and say 'that the best you've got?'

But if you're intent on it, my advice would be: be upfront about your costing, don't devalue yourself to get work (seriously, there's a million people offering copy for a few cents a word, the market is saturated), and pick a niche that you at least have some interest or knowledge in. That'll put you head and shoulders above others.

And if it doesn't work out, don't consider it a failure. Use what you learned, and the portfolio you built, to find something that's a better fit for you.

Good luck."

"I moved into a room of a non smoking, no pets house that two Chinese international students already lived in for a year. First month was great, we're all gamers, and occasionally yell profanity at our computer screens, but bond over LoL.

Second month things started to go downhill. The guy upstairs decided to take up smoking, in his room. Even after the landlord yelled at him, he refused to go outside to smoke, but would occasionally open a window. This was the middle of the summer.

Halfway through the second month, the guy on the main floor stopped cleaning anything. His dishes, his room, his laundry. He'd pick up dirty clothes and wear them again, then add them back to the dirty pile the next day.

In the third month, the girlfriend of the guy upstairs moved back to China, and left 3 rabbits and 2 hamsters with him. He had no idea how to take care of animals, and let them all die in their cages. He didn't even remove the bodies as they died, but just threw out the whole cage when the rabbits started to smell.

In month four, I got an apartment by myself. "

"(Ex)Friend of mine cheated on her husband while he was away at school (military). She unfortunately decided to tell me about it. Two days later I got this frantic phone call at 0530 saying that she and her kid needed a place to stay the night because her husband had caught her having an early morning phone conversation with the fuck buddy. Within 12 hours she had a court-issued restraining order, claiming that he had beaten on her a few times. Except that I was friends with her husband as well. He's he most peacefully non-violent person I've ever met and is actually quite a pushover. 


So now this guy is being escorted from his house by police. Isn't allowed within 50 feet of the house or her or his own kid. Cops gave him 10 minutes to pack a bag and get out. For the next three months, he's living out of this bag, moving from house to house, crashing with friends. Meanwhile, his house that he's not allowed anywhere near, isn't even occupied because his wife and kid are living with her fuck buddy. 


Eventually he gets himself together and starts taking her to court for custody and divorce. Everything slowly starts coming to light. When things start going south for her, she cries rape. The judge calls out her bs but the military doesn't, and they open up a full blown investigation.  The guy is a CID agent. He investigates rapes for a living. But with her accusation, he loses his badge and his gun and gets pulled from every case he was on. Becomes a glorified door greeter. The investigation takes so long that his reenlistment window closes and he's forced to get out, after 10 years of service. 


He actually managed to get full custody of his kid and the rape charges were dropped. But all he's ever wanted to be is a cop and now as a civilian he's having difficult getting a job because all they see is that he was charged at one point in time. He's had to sell his motorcycle and refinance his truck just to make ends meet. "

"I have this theory that George Washington was the most ""I'll figure it out as I go along"" person in history.

He decided to cross the Hudson at night in the Revolutionary War. At the time that was unheard of. Supposedly there's reports that he wasn't sure what his plan of attack was when he crossed the Hudson as he was only interested in seeing how far they could get. Idk how true this is.

He intended to retire after the war and had a bunch of people knocking on his door asking him to be the new leader of the new country. He didn't want to do it but agreed anyway. Then when he was ready to be done being president, they asked him to do it again and he was like ""Jesus you guys are fucking helpless without me.""

After his second term, he was like ""I'm done! I'm not doing this again!"" Then he found out about how America was going down the path of a two-party system and was like ""You dumb mother fuckers! How fucking stupid are you people? You know what, I'm not helping you anymore. Yall figure it out yourself, and if you shit the bed then you have to clean it up!""

"That what you think you meant by saying something is not always what someone heard, and what you heard is not always what someone meant.

Don't get all pissy when somebody doesn't see things the same way you do, *especially* when those things are your own actions.

"We were in the car listening to the radio when the host starts talking to a vet about administering animal first aid (BBC Radio 2, in case you're wondering- they cover a lot of things unrelated to music) She explains that many dogs are injured or killed each year by people throwing sticks for them to fetch, as the sticks can splinter and injure their mouth and/or throat. She recommended a dog toy instead.
Boyfriend immediately goes off on one, saying dogs have chased sticks for millions of years and that no dog has ever died from it. I point out that the vet on the radio just described several instances where dogs had died. He continued shouting about ""political correctness gone mad"". I said again that she's a vet, she's clearly seen these injuries enough times to notice a pattern and warn people about stick danger. He decided it was a ""conspiracy"" designed to sell dog toys rather than good old-fashioned, low cost sticks. I pointed out that vets can charge a lot more for life-saving stick removal surgery than a dog toy, and that the vet hadn't even recommended a specific brand. Nope- sticks are great for playing fetch and all dog owners should throw sticks. He was SO ANGRY. We didn't even have a dog. "

What made it especially difficult for the dad was that the son had killed himself *with the dad's service revolver that was kept in the house*.  Dad obviously held a ton of guilt for that.

Anyway, I communicate with the wife that I need to come to the house and get the husband into the hospital for an evaluation, even if it's just to keep him safe for a few days.  I tell her I'll come with a few officers.  She reluctantly agrees - it was almost like she regretted telling us once she found out what we had to do.

It was one of those ""now that I have this information I have to act on it"" type of deals.

Anyway, we show up at the house (me and two officers).  Husband answers the door, I introduce myself and ask if I can come in.  Husband agrees but has this absolutely shocked look on his face.

As we're walking to a table to sit down he says the absolute worst thing you could hear in that moment, especially for for me.  

He turns to me and says, **""I'm sorry I look so surprised, but when you came to the door I thought you were my son.  You look so much like him.""**

Yeah, that's like the worst thing to hear in that situation.  It turns out I really did look like this guy's son, and at that moment I was about the age that his son killed himself.  

Anyway, I was able to convince him to go to the hospital to get evaluated after a while.  At first he wasn't going to budge.  

Last I heard the he and his wife were still both doing well.

Soooo...while it might not be the *worst* case, it was the most jarring to me in that exact moment.

"This makes me so sad. I have a few friends with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID, the current terminology for what was once called multiple personality disorder), and honestly media gives them such a bad reputation.

Usually people who develop DID had extremely traumatic childhoods. Lived through shit so bad that their consciousness sheared into multiple pieces (""alters""). Each alter can have different genders, ages, names, memories, even accents! But each piece has its own place in the puzzle, or ""system,"" as people with DID refer to themselves.

There is usually at least one protector-type in the system, an alter that was created to save the original person from intolerable situations. These alters are usually braver and may even be physically stronger than others, but the alter can still be any age/gender.

There are also child alters. They just never grew up. They usually serve the role of a ""normal child,"" having childlike innocence and all that. When the system was a child, this alter might have taken over at school in order to play and make friends. Sometimes this alter doesn't even know about the trauma that the system faced, though some are able to communicate with the system and others do have memories of trauma. Sometimes a child alter is also the protector.

There are also some types of alters modeled after the system's abuser. Persecutors are like the victim blamers. They blame the original personality for the abuse and will try to convince them that they need to pay for it. Eventually these nagging feelings can lead to self harm or suicide attempts. Perpetrators are another - however instead of directing all the anger inward, they direct it at others.

It just pains me to see a disorder so complex, and still so unknown, be treated the way it is by society. Most people with DID are just trying to make the best with the crap hand they were dealt."

"Currently hiding from my grandparents that I'll be taking my fiancee's last name when we get married. My mom suggested I should wait until after the wedding to tell them or else my grandpa might get upset and not go then regret not going after the fact. I was engaged once before and mentioned to them that time that I wanted to change to the original spelling of our name and they didn't seem thrilled. And even after that relationship dissolved it was brought up frequently. 

When my current fiancee and I got engaged they joked that I had been pencilled into the will pending what my last name turned out to be. That really pissed me off because it felt like they were trying to buy me. I don't care if I'm in the will I just want a good relationship with them, getting an inheritance comes at too great of a cost(their lives). I do hope they don't write me out just because I don't want my last memory of them being that they wanted to tell me fuck you from beyond the grave.

All will be well in the end as long as I'm married to my beautiful fiancee I'll be happy. Reasons for those curious: I've hated my last name for as long as I can remember, I like the way my name sounds with hers, and she's always been fond of her name so it works out great for us."

"You really can't fire someone for being slow. Like.. I guess you can but.. you can't. 

I manage a restaurant. There are certain people who are just slow. And no amount of practice is going to change that. They just move at this pace that isn't conducive to working a cook line. You can do all the coaching in the world, and it won't matter. 

There's this one guy we'll call Jordan. Jordan moves at the speed of mud. His mouth is always slacked open and he speaks in such a monosyllabic fashion that you'd wonder if it was a put-on. 

We have Texas toast where I work. The procedure for dropping Texas toast is as follows. Pick up piece of bread, brush garlic butter across piece of bread, drop on flat top for 45 seconds. Flip for an additional 45 seconds. Serve. The end. Simple. I can drop an entire loaf of Texas Toast in under 20 seconds, followed by the 2-45 second cook times. This is a SIMPLE PROCEDURE. 

Jordan stands there with his loose jaw flapping in the wind meticulously placing garlic butter on every square inch of each piece of bread, resulting in one fucking piece of toast being completely toasted by the time the next piece hits the flat top. 

I've gone over to him and demonstrated time and again. ""Jordan, it's a quick process. Brush, drop, brush, drop, brush, drop, brush, drop, hit timer. Wait. Flip. Hit timer again. Serve."" He nods his head affirmatively then proceeds to butter every square inch of the bread again. 

He walks one-foot per minute to the fridge to grab cheese sticks to drop in the fryer. He spends 5 solid minutes putting chicken on a plate. 

He's horrible. 

Half the time I just tell him to go do dishes. 

But I can't really fire him because TECHNICALLY he's not doing anything WRONG exactly, he's just doing a poor version of the correct thing. "

"I'm not the social worker in this case, but I've been following closely the case of Carl DeBrodie:

The backstory here is that Carl DeBrodie is a 31 year old mentally disabled man who was living in some sort of group home or similar assisted living facility. He was reported missing from the facility on April 17th of this year. He allegedly walked away on his own in the early morning. He was found about a week later encased in cement in a storage unit. I can't find any information on how the body was discovered aside from police receiving a tip. I have no information on who the storage unit was rented to, but I would imagine that would be a great lead. 

Well, obviously being encased in cement isn't a good sign, but police suspect that the facility where he was living isn't being honest about the circumstances of his disappearance. First of all, his family and his previous guardian are saying there was ongoing abuse at the facility, but also that they were denied access to him for months prior to his disappearance. 

http://www.fultonsun.com/news/local/story/2017/apr/30/dark-path-how-carl-debrodie-came-second-chance/671995/

His former guardian said: 

&gt;""He was at my house for Christmas one year and he had bruised ears, bruised body, a bruised eye, and that wasn't the end of his bruises,"" Martin said. Martin claimed she called a hotline to report potential abuse at Second Chance in 2010.

&gt;""After my hotline call and me taking this to the guardianship, I wasn't allowed to talk to him on the phone,"" Martin said. ""(Second Chance) would hang up on me or they wouldn't answer.""

His mother also claims they disallowed visits. 

&gt;""For the last two and a half, three years, we have not been able to see my son, Carl DeBrodie, because they wouldn't let us,"" Summers said. 

After his body was found, the investigation took a different direction. His body showed way more decomposition than would be seen if he died a week ago. They now believe he was dead well before he was reported missing. The most notable clue is that the same day he was reported missing was the exact day that a new company took over the facility. In other words, they're thinking that he died months before, but when the new company took over, they suddenly had to come up with an explanation why this guy was on the books as living at facility, yet was nowhere to be found. 

The part I find strange about this is that there are unquestionably multiple people involved in his care. Like, you don't just have one person provide 24/7/365 care for the guy. What were all those people told about his absence? How many people were in on this? Evidently there were social workers who were supposed to have face to face visits with him, but the facility would cancel them and the social workers would just say ""okay, no problem"". It's unclear how long it's been since anyone has seen Carl face to face.

Speaking of the extra appendage, it's annoying. I'm pretty jealous of women not telegraphing when they're sexually aroused. Not to mention how much it hurts to get kicked in the bollocks, versus how funny it is to everyone around. 

Having someone buy me a drink every once in awhile would not be an unpleasant thing. While girls complain about being treated as an object, (as a bisexual man in a gay bar I understand better than most) it does feel nice to be desired, sought-after, and valued. "

"The pet industry.

Breeding practices and the housing, medical care, etc. for animals like rabbits, rodents, birds and puppies are typically cruel mill conditions. Generally the people who breed animals of any kind to be sold in a store don't give a shit about them and just see them as a money maker. Practices like this can cause a lot of health and behavior issues for the animals, and many animals in stores are sick or regularly die. Everything from the smallest mouse to a German Shepherd puppy is affected. If you want a pet you should get them from someone who cares about them. Those people are never in stores or ""buy and ship"" websites like puppyfind.com. 

And if you want a more exotic pet like a sugar glider or parrot? Just...don't. Don't unless you rescue them. Animals like this are often kidnapped from the wild, many dying en route. Many exotic pets also suffer from a lot of health and psychological issues because they're not getting the diet, environment or general lifestyle they need to have. Even if you're a ""good"" owner to some of these pets, they're still kind of suffering or struggling because they physically and psychologically haven't adapted to living as a pet like a cat, dog, ferret, etc. 

Even certain practices in breeders who don't sell to stores or even some rescues is so much shadier and complex than people realize. There's a whole world of animal politics and constant fighting on lots of different sides about how and why to keep animals. "

"Not me but I got a couple that I've picked up from other truck drivers shooting the breeze at restaurants. Both guys were owner-operators that also owned their own trailers, so they ran fully solo and just picked loads from a board instead of hauling company trailers and going where dispatch asked.

First guy gets loaded and after the fork truck driver hands him the load paperwork, he demands a lumper fee for the loading. Driver says no, the contract the load broker signed clearly states 'broker pays all loading and unloading fees,' so call them about it. Well they call and the broker starts humming and hawing about it with the shipper, holding the driver for ransom basically. Driver gets fed up and tells the broker he's bailing on this load since they've wasted X number of hours, also a breach of the contract they signed with him, and he tells the shipper to unload him so he can leave. Shipper lady gets combative and threatens to call his company, he says 'alright then, go ahead.' She calls and his cell phone rings. He answers and shouts 'MY FUCKING TRUCK, MY FUCKING TRAILER, GET YOUR SHIT OUT OF IT.'

Second guy runs refrigerated freight, gets a load from a broker, they sign the contract he sends them without any fuss. Load is ice cream. In the contract he sent, it clearly states (paraphrasing): 'I don't like to sit and wait for loading/unloading. If a shipper or receiver takes longer than 2 hours, YOU (the broker) pay me $500/hour, within 24 hours, including the first two hours of waiting.' So the shipper takes an hour and a half to load two pallets, he's getting antsy about sitting so long and goes in to check on why they're so slow, and the place is empty. He goes around the front of the building and knocks on a window where someone is working inside, they tell him 'oh yeah shipping has left for the night. They'll finish loading you in the morning.' This doesn't fly with him so he calls the broker, and reminds them of his contract terms. 'It's been two hours now, if there's not a check deposited to my account within the next hour for $1500 AND this shipper gets their fork truck guy back out here and finishes loading NOW, I'm bailing.' Broker says there's no chance they'll pay him anything at all for the wait, contract be damned, so he pulls away from the dock, and shoves out the two pallets of ice cream and leaves. Shipper later sues broker for lost product and delaying that load, broker sues driver, driver counter-sues for breach of contract and failure to pay plus all legal costs, and he won. Broker paid out the nose because they didn't read the contract.

Cop surveys the situation for a few minutes, sighs and asks 'How sturdy is your truck?' Guy's truck is triple-framed with solid steel front bumper, won't even ring if you kick it. Cop says 'See those cars parked on that red paint? That's a fire lane - no parking. Push 'em out of the way.' Guy said the first few got pushed aside by the truck, the ones nearest the corner got gouged by the bulldozer blade hanging off the side of the trailer, cop was writing tickets and leaving them on windshields the entire time.

"Alright kid, buckle up, this goes from zero to a hundred real quick.

Freshman year, my buddies and I were all hanging out in one of our dorm rooms, a big room, probably like six of us with room to spare. We got reaaaally high a bit earlier and decided to setup 3 xbox 360s and tvs in the room and dominate some team death match on COD. It was pretty fun not gunna lie, and we ran house. Anyways, about an hour later we get a knock on the door from our RA. Nothing unusual, they did a round on Friday's and Saturday's in the freshy dorms. But then we get a knock again like 5 minutes later, also not unusual because sometimes the RAs would try and be sneaky by closely staggering the rounds. Only it wasn't an RA, it was about 12 people here for a ""party,"" mostly chicks. Good looking chicks.

Lights out, music blasting, and drinks poured, all before the door closed behind them. My friends and I kinda looked at each other trying to figure out if anyone had invited other people over. I still don't know to this day, but fuck it, they were all familiar faces on campus to me, so we put the controllers away and join in.

Not long after, I go out for another blaze sesh with a gorgeous looking girl, and we come back to some people doing body shots off of three girls. My new smoking buddy just starts giggling, and I had never seen it before. Two of the drinkers were my friends, so I cheer them on because I think you cheer people who do that? Other people were... maybe, idk, who cares. I'm far gone at this point, so I have a seat in my favorite chair in the corner, down a shot of something, crack a beer, and just kinda settle in. Next thing I know I'm getting a lap dance from my cute smoking buddy. My fucking face when, I was loving it.

Then off goes her top. Oh shit, alright I guess everyone is watching me pitch a tent because this girl was packing. But then a few other girls take their tops off too. I'm spaced out watching these jugs jiggle around the room, I'm sure most of the guys were. Clothes start flying off here, there, and everywhere. I'm zoned out watching all these beautiful rando girls just frolicking around naked in my friends room. I snap back to reality when I hear moaning close to my ear. One of the rando girls is getting plowed by one of the rando guys up against the wall. Then another, then another. In my drunk stupor I look around and whiteness an orgy unfold in my friends room. People on the bed, people on the floor, people on the walls, friends and random alike; they would've been fucking on the ceiling if they could.

Then I realize I'm the only person with clothes on. Ok, so do I join in? No. You see, getting drunk is like autism, it's all on a spectrum. And unfortunately for me, I was well beyond the point of whiskey dick drunk, teetering on brown out. I get up to leave but then the cute smoking buddy I was with earlier - now naked and sweaty - sits me back down and tries giving me head. Sorry babe, we got a man down tonight. So instead she curls up in my lap and makes out with me. Probably the cutest thing anyone has ever done for me in my life. I tell her to go get a blunt ready, she does, comes and curls back in my lap, and I start stroking her hair like some pet. Disregarding school policy and smoke alarms, I crack a window and start smoking away as I sat there and watched a sea of bodies ejaculate all over each other. I felt like a king."
"Homeless whilst addicted to amphetamines in the 90s. My mum had to lock me out the house as i was Stealing anything and everything. I was a complete cunt.

Anyway I ended up sleeping in abandoned buildings, bus stops and drug dealing shit holes.

Was once in this drug house and a guy burst in with a stun gun shouting he wanted anyone's money and drugs as he was going to be sent to prison once the police caught him so he had nothing to lose. 

The saddest thing was this. The guy who sold the drugs in that house, it was his home. He lived there 24/7. It was bare floors. Bare walls. No cooker no fridge no electricity or water. It was living in 3rd world conditions. I once witnessed his ex girlfriend come and drop his kid off with him. As she sat in the lounge waiting for him, he was injecting speed in another room.

I think in that period I saw some truly depraved and degenerate things....been a lot more cynical about people since then"

EDIT2: Right... it would back up and pool at the source unless prevented... which again, if the water is highly contaminated... probably still a bad thing. Now I'm wondering if it would be possible and feasible to construct a system which would shut off the public access pipes with the foam and immediately open up other exits leading to an overflow tank equipped to contain a certain amount of toxic/radioactive etc. compounds.

The only place was McDonald's and the average age for a worker there is there mid 20's.

"When I was young, 13-15, I did not really have a source of masturbation but I was really horny and got boners all the time. Because of my dad's excessive use of porn, my mom hates it and feels it's completely unnecessary and will ruin my view of sex. So, I was not allowed my own computer until after I graduated. The only computer was in the family computer room which had no door and the history was constantly checked. So, while playing The Sims, I began making families of one man who looked somewhat like me, and 4 scantily clad women. I made them make out and masturbated to that. My mom figured I was masturbating to something because I always said ""hold on"" when she knocked and the tv was turned off when she entered. She said she was afraid I was being given porn videos from upperclassmen. One day she had a plan, she said she was looking for something in the storage closet that's in my room. While I looked, she turned on the tv and made her horrifying discovery. She began asking awkward questions that were shameful and uncomfortable. What's worse, she told her coworkers ""for advice"". 

Now that I'm grown and have my own computer, I jack off to real porn now."
"it's not really like a story but rather 2 years of interactions with her. Like, I considered her my friend and all but sometimes she did things that could mean something, I'm not sure  
  
Like there was a time where she when and talked to me, or rather interrogating me, in an empty classroom about what I was doing for my future. Other time, she was talking with her friends about her dress and all of the sudden she asked me what I though of it and thought that my obvious respond was funny. In another time she straight up went, gave me a hug while I was sitting on the floor and she was wearing a skirt, if I looked up I'd have seen her panties  
  
And many other more. I don't know, I think I liked her as a friend, but since always for some reason I've had a lot of female friends and no one acted like she did. It'd be nice to know what she really thought of me."

Sure I could give it to him for free but how are you *that* old and still don't understand courtesy and manners. He ended up taking the pizza. Damn right. "

"Not a teacher but I'll never forget my excuse October 15,2009. 

I attended an all-boys jesuit high school in Colorado. I say that because there are some teachers that would insult us, joke with us and all that stuff in a good-nature that guys do with each other. 

October 15 I show up at my Theology class sophomore year around noon or so and walk in about an hour late to class. This teacher was notorious for teasing students and was held in high esteem by almost every student. 

He joked at me about why I was late ""Oh look at this. He is an hour late and only in record time to style his wavy hair."" Stuff like that. 

After a few and some laughs I responded with, there's a boy who accidentally trapped himself in a giant weather-balloon and is floating thousands of feet above FoCo (Fort Collins). 

The teacher laughed and said ""that is the wildest excuse I've ever heard"" and then said if I was lying I would receive 3 demerits. 

Sure enough a few minutes later, ""Oh my god! There's a kid in a freaking balloon!"" 

And we ended up stopping the planned discussion and live streamed the news by a projector with another class. 

Fun stuff. "

"Dude I grew up in your family. My mom was a doctor and my dad was a ""stay at home dad"" although I wouldn't say that because he did so much in and out of the household. He took up carpentry and sold handmade lamps, started beekeeping and lent out hives to local farmers and sold honey at farmers markets. He was a singer, and put on concerts that everyone in our town would go to. We lived in a hell of a fixer upper also, so he would constantly be working on the house, and remodeled half of it all by himself. I also went to a Montessori school and never really was in daycare or had baby sitters. 

BUT on my end, after a while money became a big cause of tension for them, as my mom got burnt out from her job, and it caused lots of grudges to be held and ultimately ended their marriage. So just be careful you don't let it get to that point, your kids can sense it."

"The most entertaining was from years ago when I was a kid. My parents bought a newly constructed house in Reston, VA in 1986, the neighbors house was a few months older than ours. It was owned by a retired couple, in the late 90's when this occured, they were in their mid 70's. My dad called the HOA the ""Reston Communist Party"", and my favorite story was this: 

Those neighbors have one of the largest models in the neighborhood, the house and yard were immaculately maintained, and it was a pale yellow color with black shutters. I think 1996-7... they got a notice from the HOA that they had not sought approval from the association for the color of their house and shutters and furthermore that the color choice was deemed unfitting or whatever and it would need to be changed.

The house had never been painted, it had been pale yellow with black shutters when it was built 10 years ago. If you want to see outrage, wear a pastel polo shirt and initiate an argument with a 75 year old couple (who were both WWII veterans btw... she was a field nurse) that the home that they took immense pride in was unfit for the neighborhood.

On one occasion, they had family friends visiting with their three children, so I worked a full day taking care of the five kids while the four adults just hung out in the house, ostensibly working from home but really just drinking wine and hanging out. I understand occasionally having the nanny come while you're there so you can work well from home, but nannying five children whose parents were ten feet away was a little absurd.
The second thing is that they reused ziploc bags. I honest to god probably spent at least 45 minutes a day washing, drying, and organizing their ziploc bags."
I feel like the time of day is not an important piece of information in this story. It's not like this could have happened at 4pm and you'd be like 'Haha classic Tom!'

"5 Centimeters per Second

The way the main characters pass by each other at the end and don't even remember each other *really* screwed with my mind. That, combined with the beautiful scene of them huddling together at the train station on the frigid winter night, promising to write each other forever, but they letters slowly stop being written until they stop altogether. The theme of moments and even people being only fleeting moments in your life left me feeling incredibly empty after the movie. "

"A girl at my last corporate gig blew three guys (I stopped counting at 3) in the bathroom of the bar we had rented out for the evening. Poor girl, really pretty, just low self-esteem I suppose. 

After that they had to move her from right behind reception to a hidden corner by HR because people kept walking by her desk, ogling, snickering. Wasn't very nice at all.

Incidentally, two of the guys she felated were married with children. It was then I realized I was a bit more mature than I used to be. Old me would have been one of the ogler/snickerers. This me was like ""why the fuck aren't they walking by the guys' desks and laughing/mocking them""?"
"Worked for a small computer repair company, 4 people total: the boss, two grease monkeys (we did all the small stuff like reformats and virus removable) and the secretary. It was awesome, I loved that job, the boss and my co-worker were super chill and helpful. But the secretary, we'll call her Lorelei, was a different story. When I started working I got a text from an old friend of mine warning me about her, apparently I had been hired because he had just been fired because of her.... ok, I thought... but she was great, very helpful and nice. She'd being us Starbucks once in a while and other little niceties. Maybe my old friend had been the problem? Any way life was great.... 

The months passed and things started to change. The nice secretary came out one day and told us she was no longer a 'secretary ' but the 'Office manager' and berated us any time we didn't call her the 'office manager.' It was strange, but whatever. A little while later I get called in to the bosses office where she is standing right next to him like Iago perched on Jafars shoulder, she tells me my work priorities have been shifted,  I was no longer allowed to work on any computer that came into the shop or go out on service calls.  Instead,  she said I was to monitor and report on our customers server activity.... uh.... ok, I guess this must be important? 

For the next week I'm confinded to my desk and printed out about small batches of computer jargon that made very little sense and took less than an hour to do. When I asked what else I should do, she would intervene before my boss responded and told me to try to improve the reports... whatever that meant. 

The next Monday she calls me into the office again and says I'm on work probation, I have 3 weeks to be more productive or I'll be fired. Apparently I wasn't doing enough to earn a paycheck? 

I did my best to make the reports as readable as possible,  and when no one was looking I'd finish up clients computers that were on the work bench (simple stuff like clicking next after a virus scan) until she caught me and reprimanded me for half an hour about how I don't have permission to do anything outside my job description. 

I gave up, sad to admit, I could see the writing on the wall,  I spent the last week goofing off on my computer until the next Monday. 

I get called into the office.... there's the boss I once respected sitting like a beat dog and Lorelei sitting like a queen in her palace... She tells me i haven't improved my performance and they're sorry but here's my last check, good bye. I turn to my boss and look him square in the eye and asked him if he really agreed with it,  he slumped his shoulders and said ""kinda"" 

I went home and texted that old friend asking him what happened when he got fired, he told me pretty much the same story I just went through. Later on I hear they hired some other kid to take my place... same thing ends up happening to him. 

Jeez, sorry for the novel, I don't talk about this very much,  I guess it just feels good to let it out. Thanks for reading if you didn't just skip her to the bottom! 

PS, she eventually got fired after trying to get rid of the best tech guy they had (my coworker/superior) I think my old boss finally grew a spine. She ended up leaving her husband and two daughters for another woman who eventually left her... no idea where she is now, don't care. "

"I always worry about that if I'm poking around abandoned places. The only time I did come across someone in an abandoned place was when I was in a very large abandoned building with a friend who had been there before and he knew the guy lived there so we visited him and hung out for a while while he showed us just how functional his squat was thanks to his tech knowledge. I do worry about it though. I like exploring, but I don't wish to intrude on anyone.

"I support Trump's travel ban and I think Liberal Western society is committing suicide by being too accepting of Islam. And I say that as a Bernie Sanders-supporting liberal. Point out all the awful Bible passages you want to make your false equivalency all you want, but what matters is what actually happens in the world.

Every majority Islamic country violates the basic human rights of its citizens. Every. Single. One. Give it a favorable position in government and it will always always *always* oppress religious minorities. *Always*. You can't even hold up Turkey as a counterpoint to that anymore. It's gone over to the extremists just like all the other countries. Every poll taken of muslim populations living in Liberal Western Democracies indicates, not always majorities, but large-enough-to-be-disturbing minorities who despise liberal values like freedom of religion, large percentages of muslims who, for example, wouldn't report a Islamic terrorist plot if they knew about it beforehand, think people who leave Islam should get the death penalty, want to abolish freedom of speech, freedom of religion, etc.

So, if I see a Muslim on the street I'm not going to be afraid of them trying to harm my physically. But what I *am* afraid of are the 24% of young American Muslims who think violence in the name of Islam is at least sometimes justified. I'm not afraid of them attacking me in the street, but I am afraid of *who they're going to vote for* and *what laws those politicians would try to pass.*

The danger is not violent terrorists coming into the country. The danger is that we're importing literally hundreds of thousands of people here to don't share our values, don't believe in freedom of speech/religion, want people to be executed for changing their minds about Islam, etc. The danger is these hundreds of thousands--probably even millions--of people forming large enough voting blocs to eventually elect pro-Sharia politicians to congress, perhaps even get them on the Supreme Court.

This isn't about religion, this is about allowing people to be citizens before they've been convinced that Western liberal democracy is the superior culture. This is about importing people who would, if given the opportunity, vote away every civil right and undo every bit of progress we've made in the last 200 years. I think if you're going to come to this country, regardless of your religion, race, etc. the criteria should simply be do you support freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press? Can you handle it when people say and do things that offend you? I read a few years ago about how The Netherlands was including video footage of nude women on beaches to specifically weed out extremist muslims from emigrating, sending a message of ""this is who we are, don't come here if you can't handle that."" We need a similar video for America, showing the absolute most offensive things someone like that might run into. We need to stop apologizing for who we are. Instead of trying to cow-tow to every culture and please everyone, we need to say ""this is who we are. Either accept that or don't come here."""

"Not a coworker but something I did. Oddly proud of it, though.

I worked in a clothing company's call center taking orders at the time. The environment was slightly casual but still fairly professional. One day the servers went completely down but our phones were still working. (Servers were housed off site in another city.) We were required to continue taking calls and apologize that we couldn't process any orders/returns/et cetera at that time.

I was starting to get frustrated explaining to people how I could answer the phone and not be able to process any transactions, so I took a longish bathroom break just to get off the phones for a while. The bathrooms were near a product room. The room had one of nearly everything we sold and we were allowed to put customers on hold and grab the item so we could answer their questions about it better.

I decided to grab a sheet set and several pillows. I then proceeded to turn the cubby (area where your feet go) under my desk into a pillow fort and crawled in. I took my headset in with me and continued to answer calls. It wasn't like I needed access to my computer at the time.

3.) It has to be aesthetically creepy to boot.

"Ideally, you're not supposed to be paying child support.  Because...no divorce.  Now, I totally understand that divorce happens, and the fact that the rule presumes otherwise shows you how old the rule is (and it IS every bit that old).
   
Consider the reverse.  Consider that you've raised a kid to 10 years old.  A little boy.  Dan.  Dan is your life.  You love Dan with all your heart.  Every day, you can't wait to get home and spend time with Dan.  And then, right after Dan's 10th birthday, your wife says she wants a divorce.  And that Dan isn't really your kid, and here's a test that proves that, and she's moving in with Dan's real father, and that she's going to ask the Court to forbid you to ever see Dan again.  Now, THAT sucks every bit as bad as paying child support for a kid that isn't yours.  And there's basically no way to write the rules so that neither of these things happen; one of those scenarios basically HAS TO happen.  "

"My mom has been fighting HOA over an umbrella. The whole community HAS to have a tan umbrella on their deck.  Not blue, not green, TAN.    


Back story. Now, she lives in a well-to-do area in a $600,000+ condo, where the actual houses are over a million to 10 million dollars. The whole thing is on a golf course. So HOA is in full Nazi mode there.  




When she bought the land, she wanted to build a custom condo in the allotted space. So she did just that, which pissed off HOA something awful, but she agreed to have the same siding and the same window shutters and the same door lock, so it looked identical on the outside, but on the inside it was a paradise. She is the only condo that has a basement, and she swears HOA doesn't know she put in a basement.     


So she has a blue umbrella on her deck and she's sitting under it when she sees HOA drive past the cul-de-sac behind the deck and shortly after she hears the knocking on the door.  ""Peeglit's mom, you can't have a blue umbrella. You'll get a $300 fine unless you remove it."" Mom says, sure, and leaves it up.  This happens several more times until they finally come and physically remove it from the house.  She allowed them to do it, because little do they know, she's got all the plans to enclose a deck and make a four-seasons room out of it, which definitely isn't allowed, but she doesn't care.       


Edit: my mom isn't a bitch, she's actually hilarious so fuck you to whoever called her a bitch.  This HOA tries to tell you what kinds of dogs you can have and they can only be ""fancy"" dogs.  Literally nobody, save for a few families who don't even really speak English, follows the rules, and there's like over 300 homes in the community. HOA knows they're dumb and in over 12 years they have threatened the shit out of people and not once has anyone gone to court or lost their homes. It's been a long troll on HOA to give up on everyone's part and it's actually working, and it's actually pretty funny.  "

"My mother did something similar. I think you might have been confused on the scam your mom was trying to run.

When the court is looking at assets and splitting them, they will take into account the current assets and each party can argue for why they should get some things over others. A big part of that is who the property was originally bought for.

In my parents case, my mother listed all of the assets she could think of an overvalued them. 10 year old stereo system? The value was listed as the price it was originally purchased for. 

One thing she did was value the antiques they owned as far over what they were actually worth. I only found that out because I had the antiques appraised for my father, and I coincidentally went to the same appraiser my mother had gone to. 

Anyways, what you try and do is create as much on paper value for the property as you can, and then argue that you shouldn't get any of the property (or should only get the liquid property). This creates a huge imbalance because one person takes on property that is extremely overvalued and not liquid but on paper it will look like a 50% split.

For example, husband bets $100k in assets (antiques, etc) actually worth $25k, wife gets $100k in cash. 

How this is allowed to happen, I don't know, but it does.

The judge in my parents case went further. There was real estate that needed to be divided up. The judge gave my father one piece of real estate on which the market value was much less than the one he gave my mom. The judge justified it by saying that he used potential market value in the future to make it equitable.

That is, my mom got the property worth $1mil today, and my dad got one worth $500k - and the judge called it fair because according to him the $500k property could be worth $1mil in the future.

My dad appealed that all the way to the Supreme Court and it was overturned, you can't just make up a future value, you have to use current market value.

What's even crazier is that judge can impute income on people to support the alimony they are ordered to pay. Presumably this is to prevent people from stopping working to get out of paying alimony. The problem is that it can be abused easily by bad judges.

My dad made the vast majority of his money from a lawsuit his company was involved in. It was a single, one time multi-million dollar distribution he received.

The judge used all of the money he made + what he made in that lawsuit to determine what his income was for the purposes of alimony.

My dad was making about $100k a year from his salary and distribution from investments. 

The judge imputed $400k a year income for the purposes of alimony, which meant my dad was paying literally every dollar he made to my mom in alimony.

You are only allowed to dispute that number after a year, and only once a year. 

After the original judges order was overturned by the supreme court, my dad got a much more reasonable judge who was actually going to try and make an equitable decision. My mother saw the writing on the wall, and together with my dad we offered her a bunch of money as a settlement because she had already sapped 5 years of our lives litigating the divorce and putting our dad through hell. She took the settlement and my dad is now free of any obligations to her. 

Edit:

I forgot to mention that the judge also gave my dad all of the debt and my mother none of it. Debt that he took on while they were married to start the company that eventually allowed him to make all of the money to buy all of the stuff my mom ended up getting in the settlement. 

There are a myriad of ways judges can screw people while keeping it ""equitable"" on paper.  "

"Oh shit, I've actually kind of got one for this. 

Back in the day I used to tell my best friend/roommate that if neither of us were married by the time he turned 40, we should totally get married. It was mostly a joke, I had a bit of a crush on him. But, at the time I was in a relationship I thought would end in mariage, It didn't. I realized that I was actually in love my best friend and broke off the relationship. I didn't have the guts to tell him why I'd broken up with my boyfriend(until a couple days ago), so I moved out. I kind of kept that pact in the back of my mind the next couple of years. 

We finally realized that we both legitimately had feelings for each other a couple of months ago. So far it's been the best relationship I've ever been in, and I seriously hope I get to spend the rest of my life with this man. 

So, in a weird way our pact kind of worked out, it's just a couple years ahead of schedule.

"That my grandfather is actually my half-grand-uncle and my half-grand-uncle is my grandfather because my grandmother is a lying hoe. (But for the story's sake so I don't have to keep writing out 'half-grand-uncle. We'll just say uncle.)

I must explain this first. My grandma doesn't believe in having babies for love, she has babies to trap a man. She had my uncle at 14 to trap my grandfather (lets name him Dave) to get away from her psychopathic mother. Dave loved her way more than she deserved and treated her like a queen while she treated him like shit.

After my uncle was born, my Dave had to work as a mechanic at 16 to support her, they didn't have a house yet, so they stayed with Dave's mother and her youngest two sons. Dave's mother had been widowed right after Dave was born and remarried to another man and had a son as well so this guy we will call Mark, is Dave's half brother... He's 14. 

Boys imagine if you will for a moment, your brother's wife who looks like a model and is 21, begins to seduce you at 14 in a time period where sex ed and safe sex is not taught. How do you think you would react? While her husband was away, she was at home getting her 'fix' off a teenage boy who didn't know any better.

Once he grew older (about 16) he began seeing another woman and realized this thing he had with my grandma was wrong on so many levels and was about to leave her... Only to find out she'd quit her birth control to get pregnant on purpose to try and trap him to leave Dave for Mark.

Well... Mark gets the other girl pregnant as well within two weeks. And is given an ultimatum by hoe grandma. 'me or her.' Smart man chooses the other woman, completely against Gma's expectations. 

So now Grandma's fucked. Then she gets the wise idea to tell Dave the baby is his and torture Mark with it. For 39 years. Meanwhile, Dave and Grandma divorce and Grandma gets custody of the daughter (my mother) and refuses to allow Dave to see what he thinks is his daughter and keeps leaching his money through child support on a kid that isn't his. Holding that fact hostage for if she were to ever lose a custody battle as Dave took her to court literally every year to try and win custody back. 

Dave spent every dime he had trying to get his daughter back. And once she was 18 she moved the fuck away from crazy bitch mother and went right back to him. None of us knew untill Mark, having taken the stress of the situation hard as hell for the last 39 years, was dying of heart problems. 

He told my mother on his deathbed. She later told me when I was 16 and my Grandpa now knows... and he had mercy on her. He still allows her to live in his house and stuff. However he doesn't know I know. It'd break his heart if he thought I knew. He's still my grandpa to me.

Edit: Someone pointed out to me that 'Mark' would be my half-grand-uncle. So yeah. My grandfather is what we thought was my half-grand-uncle turned out to be my grandpa."

There have been instances where the government tested helmets from cheap Chinese suppliers and found those to be woefully non-compliant. Unfortunately, all they can really do is demand a recall of the defective helmets and, possibly, fine the companies, but those companies just shut down and come back under another name. Plus, the government doesn't have the resources to test anything more than a very small percentage of helmets to ensure compliance.

"Omg!! You just reminded me of something that happened to my brother when he was younger! 

I have brothers who are identical twins who shared a room. One night when my family got home late from a wedding my brother went to bed and got into the bottom bunk. His twin was in the bathroom. Something started pulling on his bankets. Like a force from under the bed starting pulling his blankets under the bed and he freaked out. He said he stood on the bed and got a good ""leap"" where he leaped out of the door and ran to my moms room. My mom and dad were showering and they ran out and went look under my brothers bed and they didn't find anything but my brother was so scared and he wasn't the lying type so my mom made him and my other brother, and my sister sleep in their room that night. (My parents had lived in a very haunted house before this so they were kind of scared about what was happening) 

Anyways- About a week later that house got completely robbed. They found out their cousin robed the place. Charges were filed, they got most of their stuff back. But no spooky things happened again. The bed pulling incident was forgotten UNTIL like 10 years later the cousin who robbed them apologized and told my dad this story about how a week before he robbed them he actually broke in to try to rob them while they were at a wedding but they returned while he was in the house so he hid under the bed and then my brother came in the room so he pulled the covers to scare him and when my brother ran out the room he escaped through the sliding glass door. 

So all those years my brother believed in a ghost under the bed when it was just our crackhead cousin. Haha.

I look up from my phone, and what do I see?


Through the gap in between the stall door and partition, there is a man staring at me while holding his flaccid penis.  We hold eye contact for a split second, then I put my phone back in its stereotypical 2000's nerdy holster.  At that point, the guy zips up his pants and bolts.  I wipe my ass, wash my hands, and dart out the bathroom.  Never found the guy, and I was paranoid about shitting in public for 6 months."

"I worked while she was in med school. When she did her residency, I took a full time job I hated because the hours allowed me to take care of our child literally every morning, night, weekend, and every single school vacation day. I also did everything in the house, she had no responsibilities other than training. The light at the end of the tunnel was that after a decade+ of this type of lifestyle, we would be very well off financially and everything would be ""perfect."" Except, as soon as she started making big doctor money, she moved out because she was unhappy, failing to mention that she was moving in with her section chief, lol. Now I'm in my late 30s, mediocre job with big gaps in work history, very few friends due to multiple moves, and really don't see how I could trust someone again after such a severe violation."

"Probably wouldn't be too scary now, but a few years ago I was in a hotel room. The ""room"" was actually two separate rooms, my parents were in one while my siblings and I were in the other.

In the middle of the night, I hear the bathroom door handle moving, so I look over to the door and can't see anyone, so I shrug it of and try to go back to sleep. A few seconds later I heard light footsteps coming towards me, but I'm almost asleep so I ignore them.

Just before I drift back to sleep, I feel an ice cold hand touch my neck. I sat up quickly out of panic to see what had touched me. As I turn, I hear a young child's voice saying ""It won't open"".

It was my sister, who was about 4 or 5 at the time. She needed to go to toilet but couldn't open the door, so I had to get up and open it for her. The worst part? When she came out she got into my bed, so I had to sleep on the floor that night.

I was at school feeling like shit, when I felt I was gonna puke and told the teacher. Midway to the bathroom I puked.

No idea why, maybe I didn't want the janitor to clean my puke, but I puked in my hands. Some got on the ground anyway.

Went back to the teacher with puke in hands, and showed her, told me to go to bathroom and ""what the fuck are you doing"" my words not hers, but clearly what she wanted to say.

Second Story, my gma and ma would put spoons on my stomach as a joke, had to explain the ball wasnt a magnet each time.

Third story, knew it was out of my system when I heard a feint ""tink"" in the toilet.

So me and my party are on the road, a barbarian, a druid and me the rogue. I'm on my freshly bought horse and everyone else on the cart. 

We come across a roadblock so everyone disembarks to check it out. I know where this is going, there's goblins or worse out there, so I give my new steed a slap to go hide in the woods to save him getting murdered by the DM.

Of course what follows was a battle, we win and everything's calmed down.

I whistle for my horse to come back when the DM points out to me that I've only owned the horse 5 minutes. He's long gone and I'll just have to get on the cart, can't argue with that logic.

But wait, we have a Druid.

I convince him to turn in to a horse and shout him back or something, I don't know how horses communicate.

The DM seizes the opportunity, it's a mating call.

My stallion comes running back in a lust fuelled rage. The Druid is frantically trying to turn back to elf form. What followed is probably the best thing I'll ever hear in a roleplaying game:

""Roll for penetration"" 

We haven't played since.

TLDR: my friend got butt fucked by a horse while me and a barbarian watched and laughed."

I was wrong about sea trade, smaller gulfs can easily bypass other regions by sailing. Land routes would be the predominant method of transporting goods and people up until we realized sailing down the coasts to port cities was much faster. It would be interesting to see naval development in this world, because sailing out into the great blue unknown would be a mere fancy with no practical purpose besides curiosity. We might see far more conservative ship designs that aren't suited to crossing deep oceans in favor of skirting the coastlines."

"When I was stationed at Fort Hood, a handful a guys from my unit (including me) were chosen to be lifeguard for the public pools on Fort Hood and for the area of Lake Belton's beach that Fort Hood was in charge of. 

For the first half of the summer, I worked the afternoon shift. I showed up with everyone else on my shift and walked over to one of the stands to relieve that guy. While walking over, I scanned the water just to be sure. I saw a kid who was struggling, but he had an adult next to him so I wasn't *too* concerned. I walked out to the water, and stood there for a second, scanning the water but paying attention to that kid. 

Then, that adult starts screaming ""he's drowning."" and I go out, get the kid on the red floatie thing (can't remember what it's called, it been a couple years) and bring him back to shore. He was fine, just pressed his luck trying to test his swimming skills. The adult was actually a teenage brother who also was a weak swimmer.

The point of saying all that is that when I looked up expecting the other soldier/lifeguard to be off of his stand and next to us, he was passed the fuck out. He was leaning so far to the right I'm surprised he didn't fall the fuck out of the chair.

I was a Corporal/CPL at the time and that guy was a Specialist/SPC. Same pay grade, different rank. As a CPL, I had authority over him and boy did I fucking use that authority that day. I became his personal trainer for a few hours and he was suppose to be off work around 1:30/2pm but I made him stay on shift until 7:30pm because of that. It was sweeter for me because it was a Friday and I knew he had plans that night. Not anymore, dickhead.  "

So it goes:

P1: Do you want pizza, burritos, or Thai for dinner?

P2: I don't really want pizza, it's too heavy

P1: Ok, well then, let's do burritos. 

P2: sweet. 

That way everyone has had input into the decision, so no one feels like they're forcing the other to do it their way, and the dinner problem is solved in less than a minute."

"Technically we weren't in a relationship, we were supposed to be working together on a creative project, he just liked to pretend we were to complete strangers and I didn't realize he was doing that until I finally got him out of my life. There were many red flags, but I was a very sheltered and naive girl so most of them were shrugged off. Looking back now I shudder. 

So aside from the whole pretending-I-was-his-girlfriend thing there was also:

* The long distance relationship he had with a 17 year old (who looked about 13) Indonesian girl that was clearly exploitative. He was nearly 30. She was terrified of him because he talked all the time about sex or violence or both. 

* All of the books, comics and films he liked had huge amounts of violence towards women. He worshipped Frank Miller. His own stories were nothing but dead women and the breasts of dead women. 

*When I scrambled to fix artwork that he had screwed up before a deadline, he left me stranded in a city I had never been to before after midnight during an active bomb threat. He was supposed to pick me up but instead the police did because everyone in the city had gone indoors. 

*Engineered many situations for us to share a bed. Was visibly annoyed when I found somewhere else to sleep. 

*Talked a lot about my body to random people, including potential customers. Bragged that I was using low cut tops to bring in sales (I wasn't, I was practically Amish in how I dressed at the time.)

*Had a massive hate boner for his best friend's wife (who was always lovely to me.) Talked about their sex life in excruciating detail. 

*All relationships he had while I knew him were with vulnerable women way out of his league. They tended to break up with him after meeting me because I showed actual interest in their lives, and he got very grabby with them in front of me. I cockblocked him hard without realizing it. 

*Introduced me to his 'best friend', a fifty year old pothead with a Dr Who obsession who treated him with open contempt and propositioned me twice. We spent days in his house where he smoked hash non-stop, I must have been coming home stinking of the stuff. I don't know how or why my parents didn't pick up on it. 

*Walked in on me changing so many times I lost count. 

* 'Accidentally' left porn in the DVD player and let it play for quite some time before switching it off. 

*Was probably wolf otherkin. Obsessed with being 'the lone wolf' and 'the big bad wolf.' 

*Confessed his 'feelings' to a mutual friend the day after she turned 18. 

*Left incest porn lying around. 

*Hated every aspect of Asian culture except for its 'submissive' women. 

* Bragged about punching a guard dog. 

*Reacted to me cutting him out of my life by leaving the country. Has not been back since, as far as I know. 

That's what I can remember off the top of my head, there's probably more."

I foresee a slow, gradual, secret collapse, followed by a big public ""the sky is falling, we can all panic now"" collapse once it's 90% over, of the American film industry. Obviously this won't be permanent, but it'll lead to a noticeable change in trends from current movies compared to movies of the future.

Basically, extrapolating current trends, films will continue to get bigger and louder and longer and bluer and oranger and grayer and more CGI-filled to appeal to international audiences, and after a certain point, this will see diminishing returns in the USA.

A lot of people don't realize that the special effects industry has razor-thin profit margins. By now none of the ones doing work for summer blockbusters are independent, and none of them are based in the USA anymore. Studios farm out individual scenes in the script to lowest bidders. Again, doing a little bit of pessimistic extrapolating, we're going to see a diminishing returns effect - the barrier of entry for CGI work gets lower and lower, employees are treated and paid progressively worse. The ""rules"" for how cheap and modular CGI assets can be slapped together will become more hardened and calcified, resulting in increasingly homogeneous, identical-looking movies, and more mistakes will slip through the cracks into the finished products, and eventually audiences will take note once making fun of these mistakes becomes a common thing.

Audience tastes will simply change, and because these films have gotten simultaneously so expensive and yet so disposable, there will be no real studio ""backup plan"" in place once audiences stop watching the millionth superhero laser-going-up-in-the-sky movie around...oh, I'm gonna say around 2025 or so.

Essentially, it'll end up like the dot com bubble, for movies."
"Judy Garland is a really sad case. Her parents basically forced all the kids into show business as babies, put them in training and such. Once she became famous all the studio cared about was money. They gave her a pill to sleep, another to wake up, and some to stay awake throughout the day. She became addicted of course. They constantly told her she was ugly, because she was considered a ""girl next door"" type of look, when she was surrounded by girls like Liz Taylor, women who were renowned for their beauty. Then as is the story with most actresses of that day, her contract expired, they let her go, and she was unable to get any more work, since her ""only"" skill was acting singing and dancing. Its noted one of the reasons she became so famous is because at as young as 13 she had the voice of a grown woman. Her ex husband accused the munchkins of molesting her, but theres not exactly solid evidence. Not that sexual abuse isnt rampant in the industry, it is."

Then they noticed that part of my kneecap was missing, then they took another x ray a day later and more was missing.

Now they were really freaked and moved me into complete isolation and everyone who came in had to wear protective suits.

They took a whole bunch of samples and nothing came back positive. Through out this my kneecap kept disappearing.

I was kept in isolation for a two weeks, when suddenly it just stopped. The swelling went away and my kneecap stopped disappearing.

I went one weekend with a group of friends and about half through the tour while in one of the hotel rooms my stomach begins to cramp up badly but I dont say anything at the time. About a minute later the tour guide shares that the former patron of the room  performed illegal abortions there and was murdered by the boyfriend of one of the girls he operated on. The guide went on to share that women on past tours had reported stabbing stomach pains when in that room. Freaked me the hell out.

My solution to that is to stand well back and watch my bag approaching then utter several loud excuse me's as I move toward the scrum packed belt. I then grab my bag and lift it off in whatever space has failed to emerge. I do lift slowly and make sure I have planned my attack run amongst relatively fit and mobile people. They move.

"I fly a lot with United and on long-haul wide body planes, they usually don't have enough carry-on space, since the planes weren't designed to have 100% non-check capacity. Recently I was watching the boarding process and they were enforcing the ""use the checker thing"" for everyone. One woman scanned her ticket and the agent told her to use the checker because her suitcase clearly looked too big. 

""Oh, it'll fit"" she said as she breezed past the checker, clearly thinking she was going to get around the restriction. 

The agent whirled around and told the woman to stop and size her bag. She pretended not to hear him and continued to the jetway. He then walked over to her and said you need to check the bag or you're not boarding. She protested and said I'm not doing that and tried to turn away from him. ""Molly, you in danger girl.""

""I'm sorry ma'am, but you're not going on this flight. I'm going to have to ask you to leave"" and was holding her bag so she couldn't move it. 

At this point she was now bright red and said fine, I'll size the bag.  Nope, sorry. ""I asked you twice to size or check your bag and you refused. Please stand aside."" She's now trying to shove her bag into the sizer, clearly failing since it was too big and having a fit. The agent ignored her and kept boarding passengers. 

She ended up checking the bag and boarding last, but god it was heaven to see her get put in her place for trying to break the rules and be a jerk.

Go rent two adjoining hotel suites at a 4 star hotel. For the year. Including all room service.

You can live off of the other $270k *probably* for the year...

Great food prepared by chefs, two clean hotel suites to use for a year, you now have $5 billion to buy the hotel when you're done and burn it down. Because fuck that place.

* It takes like two months (anybody correct me if I've got the timeline wrong) to build a foetus up in there.  
* When you do have a foetus up in you, it's not in your cunt (although it may pass through there during birth).
* Plan B is a great option if you need to prevent unwanted pregnancy after unprotected penis-in-vagina intercourse, but it's not a good choice for your normal birth control, and it does NOT prevent STI/HIV infection.  If you may have been exposed to HIV, you need to see a healthcare professional and should ask about medications that can prevent you from becoming infected.

My graduate degree is in thermodynamics. I model different types of supercritical, hydrocarbon extractions and develop processes to make new types of hash &amp; distilled THC.

"Problems were already piling up and then we had a pregnancy scare 

She immediately said that if she really was pregnant she'd move to Minnesota to live with her dad while I saved up money so we could get a place near her family there, she insisted that things would be better with family support. 

The only problem was the entire side of her family that lives in Minnesota was racist, and I'm black. Her father always refused to meet me because I was black despite dating his daughter for three years. Her mom's side loved me, but I never met her dad. 

She insisted that it would be completely reasonable to raise our future multi racial child around her racist family that regularly referred to me as the n word whenever she went to visit. 

To top it all off it turned out it wasn't a birth control failure that caused all of this. She stopped taking her birth control for a few weeks because she thought that showering after unprotected sex was a valid form of birth control. Meaning that we had unprotected sex multiple times without her on the pill. 

Thankfully after 2 months of arguing we finally confirmed she wasn't pregnant and was just having incredibly irregular cycles due to stress. 

We broke up after that. That whole event showed me that she wasn't nearly as mature as I thought she was and was also somehow oblivious enough to think that exposing her child to hatred was fine. "

"&gt; being close friends with people who would happily cheat either

This is a very durable litmus test for friendship. It's never led me wrong. If you have a friend who talks about cheating with anything less than deep remorse, get that person out of your life at once. You aren't missing a damn thing. There's 7 billion people in the world, we can all afford to be choosy with our friends. Let the cheaters of the world stew in their own juices together, they all deserve each other."
"Had a brief thing with this girl who was in highschool when i was in 8th grade. Found out shortly after she had a boyfriend of 3 years. I told her we couldnt continue but if there was an issue with her boyfriend when it was dealt with i would be open to dating her... well she never broke up with him and instead actively stalked me. She knew where i would skate at the time and she would hide in the woods and text me saying shit like ""so you cant meet up with me but you can skate with your friends at ___"" i blocked her on social media and ignored her calls and texts, and she continued to do so daily for about 3 months. Dodged a bullet 

Slightly different but this other girl i dated off and on for a year. This girl completely fucked me up. She talked me into a suicide attempt because she was sick of hearing me complain.keep in mind I was in a really tough spot with my depression too. I was always cautious when i would date her again but every time it was the same damn trap i fell for. The moment i would show i was interested in her she would break up with me. The final straw was when she did that for probably the 6th time and i knew i would fall for it again so instead of trying to talk about feeling i told her to fuck off and punched her wall. Was it immature? Absolutely, but it got the job done. It ended it entirely and she never wanted to get back together.

Unfortunately for me, she started a rumor that I was the emotionally and physically abusive one, and that i had raped her. I lost most of my friends and I went from a popular guy to someone who is still to this day avoided like the plague. Even the friends i still have dont believe me entirely. They dont think she tried to talk me into suicide but they believe im not a rapist/abuser. Reason why I'm sharing this second story is for anyone out there who spots a red flag, DONT FUCKING IGNORE IT"

"I had this happen to me, although I wasn't married. With my girlfriend for 2ish years. Kinda on and off at the time. She gets pregnant around one of those off times. But she says it's mine, never really felt 100% right to me, always doubts, not really ready for kids especially with her, but ohh well, man up. Get an apartment and move in together, get the place all set up, all the baby showers and stuff. Kid comes out dark hair, both her and I were blonde babies. Odd but I have brown hair so maybee. He's a little tanish but babies are all weird colors when their born anyways, and he was jaundice so yellowish. I sign the birth certificate at the hospital, shouldn't have before a test in hindsight, but wanted to do the right thing and I was 3 days in the hospital at that point and sleep deprived. Baby gets my last name. We go home. a couple weeks later and jaundice clears up. Baby's got a tan for sure now, We are both white, hes got some mexican in him. Doubts were always there and I had told her from the beginning I wanted a paternity test, Just for the peace of mind knowing he was mine without a doubt, she didnt object. So two weeks after hes born I take him down for the test, another two weeks and I get an email with the results, 99% not mine. Not sure how to describe the feeling when I didn't really want kids, but had already fallen in love with the little guy, odd conflicting emotions at the results. My mom took it the hardest, she was the last one of all her friends to become a grandma, she was excited, and the test took that away from her, she cried for days. I called a lawyer for a consultation that day. Because I signed the birth certificate I had waived my rights to a paternity test according to what I signed so I was freaking out. Don't want to be stuck paying support on a kid that's not mine. A second lawyer took my case, GF worked with me and went to the lawyer with me. We eventually had to go to court to have a judge allow me off the birth certificate, Judge basically left it up to the GF, she said that's what she wanted, had she not i'm 90% sure I'd be stuck. They tend to side with the mother. Lawyer court costs ended up about $3000. Removed my name and changed his last name to hers all on the same form. I lived with them for the remainder of my lease, 9ish months then moved back home. He's 2.5 now, I still see him about once a week and take him to do fun things. Not sure where it will end up. We were all civil about the whole thing, I never freaked out or yelled or fought or anything, It was more like, well this sucks, lets deal with it. We worked through it together. If you are ever in this situation I highly advise getting a paternity test first. If you have any doubt at all get the test, Its $300 for absolute peace of mind. You can sign the birth certificate at any time, even months or years later. It Would have made it so much easier avoiding all the lawyer and court's. Also, the sooner the better, If you wait till the kid is two and you've been his dad that whole time your probably going to be his dad forever in the states eyes. "

"So, this story might sound like bullshit to some, but i swear it happened.   
well, enter the scene: My cousin, a pair of mutual friends, and of course, me. It was a lovely summer night, a pair of years ago, and we were in the middle of nowhere in a swampy-ass forest setting up a camp. We really like camping, even though the entire group that was there at the time was the sort of peeps to stay 40 hours awake staring at screens and playing videogames. So, we were there, chilling as we lit up a small fire too cook marshmallows over, we were sharing stories and fucking around when suddenly.... we hear some rat-like noises, and being the stupid fucks we were, we decided to go check it out, with a pair of sticks and stuff in case it actually was a big one.

so, after my horrible luck decided that I was gonna have to be the one to carry the flashlight, we set out, and it wasn't 10 minutes until we reached some sort of small lake, not seeing anything, i begin swiping the flashlight around in search of whatever was making the noise.  
then we see it, or more accurately, them. a whole bunch of [coypus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coypu) straight up like 12 of them, staring directly at us. i've seen these guys before, they're like huge rat-beavers, and they aren't really that aggressive. but they're territorial. Before we had a chance to back off, the whole group began to swim towards us, and we had to High tail it out of there, sticks or no sticks, i wouldn't give my chance against a group of angry beaver rats with orange teeth.

Long story short, we were chased back to camp by coypus, and from the camp, we had to grab everything in a hurry and get the hell out of there.

"Everyone thinks their issues are unique.  I can't tell most patients this, but I've heard everything they said a dozen times before.  Sometimes I find myself thinking individuality is the biggest lie humans are told.  Not everyone is the same, rather, we are cut from a few dozen cloths, and as a result everyone has several dozen millions of other people out there who share a strikingly similar thoughts, feelings, identities, and life stories.

For some patents realizing this is a benefit that takes a great weight off of them.  For others, the notion that they are an individual is one of the only things holding them together.  Two different cloths.  The latter nurturing that feeling for is very important.

Tangently related, I have often joking thought about making patient bingo cards for my own amusement.  Though for obvious reasons I don't; it would be disrespectful and lead to bad practices.  It is far too important to make sure I don't overlook a nuance amoung all the dejavu.

It probably wasn't a lawyer stating the pseudo physics, but the defendant, obviously falsely, recalling events to make it appear that they were in the right. I believe he said that the defendant had said that they deflected off of one car and into another."

The family friend had no children my age, but they had a big back yard that was a hill that was pretty good sized, say 500 feet tall with lots of trees. A small mountain to a kid. There where some trails that went up to the top. There where also some water tanks and various county pump sheds. So one day I'm over there and go to the back to roam around up the hill. And on the path I see one of the water tanks (about 20 feet tall and 40 feets wide) and as I get close I see a person laying over the edge. They looked dead because he was all green and blue. I went back and told the adults but they didn't believe me. The next day they called my parents and told them I was right and that some guy and committed suicide on top of the tank. Anyway it was pretty freaky and had nightmares about it."

"While I did not interview this person, a coworker did show me a candidate's resume. It was about 11 pages and was mostly the author recounting some accusations she went through. For example, several pages in a row would be her telling the story of how she got accused of something, but it was actually the other person's fault. 11 pages of rambling. "

"My ex's family treated his dog horribly, always putting her in the basement with the lights off and yelling at her for practically everything (even though she just was a pup and wanted attention). His grandpa seemed to be one of the worst offenders, saying she had rabbies, putting her outside in bad weather, etc. I always tried to give her as much attention as I could when I was there. When everybody was upstairs, I'd go in the kitchen and take food out of his grandpa's lunchbox that he packed for the next days work and put some of it on the dishes they eat out of and let her enjoy some nice home cooked meals. After she was done licking the plates, I'd put them back on the shelf.

"I worked somewhere where the President's admin had worked with him for decades.  He adored her, she ran the ship professionally and efficiently.

Similar thing happened to me. I was body boarding in ~8-10' waves and I caught a wave too late and it dumped me over with it. I felt like it held me under forever (Was probably like 5-10 seconds in reality) and while spinning me around like I was in a washing machine it ripped my board off my leash. When it finally passed by I find my way to the surface just to find another wave crashing down on top of me. This happened 3 or 4 more times and by the last one I don't think I could have taken anymore waves. It finally pushed me far enough past where the waves were breaking and I was able to barely swim back to shore. I just laid on the beach for 15 minutes shaking realizing I almost died. It was only me and my friend out there at the time and he was too far away to see what was happening.

"Shortly after my now-husband and I started dating, I was staying at his apartment while he was at work. He worked either until 2 a.m. or 7 a.m., so I was always there alone overnights. It never bothered me much; I would go to bed when he left, and he'd crawl in with me when he got home.

One night, I felt someone crawl in and curl up with me. I thought nothing of it; I just assumed my guy was home from work. Fast forward a couple hours when I get up for work and find that I'm alone. As I walked out of the bedroom, my guy was just walking through the back door. He looked extremely puzzled and asked why the back door was open. I said I had no idea. That's when I noticed the front door was also ajar.

Keep this in mind: the apartment was on the second floor of a giant old house. There was an apartment that shared the top floor with us and two smaller apartments downstairs. There were two ways to get into our apartment: the back door from outside that entered into the kitchen OR a door that entered right next to the bedroom door that came up from a stairwell from the front of the house. We always used the back door. The front door stayed locked at all times with a hook-and-eye lock and the lock on the knob itself.

Three years later, I have no idea who crawled in bed with me that night. All I know is that the back door was open, the front door was open, and nothing was missing from the apartment. 

Further, when we moved into the apartment we live in now, we were gone and came home to find the basement door was open (no outside access to said door), nothing was missing from the place, and the front door was still locked with the deadbolt. "

"ALSO not a divorce​ lawyer, happened with my parents. 

Backstory: My father was married once before, but after suffering a brain aneurysm him and his wife calmly decided to split; in fact when he woke up after his surgery he didn't even know who she was, and the recuperation was just too stressful on their marriage. 

A little while later a shitbag med student and drug addict who used her charms, passive aggressiveness and generally assholey buy charismatic personality to manipulate people into doing what she wanted for years (also known as my mother) met up with him. They're married for a pretty long time; they've both been married and divorced, and she still has two kids living with her who kind of resent my dad because he wasn't their actual dad, yada yada yada, I get that. 

But after those two move out and they have two new kids, their marriage gets strained. My mother isn't an addict anymore; but she IS still a massive pile of shit. They get divorced and for I think 8 years (maybe shorter, maybe longer) they both Duke it in court; my mother constantly trying to fuck him over as much as possible. 

She never got custody; me and my brother went back and forth, staying a week at one house then a week at the other. My father was left with no money and since noone would hire him  because ofhe aphasia he was left with after the aneurysm, no job. (Up until the divorce my mother, being a doctor, made the money while my dad looked after me and my brother.) So he was royally screwed. 

Just last week, a long time after the divorce ended, I helped him move out of his house; which I grew up in; so he could go and live in his mother's (my grandma's) house. Luckily she isn't there most of the time, since she generally stays in New Jersey through the spring and summer; but it's still humiliating and depressing that on top of still being unemployed he now has to live with his mother to avoid going homeless.

"I actually was very depressed (it started before when I was around 8 or so cause I was bullied)and stopped going to my new school ,just strolling around with no real goal or purpose. On day I cut my hair pretty badly cause my mom was throwing a fit  about me being so boring and quiet.
She just called my aunt to fix it up and I couldn't take it anymore,I was just a puppet for them. So I went to child protection,sitting in the building for hours,gathering my confidence. Then finally a lady was available and I told her I couldn't take it anymore. I remember how she looked at me, studying me and saying:
""This is very important now,girl. Does your mother hurt you? Physically?""
I said no,she never did.
""Then""the lady sighed.""We can't do anything.Go home.Or to school.""

I gathered my thoughts for a couple of days,then I made a plan. I went to a lively shopping street,go into a building,climbed on the backyard and onto a garage and waited for someone to see me. I didn't really want to jump but I knew I needed attention. And I got it. Police came, ambulance brought me to hospital.

My mom came, screaming at me,I don't remember much,she hit me square in  the face and left. I was brought to a mental hospital and stayed there for a few days until I was brought to a orphanage/child protection center where I stayed for a year or so as they tried to find a place for me.

Edit:The place itself was ok and I met a very good friend when I got to school again. The other kids...not so..they were all premature teenage girls sneaking out and drinking and to fit in I joined. Drank my first vodka at 12.

They were also friends with a popular drug dealer who took a liking in me as I was very intoxicated. He put something in my drink and ,oh well,let's just say he left me unconscious in a park and denied to ever have touched me. He was mid twenties and had a wife and daughter."

Towards the end I had gotten married and was getting ready to buy a house. I found out there was a $1000 balance that she still owed. So I just paid it off to officially close it out, and she paid me $84 a month for the next 12 months.

"Despite being a great character in the story, I feel like people don't really understand how tyrannical Daenerys really is. 

She was smiling when Khal Drogo was talking about sailing the narrow sea and raping and pillaging Westeros. When she takes her army of horse-lords over, they're not going to stand outside of a castle and have a clean battle to gain the iron throne, her massive mounted army of barbaric rapists are going to raid the countryside, killing, enslaving and raping families; just so she can gain the throne that she has no right to hold. Her dragons are going to burn cities and kill innocent people by the thousands. 

I don't understand anyone wanting her and Jon Snow to get together, she seems to literally be the exact opposite of the kind of character he is. She's a bloodthirsty tyrant. "

Was working at a chain bookstore in the same town that the CEO lived in, and he would frequently come in to our store to get things.

Had a customer blowing up at me over a return and that an exception should be made, because he ""knows the CEO really well, [they] go way back"". Not the first time I've heard similar things. It didn't help he got the CEO's first name wrong.

I wish I could have some sort of memento from this, but the CEO was in the store that day. The CEO was in the very line for the registers that annoying customer was holding up with demands to return something he didn't buy from us. 

I knew the customer was full of shit since they had the name wrong and ignored his ""good friend"" in line. So it was nice to ask why he didn't say anything to his pal, it was nice when the CEO came up to us at the registers to ask if they needed help, and it was nice to have two store managers stand there confirming that he *was* talking to the CEO and was caught in the lie of knowing the CEO to demand a return.

"My wife used to work at the ludicrously oversized mall in our town and I would drop her off every morning as we shared a car. The parking lots were completely empty at 7 AM so often I would roll through the stop signs and then drive faster than I would if other cars were present. 

One frigid winter morning a security truck begins following me. They have this spinning orange light atop the cab that is perpetually on. As I stop to let her out in front of the entrance the truck pulls up about 6"" from my rear bumper. The rent-a-cop who exited the vehicle must have weighed 350 lbs and he got out adjusting his flat brimmed hat and putting on mirrored sunglasses (it is still dark at 7 AM in the winter here).

As he waddled up to my drivers side window I stifled a laugh and rolled the window down.
""Do you have any idea how fast you were going back there?"" He asked.

""Yeah but you don't, there's no way you have a radar gun in there."" I answered pointing my thumb back at the white Ford Ranger he was driving.

He exhaled heavily to emphasize that his patience was running low. ""Yeeaahh... do you have a drivers license on you?""

""Yes I do.""

He stares at me with anticipation, expecting me to pull it out and hand it to him. I just look back at him as the silence begins to turn awkward. After about 2 minutes it finally dawns on him that he isn't the only participant in this conversation acutely aware that he is not a law enforcement officer. As the self satisfied look of authority drains from his face I narrow my eyes slightly and begin to nod.

""Yeah,"" is the last thing I say as I put the car in gear and speed away.

I was very pleased with that whole interaction until later that day when I picked up my wife. Apparently he waddled in after her and sternly told her that he would call the real police if he ever caught me driving recklessly on mall property again. I was furious and drove like a complete asshole for the next two weeks straight hoping for a chance to take him down a peg, but I never saw him again.

Also my wife correctly pointed out that the likely result would be him embarrassing her in front of her coworkers again. I let it go."

It took me ten solid years, writing a novel a year, before one sold, and that one has led to a career of writing. It was *hard*, and I often felt like giving up, mostly because I had ten years and ten novels that were rejected, adding up to about a thousand rejections. A thousand times someone told me no, I wasn't good enough. That eats at you. 

Now, though? Now I have my dream job, my entire family is with me all day, my kid is going to have a kick ass life. I write when I want to (but I make myself want to a lot). My daily schedule depends on my deadlines and my home life. I can take a month off and deal with family if I need to; I can lock myself in my office and write all day if I need to. I do well with deadlines and working in big bursts, so it works well for us.

No other explanation needed, and i accepted as the audience that the room just represented a glimpse at hell, which made it terrifying. There was no ""why"" to the room. There was on ""reason"" which meant the room/entity could not be reasoned with. This wasn't a movie where the character was going to discover the bones of a victim and end the haunting by ""setting the spirit free"" or whatever. **it was just an evil fucking room.** No logic, no reasoning, no negotiating.

"My dad and I were hunting in his tree stand when I was younger. I'm not big on hunting, but I liked spending time with my dad so I'd tag along. We were sitting there one chilly sunday morning in november when everything felt off. I was uneasy, and it felt like how I did when I knew I was doing something wrong. My dad keeps asking me if I'm bored yet or want to go home(which I kinda was and I did once that feeling crept up, but I didn't want him to think I was a weenie so I said no). Suddenly my dad tenses up behind me and lifts his gun up a little. I ask if he saw something and he shakes his head, staring off into the trees. After a few seconds I try to ask him again and shushes me, now looking straight up concerned. There's a loud rustling and snapping noise coming towards us now from all directions and I'm freaking out because if my dad looks this upset then we're both probably about to get eaten by werebears or something.

Suddenly like 200 gray squirrels bust into this little clearing we're in, scampering in all directions like some kind of furry little flash mob. They were everywhere, running every which way, flowing and pushing past each other in a panicked squirrel frenzy. Then just as quick as they showed up they were gone, and the feeling went with them. We waited for a bit and left. We still laugh about the great squirrel horde, though. "
"My parents bought a house in the mountains near national forest land around the time I was in 9th grade. I loved the woods and nature, so I would sneak out at night and walk through the forest all the time. A winter night in a forest in northern Utah is amazing. They can also be terrifying.

I later learned to identify some of the more common animal calls and cries, but at the time I knew nothing about any of that. So as I'm wandering alone through this forest one time I heard the most blood curdling and terrifying scream I have ever heard. I froze the second I heard it, lowered to the ground and didn't move for what seemed like forever. Eventually I heard some quiet scuffling and turned to see a fox run across the dry river bed near where I was. Scared the absolute shit out of me. If you've never heard a fox cry, it is the scream of nightmares.

"Came here to say this. :)

Southwest isn't for everyone. Semi-open seating isn't ideal for large groups or families, and the lack of on-board entertainment or luxuries isn't good for people with small children, or if you're on a *really* long flight.

But they have cheap flights, and fantastic customer service. The flight attendants are super friendly, and really look after kids or nervous fliers - I've been flying across 800 miles several times a year, alone, since I was 11-12 years old, and I've never once felt abandoned or alone on a flight. In the age of multitudes of portable media (laptops, tablets, phones, handheld gaming devices, etc.) there are increasingly many ways to entertain yourself (on top of the old favorites like magazines, puzzles, and books). And they still give you two checked-in bags for free! On top of that, Southwest was one of the first major airlines to not just support gay rights (I'm bi), but to actually advertise with the rainbow (before it was cool).

And while this may be just me, I feel like their website is a lot easier to use and book flights on than most other major airlines.

I know the airline isn't perfect, and has some problems, just like all airlines do. But out of all the major, commercial airlines, SWA is the best.

There are people who do need a lot of amenities - i.e. people on really long flights, families with small children, etc. But if you self-reliant and want a relaxed flying experience, I always tell people to go for Southwest. It's well worth the price.

I thought that was sick, but I carried on with it. I sent her a message on Facebook saying we took care of him when he lost the bus and she EXPLODED on me raging about how she was sure we were trying to steal him from her, that my cousin needed no family or friends, just her, and went on. 

I told her she was crazy. And also told my cousin he was dating a very damaged person. My cousing cut all ties with his friends and lived only with her and for her ever since. It's been almost ten years. 

Now he is a 30-year old drop out of college (because of her) living on a shitty stinking apartment full of pets (she now has this craze about rabbits and hamsters, has tons of them) playing League of Legends all day. "
"Doesn't bum me out at all to see an unstable, selfish person not also responsible for a kid. :) She'd have my sympathy if it was a miscarriage (to a degree; drinking while you're pregnant is a bad idea whether you want the kid or not) but I can think of people likely better suited to raising a child than someone seeking attention at someone else's wedding reception, too."
"&gt; So, storytime. I was at a party in late December, grinding hard on this manlady, blasted off my mind, and next thing I know she/he turns around unzips my JNCOs and starts finagling my wang. Best night ever. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I jizzed on em and the stain is actually pretty hard to get off after a few months. All in all though, quality pair of jeans.

thank you for that"
"Of course not, that would be gross"
"I'm a 90 pound female that cannot hang whatsoever. Im also heavily introverted and I think that's important here. So when my friend who was in college a year before invited me to a party with alcohol, I jumped at the opportunity to do whatever with her. (she was quite popular amongst, well.. everyone)

I, being 17, was eager to see what the college world was about. Beer pong and guitar hero was about it -- but I was elated! Drinks ensue. Many of those. First time drinking for me so we end up drunk at a party with about 5 other females and seemingly a thousand dudes.

*Before I get too into this I'd like to clarify it was my first college party and my first four Loko..*

Her and I are flirting. Which is odd because we've never done that before. Girls will do this sometimes to tease surrounding guys, so I went with the flow. Playing GH and before I know it, the current picks up and we're getting blurry.. we end up with two other girls in a bedroom and were talking about everything sex related, it comes up that I hadn't been with anyone.. I'll call her Allie. 

Allie thinks it's a tragedy that I've never gotten off at the hand of another before. Decides we need to fix this. Here. Now. ""Holy shit"" is all I'm thinking here.

So, naturally, Allie eats me out in front of two other girls touching on my every inch and a guy (who ventured out from mouthbreathing loud enough to notice as he watched from the closet) massaged my feet while she worked. It was basically magical and I fantasize about it nearly 10 years later. 

In closing, Allie and I were the craziest thing I've ever seen at a party. 

**tl;dr**: friend ate me out in front of strangers at a strangers' college party.  Also, the foot massage fetish struggle is so real. Thanks, guy.           "

don't get advice on our relationship from reddit
"Last year I was with my SO in the emergency waiting room waiting to see how a family member of his was. After about an hour he went t go see them and I told him I'd wait in the waiting room to give them some privacy. Anyway, a couple of minutes after he went, there was a bit of yelling coming from one of the checkup rooms (not sure what they're actually called), and this man comes out escorted by 3 or so security guards and he is dragging this pregnant woman out, they're trying to separate them and I find out he has refused to let the nurses examine her without hi present. The poor woman couldn't speak a word of english and this man was screaming that there was no way they would touch her without him there.

Turns out, about 5 of his family members were in the waiting room with me, and they quietly got up and attacked the security guards with knives. It was fucking SCARY and the place went into lockdown while we were told to get down to the ground and quickly escorted into a smaller room they could lock while the police came.

My SO came out an hour or so later with me shaking like a leaf. Sad thing is, apparently abuse and fights are normal in the ER. I had no idea."

"Aw man, this one really hurt my ego.  I used to participate in Piano competitions, and to qualify for ""trophy classes"" you had to do a sight reading category.

They'd pick an obscure piece at around a ~Grade 10 RCM level (for people unfamiliar with Piano, about a level of someone who'd have played for 10 years).  And each participant would wait in a side room.  One by one, we'd go out and each have a stab at the piece.  You'd have 1 minute to look through it, and then would have to play it for the judges.

So like one thing I'm really good at is sight reading.  It's just from years and years of mostly finding hard video game arrangements and making youtube videos of them.  Like to me it just feels like reading a book of normal words out loud, it just translates easily to the piano for me.  I'd do the same with classical, just like always bounce around between pieces, and just became very familiar and comfortable with different styles of writing.

I was 18 years old, in the ""open"" category, so a bunch of 18+ year old people.  There's also a 10 year old girl.

We each take our turns.

I got 2nd place, with an 88%.  10 Year old girl got 97%, with the additional comment ""one of the most outstanding interpretations of this piece I've ever heard in my career - you are an outstanding musician"".

My girlfriend was there and was like, ""wow good job babe!  But that little girl just hustled you"".  I just felt like such a loser.  Like growing up, people would always be like ""yoooo can you play this song?""  And I'd just kind of wing it by ear and get it, or just like find ANYTHING and just be able to play it well.  I go to this competition, and the girl (who also won EVERY other Category) just completely destroyed me, and I was kind of grouped up with the people who were all ""meh"" at sight reading.

It doesn't seem like much.  But like imagine spending like 12 years taking like Golf lessons, getting to a level where you feel you can compete.  You do well in competitions, but there's a 10 year old kid who on the first hole gets a hole in one, and gets like 8 under par.  You'd be like ""goddamn that kid!!!!""  like you don't want to be spiteful, but you're like ""why do you have to be so godly"""
"Plymouth. Fucking. Rock.

I went to an overly enthusiastic elementary school in Massachusetts. Every fucking field trip it was like, ""Hey kids, we're going to go see Plymouth Rock!"" and then we all got herded into a bus and sat there on our fourth grade asses for a few hours, and of course every single time at least one kid launched flaming shit missiles into his pants, one kid vomited ropes of vomit that seemed like more than could fit inside a fourth grader, as if we were actually on the godforsaken Mayflower and we had hit rough seas or some shit.

And then we finally got off the bus from hell and we all crowded around a cage with a rock in the bottom. A fancy-ass cage that looked like the cage Pythagoras or some old crusty Greek dude would keep his parakeet, but a cage with a rock in the bottom.
For the acrid smell of human feces that still persists in my nostrils eight years later and continues to kill my soul slowly, that better have been some magic, wish granting fucking rock.

But no. It's just a fucking rock.

"Crystals.  Seriously, damned near everything is a crystal and they are just rocks.  Yes, they're pretty, but they certainly don't have special powers, ""energy,"" or for fuck's sake ""souls"" living inside of them.  I was over at this hippie house a few years ago and they had a book there with a list of the special powers and uses that each crystal had cross-referenced with different risks and problems.

It said that onyx could protect against terrorist attacks.  What. The. Fuck.  I pointed this out to the hippies and things got a little heated.  Never mind that there were crystals in the room which supposedly had powers to prevent strife and frustration and conflict, which I also pointed out.

Another guy at a bar told me that he moved to this city (Asheville, which is famous for ridiculous shit like this) because there is a massive crystal underneath it that contains the souls of the super-beings (he implied they were telepathic aliens) who had lived in Atlantis, and that moving here allowed him to absorb these souls and gave him special powers as well.

Locals call them crystal-strokers.  You learn to just say ""uh huh.  Wow.""  It amazes me that some of these people pay thousands of dollars for pretty rocks, but then I remember that this isn't so rare - what's rare is believing that they have powers beyond making people love you because you spent that money on the rocks.

It's all a little discouraging to think about."

"Myself and 10 or so friends were spending the night at a house for a 12th birthday party. The house was quite large, and we decided to play hide-and-go-seek. The person who was 'it', lets call him Todd, stayed in the hosts bedroom and waited for a couple of minutes while the rest of us chose our hiding spots.

15 minutes pass... no one has been found

10 more minutes pass... has Todd even left the bedroom?

Myself and the host of the party got out of our hiding spaces to check on Todd, to see if he was asleep or something. We knock on the door to the bedroom, ""Come on in!"" - shouts Todd from the other side of the door.

The host and I proceed to open the door, to find Todd naked on the hosts bed, masturbating furiously, and laughing at us as we walked in and saw him.


A few weeks later and me and few friends are in an AIM [throwback!!] chatroom with Todd and a girl he has a crush on. We tell her the whole story. She laughs [via text], makes fun of Todd, and leaves. Todd has never spoken to me or anyone else in that chatroom since that day.

"Out of curiosity, have you ever had an incident or is this just a feeling you have?

I see this come up on Reddit a lot and, as a guy who spends a lot of time around kids, I feel like I am out of the loop on this one. I have never felt uncomfortable and didn't realize I was ""supposed"" to. I live in an area with a lot of kids and spend a lot of time at the park. It's not at all uncommon for me to start a game of kickball or touch football with my kids and have others join in. I actually just finished up a game of kickball (I was the designated pitcher for both sides) with the neighborhood kids. I have picked kids up at the park before to help them on a swing. I never received any thing other than compliments and smiles. 

I also coach youth sports and can't count the number of times kids have jumped into my arms after scoring. One of the kids, who was on the spectrum and was sensory seeking, would run up to me every practice and would hold onto my hand or wrap his arms around me. I live in an area with a ridiculous amount of helicopter parents and have still never had any issues. None of my male friends or relatives have experienced this either. Just trying to figure out where people live that have this fear. "

Both of the folks in that car were ok, so I went back up to the road where the driver and passenger of the second car were crawling out of the windows. They both looked to be about 16. When I got closer, I saw 2 girls lying in the road, one clearly DOA and the other gasping for air with a collapsed lung and multiple compound fractures. She was bleeding badly, and was by this point surrounded by people trying to keep her awake until EMTs arrived to intubate her. 

All of that was really shocking, but the scariest part was the behavior of the young driver. I talked to him for a long time to try and keep him calm. The first 5 minutes we talked, he spoke like we had just met under normal circumstances. I asked his name, where he went to school, and he answered normally. Then, every once in a while, he began snapping to reality for a few seconds. His eyes would change, and he would begin to panic, then snap right back out of it and resume making small talk like nothing ever happened. I've seen people in shock before, but never like that."

"Made a throwaway for this.  I was a racist for a long time when I was younger due to fear.  I grew up in a mostly hispanic neighborhood but went to a majority black school.  I had my teeth curb stomped out in third grade, was regularly jumped by by 'gangs' (as much as 3rd graders can be counted gangs).  We didn't have a lot of money so after the second time I got my winter coat knifed up i began hiding in the yards of a few houses off school property during recesses.  It didn't always work.  

One thing I do remember was being on the ground curled in a ball getting kicked when one of the kids said, ""That's for you whites loosing my dad his job.""  I remember laying there picking woodchips out of my face thinking, ""I just wish I had a dad...""

Eventually my mom re-married and I had to get adjusted to living in the suburbs and getting side looks because I didn't know how to 'act white'.  I had a hard time making friends and eventually I clammed up and spent most of highschool depressed, friendless and playing with computers.

Once I got out of highschool I started taking a martial arts class which really turned my life around.  I didn't realize how much I needed that physical confidence, but it's what brought me back from some unhealthy places.  I also started college in comp sci and shortly after started hanging out with a group that included a couple super introverted black nerds.  To put it bluntly I was terrified of them.  It still seems ridiculous that I was terrified of a short fat gay black guy with an unhealthy obsession for anime. I spent about a year talking with them over irc before I could get past that reflexive panic attack and actually talk to them normally (as normal as socially awkward nerds do at least).

To be honest I still feel the anxiety for some black people.  I'm fine with nerds (yes I can spot a fellow nerd a mile away), and people that are working/in uniform, but outside that... if i'm being honest I still get the panic.

God has gotten me this far.  Some day I'll get the rest of the way.  Slowly though."

I wasn't an expert, but this old Native American lady (no, seriously) had shown me and a few other people how to throw axes when I was in Boy Scouts. I gave it a try, and the basic level of skill I had, combined with extreme luck, meant that a teenager had stuck all the axes into the target in front of a bunch of people. I had very little clue what I was doing, but I played it off like I did."

"I worked as a live-in nanny for a young couple and their two kids. The father was 28 and owned his own record label for Mexican artists and easily made $3-$4mil per year. The mother was 26 and was famous on Instagram for flaunting their lavish lifestyle. They lived in a huge house in the middle of the desert probably 30 min outside of the city they designed themselves and it was honestly ridiculous. Each bedroom was so big it echoed and had it's own private walk in closet and ensuite bathroom as well as access to a wrap-around balcony that overlooked the courtyard, it was shaped like an hacienda. It had glass elevators, an indoor koi pond in the entryway, and in the courtyard they literally had a stage for the live music to perform when they had parties and a covered sitting area big enough to accomodate 30 tables. Their kitchen had a walk-in refridgerator and enough ovens/stoves to run a restaurant. On the roof they had a helipad and the guy owned like 4 helicopters. He had a Maserati, 2 Ferraris (one for his wife and one for him), and a rose-gold Range Rover.

They had parties every weekend. And not just cute cozy dinner parties - I'm talking 200-300 person, get-so-shitfaced-you-can-barely-stand parties. Live ""banda"" (Mexican music genre) so loud you can't hear yourself think, men in little groups taking strange pills, women all screaming and laughing gossiping at the table as they bounced babies on their knees, etc. There was one party where the father decided to challenge 3 of his guests to a race behind his house in the desert with his Ferrari and it flipped, but he was fine and was just pissed his car was damaged. There was another where people started jumping from the 2nd story balcony to the pool/fountain in the middle of the courtyard and a guy broke his foot. I always had to attend these parties to watch the kids, get them juice when they said they were thirsty, supervise when they played with other kids, tuck them into bed when it got late and the adults were getting too wild for the kids to see. Every single weekend, the mother and father would fight and get into screaming matches, usually the mother was mad he was making stupid decisions while under the influence (usually correct) and he would insist he was fine and she needed to stop trying to control him. She would go to bed mad, he'd stay up until 6 AM and finally crash then, and the next day they'd be fine like nothing happened.

The mother was a very beautiful, mostly sweet though kind of air-headed girl who had gotten with the father in high school and loved to talk about how she went through highs and lows with him, even when they lived with his parents. She had an affinity for drama and if there was a problem, she was all up in it. She pretended to hate the constant parties but also seemed to love the drama that came with them. She was absurdly glamorous and a had a private makeup artist who did her makeup everyday for Instagram and she took him with her on vacations and everything. She had a ridiculous amount of clothes and shoes and would spend easily over $5k maybe every two weeks on shopping. She was SUPER attached to her mom and her mom visited everyday as well as her 6 sisters - in fact the both of them were attached to their families, the father also had his brother, sister, mother and all of his cousins he grew up with at the house daily, they practically lived there. Overall a very ditzy but well-meaning person. The father? Not so much. Apparently he was an asshole before the money, but after it only got worse. Loves partying, loves showing off materialistic things, doing dangerous things (i.e. drag racing), and had no real regard for the well-being of his wife or kids because he assumed they'd be fine with his antics as long as he flung money at them.

The guy wasted an excess amount of money fully staffing his house so he wouldn't have to do anything himself. He claimed it was because he was very busy with work running his label - he'd relax for 2 weeks straight, fly out to Mexico for 2 days, then repeat. Not a very demanding schedule. His staff included 2 cooks, 3 housekeepers, an assistant for the mother and an assistant for him, a nanny (that was me), a planner (the lady that makes their parties happen and plans their vacations and other stuff), and 4 security guards to watch his house. Seriously, he was super paranoid somebody was going to attack his house. Had a full on security system with intricate locks to every door leading to the outside and security cameras and beefy, burly armed guards walking back and forth around his property.

I worked for them for around 2 1/2 years. It was an easy enough job taking care of the kids as they were both under the age of 6 and were actually pretty well-behaved despite the environment they were growing up in (easy for a child to get spoiled and bratty), just a little girl and boy. Watching all the antics unfold was pretty entertaining, it was like having a front row seat to a real life soap opera. But in the end, it turned out the security guards were for good reason, because the house ended up getting raided by the police twice on suspiscion he was a drug dealer but never found any evidence, and some men tried breaking into the house and sent death threats. I really don't think he himself was a drug dealer, he made so much money from his legal business that he didn't need to and he was probably too much of a wuss to do that anyway, but he definitely causally hung out with them and I'm positive they were guests at his parties, and mixing with that just brings problems. I quit after the death threats fiasco because I feared for my own safety. I feel bad for the kids."

I'm no wild success story... and my parents were probably better off not knowing how much time was spent gaming and bumming around instead of doing what I was there for.. but I ended up alright.

"Vet tech here.

There are so many different types of owners. I will not imply that I always know what is at the heart of the owner; maybe you can get more insight, especially with regular clients, but there's so much I don't know about most of them, so who am I to judge them, really?


The most difficult ones to deal with sometimes are the owners that reflect their own personal needs on the pet. They obviously love their pet, but because they find it hard to say goodbye or make difficult choices for them, the pets often have to suffer for it. Same goes for pet owners who reflect human qualities and behaviors on their pets. This often leads to misinterpretation. This is sometimes harmless, but not always. 

Some owners see their animal as a product, or a thing. Or something for a specific purpose, and they don't have a personal bond with it. Some people decide wether the animal is worth treating over how much the animal is worth moneywise, should it have to be 'replaced'. 

It's OK not to have a personal bond with your animals if you don't want to, as long as all their needs are met and quality health care is given. I'd honestly rather see that than some stubborn people who insist on doing things that harm their animals because they believe it is right or harmless. 


Edit: On a sidenote, I think anyone who bothers to take their animal to the vet does care about it to some degree. They might care about it for vastly different reasons, but if they didn't, they'd do much worse things. Having a volunteer job at an animal rescue and shelter has shown me that much, unfortunately.

But I WAS freaked out when I heard the raccoons SCATTER like maniacs like 15 minutes later. Then I heard a much larger animal approaching, but I barely heard any footsteps - just rustling of leaves.

"My drama teacher in high school told us about how the lead in the school play was a no-show on opening night, which was unusual as he was a very dedicated actor who never missed anything. They didn't have an understudy so she was preparing to go on for him when an ambulance pulled up to the front of the school and he hopped out of the back with his arm in a sling. He'd dumped his bike on the way to the school and had broken his wrist. He'd allowed the EMTs to patch him up but refused to go to the hospital because he needed to do the show, so they dropped him off. He also refused painkillers since he was worried about messing up his lines. He did the show and then went to the hospital to get a cast put on.

I was a PA, so basically a glorified gopher, and part of my job was to bring people coffee and one time *he* brought *me* a coffee, pretending I was some real important dude. I threw it on the ground and yelled ""I SAID TWO CREAMS, ONE SUGAR!"" and we had a good laugh about it.

When I started going to other people's houses more, I was astonished to find that boys and girls could be friends without it being a cardinal sin (unintentional relevancy in that turn of phrase).

"Going to the Riverwalk, taking a trolley to the Alamo, asking why Taco Cabana didn't meet their expectation of our famous Mexican food (don't worry, I love you TC)

Edit: Goddamn guys all 15 pretentious san antonians must be redditers because the pinky itt is fully extended. I never said the cabana was my favorite Mexican food. 

To the tourists: If you're visiting SA town for the first time, welcome! You must be hungry...¿donde comer? Well you must have noticed the brightly colored, pink and green ovals labeled 'Taco Cabana' all over town. Don't stop here. (Unless you're a down b like me and wants to get up in some fresh tortillas and queso at two in da morning💥)

For a sit down full on tourist experience head over to market square and get a table at Mi Tierra (what everyone does). Alternate restaurant in market square is La Margarita next door which I think is a better restaurant, with a nice patio and the wait is never close to Mi Tierra. 

Other Mexican in town I recommend: Jacala💥, Teka Molina, La Fonda, La Fogata 

Non Mexican: Smoke, Burger Boy, Two Bros BBQ, Rudys, chesters, Babes

Fast Mex: Mama Margies, Las Palapas, any taqueria that looks busy (or not really)

Breakfast/Lunch: Jims, Bill Miller, Original Donut Shop💥, Tip Top Cafe, Magnolia Pancake House, Blanco Diner💥

Go to the Alamo if you love Texas history and have studied the mission. It holds a special place in Texans hearts because we all study Texas history in school and spend quite a bit of time on this particular battle. Most of the country doesn't get this special connection to it. 

I'd suggest renting a bike and trying to complete the mission trail, checking out some of our incredible parks💥 (Eisenhower, Friedrich Wilderness are beautiful), or check out our Botanical or Japanese Tea Gardens--so relaxing. The Witty Museum off Broadway just went under a pretty awesome renovation and The Doseum (our newest children museum) is my 4 year olds favorite place in the city. So many things for kids to do there, also fun to feel immersed in everything with them.

"When I was 10 or so years old I was helping out my uncle at a livestock sale yard.  It was the pig sale day, all day farmers show up with trailer loads of pigs, big ones, small ones, and everything in between.  Well at the end of the day there was around 20 pigs that were either sick, deformed, hurt or for whatever reason could not be sold sitting in this one pen.  My uncle handed me a solid wood pickax handle and told me to ""hit em between the eyes"".  I went in that pen and one by one beat 20 pigs to death with this club.  Looking back I don't have any idea how I did it, but I didn't want to let my uncle down and I knew that is how things are done at places like that so I just did it.  It's without a doubt the most awful thing I've ever done in my life."

I had punctured my esophagus and air was pouring into my open chest cavity. Shit went into serious mode right then and there.

"Jacking off in economics class.

The desks were these huge drafting tables with covered sides and a shelf on the bottom. Sliding my shorts down enough to get my dick out took minimal effort to accomplish. 

My then girlfriend at the time sat a few rows up and a couple of desks over. Next to her though, was Jamie. She was a super hot senior who had to repeat junior year econ to graduate. I had been to enough parties to witness Jamie without her shirt on, her kissing other girls, and I was on the same bus she was when she gave blow jobs to half of the varsity football team. 

I had the perfect view of Jamie to smack it to.

Just as the climax began I faintly hear ""Go a head and talk among yourselves for the rest of class."" 

My girlfriend gets up and walks over to my desk. Unfortunately for me she's wearing her hair up in a sloppy bun. She had shoulder length auburn hair and the sloppy bun was really good looking on her. Also, I could see her neck. I fuckin loved her neck. It's a weird thing to be attracted to but it all started with hers. Anyway, She gets to my desk, picks up on what I'm doing and she gasps. 

Too late. I blow my load all over the inside of the desk. 

She leans in and whispers to me, horrifyingly, ""Are you masturbating!?"" and I could reply with was, ""Was. I was masturbating."""

But fast forward, they're doing it again and it's become dull to summer. Tom thinks it's her fault when it's just who she is, and he doesn't really realize that until the last scene when she reminds him that he wasn't ""the one"". Even the graduate scene, Tom likes the ending because ben and Elaine are together- but summer cries because she knows that the awkward shot of the two on the bus is them both realizing that theirs repercussions for their actions. Tom doesn't get it, but that's because he sees one thing- ben and Elaine's love, translates through him and summer. Summers reaction to the movie is exactly what she's experiencing because her and Tom are having a great time, but she knows the inevitable truth of their relationships ceiling.

"My wife's parents had a really bitter divorce.  Her dad was starting to suffer from dementia and her mom is disabled.  They were well off, however her dad made a series of life decisions that easily cost them over half their wealth (had a house built right before the recession, tried selling their old one after the recession hit, then moved out of their new house within 3 years and took another massive hit on that).  He was also let go from the job he had and was unable to keep any new jobs as he was suffering from mental issues.

It was basically each other's goal to leave the other side with nothing and so what little resources they had ended up sunk in legal costs.  While her dad definitely did things out of spite, considering less than 5 years later he's in a home with dementia and doesn't remember anyone, I'm a little more sympathetic to him since who can really say how much the mental issues were affecting him during the divorce.  Her mom though was straight up spiteful for the sake of spite.  When her dad tried collecting disability because of OCD she fought him the whole way.  When he filled out the financial disclosures she dumped thousands of dollars trying to allege he had offshore bank accounts.

The real victim here is my wife.  The process definitely exacerbated and accelerated her dad's mental decline.  Her mom came out the winner I guess you'd say, but after all the bills were paid, she has less than probably 25% of what they started out with when they initiated the divorce proceedings.  She now lives with us in an in-law suit, living off disability and unable to touch any of the money she won in the divorce because it counts as income against the government assistance she gets for having MS.  Both her parents lost the last somewhat functional years of their lives consumed by just fighting each other in the divorce. "

"I was raised mormon, which is intrinsically racist. The book of Mormon actually teaches that dark skin is a curse and Mormon prophets taught that blacks were black because they were lukewarm in following God in the spirit world before they were born (yeah, I know, weird). I didn't realize I was racist, I just believed what Mormon leaders taught. 

I reevaluated my views as a teenager. I repeated something a prophet named Spencer Kimball said about how different races shouldn't intermarry. My mom sat me down and let me know that it was wrong to say that and that two loving people of any race can marry each other. Due to what I had said, my mom was about as upset as I had ever seen her. This taught me that what the Mormon church had taught me about other races was wrong. 

Later I learned that pretty much everything the Mormon church taught me about anything was wrong."

"That's not how it works in the US. What the OP was referring to is a PPA, where you buy your power from the solar company. Say, you pay 20 cents per KWH from your local energy company. The solar company comes along and says you'll pay 15 cents that will grow at 3% per year, and you're contracted for 20 years. They use your roof to install their panels. Technically, you're not getting any benefit from the panels on your house because you're paying for all electricity anyway. On top of that, there are huge tax breaks in the  US for buying panels, but since you're not buying the panels, you get none of the tax benefit, and the solar company gets all of it. In my state, the tax break is almost 50% the cost of the panels.  "

"&gt; Responsible breeders aren't the problem.

Responsible breeders are vastly outnumbered by mills and backyard breeders. People want a purebred dog, until they learn what a purebred dog costs from a real breeder, so then they find some shitbag on Facebook selling ""pure bread dacshund puppies"" [sic] in the CVS parking lot for $100 each. Turns out that puppy is inbred as fuck, so after a while it starts attacking anything that moves and shitting all over the place all the time, so they drop it off at the local shelter or abandon it on the side of the road for someone else to deal with, and the cycle continues. 

Honestly, you really have no business buying from even a reputable breeder unless you specifically need a working/hunting breed of dog, or you intend to have the dog compete in shows. Otherwise, you're just interested in the vanity of telling people that you own a ""pure bred ______"", likely can't or won't provide for whatever special care most pure bred dogs require, and should have adopted a regular ol' happy mutt from the local humane society who doesn't need special grooming, special training, or constant stimulation to keep it occupied and prevent destructive boredom.

The next day, he was a no call/no show. He just flat out quit. When I got home, I asked him why he didn't come in. He said working there was too hard.

"i did door to door sales selling coupons for local businesses. $20 for the 2 pages of coupons, $10 of each sale went to me. i got 40 to sell each day, and i would sell between 25-35 each day. ive sold all 40 at least a dozen times in the 2 years i worked there. when you sold all your coupons, you walked back into the office and drop your book, then everyone would cheer for you and the boss would give you an extra $50.


i worked whenever i wanted to. each day started at 8am, we'd leave the office at 9am after a team meeting. we would leave in groups of 4-6 people and would return to the office anywhere between 7-10pm, depending on your location that day. you were assigned 4-10 blocks depending on the density of the houses. you did as many laps of those blocks until you managed to speak with someone at at least 90% of the houses, or until you decided to quit. but you wouldnt leave the area until everyone was done in your group, so it helped to agree on a time and place to meet up before leaving for the day.


the job was ok, a lot of walking, but the money was ridiculous. the coupons were mostly 'buy one get one free deals' which almost anyone can take advantage of. we targeted poorer neighborhoods because they were likely to need the savings more. nicer areas often consisted of people too proud to use coupons. i was in my teens and i only did it for the money. $250-$350, under the table, a day was a lot of money for a teenager in the early 2000's. 


still not sure how shady it was because even i bought the coupons for the savings. would recommend to anyone who needs a job. also, every job ive had since doesnt pay as well, but im also not outside in the south walking 10+(?) miles a day.


my boss would stay at the office and collect the other $10 from everyones sales. i wanted to be in his shoes. i quit due to the heat, all the walking, and the long hours. this was in new orleans and we went as far as alabama, depending on the location of the coupons businesses.

"I work for a group that provides gifts to life-threateningly/terminally ill children. I could tell you a hundred stories about these amazing kids, because that vast majority of them have somehow managed to make something of the shitty hand life has dealt them.

However, perhaps the bravest story I have is of a little girl who donated her bone marrow to her older brother with a very rare bone cancer. Her parents didnt pressure her, she wasn't asked. She insisted on being tested and made the decision on her own.

She's 7. How many adults would be willing to do what she did? 

I was amazed to meet her and her brother. Both were incredibly well-spoken, likely from spending most of their lives at the hospital. The brother (who is about 10 now) gave a speech to a room of adults better than most people twice his age could give.

Both of them are incredible children, and the world is lucky to have them. "
"The main reason this movie caused a crisis for me is that the day I saw it in theaters with my best friend, I was 6 and I walked home from school to find my house completely empty and locked up. My family had literally moved away while I was at school. My older sister had stayed home sick and they had a move planned and either didn't bother to tell me because I was just a 6 year old or they told me and I forgot because I was just a 6 year old. My dad was supposed to have been there when I got home to take me to the new house but he's really bad at remembering he has children and forgot all about me. I just kind of sat there and cried for awhile and then decided I should walk back to school because maybe a teacher would be there or something. My best friend's mom had picked her up from school and saw me walking away from my [former] home and back to school crying so she stopped and picked me up. When we got back to their house, she managed to get ahold of my mom and let her know where I was and that I was fine and going to see the Goofy Movie later and they could come pick me up afterwards. She saved me from a lot more trauma than I should have felt on the day I went to school and came home to an empty house and my entire family gone.

Edited to clear up: my parents both had their flaws but they mostly meant well throughout my childhood. I'm assuming my mom was busy with my sick sister that day and my dad got caught up with something and lost track of time or forgot he was supposed to pick me up. He did that a lot because he was just like that. Not a fantastic dad but this isn't the example I'd use to show he's kind of a wad as a parent and a human. He did plenty of other shitty stuff that would show that later on. My mom was a pretty great mom and I honestly never thought about why she didn't remember me, either, so I guess I always figured she was with my sister and *assumed* her husband could remember the first grader without excess hand holding."

"1. Football shirt, usually the England national team but occasionally a local club.  (do they issue those at Gatwick airport or something? ""Oh you're going to Florida?  You must wear this attire everywhere you go!"").  Thick football shirts are not good for staying cool, find a t-shirt that's light coloured.
2. Lobster red.
3. Complaining about the heat. (Florida in the Summer is in the high 90s F/40s C with 100% humidity.  That's insanely hot for someone from NW Europe).
4. Complaining about the crowds. (Duh)
5. Wife and kids in tow, wife sunburned and yelling at the kids to stop whining.  Kids in Disney shirts also sun burned, whining about that and some toy they can't afford.

To my fellow Englishmen from someone who has lived in Florida for 17 years there is a simple solution to all of this.  **Visit in the Winter months**, avoiding Christmas time (US that means the last week of November until the first week of January) and mid March (Spring break).

But, I think the message to be open to life's opportunities is perhaps more important than any of those in people's everyday lives and I think it's awesome that there is a film that encapsulates that...

The only animal my uncle actually warned me about was a large and visually unremarkable ant. I had a wheelbarrow full of them at the time, since I was moving around dirt in his garden, so I was not too thrilled. When I asked if they would kill me, he said, ""Nah, but you'll wish you were dead."""

Imagine being born in 1900. You probably still get around by horse and buggy most of the time, if not on foot. You might have electricity in your house, or maybe a telephone - which is of course connected to a land line. We only just became aware of the 3 major blood types, barely know that an atom is a 'thing', and don't understand its structure, and we didn't even have a standardized time zone system in the United States.

Now, you're 69 years old. You saw a world go to war twice, end the second with a bomb based on a nuclear chain reaction. You drove a thousand miles away for a vacation not long ago, in a car with air conditioning, going 75mph. On the 20th of July, you're going to see a man land on the moon, broadcast live to a screen that doesn't use film nor wires to get the images.

We tend to think we've come a long way from 1969 to now, but the way we live our lives isn't really so starkly different than it was for our friend born 117 years ago, who probably died before the majority of you reading this were born."

"This will only end badly, I assure you. I've been in this situation multiple times in the past. Not being allowed any alone time is a massive red flag.

My last relationship ended on Mother's Day when my ex wasn't feeling well and refused to go with me to see my mom. She told me our relationship was over if I went to see my mom by myself, so I walked right out the door as she began having a meltdown.

I should have seen the warning signs. Throughout the relationship, any time I wasn't giving her 100% of my attention, an argument would ensue. Even when it was something important that I needed to get done, it was always held against me.

I can't tell you how many times I heard things like:

""Oh, your job is more important than our relationship?""

""If you ___ instead of hanging out with me, we have a major problem.""

""Why do you enjoy having hobbies that don't involve me?""

My advice is to just end it now. This is not healthy or normal. Make a nice, clean break and don't look back."

"&gt;Homeless shelters obviously are your best bet 

No homeless person I know would say this.  Shelters are generally shitholes.

The cold weather shelter in my area is so bad it's not worth the trouble.  Beds are so close you can reach out and touch the person next to you, who is usually filthy, stinking and mentally ill.  Theft and bugs are rampant.  And the place is run by mostly ex convicts who look for any excuse to exercise their power.  At best these places are simply mis-managed.  At worst they are an outright scam.

The key is to build up trust and always do good ass work. Become dependable and trustworthy to the higher ups. Become an asset to the company.

Once you've gotten a couple years of that, go to your boss and float the idea of being allowed to work from home one day a week (pick like a Tuesday or Wednesday. No ""3 day weekend"" day). If they allow it, show that you can still get shit done. Eventually it'll expand.

On his first day on the job, I had several of our female employees come and complain to me that he had been showing them pictures of his junk that he had taken with his phone.  I started a quick investigation and found he had shown these pics to 6 different employees.  He was fired on his first day. I didn't want him around the staff and definitely not around the residents (we specialized in Alzheimer's care, so about 80 percent of residents had some form of it).  

His mom came up to the office and yelled at me and demanded to see the investigation notes on why exactly he was fired. I just kept telling her that I could tell her nothing of what happened that day since her son was over the age of 18 and this was something to take up with him.

I'm not a divorce lawyer but I overheard a conversation with one.  While I was waiting in the lobby for my child support case to be called (ex wasn't paying) a woman walked in and sat down.  Five minutes later her lawyer comes in and asks why she isn't dressed better.  She was wearing what looked like a night gown and bright white flip flops.  She explained to him that her husband took everything except that outfit and all of her left shoes.  She didn't have money to buy anything else so the neighbor loaned her flip flops because they were the only thing that fit.  At first I felt bad for her but then she was whining that she wanted more alimony because the money he was paying weekly barely covered her car payment for her brand new Mercedes.

"Again, not a full kidnapping, but I almost did something stupid enough when I was just 21.

I had pulled into a gas station late at night. I had gotten gas when a guy came up to me (this wasn't a particularly bad area). He said he was stranded, and asked if I could just give him a short ride down the road to his place as it was cold. 

Stupidly, I agreed, but said I had to pay for my gas and stuff first. I wasn't worried. I was an invincible young adult! (Plus I was legally carrying a firearm).

I went in, bought my stuff, came back out, and around my car were the guy and two others. I stopped a few feet away. 

""We're ready,"" the first guy said. The other two guys weren't making eye contact. 

I muttered something about it was just supposed to be him. He said it was okay.

While I was reasonably sure I could handle myself against one person, I knew I had just gotten myself screwed. I turned around, went back in the store, and (not having a cell on me) asked the clerk if he knew the guys, and if they were a problem, to call the police. 

The clerk did, I stayed in the store. The guys hung around my car for a few minutes, but a cop car pulled up shortly after. I stayed in the store so I didn't hear what was said, but the cop pulled up next to my car and he and the guys talked for a little bit, and then they walked off. 

I walked back out, cop asked if I was okay, I said yeah, and got in my car and drove off (never went back to that station).

PROBABLY wouldn't have been a kidnapping, but was pretty sure it was about to be a robbery or carjacking. But they were waiting for me to get in the car."

After about 3 of them I eventually developed the ability to sense them immediately so they couldn't trick me anymore, but I'm also kinda scarred for life cause 10 years on I still have flashbacks and don't trust people that try and show me videos. I'm also generally paranoid of any long silences in videos and take my headphones off when I hear them, just in case.

Come to think of it my parents really enjoyed scaring me as a kid. Maybe that's why I'm terrified and paranoid of any horror games/films/TV whatsoever.

""Hey I'm Jeff and I'm in the military""

Penn: ""Oh wow, that's amazing Jeff, thank you so much for your service, can we get a round of applause please for this man putting his life on the line for us back home? Come on give him a round of applause!""

And the audience went nuts, 15 seconds of straight clapping, right in the middle of a magic trick. All because the guy was in the military, not a civilian job like a cook.

I'm all for thanking war veterans and such, but Americans go way over the top for them every single time the words 'military', 'army', 'navy', or 'air force' are mentioned."

But, the truth about Brian is that Brian was a shitton of fun.  Brian rolled with punches big time.  You could take off on a cross state road trip with Brian with nothing but a water bottle and an extra pair of underwear and know you were going to have a great time.  I once got stranded with him on the side of the road somewhere in the middle of BFE Idaho and there was no freak out, it was just a good time and we figured it out.  There is just never a stressful moment with that guy.  He's got a sense of humor to shake the skies with laughter, he's got excellent judgement, a winning personality and just - in general an ace.  He's great to be around no matter the circumstance, I guess is what I'm saying.  Sure, he's got shitty tattoos, is a little overweight, and slightly balding but the dude is fun as fuck.

He also happens to book shows for dope bands, which means you get in free just about everywhere to see cool bands.  He also owns a record store that hosts independent shows.  He's got two kids and both his kids are super duper badasses, like the kids you wish you had.  Kids that rock out to Ozzy and hang out at record stores.

The guy is just a riot.  And besides being a good time he was smart, intellectual, loyal, unwaiveringly supportive, a real rock.  A diamond even.  Just an amazing person.

It's one of the greatest shames of my life I didn't lock him down when I had the chance because all my friends thought I was too pretty to be with him.  He is a winner and anyone who gets him is lucky to have him whether he's a stunner or not.  The guy is a keeper and I was a fool."

"One year, my extended family was all really busy with various things, and I wasn't married yet so I didn't have another family to invite mine along with.

Me, my mom, dad, sister, and grandma ended up going to a restaurant. Before we ordered, we saw a man sitting alone. He had ordered turkey, and was sipping on a glass of wine. He was in business gear, so in reality he was probably on a business trip and wasn't some black sheep of his family, but it tore us up. He declined the invite to our table, but I hope he still enjoyed his Thanksgiving."

Their kitchen was the nicest kitchen I'd ever seen. Actually their whole house. She made bacon, eggs, toast, jam, juice, coffee, etc. I was like oh hell yes! My friend says ""Why did you make me this crap? I don't want anything other than chocolate milk, sheez."" I was floored that his dad didn't even glance up from the newspaper he was reading, and his mom said ""Oh, sorry. I'll get that for you."""

"I got into the Disney College Program, which is a program where you work at Disney World or Disneyland from a semester to a year.

I mainly wanted to do it because I needed a break from school. I was stressing out so much that I would sink into vortexes of never ending depression. I spent so much time in the library trying to get work done that the librarians were concerned for me. My roommates only liked me for my car and never cleaned our dorm. I'd drive an hour to and from home each week just so I could get away from college for the weekend. I wanted a break and thought this paid internship would give me the break I needed plus I thought it would look good as a job on my resume.

Well, when I got into the program I told a friend that I was going. He said ""I wouldn't go if I were you. You're an English major. What does this have to do with Disney Parks? I know school stresses you out but that's because you have a bad work ethic. If you can't handle schoolwork you won't be able to handle Disney World. No one in the English career is going to look at your resume and think Disney World is a relevant job, instead they're going to judge you for not finishing college on time."" He basically argued with me for weeks...he was trying to help me but it just made me feel worse about life...

I went to Disney. I almost broke a selling record, lol. I also graduated school on time through summer and online classes. I still don't know what I want to do with my English degree but I don't regret doing the program.

"I did a game jam (game development competition w/ a team of strangers) and the manager that got picked for my team was the owner of some gaming startup, and had launched some crappy steam platformer so we were supposed to be super excited to work with someone 'in the industry'.

My whole team was full of game dev students, but I've already finished school and have a job and just do these competitions for fun, so I was the only one not trying to impress him.

He promised us a bunch of things including getting music assets and graphic design from his startup employees. I had previously offered music assets that I had from a friend, but he turned them down. (the game launched with no music or sound.)

He had us make trello accounts and then proceeded to step back, sit in the lunch/break area and contribute nothing to the game. I'm pretty sure he was just there to make an appearance and promote his startup. People were impressed with him however, and he spent most of that time being a mini-celebrity because he launched a steam game.

He showed up like the last hour of the last day and we had essentially made a completely different game than what he had originally discussed with us. With him being nowhere to be found, we decided to make numerous changes without him there. He was furious and insisted everything be changed immediately. I saved my code and walked.

Our team ended up winning the competition and suddenly this guy started acting like it was his great management skills that won it for us. He tweeted '____ Games Manager and a team of strangers won ____ game jam!'. The tweet was used for a local news article. I called him out publicly very loudly, and one of the other guys I was working with on the team also did. He kept the tweets up and was 'gracious' to include our names tagged in another picture.

Also they shipped our prizes to him and it took two months for him to get the prize to me. He kept trying to get me to meet with him, and at one point offered me a job at his startup. I turned him down every time and insisted he shipped my prize."

"I'll never forget the day I discovered I can't make a normal check mark on a list like everyone else.

Seems incredibly minor, but I discovered it only after somebody mentioned something on reddit about the satisfaction of checking off things on a list and the association of pleasure related to the long swoop of the pen.

I had no idea what they were talking about.

And not because I don't make lists. I started paying attention to how I make my check marks and the long swoop never seemed to be that satisfying to me.

Then one day, I happened to notice as a friend sat across from me at a table, checking off something from a list--wait, what did I just see? Something didn't look quite right, but because she was doing it ""upside down"", I didn't catch the nuance.

I said ""Do that again.""

""Do what?"" she asked, confused.

""Your check mark.""

She did it again, and I sat there dumbfounded as I realized that the universe had just turned inside out for me--she had started with the short leg of the check, and then with a casual flair, flicked her pen to make the long stroke of the check mark.

""Wait, that's not how it works. That's not how any of this works!"" my brain screamed at me, deafening my inner monologue. She clearly had no appreciation for what I had just been shown, as if Homo erectus had strolled in and dropped on me--Cro-magnon man--the virtues of fire. All my life, a secure majority member of righties, I was confident in the thought that there is only one way to make a check mark. This day, that security was shattered.

I asked for her pen and took a quick, furtive shot at making a check mark ""her"" way--disaster! The short leg was barely more than an elongated period, the back slash's ugly infant cousin. The *long* leg was all that--nearly 3 kilometers long.

I tried again. This time the short leg was much better, almost the desired length--and the long leg was identical in length, leaving me with a left leaning ""v"".

Undaunted, I continued valiantly, my friend looking on with equal parts bemusement and growing concern for my faculties.

""What are you do....?"" She drifted off and squelched a giggle as it dawned on her--I had no idea how to make a ""normal"" check mark. And the more I tried being non-chalant about it, the worse the results.

Suppressing her glee, she asked me ""How do you normally make a check mark?"" I replied with my typical method, long leg ending precisely where I intended, short leg at exactly the desired angle and length. Perfect!

She laughed out loud at my frustration. I had discovered today not only that I was a freak, an outcast who prides himself on good penmanship, but that I was also a dinosaur, unable to adapt and doomed to the tarpits of check markdom.

I can't make a check mark the right way."
"We have a family owned pharmacy in my town.  Sorry to say my experience has been the opposite.  I hate Walmart, but they are less expensive.

I had a table of 3 kids my age, maybe a few years younger (I'm 18). Right after they sat themselves in my section while I was taking care of a table of 22, they get frustrated. Later on, they get angry because their food took longer than ten minutes. The girls started to call me a bitch, whore etc. 

My big table saw what happened and tipped me 80 bucks, it made my whole day :) 

It also helped because my late rent was due that very day and I paid it! People like that are what keep me doing what I do. "

"She is such a fucking bad person. She puts her feelings in front of everyone else's.

Like in the S4 crossover with the Flash. Oliver is upset about something and doesn't want to talk about it. So Felicity gets mad he's keeping a secret and leaves him.

However, this happens while Oliver is about to go onto a mission to stop an immortal wizard from destroying a city. Like 5 minutes before he leaves she dumps him. So since he's distraught about her leaving him, he fucks up and get LITERALLY everyone killed.

So the the Flash has to **TRAVEL IN TIME** to stop Felicity from being a giant bitch so Oliver doesn't fuck up.

So yeah, Felicity put herself before everyone and got them all killed. They literally had to time travel to stop her from being a bitch."

He was not comfortable with the relationship and wedding of his ex-wife **to the person she cheated on him with**! What  a monster! Was he a bit whiny about it? Sure, but the way his friends handled it was pretty unsympathetic. This was the person that was banging his wife behind his back for fucks sake.

Let's not forget that they were going to give Ross's son a hyphenated last name of his mother and her lover, leaving Ross's name out entirely.

Susan and Carol were mean-spirited, spiteful, and cruel to a man that they completely betrayed, and were never called out nor punished for their behavior. In fact, it seemed as though the writers thought that they were writing strong, lesbian characters when they were actually writing cruel and thoughtless people who happened to be lesbians. 

This always to me seemed emblematic of Hollywood treated minorities that it hadn't quite learned how to write yet. They would over-correct for a few years and make the characters without any real flaws, as if they weren't real people or something, before eventually learning to just not make being gay the only important thing about them."

"Hired a kid, let's call him John, fresh out of school to help us.  He would download porn onto his phone and then go to the restroom to jackoff every hour or so.  Whenever I'd go to the restroom he was in the stall and I could hear the porn playing loudly from his earphones. Then he would work until 2 in the morning to finish his work and come into work looking like hell.  

He'd always get his work done, but he was a disaster.  I saw him typing at his desk, looking exhausted, and noticed that his hands were waterlogged and wrinkled looking.  

Another time, we were all in the conference room and someone say, ""Hey John, are you okay?""  I couldn't prove it, but I'm pretty sure that he was jacking himself off under the conference room table!

Thankfully he moved on to another firm after about a year.   Before leaving, he wiped his hard disk completely so that the computer wouldn't even boot.  Unfortunately, he couldn't have bothered to clean up the disgusting stains on the carpet, walls and under his desk.  

I bought one of those blacklight things that show bodily fluids.  Everywhere in the office was clean except under his desk, on his walls, and all over his computer....and my computer...and my secretary's computer, chair and filing cabinet.

4. They do not hire people every year.
5. Even if you get the job, seniority gets the best schedules and flights.
6. Except for mainland US (from my observations), they basically require having fluency in at least three languages and pick based on appearance as well, so basically only beautiful women and the rare super hot guy get the job. This is especially true in Asian countries.

"Accountant/Consultant

I tend to work more than 40 hours, sometimes I don't. I work from home 95% of the time. 

I'm not a CPA, I decided to not go within the public sector, and no... I'm not doing anyone's taxes.

I got here by working at several different accounting jobs over the last 7 years until I found a company that is based in New Jersey but pretty much works through Skype/Outlook and the phone with clients. I got lucky.

My daily routine: I get up in the morning, usually a bit of Reddit and breakfast, shower and after 8:30 AM or 9, I'm online and working on my laptop. If I have down time, I'm on Reddit (duh) or doing some house chores or watch some TV or play some games. I don't have a set lunch hour, obviously. Some days I'll finish at 7 PM, some days I'm done by 1 PM, it just depends on the work flow.

Very, very satisfied. For YEARS I've hated that I had to sit at a desk from 8 to 5 and HAD to take a lunch hour. It just seemed like a waste of my own efficiency when I could be doing better things with my time... and now I do.

EDIT: Saw someone else do this, so I'll join in:

PRO:

* I don't know what work clothes are. Shorts and a shirt? Pijamas most days.

* I shave once a week, because my wife demands it.

* I make my own hours, my boss doesn't care if I work 8 hours a day, or 4, or 12, as long as my work is done every day as it has been requested of me. I've worked 3 hour days on a Friday.

* My kitchen is clean, all the time. 

* None of this mumbo jumbo about co-workers heating up fish or talking too much or too loudly. No office gossip.

* I'm MUCH more efficient with my time management because if I get something done NOW, that frees me up later. At an office, I'd waffle because I knew I'd have to still be at the office at 3:30 and could just do stuff then.

CON:

* Cabin fever can be real. 

* Sometimes it's 4:55 PM and I was done working at 3, but I have to get back on if it's deemed urgent - if not, eh.

* Sometimes the allure of just sitting down and doing nothing is devastating.

* No such thing as a sick day. I still haven't decided if this is good or not.

* Since people can't see me, sometimes they won't get back to me. Meh."

Left hand pays the right hand $2M for $50M of records on paper, and your artist just had a record-setting debut.

In my last job we were looking at paying a big artist to produce a music video related to a product we built. A major record label offered to do this, they gave us an offer that was basically a menu like pay $X for Y records sold, and so forth."

"If you wake up with your arm asleep because you were laying on it, the fastest way to make it ""wake up"" is to stick your arm straight up in the air and let the blood drain back down. Then lay your arm flat and allow blood flow to resume normally.

For people that get stuffy noses- pick a nostril you want to have clear. I tend to prefer my right nostril but it works both ways. Pick the side you want clear and lay on your side so that nostril is on top. Prop your head up on your hand so your head is resting at around a 45 degree angle relative to the surface you are laying on. This should clear the nostril on top pretty quickly. If not, try tilting your head at different angles until it does. This doesn't always work, but for me it usually does."

"This'll probably get buried--Darkest moment of my life--In college, I was in a two year committed relationship with an innocent Christian girl, let's call her Haley. Haley was a youth leader at our local church and just as one would expect, she was saving herself for marriage. (I was completely okay with this) Unfortunately, we hit a rocky patch where I was going through depression and could not really find value in myself, let alone in any relationship, so we went through a messy breakup.   

I had the brilliant idea to rebound the very next day with Haley's best friend and co-leader Sara, who had long distance boyfriend.( **we'll circle back to this later)  Unfortunately, this wasn't just a simple case of cheating. The following night, Haley came over to ""end it for good"" via a personal letter, she was reading aloud.  After she finished this heart-wrenching monologue, one thing leads to another and we ended up having really emotional sex. As we were lying in bed breathless afterward, it dawns on her not only did she just break her purity promise, but also that the box of condoms we utilized already had a couple missing and Sara had casually mentioned being at my place the night before. Realization hit her like a high-speed truck and the haunting look of betrayal and overwhelming sadness she gave me still gives shudders. To realize that you’ve completely emotionally broke someone you once cared deeply about has to be the worst thing I’ve ever done.

To add a shitty cherry on top of that massive fuck up, Sara’s boyfriend moved to our college soon after and we became the best of friends. To this day he has no idea what happened between Sarah and I,  and last week I gave the “best man’s speech” at their wedding.

"At a bar with some friends one night. They went to get some shots while I watched the table. Pretty girl in a really nice club outfit and collar (which I find quite sexy) sitting across from me at another table doing the same thing. We make eye contact, she smiles. Happens a couple of times. She taps the chair next to her, inviting me to go over. I do. (I never get flirted with, so I'm super excited at this point)

Sit down, music is SUPER loud, can't hear a thing she's saying, but try to pass it off like I can and make small talk. Next thing I know, when I turn my head to talk to her, she's jamming her tongue in my mouth. Fuck. Yes.

When there's a lull in the music, she whispers to me ""Do you want to get out of here?"" Uhhh. Yup.

We leave notes for our friends on the tables (this is the mid 90s), and hop in a cab, she shows the driver her Student ID so he knows where to go. We're making out the whole time and just about get down to it in the cab when he pulls up to the dorm. 

Get inside, no words spoken. We get to her room and on her bed and just start going all out. I'm going down on her and she starts breathing super heavy. Like, she sounded like she was hyperventilating. It was bad. I took my head up to ask if she was ok, but she just pushed my head back down. Fair enough, then.

It just got worse, she started sounding like an idling chainsaw and it was freaking me out a bit. So then she pulls me up and whispers in my ear, asking me of I have a condom. Unfortunately I don't, neither does she. Dammit. So there was no hot doggin' to tuna town that night. So I just kept going to town until she got off, sounding like a boat motor, then we both just passed out.

Next morning we wake up, she's getting dressed and nudges me, I hear a whisper, ""You have to go, my roommates will be here here soon."" I open my eyes and I'm like WHAT THE FUCK. She's standing there, still looking pretty as fuck, but the sun was now shining in the window and that collar she had on? Not a collar. It was a trach.

"Although I do work a full 40 hour week, I work from home every day. I'm a software developer for a large company specializing in camping products. I mainly work on fixing minor bugs that come up, or create/update pages. 

During my second year of college, I decided that I wanted to get into programming. My brother was a developer, and he always had good things to say about the field. Until that point, I knew a lot about hardware, but nothing about software. He began teaching me the basics, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP. I started the next year of college at one of the public colleges in my state, but dropped out soon after. I worked odds-and-ends jobs until I landed my first position as an intern at a local software company, and went full time 3 months later.

About a year after going full-time, I began working from home, as I lived about 60 miles away from work. I still had to drive into work about once a week, for client meetings, until I accepted a job offer 4 months ago with my current position. I am a contractor until the end of August, at which point I hope to be hired on full time.

My work is in a different time zone than I am, so I work 9:30 AM to 6:30 PM. I usually wake up every morning around 9:20 AM, log on my company-provided laptop, connect to the VPN, remote into a VM, and begin working. I have a daily meeting at 11 AM, but it only  lasts 15 minutes. Other than that meeting, I don't have much contact with any co-workers or supervisors, and I honestly like it that way.

The job is 1000x less stressful that my previous one, and I absolutely love it. Everything is organized, not too hard, but still provides a challenge. The pay is a good amount for my experience, and amazing for my age (I'm 24). I am able to live comfortably supporting my wife and newborn, while my wife is able to be a stay-at-home mom, so I get to spend the whole day with my family. We are able to pay bills, put money into savings, and still have enough left over to go out on the weekends.

As with any job, there are some pros and cons:

**Pros:**

* Getting to work in my pajamas
* Not having people watch what I'm working on
* Limited contact with others/Get to work alone
* Have a good income
* Freedom to take breaks/lunch when I want
* Can watch TV while I work
* Get to spend time with family throughout the work day

**Cons:**

* Cabin Fever. Having a laptop makes this easier, as I frequently switch rooms throughout the day. In the morning, I may be in the living room or sitting room, but in the afternoon, I'll switch to my bedroom or my office.
* Delayed responses from co-workers. Sometimes, I need to work with others on tasks that I'm assigned to (a designer created a mockup and I need to build it). When I message a co-worker for something that I need, it could easily be a full day before I get a response.
* Project managers aren't developers. This is a bit of a pro and con together. By not knowing much about programming, they don't ask many questions about projects I'm working on, allowing me to keep everything short and sweet. On the other hand, they aren't able to help much if I run into an issue.

Personally, the pros definitely outweigh the cons for me. I've been working almost exclusively from home for over a year, and I really don't know if I could go back to a regular office job. I love what I do, and couldn't be happier, at least, until I *hopefully* get hired on full-time.

**EDIT:**
This comment blew up way more than I expected! Just wanted to go ahead and answer some of the common questions I've been asked.

**Q: Where should I start to learn programming?**

**A:** This is just from my experience, so don't take it to heart. I began by learning HTML, then CSS, then JavaScript, then another language of some kind. There are tons out there to choose from, and some appeal more to some than others (PHP, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc). 

**Q: What resources are there to learn programming?**

**A:** There are tons of resources out there. W3 Schools, CodeCademy, Lynda.com, Team Treehouse. I've also seen others mention FreeCodeCamp and Learn.ShayHowe.com.

**Q: How did you find a remote job?**

**A:** I searched for about 2 years before I found one. I was unsatisfied with my previous employer for multiple reasons, and I wanted to find something different. The only problem was that I lived a good 1.5 hours away from the closest developer positions. I reached out to a recruiter, who was on the lookout for 2 years before a remote position came up. I applied for the position, and a month later, I was working my first fully remote job.

**Q: How much experience do you have?**

**A:** I've been a developer for ~4 years.

**Q: What major should I choose in college to be a programmer?**

**A:** I'm not exactly the best person to ask, as I dropped out of college my junior year. I was enrolled in a Computer Science program. Since then, I've started back at a new university with a major in Computer Information Sciences, just to finally finish my degree. My advice is to do some research on a college you like to see what majors they offer, and what all is covered in their CS courses.

Just because we're men doesn't mean we can't be weak at times. The other day I had to cry. Normally I just cry alone. I was in my truck on my lunchbreak crying my eyes out and a female co-worker came and talked to me and just rubbed my back while I cried. I had forgotten how good it felt to just feel another human touch you gently when you're sad. I might be able to bench 350 and break your jaw with one punch, but I'm still human."

"I remember I was little I was rooting through my parents bedroom closet while they're we're gone, totally trying to find hidden birthday presents or anything. I can across a wooden box hidden in the back of the closet behind some clothes. I pulled the box out into the light and opened it up. I was shocked at what I found; it was full of different collars; mostly black and leather, some with metal spikes on them, different restraints and harness, a ton of rope, and several different whips. I closed the box and slid in back into the closet and walked out of the room. I was so confused because we didn't have a dog or anything so I didn't know why they had those collars, there was also this red ball thing attached to a strap with a buckle sorta like a belt. I'm not sure if this was like a muzzle or something to keep the dog from biting you or something but I'm not sure. "

My dumbass thought that she just fell and accidentaly fell with her ass and vagina straight in my face.

We couldn't have any sex that night anymore, it was hilarious

"The people who get annoyed at that are people who've never seen a good DJ live.

They can make a crowd go wild and the atmosphere is amazing. They promote other DJs by using their songs in the mix so you can discover new talent, and they sometimes play some unreleased tracks in their sets.

Also the people who look down on it because 'anyone can do it' should try it for themselves and see if they can get a crowd going and make a quality mix.

When I first saw a DJ live I didnt know what to expect and my friends just dragged me into it. Now I go to see them often as they are the most fun type of act to see live, its just constant dancing and fun. You dont get that often with over live acts.

Now, I am a stubborn SOB and telling them I was wrong wounded my pride. Took me weeks to man up. To deal with the shame. Not saying you should feel shame, sometimes things just don't work out.

Liberal? Cool, tons of liberals here. Conservative? Cool, tons of conservatives here too. 

Pittsburgh has a bunch of stuff to do and is one of the cheapest cities in the U.S., great for young families, college students or recent graduates. The job market is pretty decent and everyone is generally pretty nice. Unless you shit talk our sports teams, don't do that in Pittsburgh. 

Can't speak about Philly much because I live near Pittsburgh, but Philly has good food, is close to other cities like NYC and D.C. and they get some big music festivals and other exciting events that smaller cities like Pittsburgh don't get. 

As a kid, I wasn't a fan of PA because it wasn't the big glamorous places like NYC or LA, but now that I'm older, I've lived other places and pay more attention to things like safety, outdoors, history and overall cost/pleasure of living, Pennsylvania is a great state.

"I was a Sergeant with my city's Transit Enforcement department. I was just making casual rounds when I overheard a lady scream profanities at one of my officers. I walked over to provide back up and she started cussing me out too. She was upset because the officer had asked her not to smoke in the train station and was ""harassing"" her. She was cussing me out for standing there. Lots of ""blah blah, fuck you, get a real job"" the typical daily abuse we dealt with. I hadn't really said anything to her until she told my officer to call her supervisor so that she could file a complaint against him for unlawfully harassing her. 

I stepped in and identified myself as the Seargent, and highest person on duty at the time, she didn't skip a beat and began complaining about how the officer had unlawfully harassed her for just smoking and how unprofessional he was. I don't think she realized that I had just witnessed her entire performance. I simply pointed to the ""no smoking"" signs that were nearby. I also thanked her for letting me know that my officers were doing their job. I pointed out that she could have received a citation for smoking, but the officer was just trying to give her a verbal warning. 

I then wrote her a cite for causing a public disturbance (not because she cussed at us, but because her cussing and demeanor caused several other patrons to move away from her) and kicked her out of the station. "

I make roughly 25% on parts. At the same time I also pay for everything. It still works out to be better though compared to what shops are willing to pay.

"Spirited Away

Edit: Lots of people asking why.  It's hard to pin down.  It just gave me this feeling of melancholy.  The ending particularly left me without a moment of closure to cap off the feelings the film gave me, so instead I was left thinking on them.  At the finale when Chihiro and Haku are talking one last time, and he says not to look back, it didn't really hit me that I wouldn't see the bathhouse or the characters there, or Haku again.  When the camera angle changes and Chihiro is walking to the gate to her parents, it's a quiet moment where I was thinking about the story and everything that happened.  I realized I wasn't going to get a final, Disney-esque shot to cap it all off.  It was a weird feeling.  

It made me think a lot about why it made me feel that way, and why exactly it felt so strange.  Wasn't it supposed to make me feel relieved and happy that she got to go home with her parents?  It just put me in this mood where I was thinking about what I was feeling and why, and it made me think about other times where I expect to feel a certain way about something, and then I do; am I feeling that way because I expected to?  It hard to really put it into words, but it put me into this introspection where I was questioning what it meant to get happiness out of something, and how expecting that happiness before you really understand what the result will be can cause discomfort if things play out differently."

"I made a post on Reddit in /r/relationships about my dad on a throwaway account, expressing in pure brutal honesty how I felt about him.

"&gt; when it's just me and another person

That's the only time I *do* have social skills. When I'm with a group, all I do is listen. I realize after a few minutes that I'm the only one not saying anything, and I basically have to force myself to find something to say.

When I'm just one on one, though, I have no problems. I'll find something that I know the person is interested in, or a local event, or recent weather, anything to get a conversation started, and just go from there.

Just remember, sometimes you're simply not going to hit it off with someone. And if *they* don't work to carry the conversation too, then you shouldn't feel bad when things crash and burn. If you're the only one asking questions, and all they're doing is talking about themselves, that's a conversation from which you just need to take your leave. "

"If they prioritize the friend over the SO. 

Example:  I know a couple where the guy has boundary issues.  He needs to be needed.  He's married to a strong, capable woman.  He will go through streaks of getting this ""white knight"" fix by making friends with female coworkers.  Usually one will become his special one.  His current one even refers to him ""jokingly"" as her surrogate husband.  Yes, she's also married.  But her husband is mostly away.  So when she has anxiety attacks, when she has a flat tire, when she's needing help with anything or when she wants to go to the bar, she calls my friend's husband.  He does more with this woman, and does more at her house, than he does with/for his wife at their house.  I can't understand this because he does this, cycle after cycle, and has done this since the beginning of their marriage.  He has lied about where he was; he puts her emotional needs above his wife and daughter's.  ""She's just a friend and she needs me.""  And I wonder, but what about your *family*? "

So I met this (established) group of adventurers as a start of a new campaign. One character had a real flametongue, and he boasted that it had saved his life numerous times, and that it was such a unique weapon.

My character intervened here and said something like ""Rare, maybe, but not unique. Look!"" and pulled his short sword and dagger, emblazoned in flames. He put them away again, went to the ranger (one of the walking tank variety), and said ""and there is another one, too"", rolled a successful deception/pick pocket roll (to draw that guys sword before he could intervene), pulled that rangers longsword, and let it burst in flames: ""Look!"".

"How being poor drains you of motivation and self-respect, and makes opportunities harder to take. How eating shit food and living in a shit place makes you feel like shit and how hard it can be to break out of that. 

People who have always been rich have never felt that, so they assume that being poor is just the same as being rich without having money, and that if they were ever poor they would just work their way out of it while remaining chipper. But it's not that easy, having no money is insidious and it affects your whole outlook and personality.  

On a more positive note, how once you get some money you have an iron determination to never be poor again, which can make you work harder and better than the rich kids. Being poor can also give you respect for the value of money, and stops you wasting it. 

Also, when I was poor I was somehow closer to the people who I lived around. We were poor together and we partied together in squats with out of date cider. "

"The suffering of needing something you can't afford: medical treatment, new clothes/shoes, adequate nutritious food, etc... Growing up you may feel you ""need"" a lot of things, but when you REALLY need something, you know, because when you don't get it there is acute suffering.  That suffering is walking to school in shoes with no soles that you repatched with duct tape, not because it was cool, but because you literally had no other option.  Going through a winter with a coat that was cheap when first bought, second hand when you got it two years ago, and doesn't really fit now so you can't zip it shut.  Living on school lunches (at least when I was a kid, they were shitty but they were free, now kids don't even get this so...) and coming home starving and feeling lucky to eat ramen.  Losing teeth because your parents can't afford to get them fixed.  Suffering in sickness because you can't afford medical care.  I've seen both my mother and my sister almost die of disease: pneumonia and scarlet fever because we couldn't afford medical care.

Children suffer the most from this kind of anti-humanity legislation prohibiting universal healthcare.  Adults have fully formed immune systems and rationale.  Children don't and they don't understand what's happening to them or their parents and they don't understand why their parents can't stop the suffering."
"I go through this at least once a month when I'm counting down to payday.

Be mindful of your portion sizes too! I try to stretch everything I make out for 3-4 days.

Here are some ideas:

Breakfast:

Toast and eggs. If you stick to one piece of toast and one egg per meal, you can stretch out a carton and a loaf for almost two weeks. I keep my bread in thee fridge to prevent mold. 

Oats and peanut butter. Buy a bag of quick oats. Make up 1/2 a cup of those and stir in some peanut butter while it's hot. Add fruit if you can afford it.

Lunch:

Brown rice, broccoli, potato. Make up a big batch of brown rice. I buy the broccoli and potato daily or every other day. I aim for sweet potato but whatever is one sale or cheapest works. Pick the small ones and pay with my loose change. It's around $1-$1.50 and is relatively healthy. Add whatever sauce you have in your fridge!

Dinner:

Pasta. Boil up whatever noodles you have, or you can buy a cheap bag for $1. Buy whatever sauce is cheapest or just use butter. I'll try to grab a single tomato or zucchini to add some nutrients.

Dessert:

""That means, *now*!"" he barked. The students, led by a bushy hair girl Ramsay noted, began a mad dash for the cabinet, except for one boy. A skinny boy with dark hair. Oh yes, Ramsay thought. This must be Harry Potter. Ramsay had read the papers and, unlike so many others, didn't think the idea of Voldemort returning was bollocks.

""Professor,"" came a drawling voice from a tall blonde boy Ramsay instantly knew was Draco Malfoy. ""I think you may know my grandfa-

""Piss off,"" interrupted Ramsay. ""I don't care who you know. I don't play favorites in my class."" 

Class resumed at a normal pace. When time was up, students brought up vials of their sample. Overall, they seemed to have done a good job. Granger and Nott had the best results but Ramsay thought the others weren't worth comment except for one. 

""Mr. Potter, this is not satisfactory. Even Longbottom has a shade of brown. Sure, it's lumpy and smells like shit, but this is turquoise. Explain."" 

Harry says nothing but unintentionally had his right hand out. And it was bleeding again. 

""Sir, let him go!"" begged Hermione.  

""Your hand, NOW, Potter!"" snapped Ramsay. The Potter boy groaned and raised his hand. Ramsay's brows furrowed further. There were deep cuts on the boy's hand and there was dried blood in each space between the boys fingers. Ramsay was astonished that he was able to hold a wand, let alone measure potion ingredients.  

""Who did this?"" asked the potions expert. Potter said nothing. 

""Potter, unless you want me to report this to Headmaster Dumbledore, tell me who did this.""

""Professor Umbridge, sir,"" shouted out the Weasley boy. Potter shot him a dark look. Ramsay nodded and stood up, grabbing his wand and his cloak. 

""Alright, this is fucking serious. Up to the medic, I mean, to the hospital, this instant,""  said Ramsay. He pushed past Granger and Weasley and began to march the stairs. It was 11:40. He had five minutes to get to Umbridge before she would sit at the Head Table for lunch. 

But first, he needed to send an owl. 

**One commercial break later...**

*Scene-Great Hall. 12:04*

""Dolores, may I have a word? I had trouble with that Potter boy in class today,"" asked Professor Ramsay. Umbitch eagerly followed Ramsay into the Entrance Hall. Students are gathered in the Hall, talking about Quidditch, whether or not McGonagall or Snape was the tougher teacher and various other rubbish. 

Ramsay cleared his throat and shot out his wand with a bang. The entire Hall went quiet. Umbridge jumped. 

""Just what the bloody hell do you think you are?"" snaps Ramsay. 

""I'm not sure I heard you correctly,"" said Umbridge. 

""Bloddy hell, did I stutter?"" yells Ramsay. ""You're fucking torturing these kids."" Umbridge paled and cleared her throat. 

""*Hem, hem,* I assure you, Professor, all my teaching methods and discipline, are approved by the Minister,"" said Umbridge in a sickly, sweet voice. ""Now, let's calm down and have some fudge."" 

""Fuck, think you're joking,"" yelled Ramsay. ""I'll teach you what happens to those who *attack my kids!* He raised his wand and shot a curse at Umbridge. Before she could even think, Umbridge found herself flying through the air and slammed against a wall. As she staggered to her feet, pink bow askew, the foul teacher burped out a foot-long slug.

"When I was 13 I was watching that movie in my living room when I received a call from my best friend. He told me his older brother just died in an accident. 

This was *right* before the final battle scene. 

I had watched dozens of people die in the movie up until that point, but it didn't really hit me until that call. "
"So out where I live it's just outside of a town nestled at the bottom of mountains (FYI I live in Australia) and it's not too secluded since I live with my family and you'll generally come across someone's property every 500 metres but there are some stretches where you won't see a house for a km. One night my mum and I are coming home pretty late at night and we we're just talking and listening to the radio. We come around a corner and we both saw this fucking creature that I still don't know what it is till this day. But it had the body the size of a medium dog, mangy looking black fur, an almost abnormally large head, big green eyes (which was the first thing I noticed) but most weirdly an almost impossibly long and thin neck, like it shouldn't be able to support the large head. My mother and I are fucking cussing like sailors at this point and make a u-turn around to get a better look at it, and within 10 seconds there was no trace of it. Normally I'd brush this off as probably a wild dog but the body just didn't look like a dig and it was too big for a cat, even a wild one. The real scary part is that my family and I have seen that maybe two to three times now almost exclusively late at night. However my SO's father has said that he's also seen it twice, once at night and once at daytime and I get the feeling we're not the only people in town to have seen it.

"Reading this sub as a an ex-sex worker is a real eye opener. 

I had to go to a trade school and pay tuition to get a certificate so I could practice sex work. I had to pay for a licence and a yearly registration and I had to pay for mandatory testing and endorsements, and continual personal development courses. Heck my tafe also trained nurses and counsellors - when I was done with my certificate I actually had half a nursing degree, so I studied nursing and while working as a sex surrogate. It was my goal and I worked hard to be able to accept money for sex.

The discussions of prostitution in this thread feels like it's from another point in time. 

I always thought that legalising and regulating the sex industry would reduce the amount of people forced into it by circumstance. But clearly not. "
"Yup, and it's not uncommon in french families from what I've heard, and experienced myself.

A typical ""extended family Sunday lunch"" will begin around 11AM, where people start setting up stuff, taking out the white wine, or rosé (or Pastis if you're from the south of France) or even beer, nibbling on olives, cheese cubes, saucisson (sausage doesn't sound right, even though that's the translation), peanuts, pistachios and whatnot. People start gathering around, helping themselves to a nice glass of wine, and start talking about what's new, whose child got his driver's license, or got a good grade and whatnot.

It's not until about 12/12:30 that the starters actually come through, and they will be eaten until 1/1:30PM.

Then comes the main course, the hearty part of the meal, and all the red wine that comes with it. Various topics are now filling the soundscape, and there could be 3, 4 or 5 discussions happening simultaneously, depending on the number of persons around the table.

Around 3/3:30PM comes a little digestive (alcohol) to make the main course slide down easier. People talk and are having way too much fun, because they've been drinking for a solid 4 hours by now.

At 4/4:30PM comes the dessert, and whatever alcohol that goes well with it (Ice cream and rhum maybe, liquor and cake, I'm no expert on that). By 5/6PM, people are done eating, but they still hang around at the table, drinking yet another digestive while the kids have already given up on the meal and have been trying to leave the table for the past 3 hours. The old people just keep sitting there and talking until the sun sets.

It's basically a day-long meal, that's quite massive overall, but since you eat it over such a long period of time, it just never stops and doesn't really feel like a single meal. My brother had a friend with a family like that, and he knew that when that friend said ""I've got family coming over on Sunday"", it meant that he would have to wait until 4 or 5PM AT LEAST, until he could be free and come play with my brother."

"My father grew up with my uncle in the deep south during the 1960s and like most other white men, the culture and racist values that came along with that engulfed both of them. My father had the fantastic opportunity to join the army and venture into the exciting world and a lot of those teachings wore off. Unfortunately, for my uncle, well, let's just say he never got to travel or experience anything beyond 50 miles of his neck of the woods down in Alabama.

My father had me and my older brother, and my uncle had three daughters.

During the 80s, a small wave of the progressivism (idk if that's a word) and free-love from California somehow made it down to my uncle's place and one of my cousins married a black dude. 

Uh-oh.

Eventually, they had a baby, and all hell broke loose (as if it didn't before). My uncle disowned his daughter and promised to shoot any one of us who sided with them if we came onto his property.  

My father just told me to always keep quiet about the entire ordeal. (I was young anyways so I didn't even understand much of the drama, just that I wasn't allowed to speak about my cousin or her family or the cutie-pie they had.)

One summer I remember, my uncle muttering ""Goddamn whore [my cousin] ... just poppin' out nigger babies one after another. I don't know where I went wrong."" 

My uncle abhorred their son.  He never spoke to them ever again (that my father/I know of), they sent pictures which he burned and he totally just shunned them out of his life.

My family kept in touch with them over the years, and as more years went by and people traveled their separate paths, well, let's just say, my second cousin (my cousin's son) turned out to be a fucking genius.

Just recently graduated a few years back rank 4 in his undergraduate class at Wharton, had his own little start-up which pulled in over half a million in revenue with his buddies, and currently pursuing Computational something or another and Business at MIT.

Apparently, my uncle had kept a close track of them via Facebook/social media over the years before he died back in 2013 from cancer. I was with him during his last few years and one day, I remember seeing a small trail of tears from his eyes when he was looking through a picture album and I distinctly remember clear as day, him whispering to me ""I wish I had gotten a chance to know that boy."""

"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

When I was in college, I was elected treasurer of the school's theatre club my junior year. The rest of the club's leadership was awful, but the previous leadership was even worse, so much so that the club was in the negative when we started the year.

I made it my personal mission to get the club's finances in order. I organized and led fundraisers, double and triple counted funds, and worked directly with the club president as well as the school to more than quadruple our club's starting balance (which the school gave us every year regardless of the previous year's balance).

In the process, I also stole about $700. It was actually pretty easy; I'd just wait until I was alone cleaning up after fundraisers and I'd skim off $20-$60 here and there. The money I stole went towards personal bills anyway, and since the club leadership had a habit of shutting me out of most major decisions about the club (or deciding at the last minute they needed things like petty cash, a process that usually took at least a day and required me to miss classes running all over campus to get various approvals for it), I felt vindicated in doing so. They never noticed since I was the one who counted all the money, and since the surplus was so enormous compared to the previous year. It was hilarious hearing that I was probably the best treasurer the club had had in a decade because I was so meticulous about accounting.

I still have no guilt. The only reason I didn't run for treasurer the following year and do it again was because I didn't want to deal with another year of having my opinions totally ignored by the rest of the club's leaders.

I'm 17 now, but recently it's more cause I don't really like cake or sweets much. But back then when I was younger, it really hurt not getting anything, even though it really shouldn't have mattered, it did for me at that age. But my parents couldn't afford to get a cake for me.

He played video games the rest of the time. I still had to clean the house. 

I asked him to take my clean work shirts out of the dryer and fold them because I needed them for the next day. Next day I can't find them. Not in the dryer, not in the dresser, they just disappeared. Finally after tearing apart the house, I find them in the bottom of a basket of dirty clothes by the washer and dryer. He had taken all the dirty clothes out of the basket, took my shirts out of the dryer, put them in the bottom of the basket and put the dirty clothes back in. Simply because he didn't want to fold them. There was 5 work shirts in that dryer. I bet it took him longer to do that then to just fold the damn shirts.

"This is coming to the thread late, but I'll add my contribution anyway.  - Do not offer any criticism towards the officiant/ priest/pastor. 

I know you might want to, and you might even feel justified in pointing out any mistakes that they made, but the wedding and reception is just not a good time to do that. 

My father was a pastor and he did our wedding. After it was over I kind of poked some fun at him during the reception about how he forgot to present us as ""husband and wife"" at the end. Also he kind of preached a little bit long, when we specifically ask him to keep it short, and I couldn't help but point that out. I was trying to tease him, but I think I came off as a little mean. 

A few days later, my brother told me that my dad was really beating himself up over that. He honestly and deeply wanted to give us the best wedding he possibly could. I felt really  ashamed that I mentioned anything to my dad about it.
A few years later my dad was diagnosed with dementia. He was probably showing the early signs of it years before. 

I don't think about it everyday, but it's quite often that I look back and cringe with regret about how I acted. I told him many times how I was just kidding, and that he did a wonderful job, but it just sounded like damage control at that point.

"My dad said the same thing when I left college. He said I ""didn't have enough hustle"" because I told him over and over that's not how it works anymore. He last applied for a job in 1987, so I didn't blame him for not realizing how much stuff had changed since then. He eventually figured it out and was much less hard on me for taking forever to find a decent job. Part of that was me showing him the process I had to go through to even apply for jobs--all the bullshit repetition (filling out all the boxes that are covered on my resume) and personality tests and all that crap. He was amazed at how in-depth and time-consuming applications for even retail jobs are these days. "

"I cant remember were to find the exact video, and I really dont want too. But I remember I saw this unedited video of an ISIS execution in Iraq about 1/2 years ago.

They were lining all these guys up against a wall to be shot (honestly a much more human and less gory than most ISIS execution videos). But I remember how some men were crying, others were praying, others nervous, some stoic. You could actually hear the what the men were saying (I didnt understand though as I dont speak Arabic).

But one thing that stuck was there were these two guys. One kid looked maybe 12/13, the other looked maybe 17/18, holding hands. They were probably brothers or something. The 12 year old was crying, and when they were lined up against the wall, the 18 year old, you could see was wiping his 12 year olds tears off, grabs his head and stares him in the eye and says something too him, and then he hugs his face into his chest, stars stroking his little brothers hair and closes his eyes, and you could also see his mouth moving, but no sound was coming, so he was probably praying. A few seconds later, everyone is executed. 

Ive seen plenty of gory executions and such but seeing (presumably) one brother try and comfort another brother, knowing it is the end and that there is no way out, really bothered me for a while. Its much less gory but personalizes those killed so much better."

"Not guaranteed though. An old boss went through something like this. The mom fed the daughter lies for over a decade. When she turned 18 and he could stop paying childcare, he offered to help her with college if he could. 

She turned him down and started throwing all sorts of vile shit at him that for the most part, we could verify as not being true. Because she had ""dates"" for all of it. Some of it very recent. 

The only problem with her stories were that we were a close-knit group of workers and spent time at each other's houses quite often. But, having been told lies from the get-go, she believed everything her mom told her. 

She ended up turning into quite the monster herself and wound up in jail from drugs and molestation charges. "

"Holy fuck, and I thought I was a deep sleeper.  One time, I fell asleep on the plane, and the flight crew couldn't wake me up after we'd landed.  It was their last flight of the night, so they just let me chill on the plane.  I woke up just after midnight, confused as fuck as to why the plane was empty.  Got out of the plane, and was even more terrified when the ONLY sign of life in the airport were the automated floor-cleaners.  Wondered if I was unwittingly cast into a horror movie or something.  Keep wandering around the airport until I find my terrified and relieved father who had been waiting to pick me up.  This was before I had a cellphone, so it's not like my father or I could call each other."

"I'll keep it short because it's a long story as I said. I think we can all agree or somewhat agree that the media has a HUGE influence in defining our perception of other ethnicities based on how they're represented in the news or hollywood type media. Well, looking back, I was a damn idiot. I based my perceptions of blacks and Hispanics off stupid stereotypes that don't really have much truth to it if you actually spend time with them. I also think this depends on your location. I noticed this first hand working along side my wife and other coworkers who weren't white. Working with these guys I know  regardless of race I know that people are people. Everyone is out here working to make it in this world. Yeah, we are different in our own ethnic backgrounds but in the end it's all the same. It's just expressed differently from my perspective of things and that's ok. My wife's from 3rd ward of Houston and I'm from the boonies. Nothing in common of upbringing but she took the initiative in bridging that gap between us when I was still a bit stubborn but really attracted to her back then (still attracted). Her introducing me to her friends and a few of her family definitely opened me up a lot to people who I probably never would have even acknowledged if I didn't meet my wife. We spent hours just messaging each other on Facebook which eventually led to sleeping over each other's places after work. She would go into these what I call verbal thesis of prejudice and ignorance which fuels the subconscious fear people have that are different from them. Maybe she brainwashed me, I don't care. What I know is  learning from others who aren't similar to me made me very humble, curious to learn more, and overall prefer their company both at work and off work. On my side, when they found out I was marrying a black girl back then, no one but a couple of my friends supported it.  A few of my relatives behind closed doors didn't really care and kind of supported it but when the family is around, I'm a ""animal lover who fucks monkies."" Stuff like this made my blood boil and got into a few fist fights with a couple family members but in the end, I just let it go because it's not worth it and they're crazy enough to kill me. I haven't spoken to them for 4 1/2  years.  I'm with the woman I love and I can start new and hopefully my past will never catch up to me. "

In the past two years it has turned out that he had either raped, harassed or molested a few of the women in my extended family.  When it all came out and that one memory surfaced in my head. I don't remember him actually doing anything to me. I am male, so I don't think he would do anything to me. I know that some people block out memories and traumatic events.

"Backstory: I'm an only child, and my parents are separated and have been for a long time. My dad was abusive to my mom so there's no contact between them. 

I recently received a message from a girl who claims we may be half-sisters. She was born about 10 months after I was born, in the same town, and her mom went to the same high school as my parents and graduated the same year (my parents had me at a very young age- basically right out of high school- so that's why that's relevant). 

She was very nice (didn't seem crazy) and we talked about a few other things that make it seem like it may be legit. We also ended up living about an hour and a half from each other in Florida even though we were both born in Ohio, so we're going to be meeting and getting a DNA test soon. 

I'm not too phased about it, at first I felt pretty shitty thinking about my dad cheating on my mom (if it is true, he cheated on her when I was ~1 month old, and that's a pretty shitty thing) but honestly there are so many other, shittier things that happened to my mom because of my dad that at this point it's not world-shattering by any means.

I'm not telling him because I don't think he'd really care, or wouldn't really know what to do at this point since we're all adults now (I'm 24). I also don't really want this girl meeting my dad since he's definitely not what she's been hoping her father is.

And obviously I'm not telling my mom because it would just open new wounds and hurt her even more. 

*But* I guess to end on a good note, taking the DNA test will give this girl closure. She also mentioned how she has siblings, but they are much younger than her, so having a relative that's closer in age would be really nice, and as long as she's cool, I have no problem with that."

"Two horse related stories. Also, buzzed so forgive any mild incoherence.

1) A horse that had most of its legs ground off by  several miles of road.

My friend's dad had two horse trailers. One was nice but large, the other was a single horse trailer and somewhat old. It had a wooden floor.

My friend figured he'd use that one to take his horse out to our place. 

At some point, while he was driving, the trailer floor gave out in such a way as to drop all four of the his horse's legs through the floor and on to the concrete. There's no telling how many miles went by where that horse's legs were just scraped away by the road. He stopped when someone flagged him down to let him know that there was something wrong with his trailer.

The horse was missing everything from about the knee down. There was blood everywhere along with chunks and horse poop. It looked like the horse had fought quite a bit to get out. It was pretty hellish.

It was dying when I got there and he'd told me what happened beforehand - and told me to bring a gun.

2) A showhorse trailer full of horses hit by a train.

Did you you that when a fast moving freight train hits a trailer full of horses, the screams of the dying horses sound like the screams of a thousand dying children? 

I didn't, until then. 

The train hit, followed instantly by the most horrific screams I've ever heard, then nothing but the shriek of metal wheels on rails as the train grinds to a stop. The smell...diesel fuel, overheated train brakes, blood, horse poop, and piss. None of the horses survived. One was ripped in half, another had been crushed and was unrecognizable. The back two were bleeding from their noses, eyes, mouths, and ears and were twitching. 

The screams though. High octane nightmare fuel."

I got scammed out of a not insignificant amount of money in eBay a few years ago (as a seller). Sent them a few emails about it, all of which were automated and had something like ""*Please reply to this email if you need further assistance*"". Did it every single time; no response. Opened a case or whatever it's called on their site about the issue. They offered to refund any listing fees for the inconvenience. Of course, there were no listing fees. They might as well have said ""*We're sorry. To help make this right, we're going to give you nothing. Have a nice day, asshole*"".

In retrospect, I should have called them and spoke to someone instead of relying on emails. But I was like 17 at the time. Still, fuck eBay. "

"FWIW sometimes its because a firm is 'overqualified' to carry out work . 

Maybe on a job that requires more skill than just cutting and clearing and needs actual landscaping etc then they can justify charging 15,000.  So they have a choice of which jobs to take and if  there's jobs that will pay them 15,000 for a days work then there's no point them offering to do a day's work for you then less than 15.000.

Where maybe the old guy who can only clear and remove is never going to get those 15000 jobs so he charges at rate that works for him."

Unclipped a plug, removed two screws, tossed old part, reversed everything as I installed new part.  Problem fixed.  Almost took me more time to empty the glovebox than to exchange the part.

Almost $500 saved, because some stranger with my exact model of car and my exact problem was nice enough to video themselves solving the problem.  Thanks Internet fix-it stranger!"

"I'll preface this by saying I, myself, have not been to an orgy, but a close friend of mine goes monthly and has told me all about it at length, as I was curious.

I wasn't going to post, but people seem to be saying that basically everyone involved will be ugly, sleazy, or socially inept, and from what I hear, this isn't true (at least not for this particular orgy). I just wanted to clear that up.

This particular orgy is 'curated' by a couple and is a repeated event; they are particular and choose people that they, themselves, would like to enjoy an orgy with, as they also partake.

My friend is what I'd describe as a 'handsome devil', and by his accounts, the other men and women involved are also handsome devils, or very pretty devilettes, respectively.

So, just to be clear, there isn't just a flier on a bus stop that points people in the direction of an orgy; they are (often) curated by some kind of organiser that hand-picks suitable candidates.

I know this doesn't answer your question, OP, but for some reason I wanted it known that orgies aren't always the grotesque, craigslist-sourced flesh puddle that people are making them out to be."

Also, the cold. Not quite scary or creepy per se, but when the heating's off, it's winter, it's Wales, the radiator slowly loses its warmth, you're wearing 3 jumpers and 3 pairs of socks but the cold buries itself into your chest, it's so cold the bones in the top of your feet hurt like hell and you don't know if you should be worried about that, and you're scared you won't sleep because the floor's so hard and you can't stop shivering but you need to sleep if you want to escape this nightmare existence.


Also knowing that the people you never thought you could relate to, but now identify with are doing worse. In the freezing rain, not with a lot of the knowledge you've sadly now got, unwashed, addicted to heroin (Proud Swansean) and dying.

"From [this post](https://redd.it/6j71ll):

&gt; i am a gay man and i accidentally masturbated to straight porn. i was browsing a gay porn site, so you know, i figured there wouldn't be any women in my gay porn. i found one video whose thumbnail looked promising so i clicked on it and it started mid-sex. the bottom was facedown into the bed in some black lace dress. that should have been a big warning sign, but i assumed it was some sissy fetish thing. not my cup of tea, but the top was hot and really going to town on her so i stuck around.   
  
&gt; after the guy (and i) finished, the girl sat up and that's when i saw it... _her tits_. you should have seen my face. a visage of true terror. i just sat there in shock, contemplating what i had just done. when i broke free of my stupor, i whispered ""no hetero"" but i fear it wasn't enough"

So I met this girl on tinder and have her over for a mini second date at the end of the semester. The rooms were set up for 3 people in one room connected to another room of 3 guys on the other side. One roommate was already home for break and the other let me have the room for the night with the girl. The other guys were still in their room which was cool. Only thing was is that this girl was on her period and tried flushing her pad down the toilet in a big wad of paper towel. After she uses the toilet we shut the door and start watching a movie. We hear commotion in the bathroom but just ignore it until I get texts in the group message that her pad flooded the toilet. Eventually a girl down the hall picked it up off the ground with a hangar and threw it out. They even bleached the bathroom floor. I went in there after and apologized. The worst part was when I had to tell the girl what happened to make sure she didn't do it again. She felt terrible and was embarrassed. Still got blown tho
"I think thats the differences of prayer actually. Some pray for things, some pray to give thanks, some pray to simply acknowledge.

More in the sense of i cant do this by myself, i know you can help, please help me through this"
At least once a week. We were a small store. I'm sure in other stores it happened more often. A store down the street from us had a regular customer fire off a round while looking for a holster. It was a lady that was a regular at our store too and just a few days later she was in our store and admitted that it happened but acted like it was no big deal.
My friend is a little person. One time when we were out a little girl asked her why she was so short. She told the girl that her shoes ate her feet and the bottoms of her legs and we kept walking. I looked back to see the little girl frozen in fear looking at her feet.

"I was at a Mexican restaurant with my girlfriend and while we were looking at the menu I asked her what she was thinking of getting, she said the fajitas looked good. I jokingly said that I believe it's pronounced fa-gite-as (without the soft j, so it sounds kinda like vagina). So for the next 10 minutes I kept talking about fajitas while mispronouncing it. Finally when the waiter took her order she accidentally used the pronunciation I kept using, (probably because I had said fa-gite-as at least 30 times)  I cracked up while the waiter very innocently repeated back her order the correct way. It remains to be one of my greatest accomplishments. "
"It can really seem like a horror movie at times. I have a relative who has Alzheimer's. My cousin takes care of her and she told me one of the most unsettling stories I've ever heard:

Alzheimer's relative walked into a room in her own house. She comes back into the living room telling my cousin how scared and frightened she is. My cousin asks what happened. Relative says she's afraid of ""the woman"" in her room.

The ""woman"" was her own reflection in the mirror all along.


Of course it's not all deep cases like that. Sometimes the saddest instances are the simplest ones. Just a week or two ago she came to my graduation party and she went to use the bathroom. Before she came back out she was standing in the doorway for seconds longer than any normal person would. She didn't know how to use the light switch to cut the light off.


The very saddest moment I've seen was from that same day. She went to hug my grandfather before her and her husband left the party. Looked nice. Pretty normal. Later on my grandpa tells us that she whispered something to him during that hug. She had whispered: ""I've missed you so much.."" Now sure you could say Alzheimer's has nothing to do with that and normal people say that all the time, but it just came off that she said that to him as if she was ""aware"". It's just such a shame because she used to be such a character. I remember we would have Halloween over at her place and as a kid I'd dump out all my candy and she'd crack a joke like ""Alright let's make sure we shift through to check for poison and razor blades"" and it was always like a light was on. But it doesn't seem that way anymore and it's so unreal."
"When I was 14. My best friend's mom dated this one abusive asshole. One night he had one too many drinks, came home to my best friend, my best friend's 4 siblings, her mom and myself.  

We were all watching a movie in the living room while she sat doing paper work in the kitchen. That's when he began banging on the door and broke it down. She threw blankets over us before he made it up the stairs, told us to stay still and proceeded to scream and shout as he threw her around.  

Best friend's younger brother and I ran for the phone. Kept me on the line until 4 officers arrived and it took 3 of them to bring him down. He managed to crack her cheek bone, chip a tooth, give 3 of her ribs hair line fractures and had 8 stitches on her crown from a bookshelf falling on her before the police even made it there. Ambulance arrived and took her to the hospital. Mom came to pick me up.

"I got someone fired for sexual harassment once. It was a total nightmare. He was my former gms boyfriend. She got him a job at her store but he was having problems with the other employees there so they transferred him to our store. 

Before all of that, my old gm, her bf , my bf and i would hang out a lot. I was good friends with her especially,  like told her a lot about my life and we got a long really well. Then after she transferred, she randomly would text semi flirty things to my bf. I never confronted her about it but him and i just stopped hanging out with her and her bf.

Then her bf started at my job. I was basically the only girl working there at the time.. His behavior started small, brushing up against me. At first i thought it was innocent. Then one day i was doing dishes, which was really easy there and didn't require 2 people. He came over and started helping. At one point i felt his hand completely on my ass, like almost palming it. I jerked away and didnt say anything.. i have ptsd  from childhood sexual abuse so i felt like frozen i guess. 

Then he literally pushed his crotch on my ass under the guise of reaching for something  (that he didnt need to reach for). And was constantly touching my ass. I was terrified to go to work, i was having multiple anxiety attacks every day.

So i told my new gm. He believed me right away, cause that dude i guess was making super sexual comments about female customers to the point where an ALL MALE STAFF felt uncomfortable. He let me leave early, talked to the owner and they sat down and fired the guy. Only the owner told him it was me who complained  (which i mean there was like one part time other female night employee so it was obviously me but still).

Cue my old gm telling my new gm I'd gotten people fired at other jobs for this (not true, although during a door to door job i had briefly i was grabbed by this old dude who i was trying to sell the product to, and i had to quit, but thats NOT THE SAME THING) and that I'm not her bfs type, I'm making it up, yadiyada. And then the dude who had done it also texted ME calling me a liar and shit. 

Idk why I'm telling this story but tldr, being sexually harassed SUCKS ."

"As she should be, over-diagnosis is becoming a real problem, especially when we are rarely taking severity in account. Take autism for example:

When I was a kid, I was diagnosed with Asberger's, which is now just part of the autism spectrum. But other than some small things you'd pick up on in person, I doubt people would know I'm technically autistic. Yet there are also autistic people who haven't made it past a fourth grade education even as adults, will hurt themselves if their arms aren't restrained, are completely nonverbal, etc. 

We need a better tier system, as depression for one person can be *completely different* then depression for another, and medicating them all is the wrong answer. "

Rule 1.2: The driver also has the ability to revoke said rights of tunes.
"Not allowed a key until I was 18 (or was it 16? Can't remember), yet nobody would be home once I got back from school so I would spend a lot of time 'hanging around' outside. I would usually be expected to be waiting outside, though sometimes it was forgotten this was a rule so I would go to the local library. 

Even once I was given a key, I wasn't allowed to stay home alone and had to vacate if they were. 

Once, I lost my key (turns out my cousin had it in his pocket but he forgot). My Stepdad said we would have to change the locks as 'someone might find them and rob the house' and when my Mum got home, she demanded I go and look for the keys again. I refused as I'd spent hours looking and knew I wouldn't be able to find them. She then demanded my phone, so I refused and sat on it. 

So then she gave me a long, hard look, picked up a box of trinkets on my bookcase and turned it over while staring at me. After I didn't react, she trashed more stuff in my room until I started to scream and shout at her, swearing (I didn't usually swear at her but the years of abuse meant I would burst into anger when she started on me), asking her what was wrong with her. 

While I screamed at her, she stopped and laughed at me incredulously, asking me in a calm voice when was wrong with ME. Then she said in a low threatening voice ""find your fucking keys"" and left. 

So yeah, not the only ridiculous rule they had, but one that sticks out the most.

Also, my bag was searched every morning before school and I wasn't allowed to wear short puffa jackets or jackets without arms.

"A while back, Disney World used to host ""Grad Night"" for graduating high school seniors. Basically, it was where they kept the Magic Kingdom open all night and it was only open to seniors. They had a pretty strict dress code (coats and ties for the guys, dress/skirt/pants for the ladies – no jeans, t-shirts, etc.). There was also a required student to chaperone ratio of 10:1 or something like that. One chaperone always had to be ""on duty"" in a designated area and the other chaperones were allowed to wander the park. They switched off every hour or so. I lived in Miami at the time, so our school always went. Needless to say, it was one of the major events of senior year.

The year my brother graduated (1988) a couple of guys from his class were caught shoplifting. Security nabbed them almost instantly and took them to ""jail"". From what they told me, it was basically a security office...nothing themed, no bars or locks...just a room where they made you sit until they could figure out what to do with you.

Security ended up going to the on duty chaperone and brought her down to security where she had to identify and ""take custody"" of the two guys. The paperwork was intense, too. IIRC, they were both personally banned for a year. They had to spend the rest of the night in the chaperone area.

The next year, it was my class's turn. Rumor was that the entire school had been banned because of this incident and our headmaster (private school) had to formally petition for us to be allowed back.

Probably more story than you wanted, but yeah...it exists, but it’s not much different than being caught by mall security."

"It's the worst thing I've ever done in my entire life, I can't forgive myself. I am a garbage person and am a terrible excuse for a man.  About 1.5 years ago my wife and I got into a huge argument in a car and she told me to stop the car but I didn't. She then tried to leave while I was still driving and I grabbed and hit her out of nowhere? I did have anger issues but everything went red for a second, I processed what I had done stopped the car and we just sat there as she cried. I don't why I did it, but I did and have to live with it. I haven't hurt her since that day but we've argued since. I just don't know how to atone for my mistake? I was raised in an abusive household but that's not an excuse! I promised myself I wouldn't be my father but here I am, I'm no better. I love this woman and yet I hurt her when my duty was to protect her. "

He asked him to play out the track at the very popular and viewed musical festival that happened this prior weekend called Electric Forest. Long story short; RL Grime actually played his song out at the music festival! It was really dope to see the community supporting one another and actually getting someone who is famous and super loved on the subreddit drop his song!"

"Benjamin Button hit me in the feels for a multitude of reasons.

First off, the amount of sacrifice he has to make in his life is incredible. I obviously can't relate to the age thing as a reason why it happens so often to him, but I often will let something go that I know deep down I deserve. My problem is that I convince myself I don't deserve. Sounds counter-intuitive to say, ""I know I deserve it, but I don't think I do."" And it is.

The second thing is that the movie is done in retrospect, with Benjamin as the narrator. I often feel like I am watching my own movie, and in many regards, so is he.

Lastly, the scene where his love interest gets hit by a car and breaks her leg. And then they break down all the things that had to have happened to make her be there in that exact moment. Had she not forgotten her keys, she wouldn't have been back in her apartment to hear the phone ringing, and wouldn't have been delayed, and wouldn't have missed the first taxi that would've been available, etc etc. I think about that shit *constaaaaaaantly*! Is there something I'm doing now that could drastically affect my future? Or what about something I am not doing now that may have an equally impactful...impact? "

""The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness."""

"Want to see something really funny?  Back at my old school, there was this very petite little 55-60 ish lady who used to go to the rec center after hours to socialize and play ping pong.  She would always play pick up ping pong games with the students.  We're talking young, fit, 19-22 year olds.  

The lady in question was a language teacher from the Mandarin Chinese department.  Turns out, back in China, she had once been a ranked player on her college team.

"I spend a decent amount of time in the woods, such as national parks/forests. Every time I take someone else out who isn't as familiar they're scared of things like wolves and bears.

Wolves? Unless you're alone, bleeding, have pissed off the entire pack, and have a t-bone steak hanging around your neck, they won't touch you. Sure, they can fuck you up if they really wanted to, but 99.9999% of the time they just skitter off back into the trees.

Black bears and brown bears are pussies. They want nothing to do with you, and would much rather go munch on some berries or a dead salmon than try and hurt you. Make lots of noise and carry some bear spray + a boomstick just in case, you'll be fine. Mother bears with cubs are the exception to this rule. They will take that can of bear spray and shove it right up your ass.

You know what scares me to no end?

Moose.

Moose look all awkward and gangly, like they're going to topple over at any second because of their stupidly large antlers. You ever seen a moose try and gallop at any sort of decent speed? It's like a stripper with no legs trying to work a pole. You know you shouldn't laugh, but you do anyway.

But make no mistake, moose will end you. Those things have NO fear. Most predators, even if you piss them off something fierce, will *eventually* fuck off if you're faster/get far enough away. Moose don't give a shit. Those sonsabitches will stalk your ass for MILES and won't stop until you're dead if you get on their bad side. And they may look awkward and silly at first, but suddenly they're a lot less so when 1000 pounds of pissed-off venison is trying to rip you from crotch to chin with those antlers. 

And even if you do get away, you'll probably find one of those vengeful bastards fucking your wife/girlfriend when you get home, just so they can prove a point. "

Another time I hooked up with a coworker.   She seduced me on my birthday.   The crazy thing was,  I thought she was a little overweight (I didn't care, she was cool), but when I took of her sweater she was super fit,  just had huge boobs.  I was floored,  I had no idea how hot she was.   At that point it was a bonus, I mean I liked her anyway thinking she was chunky. 

She told me she always dressed in loose clothes to hide her body.   It worked!  She was amazing,  I only stopped dating her because I accepted a job in Japan, I left the country (I told her about it before we even hooked up)."

Her teeth were so far apart that she could have flossed with one of those chains battleships use to drop anchor, and I don't mean she had a gap between her two front teeth. She had that gap between all of her teeth. Her hands were so disproportionately tiny, that it upset me on a level no horror movie ever has. Oh, and her feet were spilling off the sides of her sandals. And the look on Josh's face when he was with her was one of sheer bliss.

This woman was so impossibly ugly that nothing in this entire plane of existence could ever overshadow it. I don't care if she's as smart as Stephen Hawking. I don't care if she's as funny as Robin Williams. I don't care if she cooks like a five star chef. I don't care if she fucks like a sex-starved Julez Ventura on a double dose of ecstasy. I don't care if she wanted to buy me an estate in Tuscany and has the means to do so. There's nothing in this universe that could convince me to get my erect penis anywhere near her.

"I ran into Danny McBride at the San Diego Comic Con last year. 

I was riding the elevator alone in my hotel, when it stops on the floor of the big celebrity party going on that night. The door opens, and standing right there is Danny McBride, Jody Hill, and a few of their friends.

I freaked out. I immediately yelled, ""Oh my god. It's Kenny Fucking Powers!"" I saw plenty of celebrities that weekend, but he is the only one I saw that I fangirled out on. He was wasted. His friends were, too. I asked him for a picture, even though it was a struggle to get the words out. He grabbed my phone, and took a half dozen selfies of all of us in the elevator. All I could muster, over and over, was ""Kenny Fucking Powers!"" He handed me back my phone, put his hands on my shoulders, looked me in the eye, and made some joke about me trying to take a nice vacation and not even knowing comiccon was going to be on that weekend. I put my hands on his waist, so we were positioned like a couple of slow-dancing 8th graders, and said, one final time, ""it's Kenny Fucking Powers!""

It took me a good hour to get over the adrenaline rush, and I now love him more than ever.

"The head RA at my freshman dorm.... It was as if he accepted the job because he hated teenagers so much he wanted to ruin their lives. Since we were a freshman only dorm there was a strict no alcohol policy and he would stay up late waiting in the common room to catch people returning from parties drunk so he could kick them out. 

But that's not why I'm writing this story... He and I had beef after I asked him to get the vending machine fixed. When I told him it was broken he said he'd call someone to get repaired. Every week I politely asked him for an update on the repair and each week he became more and more annoyed by my inquiries. I didn't understand how it could take so long to get a repairman out so after about 5 weeks I started investigating on my own. First I called the university to ask who fills the machines, then I wedged my body between the snack machine and the soda machine until I found the sticker on the back with the company contact info. I called the supplier, they gave me a number for the repair request line, and ONE HOUR LATER someone was fixing the damn vending machine. 

I stood there chatting with the repairman waiting for the head RA to walk by... When he finally did I pointed to the repairman with a shiteating grin on my face and proudly announced that I got it fixed on my own and wouldn't be needing his help anymore. I wish I could describe the look on his face, but he was clearly unhappy. I knew after a month that he was never going to call and get it fixed, just to spite me. He literally used his power to DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING."

"I have (thankfully) never been caught in a compromised situation. However, I did once catch two people in an awkward one.

I was round a friends house for one of those half party things. You know the ones, where it wasn't supposed to be a party, but everyone brought a friend and their friend brought a friend so twenty people showed up. I was early teens at the time.

So anyway, I open the door to the computer room in the interests of playing some video games. And what do I see? Two of my other friends (let's call them ‘Sam’ and ‘Luke’) watching porn, with their hands down their trousers. Or, more accurately, each other's trousers.

There were a lot of people around, and I didn't want anyone else to see the poor bastards, so I quickly shut the door. Unfortunately, I was still in the room when I did so. They both jumped up, and Sam damn near hit the floor.

So here I was, staring at my two half naked friends, listening to them both try to come up with an explanation but only speaking in half words and mumbles, trying not to die of both laughter and embarrassment.

I felt so bad for them. It suddenly dawned on them what had happened, and they both looked at the floor ashamed, as if their mothers were telling them off. I just gave my usual look of ‘none of my business’ with a little shrug. Told them to pull their pants up before someone else came, and left.

The details I was later provided told me this was a common occurrence between the two of them, although I was the only other one that knew. Apparently they're both straight, which judging by their choice of porn might be at least half true.

I don't speak to them anymore, so I don't know much else."

My mother is the cleanest and tidiest person on the planet.

So as a kid, I was completely out of my element when I went to my best friend's house that was always messy. Not insanely dirty, but they always had some dirty dishes on the counter/in the sink, and mail and newspapers on the dining table, and just general clutter here and there, and always a bit dusty. At home, my mom always made me help with chores, and once I told my friend that I hate vacuuming and she said ""why do you vacuum? we don't even have a vacuum""... but their entire house was carpeted!

"I killed my family friend's Tamagotchi pet. This was when they were at its peak craze and everyone had one except for me. I didn't want to ask for one because my family was struggling financially.

I think we were both around 8-9 years old. Basically every time I saw her she was playing with it. One day I was at her house and noticed that she had left in on a table. I started playing with it and I noticed that it would get all annoyed and upset if you shook it. So maybe out of jealousy and frustration I shook the shit out of it until it died. I got really scared because I had no idea it could die so I put it back and ran away. I saw her pick it up and look heartbroken. 

A few years later my family moved and we lost contact with their family. Last year somehow the topic of the girl came up and it turned out she ran away from home at 13, got pregnant at 14 and had all loads of different trouble with drugs for many years. I can only think that the sudden tragic murder  of her Tamagotchi left some kind of serious trauma. "

The loot on the wyvern resulted in us chimping out on each other, though. I remember seeing bullets, a high quality longneck, some armor sets and a flamethrower before one of my constituents clubbed me out and we all turned on each other. 

We could have raided some of the alphas smaller bases, easily ran some caves, really made something and it was all ruined for a journeyman flamethrower with fuel..."

He eventually quit the job, and I can tell you, I've never been so relieved. We genuinely liked each other and I was one of the few people in his life who could tell him what to do - primarily because I'd earned his respect and respect was the only currency he acknowledged.

I could restock the machine for $90 and I never took less than $300 out of it when I emptied the cash. So he really had no reason to complain. 

Tl/dr I used to tighten the claw on the machine at my restaurant because watching young children win was the best.

Edit: someone asked how and I can't find the comment to message back, but basically if you have the key to open a claw machine you can check the top of the claw and their will be a large screw or bolt that maintains tension. Locate the proper tool to tighten this and you will make the claw stay tight when it closes. Many claw machines have this as loose as possible so even if you initially grab a prize it will not stay in the claws grasp. Tighter tension insures a firm grasp and an easier time ""winning"" "

One time I started getting sick at school on a Friday and we had planned a sleepover (ages ago as usual) for that night. I was feeling absolutely awful but tried my best to stay at school because obviously if I went home sick the sleepover would be called off. Made it to lunch and then the teacher called me over and said I was white as a ghost and burning up and had to go home. My best friend and I were devastated. Sad day."

"Made a throwaway for this because I don't want various people close to me to all see it happened and freak out.  I normally only tell it to people I trust who understand.

In this case, it was both something I experienced AND saw.

I had an extremely abusive stepfather when I was young.  He was great until my two half brothers (his children) were born.  This man was quite a sick fellow, as he seemed to get off on beating me.  He was extremely fit for his age, an ex-boxer, and I always had no chance at all.  From age 8-15 pretty much I would get my ass kicked by him at least once a week.  He even came up with elaborate methods to not leave marks, taken right out of the guantanamo bay handbook.  For example he'd force me down then lay a baseball bat and stand on it on my shins, scooting it back and forth a little.  He seemed aroused by hurting me, but never began to inappropriately touch me until I was in my teens.  It seemed I had to be old enough to be physically attractive.

I don't hate my mother because she was so unhappy with him that she was delusional over it all, she'd even convince herself that boys had beaten me even minutes later.  It was terrible to see her mind just breaking from this guy.  I would have called CPS, but he treated my brothers (his children) like gods of course.  I didn't want to sell out their future for my own was the logic in my head back then, it was very fucked up.  At the time I believed CPS would collect all 3 of us (which I think is actually true).

Now for what happened and what I saw.

At age 15 I was finally off home school and into high school, I was also bigger and stronger and this fellow was realizing he both couldn't get away with beating me and that I'd fight back every time and had gotten amazing at it.  I was becoming unworth the trouble in most cases.  I loved being at school- even though I got picked on.  Even the worst day at school as a freshman was heaven compared to when I was at home.  One issue arose though: Summer break.

I knew I was going to really get my ass handed to me on summer break.  On top of that, at this age was when he began to see me as a sexual object, and I sure as hell didn't want to get raped.  My room at this time as as bare as a hotel room and I had a typewriter for entertainment (this was around 2000, no computer for me!).  He'd removed my entire door from the frame because I ""didn't deserve one"".  I decided I needed to draw a line at summer break and have a rumble with him.  So I reinstalled the door (couldn't find knob) and stuffed shoes beneath it to ""lock"" it.  I took my own belt and folded it a few times and sat calmly at the edge of my bed around when he'd get home.

He noticed the door immediately and began screaming like an animal at me, bashing into it and pressing it to get through.  The shoes caught beneath it and stopped, but he began just trying to brute-force shove his way through the ajar door.  So I charged him and began going to town on his face with the metal end of the belt.  This rightly pissed him off, so he broke through and began boxing me in earnest.  I didn't really stand a chance and he had me down in about ten seconds, he knocked the wind right out of me and went for the face after.  We began to wrestle on the floor but I was around his size now and he didn't seem to expect how well I'd do.  At one point we both tried to get up and let go of each other, I grabbed for the belt and we wrestled again against my dresser.  Then I got it around his neck and he put his hand up and got it trapped against his neck.  I began to drag him across the floor like that while choking him, but I could only keep doing it while he was also being dragged.  I did it into the hall and down near the bathroom but he got out of it there and went to town on me again.  I remember almost nothing about our fight at that point.  I don't know how much longer it lasted or what injuries came from where. 

I woke up and it was completely pitch black.  I felt the worst I'd ever felt.  I thought maybe he'd bashed my eyes and blinded me and I began to feel around.  Gradually I realised I was in the bath tub and covered in shards from the sliding glass window.  It was extremely difficult to stand, something seemed wrong with one of my ears and hearing through it and it also affected my balance.  I turned on the light and realised my eyes were okay but my face and chest were absolutely drenched in blood.  I had a broken nose, chipped teeth, and fat hanging from my lip.  I had no clue where my stepdad was.  I very carefully opened the door and listened and watched the hall.  To get out I'd need to pass every single room in the hall, as the bathroom was at the end.  I was in shock and terrified, my longsleeve was actually heavy with blood and I had to keep feeling along the wall to walk even a bit cause I kept keeling over.  He wasn't in any of the rooms so I darted from the hall, through the living room, for the front door.  This took me past the kitchen, where it turned out he was waiting.  At last the long story becomes about what I saw.  

I saw him stripped down to his boxers, sitting on the kitchen counter, drinking tequila from the bottle.  His clothes were on the floor in an open nestled garbage bag.  He had ripped the phone from the wall in the kitchen and smashed it apart on the floor.  He had a saw from the garage plugged in there as if he'd tested it once, and he had the most terrified look on his face I'd ever seen, even before he noticed it.  It almost doubled when he saw me.  To this day I am positive he thought he had killed me in that bathroom.  He was planning to chop my body up and hide it.  There is absolutely zero doubt in my mind what he would have done if I had not woken up at that time.  He was ready to go within a few seconds, maybe a minute at most.  What if I hadn't even made it to the door in that time?

He called for me to wait but I bolted out of the door.  He didn't chase me at all in the street and no one was even around to notice me bleeding despite being in the middle of a suburb, it was around 1pm too.  I went to a payphone at an AM/PM and an employee came out concerned and asking if he should call the cops.  I refused and said I was fine, called a teen help hotline.  Long story short, I got helped down to a youth shelter in the downtown area of where I lived.  I gladly chose to live as a bum for the entire summer break and even into the next schoolyear.  They even got me some medical care for free (in america of all places!).  I could make a massive post about all the wonderful things people did for me in that shelter, but I've rambled on enough.

This was the happiest time of my life at that point.  Reflecting now on my feelings back then, I realize just how massively fucked up that detail is.  But it was true.  I was so happy to just be a simple hobo than to be at home, because it was that bad.

"Richmond, VA's Golden Corral.

Golden Corral is never what you would consider a classy place; the same people who spend their lives in walmart are the same people who eat here. However, most of these shoppers have standards. The ones that do are more likely to go to Old Country Buffet and similar establishments. The rest go to Golden Corral in Richmond.

Upon entering, I first noticed how loud it was. Mind you, it's around 9 PM. We get our drinks and go to find a table. Cotton candy was all over the floor and I nearly tripped over two unattended toddlers chasing each other. We find a seat behind two women and their kids, none of which seemed to have any table manners. Toys and food and toys *in* food littered the table; the mothers were both talking to each other, while one child decided to bathe a barbie doll in ice cream. Behind this group, a man was threatening to spray a child with a ketchup bottle. 

With a sigh, I headed to the buffet area with the rest of my family. I was headed for the pizza when I saw a young boy take his finger out of his nose in order to grab a slice with his bare hands. Seeing as how the soup section was completely ignored by these fine patrons, I decided to help myself to the mac n cheese and the chili. Satisfied, I headed back to the table (while dodging even more unattended toddlers). My mother tells us not to go to the salad bar because she saw a roach sitting in the lettuce, which had just been replaced according to her. 

I finish my first plate and go back for seconds. This time, my grandma tells me to come with her to the steak bar. 'Why not?' I thought. We're waiting in line when one of the cooks comes to where we're standing. My grandma orders and he cuts her off and says ""Would you like to buy my new mixtape? I'm an underground rapper from the Richmond area just trying to make a buck blah blah blah blah....."" Shocked, we shake our heads and he cooks our steaks without hearing what we wanted. 

We finish our meals in silence and vowed to never visit this place again."

"I wanted to kill myself and my mom.

It was very similar to the chick who wanted to kill her kid, except I was 15 and had no way of getting ahold of anything that would kill her and myself painlessly. I'm really thankful I was not able to easily get ahold of a gun because of the country I lived in. I dreamt and planned and overall obsessed endlessly about it. It was the pinnacle definition of suicidal ideation. I totally understand why suicide homicides occur. I've been dreaming of suicide cognitively since 8. You know how kids are little shits and thinks the world revolves around them? I think 15 was when that kind of self absorption for me truly stopped, and it morphed my already sick mind into caring so much for my mother that I had to take her along to. Looking back I resent my teachers for not seeing anything was wrong. I was crashing HARD, and it was obviously not drugs or an abusive boyfriend or anything like that. Just a middle class girl with once perfect attendance going AWOL out of nowhere. And all I was doing all day was dream and daydream about murder.

And then just like that, the storm passed. I can safely say I would never do that now, like it's the absolute opposite of my nature. But it showed me that we're all one mental breakdown from disaster. It showed me to be compassionate to those who seemingly do unbelievable acts. I'm glad I went through a true spell at 15, because I know the signs now on how to prevent it, where I'm an adult and can source terrible things much easier. I'm always extra diligent because we are no different from many people in society that we would like to pretend live in a different headspace. The social networks in my province are really good, and the homeless inevitably get mocked for 'not trying' or being on drugs. I think about that haze I was in and how if I couldn't kill myself, drugs would have eased a lot of it. In fact, I did become homeless for a bit, but an almost stranger saved me for a long while. When I think about how there are more unfortunate people that are not helped than not, how can I judge those who were in my shoes but could only survive from things like drug abuse or hardening oneself to surviving the winter with mental illness."

Anyways, we were kind of going through a rough patch, and she said something like ""if you really loved me, you wouldn't..."" and in that moment, something clicked. I realized she sounded just like an example in an anti-abuse brochure, and she'd say this sort of thing all the time. I realized she was a gaslighting, manipulative, abusive person, and she had been the whole year and a half we'd been together. I felt betrayed, by both her, for using me and pushing me around, and myself, for not noticing sooner or standing up for myself.

I can completely attest to this. I grew up in Newport Beach and had a really shitty old car in highschool with a broken gas gage and had to push it to a station countless times before I had the money to fix it. Every time it happened no one would stop and help but one of the time a gardener who didn't speak a lick of English stopped and helped me push it to the nearest station. When we got there I thanked kept thanking him and he acted as if he was just helping a lifelong friend.

How to Train Your Dragon
"&gt;How much effort we have to put into dating. We're expected to make the first move, plan the first date (and probably subsequent dates), go in for the kiss, hold her hand, invite her over, etc.

A while back a user on AskMen posted passages from the book ***Self-Made Man: One Woman's Year Disguised as a Man*** by Norah Vincent.  The book is about a woman who goes undercover as a man to understand what it's like.

Edit: /u/reasonbeing9 shared a video clip of her ""in the field"" on the dating scene, cued up to the relevant part:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip7kP_dd6LU&amp;t=9m8s

Credit to /u/exit_sandman for finding these passages from the book, related to dating:

&gt; An interesting passage about her realizing the feminist fallacies about what women actually want to have in men.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;    I was most surprised to find nestled inside the confines of female heterosexuality a deep love and genuine attraction for real men. Not for women in men's bodies, as the prejudicial me had thought. Not even just for the metrosexual, though he has his audience, but for brawny, hairy, smelly, stalwart, manly men; bald men, men with bellies, men who can fix things and, yes, men who like sports and pound away in the bedroom. Men whom women loved for being men and all the qualities that testosterone and the patriarchy has given them, and whom I have come to appreciate for the very same qualities, however infuriating at times I still find them.
&gt; 
&gt; Or how funny the dating experience as a man can be.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;    But for those women - who had never dated other women, and thus never been romantically hurt by them - men as a subspecies, not the particular men with whom they had been involved, were to blame for the wreck of a relationship and the psychic damage it had done to them.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   It's hardly surprising, then, that in this atmosphere, as a single man dating women, I often felt attacked, judged, on the defensive. Whereas with the men I met and befriended as Ned there was a presumption of innocence - that is, you're a good guy until you prove otherwise - with women there was quite often a presumption of guilt: you're a cad like every other guy until you prove otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;    ""Pass my test and then we'll see if you're worthy of me"" was the implicit message coming across the table at me. And this from women who had demonstrably little to offer. ""Be lighthearted,"" they said, though buoyant as lead zeppelins themselves. ""Be kind,"" they insisted in the harshest of tones. ""Don't be like others,"" they implied, while having virtually condemned me as such beforehand."

"Not a rule as such but my dad could be grumpy and give ridiculous unreasonable commands. Best example: he was in the kitchen and I walked through with a half empty glass of water that I didn't want any more. I emptied the water in the sink, put the glass in the dishwasher and started to walk away when my dad yelled at me: ""wash that drink away"". I told him it was water and he said ""I don't care, I told you to wash it away"". I did it and mumbled ""ok, I'll just wash the water away with water then"" and got a smack for giving cheek :) 

Oh and in the 80s when 'bum bags' (fanny packs) were in fashion, he wouldn't let me say bum as he thought it was rude. I had to say 'bottom bags'. So cringey!

I realize I'm saying this from a point of privilege and I know it affects him occasionally, but *for the most part* it's not a factor in our relationship. Neither of us are particularly ambitious people and don't place a lot of emphasis or importance on traditional success markers beyond making sure we have enough money to maintain our standard of living. We're hobby-driven and pleasure-driven and those are the areas we value in our relationship and define ourselves by as individuals. "

I lost about $12,000.

Also that I was depressed at the time for about a year or so because my mom was depressed and I wasn't in contact with my dad anymore (I am now! We're even closer now!), the money thing, and I almost lost my job at the time. I had nobody to talk to; all my siblings were busy with their families, my friends were moving on to other things. 

Luckily one person helped me through it all, someone I consider to be almost a lost brother to me now, someone that happened to be a stranger on the internet that I met on an anime forum. He talked to me pretty much every day, and it wouldn't just be about nerdy stuff, we would talk about everything that was happening to me in my life and his life. We would talk about pretty much everything. It helped me through the tough times so much, and I don't know if he'll ever understand how much it meant to me.

Since then one of my biggest ideals in life is communication, and I now see each random internet user as an individual person rather than just a username.

"My time to shine,

I was in the military at the time and my CO asked if some of us would like to help out a cadet organization for their summer camp. Cadets is a place where kids and teenagers can join to learn basic military skills and are usually supported by the Ministry of Defense or have some sort of relationship with the branch of the armed forces they are affiliated to. These cadets were in the 12 to 16 age bracket, male and female who had signed up to go to a military base and do some training with the regular soldiers.

I ended up looking after about 20 teenage kids for about 2 weeks; they were all nice kids but most came from very broken homes and cried out for discipline and order in their lives and to some extent most “hero” worshiped the armed forces one way or another. 

Anyway, I was firm but fair with them and gained a lot of respect and trust from them over my time as their “section nco”, especially after spending 3 days in the field with them, teaching them the basics of soldiering.  

The final week was my turn to do the night guard shift, which basically meant to look out for kids drinking booze or smoking cigarettes they have somehow smuggled onto base. Not to mention mixing teenage boys and girls together for a long period of time can get a bit crazy so you can imagine what my job at night was, it was to make sure the girls stayed in their barracks and the boys in theirs.

Anyway, 3rd night of the second week in and after I had to “confiscate” some cigarettes of a couple of younger ones smoking round the back of the drill shed (Which means, I had a smoke with them while we talked about their futures and their desire to join the Army. But in my report to the CO I punished them with PT and confiscated/destroyed their tobacco) one of the young girls approached me and asked if I could talk with her alone for a few minutes who was part of this smoking group (But did not smoke) and who were also under my command for their time on base. 

She was about 13/14 years old and I said “I would be happy to have a chat but I would need to have a member of her cadet staff with me who is female to do that” (remember these kids come from broken homes for all I know she could say something to someone about something I’ve never done and that would be me in a military prison and my career over, even accusations were enough to ruin someone’s career and we had a big briefing on it before these kids turned up on base. 


She burst into tears, I can’t deal with emotional teenage girls, so my first instinct was to get on the radio and ask for one of the cadet staff members to meet me to have the chat but this girl, but she asked me not to do that because she was afraid. Why would she be afraid of the organization she was a part of? I said I would escort her back to her barracks and if she wishes to talk to me while we are walking to her barracks she is welcome to do so. (I know there is more than one way to deal with a situation) As we were walking back she confessed to me that one of her instructors who is about 30 years old from the cadet force had given her a note and she was scared. I asked her if she had the note on her, she said yes and I said could I read this?

She said yes and gave me the note; I will never forget this note as long as I live because it gave me chills. It said “If you ever need to talk to someone alone please contact me on this number (phone number) xxx” with little hearts around it. Apparently she was telling this guy about her mum and dad and how messed up at home was and he had apparently taken this as she liked him in a romantic way from the jest of what she told me and had made a move on her. 

I knew she did not write this note herself as she had learning difficulties, she asked me to keep a secret, I tried to convince her she would be safer if she explained it to my commanding officer but she did not trust any officers as this fucker who gave her the note was an officer in the cadets.

“Fine” I said but I told her I need to tell someone in my area in order to help her. I convinced her I would take care of this and that she is safe and nothing would happen to her. She accepted what I said and then made the short walk back into her barracks for the night with my female counterpart from a different section of the armed forces. 

I then tail ended it to get the officer on duty and informed him of what was said and what happened. Witch hunt begins for this fuck head by the military police, my CO, myself and the cadet forces CO and OC.

He was thrown out of the base and handed over to the civilian police the following morning after apparently having photos of the kids on his phone and of course the note that I gave in; turns out he had prior altercations with the police when he was a sub teacher at an all-girls boarding school something to do with taking photos of underage girls and grooming them. I only know this as my mate was the MP. 

TLDR; I stopped a pedophile from grooming an underage girl for sex.

"The idea that women don't experience what it's like to be really lonely.

This is based on the notion that women never have to look for love or long for it, because dozens of amazing guys are willing to sweep them off their feet at any moment if they want. Even without that, they can dive into an ocean of quality emotional support from their female friends at any time.

For the romantic part, for maybe 10-15% of the female population that is young and very ""conventionally attractive,"" I think this might be the case -- and they get 85-90% of the male attention. Because all those guys are going for the same women, and rest of the women are sort of invisible when it comes to being considered for dates, men get the impression that women sit on the throne and just pick and choose. I think there is a similar imbalance for men, when a few who have many of important attributes get a disproportionate amount of attention.

As for friends, female friendships are complicated as fuck -- often full of hidden resentment and competition. Frequently, the friends who flock to your side in a crisis are the kind of people who just love to feed off your drama and want to feel like a hero. It's not all hugs and ice cream."
"I think by the time I was about 13 or so my self-esteem was so broken, in my head the fact that I wanted anything or even deserved anything didn't make sense.  I just demurely accepted absolutely anything my parents said.  I only started rebelling against opinions my dad held after I finished studying and started working.  Suddenly I realised I had an opinion and that opinion mattered but mostly I still shut my mouth if I went to visit him because if you didn't agree with what he said or felt or believed he blew up so badly that that I'm 12 years old and have no self-esteem thing just kicked in.  My dad was never violent, don't get me wrong here.  But I was nobody and I meant nothing and what I wanted or believed didn't matter and just tiny shitty things end up affecting a kid so badly that they still drag it around with them in their 30s and 40s."

She paid really well, and always offered me 'trinkets' like gold bracelets that I still couldn't afford 20 years later... I think in part, it was because I never mentioned what she got up too, to anyone, even my mother who was friends with her."

"Man some of you people are dense. 

My wife died several years ago. We were together for 6 years and married for 1 of those years. She committed suicide. We have a son together who is now 6.

I am in a relationship with an amazing woman who lives with my son and I. In all aspects of the word, she is his mother now. He talks about his mommy quite often. Asking questions about her or talking about things he remembers doing with her. My girlfriend knew her when she was alive and has no problem talking with him about her. 

My girlfriend decorates the house and changes the pictures often. Sometimes when she changes them, she will put up a picture of my wife. Sometimes there aren't any hung up of her at all. She understand that my wife was huge part of my life and my sons life and that we both still love and miss her and we always will. I have a big tattoo on my chest in memory of her. One of our dressers has a few stuffed animals lined up on it from our childhoods just as a keepsake/decoration kinda thing. My wife had a white tiger stuffed animal she got when she was 2. She slept with it until the day she died. My girlfriend put it on the dresser with all of the other stuffed animals.

Here's the thing. She is not my ex wife now. She was and is my family. It is wrong and ridiculous to expect someone to treat a deceased spouse as an ""ex"". You didn't decide to go different ways. A part of your family died. A piece of you was taken away. It's exactly like having a family member die. You don't just ""get over them"". You never do. That's like telling someone to stop loving their mom or throw away all of her keepsakes or take down all of her pictures because she died. 

That's the problem with most people these days. They view love as some kind of weird singular emotion. I can love my wife who has died and love my girlfriend who I am currently with. I am romantically in love with my girlfriend and I love my wife.

It would be incredibly indecent of my girlfriend to ask me to live my life as if my wife never existed. She's not an ex. She is family. She is not someone anyone needs to compete with. She is not better than you. You are not better than her. She is a part of me and always will be."

"Very early in my relationship with my then boyfriend, and now fiance, I spent the night at his apartment.  He had to leave for class before me, so I slept in in his bed.  

When I got up, I had sudden VIOLENT diarrhea.  No warning, no stomach ache or gassyness.  Just the second I stood, it started falling out. I sat down, and it stopped.  Weird.....stood back up, and it began pouring out again. I quickly sat down, and assessed the situation.  His roommate had just gotten into the shower in their 1 bathroom apartment, and he was notorious for hour long showers. 

I was wearing heavy sweat pants, but the poop wasn't going to be contained for long, and if I waited for the roommate to finish showering his bed would be wrecked.  I looked around the room, and spotted a plastic trash can, about 4 feet from the bed.  

I very delicately and quickly waddled to the trash can, dropped my pants, finished the job. I had somehow managed to only get poop in the trash can and in my pants, so I looked around for a way to get the pants off without getting poop everywhere. Ah hah! His dirty beach towel was on the desk from last weekend.  I stood on the towel, and undressed.  Thankfully, he used a liner in the trash can.  I placed my poopy pants and underwear into the trash can, cleaned up with the towel, and threw on a pair of his boxes. I quickly wrapped up the poop mess in the trash, and shamefully crept into the kitchen, praying his roommate would stay in the shower a bit longer. I grabbed two more trash bags, and darted back into his room.  I placed a new liner in the trash, and threw some wadded kleenex in there to cover my tracks. I sprayed some air freshener and opened a window. I then placed the poop towel in the second bag, and snuck out of the apartment with both bags of poop mess. 

I threw away the trash bag, and took the towel bag home.  I immediately washed the towel twice in my dorm washer, along with his boxers. 

That night, I snuck the towel back into his room in my backpack, and placed it right back where it was. 

He never found out! Until four years later, when he almost pooped his pants and was embarrassed. And I was drunk, and tried to comfort him by telling that story. He laughed, and then threw away the beach towel. "

"Saw a girl get chopped by a boat propeller from heel to her neck... So I had just turned 22 and I was living in Austin at the time. Me and my friends decided to go out on Lake Travis for my birthday weekend so naturally we went to the strop club a few days before to get some dancers and cocktail waitresses to come with. So Saturday comes and we're having a good time out on the Lake drinking (not the driver he stayed sober the whole day) and one of the girls has had a little too much to drink and she realizes she lost her phone. She starts to freak the fuck out over this saying that we need to take her back to the bar we had lunch at or she was gonna jump off the boat. We told her don't worry about it we'll go back, we'll find the phone and if we don't  we'll all chip in and help her get a new one. Well she's not getting it and she starts trying to jump off the boat. We are able to restrain her and think we're in the clear. 5 minutes later she just jumps off the front of the boat and takes one of the guys on the boat with her. Me and my best bud from high school (Nathan) knew it was gonna be bad, and then we saw the water change color behind us to red. 

We both sobered up quick as hell, he jumped in swam out to her, I threw out the life ring to pull them to us as fast as possible and then pulled her into the boat. Mind you there is about 14 people total on this boat and only 3 acted fast, the third was our driver who like I said was stone sober the whole day. The girls were all freaking the fuck out because when I pulled her into the boat you could see everything, chunks of flesh that was eaten up by the propeller exposed bone on her back, the makings went from her heel to her neck. The guy that she took over the front of the boat with her miraculously was untouched. 

The absolute worst part of it for me was that I knew we needed to apply pressure to these massive wounds. So as we made our way to the nearest place for paramedics to reach us I sat on the back of the boat and kept solid pressure applied on her back. Now what made this so hard was her screaming, I still remember her begging me to let her go that I was hurting her, but I knew we had to slow the bleeding. I honestly don't know how long I had to hold her back together but it seemed to be forever. I was able to keep pressure applied the whole time. I honestly thought that she wouldn't make it, I am happy to tell you she is alive and well. When we visited her in the hospital the doctors said that if it was not for either one of the three of us that were able to keep cool heads under pressure she would have not made it. 

...So yeah no worse birthday party than that day! Haven't been on a boat since. "

First time was when some local kids (about 6 of them) were jumping on my car outside and kicking the windscreen in. Found out they were social services placed and real trouble makers but kept moving to a new family every 3 months, so they were really fucked up. Felt sorry for them as well but wasn't going to confront them. 

Second time was when my heart starting racing and couldn't catch my breath. Managed to phone and paramedics needed to kick the door in with the police and found me in the corner unable to walk or breathe. Found out that ESG was fine and I was having a severe anxiety attack (wasn't worrying about anything at the time I recall) but as I thought I was having a heart attack I was stuck in a vicious cycle that I couldn't  break from. Scariest time of my life and thought I was going to drop dead there and then. "

"Went to school with Brandon Stanton, the humans of new york guy. He absolutely loved being popular. Everything he did was essentially to get and maintain attention. Fairly smart, somewhat funny, a reasonably functioning druggie, and always really fucking loud. After high school, he bounced around for a while. Always talked about writing a book or producing a documentary or something. Essentially, they were all just different plans for projects that would make him famous.

Anyway, he eventually moved to NY and started taking pictures of people, and it took off. It's a great site, and he probably does more good than most. But it never would have happened if he didn't love attention and praise."

"There were a few good reasons. A big one was that I let him walk all over me a bit too much which is very unlike me/my personality in other relationships and in life in general. Sometimes I wonder if this dynamic was actually a result of him initially being my ""superior"". However, I do have a pretty strong/outgoing personality and can be very turned on by being put in my place when I'm attracted to someone. 

Anyway, he broke up with me I think because he wasn't feeling challenged anymore. I was devastated but got over it pretty much entirely in 2-3 months. We started talking again as friends and I think that when he saw that I was totally over him and kinda got my sassiness back, realised he made a mistake.

I am fairly certain that if I wanted to get back together with him now, he would be down. "

"As someone who spent the better part of a decade as a journalist in Africa lemme tell you that doc is shit. I can get into all the reasons why if you want but a few of the main reasons are: 

1. It makes a big deal creating danger out of normal situations that aren't dangerous. In one instance they are filming on a rooftop in a slum and a crowd forms. That's...not weird or dangerous. And really common in any part of Africa. I've had crowds form every single time I've taken out my camera and recorder. It's never once proved dangerous in a normal city. In conflict zones sure, but that wasn't a conflict zone. 
2. It glorified white fixers when real journalists here never use white fixers. WHY WOULD WE? We use Africans who know the language, culture, have inroads with local police and military and can blend in easily in dangerous situations. But oh here's his white guy who got malaria like 5 times. Protip: if you've gotten malaria 5 times living in Africa you're a moron. I never got it once. Most of my friends got it maybe once or twice. 5 times? Reckless and moronic. 
3. Most of what warlords 'do' is hyped. Yes atrocities and child soldiers are real. But the 'magic' they have from their rituals is often lied about to create a sense of fear around everybody. They are typical tyrants who want control - and use lore to get it. They are also very human and hardly mythical. But instead of showing them in a real light, they propagated the dangerous ritualistic rumors those same warlords peddle in. 
4. It did a poor job explaining the conflict and the factors that played into it and the way governments are working to keep it from happening again. 

Anyway - there's some excellent docs on African wars out there. Al Jazeera's Orphans of the Desert is phenomenal. But here's the real secret: Serious journalists who work for AFP, Jazeera, BBC and so forth avoid VICE. They pay journalist shit, leech off of freelancers, take months to pay them without providing any safety net, and create sensationalist documentaries that rarely cover things accurately. 

Do yourself a favor and look up some of the better docs from AJ and BBC. Happy to recommend a few if you like. 

**Edit:**
**As requested here are some great docs on Africa to watch:**

States of Independence - The Scramble for Africa: Because it's important to realize so many of these countries are younger than your mom. 

Congo: White King, Red Rubber, Black Death: Belgian government called it bullshit but BBC was like 'go fuck yourself'. Super good. Especially for those that don't realize how prolific the Belgian genocide in the Congo was. 

War Dance: Gorgeous and terribly sad. About Uganda's war-torn north. About Kony but not that bullshit Kony 2012 fuckery. 

Virunga: Doesn't tell the whole story but a good primer for actually learning more about the subject. It also shows how deeply many of these wildlife national parks folks care about their job. I've met and worked with these types for years and most are absolutely heroes. 

Stealing Africa: I don't super love the style of this one - it's a bit flashy - but it's factual

God Loves Uganda: Because seriously ya'll need to understand the impact of missionaries and how much they have fucked up these countries. 

An African Journey with Jonathan Dimbleby: Because so much of Africa is great and people never hear the great shit. 

The Supreme Price: Watch as a  young Nigerian woman tries to help her country become a proper democracy. 

Orphans of the Sahara: it's gorgeously filmed and tells the heartbreaking story of displacement by those exploited by conflict. It's excellent work from Al Jazeera. 

I'd also like to point out there's a number of excellent Frontline docs and People and Power docs on Africa that are more short form - but most are made by great professionals who I admire. So scroll through those if you're interested or need to build some knowledge from the ground up. Frontline is exceptional at this - building knowledge from a base of zero for those who have never been or have no understanding of the region. I love those guys. 

Happy watching!

"I only drove a couple of months with Uber. I picked up a woman who just left a gala. She looked visibly shaken so I asked if everything was ok?  

Turns out she caught her husband making out with a woman outside of the bathroom. She then broke down into tears.   

I eventually calmed her down by telling her of my ex-wife's infidelity that eventually led to our divorce. She asked if I was happier and I said ""of course. I get to help awesome passengers like you.""

I drop her off at her destination and forget about the whole thing until a couple of months later when I get an email from Uber. Apparently the woman had reached out repeatedly to them asking for my email address because she wanted to thank me personally. They declined to hand it out but told her they would forward me her email address.  

I sat on it a couple of days but eventually sent her an email.

His son is standing right there when I had this conversation with the GM and heard every word. I am freaking out trying to get out of there while on the phone with my friends who were with my puppy and this little shit had the gall to say to me in front of his dad and other employees ""as soon as you are done get your ass back to work"" all because he wanted to leave early and go party.

"It helped me and my eventual wife when I defined the problem in very clear terms to her. 

""I really love spending time with you, but I am an introvert and I need to recharge sometimes. I can only really do that by being alone for an evening. In fact, I've been over exerting myself because I'm so into you, but it's really starting to wear me down. I need you to understand that if I need a day where we don't hang out once in a while, it's really not about you; it's about me needing to recharge.""

Then proceed to show her your preferred introverts vs extroverts cartoon. If she can't get it when you lay it out as your needs not only in this relationship but in all relationships in general, then she's not worth keeping around.

This is assuming you're an introvert of course. But flavor to taste either way. The point is don't frame it like you're trying to just get away for one fucking day what's the big deal. Frame it as it's a need you have in any relationship, and one that's not currently being met, and it's been stressing you out. 

Don't use blame or absolutes (you always blah blah, you never blah), just be honest and use ""I feel"" statements. I feel exhausted and overwhelmed needing to be together every day. I feel guilty for feeling that way because I really do value our time together. I feel confident that we can find a compromise that lets us both get what we need out of this. "

One day she was heating oil in a pan to make I don't remember what. She turned the burner on high but didn't want to stand near it while the oil got hot enough to cook in. So she walked away to the bedroom where the computer was and started browsing the internet.

I was in the living room and I see dancing light coming from the kitchen. I realize what it is, yell out ""fire!"", and rush into the kitchen. The oil auto ignited. I grabbed the fire extinguisher from under the sink. Then I grabbed the lid to the pan and used it to snuff out the fire. It worked.

Learn basic fire fighting knowledge. Tossing water on it or trying to move the pan at all would have been bad.

Nowadays I keep a big fire extinguisher in the garage (which is also my workshop), and smaller ones in the house including a class K in the kitchen.

"a cup of coffee.



i went on this date. it was bombing fast. he seemed totally uninterested and i was used to being shut down, so i just chalked it up as a loss. 

since he was newer to town, i asked if he wanted to go with me to my fave coffee shop after our date, my treat. [he had said he loved coffee.] he said sure. thinking i could at least salvage a friendship. 


that coffee turned into a walk. the walk turned into dinner. dinner turned into going to my place for a movie. that turned into a sleepover. which turned into a 17 mile hike the next day. 



and the rest is history. we have years behind us. kids. a family. and it all started because i bought him a cup of coffee. "

" I worked in a video store at a strip mall that had a publically accessible underground parking lot.  In the winter when it was really cold as hell outside it was a great place to park.  One time when my shift was over I went downstairs and as soon as I opened the door I was greeted by a giant wall of smoke that went from floor to ceiling.  Immediately I went ""Fuck this!"" and slammed the steel door shut.  Then I pulled the fire alarm.  

What I didn't know was there was a dumpster in there made for food waste the served the restaurants in the mall.  Someone from the bar (probably the busboy) tossed a whole can of cigarette ash into the dumpster and it caught fire.  It was mostly all wet food waste, so it smoldered and filled the whole parking lot with smoke so thick you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.  But no one knew this until later, after the fire department arrived and blew the smoke out of the garage.  

I had just pulled the fire alarm, then I went back upstairs and figured I should inform people there was a fire in the parking lot downstairs.  That was the dumb mistake.  

EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HEARD ME IMMEDIATELY RAN INTO THAT FIRE TO SAVE THIER CAR.  

Every *single* one.  

They all saw the same thing I did as soon as they opened that door to the garage.  A giant wall of smoke and without hesitation they ran right into it like a lemming off a cliff.   They had no idea was it a serious fire?  Would they have enough air to breathe?  Would they even be able to find their car?  Even if they found their car would they be able to drive it out?  They just wandered around lost until the fire department showed up and cleared out the smoke.  

Next time something like that happens I'm keeping my damn mouth shut and let the fire department deal with it so I'm not responsible for killing an entire room full of idiots.

"I didn't believe in ""bad feelings"" for most of my life, usually I would just ignore my own and nothing would come of it. My wife however gets freakishly accurate bad feelings. Like I said though, I didn't believe in them so the first few times she said she had a bad feeling I ignored it and ended up in serious trouble for it.  
  
The most recent being that we were on a hiking trip with a group of friends to a waterfall in a valley, and halfway down she gets the feeling we should turn back. At this point I still didn't believe in these feelings so I encouraged everyone to keep going. About five minutes after getting to the waterfall a storm blows up out of nowhere and the valley starts to flood, we had to crawl out through muddy flood waters and came disturbingly close to drowning. Ever since then if she mentions a bad feeling I do what she says, that was the last time I ignored her advice."
"I had a pet duck when I was a kid. I was 2 years old, and there was a  pet shop that had one on display. My mother wanted me to have a dog, but we lived in an apartment, and she never liked cats. She took me to the pet shop to get a fish, and I went crazy about the duck, so she bought it (I don't remember any of that, she told me). We named him Facundo, until she laid an egg, so Facunda. Apparently the cold from the apartment floor wasn't good for her, and she got arthritis in her right leg. We used to put her leg in warm water several times a day, until she got better, but she always had a slight limp in that leg. A few years later we moved back to the countryside, so we also got two dogs, and afterwards two rabbits. I ate more duck eggs than chicken eggs in my childhood, delicious. When she was around 5 or 6 years old, she started nesting all the fucking time, and taking care of her eggs. We couldn't find a male duck for her, but a guy from a nearby farm that raised ducks gave us a dozen eggs, said they were a mix, but at least one or two should hatch. So we changed her unfertilized eggs for this ones (bitch wouldn't let us even get close to them) ... and FUCKING NINE HATCHED, and 8 lived. She walked around the yard all day, proud as fuck, with her babies following her. She was more dog than duck though, she came when you called her, she played, she didn't mind being held, and she was badass: our German Shepherd Toby was genuinely scared of her. We also had a family of phymy chickens. The day she died (purely of old age), goddamn, was the saddest thing I had ever seen: She had been feeling bad for a few days already, so we kept her inside most of the day (it was winter). That afternoon we could tell she didn't have much strength left in her, and we wanted her to be with her babies (who were all adults already), so we let them all into the kitchen, where she was. After she passed, I was crying,my sister was crying, my mother was crying, and her babies went around her poking her to see if she would move, then they did what we called ""duck cake"", were they all pile up together to stay warm. It was legit the sweetest thing I've seen on 32 years on this planet. So, I was raised with 2 dogs, 9 ducks, pygmy 3 chickens, three regular chickens, and two rabbits, I couldn't be happier. I don't have any picks with me right now though, they're all at my mother's house and not digitized. I should get around to that one of this days. "

"I went into engineering school in my late 20s.  I only picked it for the paycheck at the end and told people that when they asked.  Senior year, two months from graduating I had a TF (who was maybe 18/19) tell me about how I was going to be miserible because engineering wasn't my passion and I needed to quit.

The advice given to highschool/college students is to follow their dreams, make sure they're passionate about their job.  I think it's hard for them to wrap their head around a job being just a job.  Better advice would be, ""What's something you're decently good at and NEEDS to be done, that you wouldn't mind doing a few hours each day?"" Instead of, ""What's you passion?!"" My passion at 17 was reading books and watching anime.

Anyways, I enjoy engineering, I'm good at it.  But what I really like is that paycheck that allows me to work part time if I choose and go kayaking the rest of the day.  That's pretty nice.  "

"The are infinite solutions for this, but there are at least two plausible ones: first, he should said *three*, because that's the amount of letters in each number. The second possible solution is to sum the individual ~~guarisms~~ numerals in each number and doubling the result if it is one digit, or doing the algorithm again otherwise; 12 is 1 + 2, the sum is 3, that gives you 6. 6, in the other hand, is 0 + 6. Double it, it gives you 12. 1 + 2 = 3, double it up, bam, 6. So, the answer on this case would be 2.

Edit: wow, such upvotes, many happiness! My English is still unpolished, so by *guarism* I meant numeral or digit. I choose numeral because it is more elegant than digit, which, if I'm right —and I highly doubt it— is tied to the base-10 system.

"I hate chaos in the classroom because it's inevitable for me. But I teach ESL in China to kids so that's a very different situation. We have also the parents monitoring the classes through one-way mirrors in the halls connected to the classrooms as well as through TV cameras. I've been interrupted during class by my classroom assistants because the parents don't think I'm making their kids happy enough as I'm trying to discipline their heinously noisy and disrespectful brood. 

I regularly get punched, slapped, kicked, what have you by the kids. Apparently this is common for ESL in China. Then again as far as the company I work for is concerned I'm more of a marketing tool. 

Don't get me wrong, sometimes it can be rewarding and fun. I have some great kids and they're a joy to teach. But when it's a very real possibility that I'll get kicked in the nuts if I appropriately discipline the wrong kid, sorta colors the experience. 

Edit: Generally the punching and slapping isn't hard, and they're kids so it doesnt hurt(it's usually playful), but whatever.
Update: These are obviously more extreme examples but the kids are often hectic little bastards.  In regard to the parents, sometimes they're great and want me to discipline the kids in a deserving fashion but it's pretty inconsistent. And only one kid deliberately kicked in me in the nards. "

"Drove Uber. 
I picked up a woman. Pretty attractive Latina. Thick in all the right ways. I see that the trip is going to take a little over an hour. You get good at reading people and gauging their willingness for small talk when you've been driving for a while. You also have a pretty good stock of questions and conversation starters based on the length of the trip. If it's going to be 5-10 minutes: ""how's your day? Lovely/shitty weather out today, huh? Etc..."" &gt;30 minutes: ""So what do you do for a living? Are you still in school? What did/do you study?"" Because this was going to be a significantly longer ride, we end up talking about our respective significant others. After about 30 minutes of driving, we became fairly comfortable together which is why when her phone rang, and she informed me that it was her boyfriend and to excuse her for a second while she took the call, I offered a friendly hello that was loud enough for him to hear on the other end of the phone... This was a mistake. After offering my greeting, there was a pregnant pause followed by an audible  ""Who the fuck was that?"" From the phone. A huge fight ensued. ""Why the fuck do you not trust me at all? You're the one that cheated on me!"" ""[unintelligible response]"" ""I'm taking an expense as fuck Uber to get home just to see you and take care of your unemployed ass."" The fight continued on in this matter for about 5 minutes before she all but threw her phone out the window in anger. After hanging up, she looked at me through my rear view mirror and deadpan asked ""you wanna pull over and fuck me?"" I was not expecting this. One of the main things we had talked about was how happy we had been with our respective significant others. I was extremely happy with my then girlfriend who is now my fiancé, so I declined as delicately as possible. She didn't even seem upset by the fact. That didn't prevent her however from leaving her purse in my back seat so as to call me back ten minutes later and requisition me again. Crazy fucking broad, probably would have been a spectacular lay. I hope things are working out for her. "

For those not familiar, the program combines some of the best manipulation tools in an accidental way to leave the participants worse off. The self-reported ""helpful"" rate was good, until you look at the empirical statistics, which show it was rather harmful compared to a control.

The best way to get at-risk youth not to commit crime is to treat them as if they won't, get them involved in positive time-spenders (sports, volunteering, etc), and surround them with not-at-risk peers. Talking to them as if your assuming they will do bad things and having them spend time with each other exacerbates the problems."

As I pull out the next card the door flies open and in walks the kinda dame that makes your heart skip a beat - arrhythmia of the worst kind. She lunges forward fast as the last card leaves my fingers - it was destined to be a hit. With the swiftness of a cat in heat she nabs the card from the air. My jaw hangs open in disbelief as I look closely and see my queen of hearts."

"A very similar thing happened to my parents in VA! They bought a home that was this awful faded grey that really needed to be repainted. My mom thought a nice light, grey blue would be a refreshing choice because everything else in the neighborhood was either that same shade of grey or red brick. The house was also colonial revival if I'm remembering correctly, and that's not exactly an unusual color to paint them.

The HOA rejected the color, point blank said only some ""crass Texan"" would want to paint their house blue, and told her to come back with an appropriate color choice. They also reminded her that the bylaws specifically stated ""any historically accurate color"" was acceptable, so she could start there if she was short on ideas or taste.

Well, my mother was a retired lawyer, and the most vindictive human being I've ever met. She enlisted the help of a historian who worked with my dad, who gladly offered his time for free when he heard he was helping win a war against a HOA, to pin down heaps of evidence that an Even Brighter Shade of blue was not only historically accurate for that style of house, but had even been the original color of several houses in the neighborhood. They found shade mixing instructions and everything. 

The HOA tried to throw a fit about this new development, but apparently one member had some common sense and talked the others down when my mom hinted that she also had evidence that this awful grey-puple shade was also historically accurate. 

The final blue color was very nice. It wasn't an eyesore/spite house situation, and the shade would have weathered beautifully. But my dad got transferred and they sold it, and apparently not even 3 years later the house was back to being grey."

I went in 2nd and was told that we were being terminated for violating a company policy against dating coworkers.  Admittedly, I didn't read the policies because it was ""just"" a shitty, $11/hour warehouse job.  Anyway, I told them that we legitimately had no idea it was against policy, but that it was me who pursued her.  I explained that she was reluctant at first, but relented in the end.  I apologized to the HR folks and volunteered to resign on my own as long as they allowed her to keep her position.  That request was granted and I parted ways with that company.  She and I ended things between us and as far as I know, she is back together with her ex-boyfriend.  Anyway, sex was really good."

"Every troop leader I've ever met at Boy Scout Camp. If you were troop lead, you were little more than a representative for your troop at the leader meeting each night. You didn't decide anything or make choices for your troop. All you did was bring your updated roster, any equipment or service requests, and relayed back any news or information to your respective troop. A troop leader was essentially just a manilla envelop that asked questions. But this very clear lack of power never stopped a single scout that held that title from believing they were only a few drops of blood short of scouting royalty. 

One year, the troop leader at my site (we shared a camp site with another troop) held random ""Tent inspections"". If your tent wasn't organized the way he felt was appropriate and correct, he'd give you a demerit. What a demerit actually meant was not explained. What he felt was appropriate and correct was also not explained. It was summer, and hot, so most of us just rolled the side flaps up so that the tents were essentially just A-frame tarps hanging about 3 feet off the ground. Each flap that was rolled up was a separate demerit. If your sleeping bag wasn't rolled up or in it's stuff sack, it was a demerit. If you hung a lamp or lantern from the frame, it had to be taken down during the day. None of these things were actual rules. That same year, he attempted to rigidly enforce a swimming policy that the scouts from our campsite couldn't go swimming unless they got his approval. More demerits were earned there too. 

A year or two later, a kid from my own troop was troop leader. The little bitch would play Reveille 5 minutes before the rest of the camp did. No demerits that year, but he did threaten to tell the adult leader if we didn't wake up on time. The adults regularly slept right up until breakfast, so they didn't care. That year, the camp store started stocking backpacking hammocks....which we naturally all bought and then had to re-hang multiple times because the troop leader would dismantle them during merit badge classes. He also kept trying to get us in trouble for bringing juice back from the cafeteria after lunch.

"Okay, look... once in a while, cat noises are fine. Hell, there are even some occasions when they might be considered sexy. The problem arises when a young woman decides that ""Meow meow meow meow meow!"" is an acceptable surrogate for actual speech.

Several years ago, for example, I was casually dating a girl who thought it was cute to crawl onto my bed, pretend to knead at the covers, and then huskily whisper ""Meow! Meow *meow* meow meow meow!"" at me. The first several times that it happened, I thought she was trying to initiate some kind of animal-based roleplay... and while I admittedly *did* end up chasing her around my apartment (while barking) once, she was usually just trying to start a conversation:

------

""Meow meow meow! Meow meow meow meow!""

""What was that? Did you say something?""

""Meow *meow* meow meow meow meow!""

""Are you... are you asking me to pet your pussy?""

""Meeeeooooooow...""

""Look, I apologize if I'm missing something or ruining whatever playful atmosphere you're trying to foster, but I'd prefer that you talk to me in English if you have something to say.""

""... Meow?""

""I'm going to go get the spray bottle.""

""*Hiss!*""

------

In short, I can put up with *some* cat noises, provided that they're offered at an appropriate time, and not at the expense of more meaningful interactions. As soon as they become a primary method of communication, though... well, as I said: Please stop making cat noises."

"I lived with a Polish guy once that drank constantly. I don't just mean every other night or even every night, I mean he spent every waking hour drinking alcohol. 

I would go into the living room for breakfast at 9am and he'd be cracking open a can of beer. When I got home from work at 6 or 7 he'd be drinking a can of beer. He'd sometimes come home drunk at 2 or 3 am. He worked in a restaurant and the owner would actually let him have wine on his breaks like other people have soda or smokes. 

Bear in mind this was a tourist resort in the mediterranean so drinking was more commonplace and accepted, but it was the fact that he simply never sobered up that amazed me. 

It began to affect his health in the end, he was having constant headaches, presumably from dehydration, and he ended up going home to Poland, presumably to sober up though I wouldn't count on it."

Amy - a documentary about Amy Winehouse. Her life, her music and of course her death. Really amazing documentary with a lot of raw footage. (The same people also made Senna which I'd also really recommend)

The Jinx - A great true crime documentary about the life and deaths of Robert Durst. It has a slow start, but it just keeps getting better and better.

Jiro: Dreams of Sushi - a documentary about (one of) the most famous sushi maker(s) in the world and his passion for his work. I don't really like sushi, but this documentary was really awesome.

Happy People: A Year In The Taiga - a documentary about the life and work of trappers (animal hunter sort of) in a small town in the Siberian taiga. Sounds boring, but such an interesting documentary.

Prophet's Prey - about a guy who owns a cult that's basically known for polygamous and underage marriage. Quite a shocking one, especially because it's a lesser known cult and it's still active.

Louis Theroux and the Brothel - Louis (all his work is truly amazing, but I had to pick one) visits a brothel in Nevada and stays there for a couple of weeks and meets several people in the brothel.


The Woman Who Wasn't There - about a woman who claims she's a 9/11 survivor and does all these tours around the Twin Tower memorial place, even though she wasn't actually there.

The Red Pill - a feminist filmmaker explores the mysterious ""Men's Rights Movement"" and starts questioning her own beliefs.

The list could go on especially because I've probably forgot a few of my favorites, but these ones are on the top of my head and are really interesting (no particular order)."

This is a throwaway because I dont want any of this to come back to me, as I have changed my life.

I was a member of the Provisional IRA in the 80s and 90s and fought in the ""Troubles."" 

For background on the conflict: from roughly 1966- 1998, Northern Ireland suffered from intense sectarian conflict. Poor/working class Irish Catholics all over the region protested for equal rights, while a large fringe of nationalist committed violence and terrorism, hoping that it would scare the British government into letting Northern Ireland into reunite with the rest of Ireland. Meanwhile, the majority, more middle class Protestant population (primarily of Scottish descent) used violence and intimidation (and their control of government and police) to try and prevent reunification, and in A LOT (and I mean a lot) of cases, keep Catholics ""in their place."" Meanwhile, the British Army was sent in to maintain order, and was supposed to be impartial, but because many mostly Protestant British soldiers often showed favoritism towards the Protestant population, and often used violence towards peaceful protesting Catholics and often used excessive force to weed out radicals, they soon became hated by most Catholics which led to violence being committed against them too.

Well, the biggest Irish nationalist militia was by far the Provisional Irish Republican Army. At its peak in the 70s/80s, there were several thousand members, including me. We used shootings, kidnappings, but mostly bombings in those hopes of killing so many British soldiers the British government relent and let us join the Irish Republic.

Well, now to my story. I was born in a poor family in Derry in northwest Northern Ireland. Derry is kind of the hotbed of Irish nationalism, since it is a poor, mostly Catholic town. Well, growing up, my entire family was treated very poorly by the ruling Protestant class. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was our version of police, but they were almost exclusively Protestant and openly sectarian. They would harass Catholics, call us ""Taigs"" (thats basically the Irish equivalent of nigger) and such. My father worked in the Protestant side of town and was constantly harassed and threatened, and after he was beaten by a group of men with tire irons when I was 10, he stopped working in the Protestant part of town and became unemployed.

When I was 12, the Bloody Sunday massacre happened. 14 unarmed Catholic protesters, protesting against the internment (imprisonment) of Catholics without trial, just because they were suspected of terrorist ties, were shot dead. Later that year, my older cousin, Bernard, newly wed, along with 4 others was shot dead in a bar when Protestant terrorist stormed in and started shooting. 

In 1978, my best friend Danny was beaten by a Protestant mob. He was installing a refrigerator in a wealthy area of town and on his way out he was attacked by a Protestant mob and was beat so bad he was paralyzed from the waist down.

When I was 16 me and my friends were standing by a nationalist mural and several RUC ""officers"" arrested us for criminal activity and roughed us up before letting us go.

This radicalized me. I began to hate Protestants. Ruining my fathers business, killing my cousin, paralyzing my best friend, harassing me. 

So in 1979, I became involved with the IRA. I wasnt an official member, but I helped them get supplies, hid and transported weapons, warned them of troop movements, etc.

I really joined in 1981. That year, 10 IRA and INLA (another Irish nationalist group) prisoners died in prison on hunger strike, protesting their awful treatment (routine beatings, poor sanitation, etc.) in prison. This made me furious. I really became involved then. I became a major arms dealer for the IRA. I'd go to Libya, America, South America, anywhere to get weapons and supplies. Rifles, pistols, grenades, machine guns, even rocket launchers. 

Qaddafi and the Libyans were big fans. Around 1985 in just 4-5 shipments they gave us enough weapons to arm a whole battalion. The Yanks were also big fans. Id go to Boston, talk to some community leaders, and every night Id go to bars around town asking for money for ""the cause"" and it just pored in. Colombian drug dealers/ militants and Palestinians would give us guns in return for training. 

I got arrested a few times and spent a few years in prison, but since I spent most of my time overseas, often in 3rd world countries, I didnt have to worry much (I did get arrested in NYC once in 1994 for that, but they dropped the charges).

Without going into details, because again, I want to keep my privacy, my life changed when my younger brother was killed by an IRA bomb. He was a Catholic. Now, Catholics did occasionally become collateral damage when the IRA bombed places, but having my own brother, who was innocent and involved in no militant activity whatsoever, die... it really changed me. Seeing my nephew cry over his dead father made me realize that it was all pointless. For 15 odd years I'd been in the IRA, and despite all the violence, nothing changed, and now my brother was dead.

The IRA is not like the mafia, as long as you stay silent, you can leave the organization when you want. I simply told my commanders in light of what happened I was done with the struggle.

In 1998, the Good Friday Agreement was passed. That pretty much ended the conflict. But in those 30 years of conflict, 3,500 people, soldiers, militants, civilians, police, of all religions, age groups, genders, had died, with more than 50,000 wounded.

I no longer live in Northern Ireland, but I still visit regularly. Northern Ireland is not perfect. Sectarian violence is still relatively common, every once and a while, a killing will rock the country. But overall, progress is there. The police, although still majority Protestant, now have a lot of Catholics and are much fairer. The Brits have stopped the covert cooperation with loyalist militants and now enforce anti terrorism on all sides relatively fairly (there is still some bias though). And best of all, the militant groups are almost all gone. The IRA, which had around 10,000 members at its peak, how has, last I heard, less than 200. Most loyalist militias, which became more like street gangs the past couple years, are gone. 

Things arent perfect, but there better. I however look back on my time in the IRA with regret. I only wonder what damage was done with the weapons I funneled. For all I know something I funneled may have killed my own brother. I can only hope God will forgive me. I have tried to make up for what I have doing volunteer work, campaigning against violence, occasionally sharing my story. 

Violence changes nothing. I and the rest of Northern Ireland learned this lesson the hard way. One peace treaty changed more in Northern Ireland than 3 decades of violence. For those who feel inclined towards violence too achieve their goals, remember this.

Daily I wake up at 4am get ready and usually get in a 8-10 hour day, on weekends I usually still put in half days. I generally make between $20-30/hour depending on project. Extremely satisfied with this, I have minimal bills and usually make enough on 1 week to pay a months worth.

"I'm from the opposite side of this. I'm a guy that got a ""mail ordered bride."" We went through an agency. Excluding gifts, airline tickets, etc, it cost me about $23,000. We've been married for 4 years. 

I could not be more average. I'm a 5'10"", 29 year old, 160lb, white American. I live in California; I have a bachelors and masters degree from the UC system. I am a Sr. software engineer for Netflix. 

I am extremely socially awkward - to the point where it is completely debilitating. I have maybe two friends I see about once a week, and that's about it. I rarely go out. Even doing something like getting my haircut, going to a bar, or going to a company event completely drains me. I blame it on my fucked up childhood and abusive parents, but that's another story. 

I've been lonely my entire life. All I've ever really wanted was a sweet girl to share my life with and share affection with. But I realized I couldn't really get that with me being so fucked up mentally. 

To be honest, I started fucking a lot of prostitutes at age 22. I had just finished my masters and started working, so I finally had money to spend. I mean, I started my job in the six figures, and now my salary begins with a 3, so I had a lot of money to spend. It's about $100-$150 to fly from SF to San Diego, and a short drive from there to Tijuana. I'd do that multiple times per month, and hit up the Caribbean / Colombia / Costa Rica / Panama / DR / etc a lot too. I was sexually fulfilled, but still lonely. I then decided to think more about an arranged marriage.

I went through an agency, which is how I met my current wife. I flew out to the Philippines multiple times to meet her. She was very bubbly and sweet, which overwhelmed me. I fell for her pretty quick. 

Importantly, she was very American. She was completely fluent in English, and went to college at NYU on a scholarship. She couldn't find a job in the US, so she had to go back home to the Philippines. Her family was very poor and lived in one of the poor provinces, and they spent everything they had trying to get her a better education so she wouldn't have to live like that (although she mostly went to school on a scholarship. Their entire life savings was less than three thousand dollars.) After moving back to the Phillipines, she worked in the tourism industry during the day and at a call center at night.

More than anything, she wanted to move back to America. She hated dealing with rude tourists and callers for 14 hours a day to make the equivalent of about $20 or $25. Which is why she decided to get an arranged marriage - she didn't see any other way out of her situation.

My company let me take a 3 month sabbatical, and during that three months I moved to the phillipines. It was during this time she completely won me over and I decided to marry her. She was just so affectionate - always wanting to hold my hand, burying her face into my chest, hugging me constantly - I loved it. We'd talk for (literally) hours, and she's the only person I can say I've ever done that with. And I loved her personality - she's a very silly girl that can always make me laugh, she's completely loyal, and has an incredible confidence that I wish I could share. 

We got married and she moved to the US with me. Because she'd lived in the US for 4 years already, it wasn't a huge transition for her. She made friends quickly, and started working as a scuba and diving guide. I pay for everything on my salary, and she sends her entire salary to her family in the phillipines. I've never been happier in my life. Right now, she's four months pregnant with our first. 

Sometimes I'm self conscious about whether or not I'd taken advantage of her situation, or if she actually loves me, or if I'm just convenient, but I trust her. She's happy. I'm happy. We're happy. I love her dearly, and I'm excited to start a family with her. At this point, our origin story doesn't really matter. "

"My school actually punished students for missing homework, even if they showed what was left of it. This is because ONE kid used some trick he saw in a comic where he used a recipe where the end result looked like slobber covered shreds of paper. From what I remember, it involved paper and some clear glue. He was caught when a teacher went to investigate and saw the comic facing the window with a mixing bowl, glue and some other stuff. Now if someone's pet really does rip up their work they spend all of lunchtime in detention without even being allowed to eat."

"My mom had a litany of 'medical issues' that prevented her from doing anything. Many unsubstantiated and seemingly only when  convenient but pointing that out led to a hell that wasn't worth it. But she also had to have everything  perfect and done exactly as she would have, which changed all the time. 

One time I cleaned the garage as per her instructions, and when I was done she suddenly realized she wanted it organized a completely different way so I had to take everything out and do it again. And then she realized she liked it better before, so I had to do it a third time. All while getting berated over how much of an idiot I was and how poorly I did things etc etc. 

Having to do things over and over was commonplace and daily, from small things like sweeping or mowing to big projects involving carpentry. In hindsight I should not have tolerated it but I really didn't question it or think I had a choice until I was long out of it.     "

The sequel catches up with their lives years later; they're now middle aged like the original Trainspotting viewers and have middle aged problems. Still, they're junkies at heart and the friendships are true.    
    
I feel that way a lot. I'm middle aged but when I'm around my friends from waaay back, it's like the chaos comes to life immediately. But you can never live it as an actual lifestyle again, though it's fun to re-visit sometimes and be nostalgic. It's part of youth. The movie acknowledges this and even makes fun of itself indirectly."
Me and my mom saw someone or something watching us sleep. I was about 5 or 6 years old and my mom was putting me to sleep. I fell asleep and when I woke up in the middle of the night I saw a dark figure like a man standing in front of the window. I woke my mom up almost about to cry and I was hoping it was just a tree or something because we were on the second floor of the house. But when she woke up she also saw what happened and told me to stay put and don't move. She quickly ran to the living room because we had guests over and everyone was still up drinking. She told everyone what happened and for 3 hours everyone went out and searched around the house. What I didn't tell her was that when she left the window started to rattle as if someone was trying to open it. I was scared and never slept on my own in that room until I was 8.

"Probably the worst thing was calling a town meeting (in the church, it was the biggest building in the town), barring the door and burning it down.

The thing that I am most proud of is more complicated. We were playing a Hackmaster 4th edition game. It was an evil campaign with a few evil leaning neutrals (my sidekick was a human druid). I was playing a half-orc assassin. Despite not being a cleric I always played the character as a very devout worshiper of Gruumish. We come upon an ancient orc temple to Grummish and I decided that it would not do to have the place in disrepair so my character went about cleaning up and doing repairs. I also turned out we had found an important orcish artifact a few adventures back which was ""activated"" by being placed it in the newly cleaned temple.

As a result of all this effort I was made a Chosen One, which gave me some spell ability. Well, a first level spell is called Ceremony, which is used to ordain clerics. As orcs were attracted to the temple I make some clerics. I then used the combine spell to boost our spell casting abilities. Did I mention the druid sidekick? They have great trap making spells. The rest of the party decided that there was too much orc power growing in the area and the temple needed to be destroyed. Well, it's amazing what you can do with some pretty low level spells when you have time to plan defenses.

The entire rest of the party was wiped out when they attempted to attack my temple. It so satisfying to watch them stumble into traps and ambushes. After playing with them for so many years I knew exactly the tactics they were going to use and it was a glorious slaughter! It ended the campaign, but good times! "

"Also not a social worker, but my mom was one for 20+ years. She spent most of that time on the emergency investigation unit side of things for CPS. she recently retired a few years ago.

I learned pretty quickly to not ask specific questions about her cases when she would get home from work. It just made her even more sad to have to talk about it with her kid. Sometimes I would walk in her room while she was working and catch her just bawling her eyes out so I would sit next to her and just quietly hug and hold her till she stopped. Even though I was a teenager and we didn't get along great due to typical teenager/mom drama, I know she appreciated that a lot.

It's really not any particular case that would stand out as the worst for her. It's the never ending relentless stream of horrible shit she has to deal with. Like she'd spend one day in the hospital with a family that beat their kid to death, and then the next day she's back again with a family that sold their kid to a pimp who beat her, and then the next day she's at the Mexican border trying to find a home for a newborn who was literally abandoned and thrown over the border wall. There's just no time to recover it's just on to the next case.

"I eavesdropped on my older brother having sex one night when I was maybe 15. Our house had a central vac with an outlet in each room, and by putting my ear up to my outlet I could hear pretty well into my brothers room because the cover on his outlet was broken. 

Anyway, I listened to my brother going at it for a while, getting a good laugh out of it, and making plans to spy on whoever came out. He didn't have a gf at the time, so I was very curious who was in there. Our doors were close together, so I left mine open a bit and lay in wait right by the door so I could peek out. After a while the noise stopped and I heard footsteps toward the door. 

I saw my brother come out and go straight to the bathroom. I heard him taking a piss, then he walked back. He left the bathroom light on, so there was some light shining at my door. I ducked back a bit to not be seen, and so I missed the next person coming out of his room. They walked into the bathroom too. Then I heard them pissing. It was a guy, standing up pissing. 

I saw his best friend walk out of the bathroom and go back into the room. I waited a while to see if a girl came out too, but no. That was it. 

I was so surprised I crept into my sister's room, woke her up and told her what I saw. She never mentioned it again, and I never told my bro. He has since had many gf's, been married and all that. It weirds  me out to this day. Not because of what he did, but because it was so unexpected. Caught me totally offguard. "

It was pretty loud too, and i was on edge for the rest of the night. It sounded a few more times throughout the night. Its eerie to be totally surrounded by the calming noises of nature and then hear that, especially when im in an area that hasnt had any sort of tornado, or severe natural disaster in a few decades. After returning, i did some research and i cant find anything about any warning sirens being in place in that area, nor could i find the source of the sound "

"I've lived on both sides of the budget in PC building.

The price isn't the important part. You can find great hardware brand new at a low price if you do your research and find the right make and model. It almost certainly won't be the cheapest, but it'll be close and it won't fail before the computer is obsolete. Power supplies are the prime example here.

The computer parts industry preys on people who are poorly informed and it rewards people willing to do consumer research to find the quality parts at any given price point. You need to know enough about the specs and requirements of your build to know  what you need and what you don't need to waste money on. For every company that's willing to sell you a crappy power supply that's going to fail in 6 months there's another company that wants to sell you an over priced power supply that has pumped up wattage ratings on rails where you'll never use it. 

Getting a good quality power supply at a good price means doing your homework and being a nerd - an actual ""I researched all of this and I could write a forum post summarizing the various options on the market right now"" nerd, not just a ""lol, I play so many video games. I'm such a nerd"" nerd. You need to be more hard OCP than thinkgeek.

More than anything, set aside the money you can spend on parts and wait for sales and watch Craigslist or /r/hardware swap like a hawk. You can build a much better computer over 6 months time than you can spending all the money today because your money is going to go further. 

Also, if you need to be cheap, don't pay for aesthetics. You don't need a $200 case when an ugly $50 case will get the job done. You don't need RGB fans or individually sleeved power supply cables. These are luxuries that won't affect your computer's performance."

"When I was in the hospital with sepsis and endocarditis and a fever of 105 for a couple months, I was dimly aware of existing in two realities at once (neither of them were the real world; it was just one hallucination and another hallucination).

It was sort of like impossibly long strands of that metallic/plastic-y Christmas tinsel, but all different colors and bound together in these super-thick hanks. 

Also I was the head writer on a ""Parks and Rec"" style comedy that kept changing its title between ""Call, Don't Fall!"" and my full name. I knew the cast and crew of that show better than I knew any of my doctors or nurses.

The next day I get a phone call from the hospital saying they'd found four breaks in my leg and that I should ""probably come in and get it checked out"". Mum was in that same hospital at the time so I got a taxi there. Once I was at the hospital they x-rayed me again and said I'd need to fast because I was probably gonna need surgery. I fasted for 2 days and was then told I didn't need surgery.

Similar thing happened to me once. Few workmates and myself decided to have a bbq by the river. Found a great spot and set up the bbq. There were a good few of us and so we soon found two trees to relieve ourselves. One for guys and one for girls. End of the day we packed up and I left my car there having drunk way to many myself. The next day I returned to get my car and the whole place was taped off by police and forensic units. Turns out if any of the guys had looked up at any point we would have seen a guy hanging a couple of feet away from our heads. He had committed suicide and had a note sewn to his clothes.

They went on about the things as long as we could hear the station. These were grown adults talking seriously about a video game as though it were as significant a social issue as healthcare or education."

"Pageantry.

The rumors you hear about producers being paid off, girls hoeing themselves out to place, etc. are true more often than most realize.

What we pageant girls often refer to as ""Pia Moments"" (where the wrong winner is crowned; you guys are probably more familiar with it being called a ""Steve Harvey Moment"") happens a lot more than most people realize. If you've competed in a number of pageants, there's a good chance you've either witnessed or experienced it yourself. 

I had my ""Pia Moment"" at a national pageant when I was 18. I won't name the pageant system, but I was given First Runner-Up on stage to a girl whose parents we later found out had paid off the ""head honchos"" in order to get the crown. The judges' scores were manipulated, and we all knew something was up because it took an hour and a half for our scores to be tallied up. Mind you, the only scores needing to be tallied up were for 15 girls who made the Top 15.

We found out what happened immediately after the show when we were pulled backstage. One of the ""head honchos"" took all of the money the ""winner"" had paid (which was to be divided evenly among 3 head honchos) and left the fucking country mid-show! Once the other ""head honchos"" found out, they pulled us all backstage, told us what happened, and stripped the girl of her crown. I was the actual winner - everybody was simply bumped up one place because the ""head honchos"" bumped us all down a spot to crown the fake ""winner."" They did this backstage to avoid publicly humiliating her (after all, she DID do her part in paying them the money. It's the least they could've done for her).

I was legit just pissed that I didn't get my ""crowning moment"" on stage. Fucking bummer. "

"My dad was incredibly strict while I was growing up. Two of his stupidest rules were: 1.) my brother and I had a bed time of 9pm until I was a senior in high school, 2.) bed time was so strict that we weren't allowed to get up and use the bathroom after 9pm, and 3.) he made us have a babysitter until I was 14 years old. Of course, he denies ever doing any of these things to this day.

**Edit**: Another very stupid rule was no locked doors in the house, ever. As in, locking the bathroom door wasn't allowed and my dad proclaimed that he should be allowed to come into any room in *his* house at any time he wanted. He would often try to come into my brother and my rooms while we were changing or something, so I got into the habit of changing my clothes very quickly and only when our dad was upstairs or something."

"I've told this before on Reddit but why not again? 

A couple of days before the incident I had kissed this girl who had a boyfriend (we're late teens). I knew she had a boyfriend (I was a jerk back then, I know it). We worked at the same summer job. The next night after ""the kiss"" the boyfriend is waiting for me at my car to fight. She must have told him I had kissed her. Ok, this is fair, he deserves to fight me. We fight and it's over fairly quickly. No real damage to either of us and we shake hands afterwards. I thought our problems were finished. I didn't talk to the girl anymore out of respect for the boyfriend. A day or two later she comes up to me a says ""we're having a party and if you'd like to come you're welcome to"". I found it odd that she would invite me to a party but my buddy and I weren't doing anything that night so we went. 

So we show up to the party. Everything's seems normal. The girl's there and a about forty other people. The boyfriend's not there yet. It's a typical college house party: music, drinks and people shuffling from group to group talking. I don't know anyone there except my buddy and the girl. I talk to her but make it a point to not talk too much to her. So I'm just drinking and mingling with people when my buddy comes up to me and says : ""we're leaving!"" I'm like ""what?"" He replied ""we're getting the fuck out of here now!"" And speed walks out the front door. I'm follow him thinking (WTF is wrong with you?)


We get into the car and close the doors. And he tells me: ""dude, everyone in there was staring and pointing at you"" he didn't know what was coming but it wasn't good. 

Just then the boyfriend pulls up (I recognize his car from the night we fought) and about 30 seconds later gunfire goes off. We get the hell out of there. 

Come to find out boyfriend got girlfriend to lure me to her house so he could wave a gun in my face(I don't think he wanted to kill me, not with forty witnesses but who knows?)

I quit that job the next day. "

"That's not really what the movies about tho. the point is that tyler durden's ""rebellion"" is a just a replacement for the society the narrator leaves behind. If you pay attention, the movie is about masculinity and the way we cling to it, even when it isn't good for us. Note that the only time Jack is really happy is when he's in the support group for testicular cancer survivors, men who have been literally emasculated but are okay with it. Over the course of the film he exhibits a madonna/whore complex, unable to connect with Marla, either seeing her as a sex object in his tyler persona or a whore in his narrator persona. its only after he kills tyler that he can connect with her, not romantically, but as a friend. The moral of the movie is not that society and consumerism is emasculating, its that the importance that we place on power and masculinity is what allows society, and by extension, project mayhem, to control us.

"I recently found out that one of my aunts was engaged to someone other than my uncle for her entire senior year of high school. Her fiancé was overseas in the army, and they were going to get married when he came back. But my uncle, who had been off exploring the country and living life, came back to the small town my aunt was living in and started hanging out with her. He had fancied her back in the day, and apparently still did. After a little while, he told my aunt that he was moving to Alaska to make his riches, but he didn't want to leave without her. Now, my aunt hated her town and was looking for the quickest ticket out of there. She thought it'd be through the army boy, but instead it was through my uncle. She married him after she graduated and left for Alaska a few days later, and army boy didn't find out that she was married and gone until after he came back from overseas looking for her.

I also found out that another uncle, who I see as the sweetest, frail old man out there, but was apparently quite the player growing up, has a child somewhere in Japan from his days in the army.

Edit: I actually didn't find these things out by accident; my Mom and Dad spilled a lot of family secrets to me at dinner a few weeks ago. Fun fact: the people sitting in the booth next to us were very clearly listening in. I hope they enjoyed all of the scandals.

Edit 2: I love my aunt, but I agree with you all. I couldn't believe my Dad when he told me she did that. And no, army boy didn't find out at all until he came back and one of her friends told him she had gotten married and was gone. My Dad says she didn't have a mailing address for him, but I don't know if she would've written him a letter even if she did."

"So, a member of the party had to go to the local Magistrate and my character and another were sent for supplies. One of the items we needed was ale for the dwarf.

We found a pub, but we didn't speak the language. The DM rolled and decided there was a huge misunderstanding and the proprietor was under the impression we were looking for troll sex. We procured the ale but failed the roll to clear up the misunderstanding.

I was put in a room with a randy troll ready to go. Through a lucky roll I convinced him I could be pitcher and he would be catcher. He put his hands up against the door and turned his back to me. I took my short sword and rammed it up his arse, then jumped on his back and continued arse-swording him til he died. 

We walked out of the pub and never went back to that area of the city.

"Just an attempt:
I live in a quiet neighborhood up the streets from a nice, private university. Most of my neighbors have lived in the area for at least 5-10 years, my landlord has owned my house for 34 years at this point.
After finishing a bottle of wine and deciding we were in the mood for a second one, I volunteered to walk to the corner liquor store (less than 3000 feet away) and grab one. Didn't even bother locking the front door or bringing my phone since I've done it a million times.

As I'm walking in the dark along some bushes, a guy pulls up next to me and asks if I need a ride. I say no thanks, he speeds off and leaves. A few seconds later, I hear tires squealing, and see the car coming back from the opposite direction, the tires squeal again and I hear the engine rev.

I broke out running at a full pace with this car following me the whole time. By the time I arrived at the liquor store, the girl inside sees the panic on my face and locks the front door and calls the cops.

The guy was just sitting outside staring in. The cops arrived about 10 minutes later, in time for him to drive off. Since he hadn't done anything illegal at that point, I doubt they were able to ticket him.

After he buzzed off, I waited a few minutes in time to see a neighbor heading to the convenience store and had him walk me home. I'm not sure what would've happened to me, but I always drive whenever I head over now."

Well, the other old fart behind the counter was busy (and a new hire) and I had seniority (though not manager). They asked about a price for a brake line repair. I told him that I would have to inspect the vehicle first so I can give him an accurate estimate, but he insisted on a ""rough estimate"". I gave it to him and he shook his head no and laughed, looking at the other old fart. 

I told him, ""He can't help you. This is the average price. Could be more, could be less."" The other old fart told him that I was right and he left. 

Still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth when old farts judge me based on my age thinking I don't know anything. "

My mother's family has a ton of personal ghost stories floating around (Irish, and very into that in the country especially when she was growing up and ESPECIALLY when *her* mother was growing up). 

Her mother always told one about when they were staying with family way out in the country (just her and my mom, grandad was elsewhere) and therefore sharing a bed. Granny was reading, and mum was supposed to be asleep. My mum, apparently, (she was a kid at the time, quite young) said something along the lines of ""Mum, who's that beautiful lady?"" and Granny not really paying attention answered ""Who, love?"" thinking she was asking about someone she'd seen earlier in the day. 

""That beautiful lady sitting at the foot of the bed. She's brushing her hair and smiling."" 

Apparently my grandmother was so abjectly terrified by this that she pulled the covers over her head and just started essentially going ""Ah jaysus, jaysus..."" etc. 

The banshee, according to legend, follows certain families in Ireland (including ours, if you believe the myth) and this is one way she can appear to people heralding a death (unlike the more infamous wailing/keening banshee). My grandmother was both quite religious and verrrrry superstitious about this kind of thing, so this was basically her worst nightmare. 

She said my mother was super calm, just sitting up in bed saying ""But mum, she's so beautiful, you don't need to be scared of her."" and things like that. Until she just rolled over eventually and went to sleep while my grandmother was quaking in terror next to her."

Wear a backpack, stuff it with clothes or something fairly light.  They like to attack from behind and jump on your back, so a backpack can buy you a few precious seconds to react and grab your bear mace that you wouldn't have otherwise.

Also, get a cheap halloween half mask and wear it on the back of your head.  They usually won't attack if they think they've been seen, so they try to sneak up behind you (and hence jump on your back).  They see the eyes of the mask and think you've got two faces and back off."

- Retired military of 12 years, deployed multiple times to all the popular places.  
- Full time nurse.  
- Part time EMT.
- Full time college student (masters degree for nursing)   
- Mother.  
- Went to college for ""super-cool-computer-hackey-stuff-only-possible-in-movies.""     
- Currently in litigation.  
- Owns her own business (photography) and has at least 2 workers, but she'll still do shoots herself.    
- Has a social life.  
   

      
Only a couple of those can be/have been easily explained. Such as she has shared custody of her daughter, or that college classes aren't running right now. But some of those just weren't adding up in my mind, and all evidence started pointing to ""run bro"" real quick.    
     
One example is she showed me her business' s facebook page and started saying how this number is 2 million views, and that 34 is 34 million views. Yet is was plain as day just three thousand four hundred. On top of that but she has an event set up with only 1 person attending. My first thought was  ""how is 1 person attending with 34 million page views?""  Better yet, how does she only have 2 workers with those numbers? Or how is there that many page views in a town of only 70k (per 2016 census)?     
     
This is just one example, and I seriously doubt she was talking her self up in an attempt to impress me."

Basically I told her, as an adult, she needs to make a choice now. We were only about two weeks into the relationship, I said I liked her a lot and thought she was a great friend, I trusted her and didn't care if she's friends with exes or guys but she needs to stop this playing both sides or I'm out. It was completely in her hands and she could have left me and did what she wanted to do but she, thankfully, stopped it with the ex when she realized I was serious. And of course this goes both ways with me since I believe nothing is more important than trust in a relationship. If she can't trust me to live my life without her worrying about what I'm doing than who am I to expect the same from her?"

"If you get all technical with Catholicism specifically, Hell is defined as the furthest you can get from God without Him abandoning you completely. If He really did abandon you completely, you would cease to exist, past, present, future. So, you're never truly apart, just ""distant."" 

In another interesting way, the technical Catholic definition of Heaven is perfect communion with God. In many ways it resembles the Hindu belief of nirvana, in that it is becoming a part of God (the All) and leaving your personal self behind. 

If you compare and contrast that view with the view of Hell, you could also describe Hell as being too focused on the individual and not enough on the All. Or, in other words, being too wrapped up in yourself and the world immediately around you. Which is unusually similar to the concept of Maya, or Illusion. 

I study religions semi-professionally, and the similarities of Hinduism and Catholicism fascinate me."

My ex lost her father a number of years ago. She said she had never seen it but wanted to. She was a blubbering mess afterward. We fucked later that night. It's a pretty good movie.
"How my soon to be ex wife fucked me over:

My wife and I started having problems when my step son started getting to the age of rebellion. I would try and discipline him and she would step on my toes and let him do whatever he wanted. One day I end up punching the door and scarring everyone because my step son told me he didn't love me and that I'm not his real father. I raised him since he was 2. He's ten now. So my wife leaves me. I have a legitimate daughter with her. It's been over a year and my wife tells me she can't focus on her job and school because my daughter is too young for school yet. She let her son live with his biological father. I convince her that my daughter should live with me while we go through a divorce. So after 3 months she wanted our daughter back. I told her no that she had just moved in with me. Meanwhile she's stubborn on making a shared custody plan and she's stubborn on how to split our material things. She asks me if our daughter can go down and visit for the 4th of July holiday. I agree and she takes her to the state she resides at and bought her health insurance and enrolled her in school and a bunch of other things that I immediately did when she came to move with me. Then she filed for divorce in that state. Now I can't legally go get my daughter back after this 4th of July holiday because the child can not leave the state until the end of the divorce. 

She is going to take everything from me. 

Edit: I have spoken to a divorce lawyer and I'm kinda just sitting on my hands. I need to prove that it's in my daughters best interest to live with me. Should I fail, I won't do anything that will harm my image to my daughter. I always think back to a question I've been asked before, if you can trade places for a day with anyone, who would it be?

I would choose my daughter to trade places with. So she can see with my own eyes and heart how much she means to me. I love her with all my might. "

I called a staff meeting. Laid down the rules that no more personal stuff would enter this building. No more phone calls or texts to me unless it's work-related. In regards to the minor smokers issue, we would just do our job, ignore the bait, and they would get bored and do something else as 16 year olds do. I reminded everyone of the existing power structure. I'm the top of the pyramid, and Assistant Manager is assistant manager. We are the only ones that have any actual power. I also introduced a write-up program, which we never had before. We didn't have to have one, but now it was becoming necessary. 

First thing Bob does is try to tell me what happened in his life while I was away. He found himself a new girlfriend, the pregnant literal-ex-as-of-one-day-before-he-moved-in-with-her of his cousin's. He bought a new minivan because they were going to have a family together. He's going to claim the kid, to hell with his cousin. I told him I didn't want to hear it. He then complained to all the customers during his shift about how unfair I'm being and saying that the gas station is going to go to shit in quality because it won't be so ""friendly"" anymore. These customers complained about him and I hit him with a write-up for insubordination. He started calling in sick a lot, saying that all these old medical issues of his were flaring up. Within 2 weeks, I was working all of his shifts while he waited for a doctor to get back to him. When the doctor did, Bob bowed out of his job. I only just hired someone to replace him last week. 

I still see Bob once in a while, since he buys smokes, gas, and lotto tickets from my store. He walks with a cane. Limps. Sometimes he forgets it and when he noticed that whoever's on shift is watching him it'll come back. He's still with that girl and every once in a while I hear through the grapevine that neither of them really have friends anymore and that the actual father of the baby is absolutely devastated. I'm glad I'm not involved anymore. 

I apologize again for the length. I don't know if anyone is actually going to read this. It just felt good to maybe get this out of my system one last time so I can forget about it completely. "

"I'll give you the big picture sort of version of ""adapting"" for me.  It came in stages to me.  I can try to highlight some advice for your big changes.

1.  If you do dorm life, it's pretty exciting to be living with people your age who are just as confused as you, but it is like living in a little high school with less supervision from authority sometimes, which I hope explains itself.  It gets dulled by cafeteria food and being in small spaces with people whose lives will clash with yours.  If there's any program that puts you in a hallway with people in similar majors/interests as you, this can be good for developing a peer group in your field and for homework/studying perhaps.  A lot of irreversible awkwardness can come out of thirsty/drunk versions of you, mind you.  And in one way or another you may realize you're [untethered](https://youtu.be/xkJd5oQXt4g?t=26s) and know no bounds, in good or bad ways, so you need to become the person who sets boundaries for yourself rather than authority figures.  You will see people go fucking insane and they sometimes have a way better time then you, but then they have a way worse time than you, and sometimes they keep having a much worse time than you for a long time.  It's okay to not go insane or let people drag you along with their insanity.  Don't be an asshole but don't be a pushover.  Do good work but have a good time.  Parts will suck a lot, but stay on an even keel and you'll make it.

2.  A big environment change is a good time to build new habits since your previous lifestyle is destroyed and you're left to reorganize yourself somehow.  It's harder to build new habits where you are now since you've probably been in the same place for years and associate your current habits with the places you regularly are at, so college is a great fresh start if you do it right.  If you can figure out a routine of things you would like to do habitually, like studying regularly or going to the gym or even include leisure things like just going to a place to relax, figure out a schedule for yourself as soon as you get settled and learn when and where things are.  Start yourself on a simple routine of things that you want to improve in yourself and it will help keep you sane and from feeling like your life is nebulous and weird more than it has to.  Do your daily good things for a few weeks and you'll start doing them automatically rather than making yourself do them.  In a way, you will develop some kind of routine regardless of your efforts, so a routine of waking up late, shuffling around to find food, looking at social media anxiously, and getting work done inefficiently may become your default unconscious routine if you don't create your own one first.

3.  If you move out of dorms and into an apartment or something, this is it's own transition.  That feels more like a true step into independence as far as your living space.  This comes with more responsibilities since you're paying rent and living more like a self sufficient citizen rather than a student.  Don't write over-dramatic passive aggressive notes for your neighbors on the first day of living there. (happened to me)

4.  When you don't feel like going to your parents' house is home anymore, I think this is more of graduation than actual graduation.  Once you really start thinking for yourself financially and philosophically, you're really an adult."
"I have worked in a shelter for almost two years and how the staff and supervisors treat their patrons and the rules that are set in place make a huge difference. My city has two shelters for women. The one I work at is in an older building, but is known for clean conditions and respectful staff. The other has a state of the art building with all the amenities, but the staff is known to be abusive of their power and treat the women like they're criminals. Human decency and respect go a long way. "
"I went to all-girls high school and we had to wear uniforms. We had several days throughout the year that we were allowed to wear regular clothes, but they had to be dresses/skirts, essentially church clothes. Well, one student was super butch and said she wouldn't wear a dress or skirt. The faculty asked if it was an identity thing (aka being trans I guess) and apparently it wasn't. She just hated dressing ""girly"". Instead of being reasonable and trying to negotiate maybe allowing dress pants or a suit, she literally bitched a fit and had a childlike meltdown during an all-school assembly.

The school decided not to have any more regular clothes days and the entire school had to go back to uniforms every day."

"Hey ya by outkast. It was the hit dance song of the early 2000s with a two word chorus.

"I think (adult) people these days put too much value in 'spark', in relationships/dates and in friendships. They seem to remember their friendships from their younger years as these immediate spark thingies that you just hit it off and go!

So when people are trying to make friends they give each other about 2 hours and then they're like, ""That was nice, but I can't see us ever becoming close friends"". 

The truth is that most of us have become very adept at hiding in order to facilitate smooth everyday transactions, and while we will say about ourselves that ""Other people couldn't possibly know the real me in two hours"", we simultaneously say about other people ""I am good at reading people, I can know who you are in about two hours"". 

This results in us only making friends with people we feel an instant connection with... and in many cases, that's either nobody (bad first date but awesome long-term friend), or that's somebody who happens to be awesome for the first two hours and sucks afterwards (great first date but has social ADD and sucks at being consistent)

EDIT for TLDR
TLDR Maybe find ways to give it more time with the same people rather than looking for a spark with lots of new people"

"The worst employee I've known is a girl who told me she hated waking up to come to work so in order to sleep longer in the morning, she would put her clothes on the night before and sleep in them and roll out of bed and come straight to work. She never wore pants, only thick leggings under heavy skirts. She lived with her parents and their 20 cats and would always be covered in cat hair. She didn't brush her hair and always wore a beanie, even inside. She eventually got fired due to it as she was a sales rep for our company. "
Honestly... I got my lasik through a groupon and it work out fine. They ended up upselling me on warranties and shit which ended up costing another 2k but still... grouponed it.
"Three years ago, a friend and I were driving back from downtown, just chatting away. He was driving and I was in the passenger's seat. I noticed a large entity laying in the street near the local drive-in theater. From a distance, it looked like an animal of some sort - roadkill, maybe? As we got closer, the thing got bigger. As my friend drove by it, we noticed it was a person.

The man lying on the ground got up and stumbled toward us as we were slowing down to make a U-turn. As my friend turned his car around to go help the guy, we hear a loud thud. I look to my right outside the passenger window and there's blood smeared all over the window and mirror on my side of the vehicle. My friend stops the car immediately, and the man is banging on my window, begging for help. 

He's a large black man and half of his jaw was missing. It looked like something straight out of The Walking Dead. He had been shot in the face and chest, and it was clear that only adrenaline was keeping him alive. My friend was terrified, so he froze up...but my adrenaline kicked in as well and I just didn't care - I wanted to take action to save this guy's life. I immediately got out of the car to assist him. My friend thought I was nuts because I didn't know this guy but I was jumping out of the car in a dangerous area to help him without giving a fuck about how drenched in his blood I was becoming. My friend dialed 911 as I tried to calm the man down to keep him from injuring himself further. I kept asking him to tell me what happened, but all he could say was ""Help me please, I'm dying."" I grabbed his hand and lead the way as he stumbled to the curb with me. I sat with him as he laid himself back onto the ground and tried to assure him that everything would be ok. I looked behind me toward the drive-in theater and noticed a pickup truck crashed into a telephone pole with the driver's side window blown out. We were on the border of the dangerous side of town, so I knew instantly what had happened. 

Police showed up and started questioning my friend and I while the paramedics arrived and took the man to the hospital. We were questioned from like 2 AM until about 6 AM. Turns out someone shot the guy through his window as he was driving. It was determined that this was not a random act of violence, and the guy was someone else's target. They never discovered a motive for the shooting. The poor guy died of his injuries the next day. The worst part is that they never found his killer. I'll never forget the way his face looked, or the sound of his voice as he desperately tried to make out his cries for help with his jaw missing. 

Here's a [link to a news article](https://www.google.com/amp/detroit.cbslocal.com/2014/11/14/police-seek-tips-in-death-of-man-found-shot-on-side-of-the-road/amp/) if you're interested. Poor guy was only two years older than my friend and I. 

EDIT: The news article says the man was given a ride by someone from the bar, but that isn't true. We think he was driving and may have been a bit intoxicated but was trying to avoid a potential DUI (if he were to survive) by not admitting to driving the vehicle - which wasn't in his name anyway. "

On one night I was helping a very drunk customer who refused to accept a policy (I don't remember exactly what it was). He asked to speak to the manager, but he and everyone else around me were crazy busy. So I turned my back on the customer, turned back around, pretended to be a different person, and backed myself up. He accepted this without issue and went on his way. "

"I believe there will be a huge political shift. Democracy as we know it is going to change. Corruption is everywhere, and its the system's fault. Its either going to crash, or its going to evolve. 

Here in Quebec its kinda crazy. We have the same problem as the US in that our governments partie's choice is decided between mostly 2 big dominant parties. 1 who has been stealing from us for years, cutting the budget to ""pay off the debt"" but keep adding to that same debt, and the other who is more nationalistic(you know, separatists) and that isnt capable of even explaining their own ideologie well enough for people to understand its goal and meaning for the Quebecois people. Its a mess, both parties are experiencing a terrible case of tunnel vision, they forget that their job isnt to try to defend themselves agaisnt the population, but to lead and protect them. 

I know alot of people who still believe in Quebec's separation from Canada. I used to too, but with the governments options we have now, Canada is the best bet.(not that trudeau is much better though, hes worse in some ways) 

So basically, I believe that the population is going to progressively get pissed for another 50 years, and then they'll be forced to change things, and I dont mean juat here in quebec, thats just an example of how things are now. Like sure, politics was and always will be a shady domain, but now they arent even hiding themselves, theyre just hiding enough evidence by using their political power to stay free.

"First off, you have to play to your strengths. If you're funny, make her laugh. Just don't overdo it. 

Second, be yourself, but be the best version of yourself. 

Learn about her. Ask her open ended questions. Don't ask ""Do you like your job?"" Instead ask ""What do you like about your job?"" You'll be surprised how well a conversation can go if you ask the right questions. 

If looks are your problem, look at what you can do to improve that part of yourself. Get a snazzy haircut. Save up some money and get some nicer clothes. Lose some weight, if that's an issue for you. (I know, I know. That's easier said than done. Just try.) AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR SKIN! Acne is a fact of life, but that doesn't mean you have to live with it. Go to a qualified esthetician, get a facial, and get on a skin care regimen. I promise you, it's worth it.

Don't jump straight into asking her out on a date. If you're going out with some friends, invite her along. If you want to hang out with her one on one, say something like ""Hey, I'm gonna go grab some lunch. Would you like to come with me?"" The best dates don't even have to be called a ""date"". 

Chill out with the compliments. Yes, you think she's a goddess. Don't call her that off the bat. It's creepy. Keep it low key and say stuff like ""I think you're a cool person."" or ""I like hanging out with you."" 

Finally, don't try to meet people online. I know it seems easier to meet people like that, but it has some serious drawbacks. Meet women face to face and let your strengths shine. That sounds difficult, but it doesn't have to be. Take up a new hobby. Go take a class at a community college. Just get out there.

TL;DR: Keep it casual, be yourself, don't rush things, ask open ended questions, and put a little more effort into your appearance. "

"I don't spend much time in seclusion, but I still have a story. I live in rural Ohio. One of my friends owns a nice barn and farm house out in the sticks where the buses don't run and there's no service. He doesn't actually live there, his family owns the house for shiggles. They're millionaires. We've never ran there and it's pretty scenic woods so we decided we'd give it a shot. 

He and I ran cross country and our team went to State that year to run so we were in really good shape. We get to his barn and plan on running 8 mi near a road and then through the woods. We have GPS watches so we can just make our own path and either turn back at four miles or make a looping path if we so desire.

After about two miles of running on the road we took a random gravel road through the woods and there was a hiking path through it so we decided to take it. We live in the country so it really isn't a big deal; we've done this sort of thing before. I've gotten lost in the woods and in runs a few time throughout high school. But we had never done it here so far away from home. I don't run with my glasses on and I'm blind as a bat. I'm making good pace when all of a sudden I smack into my friend. I look up, and he's just standing there. I focus at what he's looking at and there's bear trap hanging on a branch in front of us. Looking around, there more, all blowing in the breeze. Off in the middle perched up against tree was something that resembled a man. My friend pushed me and told me to run. We didn't say a word until we got back to the main road because we ran so fast. Turns out my friend saw what looked like a bloody scarecrow leaning against the tree. He saw bear traps on the ground, too. "

So I was suuuppper shy in school. I regularly ate my lunch in the bathroom  (yeah, gross, I know) because I couldn't handle eating in front of other people, then spent the rest of the period hiding in an abandoned corner of the library. I had no friends what-so-ever, and I was known around school as ""the quiet girl."" I was very of the opinion that I'd never find ""the one,"" because I couldn't even handle regular relationships with people, let alone romantic ones.

Near the end of my junior year in high school, I finally got formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and started on some pills and therapy, which seemed to help immensely. The summer before my senior year, I decided enough was enough and that I was going to make some friends, dang it.

Cue the first day of my last year. I was taking AP Bio (biology is a passion of mine), and there were about 12 of us do the teacher had us each introduce ourselves to the class. The girl sitting next to me introduced herself as Ella and stated that she loved Harry Potter. At the time, I was a huge Potterhead so I instantly clicked with this. When the teacher let us talk freely, I, with bated breath, went up to her. Feeling a bit confident, I asked her if it would be alright if I sat at her table during lunch that day. Lo and behold, she said yes. 

When I finally found her table at lunch, there were 2 other girls and one guy sitting there. I sat down and stayed mostly silent, cowed by the extra people. I was at the point of regretting the whole thing and giving up, when the guy, who'd also been quiet up to that point, made a direct reference to an obscure show I loved.

"Windex, and other standard glass cleaners, are abrasive. They will out right fuck up an LCD screen. 

If you are cleaning tvs, monitors, phones etc; use designated screen cleaner or just *make your own*. It's easy and cheap enough for a literal infinite supply. 

Buy gallon of distilled water. 

Buy biggest bottle of high percentage rubbing alcohol. 

Buy a new or reuse the spray bottle of screen cleaner you bought off of Amazon that was too small for ten dollars. 

3 parts distilled water and one part rubbing alcohol in the bottle. You now have screen cleaner for like 2-4 dollars.

Edit: wipe with micro fiber cloth to complete your kit. You can get a roll of like 5 - 10 micro fiber cloths at Walmart for 5 bucks.

Edit 2: as others have pointed out and after some googling - windex is NOT abrasive, but contains ammonia which will leave fucked up looking dark splotches on your screen. I was under the impression these 3 decades of life that it was abrasive and scratchy. 

Also, spray your screen cleaner on your micro fiber cloth then clean the screen. Never spray directly onto the screen."

"I'm 23, the past year I've lost about 60ish lb, going from 205lb to 140-ish my BMI is around 20.5. I'm not in shape now in the sense that I'm still soft and squishy and have spare skin, but I'm not carrying an extra 60lb of fat, so I can see both sides, having been obese and  now slim. 

Let me tell you man the difference is insane, I was getting knee pain that would make walking hard sometimes, I would sweat about 10x more, I always felt full and a little nauseous. I dreaded walking up 2 flights of stairs. My skin was even worse, greasy and dry at the same time all the time. Clothes didn't feel good, I felt gross. Not to mention I used to get some serious pain in my pancreas/gallbladder/liver area after drinking alcohol, now I don't and haven't had it since losing weight. Now I feel like I can actually move freely without my body chafing against itself. I can actually walk upstairs without being winded. I don't feel embarrassed and gross being outside, my confidence skyrocketed. 

Being fat is a fucking prison, and I feel a deep sorrow for those who make excuses to stay that way. And I can't even imagine how it must feel being 300+lb. "

"They were really worried the bombs wouldn't go off.  Had a completed but unexploded device fallen into German hands it could have advanced their own nuclear program by years.

Better to drop the bomb on Japan, get Japan to surrender as happened, and then turn and look at the Nazi's and say ""do you really want us to start doing the same to you?"" and see if you can force a surrender that way.  Really though the world would be a much, much, different place under this.  The real shock of WW2 is that both the Germans and the Japanese came away from the war disgusted with themselves for what they had done.  Had you started nuking german cities, or had a negotiated surrender where the horrors of the holocaust never fully came out, the world today would be much different than it is."

"How is happiness a choice?
Well i remember when my mom was depressed after my fourth brother she once woke up and smiled. After 4 months of being in her room, sad, dirty, and in pain, she smiled. I asked her why, and she said she just chose to smile. 

What? I always thought that you just couldn't gorce a smile in depression. My mother though, just chose to be happy. She went out and did errands (supervised) and when she finished her therapy  session the next week the therapist told us that she literally just chose to be happy. She was still depressed but chose to not show it and instead smile and laugh. Not sure how imo.

Honestly after that she had her ups and downs but i guess people have epiphanies about spending their time wisely. It opened my eyes to the fact that happiness can indeed be a choice but the strength it requires is a lot. "

"A few weeks ago this happened. 

I drove back home to my parent's house to stay over the weekend. I arrived around 630pm and I parked my car outside the house by the street. Usually a lot of people pass by not that much at night. 

My car is a new Honda Civic, I got last March. I always take it to the carwash before I go to my parents house every weekend. Nobody else but me has been in it because the last time I had family on my last car, they kinda wrecked the insides. 


I go to my room, I play an emulated PS2 game with my brother back in our childhood days, it was called: The Perfect Performer, a japanese beat style game. We played for hours and realized it was 2am and we were so hungry we decided to go drive to buy food. 

When we went inside our car, on the windshield, there were 2 very clear and small hand marks, side by side as if made by a small child. So, my brother told me, ""Stroud, someone put hand marks on your windshield."" so I'm like: ""Fucking street kids. No worries, I'll wipe it out. 

(Shit, I'm getting goosebumps writing this.) So off I went out and grabbed a chamois cloth and wiped it clean from the outside. When I was done, my brother said: ""Stroud, the hand marks are inside."""

"I had a similar experience growing up, my parents weren't abusive or degrading in any way, but they weren't really *there*, involved like parents should be.


My dad was hardly ever around(fellow military brat) due to his assignments and deployments and my mom worked and even when not working she wasn't so much a parent as a guardian. I was a latchkey kid, and much of the time my brother and I were home alone and nearly always had to make our own dinners. My parents would congratulate for good grades and stuff like that but there wasn't much encouragement or praise or anything and while they took us a lot of places(national parks, zoos, museums, etc) even when I try to think back on those trips I can only remember the educational aspects - I don't really have any memories of us spending time together as a family.


I would go to friend's houses and be like 'whoa, your mom cooks for you?' 'you eat dinner together?' 'you got *insert present* for *insert accomplishment*?' 'what's game night?' 'why does your mom want to meet my mom? my mom never wants to meet my friends/their parents' and over time I slowly realized it was *my* family that was off, not theirs. I think my friend's parents picked up on it some too and kind of adopted me into their family - they'd ask me about school, extracurriculars, invite me over for dinner at least 2x a week and send me home with leftovers, and sometimes even buy me things that my parents weren't involved enough to know I needed.


Thankfully it was after the last military move my family made, when I was ~12 or so, that I gained a couple great 'adopted' parents through my friendships and I owe them a lot for just being there for me growing up all through my teenage years and into my early 20s and we're still close. Pretty sure without them I wouldn't be where I am in life."

This Hispanic woman who'd been coming in for 2 weeks trying to get set up with services was finally sorted. Finally.

She comes walking downstairs with her excited brood of eleventeen children running ahead of her.

It's the Wednesday before Thanksgiving 4:15 pm. In her mind, she's got the food situation sorted just in time for the holiday. In my mind I'm like ""oop, you're fucked. And we're closed tomorrow. And of course we're closed Friday too because this is the government. And the weekend well that's a given. You'll have to skip work and drag ass back in next Monday just so I can take 4 minutes and turn your shit on""

So.

Fuck it.

I turned her shit on. I gave her kids a holiday.

So of course come Monday I have an angry email from the Capitol. I explained my reasoning. I was written up.

"This is long and a little more than what you asked for. There's a little bit of sweet sweet justice at the end too if you read all the way through so bare with me. I don't work there anymore, but I used to work at a natural foods grocer. There was this one assistant store manager named Jorge who was a total fucking scum bag, he was married with two kids and would cheat on his wife every opportunity he got. With customers, with subordinate employees, you name it. He wasn't very shy about it either, and one year started making out hard with a girl at the christmas party right before going upstairs and getting a room with her. He would also blatantly check out women and grab his crotch on the sales floor, to the point that he was talked to about how he had to wash his hands after touching his crotch because people were complaining. To top it off he plastered his office with pictures of his family like that was going to make up for being a cheating piece of shit. 

Anyways, the company I worked for had five locations. He worked at one by the coast, I didn't. One day he was randomly transferred to the store I worked at, and no one had known that was going to happen, which was strange because internal transfers were always posted on the bulletin board like a week before it was finalized to give other people an opportunity to apply for the same job or transfer or whatever. Well it came out pretty quickly that this guy had been transferred for sending dick pics to a married with children female customer (there was speculation hat he'd been cheating with this woman but she turned him in when her husband found out). The only reason he didn't get fired was because he went to high school with the head of the company (upper management at this job was basically a good ole boys club of guys who had played high school football together or some dumb shit like that). Within a few days everyone knew why he'd been transferred, and it became incredibly awkward to have to work for the guy, like way more than it already was.  

But wait, there's more! So he's been transferred now, and is in a new store with an opportunity to start fresh. What does he do? Starts carrying on extramarital affairs with Christmas party girl IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE STORE AFTER HOURS. The only reason people found out was because my friends hung out in the parking lot to smoke bowls after work sometimes and they watched her get in his car and go down on him one time. At that point everyone had had enough of his shit but was fully aware that he wasn't gonna get fired unless management's hand was forced. Fortunately, Jorge obviously had more blood pumping through his dick than his brain, because he struck up a new ""friendship"" with another married frequent customer who'd always come in with all 3 of her kids (but without her husband) at the store he and I now worked at. This time though, it was the furthest thing from a secret, and although they wouldn't hook up in his car right outside the store during business hours, they would often retreat to the parking lot to ""have lunch"" or destroy their marriages or whatever. Well, this was a little too bold, and one day, this loud mouth gossipy chick who everyone hated decided that it was time to put her gossipyness to good use and permanently redeem herself in the eyes of pretty much everyone. She saw Jorge go out to the parking lot with this woman, and so she called Jorge's wife and told her EVERYTHING right then and there, including that if wife came to the store right now she'd catch him red handed. That's exactly what happened, and although I didn't witness it first hand, apparently his wife showed up and yelled at him in the parking lot for like an hour while he was still in his work uniform (had the company's name in huge lettering on the back) and during peak business hours, then she came into the store and yelled at everyone she knew who was a part of upper management and was friends with him, all the while customers are all around and getting a little more info than they probably wanted. Jorge was fired and escorted from the store by the head of the company himself, and he and his sancha were both banned from all locations for life. Wonder how sancha's conversation went with her husband about why they had to find a new place to buy groceries?

TL;DR: member of upper management cheated on his wife regularly, got transferred for sexual harassment of a customer instead of fired, ended up getting caught red handed by his wife in the parking lot of the store during peak business hours, resulting in him getting fired, escorted out in front of the whole store, and banned from company property for life"

Here's a pretty [old source from 2011](http://247wallst.com/investing/2011/01/13/the-ten-companies-that-control-the-death-industry/), it's gotten much worse since then.

I remember when I made arrangements for my dad's funeral, I knew the owner of the funeral home and he was straight up with me. He gave me the casket at cost, instead of the 300% markup.

Suggested that we don't embalm my dad, just do the bare minimum (makeup, things to keep fluids from leaking, etc).

This was 30 years ago, normally back then a moderately priced funeral would have costed 5k easy, I wound up paying 1500.

"As the manager of a communication agency, I'd say toxic people: workers that always believe the company is scheming something, that does whatever is possible for co-workers to distrust the company and so on. 

We had one of those with us for 1,5 year. It was horrible. She ""contaminated"" good workers, told outright lies about things we offered her, faked her sallary so her peers would think she earned much more, among other things. 

In the end, we fired her, but her contamination led us to fire other two people who believed her and started redoing her toxic work. And no matter how many times we told them the things she told them were lies, they wouldn't believe. "

"I was 15 years old. My girlfriend and I had been having sex for a little while, and were trying out as many things as possible. 

  One day we were hanging out in the basement of my house and we decide that we want to try out titty fucking.  

  After a bit of logistics, we figure out sitting ""spider style"" with both of our butts on the ground and my legs wrapped around her torso is the best way to go about it. 

  So, I am fucking her tits, getting super into it. I close my eyes, and blow my load. Well, at this time she leans away, so my dick is pointed straight up. 

Jizz goes EVERYWHERE. Her face, hair, the wall, floor. 

I open my eyes to make direct eye contact with...my mom. 

Apparently she came down stairs right as I was cumming. 

She doesn't say a word, turns around and goes back up stairs. I eventually follow. 

She just says ""I think it's time for her to go home""

Me: Yup!

Remember, I am 15, so my mom has to take her home. 

To this day, neither of us has spoken a word about ""the incident"". "

"Strap yourself in ladies and germs... I worked as an installation technician in home security for 5 years and I can confidently tell you home security salesmen are the shadiest scum on the earth. They work in the business of ""keeping you safe"" so they already have a great facade to hide behind. 
What you may not know is that these guys have apps and databases that let them know specifically which houses to target. They have apps that have been specifically created to collect the ages of local residents based on private data collected, so they know which houses are elderly people which are their easiest targets. The second easiest is those who have been broken in to or burgaled recently. They have an app for that. Basically it's like the sex offender finder, but for those who would be more susceptible to their tactics because ""we've noticed a recent influx of robberies here in your neighborhood, oh you had a break in last year? I had nooooo idea. Let me come in and see what system you're working with"" 
Never let them in your house. I've watched their team meetings where They discuss the number one goal being to get inside the building. If they do that, they think they've made the sale. They can sell you from the doorstep if you're truly interested. Tell them to come back if it's raining out, don't pity them for being out in the rain. They chose to be out there selling that day and are counting on your generosity. 
The shortest contract you can get with any major dealer is 3 years. They'll try and sell you on 5 or longer, but just know that you have three days to cancel that contract. After that, if you cancel you'll owe them the remainder of your contract amount (your monthly rate×the amount of months left) and they will collect. From you, your loved ones if you pass on, if you move and don't wanna take it with. These guys get paid at least 250-500 bucks per sale they make. And I've seen guys sell 5 in A DAY. 
There's no motivation to actually help on that side of the industry. It's all a money grab. Giant companies buying each other out left and right. Company A starts up and goes out and scores 1000 customers in 2 years. They've met their goal so they sell to monitronics for a few million. Now you're with monitronics and you don't even know it. And a few years when monitronics comes to ""upgrade"" your system they're really just signing you in for another contract. There are even shady salesmen walking around pretending to be reps from your company, offering to upgrade with a contract signature but really just signing you to another company. 
They're gonna tell you that your security system is FREE (as long as you put up their sign in your yard, because they have a ""special short time offer for advertising customers"") but that fucking system costs less than 500 bucks and they're definitely adding that in to your total contracted amount. The more devices you add, your monthly rate starts increasing.. why? More coverage? Nope. You're always paying for those devices whether or not they're advertised as free. 
Oh and those device prices? Bullshit. Have them show you a piece of equipment(Honeywell Door window sensor for example) they will claim cost 2 points. Those points are equal to 30-50 dollars a piece, depending how much profit the salesmen wants to make off of them. Go look on Amazon while they're there and see how much that whole ""1000 dollar system"" really costs and see how red their face gets. 
I've loved shaming salesmen who lie to unsuspecting customers. I've helped people who have been lied to renegotiate and even told them to cancel if they've flat out been given 100% lies (which does happen unfortunately). Just don't trust security salesmen guys. They and the company they make money for have no interest in your well being. You're nothing but another 500 bucks to them in an hours work.

Tldr; security companies are targeting you and your neighborhoods and will say anything to get inside your house. Do not trust them. Buy and install your own system from home depot or amazon. You wouldn't believe how easy it is to set up a wireless security system without a provider that will deter any burglar who hears it go off."

"This reminds me of an unpaid internship I did. One day my job was to help out the concessions staff along with an intern coworker. We worked extremely hard for 12 hours to get zero compensation except a couple hot dogs. Afterwards, the concessions supervisor had us stay late to wash a mountain of dishes instead of assigning her numerous paid workers to do it. After getting most of the way done she came in, said thanks for the hard work, and told us we could go and that she would finish up. The next day we got called into our manager's office and yelled at for leaving unfinished work and had to go clean all the dishes we left. She had gone to him to say we were bad workers and had left without being told we could leave. He wouldn't believe that she told us to go. I still have no idea what her motivation for it was. This was 10 years ago and it still bothers me.

On a related note, I also got chewed out in front of everyone during a meeting by someone else on the concessions staff because I forgot to ask who was on the phone when they asked for him.

Tldr: Concession management need to chill."

"My boyfriend is in a full time job in the type of work he studied for.  I am finishing my degree, still.  

It definitely becomes difficult with three major factors:  Time management, money and maturity.  

Time is uncomfortable because I feel like I have so much more free time than him, but then to counter that I work a part time job that takes all of my Sunday.  This just needs to be organized around, and I think it's important for the person who's working full time to never assume the other is less busy just because they are not physically clocking in and out at the end of the day.

Money is self-explanatory.  He makes money, I hemorrhage it out of my broke, broke pockets.  For this I think there needs to be a balance of a show of self-sufficiency on my part, and a show of both generosity but also full belief I can do it ""on my own"" on his part.  Talking openly about financial differences is good, and I personally appreciate when it's acknowledged that he lives a much less anxiety-driven life because money is not an immediate concern for him.  This dynamic would change if I were to move in with him, but it would still be about willing to spend a ""percentage of what we have"" to make things work.

Finally, maturity.  Sometimes I feel like I sound like a child when I talk to him about my university shit while he's out there actually being a person and having a job, and the only way this can be cured is understanding that your partner, well, loves you.  They would not be dating you if they did not think you were a strong, capable person, especially if they are from a position with a lot more status/power/authority/what have you.  

This is a valid question, and I have definitely struggled with it a lot in my own time.  "

"Ok imma help out a pal right here. I am extremely hairy and relate too much. Here's bikini line shaving 101

1. Shower. The heat and water will help soften the hairs and make it easier to shave. (Beforehand trim the hairs so they're not too long)
2. Use a light exfoliater where you are planning on shaving. This helps remove excess skin so it avoids ingrown hairs. If you wouldn't use it on your face, don't use it on your vag
3. Instead of using shaving cream, use shampoo and lather it all up. 
4. Lightly run your razor not with or against the grain of hair but perpendicular. I'm not really sure how to explain this but you might get the idea.
5. Once you're done, rinse with cool/lukewarm water and pat dry to avoid irritation from a rubbing towel.
6. Put coconut oil where you shaved to moisturize. 

Hope it helps!! :))

"Fun fact, it would've been at least a few months between the second and third bomb being dropped; the bomb dropped on Nagasaki used the last of the fissile material the US had, there wasn't enough enriched plutonium/uranium for a third bomb (fourth, technically, since the first bomb was dropped in New Mexico as a test). 

Japan didn't know that, though. It's been speculated that, if they had, they may not have surrendered when they did. "

I play games, sure, but the reason I made them my career is because I love working on the kinds of interdisciplinary teams that it takes to make huge games. Sometimes it makes me want to pull my hair out, but at the end of the day there's nothing better.

"I was A RA in college. I was doing rounds when I could hear this insanely loud moaning from the stairwell. The dorm was a circular tower. The doors for two seperate rooms were set up maybe an inch or two apart on a corner. This was on our rainbow floor, which was designed to be very LGTBQ friendly.

I knocked on one door and a guy answered. I told him I was sorry for bothering him but to please keep the sex noises down. He said ""OK but it's not me.""
I replied ""I know it's not because it's a female moan."" 
He says ""no it's not me."" I hear the moans again. I ask him to open the door to see if there's a female in the room. All I see is his laptop on his bed. 
I say ""hey man IDC what you're into just put headphones in or turn it down."" Again the moans continue and he says ""dude it's not me."" He shows me his laptop is on some school related website. He then kind of glances and points to the door right next to his. 

I apologized profusely and realized what he meant by it's not me. I knock on that door. Moans continue no reply. I pound on it like a cop and scream ""RA!"" The door opens and there's a girl on the bed legs spread naked. Another girl naked has her face in between them and just turns around to look at me. I say ""enjoy your night but let's try and use our inside moans."" I shut the door and left. Didn't have a problem for the rest of the night with that floor. "

I was on my friend's couch with a trash can near me and they were all giving me shit for drinking too much. I was arguing with them that it wasn't me being drunk causing this sickness, but something I ate. 

Well, they kept giving me shit and it was pissing me off that they wouldn't believe me. One friend was laughing and mocking me saying ""you new to learn how to handle your booze"" when I had enough of it and snapped. So I jumped up, shouted ""I'M NOT FUCKING WASTED!"" and proceeded to punch the fridge in frustration. I broke two bones in my hand and had to wear a cast for six weeks.

"I lived alone in a 1 bedroom apartment for a year or so and loved it. About 3 or 4 months in I got a girlfriend and she started staying over a few times a week. One morning we were having breakfast and with a very serious look on her face she wants to talk to me about my sleeping habits. 

According to her, every time she'd stayed over, at some point in the the night I'd wake up and sit on the end of the bed, eyes open and facing the cupboard and I would have a conversation with ""someone"". Never for longer than 15 minutes and I'd crawl back into bed when I was done. 

She said she could only hear my voice and that there were pauses, like I was listening to them and then I'd respond. Sometimes I'd laugh and interestingly, there was also another language involved which she would hear me translating things for ""it"" back into English. I don't remember a thing. 

After this conversation I started to monitor the cupboard and realized that despite closing the cupboard door before bed each night, it was always open in the morning. In this same apartment I also had ""exploding head syndrome"" once. 

I moved out shortly after all this and according to her I never spoke to a cupboard in my sleep again. "

"""No lying."" Seems reasonable, maybe, but it's not.

This is going to get buried, but it's important, so I'm going to post anyways. It wasn't about the rules. It was about the CONSTANT INTERROGATIONS. There weren't so much rules, as there was her personality and the things that bugged her, and the fact she was going to interrogate the absolute shit out of us every single day. It's the complete lack of privacy and the total suspicion that makes living with this kind of parent the worst. Not even the whitest of lies, or the tiniest of omissions were acceptable.

Where were you? Why? When did you get there? When did you leave? Who else was there? What did you do? Why did you do this? And did so-and-so do that? Why did you let them? And how is that related to this other thing? Why did you just lie to me? It's hard to explain, maybe, but there was this Socratic lawyer-type method being applied constantly to invent lies to catch you in. Like she was looking for an excuse to backhand you, digging in until our memories failed to provide total consistency, and then she could ground us, or whatever. If she was in a bad mood, she'd scowl around the house until she found something out of place so she could scream at us. Screaming. Lots of screaming.

For ""strict"" parents, it's often not really about the rules. It's about ""respect"", which is a dog-whistle for total domination of the subordinates in the household. If there were rules, there would be times when I was allowed to do what I was doing without suspicion. This did not exist. 

Every single day on my way home from anywhere, I had to prepare a huge list of answers, try to find where she would dig in and build up the walls. Keep stories simple. Build big emotional walls. It mostly didn't work. We didn't really have a relationship. We didn't talk about my feelings.

"Very unlikely.

The USA (and other world superpowers) are criticized for not caring about civilian life when fucking around in other countries. But we have allowed ISIS to exist for a while because we don't know exactly where their government buildings are and firebombing the cities they occupy would kill a lot of civilians. If we had word that ISIS or another non-state actor were working on a nuclear bomb (which is pretty impossible to keep secret), we would be 100% capable of utterly destroying them, with alacrity. At that point, we wouldn't care at all about the civilian death toll. Right or wrong, it's what would happen.

"We used to have date nights. Late night movie shows, followed by dinner and a long walk back home. It was fun. The area wasn't really unsafe, we never worried about any kinda danger. One night around 11 pm, while we were walking back, a gang of guys surrounded us. They started speaking in a language I did not understand and kept on trying to touch me. I was very, very scared. They all looked like thugs. This was during the days when the entire country was rocking from the brutal death and rape of a young girl. The leader of that gang keep on making gestures at me to drink from the bottle in his hand. My lovely ex-boyfriend waited till their  attention was diverted by me and took off running. I was saved by 2 shopkeepers that day. They dropped me to my flat. I later got to know one of the gang had served jail time for sexual assault. The next day I got a text from my boyfriend, blasting me for the tightness of my jeans and top provoking such men. I still stayed with him. God I was an ass. But that day I realized, I can never count on him to stick with me."

"100 Modern day Marines vs. 112,000 British soldiers from the American Revolutionary War (1775) : Who wins?

Each group is armed with the weapons and tactics of their day. Marines have unlimited ammo. No air support or anything with vehicles. Brits do not have cannons.  The two groups are dropped a mile from each other, into a relatively open area with some trees and a few buildings.

Feel free to list any relevant web references and articulate your argument.

**edit:** 

the replies to this are fantastic and each side thinks they are undoubtedly correct and vehemently defend their position.  The point of the question is not to determine who would win.  There purposefully isn't enough information in the question to definitively say the Brits win/the Marines win.  

The point of the question is to see how your mind works, to see if you can make some logical assumptions and come to a reasonable conclusion.  Also, when presented with alternate but equally likely logical assumptions, could you possibly change your mind and/or allow for the fact that someone else's position is just as valid.

"My parents house is haunted. I can't remember if I ever posted about it before but I'll just tell the creepiest story.

In high school my boyfriend at the time and I were watching a movie. My parents said he needed to leave by 11 or something which was fine since it was 8 and we just started the movie. I remember having the light on in my room and my tv on obviously. We ended up falling asleep and I woke up to my younger brother knocking at the side of my open door saying ""pink you gotta wake up BF needs to go home"". My tv was off (I don't have a sleep timer or anything set up on it) my bedroom light was off (no one would have shut it off) and my bedside lamp was on. I saw my clock say it was 4 am and I jumped up and woke up my boyfriend telling him he had to leave ASAP (my parents are crazy crazy psycho strict and would've beat the shit out of me and boyfrend had they known he'd been there even at 11:15). I thanked my brother for waking me up and he went back into his room and shut the door. I never heard his door shut though, and his door shut super loud since it was summer and the wood swelled making it hard to close. The next morning I thanked my brother again for waking me up and he was like what? He never left his room. He did say though that he woke up at 5 am and his bedroom light was on and he never slept with his light on as my parents would've freaked out about wasting electricity. Other stuff happened there too but that was the creepiest."

"Absolutly depends what you're looking for.

The West Coast is increasingly becoming a more progressive region with lots going on and some of the best untouched nature on the planet. But that comes with sky high cost of living in some places and other issues 

The east coast and New England have a lot more history and diversity in their major cities. However many Americans find the people their cold/rude in comparison to the rest of the country and while there is some beautiful nature there is a lot more development as well.

The great plains and heartland have the cheapest land (I mean so cheap it will blow your mind) and let's you live a very independent lifestyle if that's your thing. The people are friendly but that's also where you will find most of the Trump voters and you'll be living where it is mostly flat. Plan accordingly.

The South is very diverse, consisting of the Delta, bible belt, deep South, and Florida. There is a whole lot going on down there but they got friendly people, great food, and their own unique culture that even many Americans don't fully understand.

Texas is Texas.

The Great lakes is my home and has many similarities to the Great Plains but is usually a tad more progressive (thinking Minnesota) and has a lot more to see and do in terms of nature. There is a hefty drinking culture and lots of festivals in the summer because everyone is trapped inside all winter.

These are generalizations of course and I'm still leaving out tons, including the entire Southwest. Furthermore each state in each region is going to be different from their neighbors."

"When I was 18 I had moved out into a house with some buddies of mine. I ended up with a basement room, which was fine. There was only one other guy down there besides me, so it was quiet.  About 6-7 months in is when I started noticing odd things about the house: It always stayed ice cold during the hot summer months. It never warmed up when we blasted the heat during the winter months; items were mysteriously going missing and found in random locations; frequent vivid night terrors and the spiders; and everything weird culminating in me seeing something in my hallway in the middle of the night.  The spiders were the most unsettling part actually, even with how disturbing my dreams were while staying in that house. I would wake up to find large black spiders (I mean large) in my room every week or so. And only in my room. No one else had this issue, and they were never seen in any other part of the house. One was right next to my head one morning. I remember that clearly. These spiders were aggressive as well. Another morning I woke up, put my feet on the ground to get out of bed. I looked over to my door to see one of those huge black spiders. Sure enough, it see it turn around and start running at me. My heel won the fight but that scared the shit out of me. Up to that point and since then, I've never seen a spider behave like that toward me.  The night terrors were brutal. Again, up to that point in my life and since then, I had/have not experienced anything like those dreams. I remember one in which I was taking silver necklaces with little ""plates"" on them in which had names engraved. People all around me doing the same thing, and crying a lot. I asked a girl next to me what these were and why they were in the trees. She told me these were people that had died. I remember in my dream looking at a few of the names on ones I'd pulled off a branch. I knew these people personally, and in the dream I was told by the girl how these people died. I woke with the most intense and bottomless feeling of loss and sadness I've ever felt in my life to this day.  One night I got up to pee. I had a small light on in my room that illuminated into the hallway but it was pretty dim. I do my thing, turn off the light and open the door. I was stopped dead in my tracks looking at (and what I discovered years later was called) a ""shadow person"". I didn't know what they were called back when I'd seen this, and at the time the internet wasn't like it is now. There was no way for me to really find out anything about it nor had I heard anything about these ""Things"". But there it was in my hallway standing just beyond my doorway in the darkest part of the hall. It was blacker than the black around it, and around 8 feet tall. Almost touched the ceiling with its head.   I moved out a month later. Weirdest experiences of my life. Glad it's long behind me."

"In family law particularly, people can behave in extreme ways because this is the most emotional flash point in their lives. It usually involves their children or their home, or both. However, clients with character who care about their children, go about divorces in the same way they do the rest of their lives; and they are a pleasure to represent. 

The problem clients… As you practice law longer, you recognize clients that aren’t emotionally functional and do crazy shit. I want to list some comic examples, but once you really understand that these are human beings who are victims of physical and sexual abuse, suffer from debilitating addiction problems, or have serious psychiatric disorders, it loses its panache. The hardest thing to do is look at some ignorant alcoholic 45 year old 250 pound tattooed bully that just beat the shit out of his wife and see that he's really a 10 year little kid that watched his mom get beat up and he never moved on from that. Or some screeching middle aged woman that lights a car on fire but it turns out she's really a little girl that got molested and told her mother and her mother told her she was a liar and never to tell anyone. Or the innocent spouse that never saw that one coming. Now try switching the races. Being a lawyer means getting uncomfortable insight into people’s lives and it usually isn’t very funny.  

From the lawyer’s perspective, he or she is putting their reputation alongside someone going through this. These are red flag clients and our job isn’t to fix all these problems. If they are abusive or display psychotic behavior to their spouses, they will do it to you. Same principal as seeing as how they treat the waiter. They also won’t pay your bill or be satisfied with your legal work. I generally turn these clients away unless I know their family and no one else is going to represent them. But you have to be very heavy handed with them."
"Never settle, and don't rely on someone to change. That's the best advice I can give you.

You can't paint a pretty picture of who they say they want to be or you hope they will be. Likewise, make sure you are good with the bad, because that's the stuff that turns a relationship sour. Making excuses for the bad, because of the good isn't good enough.

On your side always be trying to better who you are. If you want to attract and keep someone who is worthwhile for you to be with for the rest of your life then you better damn sure be good enough for them too. "

"Sorry, this is super long. It happened a few months ago and is still pretty fresh in my mind. 

TD;DR: Employee in a small company thinks that someone above him in seniority being fired equals a promotion and clear shot to the top. He gets ban-happy and becomes a nightmare to the newest hire. 

I'm the owner/operator of a small gas station. My number of staff usually fluctuates between 2-5, depending on if hires are looking for full-time or part-time. At the time I had 3 employees. A worthy piece of information to know is that ""seniority"" only really shows in the order peoples' names are written on the hours payable sheet of paper. This employee, let's say his name is Bob, was the most recent hire and therefore #3 on the list. Technically, including me, he's #4 in seniority at the place and at the bottom. He's only been there 2 months and is 19 years old. 

Some stuff came to light about the employee we would consider #3 in seniority that meant I needed to relieve him of his position. On the day I was trying to get all of that done, Bob was hanging out a little bit too early before his shift. I told him he needed to leave for about a half-hour or so and when he got worried it had to do with him I told him that So-and-So was going to be dismissed and was on his way down knowing I needed to talk with him. So Bob heads off for a bit and comes back. Has questions I can't answer, all that jazz. 

Now that there are shifts cleared up on the schedule, I go through the usual motion of asking my other employees if they're looking for a change, more hours, etc. My Assistant Manager is happy with her 40 hours working the weekday morning shifts. So I ask Bob if he's looking for more hours and perhaps on different days. He was doing the weekend morning shifts and then Monday/Tuesday evening (the station is so small that only one person works at a time). He was happy to take one extra shift to get the full 40 hours and went to straight evening shifts. 

Since I had to get the now-dismissed employee his last check ASAP, I took the hour sheet to the accountant and then set up a new one. That employee's name wasn't on this one, and Bob's name was underneath Assistant Manager. It's like this lightbulb goes off and he's like ""Does this mean I'm #3 in the company?"" 

I tell him technically yes. 

Going forward, his behaviour and attitude toward the workplace begins to change. It was spring so I was looking to do some painting and whatnot around the place to get it ready for the summer tourist season. He jumped on every opportunity to help often without care for compensation. I could force a free coffee into his hands once in a while but that was about it. He started bringing stuff from home to use at work, like locks and ladders. He was eager to start each shift. He would come down on the day our bigger orders come in and help put them away. He said he could see himself working his way up through the company to eventually become someone in my position if for whatever reason I someday left. 

This was awesome. However, after a while, the good worker behaviour seemed to lend him to think that us three co-workers were friends and that the workplace was a hangout zone. He would get up in the morning and come straight down. He'd squat in the corner and chat with whoever was on shift between customer transactions. When he'd call me, it was less and less about work stuff and more personal. Building off that, I apparently needed to know every detail about his personal life and every past instance that contributed to making him the person he was. It was tiresome and if I'd noticed the slow change in tide I would've nipped it in the bud. But I tolerated more and more like a boiled frog so that I could get the good and helpful behaviour while I was still in search of a new employee. I couldn't afford for him to get offended and quit on me, especially since I had a week-long trip coming up that I needed all hands on deck for. 

I did find a new hire, we'll call her Jane. She's a friend of Bob's that just lost a job elsewhere. I knew who she was because she'd worked before at a grocery store with similar tills to ours. I figured it wouldn't take much to train her and I was always happy with her service whenever she was my cashier. 

One thing to know about Bob is that he was cycling through girlfriends at the time. When he first started he was with a girl that he'd dated for a year. Then they broke up and Bob started to secretly date her best friend. Best friend decided not to do that to the first ex-girlfriend so dumped Bob. Bob was trying to hook up with an ex from a nearby city. Then he was pursuing a girl about his age who tended to see half the town, if you catch my meaning. He was also sort of interested in Jane. Basically he just put as many hooks in the water to see which fish he might catch. 

When Jane started, it was handy that Bob was always around. It meant she didn't have to call me when she ran into something she was unfamiliar with, since Bob was right there to help. However, it didn't take long for the tide to turn. Bob would tell Jane that maybe it was time she ""gave him that date they always talked about"". He would get pouty when she insisted that she wanted to stay friends. I would tell him that I didn't want him bugging her for a date since it made things awkward and Jane wasn't comfortable with him since he was always around. 

At the same time this was all happening, Bob was starting to be an ass to customers. He got into an argument with one customer over the price of engine oil. My division's head office will often push through price changes without so much as sending me an email to let me know to change signage. A customer noticed some stuff went up a dollar higher than it was on the tag and him and Bob got ignorant with each other. Bob called me to ask what to do and I said charge the price on the tag until I could get in to change the tags. Bob told the guy not to ever come back after selling him the oil. 

He also asks if it's possible to ban a couple regular customers because they smell bad. I say absolutely not. 

The drama with Bob's two ex-girlfriends who were best friends comes into play here. They were both underage and smoked, and Bob would buy them cigarettes (I requested that he do it at a different store and to not tell me about that kind of shit because I didn't want to know about his illegal activities). The girls knew it was illegal to sell to minors so they would try to get their friends to come in and get Bob to sell them cigarettes so that they could get him in trouble. If they legitimately needed cigarettes, they would send in an of-age friend, and then the girls would wave their packs of smokes at Bob as some kind of ""haha got you"" thing that 16 years olds would find clever. In trying to plug up that kind of behaviour, we started refusing to sell to known booters of minors. At the same time, Best Friend that Bob Dated Behind First Ex's Back told her dad about ""Bob selling cigarettes to her"". Dad didn't like this and called me saying he either wanted Bob fired or he was going to report me to the authorities. Of course I can't just fire someone willy-nilly especially when I know he hasn't been selling to minors by watching cameras so I held my ground and called his bluff. He called the appropriate agency that deals with that stuff and they conducted an investigation that went nowhere because their mystery shoppers couldn't nail Bob on something he didn't do while working behind the till. 

Finally the time came for me to go away for a week. I was so ready to shed all the drama for a while and enjoy myself on a van trip with my best friend to meet up with a couple other friends that attend uni 1000 km away. After only a day all the insanity caught up with me and I decided it was time to bring an end to it. We weren't doing anything wrong, so all the 'legal' drama would clear up on its own in time. But everyone getting drug into Bob's personal life needed to end. It was putting a strain on everybody and making the workplace a definitely-not-fun place to be. There's only so long that someone can put up acting like a therapist to a neurotic kid that, even when you give advice, does the exact opposite of what you recommend. Basically he just wanted someone to tell him he was in the right if he'd wronged somebody, since he was burning so many bridges at this point. Roommates, best friends, family. . .you name it. 

I came home. Within 15 minutes Bob found out I was home and started texting me. I didn't reply. Jane texted me saying she needed to talk to me about some stuff that happened while I was gone. Assistant Manager, normally a very quiet person, also wanted to talk about some stuff Bob did while I was gone and in general just wanted to make it clear how embarrassing of a workplace the station was lately with all the bullshit. I heard Jane out (apparently Bob tried to tell her how to do some stuff ""properly"" and she reminded him that he wasn't her boss. He called her a bitch and told her to go fuck herself. Perhaps still a little bitter that he never got that date?).

second time, which was the day after, him and i were having really rough sex which in turn made me scream super loud and disturbing the peace of the building. turns out the people studying in the study rooms two rooms down could hear us and started banging on everyone's door to try to find out who it was that was making all the noise. let's say from that point on, biting a pillow became a routine item for us.

"Pasted from earlier but very relevant too.

My best friend is the sweetest guy you'll ever meet and truly an amazing person. If you spend a day with him you'll want him in your life. 

I myself have a shit personality compared to him, no doubt. I have way more issues with my confidence, my life is a mess and I have anger issues. He on the other hand, is a genius at school, is by far the most kind and selfless guy I know, and if it weren't for one thing he'd be swarmed by all the ladies.

This thing, he has a condition that causes him obesity and heavy acne. He's battled it all of his life, and nothing has worked.

Want to know what's fucked up?? He's never had a second date and most times the first ones were out of courtesy or misunderstanding (or he feels that way, but more than one girl has admitted it to him). All this while a prick like me has all the chances I could want just because I'm good looking.

Most people say that he's just been unlucky and has met only shitty people, but the horrible thing is that I have known and even dated some of these girls, and they are excellent people who have been good to me. They're just too superficial to look past his appearance, they just can't.

I have no doubt that as time goes by the people around him will become more mature and girls will end up fighting for him, but this one stupid thing has caused him so much loneliness and self image issues. 

The world is unfair in everything, including romance, and some people will have it tougher than others. 

I think it's important that we keep this in mind when suggesting to people to work on themselves when they're lonely, because in a way it's like telling them ""yeah you're broken go fix yourself before anyone will love you"". And sometimes they're more than fine, and it's the world around them what is broken and needs to be fixed.

TL;DR: Learn to love yourself as you are before anything else. Working on yourself is never a bad thing and will make you more appealing to others, but maybe you're just having bad luck. "
"&gt;Stop trying so hard. [...] The saying ""it comes when you least expect it"" was very true in my experience.

Yeah people kept telling me that and I believed them. Took me three years to realize the mistake.

It ain't gonna happen if you aren't in a position to meet girls in the first place (e.g. IT study &amp; not going out other than to hacker conferences) and the train station doesn't count. You aren't going to randomly meet one in the street and mutually go ""tag, you're it"". Even actively looking it took some time. Oh and dating sites like okcupid only work in theory; in practice many guys want a girl more than a girl wants a guy and thus girls are fewer and more overloaded with messages. No fun for either party. The stories I've heard about meeting nice people there are few and far between (though sure they're there, odds are just slim)."

He finally asked me why I came if I wasn't remotely interested and I explained that his company kept calling me to get my butt in this seat and even though I told the phone person I wasn't interested in a time share that they kept calling so if they were going to waste my time then I decided to waste his.

"Omg finally one I can answer!

There's the typical cleaning out the accounts and running, claiming the children first on taxes so the other party can't, claiming the other party as a dependent so they can't file separately, stuff like that.

Then there was this one case.

My client fled the home with her baby after an incident of domestic violence. In my state, both parents have full rights to the children unless a custody order in place. In other words, whoever has the kid, gets the kid. Police will not intervene where one spouse is withholding a child from the other spouse if there are no orders in place.

Well my client had the child for two weeks at her new place when H showed up demanding the child. She refused. He called the police. The responding officer was a family friend of both, but originally a friend of H. This PO shows up and decides to try to mediate the conflict. The PO tells my client something along the lines of ""let him hug his son goodbye and he will leave peacefully."" My client was hesitant, but agreed. H took the kid and exclaimed ""he's mine now!"" And ran to his car with the baby. No supplies, no clothes, nothing. The PO claimed he had no idea what was happening (yeah right). And since no orders were in place, there was nothing my client could do.

While we were trying to track him down, we got an order returning the child to my client's possession. He suddenly contacted my client saying he was at a hotel in the area and if she wanted her son back, she  could if she came over and slept with him. We sent the police."

"I heartfully agree. The San Junipero-episode hits hard at an existential level.

Because there's death; the days we live, the relationships we build and the things we do actually matter. But Kelly changes her mind, and chooses for a life where there's an endless number of days to live. However, what the hell does it all matter anymore? That nasty club scene in Junipero shows exactly what life is when it never ends and nothing is real. People will go and do the strangest things just to feel something, when ultimately, since all is fake, they can't. That's where Kelly and Yorkies will end. In an eternal state of being where nothing matters and everything is fake. That's not heaven, it's hell."

We all sat in the room and cried and sat there, like 15 of us in the ICU room at 2 am. Wasn't supposed to be more than 2 family in the room at the time, but I guess they made exceptions when it was this cut and dry. 

Except she made it through the night, and the next night and the night after...she went for 10 weeks in that hospital getting better and stronger, visited her every week even though for the first 7 weeks she was literally asleep the entire time, maybe awake for like an hour a day. Last 3 weeks she woke up, off the ventilator, training to breath again. . .slowly started talking, always telling me to take a train home (NYC hospital, we didn't live in the city) and go have a social life. 

At the ten week mark she was living pretty normally within the hospital, out of the ICU, talking and breathing normal. She was transferred to a nursing home near our house for some rehab. We were all supposed to see her that night. I had worked really long hours that day and texted her ""hey mom I'm really tired, I have a much lighter night tomorrow night I'll come see you and we will hang out"" - something to that affect. . .she died that night, sometime in the middle of the night had a heart attack and passed on, never got to talk or text her again.

My vaginal walls are super small. Like to the point where anything slightly thicker than an average penis is stretching me. I also had surgery on my abdomen a while back and caused temporary incontinence, so i had to do kegels every day for like a year.

Sigh... I can squeeze my vaginal walls so tightly that I can essentially shoot things out of my hooha.

"My mom did this without my knowledge.

"When I was in college, a friend of mine met a guy that I had dated briefly. We were never serious, but it was a reliable hook up if either of us ever wanted that, so we kept contact after the relationship burned out, plus we had mutual friends so we saw each other on the regular. One of the main issues I had with the relationship was that he had serious anger issues. He was kicked out of one apartment for fighting. He got blackballed from a fraternity for similar behavior. He was just not a good person. 

Anyway, he fell madly in love with her the second they met. I remember him being like ""Why haven't you introduced me to this girl before??? She's beautiful!"" 

Me and one other friend warned her not to get involved with him because of his anger issues. I thought he was trouble to begin with, but she also had anger issues so the relationship was a disaster waiting to happen. She wasn't violent like he was, but she had a terrible temper. She ignored me and dated him anyway, so I decided to tell her about my history with him because if she found it out later from someone else, she would've never forgiven me for keeping that from her. 

Well, he was *pissed* about it. He evidently wasn't planning on telling her that he'd slept with one of her best friends. I don't know if that was the only issue (she probably also told him that we tried to prevent them from dating), but she pulled away not long after that. I heard from her a few times while they dated, but she was pretty cold to me. I found out later that he actively avoided us after that and told her not to invite us to events and tried to get other people to not invite us either. 

They dated for probably 6 or 7 months and it was a train wreck. The police were called out to his place on a couple of occasions because their fights got too loud. I think the break up was one of them throwing the other's belongings out on the lawn. We've seen each other a handful of times since then but the relationship was never the same. I'm still bitter that she pulled away because a boy told her to, and who knows how she feels about me but she hasn't made a big effort and we aren't anywhere near as close. 

Strangely, she ended up marrying someone who is the complete opposite. Instead of breaking her car windows after a fight, her husband calls his mom and cries that his wife is being mean to him and get her on his side. Her MIL has actually called her and told her to stop being mean to her son. I mean, she probably *is* being mean to him, but it's an odd dynamic.

"Long time ago, like 20 years maybe (google if you're interested), there was this really awesome wrestler. Swedish guy, think his name was Johansson or something like that. 

He was the second greatest wrestler in the world. Really good. Defeated everyone the world threw at him. Except for one guy off course, the number one guy in the world. This Russian brute named Karelin I think it was. Throughout his entire fucking career, the Swedish guy beat hundreds of guys but never ever scored a single point against Karelin. 

Then finally, i don't know if it was the olympics or the WC but Karelin was injured and not as super amazing as he'd always been before. Everyone thought maybe this time guy number two can challenge guy number one. The Swede managed to score one single point with a roll and was then defeated again.

So in his entire career he never ever had the slightest chance to be number one. He'd always be number two and he probably knew it. Wonder how that feels. 

(At least that's the story a wrestler guy told me, not sure if it is 100% true)"

"During a summer semester at university, I woke up early one morning to get ready to help with an orientation visit. I had fetched my hygiene bag and was walking down to the dorm's bathroom showers when I noticed that the bathroom door was left wide open. I peaked in to find all four showers running at once, emitting a thick, humid cloud that made it hard to see through. That there were only twelve of us left in the dorm made it easy to get used to one another's routines, so I knew that I was the only one who should be in here showering at 6:10 AM, much less with all the showers on full blast. 

I called inside to see who was inside; only the sound of spraying water answered back. I mumbled to myself that I didn't have time for this as I sleepily shuffled one, two, three steps into the sweltering fog when I saw something that got me awake. There, on the floor, was a red footprint. Two bloody-red footprints. Three, no, four freshly wet, bloody-red footprints. Peering through the tropical mist, I could make out a trail of crimson foot stomps leading from a shower to where I was standing, staining the tile floor past the sinks, and towards the wall with the window...which had been forced open.

I didn't stick around for a second look, since as the black guy, I knew I'd die first; I dropped my bag as I hightailed it back to my room, slammed and bolted the door, and called the front desk. An RA was down there in minutes, followed shortly by a cop. Yes, the footprints were from blood, but they couldn't find a blood trail leading to the shower (only leaving) or anything sharp in the bathroom that would've accidentally caused such bleeding; likelihood was that the person had cut themselves with something they brought in the shower stall? And all other residents on the floor were accounted for (with the soles of their feet in good condition), and since we all had electronic access to the dorm, none of us needed to go through the window. The only thing they could reason was that whoever had sneaked in, they must have heard me coming down the hallway, missing their crazy escape by seconds.

I noped the fuck out of going back to the showers that morning and just threw my university shirt on to get to the student orientation, which was uneventful that day minus parents/students' questions about dorm life. That was just one of several stranger things that weird summer."

Far as I knew they'd never really had anything to do with each other. I rarely saw that branch of the family. She was my mums sister and lived elsewhere but I never questioned it. It was just something that was. A couple of weeks later I started asking questions. Firstly my sister, she didn't know anything. Next my other aunt and she warned me not to mess in old history. 

Eventually I got the story in pieces. Turns out that my aunt and my dad had a pretty nice affair in the 60's. They were on the verge of running away together and there was a massive family scandal that was hushed up and my aunt moved away, before that they were as close as sisters ever could be"

But I wasn't trying to say that it's the school's job and not parents'. I simply answered the question, since no one in my life, school or parents, taught me the first thing about handling finances. That being said, I write plenty of checks now and I think I'm doing just fine. "

"In all fairness, it can make the other party feel bad if they are asking you to do something they think is fun and want you to have fun with them. But, the reason you don't want to enjoy their fun with them is because you don't want to - which can read as ""I don't want to *with you*"".

"Felony probation officer here so I know a thing or two about this.

I'll state this up front; if you're one of my offenders and it comes to employment you get three choices - you can work for yourself and get a paycheck, you can go on disability/retirement if you're eligible, or you can do community service work until you're one of those other two choices, essentially working for the government for free. We have a huge push to get offenders employed in my state. Employment breeds stability, gives the taxpayers a break, and reduces recidivism - so it's good for everyone.

Now, to answer the where can a felon work: lots of different places. In the areas I work, the default job seems to be factory labor. When you first come to me as a felon, we're starting from scratch, so I really want you working somewhere doing something even if it isn't the best job that there ever was. Work builds confidence, and once you start we can build from there.

The offices I work in also offer job prep classes and host job fairs for employers that don't really care about the felon label (yes, that really happens). Need a GED to improve your situation? I'm hooking you up with classes to do that and I'm going to make it a mandatory order that you do and I will follow up regularly. Have a crappy job and want something better? I'm going to encourage you to keep working the current crappy job, keeping as a good as an attitude as you can about it, while you look for another job to replace it.

You would also be suprised how many places don't even do rudimentary background checks. I talk to some employers and they have no idea that Joe Offender is a felon or has a probation officer. It's even better when they tell me that it doesn't matter as they can't afford to loose them.

Best case scenario that I've seen is contracting jobs for felons. HVAC, construction, demolition, scrapping, etc. I've had dozens of felons that make quite a bit more than I do in income and even had a few millionaires in my time. It's really more about attitude of the offender than anything else. I do tell my offenders when they are starting out or getting frustrated that due to their past mistakes that they have to accept that they are going to get a few more ""no's"" than the average person, but that they have to compensate by working harder and smarter than others that don't have those limitations.

So I was bullied a lot, grades 8-9 were also pretty rough. At the start of the school year grade 10 I was being picked on as usual and something clicked. I realised I could fight back, it was like a switch flipped. I chased a kid who had been bullying me for years across the school. I watched him yell at his friends to back him up and the realization on his face that no one cared and everyone wanted to watch the fight instead of intervene.
I beat the shit out of him in front of the entire grade 10 class until I was pulled off of him, It was righteous. 

It ruined him, he never spoke to me again, and everyone quit picking on me. I feel a little bit bad now that I've matured."

We had a handcuff-terrorist party at my roommate's girlfriend's house for her birthday. It was basically pairs of people, dressed as terrorists, sharing fifths between eachother while ziptied together. Finish the drink, you're free.

Many things went wrong.

I got stabbed in the face right below my eye when my friend tried to cut off the ziptie with a knife

We started a bonfire in the backyard using lawn furniture and lighter fluid

We splattered her roommates' expensive shampoo all over the fridge, and used hairspray and a lighter to make a torch

We were playing WrestleMania 21 on the tv at max volume the whole time.

Her roommate called her dad, who came and tried to kick everyone out. He grabbed and pushed my roommate, which led to my friends tackling the dad. As the dad was screaming at my friend, he yelled at the dad ""I DO COKE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER""

My roommate's girlfriend was kicked out of the house

"I've always jokingly equated it to that, but it's shockingly accurate. And initially I thought I was going to be in the ""try it and leave"" group. In fact I was for a bit.

I played to level 4 with my one friend, and it was ok at the time but it was unlike anything I've ever played; the control scheme was foreign, the games were slower than I'm used to (in terms of multiplayer games), and it was the first time where I played a game based around cooldowns. I thought it was ok at best, and then didn't touch it for a few months. 

But then spring break rolled around and not having a car or money and being far from home I decided to give it another shot, aided by the fact that my friend was egging me on. And this time my friend got both me and my roommate into it. Also, that weekend URF came out for the second time ever so we just got to have a blast for like a week straight. 

Now I'm one of those players that's constantly reading patch notes, watching competitive games (#FOXWIN), theorycrafting builds, etc.  And I legitimately feel something missing if I go a substantial amount of time without playing. It's not in a bad way, it's just I wholeheartedly enjoy playing the game and I want to get back to playing some wacky shit with my friends in a normal. Or, at least I think it's not in a bad way...

For some stupid reason I thought it would make me walk on water like Jesus. I could have drowned and I don't think anyone would have noticed for a long time, and the pool wasn't even very busy! Lifeguards really need to be extremely vigilant. Also pools should really have a limit on people imo. Not just because of the drowning risk, but that many people in one place is pretty fucking gross, shedding skin and hair and piss etc. I haven't swam in a public pool in years."

Each time we answered the crowd of people would ""OOOOOHHHH"", like a fucking rap battle or something. Anyway, about 20 questions down, he got me with one - I blanked.

I couldn't believe what atrocities took place there. I was wracked with guilt and shock. I hated myself for being Ignorant and not really knowing too much about the 'holocaust'. 

I read and read as much as I could and now I can honestly say that I hold and respect others values and beliefs and not pre judging or pouring scorn on them.

"Fuck it. No throwaway. 

I worked at a mid sized paint manufacturer as a batch maker, all around laborer. I had previous experience in building maintenance so when the maintenance guy got really sick and had to miss a few months I stepped in to take care of business. His work area was separated from the rest of the plant to avoid explosions. (sparks&amp; fire + paint ingredients= death) I had to do a lot of metal fabrication and build a lot of things from scratch. His whole work area was a nightmare, finding parts and tools was really difficult. 

A few weeks into my new job I was searching for some pipe fittings. I dug through bins and boxes. I found old uncashed paychecks and some porn, nothing too crazy. Then I saw a box under a work bench. It was black plastic box like a tackle box. I pulled it out from it's hiding place and popped it open. To my surprise I found an old mini DV camcorder with black tape covering everything except the lense and buttons along with 25+ mini DV tapes. I am a curious person and this was intriguing as all hell. I slipped into his office, plugged the camera into a TV he had, popped in a tape and immediately dropped my jaw to the floor. It was obvious the camera was hidden in a bathroom closet. A woman was showering behind a curtain and then she was just out of the shower, naked, toweling off completely oblivious to the show she was on. I was a little baffled, it seemed my co worker filmed his wife secretly. 

Here's where my regret kicks in. Over the next week I would try a new tape every time I had a free moment. Most were his wife, some were what I can only assume to be prostitutes changing very ovbiously for the camera. 

Then I popped in the tape that shook me to my core. Alright, that's a bit much, but it was still weird. It started the same as most. A high POV from a closet facing a bathroom mirror. The wife was naked, doing her hair in the mirror when a young woman walked in, late teens or early twenties, blonde and attractive complaining about some family event I can't remember the details of anymore. The girl then stripped down and got into the shower. This is a different twist, filming your wife is one thing, but your daughter? That's a whole different beast. The wife was still at the mirror when the daughter got out of the shower. The daughter then grabbed her mother's breasts from behind and commented on the look. What the fuck? Then the younger daughter came in...  WHAT THE FUCK? Now I'm not great at guessing age but I don't know if she'd be ""legal"" she also stripped down, her sister and mother commented on her breasts with touching and weighing. WHAT. THE. FUCK!?!? They goofed around in the mirror, touching, giggling, light spanking. They did their hair and makeup and left. Written on the tape: ""Great""

I didn't know what to do so I put everything back where I found it and thought about what to do. I decided I would show the box to my manager and say I hadn't watched the tapes but it looked fishy. When I went back to work the next day the box and tapes were gone. I couldn't be around that guy anymore after that. He gave me the creeps something feirce, I warned the female employees to watch out in their locker room. They already knew he was a creep, just not to the extent I had seen.

"I was homeless short term (about two months?) and was fortunate enough to have a vehicle and a minimum wage job, so my experience wasn't nearly as bad as some. The scariest part for me was being an 18 year old who didn't know her way around too well and trying to find a semi safe place to park for the night. I'd wake up every few hours to go move my car to another place to try to avoid suspicious vehicle reports. The scariest moment was about 2:00am in a Lowe's parking lot. I woke up to someone parked in front of me with their brights  shining right into my windshield. I didn't know what to do, so I just huddled further down and pulled a blanket over my head and hoped for the best. Thankfully nothing came of it. Since then I've realized that a lot of the places I stayed were in really bad areas. I'm extremely lucky nothing happened to me. I'd say next to that the scariest part was trying to stay clean enough to work/go to school. I was always fearful someone would come into one of the public restrooms while I was washing my hair in the sink. It happened once - I was cornered by a couple of women who came in and wanted to know why I was washing my hair, if I was alone, etc.. I had to literally duck between them to get out. Ran like mad with my head full of hand soap. I don't know if they were well intentioned or not, but it was terrifying. Not good times. "

"This is great advice. If you don't go out when invited you WILL eventually stop being invited. It is so easy and comfortable to fall into solitude. This is true at any age and regardless of whether you are in a relationship or not. 

I'll add a couple of other things: the friends I have who are still single have a checklist of perfection in their head. The ones who are in happy relationships have kept an open mind. 

If you day dream about your friend falling for you, it's sometimes because she/he already knows you well and your idea of a healthy relationship is someone who loves you for who you are. That is correct. So get to know others and let them see who you are. Why not broaden that?

The opposite sex is just as confused as you are, and just as insecure.

You will occasionally have to put yourself out there. Regardless of gender. My wife of 11 years is the first person I physically ran after in my life - to stop her from leaving - We were randomly chatting at a bar and she left with her sister. I caught up with her in the car park and changed my life. Two years later she proposed to me.

I will point out that the reason I had to run is that I was insecure enough not to push for her number in the first place. Doesn't matter how it happens. To this day I don't know what came over me.

So, yeah. Say yes. Don't fixate on any one person until it's reciprocated in some way. Just be present, and good things will happen.

"Fuck

it's not creepy as it is disturbing .they are creepy, but they disturbed me more then they creeped me out.


I've seen many shit on the Internet that has made me cringe, laugh, feel sick etc .

However there are 2 that made me cry.

The second of which is the worst thing I have ever seen , something I will never unsee, and has made me paranoid, and protective ever since .

1. There was a video on youtube and Facebook around 6 years ago, in the Russian dominated section of youtube, of little kids putting gasoline on a puppy, and then setting it on fire . The dog ran around squealing and crying out in pain while these kids no older then 4-7 were laughing at the dog.

Though many claimed it was Russian, I spoke arabic and I am kuwaiti , and the kids in the video were clearly speaking kuwaiti Arabic (which is irrelevant but it kinda bugged me that it was kids from my birth country doing this)

Before they set the dog on fire they were even saying don't touch it, it's a dog, it's dirty etc.

That and other things made me realize because we believe dogs tongue are dirty, they are treated less then living creatures,  this is me going off topic but I really want everyone who comes from a similar background as me to think real hard about what they teach to their younger siblings/kids. You need to make them understand that all life is precious, no matter what it is, and no animal should be subject to this.


For everyone to understand how bad dogs are treated in kuwait.... Police officers and soldiers kill them for training....


I'll keep #2 brief because it disturbs me

I legit cried tears for the first time in years when I saw her twitching like that. Idk what was going through her mind.


Saw that same video a year ago and 3 months ago resurface.


Sometimes I hate the Internet, and I hate my fascination of going to weird parts of the Internet seeing people's deaths, suicides, and body parts cut off. 

 I kinda stopped visiting then because after seeing the video of the girl popping up again just fucked me up. 

Edit- the video was from Brazil  it's 7 am so ima go to bed .


Super edit : (I've been awake for over 36 hours) 

So the comments got a bit heated, and I want to just say some quick things.

We're all human beings born and raised in different nations with different ideologies, beliefs, and cultural something something  when one person voiced their opinion that you dislike or disagree with, that does not  mean you ignore them completely when they begin responding to you and trying to have an actual conversation (fuck you dafranco &lt;3)  speak to them, figure out their viewpoint and their reasons and offer your own.

I would also like to mention that there is no good or bad nation, I was born in kuwait, I have relatives from kuwait and Saudi Arabia and Iraq, i immigrated to Canada when I was 5 years old. Each nation has its good and bad, some more then others, however
Cat organizing ( fucking auto correct)everyone hurts.

I hear people saying that Kuwaitis and Iraqis should do this, they should ""speak up""  they should do this and do that, in reality, there are people that do, you just don't pay attention to those nations enough to see it .

I speak out a lot, my grandfather also spoke out about the Kuwaiti government.... Guess what happened...? He was stripped of his citizenship and so were all of his children and their children, and their children's children, I want everyone to take a minute and google Kuwaiti citizenship and see how important it is, and why kuwait has one of the highest suicide rates in the world (it's relevant)

My cousin... Raped, tortured, abused, mentally and physically(2011)died not even a year ago. His heart and lungs were basically black. Note : after 4 years, when he finally found a transplants while his chances went from 2% chance of living to 50% he died less then a week before the surgery (fucking bs eh) 

That happened to him because he spoke out, he has 2 children, he dint even meet 1 of them... The other was asking his father why he's not answering him (brain dead)

People speak out, they suffer the consequences..... 

I can say I hate the United States, that nation is shit and this and that, I have had personal loss thanks to the UK and the U.S. I've lost more then 50ish? Relatives when the U.S. And some of its ally's decided to attack my mothers nation and massacre hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. I know that's not the whole United States.... Don't label people... Imagine being labeled as a killer or something else because of where you were born...

It hurts, it hurts when I'm accused of being a terrorist, or homophobe, or a sexist, because of where I was born or other reasons, because that's not me at all. I'm glad I was raised in canada, I really am, but it hurts when a few of the population don't see me as 1 of them. 


There's a divide, we are divided as people, but if someone says something that you disagree with, don't fight them, enlighten them.

To the guy everyone decided to bash on, hmu bro:D incompletely understand how you saw red and you posted with rage, when I saw the burning dog I was like fuck all kuwait, anger does things to us, it brings out a side we may not all like. I understand and it's not biggie &lt;3 as long as you keep an open mind.


To everyone else, thanks for voicing your opinions , dont fight:D have a Vinto/leban or grab a beer bruuuuh:D"

About 8 or so years ago, my friend and i were walking through the woods on the mountain behind my family's summer camp in NH. We were 15ish. The woods are pretty thick in this area, we weren't on a trail or anything, just putzing around in The woods like idiots as only teenagers can do, but I have a ridiculously good sense of direction and can always get home in these woods so we weren't concerned. Anyway, it starts to get a bit dusky so we head home which I believe I estimated to be about a half hour walk down the steep-ass slope of the woods. Walking down a super steep incline like that is a hell of a workout on your calves and at this point we are about 10 minutes walk back from camp, so we stopped on a big rock for a second to rest, and as we're doing that I hear movement to our left, leaves rustling and sticks cracking and such (the ground here is literally always covered in a thick layer of fallen leaves all year round until it's under snow). We sit very quietly for a minute, hoping To see a deer or something, when out from behind this huge upended tree root structure maybe like 30 feet from us or so (not sure on exact footage but I'd say like a yellow school bus length's away) is the biggest fucking COYOTE I've ever seen in my life. It was absolutely gigantic. Like larger than a great dane. So we are completely terrified thinking we are about to be eaten by a pack of coyotes. It takes a few steps, not toward us but sort of just straight ahead, which is to our right, and its looking at us and sniffing its nose up. We are just frozen in place in fear and uncertainty not at all sure of what to do.. when this thing stands. up. on. its. hind. legs.

IT'S STANDING.

I can not possibly convey to you the wrongness of this sight. It was just this intense feeling of something so un-natural. It immediately turned my blood to ice. It stands there for about 3 seconds or so just looking at us all hunched at weird angle before our bodies unfreeze enough to run as fast as humanly possible down this incredibly steep leaf covered mountainside to my camp. We made it home in less than 5 minutes. No sign of that thing, and I have not gone back into the woods since.

 It was the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in my life, and he saw it just as clear as me. We only spoke about it one time again after that weekend. I don't even know how to explain how this thing made me feel... like everything in that moment in time was wrong and broken and nothing would ever be ok again. It makes my eyes water and covers me in goosebumps just thinking back on it.


I'm well aware of how unbelievable this is, which is why I don't talk about it. But I know what I saw."

"It should be noted that the redoubtable Tim Rice (Andrew L-W's longtime musical partner) wrote the book for the show, was co-lyricist, and along with Benny and Bjorn shares co-creator status for both London and Broadway productions of *Chess*.  BTW, it was announced two weeks ago that the show will be revived on Broadway, with a new book, some time in 2018. It will be directed by Michael Mayer, who won a Tony for *Spring Awakening* - so it should be good. 

Side story: remarkably, I was actually *in* Bangkok for three weeks during the spring of '84, exactly when *One Night in Bangkok* hit the Asian pop charts like a pile-driver.

Although the song was at best only marginally flattering to their capital, Thais enthusiastically adopted this unexpected bit of Western attention and musical love/hate as a kind of unofficial city anthem; it quickly became ubiquitous. 

Within a week, every blessed pushcart full of bootleg cassettes - and there seemed to be one on every corner - was blasting out either *ONIB*, or *Careless Whispers*. (Wham! was just then touring China, which was still being shielded from most ""immoral"" Western social influences. So the tour was seen as a big East/West cultural breakthrough, and it triggered a sudden, though short-lived, pan-Asian fascination with the pop duo.) Restaurants and bars - indeed any place that desired to attract tourists - would play both tracks incessantly; cover bands would repeat them every second set, and they were *absolutely* inescapable at karaoke bars - each sung many times over in the course of a night, in both English and Thai.

Even on experienced and sophisticated travellers, the royal city of Krung Thep almost always makes a *very* strong impression, and my visit there was basically my first trip anywhere off the Canadian prairies. So for me, Bangkok was truly a double scoop of the strange and exotic. And even at the age of thirty, it knocked me right out of my white-bread, 2%-milk socks. 

Because of the overwhelming emotional reaction I had to my eye-opening host, and to its unofficial theme song playing in the background almost everywhere I went,  in my memory today *ONIB* remains inextricably and powerfully linked in an almost *visceral* way to my first experience of Bangkok itself.

In fact, fully 33 years later, be it in a mall elevator or dentist's office, even upon hearing just a few phrases of a plain-vanilla orchestral cover, I will instantly be transported back to The City of Angels: the hot, humid nights I spent wandering monsoon-wetted streets, full of brilliant neon and chattering crowds; Mekhong whiskey like liquid punishment, washed down with icy Singha beer; the background sulfur stink of canal water, overlaid with the bewitching, tropical garden scents of jasmine and gardenia; the temples, awash in coloured mirror tile and glittering  in the sun's glare; kicking around a soccer ball in a dusty park, with a bunch of laughing teenage monks whose shaved heads sparkled with sweat; following my nose to the food stalls, the aromas of frying shallots, chilies, mint and basil pointing the way as clearly as any posted signage might; the searingly exquisite and complex flavours of authentic *pad thai*; and the tongue-blessings of sweet coconut rice with mango, spooned from an eggshell-thin, chased silver cup.

I've been back several times since then, and on each trip I have gathered many different impressions of that magnificent, bewildering, ever-galloping city, and of its alternately maddening and beguiling people. But my first and most lasting impression of both is almost perfectly summed up by *One Night in Bangkok*'s own lyrics: ""Not much lies between despair and ecstasy"". *That,* to my mind, is truly the essence of the city."

"Congrats. You got a whole new throwaway for this one, because I don't even want this attached to my usual alt account. I'll keep the details minimum but I'm kind of interested in telling this story because I've literally no one to talk to about it, not even him.

I was in my early teens. I was at the beach with much of my extended family. We were largely left to our own devices. 

My cousin was not yet 18, I remember his age specifically because he couldn't buy cigarettes yet. 

Jokes about sex turned into a discussion about sex. I asked him a lot of questions and he gave me a lot of answers. This went on for awhile, like over several days, until the topic of masturbation came up. 

One thing lead to another and we were talking about penises, specifically size. I remember being worried about mine being small and he told me I could show him and he'd tell me. So I did. 

I wasn't hard at the time, and he said it looked normal and if I was a grower like he was I was in good shape. I didn't know what a grower was, so he explained but I still didn't really understand. 

He asked if he could show me. I said okay, and he demonstrated the gap in size from flaccid to erect, and I ended up doing the same to mine. We compared. He showed me different techniques to masturbate, and we ended up doing them on each other. 

This happened next summer too, and the summer after that. Never more than handjobs and mutual masturbation. The fourth summer my grandparents sold the house and we only went down the shore for a day at at time here and there. 

My cousin and I don't talk about it. I'm in my late 20s now. Honestly? I enjoyed it. I learned at lot. I don't feel like he took advantage of me, and the second year I was the one who initiated our activities, and he was the one who was a little hesitant at first.

I chalk it up to young sexual experimentation. Its like it never happened, and my cousin and I get along just fine. "

"The last commercial plane crash in the United States happened in my home town. The crash is incredibly close to my house and I live directly on the flight path. I’m certain that if it was in the air just a few seconds more or if something went slightly differently in the cockpit it could’ve hit my house. Flight 3407 killed all 49 people on board as well as 1 person on the ground. It landed directly on one house in a neighborhood, the fire hall is basically across the street from the crash. 2 other people were in the house but had managed to get out. It was a father, mother and a daughter. I believe the daughter climbed through a basement window. The father was the one who died from the crash."

"There is a fine line between not caring and just being an oblivious pet owner. The saddest cases I see are the ones where the animal comes in completely emaciated, vomiting, lethargic, rotten teeth, enlarged kidneys or sky high blood glucose, and they will tell me the animal was fine one week ago and lost all that weight within 2 days. I will tell them that these are all the tell tale signs of a more chronic issue which has been brewing, and prognosis is  fairly poor - further work up, rehabilitation and treatment is x amount of dollars.   They are often the ones without money. It is easy to think they don’t care but when the time comes for euthanasia, they will absolutely break down in tears. My heart breaks every time and in that moment I’m not sure I can accuse them of not caring. But they really did need to put more effort into looking after their animal. 

There are also cases where clients will decline everything you recommend because of money or because they don’t believe you when you say their animal needs treatment. Again, this may be an issue with ignorance. 

I rarely see owners come in for veterinary treatment if they don’t somewhat care for their animal. The ones that don’t care often just throw their animal out on the street or bring them into our shelter as a surrender at a stage when they have a multitude of problems already.

"Last year, I was invited to an Ugly Sweater Christmas party by my friend John who I hadn't seen or talked to for a few years. John and his girlfriend showed up to see one of my sister's high school soccer games a few weeks prior and John and I got caught up with each other a bit while taking in the game under a cool Fall night under the lights out where we both grew up. His girlfriend was nice and I always wondered over the years who he would end up with since he has always had girls all over him in a way that would make men like Don Draper or Barney Stinson jealous. Beautiful girl, too. Big, pretty smile. It was a bit surreal for me to see John and her together. It's one thing to have thoughts in your head for years, thinking about how things might be someday; it's another thing for it to become reality and for you to be able to stare it in the face and to grip its hands when it says ""hello"" to you. I walked away from the two of them that night thinking about how much older I have gotten since I had seen John last and how he has made great strides in becoming a man, leaving behind seemingly any and all traces of the youthful, smart-aleck friend I knew from childhood many years ago. 

A few weeks later, I showed up at John's place in a section of the city where a lot of young professionals live who are getting their start in their careers and who are looking to date and take in the city scene with others like them. John lives with four other guys in a nice place not too far from the busy city center where they all work. It was my first time out there and it was my first time seeing some of my old childhood friends in years. I honestly didn't know what to expect since John looked more like a man when I saw him that night at my sister's game than he did a college kid like I last remembered him. I stepped inside to the party and saw a place filled with guys and girls who I didn't know. John introduced me to some of them and I started connecting the dots and understanding how they all met up and how some of them were connected to the town where John and our friends grew up together. After talking to some of them, a few of my old friends started to show up and it was like a reunion of sorts for me and they greeted me with a big hug and wide eyes since we hadn't seen each other in so long. It was something else, really. They looked older - bigger, stronger I thought - and a few of them had their girlfriends with them as well. There were no signs of the ""Up for whatever"" and ""Let's get plastered"" crew that I used to know and that practically bounced off the walls and tried to chat up and hump anything that moved at parties. In their place were these straight-jawed, well-mannered guys who talked to me about what was going on in my life and with my family as if they were my priest at my local parish who I had decided to pay a visit to after so many years away from the church. It was surreal since I hadn't ever known such...maturity among these guys and among people my age. I hadn't been around much over the years and hadn't seen too many people so I was taken aback by how ""settled"" and relaxed everyone seemed as people moving further from 20 and closer towards 30 years old with each passing day. 

Before I could process it all, John handed me a drink. By the time that I was done with that, I realized that the party was really going strong and that the house was absolutely packed with people. I spotted some guys I used to play basketball and baseball with when we were kids and said hello to them. One said he was working in the financial district downtown and another was there with his girlfriend. He said they were engaged and the wedding was in May. It seemed like yesterday when I used to turn double plays with the former friend and won a regional championship in hoops with the latter over ten years ago. Now they're in finance and fiances. A girl who I went to school with from kindergarten through high school spotted me and came over to me to give me a hug and say hello. She was there with her boyfriend who went to school one township over from me. She had a crush on me in the fifth grade and asked me out. I was nervous and turned her down. She started flirting and talking with me when high school started but I didn't get the hints. She looked great at the party. What might have been...

After a few beers and after an hour or two of trying to reminisce and catch up with people over the blare of the music blasting through the sound system, I was feeling great. I couldn't help but look around the house to see kids I had grown up with fully grown and having a great night out, like we used to have in high school and before, only now in the knowledge that these might be some of the last nights out that we ever have before we all pair off with our significant others and take the fork in the road towards the married life in the not-too-distant future. This realization filled me with a bittersweet feeling that I had never felt before. It was a feeling that sent sharp pangs throughout my body but hurt so good in that all of the good times that I had had with some of the people in that house came rushing back to me in that moment and, for maybe one last time, I was able to recall the better times that we had had together from years ago in our childhood. 

John tapped me on the shoulder, snapping me out of my nostalgic haze, and introduced me to his friend DJ who he roomed with in college. We all talked for a little bit and were eventually joined by a girl who sidled up to us in a Game of Thrones sweater with a White Walker on it. She was fully committed to her outfit since she had the most piercing blue eyes that I had ever seen to go with her White Walker sweater and beautiful, white porcelain skin. The four of us started talking about her sweater and about Game of Thrones before DJ and John went to the keg for themselves and left me and this blue-eyed beauty alone. We were both buzzed and kept chatting about the show and what we thought was going to happen next season, all while staring intently at each other as if we were having the world's greatest conversation. She really was beautiful. I had my eye on her the entire night to be honest with you. For most of that night, she was the most beautiful girl in the room and now our eyes were locked and I was lost in those blue eyes and had no desire to find my way out. We kept having to lean closer towards each other to hear what we were saying because the music had gotten so loud. I didn't mind because a song came on that I hadn't heard in nearly forever and it was the only thing that could have broken my concentration on her and diverted my gaze ever so slightly from her eyes. Just as that song and its beat swelled around me and brought me back to my days in middle school where I had heard it last, she put her phone to her ear, said a few words, looked me in the eyes with those blue eyes of hers and with a smile said ""My ride is here. See you around"" and then turned away from me for what might be forever. As her wavy brown hair bobbed its way through a crowded sea of sweaters towards the exit, this song boomed and bounced perfectly in sync with her right up until the moment when she turned around slightly, looked back at me with those blue eyes of hers, and smiled before being swallowed up by the crowd, out of my sight but never out of mind. 

That night wasn't so much about her as it was about a night where I realized just how far my friends and I had come in life and how a night out together was going to be from here on out before they start to become a relic of our past as kids and then college guys who were always looking for the time of our lives, every night out together. We had all gotten older and grown up together and coming to that absolute realization on that night was truly bittersweet. Whenever I hear that song, I think of that night and of that blue-eyed girl who I haven't seen since but will never forget. [That girl who I was so into.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmwx8oYd37I)

"I cheated on my fiance the entire time we were engaged with my former best friend. She was hotter than my fiance and I had always been in love with here, but she was married with kids and nothing ever worked out for us timing wise. 

When I returned home from New York newly engaged, we met for lunch and she professed her long secret love for me. I was very happily shocked to find out she felt the same way all those years, and we began an affair. Her cheating on here husband, and me cheating on my now fiance. We had some of the best sex I've ever had for that whole year up until the wedding. 

My mistress friend offered to do the makeup for my wife and her bridesmaids, so she came up for the wedding. She was not comfortable staying for the wedding but did follow through on the makeup part. She arrived to the wedding venue while all the girls were at the hair salon, and I was alone in the house we had rented. She showed up wearing a super sexy skirt and no panties. So, on the morning of my wedding, I  had sex one last time with her while my wife to be was getting her hair done. We ended the affair after I went through with the wedding. "

Who do I talk to about getting X, Y, Z product.""
No matter what I said he was not convinced until it took 3 separate people to confirm who I am. For some reason he got annoyed, and just left.

"Many nursing home communities require a massive deposit to move in, mid-6-figures.  They earn interest on that deposit, but that's not the dirty part.  The dirty part is in the fine print:

Marketing staff will tell you that the deposit is returned once the leased unit is relinquished.  And that's technically true. But what they don't tell you is that the contract defines ""relinquishment"" as ""whenever the marketing staff fills that unit again.""

So if Grandma dies or moves out, and her apartment is vacated, marketing staff will intentionally **not fill that unit again for years at a time,** to keep earning interest on the deposit.  This results in countless retirees and their surviving families becoming financially destitute as they wait for some leasing agent to feel like giving them back their money."

"I only recently discovered there was more than one type of BBQ sauce (e.g. Kansas, Alabama white sauce, Carolina mustard BBQ sauce, etc.) This blew my mind and I was so excited I tracked down a bottle of south Carolina mustard BBQ sauce; I am now absolutely hooked on the stuff, so are a couple of friends and my dad. I feel like my BBQ food has been a lie until now!

As a result, I'm now excited to try loads more different US style BBQ foods and sauces (heading out there for a few weeks later this year, fully intend to gorge myself). Any particular recommendations?

Also, in and out burger - I hear nothing but good things and can't wait to see how good they really are."

"Harrar is a small, walled city, that is thousands of years old. The walls have, for lack of a better term, ""pet doors"" (slightly larger than a doggy door). At night, they let wild hyenas into the city to raccoon 2.0 garbage bins, thus eliminating waste. If you walk through the city an hour or so after dusk, you're likely to pass a hyena or two. But if you hang out outside the city walls with a bucket of meat and a stick, well..."

"I grew up in a very family-centric environment. My best friends are my cousins etc. If there's anything I'm thankful of now that I'm an adult and I realize the cost of it, it's that none of my friends ever let me go somewhere on my own (I couldn't anyway, no money for the commute, and when I started working on weekends I used that money to help my mother). Let's go play football? My older cousin would pick me up and drop me off. To the beach? Same. I've never had to pay for these trips. And now that I go around by myself I realize the money it represents. So I now keep this legacy alive and offer rides regardless. I take my little bro and his friends around when I can. If we go to the movies with friends I'll just pick them up. I don't really mind, it's a natural part of the hangout to me and it's my turn to give that service. I was going out anyway so I'm prepared to pay that money and I'll never ask someone else to pay it for me. If I couldn't pay it I would have stayed at home.

I remember an experience when going to uni. A classmate was driving home and suggested I jump on because my place was on his way. Cool. Then he asked me for gas money. I found it so incredibly rude. Especially as a broke student. And maybe due to my standards of ""if you offer the ride you are not expecting anything in return"". And that's when I realized that I grew up in a blessed environment lol. It's up to me to keep this alive so my friends and family perpetrate the standard!"

"Wedding planner. Someone is always pissed at you. Even if the bride and groom are chill, there's a mother/mil, maid of honor or vendor unhappy. And frankly at the end of the day you want the client to feel they've been treated fairly, but you really need the vendor to leave happy. You can't afford to alienate someone in the industry (especially in a smaller town). This is actually why full-service planning is better than day of (for the planner), it's easier to avoid misunderstandings when you're involved in contract negotiations from the get-go."
"I was about 16 and babysitting for an obviously well off family. Father was a lawyer, not sure what the mother did. Weird couple. She was lanky and maybe 6 inches taller then him. He was short and fat and just a grumpy dude. Their two sons were wretched spoiled brats. They paid well so I continued to babysit for them on and off for maybe 6 months. 

While I was admittedly snooping around this guys office, I found a very intriguing treasure box about waist high on one of his several book shelves. It wasn't locked and the contents are making me laugh as I type this: 

-about half ounce of pot
-pink vibrator
-metal cock ring
-butt plug
-several different types of pills scattered around the box
-couple dozen polaroids from what looked like a weird BDSM party in the 80s, including the couple doing weird fetish shit 

Was hard to look them in the eyes after they got back that night. Both because I smoked a joint of his grass and because I couldn't get the image of this lawyer with a ball gag getting paddled by his wife out of my head.

I walk into the room and he's got his iPad out, looking at something from it. I knew he had some exams coming up so didn't think anything of it, maybe he was just revising?

Anyway I took his resume and started asking him questions about what courses he's doing and his internship experience, you know the usual. But strangely enough his tablet remained out, on his desk. When I looked over he had his CV open on it.

Every time I asked a question, he first looked at his CV, read it for a while and then answered. Was his memory so bad he couldn't remember his own life story or he had to remind himself of the lies he put down?

Either way he didn't get the job."

My parents also want to ensure that me and my sisters didn't grow up to be entitled shit heads, so if we wanted something that didn't directly relate to our education or wellbeing we were paying for it (we were all employed by the family business by the time we were 13). 

What I learnt doing baby sitting for my young cousins that they were experience the complete opposite, they got what ever they wanted when ever, it was so surreal to interact with these kids who casual talk about and showed me toys, phones, watches and various other items that my uncle and aunt got them on basically a whim.

My wife is a member too and was going to buy four bottles but because it wasn't part of her monthly subscription they applied delivery costs, so she didn't proceed. She got a phone call the next day as their system detected it was in her basket, she had gone to checkout but not bought them. They offered her the free delivery then asked which of the four bottles were her favourite and gave her another two for free."

What followed was 2 weeks of heartache as my dog was dying of organ failure.  My dog went from ""apparently healthy"" to ""dead"" in just over 2 weeks.  

So now if my other dog doesn't eat his full dinner, or seems slightly more lethargic than normal, or sneezes one too many times and I'm absolutely certain he's dying, too.  "

I didn't really register it at first because I figured we would be putting furniture in there with the load we were delivering but that didn't happen and I mentioned to a co-worker how the one room was bigger than my living room and completely bare and he said ""maybe they're getting stuff during another round?"" and the guy heard and said ""nah that room is staying empty - I have no use for it. Same with the others too.""  I couldn't really wrap my head around a lot of things after that.  First off to be rich enough to afford a house like that, then on top of that, purposefully have parts of your house go completely unused because you don't care about them.  Like...why even buy a house that big then?  Why overdo it and leave some of it unused?  Why not just buy what you need and use it all?  Rich people are weird."

"I absolutely hate writing tickets. I don't enjoy ruining someone's day and I especially hate traffic court. That being said, there's a few things I take into account when deciding if you're going to get a ticket from me: 

- *Your Driving Record.* If I run your license and I see you have a terrible driving record then I'm more likely to give you a ticket. If you've never had a ticket before then you will pretty much have to talk me into giving you one. I don't like to ruin someone's perfect driving record. 

- *Your Demeanor.* I cannot stress enough how much your attitude towards me can help decide whether or not you get a ticket. I literally have the power to make you pay a fine and perhaps cause your insurance to go up and yet somehow you think it's a good idea to yell at me for stopping you for running a red light. I don't take it personally. Between this job and my previous retail experience I've been yelled at so much I'm numb to it. But it sure makes it easier for me to write you a ticket after you explain to me how much of a piece of shit I am. Letting your passenger(s) rant/yell at me doesn’t help you either. Just be calm and polite to my face. You can curse me out under your breath after you drive away and suckered me into letting you go with a warning. Seriously...I just don’t get why most people can’t fake being nice for a few minutes. 

- *The Type of Violation.* If I pulled you over for going through 3 red lights in a row then you better have a damn good excuse. On the other side of the coin if you just have a tail light out I will never write the ticket, unless of course you act like an asshole. 

- *Your Age.* I don’t write people over 60 unless they do something so blatantly awful I have to issue them a summons. Why 60? Because that’s the “I’m too old for this shit age.” They’ve been on this planet long enough and they deserve a break. I try not to write new drivers, unless of course they talk themselves into a ticket. 

- *Honesty.* This one is tricky. Some cops will tell you to never admit you did something wrong because then it makes it easier to issue a ticket. Personally, I like it when someone is honest. It means they are acknowledging and taking responsibility for their actions. I don’t like it when I am right behind your vehicle and you blow past a stop sign and swear up and down that you came to a complete stop. You didn’t. I was RIGHT behind you when you did it.  

- *Automatic Tickets.* If you say I pulled you over because you’re (insert race/ethnicity/gender). You are automatically getting a ticket. 

I’m sure there’s other things but you get the idea. The main thing is your demeanor. I’m still surprised how many people talk themselves into a summons with their attitude. "

Once I'd managed to snap out of the hypnotised feeling, I got the hell out, but I felt like I shouldn't run, so I just walked briskly and tried to look calm.

"My grandmother. Born in the early 1900s. Married to a wonderful and loving husband for 50+ years. Raised 6 children that are pinnacles of kindness, charity, good work ethic, and moral virtue. Never hesitated to provide service to others in her neighborhood by visiting them when they needed a friend or bringing them food when they were sick. Had a contagious laugh and always loved a good practical joke. Constantly smiling, and always found a way to bring humor into every situation. Started getting sick at age 93 and moved to an assisted living center, where she still found time to have a speed race with my uncle down the hallway with her walker, laughing the entire way. When she died she was surrounded by family and friends, and lived the happiest life anyone could imagine. Because of her, there are now generations of grandchildren that have inherited the best qualities of her personality and have been brought up to be pillars of strength, empathy, and positive influences on all those around them.

"One of the greatest things about the movie is they mixed seasons and time periods to create an unsettling feeling because the setting isn't logical. There are 50s tvs, 70s cars and cards from the early twentieth century. The shell e-reader functions like a kindle, but has no modern equivalent. It also seems to be the only object that has modern technology in a house that has wallpaper and cord phones. The characters spend time outdoors in pools but in the same week wear winter coats while everyone else in the background dresses lightly. The filmmakers really brought it all together to create an eerie sense of unease.

"My parents did that to me a few significant times as a kid and it gave me recurring nightmares about not being believed. When I was a kid I'd have these vivid dreams that I was trying to warn my mom about something bad happening (a hurricane coming, or the person she invited to dinner being a murderer) and her not listening to me or believing me. When I'm particularly stressed out I still have them, even at 28 years old. Although now it's about my husband or my job, but the theme remains the same - knowing something bad is going to happen and nobody listening to me. I don't want kids but I NEVER, EVER dismiss my nieces when they tell me things. It's probably exaggerated much of the time, but I give them the benefit of a doubt. I want them to trust me and feel validated and listened to. "

What does me being bullied have to do with my depression when the depression has to do with existential thoughts? I'm hoping there is an explanation for that.

"I lived in a pediatric hospital for several years while waiting for a liver. Met many kids who'd try to play like healthy kids despite what they were dealing with. 
My best buddy Seamus was a babu with hlhs. I met him when he was 7 months old (I was 16) and he'd already had several open heart surgeries. Unfortunately he passed at 14 months. He'd be 10 now. He was always happy and would do his 'wiggle dance' to make everyone smile. 
Look up Sleep Well Seamus on YouTube to see his tribute video with the wiggle dance. 

Another friend was Jeremiah, an infant with gastroschesis. He liked peekaboo and loved everyone. I'd love to know how he's doing but it was a decade ago and my nurses can't tell me. I hope he's well. 

Flor was 2, but only the size of a 9 month old. She had some sort of syndrome that doctors couldn't identify. They thought maybe a form of dwarphism. It would freak people out when she'd say hi because she looked like an infant and she could talk. 

We had body parts bingo and hospital bingo that we could play from our rooms. The fact that 3 year olds could say gastronemius and otoscope when their own parents couldn't was pretty crazy. 

I remember having to have an MRI and the little girl in the next bed was after me. She was scared so I asked if she'd been to a parade. She had, so I told her it'd be noisy like when the firetrucks drive by, and all the drums from the marching bands. She was a lot less afraid after that and her mom thanked me. Nobody likes MRIs, from adults to little kids. 

I met a little girl with cystic fibrosis. I told her how I'd learned about it in anatomy class and she was excited that I knew what it was. She was about 5-6. 

I often wonder how theyre all doing today. Im still in contact with some of my nurses, but obviously they can't tell me anything because of patient confidentiality.


Update; apparently this was shared on Knowable and reached Seamus' mom (who I'm still friends with, she was at my wedding too) she was very touched and glad to know that Seamus' memory lives on. "

While out hunting with my old man, I was 13. I had the, I'm bored, tired of walking attitude when my dad grabs the back of my jacket. He points up the the trail ahead of us.  Perched in a tree staring down from me at about 30 yards away was a mountain lion. 

A few years ago, I was sitting in the Pine tree's, bugling for a bull elk.  I got a few bugles in reply then it went quiet. I waited for half an hour sitting next to a tree.  I caught a some movement on my left side, I peeked around the tree to see 2 wolves walking up to me. I stood up, they tucked tail and ran. 

My brother and I were headed up to a mountain lake via horseback.  My horse was acting really weird when we came to the clearing that was about 100 yards below the lake.  My brother's horse started acting weird as well. I couldn't keep mine on the trail and had to spur her a bit to keep her moving forward.  My brother spotted an Elk antler in the distance that was moving.  I figured it was the bull elk that was making my horse act weird.  As we're moving forward up the trail, a grizzly peaks his head up near the antlers.  We got our horses turned around, I gave her a slight nudge in the ribs and we were off to the races.  I wasn't scared that the bear was going to kill us. I was scared about getting bucked off this old bitch mare as she moved at the speed of Mach Jesus. "

"If you're married in most situations you're name goes on the birth certificate regardless of the situation. Also in many situations the mother can just put your name as the father without you signing, sure technically they have to have an affidavit of paternity in some states but they don't require you to sign it, the mother can in your name, legally, and if you don't fight it within a set amount of time you're stuck with the child support payments, even if you never knew that she put your name on the BV in the first place.

What's even fucking crazier? There is a thing called a Paternal Registry in some states. I live in PA, we have 'one'. If you go to the website to fill out the form for it, the link redirects you to New Hampshire's State Administrative Offices Fax number. Yeah, lotta good that will do.
What this allows you to do is be notified when the mother attempts to forfeit her parental rights. It doesn't actually give the father any rights whatsoever. You can show up to speak in a hearing for the childs best interests, but only if the adoption agency and judge agree, which they have never.

So what's all this mean? Let's say a girl claims your the father at the hospital and with the adoption agency/State Health Department. No one tells you. She gives the kid up. No one tells you. Later something gets fucked up and the State files for child support from the father of the child.

Well, even if you never fucked that girl you are going to have to go to court to prove that you can't support that kid financially. DNA tests don't mean anything, the mother lying doesn't mean anything, the state not performing their proper duty in telling you about the child that someone is claiming is yours doesn't mean anything, and the ONLY thing family courts will ask is if you giving that child money could help it out, which it always will.

You can sue the mother for the cost of the child support, but if you win the state has no way to force her to pay, and if you start missing child support payments they will dock your pay and jail you."

In 1795 Kamehameha I sailed from his home island of Hawaiʻi with an army of 10,000 warriors, including a handful of non-Hawaiian foreigners. After conquering the islands of Maui and Molokaʻi, he moved on to Oʻahu. The pivotal battle for the island occurred in Nuʻuanu Valley, where the defenders of Oʻahu, led by Kalanikūpule, were driven back up into the valley where they were trapped above the cliff. More than 400 of Kalanikūpule's soldiers were driven off the edge of the 1,000-foot cliff to their deaths."

"This lie put me and my little sister into foster care for a few years when we were young, but old enough to form memories. Corrupt judge put us there even though there was no proof from the investigation. 


Side note: The memories I have from the investigation felt like sexual abuse itself. I did NOT want someone looking at me or asking me about my private parts. My mom taught me they were mine and nobody could touch them or look at them but me. But I couldn't refuse a court ordered investigation and I didn't understand what was happening entirely. 


 Finally my mom was granted a new judge after requesting one and our social worker quit her career just to testify for us to go home. I don't know where she is now or what she does, but she literally destroyed everything she worked for, for us. I would like to thank her one day, but I don't know her name. Maybe my mom does. We were home within a few months of getting a new judge.

"Not sure if it counts but when I was 8 we went to Scotland to visit family for two weeks and my alcoholic grandfather and aunt (moms sister, they don't get along at all) waited outside my grans house one day and took my sister and I while we were in the garden. Being so small and knowing the people taking us we went along happily. We were taken to some old castle and an indoor play gym called monkey something or other. They apparently both had been drinking the whole day and were driving around drunk with us. We started whining eventually because it's late and cold and we wanted to go home to our mom, my grandfather got angry and called us ungrateful etc and took us back to my grans and there were police everywhere. My mom had reported us missing, police had been searching for us all day, everyone was very stressed because a little girl had been attacked in the area just before we flew over. So we got out the car and there were officers and my mom running at us, it was very confusing and we thought we were in trouble. The officers spoke to us and later my mom explained what happened, why there were police and why everyone was so upset. I've never asked about it since so I don't know if they were arrested/charged with anything or not, but they weren't allowed near us for the rest of the time we were over there and we've never seen or really heard from either of them since.

"While this wasn't an injury that I personally suffered, I was absolutely to blame for it.

Back when I was living in my first apartment, I thought it would be a good idea to get myself some silk sheets. The intention was to create an environment of classy sensuality for any young women who might spend the night at my house (without having to drop a fortune on things like champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries). As I discovered, though, silk sheets are damned expensive... and given that I was a broke college student, I couldn't exactly afford the top-quality bed-coverings.

Thus, I made the mistake of purchasing *cheap* silk bed sheets.

Anyone who has spent any time wrapped in low-quality silk knows how incredibly unpleasant an experience it can be: You start off feeling like the sheets *should* be soft and smooth, but there's this annoying tickle that dances across your entire body. Rolling into different positions is a crap-shoot between sliding around between slippery folds and dragging them along with you. You start to sweat, and the material actually sticks to you a little bit, making your bed less of relaxing cocoon and more of a sweltering burrito.

There was one other issue, as well... but I didn't discover it until I actually followed through on my plan of having a young woman sleep over.

After a particularly active (and unwisely long) session together, the girl and I passed out next to each other with nothing but those silk sheets between us and the hot night air. I got up once during the night, relieved myself in the bathroom, and went back to bed, which woke my partner from the depths of her own slumber. She apparently decided to emulate my actions... only instead of quietly returning from the restroom, she rushed in and shook me awake, demanding to know if I had any sexually transmitted diseases.

Now, I've always been careful about staying clean (and we'd discussed as much), so the accusations were more than a little bit jarring. When I asked what had prompted them, the young woman turned on the light and displayed her naked form to me... and I saw that much of her body had been dyed a light shade of blotchy purple.

A brief examination revealed that my own skin had adopted an oddly violet tint, too.

We eventually figured out that my cheap-as-hell, knockoff silk bed sheets had bled during the night, transferring their color to my paramour and me. Worse still, the stuff didn't wash off as easily as I would have liked, and the two of us spent more than a little time in the shower together. It *could have* been an enjoyable evening, but mutual bathing just isn't as much fun when the intention is actually to get clean.

I also had to change my bed sheets before we could finally pass out again.

**TL;DR: A girl dyed in my bed.**"

The dog died. I had problems with being around my dog for a couple weeks. I knew he did it to protect me but watching him rip apart a dogs head was terrifying. "

"At camping festivals, where you are allowed to bring in a grill/charcoal, it is super easy. 

Simply buy the largest 20lb bag of charcoal you can find, then open the bag very carefully on the bottom. 

Dump out all the charcoal. 

Fill it with beer (can hold about 30-40 cans). 

Pack some left over charcoal around the sides/bottom to even out the bag.

Reinforce the bottom with some cardboard and hot glue it all back up.

Carry bag of charcoal with your grill right through the line and no one will even check it. 

Have used this many, MANY times and have never had an issue. I know it doesn't sound like the bottom of the bag will hold with all that beer, but if you are pretty heavy on the glue, it works perfectly. "

"My mother was paralyzed because of spinal cancer in 2004. Everyone at church kept telling her to get an automatic wheelchair but she refused. People thought I was a jerk for telling her otherwise. (I was in seventh grade)

"Friends of mine and I go shooting regularly out in the middle of nowhere in AZ, and since a few of my friends are avid collectors, we usually bring a small arsenal with us. Multiple large-caliber rifles, AKs, ARs, handguns, you name it. One of our favorite spots is the top of a hill, maybe a few hundred feet high, surrounded by smaller hills that are pretty equally spaced at 100, 200, 300+ meters so we can easily set up targets for an entire day's worth of shooting.

One time we were spotted by an airplane scanning for trafficking activity, and they sent a task force to approach us. They came to the base of our hill and used a bullhorn to address us in Spanish. We replied in English, showed them that our guns were on the ground, and walked down to them.

Long story short, once they found out who we were they told us that they thought we might be scouting locations or providing armed support ahead of a trafficking run. They took a look at our setup, watched us polish off a few targets at 200m or so, and even took a try on our big .308 magnum. Eventually, one of the officers recommended to us that we should leave as we could encounter armed resistance. The leader of their task force took one look at our arsenal and said ""nah, they're fine. If you run into anyone with guns, call us. If they see you, light them up. Drug runners tend to be armed but can't shoot for shit, plus you've got the high ground so you'll be fine I'm sure."" 

And he just left us there. Luckily we didn't see anyone, though.

*Edit: No, I don't have photos of that day, I was just responding to the original comment. I do have photos of some of our arsenal though in the same location, different date.

"The couple had two kids, nasty divorce, mother claimed father was cheating, father didn't deny it. He was ordered to pay 1k in child support until the kids turned 21 or graduated college. The mother brought him back to court over the next few years, claiming she needed more for child support. Father reluctantly agreed - after all it's for the children. Another eight years later and the mother is in jail for cocaine. It turns out she was using the money for her addiction instead of her kids.

"We were felling trees with my teen boys when I heard an, ""Ow!"" - looked up and middle son is slapping a bee off his ear... And here comes the rest of the swarm, doing that thing bees do to warn you off, booping into him.

Guess the vibrations of the chainsaw and too many people around or the dog stepped on the hive (was in old log on ground) and the bees fixated on middle son.

So I told him to hop in the van and drove him out of there. No biggie, right? He got stung a handful of times but he's not allergic or anything.

Bf was *incredulous*... He thoroughly believed that my son and I had panicked and bolted because we *saw a bee*. 

Um, what? We sure did see a bee. Then we saw the other bee. And then all of their little bee friends. How did you miss the CLOUD OF BEES?

I had to hold his hand through the reality that my son was swarmed, had a half-dozen stings he wasn't bitching about, and please, honey, please ... the only kind of person who would ""run at the sight of a bee"" is not a ""pussy!"" but someone who was deathly allergic and not in possession of their epipen... So even if my son was ""running like a bitch because he saw a bee!"", the logical presumption would then be he was in serious danger and trying not to die. 

Please think less about how you think this makes you look tough because bee stings don't phase you and think more about how this makes you look callous and stupid for not being able to determine ""reasons"" why other people might not stick around bees. "

Every single time we'd try getting him involved she'd come up with some reason that he couldn't.

"Sometimes, predators deliberately choose victims who are already seen as ""problem children"" and have a reputation of being ""bad"" and untrustworthy.

"&gt; Lasik eye surgery. Pay for the doctor and staff who are highly respected, have published in medical journals, etc., and will take a great deal of time and effort with measurements to make sure they'll get it right.

My best friend chose a LASIK surgeon from a radio advertisement (Baltimore).  He had the surgery and it completely fucked up his vision.  He could not drive at night and had greatly reduced vision during the day.  He was a truck driver and was completely screwed.  The surgeon told him, well that's how these things turn out sometimes and wasn't interested in helping him further.  

He searched for help and found a specialist whose practice revolved around botched LASIK surgery.  He even saw a specialist who happened to be the guy who taught the doctor who did the surgery.  That specialist said my friend was a text book example of someone who should never have LASIK surgery yet the doctor proceeded with the surgery.  The specialist said he knew for a fact that the surgeon knew not to do the surgery because he taught him.  He also added that the surgeon was a millionaire today because he'll perform surgery on anyone who walks through the door.  I drove him to Atlanta Georgia to see a specialist there as well.  

Long story short, the surgeon had such an iron clad disclaimer that no attorney was willing to take on the case.  Over the years, and after a number of other surgeries his vision has improved but is no where near what it was.  He has a desk job today.  

PM me if you want the LASIK surgeon's name.  "

"In the book, they had motion detectors that would count the number of creatures on the island.  However, the flaw in the system was that it required an input and would then confirm that number to stop counting.  So if you asked it to find 100 animals, it would return ""100 animals found"".  It didn't occur to them until after everything went wrong to set a high upper limit and see how many creatures the system would actually find.  Finding the eggs was, if I remember correctly, was what led them to this realization of the system's shortcoming."

"When i worked at a summer camp, we had one group of kids who were extremely poorly behaved. Myself and the other three counsellors just couldnt keep control of these kids for more than 5 minutes.

There were a few doubters in the group, so she assured them that the nearby sewer grate was the entrance to this secret underground club. They spent the rest of the week like little angels, and as soon as one of them started to act up, they would instantly be quieted by a half dozen others saying ""Dont you wanna see the underground club? We have to be good to see the underground club!"" At the end of the week, we had some VERY disappointed children on our hands. idk why the director didnt just promise them something realistic. she decided to go with the ""secret underground club"" story, and we all had to play along or else tell the kids that our boss was a liar. It was awful but also kindof hilarious. "

That's where the industrial style comes from. These big old abandoned factories were being taken over by late-20th-century hipsters, who were renovating the spaces while maintaining the industrial elements (because they were broke, most of the time, and couldn't afford to finish out the rooms). It gradually became the ""style of artists"" in New York, and gained a widespread appeal in the late 00s, before becoming mass-produced in the 10s. 

It's an interesting style, historically, because it doesn't come from the rich, like traditional or modern decorating styles. Industrial chic comes from an era and place of poverty, was adopted by the rich, and then returned to the general public in the midst of a recession, due to its affordable nature. Now we're seeing it return to the rich again, but anyone can still go down to Home Depot and toss together some decent furniture in an afternoon.

"Was part of the nerdy, overachieving clique in high school.  A bunch of us had this incredibly old (80+) advanced placement teacher who was seriously Alzheimering.  It was sad to see, but it also was seriously screwing up our GPAs because he was giving us college-level exams on material he hadn't even come close to covering in class.  He just had no fucking idea.  Practically the entire class failed his mid-term and we were *pissed*... no one in administration was taking our complaints seriously, and this was seriously jeopardizing our college plans.  So a few enterprising types hatched a plan where a few students would preoccupy the teacher in the back of the class with some mundane questions while another went up to his desk and changed all the penciled-in mid-term grades in his grade-book from Ds and Fs to As and Bs.  

It worked a treat, and we all made it through the course with decent final grades.  But every now and again I see news stories about students caught doing exactly this, and their entire lives get fucked as a result.  Guess we got lucky."

"Pretty much, Japanese invaded Nanking, then capital of the Republic of China, and went on a month-long killing, torturing and raping spree. No-one was off limits. Women, children, infants, the elderly. 20,000 women were estimated to have been raped, not counting children, who were sometimes sliced open to make it easier for the soldiers to penetrate. Civilians were rounded up and executed, with bayonets or landmines. China estimates the civilian casualties as 300,000, while the International Tribunal for the Far East estimated 200,000 murdered. Murder became a game for the invading Japanese soldiers, with one contest being announced to see who could be the first to kill 100 civilians with a sword.

Japanese scholars tend to gloss over it, and put civilian casualties at around 20,000-40,000. Soldiers that took part in the massacre openly admitted that the atrocities did indeed occur, but there have been a vocal group of Japanese politicians and lawmakers that deny it ever happened.

One of the darkest and most horrific episodes in modern history.

"  When I was 12-13 I use to have to avoid home due to a parent using meth and the people that it/they brought by. So I use to sleep in our childhood tree fort the first few times. Up into the woods about a half mile off the road, and up a hill, it was a good vantage point in case I heard anything.
  One night I woke up and looked out to just see a guy staring up at the fort and I froze and held the gaze and slowly laid down onto my back. I heard him walk closer and just thought to yell, ""Dad wake up someone's coming up!"" He darted off into the woods but had I not thought to say that who knows. My Dad lived two states away and the only bluff I knew to yell.

"Copied and pasted from my TIFU post, but it's just too good to pass up.

You know how everyone has that ""party"" story? The one that, no matter how hard you try, will never be topped? Well, I'm a second year college student who attends a university that likes to go by the mantra of ""work hard, play hard"", and this is that story.

A couple of weeks ago, I was invited to a pretty big annual (if somewhat niche) event at my school that had a reputation of having a pretty wild afterparty. My buddy (let's call him Dewey) had just finished his semester and I hadn't, so he was pretty bored back in our hometown. I figured that, since he had nothing to do back at home, I would bring him to the afterparty and he could crash back at my dorm for the night, have a good time and all that. And we did. We had a fucking fantastic time. Even made it back to my dorm in one piece somehow. I thought we just went back and crashed, but apparently some serious shit went down after the party that I didn't hear about until later, and by then there was nothing I could do except laugh and think ""there's no way that happened.""

So fast forward to the morning after. It's windy as all hell outside and Dewey and I are sitting at a dining hall having some delicious hangover food. Suddenly, this conversation comes up:

""Dude...I did something last night.""

""What did you do?""

""Something...something bad.""

""Dewey, what the hell did you do?""

Then he hits me with what ACTUALLY happened that night after we left the party. Apparently, I was too blacked out to remember, but he definitely wasn't. And once he started recalling the story, I began to remember the shitshow that transpired afterwards. To this day, whenever I tell this story, people don't believe me...until I show them. But I'll get to that later.

So we leave the party, stumble our way back to the dorm, and get into the elevator, since I live on the 7th floor. We get out of the elevator without incident and kind of just plop down in my floor's lounge, which was thankfully empty. Seems alright. But then Dewey throws up. Fucking. Everywhere. On the couch, on the study tables, on the floor, on the goddamn walls...no surface was safe from his wrath.

At this point, I'm already disgusted and thinking ""oh fuck, he's my guest so I'm responsible for this oh fuck oh fuck housing probation here I come"". But then it got worse. It got so much worse.

After the pukepocalypse, he then says he has to ""go"". So I hand him my ID card so he can swipe into the bathroom, which I should mention is a mere 20 feet away from us. But he turns me down and says, ""nah man, I gotta go now...like right now...and it's gonna be a big one"".

Dewey then opens my lounge window, sticks his buttcheeks out, and proceeds to release the Kraken all over the side of my precious dormitory building. And when I say release the Kraken, I mean it. The immediate assault to my senses told me that it was easily the most disgusting toilet slammer I've ever been witness to in my entire life, including my own. Imagine every terrible shit you've ever taken multiplied by the fiery passion of a thousand burning suns. It was like watching the Slime fall and splatter everywhere on the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Awards. The sound it made was awful too, like something just died and these were its final gurgles. Just the fucking smell alone probably could have killed most small animals. 

He finishes unleashing his unholy intestinal sewage all over the side of my building while I sit there just agape but too drunk to do anything about it. Then we nonchalantly stroll back to my room and promptly pass out. 

Back to the present: I'm horrified. Disgusted. Never in my life would I have imagined I would be privy to anything like this. But eh, what's done is done, fuck it, no harm done right?

Wrong.

I make my way back to my building and ride the elevator up  so that I can relax and nurse my hangover. In the elevator, I hear this conversation between two random girls:

""I can't believe someone did that to our lounge.""

""Yeah, that's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen...it smelled pretty bad in there too. The cleaning lady says it's either really bad throw up or something way worse.""

""Do they know who did it?""

""I don't know, but they must have been living higher up to hit floor 4. At least it didn't get inside or anything.""

Now I'm curious. And I think I know exactly what happened. So I get off on the fourth floor, enter their lounge, and lo and behold, I see [this masterpiece.](https://imgur.com/gallery/2dKnA) 

Yep. That's Dewey's shit. Smeared all over the window of the lounge three floors below me. 

Apparently, some people were peacefully studying at 3 in the morning the night that this shit went down when all of a sudden...WHAM, Dewey's butt babies slammed into their window hard enough to make the glass shake. The wind must have hurled it sideways mid-descent, causing his work of art to splatter onto their window with a resounding thud. 

I take one good look (and smell), snap the picture, and flee to my room practically dying from laughter. Then I tell pretty much all of our friends back at home because, come on, how do you not tell everyone about that? I didn't tell any of my college friends though, I don't need that kind of blood (poop?) on my hands, and for good reason. Admin heard about it and basically put out a warrant for the capture of whoever did the deed or for anyone who helped them do it. I basically had to be on my toes for the rest of the semester in fear of being charged as an assistant to this assailant of justice. People from other dorms eventually heard about it and began sullying the good name of my building, calling it ""Shit Central"" and other hilarious names.

They didn't just forget about him either. For the rest of the year, the ""Phantom Shitter"" became something of a legend. No one knew who it was, but they know what he did, and what he's capable of. His legacy lives on--in me, in you, but mostly in the shit smears he left trailing down the side of my dormitory. Those are a little bit harder to wash off.

TL;DR Brought a friend to a college party, shit went down, stained my building's reputation (and my building)."
I took the train weekends to go see my bf back in college. In the winter my usual train that I took the whole way turned into a transfer halfway there due to weather and track conditions.

Tickets never expired so I used it my next ride and got a free train ride :)

"My dad and I were clearing out our garage when I was about 10. We uncovered a tiny old black and white television that hadn't been switched on in probably about 30 years. Out of curiosity to see whether this ancient TV still worked, we switched it on and the first thing that came up on screen was my sister's face...she had been on a school trip to some sort of local food fair or something and she was in the background of an interview on our local news channel...to this day I've still never had a weirder coincidence "
"There are two conflicting facts and one thing that most people don't talk about directly that lead to unsuccessful diets:

1) As many people say, calories in &lt; calories out will make you lose weight, however:

2) Most people don't feel ""full"" (aka: lose the food-craving of hunger) because they've eaten enough calories, but because they've eaten enough volume to fill their stomachs (there's a bit more to it, but this is basically true).

Some really simple things help to fix this:

1) Eat beans and lentils as a main portion of your diet. They are really filling, really high-protein, and have other good things in them. They are also relatively low-calorie; I've eaten so many beans over a week, and still lost weight.

2) Eat slowly and talk during your meal, as in, between bites of food; it takes some time for food to hit your stomach, and everyone knows that feeling of ""I shouldn't have had that much"" from time to time. Give your stomach some time to send the ""I'm not hungry anymore, please stop sending in food, kthx"" signal to the brain.

3) Forget everything you've ever been told about ""clearing your plate"". No matter what you do, the extra half a meal on your plate is never going to be able to get to the starving kids around the world. Donate to some charities if that's a thing that you actually want to help solve, but shoving down food that you aren't hungry for is just going to contribute to weight gain. If there's enough left for another potential meal when you're hungry, just wrap it up and save it for leftovers. If there isn't, just trash it.

4) If you're over 30, try eating foods you didn't like again. I have a newfound love for raw spinach since I've turned 30, when I hated it as a teen and even into my 20s. Your taste buds change as you age, and you might enjoy healthy foods more than you think.

5) Cut out sodas. This gets said a lot, but it's true. If your lunch is a turkey club sandwich, a 20 oz bottle of soda is adding 33-50% more calories to that meal. They are a relative *ton* of calories that don't make you feel more full or quench your thirst at all."
"It is not a necessary evil for the kids. It is a necessary evil for the employees. The kids need love then and there, not later. When they distance themselves all they're imprinting is that people dont love anyone. Kids can handle loss just fine. 

In a normal family, its normal for a child to see their grandparents die. They adapt well. Loss is part of life. What is also a part of life is connections and love, and adoption centers sit on this stupid argument to justify not giving them what they need.

People come and go in our lives. While they are here, kids expect them to love. 

Necessary evil, my ass."

It's trending toward fairly progressive, even the most conservative people are generally very friendly and open to all types of people. We have the best food (typical Southern cuisine, plus BBQ, great burgers, &amp; surprisingly good Mexican food), good music (not just country, lots of indie/rock/jazz), and you're a beautiful three-four hour drive from the Smokies or Memphis, eight hours from Panama City Beach, and about ten from Jacksonville. Not to mention the neat places in bordering states (Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, South/North Carolina, Virginia, ect). I know people tend to crucify the South, but Tennessee is a beautiful mix of the old and the new. I'd advise everybody to at least visit."

"I had kind of a dysfunctional childhood and I was adopted twice. Both times were by members of my family. I was named by dad and my birth mother Christin Michelle. When my aunt and uncle adopted me, they changed my first and middle name to Christen Margaret Morgan (Yeah, they saddled me with two middle names). When my grandparents adopted me (about 11 or 12), they changed my name back to my birth name... so I spent my teenage years firmly believing that my name was Christin Michelle. 
Years down the road, I had to get a copy of my SSN card and my adoption papers and that is when I discovered that my name is not Christin Michelle nor Christin Margaret Morgan.

My name is Christy Michel. "

"Volume setting is prioritized as follows:

If any of the 5's are too loud or not loud enough, 2's take over (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 etc.)  
However, if 6 is good enough, than 5 is probably fine, so switch to that. Same goes for 4 usually.  
Odd numbers that are not part of the 5's are unacceptable, and should never be used (1, 3, 7, 9, 11 etc.)"

I walked out onto the sideline at the Rose Bowl (the stadium, not the event, although the event is held at the stadium) in the first half of a UCLA football game and watched the remainder of the game with the team and players.  I pretended to be on my phone and walked straight down and no one even gave me a second look.  I didn't know what to do during halftime, so I just stayed on the sideline and watched the halftime show with the band/cheerleaders.  Still, no one asked ""What the fuck are you doing out here?""  Stayed out there for the second half and saw UCLA win and ran across the field with the players and then found my friends, who all assumed that at any moment I was going to be arrested, and then left the game.

when I used to rent and I said that I'm moving out on a certain date... the power didn't go out on that date, they just stopped billing me. same thing for when you move in... when you go inspect the place even though nobody's lived there (no electricity account)... there's still power.

apparently the reason they can't just shut off power is that if you rely on electricity for life support, medical devices, etc... the power company can still be liable."

"I ran away from home at age 14 to join a band of animal activists that would tour with large wild cats, birds of prey, monkeys, and an elephant named Bubbles. (I left because I was severely bullied in school and didn't want to deal with it any longer)

I had to become a vegan while I was working with them and quickly discovered how cult-like the group was. The leader of the group was the Alpha and had multiple wives. The other males were very strange guys, and I don't think they were able to take girlfriends.

My job was the riskiest of all. I was essentially used as bait. All day I would prepare the meat for animal consumption, which would leave me smelling of beef and chicken guts. The uniform I was required to wear included a feathered hat. The lions and tigers were trained to be drawn to the feather. I was placed out in the crowd so the cats would look into the crowd. If any cat were to get free of their handler, they most likely would attack me rather than other guests because of my smell and the feather.

I ended up leaving the group and going home after a friends parent saw me at one event. Here is the picture she sent to my parents telling them what I was doing. http://imgur.com/pUDBfgc They came and convinced me to come home, where I slowly became unbrainwashed.

"The professional wrestling industry. I'm a big wrestling fan, always have been and as much as WWE (being the worlds #1 company) try to put out a crisp and coherent product, wrestling at its heart is a trick carnies used to run to scam ticket money out of carnival goers. It's a gypsy sport. 

Big wrestling fans know the stories from WCW in the mid 90's and ECW and WWF, but if you're not familiar you should read up about it. Learn about how Hulk Hogan would never let Randy Savage have a championship celebration without wanting the spotlight on him instead. Of course there is steroid abuse, inane conspiracies, nepotism, blackmail, bribery, financial laundering.

"I told a girl with severe depression that I loved her in a misled attempt to make her feel better once. She got wide eyed and stared to sob while telling me she loved me too and I was the best thing to have happened to her. Originally I had planned on ending it that night. 

Six months later I dump her, it was not pleasant. First, I'd chose a shitty day to do it from her point of view, terrible day at work and (seriously) it was a month before her birthday. She cried, which isn't so bad. Then she screamed, which was unexpected but manageable. Then she threatened suicide, which was terrifying after watching her struggle with depression. So we ""date"" another six months, which was more like me being held pusedo captive, until she met another guy.

"They're little parasites that travel through your intestines and lay eggs in your butthole. You mostly get them from eating feces (so children who don't properly wipe their butts get them a lot). They are nocturnal and the eggs hatch in darkness, so the worms mostly pop their little heads out at night, causing an itchy butthole. If you scratch your butt, you collect them under your finger nails and can transport them back to your mouth if you don't wash your hands again before putting your fingers on your lips or whatever. Then the process starts again and they lay eggs again.

Besides the itchy butt, I don't think there's a huge ailment that comes from having them, but it's still gross.

Edited to add that pinworms are also microscopic. When I was learning about them, they said the best way to test was to put a piece of scotch tape between the butt cheeks and take it to lab to go under a microscope.

2nd EDIT: I guess only the eggs are microscopic. Adult worms are visible. Suffice to say, I've never had them, or known if I did."

"She told me a story about how she once had a stalker that would stand in her backyard and stare at her through her window at night and call her and tell her he liked her bra, the color of it, etc. It got weirder when she took me out to her backyard to show me the ""exact spot"" where he was standing (even though she claimed to never have seen him). She told me many other wild ""facts"" (that she thought it was this guy that went to school with us but she wouldn't tell me his name, that she got letters from him claiming he was in love with her, things like that), but none of them added up and it was so completely obviously a lie. The final nail in the 2x4 was when I got a Facebook message from her mom on Facebook trying to convince me that her daughter was telling the truth when it was OBVIOUSLY HER that got onto her mom's Facebook and sent me the message.

I completely ended contact with her after that."

Would need work breaks so he'd grab a pole saw and go to town on random trees. Then he'd get bored and tell me to clear the piles he made and ""pretty the trees back up"".

"I worked at enterprise rent-a-car and there's a lot of scummy stuff done by that company, but the most common is called a ""rap slap"":

Basically you can get 4 types of coverage thru enterprise on your rental: Damage waiver (DW) covering any damage to the car, Supplemental Liability Policy (SLP) covering damage to any third party that you cause in the car i.e. Someone else's car, a fire hydrant etc, Personal Accident Insurance (PAI) covering medical bills up to $1mm, and Roadside Assistance Protection (RAP) basically enterprise pats for AAA or whatever roadside assistance you might need.

Now, most people have all of these things covered, and choose not to take any coverage, preferring to use what they already pay for (the DW is about $20 per day, if you get all coverage you're looking at up to $100 per day).  What you need to understand is that every employee at enterprise is in sales, but they don't make commission. Everyone there has sales targets to hit in order to simply keep their jobs, and the company turns a blind eye to the practice of rap-slapping.  Essentially, you tell the customer the total of their rental, including taxes and surcharges, is X when it is really Y, and you include the coverage on their bill without them knowing or consenting.  Some people will argue, and the employee will say they can ""work in a discount"" and will take the coverage away (insider tip, any enterprise employee can discount up to $100 without manager approval).

This sounds bad already, but it gets worse: the management, as well as other sales reps, train you on WHO to ""rap slap"": the elderly, people with a language barrier, people who've never rented before.

TL;DR: Enterprise Rent-a-Car employees hide unwanted insurance coverage on rentals in the tax, and typically pray on the elderly/people who don't speak English"

"Nude bodies. My family was always very casual about bodies. We lived near a pond where we would swim naked, if it was particularly  hot out we were all free to go topless without it being an issue, and none of this was ever even remotely sexual. I remember at young age being so shocked when I got in trouble for taking off my clothes to go swimming while I was visiting at a friends house. I remember being embarrassed and hurt because I didn't understand why they wanted me to cover up, not because of anything that actually had to do with my body. That was the first time I can recall feeling ashamed of my body. Being comfortable and familiar with nudity at a young age has helped me immensely in being, for the most part, content in my own body. I do have body image issues but those came later, I feel blessed that I was able to avoid them for the majority of my childhood "

"One of my girlfriends was dating this guy who was a human red flag. Untreated bipolar disorder, recovering alcoholic, on probation from prison for killing a guy in another country, a cousin was bringing child abuse charges on him for punching the cousin's young kid for being ""annoying"". My friend has a kid only 2 years older than the one he punched. Dude would smoke in her car even though my friend has asthma and he knew that. 


Dude had no job, a big trust fund from his rich, estranged family. He was morbidly obese, my friend was trying to stick with her strict diet following a lap band. He started isolating her from her friends by saying she was refusing to support him when she would go to parties where there was alcohol. He canceled plans with her (including an anniversary dinner she'd already arrived for) for WoW raids and guild meetings. 


She was much better educated than him, a bubbly, adventurous, employed and ambitious person and he was bringing her down. She didn't want to leave him because she felt like he needed the support and she felt responsible for him. He'd put her down and made her feel like she was stupid even though she's smart and was working at a think-tank startup that was incredible,  making beaucoup money and he sat at home watching Netflix documentaries. 


Now I only knew everything about him because I didn't live nearby so I was sort of a confidant. Her friends she saw often didn't know as much because she didn't want to bias them against him because he was obviously bad news. I constantly told her he was bad for her and her son, she eventually got engaged to him and didn't tell me. I was particularly worried her ex-husband was going to find out about his criminal history and use it to get custody of their kid. 



Finally she realized she'd let the relationship go too far and left him, showed back up and wanted to be friends again. Turned out everyone hated him as much as me even without the details I had but I was the only one honest enough to tell her. She found out her family and friends had been leaving her out of events because dude was unbearable. Her mom cried when she found out she didn't have to see him anymore. 


She's with a much better guy now and I make sure I show how supportive I am of her and her relationship. "

"We decided to have a sleepover at one of my friends because her parents weren't home. We decided to camp in the backyard because it's more fun and we can be as loud as we want without bothering the neighbors. You have to walk up on a hill to reach the end of the backyard which is separated from the forest with a tall fence. 

It was around 4AM and two of us were already in the tent and were about to sleep when suddenly my friend jumped in with an empty alcohol bottle and quickly closed the tent. She put her hand in front of her mouth signaling us to stay quiet and that's when we spot the shadow of a grown man. He went around the tent a few times then disappeared. Then someone started pulling up the tent zipper very slowly so the two of us started screaming bloody murder while the other friend who just jumped in was ready to fight the intruder with the empty alcohol bottle. The person stopped halfway then - i guess- went away. We stayed there a little still shocked from what just happened then decided to go outside to ""investigate"" because we were those stupid white girls who dies first in horror movies. 

No one was there, but the thing i still don't understand is how the person got in? We live in a safe neighborhood, but still each houses have massive fences. Let's say someone still decided to climb in...why would he chose a 10+ minute walk up a hill? We can't possible be seen from down there. Or let's say someone climbs in from the direction of the forest. We were only a meter away from the fence, and it makes a huge noise if someone tries to climb over. I'm sure there is an explanation but i still can't fully figure out. We were around 14 when this happened."

"Buddy of mine at work. Lost his job, wife, house, car, and any custody of his kid. All within a month. 

All because of drugs. His wife was so damn hot too. She kept telling him to straighten up. To quit weed and pills. And grow the fuck up.

They even had a kid while this was going on. And the sad thing is. She probably thought it would get him on track.

Now he lives with his parents in his old bedroom. I see him online everyday after I get off work on his ps4 playing cod.

I spoke to his dad that also works where he used to with us. And he told me his drug use has gotten worse. 

Such a shame. 

EDIT: I'm noticing alot of debate on whether weed is a drug problem or if she was just a bitch etc.

She smokes weed herself. She is about to graduate college as a nurse. While he barely makes it to work. Always either late or misses. And when he does show up. He wouldn't do shit. Only time you would see him move fast is to go out to his car at break to smoke weed.

"It certainly became a hot food trend that wasn't quite deserved. But it's still full of micronutrients, fibre, magnesium, and loads of calcium.

Eating it is definitely good for your health.

The overrated bit is in regard to it being deemed a 'superfood' that was on the lips of every health conscious shopper, meanwhile there's a dozen other leafy greens that are more nutrient dense than kale not getting mention.

It's not as if kale turned out to be iceberg lettuce though, which is nutritionally negligible.

Edit: after going deeper into this based on what u/local_moron had to say, it seems that the 'debunking' of kale as a superfood, or powerhouse food was based on the study published on the CDC website (linked in my comment below).

This one study was picked up by the media and they ran with it. The headlines were all written to dispel the hype around Kale, like 'Kale not such a superfood after all' and such.

The report claims watercress has 100% nutrient density since per gram its calorie count is less than say, kale per 100 grams, and it's micronutrient count is high. But this likely doesn't give a full picture.

Though it's peer reviewed and done by someone with a PhD in nutrition, it's just one study, with a methodology some find questionable.

Clearly, I'm no expert. The media did a good job spinning one study into universal acceptance, and I ended up doing the same.

The good news is Kale is still great after all. It's been my go to green for years, and my main point that eating it is good for your health despite what OP (u/jimsterlingpatreonic) wrote and 400 or so others agreed with, stands."

"This happens to also be the tale of how I came to realise I didn't really know my friends. 

It was our first campaign and I volunteered to be DM, putting many hours into developing the plot of a group of young adventurers being sent to a small island with high grey cliffs and a mysterious stormy setting. It was bound to be a good attempt at a campaign, especially considering how I had tried to adjust the choices available for my particular friends and their creative choices.

The campaign began with a small rowing boat arriving at the foot of some rotten and creaking stairs. The stairs spiralled way up the cliff and I really dramatised it. They were meant to be humble, worried and respectful.

The old blind man rowing the boat put out his hand in a gesture of payment, and I asked what the adventurers would like to do.

""We'll take his ore [oar].""

""Sorry?""

""Yeah, we take his ore [oar] and push him adrift. It's foggy and stormy right? Yeah we do that.""

""Okay, well he's blind so...do a strength check...14. The old man wheezes a little as he attempts to hold on to the slippery long oar. His hand are brittle and weak, so you yank it away with ease. The force makes him wobble as you push his boat slowly away. He stares in your direction with greyed over lost eyes. You see a single tear streak down each cheek as he slowly fades into the fog.""

""Throw the oar at him.""

""...uh I guess roll for strength again? Or accuracy I think?""

""18, that's a hit right?""

""The oar glides gracefully through the fog and hits him square in the forehead, knocking him unconscious and pushing the boat over the edge of your visible horizon.""

And well, after that point I realised I wouldn't be using my 8000 word plan and I didn't really know my friends at all. "

His wife was murdered by a serial killer. And no one thinks to look into his life?"

Yeah my first job was cleaning yogurt machines at a Baskin Robbins when I was 14 years old.   I had a low paying summer job every summer after that until I graduated college.

"I ran some numbers. I based my math on the M16, which may or may not be a current marine weapon, but is probably a pretty good guess for our purposes.

The effective range of an M16 is 800 metres when you're dealing with an area target (such as a crowd of 112,000 Brits). A decent-to-average 800m time is 3:15 (or 195 seconds). An M16 has 30 round magazines and takes at least 3 seconds to reload (by the best of the best). M16s fire fast, but can overheat, and as such usually aren't fired at full auto. Let's say that a marine can empty and replace his magazine in 8 seconds, which is generous because at that rate, for three minutes, the gun's going to overheat and break. There's a reason proper machine guns have replaceable barrels that you replace every few minutes.

Now, with 100 shooters, you're going to have some misses—not all shots are going to hit, and there's going to be a lot of overlap between targets. Let's say it takes five bullets, between misses and repeat shots, to kill one Brit.

(195 seconds)\*(30 shots per 8 seconds per man)\*(100 men)/(5 shots / kill) = 14,625 dead Brits

That's a lot, but consider that it's very optimistic, and it still leaves nearly 100,000 British soldiers who are just now starting to bayonet all 100 marines. Don't stick around to get bayoneted.

If the marines run, they will be outrun by the fastest 1% of the soldiers (marines are fast, but they're up against statistic here), which is 1120 British soldiers. They don't even need to bayonet them; if they're running away, they can just run within range and shoot them in the back. Assuming that the Brits didn't start by surrounding them with their force (which I remind you is over a thousand times larger) at a safe distance before charging).

Verdict: Decisive British Victory. God save the queen. Pick me as your lover."

"He also paid for my bar tab at an airport bar in the early/mid 90's, when he was still just a pro wrestler. I had no idea who he was. Had a five hour layover in St. Louis, so I found a quite bar near my forlorn gate (I was like in F terminal, where short-haul commuter flights were) and was just reading a book and downing a few beers when about 8 very loud and boisterous people came into the bar at around 9 PM. There were a couple of women too and they were all really big and muscular. I went to order another beer and The Rock told the bartender to put it and all previous beers on his tab, saying they must be driving me crazy. I told him it was cool, I'm on an expense account, and he said nonsense, I'm buying. OK, thanks man.  

Didn't even think much of it for years until one day I saw him on TV in some movie role and went ""Hey, that's the dude that paid my bar tab in St. Louis."" Nice guy."

I complained to Amazon and they gave me a full refund *and* let me keep the game for my trouble. Thank God for Amazon, always looking out for the little guy!""

EDIT: In case anyone was wondering, the guy bought the game from me and sent me an email the next day asking when to expect the package. I told him that the delivery window was 5-7 days from the date of purchase. He emailed me again two days later and asked why he didn't have the game yet. I told him to not email me again until after the anticipated delivery window had closed, or even begun. "

"Both ended the second world war early, and prevented a worse scenario for everyone. Operation Downfall (the naval invasion of the Japanese Home Island of Honshu) would have been a long, gruelling and dreadful war that could have spanned years and potentially resulted in far more death and displacement than the atom bombs. 

Even after the ordeal was finished, and Japan had surrendered, the Soviets would likely have also been able to launch invasions with the help of American naval power. This would likely have lead to a Vietnam/Korea type scenario with an East and West Japan, one aligned with NATO and the other with the Warsaw Pact/COMECON. "

"Former commission sales guy here. The body language tactics &amp; psychology behind the salesmanship is hugely underappreciated.

Most people know the simple tricks. *eg: Handshakes/appropriate physical touch, and calling you by name multiple times in the sale makes you all warm and fuzzy towards the sales guy.* But the rabbit hole goes *way* deeper than that, and most sales people don't even get this far (at least not on purpose), but the best ones will. I actually stopped using some of these when I sold because I didn't feel moral with how astoundingly effective some of them were.

**Mirroring:**

Gradually making hand gestures, copying speech patterns (eg: swear if they swear, use expressions they use, etc) and standing similarly to the customer. The PUA community latched onto this one too, so more people know about it, but it's simple and effective.

**Using gestures to inject thoughts/feelings:**

This one's subtle, and an extension of mirroring. They'll create a ""good space"", and a ""negative space"" with hand motions (as a simple example). They'll then associate things they want you to buy with the good space, and associate the bad space with things they don't want to deal with. So as an example:

\*Gestures left hand\* ""Ah, your Check Engine light lit up on the way here?! Ugh! I remember being stranded on the highway, it was awful.""

\*Gestures right hand\* ""On the upside, my father picked me up, and we had a *great* talk the whole way home! Turned out the fix was really simple too!""

\*Gestures left hand\* ""Now, I know your car is dead in the water...""

\*Puts right hand on the car he wants you to buy and runs his hand along the hood in the same motion as the gesture\*: ""But the good news is this beauty is right up your alley!""

It's best demonstrated in person/visually, but hopefully this gives a reasonable idea. It's obviously not as fast as the example above, but done in slow sequences throughout the whole sale, slowly, in baby steps, until you can literally start moving your ""good"" hand, and they immediately start nodding. I actually stopped using this one because I found it too manipulative.

**Big ol' goofy smile, no questions asked:**

We feel guilty when we say no to a very friendly person. A good sales person won't ask you ""How are you?"", or ""Can I help you with something?"". They'll just say ""HI!"" and smile until you get uncomfortable. If you respond with ""Just looking"" or something similar, they'll stick around, because they didn't ask you in the first place. They'll just play it off as a big friendly joke. ""Oh, that's cool! I love this one, it's so sleek. &lt;Begin sales pitch&gt;""

#**Over. The. Top. Language THAT WORKS AMAZINGLY:**

Setting politics aside, ever notice Trump's expressions? Everything is fantastic, amazing, and the best thing to happen to America since sliced bread. It sounds super corny, but that's because we're watching it from home, not mid-sale.

Face to face, I have no doubt this works for Trump. Lauding a customer's decision (the one you want them to make) with exaggeration pairs really well with the ""Big ol' goofy smile"" technique. The product they want is fantastic, their decision is fantastic, and so is this unnecessary purchase I want you to buy. They're all FANTASTIC.

If you've ever read cold copy on infomercials and ""free"" online webinars, etc, they're filled with ALL CAPS and flowery BUY NOW language. They usually have extra punctuation, similar to Trump's statements (eg: ""One. Hundred. Percent."")

IMO, this one's best for one-time sales, not for repeat business, so we see it less these days. Most companies realize customer retention is much more profitable than acquiring new ones, but this sales technique is still alive in many, many industries.

**The price match policy is a *closing technique*, not customer service:**

Ever notice when you go in with a prepared price match, a lot of stores will fight it tooth and nail? That's because it's not for you. It's for the on-the-fence customers who aren't sure about buying. Have no illusions: *The price match policy is almost always the same as their return policy*.

When you're on the fence, the sales person will reassure you that the price won't get any better by pointing to the policy. All they're really saying is ""Well, you can always get a refund later."" They know the refund is *way* more work for you than it is them, and statistically, once you're home, you're unlikely to keep looking around. Who keeps TV shopping a week after they bought a TV?

**Good sales people are *very* tightly scripted, and A/B test their pitches &amp; counters to objections:**

Most people *kind of* know this, because we've all dealt with bad coldcallers clumsily working through a sales script. But good sales is scientific as hell, and this is still true of in-person sales. You are the umpteenth iteration of a sales script they've recited over and over, and swapped out specific sentences (or even singular words) until they've found what works.

The skilled ones will keep track of objections made by past customers, and keep trying different counters until they find one that works for them most of the time. Most of the sale is spent pre-addressing common objections before you can ask, and they filter you into a logical conclusion where you have no objections left, before you've even made them. They'll make it sound like the answer to the objection was your idea too (See: Big goofy smile, no questions, above).

**My personal favourite: Most customers think marketing &amp; sales techniques work, but not on them**

I see it on reddit every day. I love how confident people are with this, because it's so demonstratively false. I wish I knew the psychological term for it, because it's one of my favourite cognitive dissonance examples in real life.

You are not immune. I promise. If you think critically, you *will* find examples of advertising and sales working on you. I promise.

* The body wash, shampoo, and deodorant I use are all due to brand recognition (ie: marketing) in my teens, when I moved out of the parents' house and had to start buying this stuff for myself for the first time.
* If you've ever gotten something at the impulse section at stores, that's another one.
* If you've ever ""found out"" about a sale on something from an employee, flyer, or just by browsing, and picked it up.

(Almost) *no one* goes into a store to ask for an extended warranty, a technician to do it all for them, or for 6 accessories for their $400 laptop or their used car.

"Strange about the sleep paralysis.  I really enjoyed it the first few times.  It was weird and interesting and I  liked that.  It gradually became terrifying.  I can never remember why it's so terrifying, but it's gotten to the point that whenever it happens I cry out for my parents (which comes out as a muffled moan since that's all you can manage) while it's happening.  And a couple of seconds after I snap out of it I slip back in.  This happens 5-10 times before eventually I force myself to sit upright and just don't go back to sleep for a while.  It's literally the worst feeling I've ever felt.

Edit: I should say, just to clarify how shitty this makes me feel, I'm 24 and live by myself, and yet I still cry out for my parents when this happens.  Many times I legitimately think I'm dying.  I try to sleep on my side as much as possible, and when my mind is clear, I'm very aware it's harmless.  I'm just not in control of my thoughts when this happens it seems."
"Not sure if this is creepy, but when I was in my first and second year of high school I would always have to ride the bus home. A man would always approach me and tell me to make weird faces whenever I arrived at the second station. He seemed friendly enough and I was too shy to step away from him. Then after a while he started telling me to lean closer to him, but I never did fearing what would happen if I did. He offered me candy from his bag and showed me really crude drawings of himself. He then started talking about my family asking questions if my boyfriend was alright. I never gave him any info about my life and the fact that I recently started dating someone just made me feel unsettled. After that I dreaded taking the bus home. In my third year of high school, I told my friend about it. He looked shocked and asked me what his name was. I replied and he said, ""But did you do the things he asked you to do? You do realize he gets off to this kind of stuff, right? He's a pervert. We had to deal with him a lot during my volunteering at the station."" My heart began to sink and started to think about the times if I had fully complied what would have happened to me."

"The thing is, Japan's perception of white-washing is totally different than Asian-Americans over here.  Because they live in a place where the only people represented in their media are people like them.  So for them, it's no problem, since they don't feel underrepresented at all.  Why would they care if a white chick plays Motoko Kusanagi?  They've got a million other shows with asians in them.  It'd be like asking a white person here if they care that the Kingpin was black.  

It's different for people in the west where they almost never see anyone like them on TV, and when they do, it's usually a stereotype or a minor character that's not particularly respectable.  Name me more than a handful of asian characters who:

A) Aren't stereotypical nerds

B) Don't do martial arts

C) Aren't a ""comedy"" character with humor in some way related to their race

D) End up ""getting the girl"" -- especially a white girl

Any Seth Macfarlane show is pretty bad about it in general -- going all the way back to one of his college shorts where he had an asian man servant.  Their whole writing team has a hard on for asian jokes.  I'm the last person to give a fuck about political correctness, and nothing against Seth personally, but some of the ones I see on Family Guy and American Dad are pretty cringy.  Then again, most of the writing on those shows are pretty meh these days (especially compared to the early seasons of FG).    

People saying ""See?  These asians don't care if white people are playing eastern characters."" are sort of missing the point.  "

I am shamefully a furry who owns a suit. And you know what? Im still closeted, and refuse to wear it anywhere besides cons and indoors or somewhere Im invited in it. However, the BF loves the thing cause Im like a 6ft4 blanket with it, so we wake up one day and watch netflix while Im suited up. Ge loves to cuddle and all, and we're sitting there and the poor 67 year old maid freaks out cause shes terrified of horses. Drops everything and sprints out as fast as her frail legs could manage and takes off. A phone call and explination later, and everything is cleared up. Now she knows and even asks when she comes over if she can ""pet the horsey"" sometimes. Thankfully though, got her over her fear of horses. So Id guess thats good.

"I am wondering if you are asking about a relationship you know of/maybe your own relationship?

Sometimes people become anxious that their relationship is unsalvageable or different from others because of x or y circumstance. Very often, I see relationships like these and feel they are more a symptom of one persons anxiety about being with the other person as opposed to a rule or general set of guidelines about relationships. 

To answer your question directly, there will be relationships that are going to be a serious challenge to make work, especially those where both parties are unable to flex and compromise or understand the other persons position. When I see these couples, I am trying to help one or both of the people see this is the true underlying issue, not whatever they think is the issue. e.g - its not that he doesn't do the dishes or that she is always nagging him. 

Where both parties are genuinely trying to resolve differences, build bridges, reach closeness and intimacy/trust, I have seen so many couples really do amazing work and get over massive hurdles and differences.

I hope this answers your question - feel free to elaborate or explain where I am misunderstanding you though! "

"All of your ""natural"" labels on food are a scam. They mean nothing and have almost zero regulation on how they're used. Then there's organic produce which has been proven time and time again to be nutritionally indistinguishable from non-organic counterparts. Organic farms are not better for the environment. There are simply good farm practices and bad farm practices. Plenty of non-organic farms have better and safer practices than many organic farms. 

It's all basically a scam to sell overpriced food to wealthy people who've bought into a lifestyle that has been heavily marketed to make them think their purchases make them a better, healthier person.

 I work in agriculture. I'm a researcher for a university but I've worked on non-organic and organic operations. I don't want to make blanket statements, so I won't say that ALL organic farms are this way or that way. It depends on the management. However, from my experiences and research, organic farms are heavy wasters of resources. I worked on one organic farm that was the pinnacle of the ""eat, grow local"" community and movement. Everyone in the area knew our farm and we sold produce at farmers markets and local organic groceries.

Our farm wasted hundreds of man hours, water, soil, and other resources to produce plants that simply weren't as tough. We'd lose huge chunks of our produce to insect pests and diseases that could be easily managed on a non- organic farm. Just to produce a vegetable that feeds a person exactly the same. We used more inputs to produce lower quality crops, which we then charged triple for and sold out at the farmers markets.

We threw out hundreds of pounds of perfectly good cucumbers because they had bite marks from cucumber beetles on them and the organic stores wouldn't sell a marked cucumber. Our grow tunnels would get infested and we could throw down powdered clay and other repellents but they hardly worked. If we pulled out stunted potatoes, they'd be sold as ""gourmet baby potatoes"" at $5 a pound! Some of our produce was beautiful, but a ton was crap and even more was thrown out. 

Organic farms also use a shit ton of plastic to cover the ground and manage weeds since they can't use herbicides. The edges of the plastic get pushed deep in the ground, and we could never dig it all out. The earth gets filled with plastic, a bunch of it would end up in the river, and the rest of the plastic would get torn up after harvest and put in a landfill.

There's also the issue of livestock. Organic, antibiotic-free, livestock can never be treated for infections with medicine because their value drops way down as they could no longer be sold as organic. If you have to treat a dying animal, you might as well just send it straight to market after because it's not useful in your herd. Animals also weren't vaccinated against everything they should have been because a lot of the people buying our meat were anti-vaccine. This meant our animals got sick and then we made them suffer, waiting to see if they'd get better on their own so we wouldn't have to treat them with antibiotics or other banned medicines. Some of them got better. Some of them we treated and immediately sold at a fraction of the price to market. And some of them we waited too long and they died. Horribly inhumane and unethical. Witholding medicine from sick animals so people can pat themselves on the back when they eat an antibiotic-free burger. 

Seriously, fuck organic and the managers who sell the lifestyle and pander to the rich and ignorant. I bet there are a lot of great organic farms out there that are responsible and productive, but being ""organic"" has absolutely nothing to do with it. It's all about management

TLDR; organic food is a scam to sell overpriced, often lower quality food at a greater cost to society and our natural resources. Organic =/= higher quality food, safer practices, humane treatment of animals, or environmentally friendlier practices."

Nearly every young lady that I was introduced to in his presence became a topic of his concern shortly after ( in private). ""Hey, what do you think of [lady]?"" And sure enough, for each object of his interest came the later secretive confession: ""Hey, you know [said lady]? I slept with her.""

I'm certain he embellished his sexual activity, but the demeanor of those same ladies thereafter (esp. in his presence) did indicate some veracity to his tawdry comments.

On a personal note, while I was with a girl at the time, I still found his behavior disheartening. It was like he was managing his own personal zoo, and he was parading its subjugated inhabitants in front of me like a renaissance merchant."

"Pretty much everything in Yakuza Zero. 

Main story is you playing as this pair of super bad arse gangster types in a really interesting, quite complicated plot about control of real estate in 1980s Tokyo as a backdrop to an inter-gang war. 

The side stories have you doing things like escorting Michael Jackson while he stars in a Steven Spielberg-directed music video, accidentally stumbling into a kidnapping situation while thinking you were going to get laid, or helping a bitter old yakuza understand what it means to be a good father by beating the shit out of him for a video game. 

It's pretty amazing. "

"PRO TIP FOR BUSINESS OWNERS DEALING WITH YELP SOLICITORS

Yelp employees don't know your voice. When they call, put on your perkiest retail employee voice and say the following: 

""Oh, $owner's not in/in a vendor meeting/talking with a customer! Here, let me grab some paper, what's your name and extension so they can call you back?"" 

*Actually write that stuff down,* repeat it back to them, give them an email address and let them know the owner will get in touch when they can, and when they hang up, throw the paper out and make a filter to shuffle anything from @yelp.com into your inbox's trash bin.

Yelp's call center employees only last a few months at most; Yelp's corporate structure puts impossible sales goals on them so only a rare few ever get full time work. They don't seem to keep updated records on correspondence, so you can keep using the same script over and over again when you invariably get a phone call from someone new. 

The **first time** they call, screenshot the reviews on your Yelp page.

Instruct your employees to do the same."

Some hard times there, for compassionate people like me who's heart would break a little more each time.

"I was 19, Woke up in horrendous pain at 2am, my boyfriend at the time drove me to the hospital about 15 minutes away. I would smoke a cigarette and light a new one with my old one as it was the only way I could breathe. A sharp pain in my left side that felt as though I was being stabbed with a butcher knife. 

Boyfriend starts to panic as I think I'm having a heart attack, doesn't pay attention or care about speed limits. 

Cop is sitting at a well known speed trap about a mile from the hospital.
Boyfriend panics harder with a cop car behind us. He thinks I'm dying. I think I'm dying.
He decides to try to make it to the hospital and maybe explain later, I don't know.

The hospital is on a hill, and it's set up to where if you make a right you're going to the hospital, you make a left you're on the highway. We're at the bottom of the hill and there's now 3 police cars behind us, one of them clips the back of the car and we stop.

I'm mad at my boyfriend but also grateful to him that we made it.
I'm looking at my boyfriend in shock since this shit situation just got even shittier and I hear my door open so I turn around and it's a police officer and he's got the barrel of his gun to my forehead. I'm holding my side in agony and grasping at my chest and throat trying to get a satisfying breath.
I start begging for my life. I'm crying. I keep repeating that something is wrong with me and I need help. They keep yelling at me. I'll either die by my body failing or a bullet to the head. I truly felt like I had no way out and I was going to die. Scariest moment of my life.
Boyfriend tries telling them, they slam him against the car and arrest him on 7 charges.

"Not a lawyer, but something I saw on Facebook that made me laugh.

Someone I went to school with went to a children's clothes shop in the city centre to buy clothes for her son. She took the tags off the clothes and threw away the receipt. When she got home, she realised that the clothes were too small for her son. She brought them back, demanding a refund. The manager refused, citing store policy that you have to have the tags and receipt in order to get a refund. She then took a picture of the manager, two cashiers and the security guard of the shop and put them on Facebook along with their names. She wrote a very long, ranty Facebook post claiming that she was entitled to a refund under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act. The Act lists the various criteria needed in order to get a refund, replacement or repair of the item you bought. One of them states that the item must be ""fit for purpose."" It basically means that the item you buy should be able to perform the action it is meant to (so if you buy a hair dryer that doesn't dry hair, you would be entitled to a refund, replacement or repair). You learn this in your very first year of secondary school. She was claiming that because the pair of jeans she bought for her son didn't fit him, they were not fit for purpose. Despite a metric fuck tonne of comments telling her that *that's not how the law works*, she couldn't see her misinterpretation and just kept repeating ""but... they don't fit my son!"" It was hilarious and sad at the same time."

"Child of divorce here.

My father was a plastic surgeon. Worked his way up from a janitor at a hospital that didn't graduate high school to getting through med school mid 30s. Married my mom in his 40s (she was 20 years younger). They always had a strained relationship. He was a workaholic and also had a drinking issue. My mother on the other hand was controlling and manipulative. I could see both of their issues at a young age. 

I always knew they needed to be separated but it didn't happen until my early 20s which couldn't have been a worse time. My dad had lost a considerable amount of money after the recession and had also gotten 2 types of cancer (prostate and colon) and almost died and pretty much stopped practicing medicine. My mother decided this was the perfect time to divorce him and in the process take every little thing could from him including my younger siblings. He fell into a deep depression and still to this day thinks he loves this woman while she continues to take advantage of him. 

I managed to help him win back his house in court but he lost every other bit of cash and property. 

A real shit storm. Still dealing with it 3 years later

Edit: before any backlash about taking sides in the divorce start flooding in...i know it's my mother and I shouldn't take sides but she did some horrible things to my family. It's taken years to recover from and while it wasn't all her fault she was the primary catalyst in the situation and didn't have to be spiteful and take every little thing from a man who gave her everything."

"I found the post I wrote to accompany the picture. :)

My parents own a film company, and for a while we had a lot of jobs involving the Delta Blues. Morgan Freeman owns a Blues bar in Clarksdale, so that's how we met. I actually had no idea he was going to be at my house, so imagine walking into your living room in a tie-dye shirt and shorts and finding the Freeman standing next to your coffee table. I've always been pretty outgoing, though, so I shook his hand and introduced myself.

It wasn't long until he looked over my shoulder and noticed the chess table on the hearth. ""Do you play?"" he asked. You know that dream where you go into a class you didn't remember taking, and the teacher starts passing out a test you hadn't studied for? Similar feeling.

I don't really remember the specifics of the game. I played pretty aggressively, and I don't think he took me seriously to begin with, which was to his credit, because who tries to crush an eleven year old in a chess game?

Anyway, there was a moment that definitely stuck with me, the second time I checked him. He looked down at the board, back up at me, and smiled. Then he said, ""I was not expecting brilliance.""

Then he totally destroyed me. He's a really damn good chess player, okay? We talked a little bit after the game, and my dad got one last picture of us. I was over the fucking moon after what he said, obviously, but he gave me some advice when I posed with him.

"Oh so every time they say, one time we will actually kill you? This is gonna sound really naive but after a few times wont you be used to it. I know that sounds stupid but if they do the same thing every time, its just mental torture, not physical."
"He had kinda been a jerk the whole relationship. Couldn't take the blame for *anything*, tried convincing me that my parents didn't love me, told me who I couldn't hang out with, told what I could and couldn't wear, and I would only go to his house because he ""felt discriminated against"" in my house due to the fact my parents hated him (in retrospect, for very good reason). 

Then, on our seven month anniversary, he proposed to me. In his dirty car. In a mall parking lot on the bad side of town. My reaction was kind of like my life flashing before my eyes before death, except it was my future. I saw snippets of a shitty, sad, abusive future with him. So I flat out said no, took the ring from his hands, shoved it in his center console, and told him to take me home. He was *livid.* That's when shit got scary, and fast. Instead of driving me back home, he drove to the neighbourhood nearest mine and started driving through the cul-de-sacs at 45mph, punching his steering wheel, and spewing obscenities at me. I told him over and over again, take me home, dammit! But he wouldn't. It was mortifying. 

Finally, after an hour of sheer terror, he parked at the empty lot at the end of my street and asked me what was going to happen. For the last time, I told him he was going to take me the fuck home. So he roared up my street crying and yelling, and as soon as I bust his car door open, he tried to pull me back in. He was much larger and stronger than itty bitty me, and he was using all his strength to force me back inside and I was using all of mine to get away. I knew that if I got back inside that car, I would never get back out alive. All the way to my garage he was following me, crying, forcing his arms around me to pull me back into his car. I don't know how, but by the grace of higher powers, I was able to pry away from him, open my garage, and close it with him on the other side, punching the door as it went down. 

A month later I noped the fuck to the other side of the country. I blocked him and his shitty family on every social media site and blocked their numbers, too. He had told me he would kill me if I ever tried to leave him, and that night easily could've been it."

"I've seen children with terrible disorders. Like this one kid whose skin falls off at the slightest touch. Everything he does is incredibly painful. And it isn't likely he's gonna live a very long life.

However, the kid wants to live. Wants to fight for every second, despite all the pain. He makes plans for the future, a future he won't have and he knows it. But it doesn't matter. He wants to go on and he will continue living his very painful life till the last day.

Most people would say that's no life at all. Most people say that they wouldn't want to live like that. But once you're in the situation, and you only have the choice between going on or giving up, many people will want to survive.

I don't know what that child in your story would have wanted. At 11 months he will not be able to tell. But I find ""let him die with dignity"" to be something one can't truly decide for anyone. For all they know, the boy might have wanted to live, despite his terrible quality of life."

"If anyone is interested in Freelance writing, PM me. 

My one piece of advice would be to **start small**. Most importantly, just start. But trying to go big fast will just leave you feeling burnt out. 

I started as a freelance writer for a small marketing firm making ~$15-25/hr depending on my motivation that day. At first, I was writing for some small freelance sites and stuff I found on craigslist. I never went to a bigger site like [WritersAccess](https://www.writeraccess.com/careers/) or [Scripted](https://www.scripted.com/)... While I don't have anything against thoses sites, I guess it just seemed like they were hiring for career writers and I was just beginning. But if you do have some experience, those aren't bad sites to go to. 

After I had built up a portfolio of content (100+ pieces of content ranging from small blogs to in-depth articles), I started reaching out to small marketing firms in my city, asking if they were interested in an in-house writer. I got a few interviews and made a decision. 

I ended up getting in on the ground floor and now work in the office. But we currently have about 200 writers working from home (not all of them are active). 

We basically find people online or through friends of current writers and give them some sample writing (which we pay them for assuming it is of quality). If their sample writing looks good, we add them to our list of writers. Then, emails go out each week with projects to be completed and you can grab them if you like, or pass them up if you're not interested. 

I'd say most of our writers write in spurts, taking lots of projects during weeks when nothings going on (winter, non-holidays, etc.), and then slowing down during the summer months and big holidays. 

It's not the best gig in the world, but if you do it consistently, you can start making decent money. **Plus, you get to wear your pajamas.**"

There have been too many times in my past where speaking my mind, even over the slightest thing, has led to me being berated and belittled for being ""wrong"" in my opinion, so sometimes asking me more than twice (which is a pain in the arse for people and something I am working on) is the reassurance and push I need to know that somebody genuinely wants to understand what I'm thinking, and hopefully won't tell me I'm pathetic or useless..."

Had a friend in college, we'd talk about some really weird stuff together. Like really weird. One day he was asked me, ""Dude, do you ever just like go through your Facebook friends list and just masturbate to a picture of a girl you like or just whatever hot chicks you have added."" It became a ""WTF? No!"" Fast-forward two weeks, and we were discussing manscapping. It came up that I have never shaved my balls and that I just had this absurd mound of hair in my pants. Facebook Masturbator has the audacity to call me weird.

Fast-forward another week, parents went out of town for a week. Had the house to myself. I'd go on these stints of non-stop gaming whenever they went out of town. Went out back to have a smoke and started torching leg hair for no reason. Thought it smelt interesting and got rid of hair quick. Thinking...Thinking...Thinking...Thought it would be a great idea to just torch my pubic hair away! After a week of not showering my crotch was this oily putrid mess of hair...and when I brought the lighter to my crotch the hair caught fire and I started running around my backyard beating my dick trying stop the fire...I decide now that my pubes are a charred mess I have to trim them. I go into my parents bathroom looking for some small scissors to get to work with. Start trimming right into the sink. Almost done and the sink is full of hair and I hear the garage door open. I was under-age at the time, and I had a lot of alcohol out. I'm running around my house butt-ass naked with a freshly trimmed crotch trying to hide everything that shouldn't have been happening while my parents were away. Everything is hidden and at the last second I realize...FUCK!! There is a sink full of my pubes in my parents bathroom! In a panic I run into the bathroom and turn on the faucet and try to wash it down the drain. All the hair just becomes a massive glob and gets stuck in the drain. I hear the lock on the garage door turning and I panic even more. I proceed to unclog this mass of pubic hair from the drain with my hands and just ended up hiding it in a trashbag."

"I hope this gets buried but I genuinely want to tell my friend to stop whining and complaining about every hardship she experiences in her young adult life. Everyone struggles in their own way. She is 25 and has everything going for her. Smart, pretty, strong, funny, etc. She's just slow to start. But for the past couple of years, she has changed and not in a very positive way. She suddenly thinks it is okay to put her problems and only her problems on a pedestal to ""oh you poor baby"" over while anyone else's problems are minuscule in comparison (and those problems for some are 10x worst than hers, literally life or death). She has become selfish, inconsiderate, and worst of all WHINEY. Also, recently, she is becoming an alcoholic. There. I said it. She relies on alcohol as an emotional crutch for her problems. I've been there for her for all of her rough patches and have always consoled her when she starts losing her shit. Now, I'm beginning to resent being her friend as we've gotten older because of how negative and ungrateful she is becoming. We've been really close for at least a solid 5+ years (college pals). I just wish I could say all of these things to her without jeopardizing our friendship (because really she can't handle any type of critique or criticism of her behavior or actions). It feels oddly relieving telling strangers my super silly and mostly petty white people problems. "

"This question assumes a very human kind of self-love. If you consider God the basis for all morality, and humans as a distorted version of the image of God, you'll realize that there are things that God can do in purity that we would mess up every time. If God is perfect and holy and all-powerful, he *should* love Himself as the supreme definition of good.

For a human to demand love would be narcissistic and foolish, because we are not perfect. Therefore, we assign narcissistic motivations to a perfect God for expecting our honor and worship.

Does that make sense? I know it isn't persuasive as a reason to believe, but hopefully it helps you picture how God can command honor if he truly exists as the one who defines all of these things to begin with."

Both of us were the eldest sibling, both loved the same music, had the same views on things, etc. On the 30 minute bus ride on the way to the party, we decided to play a game to see who could go the longest without smiling since I have a reputation for being serious and intimidating. It started out with us saying knock knock jokes trying to get the other to laugh until he started pointing out little things about me like ""I like how you tuck one side of your hair behind your ear but not the other"" and ""Your shoes look like little pillows on your feet and I want to take a nap on them"" to ""I think its funny how you roll your eyes and smile every time someone says something humorous but you don't want to give them credit for it"". I started to blush pretty heavy at this point and easily lost the game because I kept smiling. He ended up being an excellent dancer and I had a great time with him.

Sadly, he graduated from my university a month later but I still have a crush on him when I think about how he saw the little things about me more clearly than most of my friends. "

And you had to wear that (thin) kit, no matter the weather, even when it was below freezing in the middle of winter. I had some bad lungs as a teen, and the attire wasn't doing them any favours (I'd have days of coughing afterwards as a result). I tried to bring a tracksuit instead. Guess what?

Then there was the days he took us blackberry picking, to the beach at low tide to help dig up worms so we could go fishing later. I still remember him teaching me how to gut, clean and cook a fish.

Never realized how much he taught me until I bought my own fixer-upper house with a husband that never touched a tool in his life. Point being, its things like that that will stick with your kid. Hope this helps.

"Hunting on Thanksgiving, 2015. 

I was at my in-laws house for Thanksgiving in NW Montana. They live about 60 miles south of the Canadian border. They are what I would call comfortable survivalists, and live waaayy off the grid. No TV. No cell reception, too far up in the mountains for that. Great people, just don't like towns. (My wife was home schooled). You get the idea. 

I decided I would go for a morning deer hunt on Thanksgiving. It's a great location for it, as they are right in the middle of prime deer, elk, and bear country. Their house borders national forest land on 3 sides, so pretty easy to find yourself in the middle of nowhere, because you're already there. 

My FIL insists I leave the house at the butt-crack of dawn. (Where I hunt the deer don't start moving around until 8 to 9 am.) But of course I agree with him and head out before light. 

I've got a head lamp on, walking down a narrow trail in thick coverage and can see about 10ish feet in front of me. It's super cold but no snow. Dark as hell. 20 miles from the nearest town. FIL says before I left that about 20-25 minutes hike you'll come to a small curved valley that is a newly finished logging project. Perfect area for deer hunting as there is minimal coverage and you can see about a mile down the valley. 

The trail meets up with a rugged logging road. As I keep walking I can start to see large slash piles from this logging project all over the place. I find a good spot over this little valley to sit and listen. 

As I'm sitting there and it's getting light, I'm looking all around me for deer. To my right about 200 yards away there is a slash pile with something moving on or around it. I pull out my little binos and look. There is a deer with its legs in the air, covered in dirt and blood. I start to feel the hair on my neck straighten out. The deer disappears inside the pile of branches and then I see a mountain lion come out from the pile, nose red with blood. He scrapes all around the area for a few minutes. I'm guessing he smelled or sensed me, because he was walking around in little circles and looking up in the air. I didn't know what the hell to do. I kind of panicked because they are very territorial and will definitely attack people. So me being the cool guy I am, fired my gun in the air and walked back to my in-laws place in circles. I did see the lion run off, but still. That was the scariest walk I've ever been on! 

And of course played it cool when I got back. Told my wife what happened that night. "

"I can give anecdotal evidence of this regarding child manipulation. When I was young I was always told my father left while me and my brother were in diapers.

Word got back to my dad, and they exchanged letters through cousin. Turns out my mom had been using us as bargaining chips to get more child support, and when my dad couldn't pay she kept moving so he couldn't find us. He had been looking for years. Was less than a year later I walked out of my home and moved in with him. We have an awesome relationship now. "

There's Something Wrong With Aunt Diane - the story of Diane Shuler and the Tetonic Parkway wreck. 

The Natural History of the Chicken - I can't explain how good this is. It's artfully filmed and produced. It's maybe an hour long and absolutely delightful.

The fact that I didn't say anything clued my daughter in and I could tell she was psyched that her 42yo Dad really enjoyed it.

"I see what you mean. However, I work with children who are on the autism spectrum and I would say that even with a high high-functioning individual, there are going to be things that affect them socially and educationally. That being said, if the level of diagnosis is analyzed and explained properly, then the child will be able to recognize where they need a little extra help. If nothing is explained to that child, then they might go on wondering what is wrong with them if people treat them differently in any areas of their life - such as social connections. I would say that it's worse to not know than to know in any situation like this. 

Furthermore, children who have autism get IEP meetings in order to assess their needs for assistance in school and and also for in-home services. Did this child not have any IEP meetings or professional opinions in regards to his neurological condition? If not, that sounds like the parents not taking charge and just ignoring the fact that their child has autism. That as a whole could set back the child educationally and socially in so many ways, which is horrible to think about."

"Originally she was awarded custody of all 3 of us. After 3 or 4 months, my older sisters decided they hated her new husband and went back to live with our Dad. I'm much younger, so they left me behind. After a few years, my mother and 1st stepfather (she's been married a bunch) moved out of state with me and my youngest stepbrother. Mother dearest would talk to my sisters on the phone about an hour on an average of once a week. Once every month or so, she would give me the phone and the timer so we could ""say hi"". Now that I'm older, I realize now that she was terrified of my telling them about how much her 2nd husband drank (he was a Minister) and how much he beat the shit out of his youngest son (who was mentally retarded). I ran away from home after my stepbrother was accepted into a group home and didn't need me anymore. Then my Dad finally found me and brought me back home. I call that woman my ""birth mother"" because that's what CPS called her once they finally got involved. I also have an awesome new mother-figure now who makes Mary Poppins look like a bag o' dicks.

"After 5 years, I never truly felt like she was the one. I enjoyed being with her, but I never really saw myself marrying her or spending the rest of my life with her. After she dumped me, I kinda felt relieved that it was finally over. I was still pretty broken by how everything happened and what she did to me, but I was never truly upset about the breakup, more that she left me to go sleep with someone else. 

I think the moment that really made me realize that she wasn't the one was when she criticized me for not drinking. I don't drink and she didn't either, toward the end of our relationship she starting hanging out with ""party girls"" and began drinking a lot. She got mad at me for not wanting to drink even though she was well aware that I came from a broken childhood with an abusive alcoholic father. "

But they're *pizza*. And you can make them on the go, or at home, or when you don't have much time. The base bread is bad, yes, but it comes with actual pizza sauce, decent shredded cheese, and pepperonis. Again, not *good* ingredients, but they're alright. And, depending on the kind you get, they might come with a crunch bar. All for like a buck.

Compared to any sort of real, cooked food, lunchables are pretty gross. But if you compare them to, like, a packed sandwich that's been coagulating in a paper bag since 7 in the morning, they're not bad. And a lunchable with *pizza sauce*? Get that sandwich the fuck outta here. "

"I was struck by lightning, at a Boy Scout camp, which I find rather shocking.

Every time I mentioned this as my ""fun fact"" for highschool or college, people instantly called BULL. Needless to say, I often had to send people links to the local or national news coverage of the Boy Scout camp I was at. (https://www.google.com/amp/boston.cbslocal.com/2013/06/24/nh-boy-scouts-hospitalized-after-lightning-strike/amp/ )

I have pictures of me recovering in the ER on my cloud drive (at work) and I'll post them on imgur when I get home. I have spiderweb burns on my heart and on my arms and feet.

Here's what happened:

I went to a National Youth Leadership Training camp for Boy Scouts in June of 2013. On the first full day of camp, we were coming back from a mud training course and went to hit the showers. While showering my fellow campers and I heard the campwide alarm go off. We all rushed to get changed as quick as we could but then we heard a knock on the door telling us that this was only for the main camp and that we were not to respond to this drill because we are in a seperate program.

When we got back to our campsite, we got ready for dinner (you have to wear full uniform) and we're gathering around our metal tables that were set up in this classroom-style setting under a tarp with metal folding chairs surrounding the tables. About 2 minutes later there is a huge breeze and the sky turns from bright and clear to the darkest sky I've ever seen. It was darker than a normal night, and the clouds flickered with an ominous glow. At this point the coordinator for our campsite (we were one of 3) tells the ~30 scouts and 3 adults to gather under the tarp to wait out the rain. The wind picks up heavily and then we are told that if a direction is yelled to run in that direction because trees are in danger of falling. Several seconds later everything stops. Things really do go in slow motion... It's really weird.

All of a sudden I hear everyone start screaming this blood curdling scream and I'm locked into my chair which is nudged up against this tree. I don't remember passing out, but I remember the screams echoing as they got louder and I felt an intense heat course through my veins and my hair stand on end. It sounded like someone shot a gun next to my ear, however, it was so loud I went deaf. The blinding light streaked through my vision and I felt myself fall forward onto the metal table and bump my chest against the metal rim, sending another wave of heat through me.

I was blind for ~ 1-3 minutes and deaf for about 5 but eventually eberyone came down; then we noticed our scars. Instantly an emergency call was made and myself and ~6 other kids were rushed to the lobby of main camp to be evaluated because we had the worst scarring (mine was over my heart, and I was having trouble breathing). I only remember that I had a temperature of 100.7 F and that my heart was racing (because why would it not after hundreds if thousands of volts?). 

I'm rushed to the hospital, many tests are done, and I'm released at 3am (roughly 9 hours later). In the end 26 scouts went to the ER that night and all of us were very, VERY lucky. The worst of us have PTSD and even with that I'm thankful every day that I'm still alive.

Edit: please note that the news media failed to cover this story accurately for almost 5 days. None of us were airlifted, none of us died, and twenty three scouts and three adults were hospitalized. They were far too much in a rush for a good story about a boy scout camp that they were ready to watch people sue the pants off of. It never happened. The camp did us all justice and helped us out tremendously. "

"On mobile. Sorry for any grammar and spelling mistakes.   First. My heart and thoughts are with the people of London tonight. My story is not intended to minimize or play on the horrors they are experiencing.   In June 2005, I was solo backpacking Europe. I was in London and had an early morning flight to Rome. I was on the tube in a car by myself around midnight-1am. Suddenly, the door between cars opened and 3 Middle Eastern men wearing coats and backpacks step inside my car. They all stared at me then got into a huddle and whispered with a few more glances in my direction. I became hyper aware of being a petite female alone, but, they thankfully walked to the next car. As I was processing how weird that was, it occurred to me that it wouldn't take much to put something in a backpack and disable the train and then I had another thought that they almost seemed to be casing it.  I realized I was being really racist and paranoid because these men had every right to be there, and even though I had crazy bad vibes from them, it was probably all in my head. But it just felt weird.  I wondered if I should say something to someone but I figured it's not illegal to walk between train cars and stare menacingly at girls then keep walking.   I get on my plane to Rome a few hours later and when I arrived, I turned on my phone and found a ton of missed calls making sure that I was safe. There were multiple explosions in the London Underground that morning. One was on the same line I was on and when the men entered my car, we were coming up to one of the stations that was hit.   Most likely, I'm a paranoid racist, but I still wonder if I saw some sort of last minute trial run. Frankly, I kind of hope it was me being stupid because I hate to think I could have spoken up and maybe stopped something horrific. "
"I grew up in a small town that had one bookstore, the Waldenbooks at the mall. I was a huge sci-fi fan as a kid (and now, actually) and every time we went to the mall I'd go to Waldenbooks to see if maybe hope against hope they'd stocked some books by Harlan Ellison or Isaac Asimov. You could try to order a specific book that you wanted, but if it was out of print or Waldenbooks didn't carry it, you were out of luck. The library sometimes could get things through inter-library loan but they were limited too.

My point being, there were a lot of books that I just didn't have the ability to get my hands on. When I ordered my first couple of books from Amazon in the late 90s, it seriously felt like the Wright Brothers discovering flight or something. I was just overcome by awe -- I wasn't limited by what the library or the bookstore had in stock anymore, I could order ANYTHING and it would come right to my door.

This is something that my kids definitely take for granted. They have grown up in a world where pretty much any consumer good you want can be delivered to your door within days. And if you want to read a particular book, you can just download it to your Kindle in less than a minute. Life-changing."

So I gave it to her and said, ""I'm sorry, I only have $29. Let me go to the ATM to get cash."" I was secretly hoping she would say, ""It's fine, it's just a dollar!"" because I knew the only ATM in the building from a bank I didn't have an account with. Also, the prices were at her discretion - she didn't have a set cost for any type of alteration and she didn't even tell me how much each type of alteration cost, just that the jacket was a little pricey due to the lining. I checked in my car for any coins and found nothing. I had no choice but to withdraw and I was charged $3 by the ATM and $2 from my own bank. When I came back, she said, ""Never mind! It's just a dollar!"" Apparently she didn't hear me last time when I said ""I only have $29..."" So I literally spent $5 to withdraw money I didn't need."

He took me into his truck, blindfolded me, shoved me in the back, and drove me to his house, where he brought me to the basement. He stripped my clothes off and tied me down to this old mattress in the corner. He raped and tortured me the whole night. In the morning he dropped me off at my house.

He had been stalking me for several months, and this happened a few times more after that. I never told anyone because I was too scared, he said he would find me and kill me if I ever told anyone."

"Veterinary student with almost two years of working as an assistant in clinics here.

Most of the time, from my own experience, you hardly see people that dislike their pet. 

However, I've had one situation that I can recall vividly in particular that owners did not seem to have any attachment to their pets.

The first situation was an elderly lady that had left her cat unattended in her house after going on vacation for two weeks. The cat's litter box was full, so the cat ended up defecating on the carpet. She immediately showed up at my place of working wanting to euthanize the cat. This is what we could call a ""convenience"" euthanasia, because the cat ""inconvenienced"" the owner.

The veterinarian I was working with on the case requested, at minimum, bloodwork be performed to at least present an appropriate reason for euthanasia. Bloodwork revealed elevated kidney values. It was a tough to see this seemingly healthy cat be put down for barely elevated values, but from the standpoint as an advocate of an animal, the owner would most likely neglect or abandon the cat. 

Sometimes euthanasia is the appropriate choice to prevent long-term harm to the animal. :("

"When I was 11 I went to Florida on holiday with my family (Disney land etc etc). One day we were at a water park (I forget the name), I was laying in the most shallow part of the wave pool when a huge woman washed over me in a rubber ring. Because of how shallow the water was (about 10-15cm) I was completely trapped and could barely move, I started to panic massively and have no idea how long I was under there. Somehow I managed to wriggle free and she had no idea I was under her, as well as no idea I'd even wriggled free. I had cuts all over my back because the bottom of the pool was rough so people could grip, but it tore me up.

I take it that you haven't been to the ""old"" part then.

My hotel had an Uzbeki restaurant and catered to Uzbeks too. That is one of the thrilling aspects of the old town of Dubai: it is a marketplace and international hub for people from Asia, Africa and Europe. Just sitting at my breakfast table, I see groups of people from Uzbekistan, Oman, Kenya, other Arab countries, and a westerner here and there. This is a global place.

Walking through the old town further underscores that I am at a global hub where people from all over the world come to do small business. There are restaurants for Indian, Kenyan, Iranian and Lebanese food and people from all origins mingle here. 

I walk along the creek and there are little wooden ships, dhows, coming in. They are painted brightly blue. Merchants from Iran or all the way along the Somali coast down to Kenya come to Dubai to unload merchandise. Workers play cards between the bales of unidentified products, which could be food, but also television sets. Dubai has many different meanings, whether you come as a western tourist, as an Uzbeki merchant, a Saudi prince or a Pakistani worker. It is a global multicultural hub, and quite fascinating that way."

And, I kept doing this until I realized that the internet has porn. That's not too bad right? Wait for it, the cringe is coming. I also found my mom and step-mother's toy collections.

So when the time came and I expected the hurt, it didn't. It just felt AMAZING even though the boy I was losing my virginity to was also losing his virginity, and thus inexperienced. He kept cumming, but because it hasn't hurt at all I just wanted more and more. We went through 6 condoms like that.

"Tldr: stopped sex because of a missing butt plug. 


Happened just last Wednesday. 

Had her tied up, bound to the bed, blindfolded but not gagged ...luckily. 

Mid point of a hard stroke she squeaks, ""I think it fell out!""

It being the butt plug she had inserted. So the action is put on pause and I look to see where it went. Not under the left leg. Not under the right leg. Not under her back or her butt. It's a full out mystery. 

Maybe it fell out before when I had her in a different position? So I look on the floor. I look under the bed. Under the dresser. What the fuck??

I have to put the scene on hold now because we're both laughing uncontrollably. It's not a small plug. Not huge, but big enough that I can feel it when I'm in her. 

We both search high and low and can't find it. 

Ah well. Mysteries of life I suppose. 

An hour and a lot of fucking later, ""I have to pee,"" she says. 

So I untie her again and off she goes to the bathroom. After much longer than usual she comes back. She's crying.  Not from pain but from laughing. She's holding up the plug in her hand like George Constanza with that golf ball in that pivotal scene. ""Found it!"" She exclaims. 

I have never once lost a butt plug into someone. They only ever seem to be ejected outward. But somehow...she swallowed it up. 

So silliest reason to stop sex? Easter egg hunt for a missing butt plug that was in the last place we looked but the first place we should have guessed.

My cat jumped on our bed in the middle of the night about 7 years ago meowing as loudly as he could while stepping all over us. We woke up to smoke in our apartment. We couldn't find the source but I called 911. The fire department came and it turned out that the neighbor upstairs had fallen asleep while trying to cook some dinner after he got home from work. The fire fighter said our cat was a hero.

"It was Thursday April 13, 1995. It was roughly 7:00pm &amp; I had just settled down to watch *Three Ninjas Kick Back*. What followed was 93 minutes of unadulterated disappointment (though I will admit, J. Evan Bonifant's portrayal of Tum Tum was rare cinematic treat). As the film came to its close &amp; Miyo soundly beat her bully I recall a feeling contempt for such ham-handed writing. The film was terrible &amp; the younger version of myself couldn't help but feel swindled out of my paper route money. 

Well, if I had to endure through that film &amp; suffer in the knowledge Leonard Wilson, owner of the Clark County Blockbuster, was laughing as he counted every penny of my hard earned paycheck, you could be damn sure I was going to make him suffer. 

So I did what any quick witted twelve year old with a belly full of hate &amp; a mind for revenge would do in that situation; I ejected the VHS without rewinding it &amp; then placed it back in its case. 

Later the next day as my mother drove me back to the Blockbuster to return Three Ninjas *Shit* Back, as I had come to call it, I recall her asking if I had rewound the VHS. I lied &amp; told her that I had. I knew full well that some poor movie rental clerk was going to have to rewind the tape for me. I had read the *""Please be kind &amp; rewind""* sticker a thousand times before. I knew that the Clark County Blockbuster had a $1.00 fee for returning VHS movies that hadn't been rewound. But none of this mattered. For you see gentle reader, Captain Ahab had to have his white whale. And that white whale's name was revenge; revenge for the indignity of having paid to see Three Ninjas Kick Back, for having my hard earned paper route money taken from me by a slick VHS rental monger &amp; his Hollywood cronies. Perhaps most of all it was revenge for the death of innocence... my innocence. 

After that I stopped going to the Clark County Blockbuster. I never paid the $1.00 fee for not rewinding &amp; eventually old man Wilson sent the fee to collections. After a few years of staying one step ahead of the collection agencies Blockbuster went belly up. It was around that time the phone calls stopped &amp; I returned home to be with my family. But the memories of that time live on with in me. "

"In Far Cry 3 you find a pretty boarded up and deserted shack, but can hear a woman crying inside. When you walk in its a huge mess and she's in the very back corner. You talk with her and she mentions how she and her husband were just in a plane crash and he is still stranded on the beach. Naturally, you run down to the beach to go be a hero but when you arrive, the plane is covered in moss, vines, and rust and there's skeletons all around. After walking back to the shack the crying can still be heard , however when you open the door it stops, and when you walk in there's no one there, and as a blast of air passes by you the quest is completed.

"It's usually why they are broke or ""broke"". And you can always spend less money on necessities like food and new clothes to make room for drinking.

My University way of living was borderline alcoholic. I don't like how acceptable it is in those circles. 

I had friends who would literally just eat one meal a day (school lunch, 3 dollars). Dated someone who hadn't bought new underwear or other clothes since moving away from home (he needed it). And then go on to spend crazy amount of money on ""cheap beer"" either at the bar or going to parties. And the bragging about how ""wasted"" you'd been and how you had been drinking for 2 weeks straight and hadn't eaten for two days and how the only thing in their fridge was an onion... How is that something to brag about?!?! ""Wo-ho, look at how self-destructive I am. If I'm lucky my liver will survive another drinking-binge.""

I know people that follow these threads are just like ""oh Trump is an idiot let's look at the world bash him haha"" but what the USA does has real consequences on the rest of the world. Obama and Clinton were both very firm on maintaining the status quo by matching China's power plays in the region, but now nobody has any idea if Trump even has any idea what foreign policy is.

"Friend is dating someone heavily involved with a gang. He lives in her parents house for free, gets her mother to do all of his washing and ironing, and he recently 'borrowed' my friends car to drive to and from work, and to his illegal activities in. 

My first major strike of ""I don't approve of this relationship AT ALL."" Was when she got back from a holiday with him that SHE had paid for, and she had bruises all over her body, she told me that he'd got upset because they went to use a subway in the city they were in, and he lost his temper because the trains stopped running and they had to get a taxi to their hotel instead.

Tried talking her out of the relationship back then, and even sent her abuse helpline numbers. I also sobbed to her that she needed to end it as he'd kill her, due to all of the stories I've heard about his violence previously. 

Sadly, I can't control her and her life decisions, so she continued to date him. 

My final straw with her was when she called a mutual friend screaming at him to pick her up immediately without telling anyone what was going on. 
She got picked up and our mutual friend had to drive two hours away from where he'd picked her up, so she could hide away. 

Her boyfriend's gang had been having some beef with another gang, and due to him using her car, the rival gang surrounded her vehicle and began trying to tip it over as she was inside, she managed to escape unharmed, but very shaken up. 

Told her I will not continue our friendship if she continues to date him, putting herself in danger, she told me our friendship was finished. "

"[It looks like smacking someone's back could save them.](http://inhomecpr.com/choking-emergency-the-heimlich-maneuver-or-back-blows/) Of interest from the article:

and

&gt;In 2006, the American Red Cross reintroduced back blows as the initial response to choking.  The approach is called, “five and five.”  If five back blows are unsuccessful in clearing the airway, then five abdominal thrusts are used


Edit: Adding a comment from /u/jstrydor, a former medic, who makes a good point:
&gt;...most people don't understand what actual choking is. Severe coughing with a blue face isn't choking. Choking is silent, no air movement at all. I think the fear was that people doing back blows to the non-choking person could accidentally cause them to actually choke by making them gasp from the back blows."

"When i was in 6th ot 7th grade there was a teacher's assistant or a substitute...i don't remember which. We were all lined up at the door to be let out for lunch and it was snowing outside. At the time i lived in England so it wasn't the kind of snow that stuck but still cold af.

So we all line up with our coats and junk on and i put on my hat as the lady is going past. And she stops, looks at me, and holds out her hand. I stare confused. This chick wants my hat! Because i put it on indoors. I'm not sure if other school had this rule but i was a military brat and went to school on base so our rule is no hats inside, but generally speaking if you're about to go outside and it's crazy cold outside no one questions it obviously because logic... and its hard to put a hat on once you get your gloves on.

Not only did she confiscate my freaking winter 
hat,but she tells me I'll have to have a parent come in to pick it up for me. I'm a good a kid with no history of problems, all the teachers like me and what not. I tell my mom what exactly what happened after school and she's confused like 'are you sure it wasnt something else or you're forgetting a detail or something?' And she goes to the lady after her meeting that day and come back pissed as hell.

The sub/teacher's assistant told her the SAME EXACT story. So not only am i pissed but she's just as pissed as i am at the lady because not only was she angry that she'd made her kid walk in cold weather without a hat she specifically bought in anticipation of snow but my mom is also a teacher with importabnt papers to grade and lesson plans that she was behind on at the time and the lady wasted a freaking half hour to an hour of her day for a bullshit show of power."

On one hand person to person they are amazing people who share a love for a certain style of music, they can talk up this band or that band all day, and are some of the friendliest people you can go to a concert with.  There is a brotherhood amongst Metal fans, and partially why I love the genere and community, but there are some major gripes I have with the community as welll.  

....on the other hand they are some of the most anal, finicky, and close minded people when it comes to other styles of music. (especially the disdain they show for groups for changing styles) Genere-defining runs way out of hand with many of us..  If a certain band doesn't meet some specific criteria for their definition of metal, according to them ""it ain't metal""  The elitism within the metal community is deplorable.  Band/sub-genre specific fanboyism is annoyingly frustrating (looking at you Tool fans).  Metal is a wide and varying genre of music.. if you don't like this or that band/sub-genre... it's all good.

I honestly can't remember a lot of the details of what led up to this incident.  What I do remember is getting a phone call from him, out of the blue, in which he told me he might be going back to jail.  He told me that he needed me to call his friend pretending to be his parole officer and ask her some questions.  Apparently, this was supposed to have been done by his actual parole officer in order for him to stay out of jail, but he couldn't get a hold of his parole officer, and the deadline for this conversation was that day.  He assured me that his friend had never spoken with this officer herself, so she wouldn't know that the wrong voice was talking to her.

And eyelashes can definitely be darker than other hair, so it's not that weird for him to have assumed that what he saw on you all the time was probably natural.

"As a straight man, I missed the holy grail of sex acts. 

It was a couple years ago, friend of a friends party. I show up, and this party is DEAD. Everyone is sitting in chairs in a circle, no music, casual drinking, and very little talking. I make my way over to the one stoner kid who looks like he's ready to toke, and we hit it off. I point at a couple people, ask if they smoke and tell them to come on over. We get some music started up, and finally the party starts to lighten up.

Fast forward a couple hours, and I am hammered. I decided I wanted the couch, there was a couple bedrooms, another chair someone was in, and a girl on the floor. 

Well while I was fast asleep, the friend I came with is making her way to the bathroom when she sees me on the couch passed out. Then she sees some movement on the floor. Turns out, one girl had climbed under the blankets with the other girl who was sleeping on the floor. I had missed some sweet lesbian action. They were both really hot, too, and all night I was really hitting it off with one of them.

"Bullying serves no social function. It's the mosquito of the social world. There are numerous levels of social correction that do not involve the levels of degradation that bullying does.

I'm sorry if this sounds harsh but you seem to have done very little research on what causes bullying, what the social impacts are, and how individuals respond to it in both the near and long term.

"I always wrestled with this.  I grew up Christian and my grandparents weren't and I remembered when they died being crushed that they were going to Hell.  That's when I started to question everything.  It didn't make sense that my wonderful grandparents were going to hell for not believing in God, they were good people! Were they really going to spend an eternity in hell because they weren't Christian for their 70-80 years of life?  That seems crazy to me now.  People getting punished for eternity for not being a christian during their relatively short life span?  Also I'm gay but lead what I think is a good, moral life.  Am I really going to Hell because of one aspect of my life I can't control?"

"I drive for Lyft and this happened the weekend of St Patrick's day. I was out doing my rounds, and that night was pretty crazy due to St Patrick's day, the moon was full, and during SXSW. I had a full car of people. This was a Lyft line so it was a pair of two people. A couple composed of a guy and girl, and two girlfriends out and about for the night.

We stopped at a red light and waited for it to turn green, when suddenly a line of women were walking in front my car, across the crosswalk. Well the leader of the line decided to take off her top, bra and all. The remain 5 women followed along and removed their tops as well! Me and the girlfriend, from the couple, just watched in awe as 6 women walk across without tops. It was a good night.

I just wish I had my dash cam then. Now I drive with one 24/7."

"We worked together for a good while before ever really hanging out because we work on different teams, but at some point, we stared going to bars together more often with other coworkers and we just got along. One night, just her and I went out to a bar and she had had a few drinks, and so had I, and we started kissing. We went back to her place, and before going any further, I told her I wasn't looking for a relationship and that anything we did would be just as friends with benefits. She agreed.

It's months later now and we've had some back and forths as to what our relationship is (friends? Couple?) and basically, we're more than friends with benefits but not quite in a relationship either. Anyway, I'm moving away in a few months and that'll be the end to our sexual relationship."

It went from something *I* enjoyed to something we enjoyed doing together.

"We had a friend of a friend in a little neighborhood who gave us a place to stay. Found a cheap ticket for 7 days round trip. Got rid of everything and stored my car at my parents. Found a job at a call center and stayed for a year. Decided that I should stay past the 7 days and have to figure out a way back home. Whether it was shitty or fun I knew it would be an awesome life lesson. Only had the place to stay planned. Winged it from there. Actually, I met a DJ on MySpace (this was 2006 lol ) and he helped me network and find a way to meet people when I split up from my group. 

Immigration laws have made job harder to find in a way, I imagine. Came home, finished my degree, did a corporate job for two years then moved back for two years in 2010ish. Started at a call center again and ended up managing a hotel in  Puerto Viejo on the Caribbean coast. "

"In Vancouver there's a pretty widespread stereotype of Chinese immigrants/expats being super rich, buying up expensive property as investment and then leaving it empty, driving expensive cars like assholes, and generally failing to integrate into the community at large. That does happen a lot, and I get that it's frustrating and a serious problem, but a lot of people in the city (and especially on the subreddit) take it as licence to be racist towards the Chinese population in general.


I was born here, but my family are Chinese who came over in the 1960s with a much more blue-collar wave of immigrants. We've worked hard for what we have and have strived to become part of the community, so it pisses me off that we also get a lot of the hate that is directed against the new Chinese."

"We were camping in Sequoia National Forest and our campground was about as secluded as it gets, just to reach it you had to go on a treacherous one way dirt road (if you could call it that) for over an hour. We arrived in the afternoon to find the campground only had two other inhabitants, the campground host and an older lady with a little dog. We set everything up, cooked some dinner and settled in to get some rest as the sun went down. Throughout the night we would be awakened here and there by sounds, nothing out of the ordinary for camping in the middle of the dense woods, just things like branches snapping and things moving in the trees. 

Around 11 PM we heard something going through the bolted trash cans around the campground (there were no bear bins here), knowing we were in bear country I beeped my car a few times to try and scare off whatever curious creature was digging in there. This happened a few times, whatever it was kept coming back. As the night went on things got more and more strange. A meadow about 100 yards from where our tent was that was populated by a few wild cattle earlier that day was some kind of scene for something terrible going down. We heard the sounds of cows screaming bloody murder, like they were being torn apart. My initial thought was ""shit, it's a bear/cougar/pack of coyotes"", some kind of predator was fucking these cows up, it was obvious they were in great distress. But after that there was a noise I heard that I've never heard any animal make. It was a loud, deep, howling sound. Almost like a portamento where it starts off low and rises higher and higher in pitch. It was loud as fuck, I could feel it in my chest vibrating. Needless to say we were all pretty freaked. 

It didn't stop there, along with the sounds of dying cows we also heard things like massive branches being torn off the trees around us, something knocking against the trees (like with a rock or a stick), and at one point something big was walking around our camp, when we stuck a flash light to the window in the tent something massive went running by our tent, shaking the ground as it ran, and it was fast as all hell. Eventually all this commotion died down, but not before that howl/shriek let out again, this time further away into the woods. Of course I didn't sleep at all that night, I anxiously waited for the sun to rise before I inspected the campground. 

Even though we had heard trash being ripped and bottles clanking together, the trash cans were not knocked over, and they were still chained shut, which we thought was odd, because a bear surely would've made more of a mess. We searched for bear or cougar tracks, and the only thing we found was I shit you not but human looking tracks. Like bare human feet, maybe a little bigger than normal size (not like those huge bigfoot tracks people have casts of). I will say I am far from a conspiracy theorist, I'm a huge skeptic, the thought of bigfoot I have always laughed off and made fun of, but this was freaking me out. The older lady who was in the campground next to us? She booked it out of there early in the morning, leaving in a hurry. As the day went on and the prospect of spending another night there, now being the only campers present, became less and less appealing. We packed up quick before the sun got too low and got the fuck outta dodge. On the way home while discussing what had happened, my girlfriend pulled up various ""sasquatch sounds"" recorded on youtube, some were ridiculous but one (I believe recorded in Ohio?) sounded identical to what we heard. Let's just say I'm a little less skeptical now than I used to be.

TL;DR: Went camping deep in Sequoia National Forest, possibly came close to a sasquatch, got the fuck out.

"Being a pyrotechnician. I mean I wouldn't say it ""sucks"" compared to many jobs, but the task of setting up fireworks displays requires being outside in the full sun in what is usually 100°F/37°C weather.

We're busy all year, so translate the same thing to the freezing cold and/or rain. 

The week of July 4th usually involves months of planning ahead of time, loading/unloading hot/humid shipping containers, several consecutive days of setup/fire show/teardown (14 hour days at least), followed by unloading all the trucks after all is said and done.

"Went on a blind date. To meet a blind girl. I turned up and she was already sat at the table. I was in the restaurant 6ft away and decided I didn't like the look of her and knew she wasn't my type. So I just left quietly. She sat there, oblivious. I knew she was pretty stoked to go on a date as she'd struggled with her worsening eyesight over a few years, as a mutual friend told me. It was her first date in a couple of years and insisted that she go alone to meet me to get some confidence up.

Yes I'm going to hell. I was young and a fucking idiot, especially as she was hot (in retrospect) and I was batting way out of my league. I had no problem with her blindness, it wasn't that. I think, 20 years later, that I left because I didn't like her shoes or something ridiculous.

"My brother and I would play this on our acoustic guitars in the garage. Smoking weed, sitting on a garage sofa. 19, no direction in life but vauge optimism about the future.

I think about that time often.

Ive got a house, a career, a wife, a baby on the way. He's got batman toys and definite drinking problem.

He taught me the basics of guitar. He was really good at it. He had tons of foot peddles, a giant amp, and 3 guitars. Me, I just tinkered around, learning Fast Car, Jack Johnson stuff, and some dumb, nameless westerner song that I made up. He was so cool and I was such a loser.

So yeah, anyways. We'd get stoned and jam out. The way the acoustic guitars sounded together was increadible. Ha, we probably were fucking terrible though.

"Short version: Had sex with my brother-in-law.

Longer version: My husband's brother is 4 years younger than him and didn't have much of a social life of his own when we first met. He started hanging out with us a lot, which when my husband got a job that meant he was gone for days on end meant hanging out with ME a lot. Over time shared a lot of info about himself including that as a 35-year-old man he'd never had sex before. He said he felt like he'd ""missed the window"" when everyone has their first time in their teens or 20s and it was too weird now and he figured he would just be a life long virgin. 

One night we were drinking together and out of nowhere he blurted ""I want to fuck you."" I was probably about a 5 on a drunkenness scale from 1 = totally sober to 10 = call the ER, and privately I'd always thought he was pretty good looking, so... I said ok. 

It was not great sex. I believe him when he says it was his first time because... yeah, it was definitely his first time. Ugh, I feel guilty even writing this out. 

The incident was never repeated and since then we moved to a different state (not because of that, though). I WILL say that after it happened, he started dating people, which he had never done prior to that, so I think it did kind of break a logjam for him, so to speak. I know it probably doesn't sound like it from this story, but he's a good guy. 

Anyway that's my story.

Edit to answer some questions: My husband does know (I know this story violates the OP as a result, oh well.) I told him because I hated keeping a secret from him and it's honestly not like I made a super rational or logical decision to do this thing in the first place. He wanted to know if it had been an ongoing thing and I was like HELL NO. He was surprised and thoughtful but not really angry, which as I'm sure you can imagine was a huge relief to me (as was getting it off my chest). His main reaction was ""well, I hope it helped him in some way."" To my knowledge they have never spoken about it. 

As for how our marriage is, it is and always has been great, which I think is a lot of the reason that a) I felt I had to tell him and b) he took it as well as he did. When you have a 10-year foundation of love and support to build on, it helps in getting through something like this. (And ftr that was 10 years ago; we just passed our 20-year anniversary.) I figure I used up my reserves of goodwill on that incident, though. Not going to be a repeat."

"I've worked with some terrible people. However, terrible people usually do terrible things against company policy and get fired. Then there are the annoying people who don't fuck up that badly and just linger to annoy more. These are some of their stories.

B: B is an 18-year-old on his first job. I was his manager, but I didn't actually have a hand in hiring him. B's job involved catching fish for customers and putting them in a bag, then closing the bag with a rubber band. B could not work rubber bands. It was like the ""What are potatoes?"" guy from reddit history, but he really must never have encountered a single rubber band in his life. And no matter how many times I and others showed him how to use rubber bands, he just couldn't do it.

A: It has come to my attention that A may have had an autism spectrum disorder, but as that person had no qualifications to diagnose anyone besides, ""I read it on the internet,"" (AKA, the Jenny McCarthy degree), I'm not sure. A creeped customers and coworkers alike. We were all instructed to use the word ""assistance"" rather than ""help"" because our surveys asked if we offered assistance and our surveys turned out better if we used the words the survey used.

This resulted in A approaching customers, shoulders hunched up to his ears because of...something?... and saying, ""can i offer you **ASSISTANCE?**"" No one wanted assistance from him.

A once overheard a female associate complaining of pain. She was not talking to him. But he jumped right in and said, ""Is it cramps? My mom and I are close, so I know about periods."" Why, god, why?

A once pissed off an entire department by making small talk. What was this small talk? ""You guys should clean better,"" followed by a nervous chuckle. And he would stop by their department every chance he could to make more small talk. It got so bad that I gave that department permission to tell A he needed to face something.

D: We live in the south. Wrasslin' is pretty popular here. D adored wrestlers. It was nearly all she would talk about. And she would talk about how she didn't have a boyfriend currently because she was waiting for someone who looked like and had the body of John Cena. You know, John Cena of r/potatosalad fame. I once told her about the r/johncena reddit joke, and she got offended.

When a customer came to check out, before even saying hello, D would say, ""That'll be one million dollars."" Every. Single. Fucking. Time. We had several regulars complain. We had people who worked there avoid making their own purchases if D was on the register.

It quickly became known that you could not let D know where you lived. A couple people had invited her over for a party or some such, and then she took it upon herself to drop by whenever she felt like it. An intimate night in with your wife? LOL HERE'S D. She once dropped by a manager's house (company has a strict fraternization policy between managers and associates) to watch the wrasslin', and because that guy's cousin apparently had the body of John Cena, she spent the whole time making him increasingly uncomfortable by repeatedly hitting on him.

C: C is actually my boss, so I'm his employee. C was hired outside the company. He had a retail manager experience, so all he really needed to do was learn our policies and procedures and our software, etc. There were learning modules for him to do, but he also was supposed to learn from his immediate subordinate and from other store managers in the company. He did not listen to a goddamn thing.

He is a salaried manager, so he does not have to clock in and out. His contract stipulates that he works 40 hours a week. Whatever he's getting paid, he's getting paid with the assumption he's at the store full time. He is not. C loves golf. If it's good golfing weather, he leaves early or just doesn't come in at all.

When he is in, he stays in the office and watches golfing videos.

He also micromanages whenever he can. Our scheduling program automatically schedules people, but also allows us to hand schedule. When I do it, I type in the time of the shift and press enter to go to the next day of the week for that associate. It gets me to where I need to be. C presses tab, not enter. It does the same thing. I am doing it wrong.

C also gets very offended if someone asks an associate to do something when he has already asked that associate to do something -- even if the second person doesn't know about the first. C has to win, because he's the guy in charge. So when he gave someone a task, and another person asked that associate to perform a different task that was extremely important and had to be finished first for the safety of the animals in our store, C countermanded that and told the associate that whatever he says goes. Which is understandable, but since C didn't listen about our policies, he risked injuring our pets by not knowing why the pets needed to be taken care of first.

After the district manager received several complaints from multiple associates about C's behavior, she came for a visit. After the visit, C wanted to explain to me why he did what he did that got complained about (he rightly guessed I had snitched on his lazy ass). I let him know that playing golf when he needed to be in the store had really pissed me off. And he told me that as store manager, he wasn't going to be in the store if everything is running smoothly, which his boss said wasn't happening. He also said that as store manager, he shouldn't have to deal with customers. Ever. He should leave before we get a lot of customers during the day. This is also known as not coming to work or leaving early to play golf.

C also is obsessed with group texts. Former manager had 1 group text for all managers. Since February, C has created at least 8 group texts for managers for various reasons. I say at least, because I've been off work since May dealing with leukemia, and I know he's created at least 3 more group texts that don't involve me. In fact, I found this out by creating a group text that dropped an associate from the manager group text (she should not have been included in the first place). And then C immediately started a different group text to say that it was basically my fault for needing a new group text because I wasn't using the right group text that he started that no longer included that associate (and hadn't included me, because I had no idea). And then went on to say he would start an additional group text the next day, even though he apparently had 2 groups that had everyone it needed (besides me) and no one it didn't (that associate). It was so bad while I was still involved that I muted that group so I wouldn't have to hear it beep.

Finally, we have C violating federal law. If you clock in or out immediately after someone else, the time clock may not recognize it because you didn't wait 5 seconds for it to go back to the right screen. I believe this happened to me one day. I had no idea I had not clocked out for a shift. My time for the week was missing 6 hours that I had worked. Easy enough to fix. But C told another manager that if I expected to get paid, I had to clock in and out.

Oh hell no, motherfucker. I get paid whether or not I clock in and out. I may get fired for not following policy when clocking in out, if I do it often enough to cause problems, but I get paid for whatever time I work. I know it's a pain to call someone and ask them what time they left when you're doing payroll, but it has to be done. And even if he was going to wait for me to notice it, he has absolutely no business telling someone else that if I expect to get paid, I have to clock in and out. That's not something to discuss with anyone else. "

"I once one the big display prize--a giant pikachu stuffed toy--at one of those fishing games. it cost two dollars a try. I only had two dollars and I really wanted that pikachu, but my dad told me not to waste my money. Well, no one had ever told me the games were rigged, I'd never been to a carnival before. So I tried it, and I remember the look on the game runner's face, he was just shocked.   it was a game where each 'fish' had a dot on the bottom, in a color. green dot--little prize, blue dot--medium prize, and so one, so it wasn't like you could even trade prizes up to get the big one. someone must have messed up or wanted me to win as a "" look see not rigged"" thing because I got the ""grand prize"" dot. I was maybe 8 or 9, tiny little thing, and I just looked at him "" the Pikachu's the grand prize right?""

""uh...yeah..."" he seemed pretty upset. tried to talk me into a different prize, i forget what it was, but I insisted on that pikachu. 16 years later, I still have him. 

I figure I used up all my luck that day and haven't played a carnival game since."

"I would pick a more obscure language than Latin.  That's a dead language, but only in the sense that no one speaks it as their primary.

I'd go with an extremely rare word that *wasn't* a hepax legomenon if the language I went with wasn't reconstructed, too, just because those extraordinarily rare terms have serious academic interest and I might accidentally watch a video where someone uses one.

If it's a life or death thing, I want a word that I know that no one else will *ever* use in proximity to me.  The more obscure the better. *But* I want to be able to use it if circumstances ever become so extreme that I *need* to die so no weird-ass words like the chemical name of Oxytocin."

"not a festival worker, but festival goer!

"I was an auto parts store manager. 

In that retail setting, you don't see too many female employees, and when some customers come in (female customers usually being the bigger offender) they want to talk to a male employee. 

In this case, I was working with another employee, a female manager, when a guy came in and started asking her questions. He clearly knew little, as he was the one asking questions. Our female manager was answering them, but the guy didn't like or believe the answers coming from her. I was in the back around the corner, but listening to the conversation. 

The guy said she clearly couldn't help him and he needed to talk to a man. I came out from around the corner about this time and the customer came down to the register where I was standing. He started asking me questions about parts, and I told him ""Hmmm, that is a good question. Let me ask our expert..."" and I called over our female manager. 

Customer got all huffy and said we were running a two bit store and that we didn't know anything. He told us he'd visit out competitor and then left. That coming from the guy asking the questions, not giving the answers. I really don't like those kind of people. "

"I love my job, my wife, and my son. I own my own company, I have a great house, I have a lot of things going for me.

However, financial stability has been elusive these last 8 years since I started my company and my dream job, and despite my love of the work there has been a constant trend of me pushing things to redline out of fear of losing what I have. Consequently I rarely enjoy what I have, and anxiety is perpetually off the charts.

It's more complex than that, but I keep remembering when I could just go to work, get paid, and come home with some degree of fondness.

For the past few years I tried to build a company that was slightly larger (half a dozen or so people) while maintaining stability, so that I could take breaks, etc. 

Ironically the added financial pressure of more people in the boat, and me really being reluctant to let anyone go, has caused no end of trouble for me. At this point I basically am in a mode where I'm trying to make sure I can get my current project done completely on my own, and hopefully get someone else to foot the bill prior to launch instead of me for once.

I was never wanting to empire-build, but I just wanted to basically make a small and close knit team of folks who could work together for 30 years and do awesome things in that time. I almost had it. But market changes and my own misjudgements mostly sank that dream, and I've been pretty much falling down the stairs continually the last two years.

Right now I just want stability and the ability to do the work I love on my own, and not to hurt anybody while doing so. I want a healthier work life balance. If you can manage that balance, in some ways that's worth more than a dream job. 

If you can have it all, then great, obviously do that. Just try not to trade life for a dream job, because ""just for a while"" can become ""indefinitely"" frighteningly fast."

First thing I did when I got home was viciously masturbate to the smell and ejaculate on the shirt. Thing is, the smell didn't go away for like a fortnight, and I'd continue to jerk it to the same shirt over and over for at least 14 days consecutively. Eventually the smell faded and I was just left with a crusty shirt, which I had to throw away"

"A guy I thought was a friend tried to commit suicide in front of me.  He had the whole day planned out.  He asked me to drive him up to the mountains.  He had me stop and get a disposable camera.  He had me stop at one waterfall and then another, the second one had an 80ft fall.  He asked me to take his dog down below and take a picture of him.  Immediately after the photo he went down.  The waterfall was fairly dry but there was a small pool at the bottom, about the size of a coffin, like the ones that flare out at the elbows.  There was also a ledge maybe 20ft down.  
  
I ran up to him thinking he was already dead.  I called 911 but it was a dead zone, I had 0 bars.  It went though anyway.  All the operator got from me was, ""friend...off cliff,"" then my phone died.  Those 911 operators did some heroic level detective work to find out who I was and where I was calling from.  The tower that received my call was apparently in a neighboring state.  It took several hours before they found us.  The sun was almost completely gone when I saw the silhouette of a head poke over the top of the cliff.  
  
He was airlifted to a hospital a pretty long way away.  The guy was in the hospital for more than a month.  He had broken all of his ribs, punctured both lungs, torn his liver, broke his pelvis, had part of his wrist jutting through his skin, and cracked his skull.  He lived though.

You are a man, correct? In that case, you probably have a penis. Most men have penises. Most sane people are aware of this.

Also, even if you *did* have a boner in public, so what? It's something your body just *does*, often without your consent."

"Im not sure if this counts, but one time at work my friend was going into the bathroom/locker room(single room with one lacking door)and i made it inside before he did, without him knowing, and I hid behind the door. 

The door opens inward, so the door keeps you from being seen, and if you were in the spot behind it, when closed, a person facing the toilet would have their back to you. I was intending to scare him right as he walked in, but something went wrong.

He walked in way faster than I was expecting and he slammed the door behind himself as he whipped out his dick to pee in the toilet in one motion, and no matter what it was going to be frickin wierd, so I just kinda went, ""AHHHhhhhh"" 

He kinda got scared, and it wasn't too awkward, but of course there was someone waiting to use the bathroom outside the door and saw us both coming out. I guess I regret that a bit."

Then he just randomly hugged her and whispered something in her ear and I saw her smile and read her lips say ""I love you too"". I melted.

"The head of my HOA has been watching me whenever I take my dog out. He literally waits by the window in the evenings to see if I take my dog onto the grass by the back of my apartment.

This is communal grass, but I have checked the rules many times and NOWHERE does it state dogs aren't allowed on it. I've even seen him let his dog out on that grass and the dog will often do it's business there when he's not watching.

He's left an anonymous, handwritten note taped to my door saying that he's seen me going out there and to stop. I know it's him because he has very distinct writing. The next closest place is the park next door, which is closed after sundown, and park rangers have said not to use it in the dark. Turns out this HOA guy has basically forced all of the other dog owners to use that park anyways. "
"Put a lot of effort in at the beginning. Everyone is desperately looking for friends so people will be more open.

Stop by other people's room and join in whatever they're doing. You don't have to stay best friends with your dorm friends. It's okay if they're just people to hang out with temporarily until you make other friends. But it sets the tone and allows you to meet more people through them"

"See a counselor. Normally abusive relationships form from patterns learned in youth and from unmet expectations in current relationships. You need a good counselor that can help you get sorted.

However, when we finally go divorced, I changed radically back to who I was before we got married. I'm on my second marriage now, and I've not even raised my voice. Sometimes the person we're with just pushes our buttons. 

This is why you should get counseling, though. Since you love her you should try to work through these issues, figure out what it was that made you so angry. It'll make your marriage better.

Anyway, sorry for rambling. This was just the most relatable thing I've read in a long while."

"My story doesn't exactly fit the bill, but close. I haven't told the whole story to anyone before now. So strap in folks, ride's about to start.

She was born while I was in Basic Training, (for that I was allowed to call the wife for 15 minutes.) I first saw her at my Basic Graduation when she was already 6 weeks old. It was amazing, I spent as much of those two days as I could with them before being shipped off to Tech School. Once I got there the wife and I would talk all the time and on weekends I would go to the Base Library (free WiFi) and we would Skype so I could see them. 

Then one day I didn't hear from her. She didn't respond to my calls or texts or anything. Same thing the next day, and the next. This went on for a full week and let me tell you Reddit, I was freaking out. It was so abrupt and out of the ordinary, I was calling everybody I knew back home to find out what the hell was going on. Finally at the end of that week she calls me back, I'm going nuts worried. Turns out she was on a bit of a bender (Can't remember what, but whatever ""high"" was popular back in 2009.) So I'm trying to figure out why and what's going on and she's being really evasive, but I finally coax an explanation out of her. 

Turns out around the time she got pregnant she cheated with one of her ex-boyfriends and wasn't sure who the father was because our daughter kinda looked like him. To this day, that was easily the loudest I have ever shouted at someone. I'm pretty sure i woke a few people in the dorm and maybe a couple at the local cemetery, my whole world just imploded. We sort of patched things to the point of ""this is not over and will not be for a long time."" 

There was a lot of talking about it and at some point I told myself ""I don't care, this is my child and I will raise her."" Somehow I managed to make it through the remaining months of school and back home to pack up the house to move onto my first duty station.  Things didn't improve much before other dude started stirring up shit and my wife didn't really do much to stop it. It snapped for me when he called her ""his"" daughter and started talking shit to my family. 

Early 2011 I decided I wanted a paternity test but the wife was against it, she didn't want to know the truth. I bought one anyways and while it had sample collectors for mom, dad, and child, I found out I only really needed mine and my daughters. So I collected the samples for the two of us and sent it off. Meanwhile, things were degrading quickly between my wife and I to the point where we finally talked about separation. During one argument she even told me if the results came back that our daughter was not mine, she would leave and I would never see them again. 

The day came and the results were in. One of the scariest moments in your life is right before you learn the truth you're scared of. So I bucked up, opened the letter and tried to parse all of the information on the pages. I read it over and over, to make sure I understood what the results were. 99.bla bla % chance that ZombieNinjaDezz is the father of Wee Daughter. Up to that point i kept telling myself that either way I was still her dad, but I was both relieved and overjoyed.  

The First thing I did was log into their website and download the pdf version of the report. Then I got on the Book-o-Face and sent it to Other Dude with the message ""Suck it Trebek! Now leave my kid alone!"" At first he didn't believe me and thought I had shopped it or something, then he called my wife and asked her about it. She didn't even know I had received the results yet and came in asking about it, she was also upset at the way I'd told him. I didn't care though, he's a dick and last I heard he still makes his money selling drugs out of the McDonalds Drive-thru.

Fast forward a little bit and the Separation is happening. The wife, (who up to that point now hadn't had a job since she got pregnant,) had started working as a waitress at a local strip club. It didn't bother me, but seeing as her hours meant she was gone all night and asleep all day she wouldn't be able to spend much time with our daughter, so I thought it made more sense for her to stay with me. There was a lot of push back but eventually logic got the better of her and she agreed, I was the more stable, (financially and other) and had the better schedule.  

I told her from day one that I pretty much had an open door policy. If she wanted to come hang out she was welcome, or if she wanted to take our daughter out to do something that was fine too. Either way all she had to do was give me a heads up. There were a few plans made but every time, on the day of said plan, mother was unreachable and nowhere to be found and every time there would be some excuse for what happened. Eventually I stopped trying to set things up and just let it go. 

To give you an idea how often she saw her mom, at one point when she was about 3 we were sitting in my chair on the computer and I pulled up different family members on Facebook and asked her who they were. She was able to name her grandparents, a couple aunts and a few people. When I pulled up a picture of her mom and asked who she was, my daughter had no idea. A few months later, her mom just kinda reappeared out of nowhere. I was hesitant at first, but I didn't want to be that person who keeps a kid from their parent.

Things were going well, they spent a lot of time together and mom and I were even patching up. Then it comes time that I'm leaving the military and moving to be with family. Mom has the option to move to the same area but doesn't want to ""yet.""  So Wee Bug and I move, still regularly talk to mom and everything. After a while It's clear that mom has no intentions of moving to be close to us and everything we had rebuilt to this point is for naught. I finally opened my eyes, realized things were never going to be good again and decided to lawyer up. 

As we hear so often, most places favor the mother when it comes to custody of children, so I was gearing up for a fight. I was very lucky to have a decent lawyer and an awesome judge who is known to be very hard on the absent parent. Mom liked to raise a big stink and be difficult, but when it came time for the courtroom, she folded like a piece of paper and I was given sole custody and rights. Because mom had a track record of being absent and inconsistent with contact, she was ordered along with child support to call by phone at least once a week, and some sort of video call at least twice a month. We agreed on a rough time schedule that would work for both of us and all was well. 

At least all was well for a couple months before mom fell back into the same shit as before. She would be good for a while then just drop off the face of the earth. This has really played hell with my daughter emotionally to the point where early this year I told her mom that the game is over, she is not allowed to contact her anymore because of what she's doing to her.  Oh, and lets not forget, It was a year before we saw any of that child support and that's only because I took it to the CSED.

It's been 6 years now I've been raising Wee Bug on my own and about 6 months since we've heard from the mom. It has never been easy, and I question every decision every day, but in the end, I think it's for the better."

Being an assassin worth his salt, my guy then, naturally, murdered the dwarf to prevent him from speaking out about our presence. It had to be done! 

In hindsight, it wasn't a smart move, because immediately afterwards we realized we still had questions, but our witness was dead. Whoops. "

The only time when you could expect to have your 'privacy' invaded is if you do something stupid that causes work for them. Examples include:

Helpdesk will judge you based on the selection and the quality the rips of the movies and may add good ones to their own drives, before making room on yours.

""How did they get all this malware?"" A quick view of the browsing history will result in new items to add to the webfilter as well as a selection of animal noises to make under your breath as you pass them by on the floor.

Generally whenever you break something and annoy people and create work for them you raise their curiosity of how it got broken.

Also for routine maintenance if you have some files that you don't want anyone else to see don't put them on your desktop when you ask IT to come over and take a look. The same goes for your desktop background.

Most IT are pretty much live and let live, but some let their supposed power go to their heads.

That was when i saw him for what he was he was red in the face pissed about it, my sister shoved him out of our apartment crying saying to leave me alone and just go, apareantly before he confronted me about this big issue he was telling my sister he was going to beat my ass for like an hour in their room which is why he was raising his voice which had me concerned. After he left that day i told my sister to never let him back in because he's the kind of guy who will hit her as soon as he thinks he can get away with it. She didnt beleive me and let him move back in a month later. I left and moved back in with my mom, ill admit i was scared of him a bit, he is like twice my size and all muscle, and i didnt want to be their if something happened to my sister because i was afraid i would either not be able to stop him or would just straight up kill him. But anyway 2 days after i moved out my mom rushes downstairs and tells me to get in the car he just beat her up and she called bawling her eyes out. I was more pissed than he was about the cigarette ive never been so angry in my life, my face was bright red and i was breathing very heavily i just knew that if i would have caught him then i would have killed him or brought him within and inch of his life idgaf how big he was. We got their and his coward ass was long gone, good thing the police caught up to him pretty quick because i was out looking for him myself. once it was all said and done and she was their in front of me crying saying how stupid she was and how she should have listened to everyone. i never felt so guilty in my life, i felt like i should have pushed harder and made her see what he really was because i never wanted her to learn the hard way like that."

Got the weather warnings by fluke and managed to get out via overnight transport to Thailand, where I continued to travel to somewhere interesting and far away (small island in the South), without appreciating the knock-on effect of such a massive storm across the entire region. Storms worsened, transport on/off the island were cancelled completely, so I was stuck there for 3 days, where there was no hospital or medical facility. I was watching the storms out at sea on the beach (immense lightening, huge waves, crazy wind that was destroying beach palms all over the place), when this little feral cat arrives out of nowhere and starts harassing my feet which were buried in the sand. It uprooted a small Scorpion which was buried exactly where my feet were, and proceeded to claw at it whilst I slowly realised that had I been stung, it could have been very bad indeed, what with no way of getting to treatment."

"Almost ten years ago now, I lost my best friend to a terrible car crash. Among so many other things, and being bipolar, it almost ruined me. Then, five years ago, I met a guy. And five years of struggling with mental illness I realized something. Here was this amazing guy who just wanted to be near me, that I fit so well with, why was I avoiding him? Why didn't I spend more time with him? Why didn't I go on a date with him? He fit me so well. So one day I decided to stop letting all of the negativity affect me, and that I was going to be happy. Every time I struggle, every morning where I just want to shut off my alarm and sleep, I remind myself that I want to be happy. If I sleep all day, I won't actually be happy. If I go to work and make a paycheck, I'll be happy. So I make the choice to be happy.

In October, me and the guy are getting married. We choose to be happy."

"My boyfriend and I talked early on about seeing other people while being together. I am pretty monogamous, so I was very against that. It was strange to me as well since I hadn't been saying no to him when he wanted to have sex. It was like he just wanted to have sex with whoever, and still have the romantic side with me. I don't think there's anything wrong with someone for wanting it, but I told him it made me feel really uncomfortable. He said ok, we reached an agreement.

Fast forward a few months later, and he brings it up again as if we never spoke about it before. He had downloaded an app and was apparently already looking on the side. I was upset, and that's when I realized that neither of us were really wrong in our feelings. We just wanted different things. I know I could probably have been more open-minded, but I also don't believe polyamorous relationships work unless both people go in *knowing* that that is what they want.

But also what hurt me is he was just going ahead with it, regardless of my feelings. He just decided it wouldn't hurt my feelings and looked to score. I asked for a break, and we were going to wait a week and just not see each other and live our lives as ""single"" and see how it went. Almost out of spite I downloaded the same app, and there he was. Looking right away. I ended it officially not long after.

The worst part? I was blind to how single-minded he was about sex. There were red flags that I pushed aside because I wanted it to work. He had accepted money for sex before... that was a big one. A mutual friend of ours told me he had some mean nicknames for me behind my back. I felt like I was just a toy for him to get off on occasionally.

It's also shaped how I date now. I don't trust people who immediately get sexual. Like it's literally a dealbreaker for me if someone makes sexual innuendos or comments before a first date or a long, long time speaking if it's long distance. I will not have sex on the first date. It's made me feel like a caricature of a 1950's man.

"It gets worse before it gets better. Always.

The motto of mankind is ""hell is other people"". Very few people recognize they have any responsibility in any giver situation, even fewer recognize what this responsibility is. 

Almost every problem people have can be boiled down to a combination of lack os self-knowledge, lack of self-control and lack of disposition to accept the ill effects of getting your shit together.

We are taught to value ""freedom"" over our own well being, and the result is a world where everyone, no exceptions, is far less autonomous than they think they are. We are slaves of what the world wants of us, but we the same world teaches us to think we are ""free"", and every single one of us will destroy ourselves before admiting we need help.

People seek therapy looking for excuses not to change or for someone to tell them the answers. Our job is helping them to help themselves, and the hardest part is generally to convince them that they do need to change and that they need to make their own choices.

Almost everything you call ""mental disease"" are, in fact, symptoms. OCD, PTSD, depression, anxiety, you choose. All of these are consequences, the causes are deep and complicated systems of behavioral patterns that need to be studied down to its function. 

The WHY and the HOW are much, much more important than the WHAT.

I can go on and on if you want me to. These are just from the top of my head.

I hear that shit constantly: school, college, home, summer jobs, probably when I start working in a few months I'll hear that shit too. And no, I'm not strong, I'm actually very weak, there are women stronger than me. But if I dare to refuse I'll be called a selfish asshole who can't ever help a woman out. I'll be yelled at in front a large gathering of people as if I just told someone to go fuck themselves. Not to mention that I have some problems with my spine, so lifting exceptionally heavy things kind of hurts and sometimes there's some serious discomfort. Sometimes I bother explaining it, sometimes I don't, because people usually think I'm either faking it or trying to 'weasel out of it' or it's not serious or the classic 'what do you mean, but you're a man! power through it, you can handle it' So explaining it is a whole thing that would take up quite some time and patience that I don't always have.

And I get that women have their own bullshit that is expected of them. It's just that me being me, it'd be much easier to deal with those than my own."

"That makes sense though. Most of what people want to pay taxes FOR  are for the government to have 'public good' systems - universal healthcare, for example. By raising taxes everyone is obligated to pay more into a system so that everyone, including the poorest and most disadvantaged, can benefit. Thus paying your taxes IS donating to those in need.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Meanwhile Republicans think being 'obligated' to do anything is kind of bullshit. It's not like most republicans believe no one ever deserves any help, they just think help should be given through private enterprise and be given voluntarily, thus those that want to help donate to charities.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Basically Democrats are like ""Why should I donate to charities? I pay my taxes!"" and Republicans are like ""Why should I have to pay those taxes? I donate to charities!"""

We spent the next 45 minutes hugging each other while she cried about her brother. "

"Fuck the Dealer.

&gt;Someone starts off as the dealer.
People get two guesses to guess the value of the top card on the deck. After the first guess, the dealer tells them if the card is higher or lower than their first guess. The dealer is not allowed to lie!
Aces are low…
If the player guesses correctly on the first guess the dealer takes 4 drinks. If guessed right on the second guess the dealer takes 2 drinks.
Cards are then laid out on the table for people to see what’s left in the deck.
If the player is still wrong on their second guess the player has to drink the difference between their second guess and the value of the card. E.g. if the player guessed 5 and the card was a 2, they would take 3 drinks.
Once the dealer has beaten 3 people IN A ROW, the deck moves on clockwise to the next person.

"This isn't NSFW in the traditional lewd sense, but one time I picked up a guy who seemed to be in a horrible mood, and he kept urging me to drive faster, telling me he doesn't care if I speed or pass people, etc. He was clutching a small bag to his chest and staring ahead angrily. It was almost an hour drive to the middle of nowhere but thankfully he had a phone call right after he got in the car to distract him as I flew down the highway. Naturally I listened to his conversation (driving gets boring, after all) and it was something about his ex-wife, his car had been repossessed, etc, and it seemed he was talking to a lawyer or something, didn't seem like a friend. After a while he hangs up the phone and looks out the window in a huff, and then explains to me that his ex-wife had gotten his truck repo'd because he was apparently one day late on a payment, and his car had his money, PTSD meds, etc. I tried to reassure him as much as possible and tone down the conversation but he was, understandably, very angry. He then started ranting about the repo guys, who were just outside county lines (hence the long drive) and how he wanted to shoot up the place. Understanding now why he was clutching his bag, this made me a little nervous, and thankfully I was able to lighten the mood a bit and hopefully convince him not to go on a shooting spree. He then rants about his ex-wife and kids, and says he wants to put a bullet in her head, and that of her lawyer, and I remember saying something like this will only make your problems worse, and he says it doesn't matter since he's off his PTSD meds so is insane. We're like 15 minutes from his destination by now and I really have no idea what to do besides try to identify with this guy while talking him down and being nice/understanding. I end the ride and offer to go in with him to the repo place if he needs a hand getting his truck and he agrees, we get his truck and the people had stolen all of his cash but not his meds, thankfully, and he was holding back tears. This was a very surreal experience.

If they think just going to school is ""so hard like omg you won't believe how hard"" then they're fucking delusional.

"The lab at my school had a person employed whose whole job was to ensure the live animals were treated in a way that met legal guidelines.

It's certainly not easy to kill animals, especially intelligence ones like rats, who you have developed a relationship with over time, and whose death (in our lab at least) had to be done using a method that we honestly didn't know if it was painful or not.

"When I read Amazon reviews, I always go straight for the 3-star reviews.  These are generally the ones that evaluate both the positives and negatives and give a balanced review -- and I can decide whether the positives or negatives matter to me.

That said, I'll peek at the one-star reviews (if there are a lot of them), because they often reveal a problem or defect that is common.

"Not a boss or manager, but there was a point where I worked for this electronics retail company that I was respected as one.

There was this dude who worked for the company for about 6 years. He was going to school, so promotions were out of the question for him. At one point he was the pride and joy of management because he never took the customers shit and was a great salesmen. However... when it came to new people who did something better than him, he would get jealous. It got to the point where he would train the new guys wrong so that he could get their sales and have them viewed as terrible employees by management. It wasnt until I came along. He tried to teach me incorrectly, but I would always go around and ask other people just for in case. So it got to he point where I would pretend to listen to him and just do my job correctly. He would tell lies to the employees, even experienced ones, so that he could take their sales. He even tried to bullshit new management so that his sales would increase. 

I called him out on his BS during a company wide meeting. He wanted to fight me. A week later he quits his job, pretended to say he got a better job because he graduated school, then came back a year later because he was broke as a joke."

If the sign was flat out sold, independent of any such clause, presumably first-sale doctrine applies and he can sell the sign to anyone else.

"I prefer to be on more equal footing at least financially with my partner. I guess for me it's more rooted in an element of fear. Our relationship is good, but I sleep easier knowing that if he ever decided to leave me that I could support myself financially without any issues. 

One of my good friends is currently going through a divorce. When her daughter was born she wanted to be a stay at home mom and her husband encouraged that. Now 6 years later, she's struggling to make ends meet, worrying about how much she'll get for child and spousal support and is having a really tough time getting back into the job market. I guess I just never want to be dependent on someone else that way. "
"Most of the time, this is borne out of parent-child interactions.  Especially when a kid is 4-8 years old, they don't really want an explanation, they just want to delay.  So they are eager to ask for increasingly convoluted explanations for every parental decision.

""Put your shoes on.""

""Why, I don't want to put my shoes on.""

""We're going to Grandma's, so put your shoes on.""

""Why do we have to go to Grandma's now?""

""Because we told her we would, so put your shoes on so we can go.""

""Why do I have to wear shoes?""

""Because you'll cut your feet.""

""No I won't, I'll be careful.""

""No, put your shoes on so we can go.""

And so forth.  The kid just wants to delay, and by arguing, they get what they want.  "

"Actually, they *have* rebooted the series. Agents of Mayhem features Oleg and Pierce as playable characters and Persephone is the antagonist I think. It stems from one of the Gat Outta Hell endings where the Saints Row universe is rebooted and the Saints are now cops instead of gangsters. Gat is a pre-order bonus for that game unfortunately.

EDIT: Persephone is *not* the antagonist, she's the MAYHEM leader, the player's team."
"Is the way many developed countries treat their elderly that gets me, I'm in the uk and once went for an interview at a care home, they offered me the job and I asked to be shown around before accepting. They were very reluctant to but eventually they did.

I saw at least 5 elderly people sitting on their beds, they'd clearly soiled themselves, when I asked how long it took for them to be changed the manager simply replied ""whenever carers have time, they deserve a break too""

Noped the fuck out of there and reported them to CQC, after investigating, they were shut down."

"According to Vince Gilligan

&gt;Man, I don’t see it that way at all. We’ve been at events and had all our actors up onstage, and people ask Anna Gunn, “Why is your character such a bitch?” And with the risk of painting with too broad a brush, I think the people who have these issues with the wives being too bitchy on Breaking Bad are misogynists, plain and simple. I like Skyler a little less now that she’s succumbed to Walt’s machinations, but in the early days she was the voice of morality on the show. She was the one telling him, “You can’t cook crystal meth.” She’s got a tough job being married to this asshole. And this, by the way, is why I should avoid the Internet at all costs. People are griping about Skyler White being too much of a killjoy to her meth-cooking, murdering husband? She’s telling him not to be a murderer and a guy who cooks drugs for kids. How could you have a problem with that?

"I had a similar near drowning experience when I was about 4 or so.  I was with my mother, grandmother and brother at a local hotel pool and I remember stepping too far back and losing my balance in the shallow end and falling back into the water that was just over my head.  I remember trying desperately to grab the edge of the pool, but couldn't because I didn't know how to swim and kept going under the water.  I looked over to try and yell to my mother, but she was more focused on my younger brother.  And then all of a sudden this strange guy who walked into the pool room saw me struggling and going under and came in to get me.  Saved by a random stranger when my own family was 6 feet from me, not paying attention."

"I was the best pianist our college had when I started there. I did a lot more stuff than any previous player. I also played jazz, which no one else did.

Then came two girls who graduated high school early. One of them was just under my level when she started. Within the semester, she blew past me. The teachers kept loading her up with crazy shit and she just went with it. 

Incredible pianist. I've had the pleasure of playing duo with her several times. She's got almost a full ride at a pretty prestigious music school next year since she just graduated here.

Meanwhile, I backed down on piano because I couldn't do with the stress of constantly learning really hard shit. Totally my decision not effected by her at all. It isn't enjoyable for me if it's all study. So I started over doing Audio Technology.

If that girl wasn't there to blow me the fuck away with her skills, I wouldn't have found what my true passion is."

Life was really going his way and everyone had high hopes and expectations for him. 

Then one day he was running laps during his sports conditioning and he fell over, dead on the spot. His heart had thick artery walls, and this issue is stressed by physical activity and is capable of causing spontaneous death via rupture. 

He was the love of my life and a dear friend, and one day he randomly died because his heart was literally too big.

Cue being completely bored of your mind because there is no music (at least at my pool), no books, no nothing. You think there's plenty to think about, until you run out of things 2 hours into your work day/get tired of talking to your brain. 

Cue being baked to death in 95 degree heat and constantly sweating, and being completed exhausted on the 3 minute drive home and falling asleep as soon as you open the door to your bedroom.

One day my mom came home early and heard me rehearsing. She told me later that I sounded like a cat dying, howling away. That was the last day I sang out loud, until I had children.

"This was a few years back, was sleeping on a fold out bed at my grandparents house. The layout was thus: Living room in which I was sleeping. Two doorways, one leading to the kitchen, one leading to the rest of the house and the bathroom. You have to turn a corner to get through that second door.

The time was 2 am. I was up for most of the night sitting on my phone, and I needed to take a dump. I got up to go, and I didn't turn on any lights because I didn't want to wake anyone up. My grandparents dog, Tuna, was also sleeping on a chair near the bathroom. I took my dump, and began to return to bed. I opens the door to the bathroom, walked out, turned the corner, and smashed my face against the empty air.

I fell back and hit the ground hard. My nose was bleeding. I look up and see the empty hallway, leading back towards the living room. There was nothing I could have run into, no door, no wall. I looked around trying to see if it was my grandpa, who had a habit of sleeping walking. No, I heard his snoring from the other end of the hallway. I turned back around and see the glowing eyes of Tuna, the dog.

He wasn't looking at me though.

He was looking at the empty air that I had just walked into. And softly whimpering.

I panicked and ran back to bed, this time, not being impeded by anything. Tuna continued to whimper for hours. Needless to say, I didn't really sleep that night.

The next morning early, I mentioned it to my grandpa, and he laughed it off, blaming it on my being tired. I laughed too, and went to take Tuna out to use the facilities, i.e. the front lawn.

As I approached the dog, I saw him still sitting in his chair, not running around like usual. I put my hand on him. He was cold. He was dead. 


And before you ask, yes, all this did happen, and it appears that Tuna had some sort of heart attack. He was about 11, and had been ill, but was still a very active dog. 

Edit: For anyone wondering, Tuna was indeed a Pug, specifically a pug/beagle mix. He was very nice lol. Thanks for the doggie love!"
"When I was 10 years old there was a kid from school I used to hang out with. We lost touch, but we started hanging out again, and he had a new friend. They were both a couple of years older than me; I met the old friend in a school where I skipped a grade, and he was left behind, and his new friend was 2 years older than him, and they were both twice my size.

One day they asked me to hang out at new friend's house. I had been there a few times, so I didn't think anything of it. 

I get there, and things just felt ... off. We were hanging out in his bedroom. They asked me, ""what's your biggest fear?"" And I struggled to think of something. ""Claustraphobia"" I said, so the took a blanket and trapped me underneath it for a few minutes while I screamed. 

I struggled out of it and I said I wanted to go home. They said ""we're not going to let that happen."" 

So I looked at the door, and I noticed they removed the door knob from the door. 

Then I overheard them talking about putting my body in a suitcase. I was like ""oh my fucking god, this is about to get bad."" 

So I started mapping out a plan in my mind about how to escape. Since I liked to tinker with electronics and machines, I had a pretty decent idea about how physical objects and mechanisms worked. 

I looked at the nub of the door knob, had a decent idea of the door's weight, and knew the general plan of the guy's house. I created an escape plan and recited it in my head over and over again until I had it as a single, smooth process. 

My old friend was guarding me while the other guy went into his closet to look for a suitcase to put my body in. Fortunately he was an idiot, and he got into the suitcase itself to see how big it was, and he got stuck in it. 

So he called to the other guy to help him get out, so I waited until the were both in the closet, and I made my break for it, executing the plan I practiced in my mind. I raced out of the house and they chased after me, and I ran like a motherfucker back to my house. 

When I got home my parents just chuckled at me, because the were the ones who encouraged me to hang out with those guys in the first place. A few months later my brother brought the guy who kidnapped me home and my entire family tormented me together. 

When I ran into my old ""friend"" after college, he apologized to me, and told me the other guy ended up going to federal prison for 6 years for attempted murder. 

Cool news to hear that. I still never got treatment for it, either. Gave me a lifetime of agoraphobia and fear that I still haven't overcome, even in my 30s, especially since that happened because of my parents. My family thought it was hilarious. They still think it's funny.

I'm screaming the pleasure out of my lungs and then someone was at the door knocking really hard. It was my little brother  back from school(8-9 at the time) screaming to let him in because he want to play X-box. I'm about to cum so we keep doing it and I still keep moaning like crazy. After a while the knocking stop so I thought my brother already gave up and went to his friend house next door. I'm already finished by then and continue going down on my ex. Just before my ex about to come, I hear a foot steps coming from the top floor. It was my little brother. That little shit climb his way to the second floor with a ladder and get inside through a window. My ex wasn't aware of this situation blew his load on my face while I'm still trying to process the situation. My little brother just ran pass us and turn on his x-box and said ""don't worry I didn't see anything. Me and my ex decided to move to my bedroom and went for round 2.

"When growing up everyone used some sort of variation on my name, turning it into sort of a nickname.

If I know you mean me when you say something remotely close to my name, or if I know everyone who's concerned about documents you put my name on knows the spelling supposed to mean me, I couldn't care less what you call me.

"There was a gay bar in college that would let minors in on amateur strip night (where a bunch of hot sorority chicks get on stage and strip). We'd go and pregame beforehand and then head over to it. After the strip show was done the place turned into a huge dance party. One this particular night I had a lot of whiskey in me and decided to get up on stage and dance after the show. This girl comes up to me and starts grinding on me and eventually grabs my hand and guides it between her legs. And it stayed there for four songs or so while people around us watched.

TLDR: Went to gay bar dance party, fingerblasted chick on stage while people watched. "

"Not a divorce lawyer, but went through a really messy one for no reason.

My Ex came from a very wealthy family and her and her sister had huge sibling rivalry issues.  To the point where I had broken up a physical altercation between the two of them when they were both in their 30's.  When the sister made accusations of abuse against her husband and got divorced the family started paying a lot of attention to her (I knew her husband and have a very hard time believing the ""abuse"", he had custody of his child from a previous marriage).  2 months later my Ex stopped talking to me for almost 30 days.  When I had enough, I informed her that I was going to get a hotel room for a couple of days so we could both cool off.  I came back on Monday Morning to a house with all my personal things piled on my side of the garage and the locks changed on the house.  Called the cops to see what I could do and the cop asked me if my name was on the deed and if I had tools.  I removed one of the locks from one of the doors because she wouldn't give me a key.

She did things like try to stop me from removing a family Heirloom from the property to return to my family as I knew I would be moving.  She stalled us out until time for my kids to come home from School (Kindergarten and 2 Grade) so the cops would be there, than she had the gaul to ask the cops if they would take her to the corner to pick up the kids so they could ""ride in a cop car"", they just looked at her like she was crazy.

My son at 7 years old called the cops on her once because she threw the dog at the entertainment center in their house and broke one of the doors on it.  Of course, she talked her way out of that.

She called me one evening when my 6 year old daughter and her had gotten in a fight and told me to come get her now.  She didn't let her take anything but the clothes on her back.

She spent around $100,000 trying to bankrupt me and throw me in jail.  She was partially successful, but I have a lot of friends (for some reason people like me, I'm not sure why).  She did everything she could to break up any personal relationships I had with friends and my family (again she was partially successful in this).

She called me a week after school got out at 10PM on a Saturday Night (I was broke and mopping my kitchen floor) and informed me that she was dropping my Son off for the summer and would be there in 10 Minutes.  It was one of the best Summers of my life.

She introduced her Step Daughters (Middle Schooler and High Schooler) to one of our mutual friends that she ran into as ""My Hairy Stepdaughters.""

3 months before I got remarried (to an absolute Angel) she convinced my Daughter to make false accusations of abuse against me (I guess she was trying to stop my wedding).  Went through all the investigations including my son being interviewed and came out clean on the other side (whew, dodged a bullet there).  I haven't seen my daughter since (almost 10 years now).

She was so abusive to my son over the years that he developed some pretty serious mental issues and has been in and out of hospitals for the last 6, almost 7 years.

Not to mention that my son came to live with me at 14 and I still had to pay $500/month in Child Support even though her family is worth Millions.  She drove around in a New Lexus and owned two houses (one of which I signed over to her in the divorce), while my son and I lived in a 2 bedroom hole (but we were happy).

This is only a small highlight reel, there were worse things and more stories than I can list here.  All told, I figure the divorce cost me roughly $250,000 over the course of about 6 or 7 years.  I'm just a working stiff and that is a lot of money to me.

On the upside, I somehow convinced the most Wonderful Woman in the World to marry me.  I still have my son in my life.  I have 2 beautiful Grand Children from my Wife's Daughter that I get to spend at least 1 day every week with.  I consider myself to be very lucky indeed."
"She took a very large hit on the bong, so large it got brown in the tube where the smoke collects and you inhale from. She then proceeded to tilt the bong, presumably still with smoke in it, and drank all the (probably super nasty) water out of it. Then she removed the bowl (the piece you see movie stoners light that has the actual... uh... tobacco in it) making it such that when she inhaled the bong would have more airflow and hence a faster hit. She then inhaled all the smoke out of the bong with a single hit. This is not normal behavior. "

"When buying a used car, definitely get the Carfax.  But also definitely, and I mean DEFINITELY take the car to a dealership to have a pre-purchase inspection done. So for instance if you're wanting to buy a Prius, take the car in question to a Toyota dealer.  Call the service dept and make the appointment, they will know what you're talking about. If the seller refuses, walk away.  Even if they agree, the dealer may find significant problems. It's an insurance that costs you about $200 but can save you thousands. 

If you have a moment, read my personal story below.

I live in Chicago and have a long commute to the suburbs, so wanted to buy a used Prius.  I found a good price (15K) on Craigslist for a 2yr old Prius. Seller gave me the VIN for Carfax, which checked out clean.  I asked if I could test drive it and take it to a nearby Toyota dealer, which he happily agreed.  After sitting in the waiting room for over an hour, the mechanic comes in and says ""Sir, are you really thinking about buying this car?"".  He then gives me a laundry list of significant problems including two frame-bending accidents, and extensive electrical issues.  He explained that people will buy totalled cars, then do repairs themselves or have friends do repairs so that Carfax is not allerted.  I think they call these 'rebuilt' titles.  When I brought it back to the seller, he did not deny it, he just laughed and said someone else will buy it, and he's probably right.  Dickhead cost me $200 but the inspection saved me $15000  I still see the seller's ads all the time on CL, he always has multiple cars for sale.  Some he outright labels ""rebuilt title""  others, he doesn't.  So I imagine they are all rebuilds.

Carfax is not enough.  Get the inspection.


TLDR: don't trust Carfax, bring a used car to a dealer for pre-purchase inspection."

The sudden shock of the cold water releases chemicals that can help solve a bad move, and overcome depression or lethargic tendencies. As for the testosterone, it's said that standing in an ice cold shower in the morning willingly is alpha as fuck. That's my two cents! You feel amazin after stepping out of one."

"I was on the receiving end in this case. I was working at a Thai restaurant. I didn't have a whole lot of experience, but most of the employees were from Thailand, and they needed a frontman who spoke good English. 

One day, not many people were coming in, so one of the managers asked me in busted-up English to help cut chicken. Medium-thin pieces, not much instruction. So, I followed the other sous-chef's example. Apparently, that was too thick.

The manager came back in and lost it. She started by loudly saying they were too thick, while holding up fistfuls of raw chicken and throwing a few pieces on the floor and in the sink like a four year old. I could see customers coming to the front so I told her we'll continue this later, but she blocked the exit and continued to rant.

Next, she paced around the kitchen while grumbling and pulling at her hair with her raw chicken covered hands, ignoring the line of customers. Eventually, she sent the sous chef, who didn't speak much English, to the front, and demanded I stir a big pot of soup for the rest of the day.

As I was stirring the soup, she went back to chastising me in some language I couldn't understand, pacing, and grumbling in a tone your parents may have used when you pissed the bed at age three. 

She then looked at the chicken on the cutting board, turned to me and said ""We can't let (the boss) see this"". She then proceeded to pick up pieces of chicken, toss them onto the drain in the middle of the kitchen floor, and started waffle-stomping them through the grate. 

I angrily told her stop it and grow up, but she shot back with ""Back to pot!"" in a glass-shattering voice, and continued to stomp the chicken down the drain. After she had stomped a bunch of chicken down the drain, it clogged, so she waddled over to the sink and started mashing pieces of chicken down that drain with her greasy palm.

She harassed me for the rest of the day, and kept coming back up to me with pieces of chicken in her hands, then holding them inches from my face and yelling about how thick they were. 

As she started angrily hacking away at the rest of the chicken with a cleaver, she kept muttering ""If (our boss) was here, he would say 'You're fired!' is what he would say!"" When people out front ordered chicken dishes, I heard her apologizing ""Oh, I so sorry the chicken so ugly, fucking (I) cut it so bad! I not know why (our boss) not fire him!""

Eventually, our boss comes back, and here's what he sees: The soup I'm stirring is burnt, and none of the dishes are done. I tried a few times to turn the soup off and start the dishes, but she'd come charging back in brandishing a rice paddle screeching ""Back to pot! Back to pot!"" Also, the sous chef who doesn't speak English is out front having a terrible day.

The manager tried to cover her ass, but our boss went through the security footage and saw the whole thing. He told the sous chef and I we could leave early, and we heard them yelling in some language I couldn't understand as we left.

The next day, the health inspector came. Imagine his surprise when he walked in to the smell of rotting chicken, while two employees were fishing mangled pieces of chicken out of the floor and sink drain. The inspector nearly reported the restaurant. The current manager was fired soon thereafter. 

**TL;DR:** Manager freaks out about chicken being cut too thick, wastes food, got the health inspector called."

It's about how there's secret gatherings where connected guys in Hollywood take advantage of naive kids trying to make it in show business. That was really eye-opening. 

Bryan Singer (of X-Men and The Usual Suspects fame) was one of the main offenders named in this documentary. It makes me question the moral judgement of people like Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart when they're still willing to work with Singer again after those allegations had been made.

"Oh fuck me.  My girlfriend's sister who I live with as well (don't ever do this, but whatever) got their brother a job last month, working where she works, and she (sister, not my gf) is his boss now.

He moved in with us for just under 2 weeks because he had to find his own place after moving for the job, and she was giving him lifts to work.

He failed to shower almost daily and it turns out he was just using water and not the shower gel bought for him, never used deodorant or anti-perspirant, and about 4 or 5 times she was late because she had to iron a shirt for him as he had just picked up the shirt he wore the day before, all scrunched up and wrinkled etc.

He was staying in the spare room (more a study than anything with a day bed in it from Ikea) and it just...fucking stank after a few days.  We told him daily to open the window.  It reeked.  Like that wet clothes and unwashed, sweaty sheets stink.  It was agreed he would only be there a week, but that turned in to 2 because he didn't bother to set up room viewings around town.  We had to find one for him.  At that point I was helping, just to get him the fuck out.  His clothes were all over the floor, he never folded them, nothing.  Just let them fall where they fell, and had his suitcases open and covered in bundles of clothes.  He didn't even hang his towel every day, just left it in a damp pile on the floor.

He's 22.  It baffles me how fucking unaware someone can be about how to live when you have a proper office job.

"Fellow bisexual here...

&gt;It can be easier to divide labor in a household, since there are expectations for both parties roles already.

This is absolutely not a plus for me! I fucking hate gendered chore expectations since invariably more falls on the woman &amp; it's all the repetitive daily bitchwork usually. I'm so glad my BF doesn't follow gendered norms in that regard.

I agree with everything else you wrote though - especially about how not-really-different it is. I find the biggest difference is just how others around you perceive you, and how physically safe you feel in public. Being an effeminate woman in a gay relationship I got a lot of sexual harassment as well as occasional angry homophobia (I imagine for gay male relationships and for butch lesbians, angry homophobia is a lot more common). Besides that, and sometimes the gendered expectations of men (which turned me off instantly in every case), it's basically exactly the same. For me, dating itself wasn't all that different, but I'm a woman; the gay male dating scene seems like a different planet."

"This is a personal one for me, but both my parents pretty much suck through and through. This is pretty long, so tl;dr at the end. 

Parents divorced when I was three. Dad was an abusive alcoholic executive in the transportation industry (read: he has money-important later), mom was hiding bipolar and narcissistic personality disorder and hadn't held job since high school. Dad remarries right after finalization and had gotten stepmom pregnant before divorce was even final. My siblings and I move-mom has custody of us. Dad gets the summer and winter breaks. All is amicable for a while, especially after dad gives up the bottle and finds Jesus. 

Mom is abusive as fuck to us throughout our childhood. Anything not bolted down is likely able to be used to beat us with. During family gatherings, my mom and my aunts and uncles would tell these stories about hitting their kids too like they're all trying to one-up each other. They were raised on this shit as it's the only way my grandma knew how to parent-spare the rod and spoil the child type shit, and they carried on the tradition.

After 9/11, when I was 13, mom and dad became more genial towards each other. We got more visits and trips to see dad. It was a good time, until the summer just before I started high school. My brother and I were grounded. Mom took little sister shopping and he and I snuck out and went skateboarding. We got back just as my mom was pulling up. She chased us inside the house and beat the shit out of us with our boards, or tried to, at least. My older sister came over a couple days later and saw the bruises on us and told dad secretly. A week later at the skatepark, a friend runs up to me and hands me her cell phone-my mom is on the line and tells me to come home because ""your father is starting shit again"". I ride up and there are four county sheriff squad cars outside the house, with the whole neighborhood looking on. A deputy tells me to pack a bag for the weekend because dad is here to take us. 

Me and my siblings get in three separate squad cars and drive a couple blocks away to a church parking lot where my dad is waiting inside a limo with my older sister and her fiancé. He gets out and runs up to hug me and is obviously fake crying and apologizing. I have no clue wtf is going on at this point.

Fast forward six months-parents are engaged in an epic custody battle. Three times a week, my siblings and I have to go to counseling, therapy, and meet with our guardian ad litem (GAL), along with weekend plane trips back and forth to dad's state from our state-900 miles away. Like I said, dad had money. We were all still in school, too-6th, 8th, and 9th grade. The judge was getting sick of the back and forth, so he ordered my dad to move into our house and my mom had to move out because she wasn't allowed to live with us alone-we had an uncle living with us 24/7 up until then. The judge wanted to see if he could handle raising kids on his own. Bad move-my little sister was taking things the hardest. She and dad would get into spats daily, and one night, they went at it really badly and they were on the verge of a fistfight. The next day, he takes her to a psych ward at a hospital and has her committed. Judge finds out, and ends the experiment.

I guess after that, it wasn't going too well on my dad's side. He was getting sick of the court proceedings dragging on, so in the end, he decided to pay off our counselor and therapist over $15k each to sway their statements to the court in his favor to earn custody. My moms lawyers discovered it while going through financial statements. Dad loses. Mom wins, but is ordered to never lay a finger on us and if she does, we call our GAL and she loses us. 

My siblings and I still lost in the end, because instead of using physical violence, she just used psychological and mental abuse until one by one, we all moved the fuck out of her house when we turned 18. I haven't spoken to her in nearly ten years and don't plan to. Dad tries to come back in every once and a while, but he doesn't give a shit about his kids from his first marriage, which was painfully obvious then and now. 

**Edited to add TL;DR:** parents divorce, mom is abusive, dad is nonexistent. Mom goes overboard one day and is snitched on by my older sister. My siblings and I get put through hell for almost a year of our young lives, being shuttled back and forth from two states. Dad pays off court-appointed mental health professionals, gets caught, loses. Nothing changes for us kids until we can move out and cut contact from our parents.

"I saw a future-ex-wife fight vigorously over disability benefits of a not-yet-retired career military guy. She had a new guy to bankroll her, and legal fees were nothing to her, so she dragged out asset division/divorce proceedings for months over not-yet-accrued disability benefits of her soon-to-be ex-husband. Total amount to which she would've been entitled: about $400 (that is before the Supreme Court decided disability benefits are not marital property). It was some very petty bullshit.

I had this class right after lunch so I was pretty baked and had no fucks to give. I started talking to her like she was literally anyone else and she would politely have a conversation with me. The next day I found out that she was (a junior at the time) well on her way to becoming the Valedictorian of her graduating class and that she was also the Varsity Volleyball captain.

Anyway, after a few days of casual chatting I passed her the corniest note. I made it corny on purpose because I was the no fucks given HS rebel skater dude. I can't remember what I wrote exactly but I'll never forget her response.

"Hooked up and hit it off with a girl at a school party. We had completely different schedules so we were almost never at school at the same time so we didn't meet till my junior year, she was a senior. Not my usual type, but very cute, very sexy, and super fun to talk with. I'm thinking, it was a little early to say, but this chick definitely has girlfriend potential, but I just met her, so get to know her better. We hung out again the day after the party and I mentioned I worked at a pharmacy off of a certain street but gave no other information beyond that. This street crosses the whole fairly large city we live in and has dozens of pharmacies. Couple days later she shows up to my work, I'm a bit shocked and instead of greeting her, i say ""how did you find out where I work?"" She panics and says, ""oh, uhm wrong business! Uhhhh, see you later..."" and runs out the door. So after one party hook up and hanging out one day this girl went to a bunch of pharmacies until she found the one I worked at. At this point I decide to stop calling her, and since it was the 90s, this was pre-cell phones being ubiquitous and caller ID wasn't too common yet, so she didn't have my number. I was like she's nuts, I'm done. Somehow she figured out who my sister was and starts sending me these love letters through her. My sister comes home and says, ""hey this girl asked me to give you this envelope, I bet it's a love letter."" I tell my sister to never give her any information about me because she's nuts, but she must have sent me love letters through her at least once a month, often more, well after she graduated. The random crazy letters finally stopped when I took a friend with benefits out on a date (I tried very hard to turn that other one into a relationship, but that's a different story), and we go into this random restaurant and guess who I notice is one of the waitresses? I tell my date, ""oh shit! We gotta get out of here, that waitress is crazy girl!"" She laughs and says, ""no I wanna meet her!"" I'm like, please let's leave before she sees us. She agrees and as we are leaving she sees me through the window holding hands with this other girl and starts crying while serving a table and runs to the back of the restaurant. Luckily I never saw this girl ever again."

I am not diagnosed, but I'm pretty sure I am on the dyslexia spectrum somewhere.  I'm 34 and still say right when I mean left. I am also a professional electrical engineer and still don't have the multiplication tables memorized (pretty much proof, if you ask me).   Anyway, in grade school I was struggling with the tables in math class and my dad sat down and wrote out a bunch of multiplication problems in a notebook and had me sit at the table and work them out.  When i started struggling, he became visibly and audibly agitated, which my brother and I knew was basically a death sentence.  Anyway, after shouting ""what is 7 times 8?"" At me a handful of times, he backhanded my face so hard that it spiked off the table leaving imprints of harley davidson rings on my right face and spiral notebook lines on my left.  For scale, i had personally witnessed my beast of a father bench press 400lbs.  Another time was that he asked me to lay a shirt over a chair to avoid it wrinkling.  He closed fist blasted me in the back of the skull for doing it wrong.  I could go on and on.

The rule was that you must always perform to his standard, which was impossibly high for a 9 year old and unstated before you begin a task.  Shortly after my 10th birthday he got pissed about custody and kicked my mom's door in and shot her twice before killing himself.  He didn't care that i was watching or what would happen to me after he orphaned me.

Reading through these posts, a lot of these are clear cut cases of child abuse.  For those people, you should know that your parents are fucked up.  Don't blame yourself for the bullshit they pull(ed).  I hope that you are all living the lives you want now and doing what you want, when you want.  For those still under their parent's thumb, just ride it out.  It will get better."

"Just how much you appreciate things and getting all the usage you can out of the things it took saving money for.

Meanwhile I knew kids at school that would drop their system in a heartbeat and go get whatever console had just come out. "

Creepiest thing? Friends came over to hang out, one walked into the room after a bit, saw my other friend and freaked out saying he just ""saw him sitting in a chair"" in the other room. We went to look and obviously nobody was there, we brushed it off. What freaked me out was when another friend said they thought ""I was in the other room""  on a different day. 

Oh and also when my friends little sister stared at the end of a hall way, getting more and more distressed until she started screaming and burying her face into my friends shoulder. We asked what's wrong, she  said there's a tall guy pointing and laughing at us. We got the fuck out of that building (we were exploring the city) "

Even though they were stale, and the frosting was all gooped and mixed up on the bottom of the bag and not on the doughnuts themselves, those were  one of my top 5 favorite things.

"This is nonsense. To run some crude numbers the most executions on earth (other than China) were in Iran, which executed 314 people in 2012 (https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/29/death-penalty-countries-world) compared to the USA's 43. There is no way in hell the disparity of thousands of prisoners (even accounting for population size) between the USA and Iran (the USA has 2-3 times the incarceration rate) can be explained by Iran executing 250 more people a year. China is the only country where there might be enough executions to make a blip in the prison population statistics, but assuming high end estimates of 5000 a year, as they don't release official data, this would take stopping over 100 years of executions for the US and Chinese prison populations to be the same size and the USA would still have a far higher incarceration rate for obvious reasons.

The US having the highest incarceration rate in the world is a problem of the US and nobody else. Feel free to argue that other countries have worse justice systems or whatever, but don't pretend that they are responsible for statistics making the US look appropriately terrible."

There is a Psych movie coming out later this year. 
"I live off a small country road that runs through open range cattle land between my house and the highway. My sister was 45 minutes late to school because of two bulls fighting in the road. There's only one road that runs from my house to the highway and no other exit to the area so no way to go around. Pre-cell phone but fortunately it's a small town so when my mom told the school what happened, they believed it. "
"I don't know if this will help in your efforts to not get frustrated, but some self-perspective from a person who struggles with these exact things, it comes from having a mother who would chew out retail workers, waitresses, and even the staff at my schools at the slightest offense. I remember standing by my mom's side, feeling so embarrassed by their loud outbursts, wanting to melt into a wall or make eye contact with the service member and telepathically project ""I DO NOT ENDORSE THIS BEHAVIOR.""

And in not wanting to emulate her, I've gone 180 degrees the other direction, even in situations where me speaking up is totally justified. Now that I've recognized it, I'm trying my best to correct it, but it's still difficult. I remember agonizing over a decision last year whether or not to walk back into the store when -- in the parking lot -- I realized that they didn't apply several cereal coupons to my purchase (a $10 difference). I remember thinking ""this is stupid. it's just cereal. i've already left the store. they'll think i'm petty."" And when I finally did march up to the customer service counter, they gave me the $10 in like... 30 seconds. No drama. And that positive experience helps me with future experiences.

So basically, TL;DR, there's a chance your friends are self-aware of their behavior and are frustrated by it, but are too fearful of getting judged as rude by society to do anything about."

"We moved around alot when I was a kid so I met alot of people, but the strangest of all was this one little girl(the bird girl) who lived down the street from me when I was in 1st- 3rd grade. She was strange to begin with because this poorly dressed little girl collected dead birds. Litterally had a back yard full of rows of popsicle sticks with dates and and names for each bird she found dead (we had alot of stray cats). She had run out of room in the tiny yard and had to begin burying them two birds deep. As if that wasn't weird enough she took me inside her house one day... there was no furniture. They had lived there for years, but it looked like no one had even moved in yet. No couch, no chair, no table nothing personal laying around. Their living room had nothing in it but card board cut outs standing randomly around the room(probably just 10 of them spread out to fill the room evenly). Basketball players, actors, all just standing around like some weird collection of bystandars with nothing but a small path through the center of the ""crowd"". She tried to get me to come in to see the rest of the house, but I didn't feel comfortable walking through that. There was something weird and creepy about a house not actually being lived in by any real people."

"Not a driver, but I was having a smoke out front of my apartment when an Uber pulled up with a girl in the backseat, a neighbor from down the hall I recognized, who was screaming at the driver and refusing to get out of the vehicle. It sounded like she didn't want to pay him for the ride, and was demanding her cash back, which didn't make sense to me because Uber isn't a cash service? When she started hitting him, I phoned the police. Fifteen minutes later they showed up and she still hasn't left his vehicle. The cops drag her out and arrest her. Turns out she gave the driver a blowy on the way and thought that would get her a free fare, and was more than a little upset that she still had to pay. Girl never looked me in the eyes again when we passed in the hall.

I'd drive for Uber if it meant getting paid to get blowjobs."

"In my Dad's case it was because it was what my Mom wanted. They just celebrated their 42nd anniversary, but the night before their wedding was apparently the closest they ever came to breaking up. 

Mom was Christian, Dad was and still is an atheist. He was vehemently against getting married in a Church by a priest, but that was what the bride wanted so he went along with it, all the way up until the wedding rehearsal. They were going through the motions and the priest told them both ""This is the part where you kneel"".

Nope. Dad could handle the church stuff, but kneeling was just too much for him. He refused and said there was no way he was going to do it and the priest and my Mom got pissed at him. He walked out, but later that night they made up and he said he would meet her half way. When the priest told them to kneel during the wedding he just took a knee at the altar, not the full kneel.

I wish there was a picture of it because I would love to see my Dad in a tux looking up at the priest like he was a football coach during halftime in the locker room. 

On a somewhat related note, the priest who wed my parents ended up going to prison for diddling kids about 20 years later, so my Dad considers the kneeling was invalidated by a technicality. "

Opeth has since moved away from the growls, but this one is the symbol of death metal gone grandiose.

* **[Progenies of the Great Apocalypse - Dimmu Borgir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQSFpKG1les)** - This one was a hard choice, because Dimmu Borgir has so many epic and orchestral moments that could have gone here, but this song, like the previous one, shows how you can use growls and loud guitars to deliver masterful song writing."

"I think the food scenario is very different for families. I have a friend (best friend) who as a kid had to fend for himself to make meals, as did his brother and sister. The weirdest part was that he was an all-star track athlete, I would have thought his parents would want to make sure hes eating well. Nope, this dude would eat pickle sandwiches, or mayo sandwiches, or those noodles in a package. That was always weird to me because my mom and dad cooked meals every night to make sure we all had something good and hearty to eat, which was great because I did a lot of sports as well. Neither of our families were poor, in fact they were far better off than me. Just strange to see that. Now hes married and happily makes feasts on a regular basis, I eat there all the time. "

"My whole thing about the show is that the premise of the finale WOULD have worked IF they hadn't married Barney and Robin. They spent YEARS building that relationship... to the point where that's where people connected with the show. No one cared about the parade of women that they paired with Ted because those were clearly not the mother. A lot of people reacted so badly to the finale BECAUSE people liked Ted/Tracey AND they like Robin/Barney. I know I did. Watching the finale was like... They broke up Barney and Robin OFF SCREEN after spending the last 4 years leading to their wedding AND THEY KILLED OFF THE MOTHER after spending the last year making us care about her?

We had a fatal car accident that claimed the life of a senior at my high school.

They secured a used car from our local dealership as the grand prize for a raffle. That was the enticement for everyone to show up.  Long story short, I didn't have a driver's license at the time (I got one shortly thereafter) but I won the car. Had it for the next four years, it was a great beater of a car. "

"When I was younger, my ""old"" person was my baba, a first generation Canadian who spoke nothing but Ukrainian until her marriage to my great gido (they are both my great grandparents, but gido died before I was born).  

I remember being afraid of her when I was really little because I couldn't understand her, and it sounded like she was speaking nonsense words at me while pinching my face and tummy. As I got older, I understood more.

She never wore dresses or any fancy dress up clothes at all regardless of the occasion. She tended a huge garden at her house in town (which gido built from 2 box cars put together), as well as at the homestead. She always got up super early to bake bread, make pierogies, cookies, cabbage rolls, and borscht. I was the only one in the family who was able to learn how to make pierogies like her, because we have the same sized hands (she never used measuring cups).

She survived throat cancer through pure will and strength of spirit, probably only because she refused to acknowledge she had it (she had a frog in her throat) and was only going for special neck tans (radiation therapy).

The thing that got her finally was severe, sudden-onset dementia.  I got a tattoo of the molecular structure of the drug that calmed her enough to be who she was, even though she lost most of her short term memory. She most likely died because she wasn't able to be at home anymore.

In the end, she didn't know who I was, and I said my good byes before she was gone so I could have my last memory of her still appearing somewhat healthy. 

TL;dr: sorry, this ended up being more me remembering my baba than remembering what old people are like. "

"So it all started with me and a friend at a county fair. Here we are walking along, having some fried fair food and minding our own business. We start to stroll by the ""freak tent"" and having seen my fair share of pickled two-headed calves re-purposed as aliens I decided to give this one a skip. 

Lo and behold out from the tent comes a man whom I can only describe as the real life inspiration for redneck stereotypes. Now I don't know for sure how many teeth he had, but I know he could have counted them on one of his webbed hands. The man was something between greasy and slimy and the stench reminded me of a mixture of old eggs and Parmesan cheese. 

If this was the kind of attraction waiting in the tent then clearly I had been to hasty in my decision. 

So in we went. I don't know what we expected to find but inside the tent was a fat man spreading the asshole of a goat open with a pair of tongs. He looked at us and then back into the goat anus and then back at us again. ""reach in he said, and you'll discover the true secret to the universe.""

I don't know what came over me, some mystic power or sheer curiosity. So I reached in, and about that time a curtain opened. Turns out people will pay a lot of money to see a man shoulder deep in a goat. So I burnt the place to the ground and never went to a fair again.

Those mass media inventions have had a common effect worldwide of providing common mass culture to each distinct corner of most nations.

Except in the United States which seems to be culturally splitting more strongly during a period when mass media is increasing.  "

I would have left high school having never made a friend if it were not for them (and one girl in particular who introduced me to the rest of the group - we don't speak often these days due to our respective university courseloads but I still consider her one of the absolute most precious people in my life because of this).

Thing is, our little group isn't perfect. There's a girl who never wears short sleeves and never went swimming with us. There's been family issues - lots of. People have started off on the wrong foot on life or just simply had a hard time while trying their best. And when I confided in this girl that I once wanted to kill myself (not related to loneliness - this was something else) and how much everyone meant to me, she told me that everyone in our group had *something*. That's what really drove that home to me: everyone has *something*, doesn't necessarily have to be a mental illness, and I never felt more welcome in that instant."

I did it because I wanted to explore my sexuality, but didn't know how to find that kind of person otherwise. It led me to probably the weirdest situation I've ever found myself in.
The latter of the encounters was with a Japanese person. After we had done some business, we started talking about the language and I said I had been trying to learn it. So there I sat for atleast half an hour, dressed in womens undergarments in a dark room, getting a language lesson from a prostitute transgendered woman. It was the best part of the whole situation. After my ""time"" was up, she told me I was a really nice person, she let me use her shower and gave me some food."

"&gt;How much does what college you go to really matter?


I have found that it really is what you make of it. For example, somebody who graduates from a big well-known college with Cs I think will be worse off than someone who went to a smaller less-known college, worked hard, networked well and got As. Personally, I feel like its about what you do while attending college that sets you up for your future, not just the diploma. 

&gt;How much homework did you actually do?


Again this is something I feel like depends on your major. I highly reccomend  doing as much of your homework as possible (duh). Mostly because falling behind with homework can cause you to miss more and more assignments and that can snowball into a big problem. 

&gt;Is it really as wild as it seems? With parties everyday and shit going on in the dorms?



For me at least, no. It mostly depends on where you live. I remember my girlfriend her freshman year lived in a very quiet part of UMASS (which is know not be a party school). So I just thought that UMASS didn't live up to the hype. But then I visited one of my friends who lives in the most rowdy part of the campus and it did seem to get crazy most of the time. There definitely aren't parties every day. Probably just Friday or Saturday nights, and the occasional trip to the bars on Thursday. But definitely not every night. 

&gt;How the fuck do you manage keeping up grades, looking for internships for the summer maybe, working a job (for those who Don't get 1K of spending money from parents every week), having a SO (maybe) and keeping a social life?


Its hard. You just need to prioritize everything in your life. Organization becomes HUGE in college. I always tell myself while I'm doing homework that I really don't want to do or studying for a test that I really don't want to study for, ""Your future self is going to be really happy that you studied/did your homework right now."" So thats my advice really. Organize your time and do your homework even if you don't want to. Your future self will thank you for it.

&gt;What major did you do?


Communications/Sports Journalism. Not a lot of hard math or science tests in my time at school. But definitely a lot of hard British Literature exams and long papers (Im currently a junior).

"I had a mechanic do this to me last week. Car has been having brake issues and the wheel is shaking. He said I needed a new ABS, brake pads and rotors, and struts. He had the car for 2 days while we decided what/where to get an ABS (over $1000 from the manufacturer). Told him to hold off on the other work till we get the ABS fixed and he flips out. Told me he ""isn't used to working like this"" thought I was treating him like a clown and told me to never bother him again.

Basically he said that he told me what needed doing and wasn't willing to work with me ever again because I didn't want him to go ahead and do it that same day. Never mind that the repairs might be more than the car is worth. And we have another car that is out and it's repairs might cost us less."

But then they stop, put you back in your prison cell and repeat daily for months on end until one day they do it for real.

"I'm actually in product management, but knowing the basics, learning skills that employers are looking for, being diligent, inquisitive and lucky are all key fundamentals. 

A good graduate scheme can help. There are so many different areas to work in, so think about what interests you - security/UI/mobile/FinTech etc. Then look at technologies and companies in this field to see what they look for/use (e.g stackshare.io). 

Don't neglect soft skills either. Well-rounded tech people are rare and sought after. "
"We're all cut from the same cloth. We all have flaws, insecurities and bad experiences but not one of these things can define us.

Recovery is not a straight path. It often gets worse before it gets better.

I like the plane analogy that comes from Stewart Emerys book Actualisation although I came across it in Susan Jeffers' book. 

When landing a plane there is a console known as the inertial guidance system. The purpose of the system is to get the plane within one thousand yards of the runway for landing the plane. Each time the plane strays off course, the system corrects it. The pilot explained that they would land successfully despite ""having been in error 90 percent of the time."" Emery take it from there, stating: ""So the path from here to where we want to be starts with an error, which is correct, which becomes the next error, which we correct, which becomes the next error and so on"" So the only time we are truly on course is that moment in the zigzag where we cross the true path."""
"I agree that sometimes you give more, sometimes they give more, and that aiming for a perfect and consistent 50/50 split is not going to garner happiness.

But I am curious. My husband and I don't measure the 50/50 as an even half the housework, half the cooking duties, half half the income, etc... We measure it more as, ""You feel like shit this week so I'll do all the housework. When I next feel like shit you will do all the housework."" and ""You worked a 50 hour week and I only worked 38, so I'll handle dinners this week and you don't have to worry about chores when you get home.""

So basically I'm saying we try to have an even distribution of effort, but it's more like the kind of thing that will all work out equal in the long run. Do you think that is unwise and too close to the 50/50 rule?"
"Halloween is a fucking classic. Incredible film. One of the best horror films of all time.

Halloween II isn't as good, but it's a worthy sequel. Kept the atmosphere of the original while expanding the story a bit. Didn't veer off into utter nonsense or anything. I really dug it. 

Halloween III: Season of the Witch. Ok a lot of people hate this, but I actually rather enjoy the movie. The idea was to end they Michael Myers story with Halloween II and then every Halloween movie after that will be a different story taking place on Halloween. If you can think of Halloween III as a standalone  movie and try not to consider it a direct sequel to Halloween II, I think it's a fun 80s horror movie. Tom Atkins is the fucking man. 

But oh, Halloween 4, 5, 6, H2O, and Resurrection. Stop... please just fucking stop. It seemed like with every passing film they just TRIED to make Michael Myers less and less scary. Utter horse shit."
