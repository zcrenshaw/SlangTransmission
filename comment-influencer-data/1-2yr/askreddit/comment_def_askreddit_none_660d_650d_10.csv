no girls def like I when you stalk them across a country and spy on them through their windows.  I saw it in something about mary
"A realistic medieval game where I can work my forge, plant my crops, fish, hunt, etc, or get my gore kick on and join a battle for my country. But there are also no restrictions and I can play as a prince, in command of my own army, so I can take advantage of the Mount And Blade/Medieval 2 Total War style, high def,  open world map."
it really depends on what it is.  I got a degree in audio video and have had all sorts of odd jobs.  def weigh your options
ya I def didn't expect this thread to get so dark
