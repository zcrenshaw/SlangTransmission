You should def post it on her Facebook for the world and her presumed husband to see. 
Getting glasses and seeing the world in high def. Seeing LINES again. Seeing every leaf on every tree.
"Gatdamn, that's interesting! I just spent the last 94 minutes googling the crap out of it and I. AM. FASCINATED. 

TIL the Chinchorro mummies are the earliest examples of purposefully mummified human remains. 

Seems they painted the faces (in addition to other, more gruesome funerary prep...well, gruesome to us anyways) as a way of preventing the bodies (and surviving soul?) from frightening the living. Unclear if this is a literal reanimation deal or what, but the intent strikes me as profoundly considerate. Like, good lookin' out guys. Top notch decency right there, y'all.

And this was like an inherent right. Not some privileged perk reserved for just wealthy or notable elites. This care was granted to errrrrrbody. Peasants, criminals, miscarriages and kings alike (....if they had kings? Haven't yet found any info about the societal structure itself. But the forensics have confidently determined that this was def an egalitarian practice. No matter who you're daddy was, Respek. Straight up.)

Unexpected warm fuzzies from a wtf til, thanks for that."
