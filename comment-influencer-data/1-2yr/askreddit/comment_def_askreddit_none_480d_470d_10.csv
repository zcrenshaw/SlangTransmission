"Man I remember some girls came back to my place with me and my buddies from the pub and we were all plastered as fuck and the first thing I thought was ""Oh shit are my bathrooms clean?!"" So first thing I do is go to my downstairs half bath while everyone was outside smoking and get on my hands and knees to scrub the fuck outta it, then I was like ""Fuck now I'm dirty from cleaning!"" So I went back out and spilled a margarita on myself to have an excuse to say I needed to rinse off real quick while they drank by the firepit, and went upstairs to my full bath and cleaned the fuck outta that. Well I guess one of them had to use the restroom and since I didn't have a roommate at the time I was never locked the door and b/c the downstairs one was apparently being used she came upstairs b/c that's where my buddies told her the other bathroom was and she walked in on me on my knees scrubbing behind the toilet and was like ""Wtf are you doing?"" I had that fuckin deer in the headlights gaze and managed to sputter out ""Well we pregamed here and I didn't want y'all to feel uncomfortable using the bathrooms so I just wanted to clean them up a little bit"" 

Oh man I thought it was fuckin game over at that point and was already berating myself in my head for fucking it up so badly. Cept she just smiled and was like ""We'll it looks like you did a pretty good job, can I use it real quick?"" Just nodded my head yes and walked out and sat on my bed thinking what a dipshit I was. She came back out and was all smiles and was just like ""Well hurry up and clean that margarita off and come downstairs. We're about to do the beer pong teams!"". Me being the naive 20 something I was at the time just nodded dejectedly and hurry up and rinsed off and went back downstairs and my buddy B is waiting for me with this weird look on his face and the first thing he asks me is ""Wtf did you do?"" I figured that she had come downstairs and told her friends and they'd left or something and that I'd ruined the night... 

Nopeeee apparently she had come down and told them and they'd shared a good laugh about it but apparently after that my buddy B had told them that since they were the guests they'd get to pick their pong partners and then 3 of them had started arguing and had a rock scissors paper game to decide which would get to play with me lol. My buddies def teased me about that for a bit, like ""You know they're just fighting over who gets to take you home to clean their house first right? You're gonna be their free Mexican cleaning service!"" 

Ended up dating the girl for awhile and one time I asked her something along the lines of ""Why weren't you scared off when you saw me cleaning the bathrooms, it was kinda a dork move on my part to be honest"" and she just looked at me and said ""Well I took the chance that if you took the time to do something like that for someone you just met, that you weren't  a complete knob and I wanted to see if that carried over to how you treat your friends/gf."" 

Sorry for the mile long rant, just gave me a flashback to a good memory thank you for that!"
"Couple years ago i worked at a Deli inside a Walmart Neighborhood Market (aka just groceries) Every three hours we had to mark rotisserie chickens and other foods on the hot plates down 50% 
If people were kind or looked they could ""use some help"" i would mark the down almost anytime. I couldn't tell you how many folks came in who i would give a few extra slices of cheese or ham to for free and just their faces light up. They def. needed it more then Wal-Mart.."
"Ah yes, i went to a guy's bathroom and in it were tampons, makeup and her red thong in the laundry basket... Def had a GF. "
"Wow this is too similar to my wedding lmaoooo. Husbands best friends mom WAS invited, her daughter on the other hand was not as (same as you) it was NOT kid friendly wedding and I had made this explicitly clear. She also never rsvped. The entire night she ran around with her Nikon coolpix and tried to out-photograph my paid photographer. The daughter also would not leave us alone the entire night, wanting to show us dance moves and just being generally annoying. 

Yours def turned out worse and Iâ€™m glad your mum stood up for you! "
