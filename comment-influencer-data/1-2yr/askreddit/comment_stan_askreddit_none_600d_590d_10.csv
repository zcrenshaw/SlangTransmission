"Spoiler Ahead

As an adult, I was a little disappointed in the ending.  I understand it's a kids show, and that Stan getting his memory back was inevitable considering the target audience, but I feel like his sacrifice would have had a lot more weight if he hadn't gotten it back.   Or at least if they had held off a littler longer before giving it back.  I feel like the scene when they get on the bus would have been perfect: Stan is memory-less and the twins are sad, then Stan says something that indicates he remembers Waddles.  Insert the exact same scrap-book-memories scene right there at the bus stop, and its perfect.  It leads you on a lot longer thinking he really lost his memory forever, but still eventually gives the closure of it returning. "
