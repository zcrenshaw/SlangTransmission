"Oh my fam's closet is a walk-in at this point and it is full skeletons. I'll share my top two.

1. When I was a sophomore in college, my step-sisters and I found out that my stepdad/ their dad was (and sadly, still is) an active high-functioning crack user. The craziest thing is that we had quite a bit of money at one-point. My stepdad sold his tech business when I was in high school and my family made about 1.5 million dollars. We packed up, moved to a tropical place, bought a house on an island - a yacht - a new car - two kayaks (that nobody every used) - and a bunch of ""new money"" bullshit. Our parents invested nothing - nothing in our education or future (yay student loans). My stepdad stopped working at this point and disappeared for long ""work trips"" despite not working, my mom started drinking heavily, we all find out my stepdad has a crack mistress, and they get divorced. I'm a freshman in college at this point and shit starts to really unravel. They sell everything off in the divorce and split the remaining money down the middle - about 500k each. My stepdad spends through it in 6 months... 6 months. His $40k car ends up on the news - he let his druggy friends borrow it, and they rob a gas station, get in a huge car chase and crash it. Oh but he lapsed on the insurance, so buh-buh car. Long story short, he might live in CA now - think he married his mistress - def a hardcore drug addict. Really, though, it explained so much of his behavior over the years. 

Really - it makes perfect sense when I share the second story.

2. This story is about my stepfather's great-grandmother - Let's call her Baba. When Baba was in her 20's she was living with her husband and spinster sister. Baba couldn't have kids. Baba's husband has an affair with her spinster sister and her sister gets pregnant. 9 months later, the spinster sister has the baby in the house and Baba - who obviously at this point knows about the affair - takes the baby and throws it into the fire. Really have no idea how the family line continued but it did - probably through more affair babies.

Really the whole thing clicks together when you consider THAT story. Family secrets = jealousy = infant murder = lying about lineage = not knowing how to handle things or talk to one another = angry teenage stepdad = bad crowd = life long crack addiction = short lived success = more crack addiction. "
"for sure I think it def depends on how your life pans out, but if you put in hard work in and it pays off, being a grown up can be pretty fun"
"I suppose I could riff a list of things that I care as little about as our last week together. Lemme see, uhh... Low-carb diets. Michael Moore. The Republican National Convention. Kabbalah and all Kabbalah-related products. Hi-def TV, the Bush daughters, wireless hot spots, 'The O.C.', the U.N., recycling, getting Punk'd, Danny Gans, the Latin Grammys, the real Grammys. Jeff, that Wiggle who sleeps too darn much! The Yankees payroll, all the red states, all the blue states, every hybrid car, every talk show host! Everything on the planet, everything in the solar system, everything everything everything everything everything everything - eve - everything that exists - past, present and future, in all discovered and undiscovered dimensions.

Oh! And Hugh Jackman."
