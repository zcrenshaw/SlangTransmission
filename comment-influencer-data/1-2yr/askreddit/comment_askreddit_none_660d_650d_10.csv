"If he actually deserved the fine, its not professionalism, its bad police work. And if he didnt deserve it the cop missused his position as a cop.

However this is, the cop fucked up, and if he fixed it, thats a good thing, but he still fucked up at the start, and should be reprimanded for it, not rewarded."

"I don't like Queen and I'm not interested in this song which just sound pretty DUMB ! I mean come on, I saw a music programme this afternoon on TV where they showed us throwback of greatest hits of 80s-90s etc. And they showed that famous video with the 4 faces of Queen members, in the dark, with all the hairs, the way Freddie Mercury says all those deconstructed words ""mama mia ! BISMILALALALA"" and then suddnely ""galileo figaro scaramouche"" 


Are you serious ? What the fuck is wrong with that song it sounds SO FUCKING DUMB and un-musical, un-poetic at all ! Unpleasant. "

The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow

And, yikes:

This sounds like the whole continent of Africa is this desert wasteland full of these little starving children who don't know happiness and won't you, civilized Western person, save them? Like, the song's heart is in the right place, but..."

"So is this an argument for a universal income? Otherwise, I don't see a solution. You are either employed or not employed. Why should an employee not be able to let go of people? I've been let go before and it sucks, but that's part of life. Why should we restrict companies by passing some legislation that gives way more power to the worker in the wrong area? I want better benefits and pay, but I don't want my employer to be stuck with shitty workers. 

Have you ever worked with someone who made things worse? They were bad at their job and you hated coming in everyday and seeing them? At will is one way to get rid of those people. Even then, it doesn't happen overnight,. Companies follow a process for bad employees before they just dump them. Put them on an improvement plan, give multiple warnings, etc. This is a way to cover their ass in case the person feels wronged once they are finally fired.

Where have you been for the last 8 years? Obamacare made it impossible for employers to afford to hire full time workers.
"I didn't say everything.  Yeah its totally the corporations fault that some girl decided to fuck some loser and give birth to his bastard child while completely unprepared financially to raise that child.  ~5/10 white kids grow up without a father in the home, ~7/10 black kids grow up without a father in the home.  Yes all these kids disadvantaged, growing up in single parent homes.  Its all the corporations fault, none of their disadvantages were due to the decisions of their parents.  "

"Ahh, shaming.

Why is it that when someone points out some shitty behaviors and attitudes of women, you, or others must shame, or deny those truths?  Women aren't goddesses, they are merely human with human flaws.


What is the point of trying to stifle discussions of shitty women?  What is gained?"

You don't want it to be true. Reality has a liberal bias my friend.
Of course reddit is the place for neckbeards to insult chads and stacies. Get a fucking life!  Even if we don't have any personalities we're still hot as fuck. Not to mention some of us are geniuses with high IQs.

Years ago I met a girl online who did LARPing. She was only about an hour away from where I lived and we became friends. So one weekend a friend and I drive an hour to met her and her friends.

"Because it takes a much less refined skill set to serve chicken wings than it does to serve in fine dining (and many gradiations in between).

Percentage tips create incentive to sell more and to bust your ass when it is very busy. It is difficult for people who have never been in the industry to understand that there is a lot more going on than just what you see, which is your server bringing you food. And some very professional servers can be utterly swamped and on the verge of a panicked meltdown and you would never know it to watch them work. Serving large numbers of people is high stress and more difficult than it looks.

It's definitely not an ideal system, but bars and restaurants tank more than they succeed and labor cost can make or break their profit margins. 

Among the many downsides is the instability of the servers' income. Even with such low labor costs, management will cut staff based on volume, so it's not all that unusual for a server to come in and spend a couple hours setting up before simply being cut and going home sometimes completely empty handed.

I'll stop rambling, but essentially, serving people is hard work and no one would do it for minimum wage. I'm all for paying a fair wage, but you will be paying the wage either way through higher menu prices, with the cost of more bars and restaurants failing and reducing the incentives on the part of the wait staff.

As a socialist, I kind of hate myself for defending any aspect of capitalism, but I think going to a standard wage system in food service would be detrimental in the short term, at least."
"I think that a lot of people who don't really tip would stop going to restaurants because they would be forced to pay the regular cost plus the average tip, and that would make restaurants much more expensive for them. The higher tippers wouldn't make up for this loss by coming more."

Sure they *looked* the same and the names were the same but they didn't talk or act like the characters from Farscape, so it essentially killed two shows I liked all at once. "

"Firstly... way to word your question like a douche. You're being incredibly insensitive. If they truly think that vaccine caused this life altering mental state in their CHILD, why would they get them more? Think about the logic there. That's like saying, oh well a car seat didn't save your kid from being paralyzed, why would you still use one?

Secondly, a lot of people who aren't anti-vaxxers don't do flu shots. My kids have all their vaccines, but we never do the flu shot -my sisters get the shot every year, and they get the flu every year. Without fail. Me, my kids, and my S.O. have never gotten the flu shot, and we've never gotten the flu.

Vaccines and the flu shot are different animals. Lumping them together to accuse people of being stupid ruins your argument."

Nope.  They aren't.  
  
&gt;It's not that much of a shitty job if you're good at it. There's a lot of parents just really wanting their child to do at least something with their lives, and willing to pay you to help their child find something they won't instantly reject.
  
Nope, this isn't a field that even marginally exists.  It seems like something you just sort of assume to be true because there are cab drivers and formula 1 drivers and crop duster pilots and fighter pilots, but there is no 'well paid private career counselor for wealthy 17 year olds'
  
That's not a thing.

"...not underachieve?

If you were trying to set yourself apart from the crowd, you should have gone with a different comment "
"It's a mixed bag. Pride is a huge freaking factor in reporting, and there's a lot of pride in the military. Depends on your exact location but the Air Force treated my mental illness exactly like they would a physical illness. Very professionally but with some duty limitations. It's the same way you would treat a physical illness. If you had a chronic injury, you really shouldn't remain on flying status/duty/whatever career path that might be effected by it. But that doesn't stop people from hiding injuries. Losing that status can be a serious career/pride blow. It's not an easy issue to tackle, but in terms of mental health treatment I'd have to say the military is on the forefront. 

As for the encourage honesty and then punish for it? It feels like punishment sure, but that's trying to take care of you and everyone else also risking their lives. Military service seriously does eat you up and spit you out. But they can't really avoid eating you up, so they at least want to spit you out with the best care and benefits they can. Having a serious injury just shifts you from getting eaten up to the getting spit out route.  "
Its not
Da fuq you talking about? Your use of the word reads like a sick pun. I'm not the one making a joke.
"Well, yeah. A billion is a million times 1,000, and 11.5 days x 1,000 makes 11,500 days. Divide that by 365, and you get just over 31.5, which rounds up to 32. That's not exactly mind-blowing."
