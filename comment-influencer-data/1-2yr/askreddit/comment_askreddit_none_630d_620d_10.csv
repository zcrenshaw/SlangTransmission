"No. Nice strawmanin'!

There are already harassment laws and stalking laws and assault laws. No need for a weaker version.

Actually the whole thing took off around here when this woman killed herself. 

People had already broken several existing laws on this woman and then bring up all these antubullying tripe. No bringing up that we could try respecting and understanding the laws we already fucking have. 

She was far worse than bullied. The scope of bullying is quite vast as well. You can prank your buddy and it could be taken as bullying. Well could be assault too, if your prank game is on par.

Nope just don't bully. Silly. 


Nanny state rubbish. 

How about DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE!

Same here. It's just annoying now. I go into a random store or whatever and have to listen to Christmas songs the day after Halloween it seems like. Fuck that. I hate the obnoxious lights. The annoying Christmas music commercials. Stores full of people gift shopping. Sucks that I have to spend some nice days off running around on a schedule to see both my and my wife's families. It's a nightmare to me. If I could opt out of Christmas forever I would.

There’s thousands of scholarships out there now a days and they’re really not that hard to find. Most people are just too lazy to apply for them. I got a scholarship last year and only 3 people had applied. 3 people. I fully believe a lot of people just aren’t putting the effort into finding this practically free money and are just complaining instead. "

"When you go from reporting to advocating for specific policy positions without taking your scientist/expert hat off in between. Facts are objective, what but society should do to respond to those facts is a subjective question subject to ideology. That an expert is qualified and skilled enough to determine the facts doesn't give them any extra authority to tell use what the right thing to do is. But many experts don't respect that distinction, and start acting like they know what is best for society.

Lets take oil exploration in the arctic. The biologist who has spent their career studying the arctic eco system and anthropogenic impacts to it is uniquely qualified to predict what the impact of oil exploration will be. But whether avoiding that impact is worth the loss of that oil is a judgement call, and they don't have any special authority to tell us how we should decide on it, as long as we respect the facts on the impacts that they and other scientists provide to inform the decision."

"I used the wrong word, yes. But I am not fully wrong, a lot of the people who are unaffiliated do identify with a god, but don't practice.

In fact, despite Christians forming 70% of the US population, and unaffiliated's 16%, 31% of Americans say they are non-religious, and 29% say they are somewhat Religious. And only 37% of Americans attend church regularly. These stats obviously don't line up, proving my point that many people believe in God, they just don't commit to religion. Going by that, i'd say outside of using the wrong word, I am not wrong."

"How trashy, lazy, inconsiderate, and whorish they are"
"Having lived in those places I am fully aware of how to convert the figures and what they would buy you and I maintain $20 USD an hour is fairly average for those positions for most countries.

Exchange rates don't tell a full picture as you would need to convert the entire cost of living to USD to get a true comparison. Then you would have to look at other factor, healthcare, benefits, etc. You also can't assume that Napier and Auckland have the same cost of living, Narrawallee and Sydney, or London and Bradford. The wages would not be the same either. That is an average of wages across entire countries, of course places with higher costs of living have higher wages. Just like how the [US average waitstaff wage](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/waiter-and-waitress/salary) of $11 does not show the full facts.

I'm sorry to tell you but you're conversions aren't accurate, because they don't meet the [minimum wages](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-31/minimum-wage-how-does-australia-compare/7461794) by quite a long way. That link is a little old, but is still a useful comparison. The minimum wage has gone up in [Australia](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/how-we-will-help/templates-and-guides/fact-sheets/minimum-workplace-entitlements/minimum-wages), the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates) and [NZ](https://ww[w.business.govt.nz/hiring-and-managing/hiring-people/minimum-pay-rules/) since then. The [US federal rate](https://paywizard.org/main/salary/minimum-wage) but will [rise soon](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/minimum-wage-increase-states-in-2018-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T), however, as the article points out, it varies by state in the US and that can make it more difficult to compare. Then, of course, you would need to factor in bonus pay. In Australia for example, you earn [casual loading plus penalty rates](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/news-and-media-releases/newsletter/august-2014/understanding-casual-penalty-rates) so your take home pay is usually far higher than the minimum wage.

I maintain that you had a good point about the owners of restaurants not having to pay staff out of their pockets, I'm sure many businesses would love to get away with a model like this. It is interesting to see how it varies from place to place.

I also appreciate you reading my links, a lot of people don't show that courtesy, so thanks for being so kind :)

edit: added the US minimum wage links"

"Unless you're deliberately seeking out a certain narrative, that's not correct. Especially in academic discussions, I think you're interpretting them wrong.

"Definitely the unwritten code that men run up against. It's why if you have any experience on tinder and other online dating sites, you know that women eek out the weakest initiations giving a ""hi"" or ""hey"" in the vast majority of cases. Go look at r/tinder to see how men are expected to be ""witty"" and have good pick up lines etc.

But this is also the greatest opportunity given to guys if you frame it with the right mindset. It's the chance to practice developing charisma and initiating conversions, refining where you go wrong and what you do right. You can spin it as burden or take it as a time to give yourself to the best of your abilities. Obviously this takes some time and requires effort: Get a new haircut, hit the gym, start new hobbies and do whatever it takes to get a partner/laid (which by the way, is not superficial, it's just playing the mating game - I think of it the equivalent of girl's feeling the need to put on make up)

At its core, this is a social skill that men must develop. Don't spin rejection so negatively. Take advantage of it and you may be surprised with the results you get."
