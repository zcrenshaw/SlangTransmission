"Yeah, I agree with the logic, I disagree when taking into account people who are addicted to food like my fat ass. Super easy not to eat? Sure, until you realize that you have just finished off the bag of crackers that you were going to just have 3 of.  I did get myself to lose the weight and eat and exercise continually. Got in super good shape, 3 years later right back where I started. Some of us drink too much, some of us do too many drugs, some of us eat the entire pot of soup compulsively. I'm not making excuses, there's a super simple solution to my weight problem, i just wouldn't call it easy. "
"The problem isn't with guns, the problem is with American society encouraging violence across the poorest sectors of its people. Our internal socioeconomic policy services to create a nearly inescapable cycle of crime and violence once you're in the system.

That bad people can get guns is a problem, but bad people can get knives and baseball bats and swords and shit too, so let's focus on preventing the causes of violence before we start punishing law abiding citizens for the crimes of others."

"Literally just worked at a concert for a pretty famous punk band. I usually work in production, but this venue I occasionally work events at an hour away has us out of towners also work security during the event so we can maximize the time we're there and make more money.

I'm having to work a side door right next to the merch tables. Some guy comes up and starts demanding that he be cut a good deal on merch he was wanting to buy, and is saying really crude shit to our local guy who was helping the touring merch person run his tables. Tells him ""fuck you"" for not cutting him a deal, and then he proceeds to spill his entire beer on a piece of display merch that was priced at about $40. He refuses to pay for it, and then takes off the shirt he was about to buy that he had just put on his sweaty body before he would hand over any money for it. He tossed the shirt back at the display racks on the wall, told the merch guys ""fuck this, and fuck you"" and makes his girlfriend give back the bandana he was about to probably buy her too, and then tells her he's going to give the lead singer a call when they're done playing. The likelihood of this guy knowing the singer was slim to none, honestly.

I go over and ask them if they want the guy thrown out for damaging multiple pieces of their merchandise without paying for it, and we all agree it needed to happen. We get 3 or 4 guys over to him, since he was being belligerent we expected him to be physically violent as well. Walk him out the door, he starts demanding he speaks to the manager of the venue, which we don't let him do. We tell the venue manager what happened and he just says, ""fuck him, he stays out"". And that was that."

This was a few years back but I remember it perfectly.

Since he was ""smurfing"" he thought of himself as higher up than everyone else even though he was a few ranks higher. The score was 14-15 and our team had the chance to tie, guess who were the ones last alive on our team? Me and the shit talker. I followed him to a bomb site, looked him right in his pixelated fucking face, and shot my nova right at him as my teammates were hollering laughing. Then I t-bagged him for the entire minute left of the round. The entire minute. I spammed my crouch button for a fucking minute. On his face. Fuck you.

"A girl from my school is now Instagram-famous, she got some lip injections and dyed her hair, started plugging those weight loss teas and getting her own discount codes for trendy women's clothes shops, the lot. However the whole way through school she used to pretend she was a baby. Like, an actual baby. She'd get really offended if someone didn't play along and used to throw tantrums and have a dummy (pacifier) in her pocket that she'd suck on, and pretend her 'mummy' needed to change her every now and again whenever she needed the bathroom during class. This phase spanned pretty much the whole of our secondary school time, so about age 11-16. Oh, and every now and again she'd get bored of being a baby and become a cat, then get bored of being a cat and become a baby again. 

No matter how good she thinks she looks now, I'll still remember her as the girl who pretended to shit her pants during art class. "
"Late to the party, but whatever: My grandfather was captured by the British in late 1944. He spent the next 1.5 years as a POW in England. He never really talked about what they did to him, but he loved to talk about having a pet fox in his cell. He traded some of his rationed cigarettes with the guards for some extra food for the fox. He told me that the fox was the only thing that kept him sane."
"When we were at school we were doing ‘stories with morals’. This kid got up and told us his great grandfather was in WW1, in the trenches. Apparently things were looking grim after waves of German attacks, and ammo was getting low. He was down to six bullets. So he stuck on his bayonet and pulled out a bottle of whisky and started sipping, all while artillery pounded his position. He kept sipping away, knowing this probably the end, and he drank until the bottle was empty. Then the artillery stopped, the whistles blew and the rifles started up as they leapt over the trenches and charged forward. Great grandpa ran along, shot six Germans, and when his ammo was gone he bayoneted another and smashed the face of another using his rifle butt. After the battle he got a medal for bravery. The class was all quiet and the teacher finally said ‘that’s an impressive story – what’s the moral?’ And the kid said ‘Don’t fuck with great grandpa when he’s on the hard stuff’"

"I agree. I'm tired of superhero movies these days just focusing on world building, instead of making a cool movie. If you go back and watch the original Donner Superman films, or the Burton Batman films, they weren't trying to lay the frame for another decade of easy cash. They were trying to tell a compelling story. 

2008 was an odd year for SH movies, in my opinion. We got TDK, which is viewed by many (including myself) as the best SH movie. TDK didn't try and create a whole universe of money, it focused solely on Batman stopping the Joker. Also in '08, we got Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, which began the whole cash-grab MCU bullshit that we have to deal with nowadays. "

So basically, I'm gay...like *really gay.*  Not feminine, but I *love* men and have since I was a tiny little thing. (I'm 40 now, but knew I was gay at puberty and never had one ounce of attraction to women.)  I have never, ever had a romantic feeling towards a woman or had a physical reaction looking at them.  Not once and I'm not joking.  I'm not grossed out or anything, but they do nothing for me.    

Looking at boobs is like looking at an elbow for me...women's bodies just aren't visually stimulating for me.  But men? Yeah. I love everything about them: The walk, the talk, the look, the feel, the voice, the way they smell...everything.

When I was 16, I met a girl in drama class. (Of *course* lol!)  She was falling hard for me and I had to tell her I was gay.  This was about 1993 or so.  She said ""Eh whatever"" and we became good friends.  But she clearly was in love with me in the way that a 17 year old girl can fall for a 16 year old boy.  

So what happened was she just kept pursuing it.  Not in a ""I'll make you straight"" kind of way, but in a ""Hey, I know you are gay but let me touch you and you don't have to do anything back"" kind of way.  Back rubs in her room became chest rubs which became hand jobs which became blowjobs which became sex.  

When you are 16 and horny and a girl says ""I'll give you great blowjobs and you don't have to reciprocate"" *and* you really care for the girl as a close friend, things can move into heavier territory quickly. We ended up having a relationship that lasted almost 3 years, and we had wonderful, intimate, caring unprotected sex during that time.  Looking at her body didn't do anything, but DAMN the glove like fit of being inside her was amazing. (I actually lament the fact that I haven't done that since I was 19.  LAst time was with her and there is no reason for it to ever happen again.)  

For my gay brothers who have never been condomless inside a woman...wow.  I'm telling you, it feels better than any other pace to put your willy.  Not joking there either! 

Anyway, that relationship ran its course and we ended up staying friends and in close contact.  I took the pictures at her wedding and her husband knows all about me and 25 years or so later, I am still friends with her. :)  

So anyway, that's my story of being a married gay father who loves the feeling of his penis in a vagina! Haha!   "

Getting drunk feels like you are putting your brain on idle. Only the basic functions are allowed to be working. You laugh at simple things. Your standards for food and entertainment relax, it's like being a kid again. 

No over thinking. No creeping thoughts of doubt or worry. You are giving all of that  a time-out. 

Now, it's not healthy to need alcohol to do all that for you. People get addicted because they rely on alcohol to wind down too often. 

It's alright every once in a while, with friends or family you don't see often. But learning to calm your brain (meditation helps me) and  finding  a hobby that gives you confidence  is key.

Logical person:  You don't eat leftovers.

Illogical person: But you do.

Logical person:   You can still eat it.

Illogical person:  But I don't like leftovers, why don't you eat it.

"Ok so this is going to sound real weird... but here it goes.

In 2005 at BeachBreak, Camp Darby Italy. On a club beyond youth trip my male councilor told me something I would never forget.

He said ""PHOTON_BANDIT, would you like to know the most liberating, carnal, and best feel good thing you can ever experience is?""

Of course I said yes.

""Have you ever eaten a orange in the shower?""

""no... no i havent""

""Well just think about it PHOTON_BANDIT. Tearing apart a cold fresh orange with your bare hands, just letting the juices run over your body. Not worrying if your going to get sticky, or anything. Just ripping it in half, and tearing into it with your teeth like a savage cannibal who hasnt eaten in a week! Yes PHOTON_BANDIT, this is the most carnal, ferocious, liberating thing a man can do""

And from that day forward, I start my mornings with an orange in the shower.

"I read a book about Washington once which tried to point out his flaws:

* When he was first named general of the Continental Army, he didn't know that much about strategy, and lost a few battles.  Which... okay, he learned.

* He consciously arranged his life so he'd be remembered well.  Which... considering how he chose to do it, I can't fault him at all."
"Thirty years ago a friend in Chicago asked if I believed in ghosts. I said I didnt as I had never seen one. He said he does because of an incident. Years earlier he saw one of his childhood friends walking down the street toward him. This friend had been reported missing. Even though he was quite a long way off, he could recognize his walk. Then he disappeared (or something, I dont remember what happened.) Turns out, the friend was found under the floor boards of John Wayne Gacy's house.   "

 He got angry at me because the dealership I worked at had to adjust his seat when his car was in for a recall. He couldn't get it back to where he liked it and screamed at me about how it was my fault. The irony of it was he is also a technician and would bitch about customers that act the way he was acting. It took me a week to end things from that night but that night was my wake up call.
He was my longest relationship (2 years) and first guy I lived with yet it was the easiest one to leave. I have yet to cry and it's been 2 months now. I think the falling out of love was gradual I didn't notice it at first, until that night. "

"The first place he worked at, he was a field employee that doesn't work in a traditional office.        
So his hours and schedule were fairly flexible.   Not to mention that company at the time had something like 150,000 employees.

The second job, where I met him, was fairly relaxed about your hours too.     

The things that all made sense after I found out:      
He would go missing for hours at a time, and then later claim to be in the DataCenter, Cafeteria, company Gym, etc.         
He had a brand new corporate model laptop that was not standard issue where we worked together.  He claimed a friend got it for him.   Found out later when I left, it was the standard model at the other company.         
He was also very secretive.  So if you came over to his desk to talk to him about something, he often was quickly closing/minimizing stuff he had open.            
And I always felt he wasn't really pulling his weight.

The irony of a time where he said his wife didn't work and he was struggling to keep up with her relaxed spending habits all made sense later."

Look, you didn't ask for advice but I'll give it- if you truly know the relationship isn't working and there's nothing tying you to it (kids, joint property), bite the bullet and end it.

Later his gf laughs at a joke the guy makes and she is the only one that laughs. He keeps replaying these scenes after the party has ended and he goes crazy thinking she cheats.

"When I was little, my best friend's mom had cancer. I never knew her healthy. My best friend was an only child, so I essentially was the second kid. I went everywhere and did everything with them. 

One day, my friend wasn't at school and I knew her mom was really sick. My parents had prepared me for this day. I came home and my dad told me my best friend's mom had died. I was maybe 8. This woman was important to me and my second mother. I went to my room and remember crying, screaming, and throwing things out of anger, sadness, and uncertainty. 

Things get foggy for me now, but my mom said five minutes later I came out of my room all smiles and told her the lady that died came to me, sat on my bed, and told me she was me and my best friend's guardian angel. I never shed another tear. I am not an overly spiritual person, but I sincerely believe this woman did this for me, as it is what it needed most.

Hi Peter.
"I think I've posted this before but it is worth sharing again.

I was asked to do a technical interview of a candidate for a senior level position. I got his resume and it was very long but he had good experience. I am a serial Googler though. I Google everything I can find on most people. Within the first few searches I did I got hits on government websites. Even more it was for a federal case the candidate was involved in.

I look into the case and find out that our candidate was the defendant in a federal trial for selling contracts at his prior employer or something to that effect. I did cross references to be sure it was him. Then I find out that the result was a 1 or 1.5  year prison sentence in a federal prison. Looking back at his resume, he was conveniently self-employed for that time. He had to have been released not more than a month or two prior.

Now, at the time I worked for a large Fortune 100 company and to get to me this guy would have already had to pass through our recruiting system and a recruiter. I informed the hiring manager that he was convicted of this crime and asked if he knew. He didn't and was very upset. I told him that we needed to interview him anyway because if he passed the bar of the recruiting process then we shouldn't make that part of our decision process.

The guy interviewed really well. I recommend him for a hire and the hiring manager was impressed too and made him an offer. He rejected it to accept an offer from another company. I was a little shocked to find out that a man who was just released from prison turned us down because he had too many offers. "

"This was why I had to get out of a lot of feminist/left-wing internet communities. I still believe in a lot of the principles, but it just wasn't worth the damage it was doing to me mentally to stay in those communities. I was constantly walking on eggshells and afraid. I was paranoid that I'd say the wrong thing and get dogpiled and humiliated. I was even afraid to say that I thought that attacks on a person who had said something ""problematic"" were out of line, because they'd come for me too. I just wanted to find more like-minded people who were interested in politics and advocacy for a more just, fair world, and instead I found nothing but toxicity. 

Honestly, I found the world of foreign policy/international relations much more welcoming; when I volunteered with a foreign policy think tank, I'd see my boss (who's basically very slightly to the right of Marx) happily drinking with a guy who would probably tongue-kiss Margaret Thatcher's corpse given the chance, and even though they disagreed wholeheartedly, they were happy to hear different perspectives and find common ground on policy issues. And a lot of demonization of the US/US foreign policy/all of that had an element of ribbing (you Americans always cocking everything up), not genuine hatred. I felt so much more at ease, and I learned a whole lot more. "

"Not a teacher but happened while I was at work. I work part time for a party service so we essentially only go to childrens birthday parties. The kids were in the 11-15 range. A group of them was playing Minecraft and one kid, who looked to be about 13-14, screamed ""Haha, I named my guy poop!"" (he had made a new xbox avatar). Then, during their voxel based adventures, he kept asking his friends to help him build a poop statue, write the words poop and butthole in the ground etc. He had this weird obsession with all things poop and poop related. It wouldn't be that bad if he was 8, but the kid couldn't have been younger than 13 tops. I just kind of cringed internally for a second then went back to browsing reddit. To be fair, he seemed like he was a bit on the spectrum, but it was still cringy to say the least."

"Not me but a friend who is a pilot.

She stayed at an older hotel downtown Chicago and was studying for her recurrent class which was in a few weeks. While at the desk, deep in thought, she heard people talking and laughing. When she looked up, it got quiet. She said it sounded like it was in the room with her and went back to studying. The noise started off softly and then again sounded like a party was going on in her room. She got up and looked around and there was silence. There were no sounds coming from any rooms, no televisions on, no radios, no people in the hallway - the noise was definitely in her room.  That night around 2 am, she was in bed and felt someone brush strands of hair from her forehead and tuck it behind her ear. She jumped up and turned on the light and there was no one there. She didn't get back to sleep and bid around that overnight so she wouldn't be in that hotel again.

Then if they say to get rid of the dogs you say ""okay, how about get rid of half of &lt;race/ethnicity&gt;, or all of the dogs"". Just to see how far they'd go.

"A friend of mine and his late wife adopted a young girl 8-9, she had the usual sad background of coming from abusive situation. She loved her adopted mother, but had issues with her adopted dad(my friend). One day the girl walks into the room he's in, pulls down her pants and starts screaming, and started accusing him of touching her. Luckily his wife was in the other room and came running in and saw it, his wife also knew her background and that she has acted out like that before. 

If his wife hadn't been there she probably would have gotten away with it and he'd have been arrested. The girl had to be moved to a new house for a while after that, last time I saw them all everything seemed to be more normalized.

I agree with that in a sense but then you got cases where a father kills the guy who is responsible for his son's death or the guy who molested his son. Despite that being murder they usually get incredibly light sentences or no sentence at all and get off with parole. It doesn't seem fair to give light sentences for some cases like this but not other similar cases if you understand what I'm getting at.

Basically I was homeless, jobless and carless, my mom refused to let me stay in her 5 bedroom 5700sq ft home (she lives alone) because in her words I was a disgrace to the family due to my getting divorced. Instead she handed me a list of shelters. So after spending a few days couch surfing a kind friend let me borrow a car and that was me and my 3 yr old house for a while.

"When I was about 12, my church went camping at a pretty large campground. It was an annual thing, and it lasted about a week. That year, we went to a place with showers and bathrooms.
The first night, Monday, after eating camp food, I went to check pi t the toilets to drop off some major turdage. To my horror, I found that the toilets were lined up against the wall, no dividers, walls, or privacy of any kind. Fuck that, I'll hold it.
I made the decision to hold it every day (multiple times a day), but on Saturday morning, I knew it was going to happen, and the only part i had in the decision was where it happened. At least it was early, no one was up. I ran to the toilet, and unleashed the most horrid shit that I, or anyone else will ever see. Finally, sweet relief.
I looked over to grab some TP, but wait. NO! The roll was empty! I looked to my left. Empty rolls across the lines of toilets. Not even a cardboard tube!
I realized I had two options:
A. Sacrifice the underwear to the gods of necessity
B. Waddle to the sink and use that as some sort of Bidet (the showers were in another building)
Age and experience would now lead me to choose option A., but at the time, B. was chosen. I waddled over, backed up the faucet, and cleansed my arse in the tepid camp water.
Then all of a sudden, I see the door open. One of the elders in the church walked in, and stopped, looking dead in my eyes. Centuries passed as water ran through my crack and we stared into each other's eyes. Then, he abruptly turned around and walked out of the door.

"Hitchcock peaked in the 50s with a string of movies that are among some of the best thrillers ever made -

Strangers on a Train - 1951

Dial M for Murder - 1954

Rear Window - 1954

To Catch a Thief - 1955

The Man Who Knew Too Much - 1956

The Wrong Man - 1956

Vertigo - 1958

North by Northwest - 1959

Psycho - 1960

My favorite is Rear Window, in which a bored man recovering from a bad accident starts watching his neighbors across the courtyard, and realizes that one is a murderer. The story is built very carefully, and every line of dialogue and every shot matters. It may be a perfect movie. It also features Grace Kelly at her peak, and in this movie she may have been the most beautiful woman to every appear on screen. 

However, as much as I love that one, a great case could be made about any of them. If you watch them once, you'll want to watch them over and over. They never get boring."

"At my primary school (age 4 to 11), you had to have two pairs of shoes: outdoor shoes and indoor shoes. You arrived at school in your outdoor shoes (black) and changed into your indoor shoes (brown) in the hallway before you went into the classroom. When the bell went for playtime, you changed into your outdoor shoes before you went outside. When you came back in 15 minutes later, you changed back into your indoor shoes. Same at lunchtime, same at afternoon playtime, and then at home time you changed into your outdoor shoes and went home.

We got in SO MUCH trouble if we were outside in our indoor shoes. To this day (I'm 34 now) I don't understand what that was about."
"I was a virgin. After making out, she got in doggy style position and told me to ""fuck her."" I was totally blind sided and too nervous to get an erection."
"My big loss was before MyFitnessPal, which it seems we can all agree is fantastic. I used a sort of similar thing, a PS2 ""game"" called Yourself Fitness. It was basically a personal trainer and food guide. It had you do some measurements, establish your fitness level, and then helped create a workout and diet schedule for you. Making a game of it appealed to me, seeing it in terms of multiple small goals, or looking at improving my body as a series of sidequests and leveling up. 

There's no tricks to it. Just establish your daily calorie needs and eat at or below that number. Exercise certainly helps. For me, cutting out sodas took 500+ calories out of my day."

"&gt; The church has absolutely nothing to gain by letting polygamy fly on the down low.

Absolutely it does!  The church was ended by the Supreme court in 1890 over polygamy when all of its assets were seized:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Corp._of_the_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-Day_Saints_v._United_States

The church then continued to violate the promise it made not to practice polygamy in both the U.S. and Mexico until 1905 when Apostle Mathew Crowley lost his place on the Quorum of the 12 when he, a 65 year old, married a 19 year old in secret.

This led to a witch hunt to find which apostle was still sealing polygamist marriages in secret in the ward of Harold B. Lee, who would become pivotal in the formation of the current church.  

This witch hunt pushed people who still believed that they were under commandment to continue plural marriage to splinter off, led by Loren Wooley; who was first cousin to Joseph F. Smith. 

The church shifted it's Marketing to say that Polygamy had ended 100 years before; when really the church had polygamous members well in the 1960's, 1964 being the last one I can find find alive. 

My Mother was proposed to, to be a man's 5th wife in 1959 by someone who knew this secret order was still in place; and she turned him in.  He was excommunicated by the ""We never practiced polygamy"" believing side that followed Harold B. Lee's Correlation committee.  A committee who's job it was to control the message, and who altered all the manuals to remove references to polygamy.

I know you want ""more for a source than a dude who owns a computer and a microphone."" and I can give sources on each, But Year of Polygamy is interviews of people who wrote books on the subject that have been published.  Historians, people who lived in the polygamous areas, expert historians.

I am featured on two of the podcasts.  My Grandfather grew up in Polygamist Mexico.  

Just because it is a podcast doesn't mean it's made up or poor history.  Lindsay Hansen Park (not a dude) put a ton of effort into the historicity of the podcast and it's worth a listen.  I would even say it is THE premier source on the subject where she corrects previous things mentioned if the data doesn't shake out; or gives both perspectives from multiple historians.

It's hardly ""Some dude with a computer and a microphone"".

"""The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.""

"Continuously.  Let me explain.

Imagine a world where the price of operating a motor vehicle was constant, earsplitting noise.  One of two things would occur.  First, vehicle transport would become *wildly* unpopular, leading to a fundamentally altered society.  Granted this would probably involve a collapse of the auto industry and many other such things, which wouldn't be great, but, hey, at least we solve air pollution effectively overnight, right?  (Maybe.  Did not do the math.)

Or, alternatively, horns are simply disabled and/or removed from all motor vehicles.  Since (in my admittedly limited anecdotal experience) the vast majority of horn honking is tremendously unproductive and is simply contributing to road rage, this leads to lower incidence rates of traffic related violence, stress embolisms, etc, which can only be to the good.

My grandfather in WW2 lived in Ukraine and got pulled into the army by the Russians (not sure where he was actually put), he was also part German and so when he was captured, he told his captors that he was German.

"Reminds me of a story from my buddy, who works in a second-story office opposite an elementary school.

So one day he heads out to the balcony to have a smoke. Down below at a bus stop across the street are ""a dirty hobo guy and a dirty hobo girl"", going at it hard on the bench. She's on top of him and pumping for all she's worth, when suddenly they stop.

Hobo gal dismounts, moves to the side of the bus stop, squats, and takes a nice big dump right then and there.

Then she gets back up, climbs on the guy again, and they resume fucking like primates. Didn't even wipe.

Buddy called the cops, who arrived just in time to pick up the dirty fuckers before the kids came out at lunch break. Not sure who dealt with the turd on the ground though.

The Holocaust II: The Reich Strikes Back
"A joke theory I came up after hearing all the ""X character is actually from X House!"" theories aside from ones with actually good evidence or proven ones:

Theon Greyjoy is a secret Baratheon bastard. He was named Theon as the only clue to his heritage, much like the baby Barra that was the daughter of a whore and killed by Janos Slynt. He was still the son of Alyannys Harlaw(Balon's wife). This fact is what causes Balon to hate Theon and treat him like shit even as Theon thinks himself Balon's heir: Theon is not in the line of succession at all, and only half-Ironborn. The fact that he was raised in a Northern fashion half of his life only cemented this fact. With this, we can assume there are at least 5 Baratheon bastards still alive, at least in the books: Bella from the Riverlands, Mya Stone, Gendry from the Crownlands, and Edric Storm, along with secret Theon. 

Theon learns of this from Bran, and he is able to recruit other Baratheon bastards; let's call these guys Bert Sand, Reynold Flowers, Mannis Hill, and Lyanna Snow. These 9 bastards begin a new rebellion; Known as the Bastardtheon Revolt, each of these manage to conquer their respective lands, killing off every other named character except for Sam, Gilly, Baby Sam, Ser Pounce, Ellaria Sand, Tyene Sand, Ed Sheeran and Davos, and then each bastard becomes king/queen of their own area."

Treachery.

See, good people are bent on being benevolent to everyone and even stretching out a hand when people are neck-deep in shit. Good folks will go on with it, and because they are who they are, they'll ignore the ""red flags"" or bad omens, simply because they see the good in other people, rather than an opportunity or naivety.

Good people will get screwed over eventually by the people they helped, because the majority of the folks are selfish and look after themselves in any possible way. ""Bad"" people never had the sincere thought of paying back or thankfulness. They'll screw goodies over and never give even a single thought to it.

That's when shit gets ugly. Remember, every person has a limit. And when you screw over the trust and benevolence of a good person... So help you God if they ever snap fully. I remember a quote from Dr. Who: ""When good men go to war, even demons start to run.""

And it is completely true. I've seen good folks go ballistic because someone played their trust, which results in a situation where they get branded as NiceGuy/NiceGirl^TM , and once they are marked as such, it's them who get the short end of the stick. I've been there, I snapped on some of the people, and I got a lot of anguish holed up in me even still. I am afraid to even think what is it with other people.

Break of trust and treachery. Good people are good because they see the good in others, and most of the time they'll do their best to get that good out in the shiny sunny day. They try, they really do, and for anyone having a heart - it's an absolute joy to watch.

But when their trust and efforts are broken... The ugliest things happen."

I became vegan for both practical and political reasons. I love animals and dislike battery farming industries. I especially hate battery eggs. So I stopped eating meat and I stopped eating eggs. I am lactose intolerant so I already didnt eat dairy. Giving up honey, white bread and a few other little things was an easy next step.

I was a very likeable vegan if I do say so myself. If I asked for no bacon and a meal came with bacon, I either gave the bacon to someone else or ate it. No throwing away - that's wasteful. I didn't ask sandwich artists to change their gloves between touching meat and touching my sub because that's just extra trash which is bad for the environment. No need to wash pans and pots between the meaty meal and my meal, let's save water. I wanted so badly not to be a hypocrite. 

But it became impossible. 

Ultimately, eventually, I began to realize that if I really wanted to do this to do my bit to preserve the environment I'd eventually have to kill myself. Simply being alive meant I had to consume *something* that hurt Mother Nature. Vegetable industries were pretty hard on the environment too. Some were even worse than meat industries. Then there was animal testing. I already bought Australis cosmetics which weren't tested on animals and my soap and shampoo were both vegan. But what about cleaning products? Toiletries? Toothpaste? Clothes? Could I buy medication or accept medical interventions for health problems that had been tested on animals? I remember thinking that as I prepared to sign up for an exploratory surgery. 

As I got more and more into the vegan lifestyle, it got harder. More and more things were found by the vegan community to be not vegan. Bread, almonds, anything with red dye, certain tofu brands, a whole lot of tinned fruit, TVP, and white sugar. Pretty soon I was just eating potatoes and raw spinach.

The shitty diet made me sick. I was anaemic, depressed and suicidal. I got put on Olanzapine which made my appetite go crazy. I ballooned to 82kg. 82kg! I was a unicorn: a FAT vegan! My doctor said I needed to eat less carbs and more lean meat and dark leafy greens. I told him I was vegan and watched him wince. And the vegan community were cunts. Constantly scrutinizing other people's shopping carts and shrieking child abuse whenever they saw someone feeding meat to a child. Finally, I got into an argument with a woman who insisted it was okay to feed her cat a vegan diet because ""he's getting all the right nutrients!"" She wouldn't hear otherwise. That's when something in me clicked and I realized this was a colossal waste of time. I was putting my own health in jeopardy for nothing more than a pat on the back from people like this. 

Just like that, I gave up being vegan. I ate kangaroo for dinner that night and salivated the whole tine. I now enjoy meat, eggs and honey again. :) my energy levels increased and I started exercising again, got off Olanzapine and treated my depression with healthy food and exercise, lost weight due to no longer eating carbs for every meal and now I feel a hundred times better! 

Now I have a job where I travel a lot around Asia. Sometimes I don't get a say in my food. I have to eat what is handed to me. It's almost always delicious and it in a lot if places it is very rude to turn down food for anything other than an allergy. Being vegan would be very difficult now so I'm really pleased I gave it up."

"In high school I did zero homework. And never went to a single homeroom session.  Like not once from grade 9-12. Continually threatened with being failed. Always set to principals office. And parents losing thier minds by getting the calls and letters from staff. But, I was always prompt. Never skipped a day. Played a sport. And pretty respectful of everyone else. And tried in class. I came to the conclusion by end of middle school I simply wasnt an academic type. And was not going to college. My only goal was a passing grade. And a HS diploma. I had a few sit downs with my guidance counselor. Laid out my reasoning. In school you have my undivided. And homeroom was pointless except for attendence purposes. Once I step out its my time. Period. It worked. Ended up joining the USMC early at age 17. And after that they gave up trying.

"They usually search for hair and blood in a vehicle, not skin cells. Hair with attached follicles is a damning piece of evidence, blood doubly so.

Blood is found by removing the carpet and checking the metal underneath as well as sending carpet samples to a laboratory.

It's very difficult to hide the evidence of a dead body that was stored in a vehicle. Necrotic tissues are very different from living ones and a trained technician can tell the difference. Hair from a dead body is distinguishable from hair from a living person. The same is true of blood and other remains."

"I know this isn't the case for all but I just wanted to share my experience. I grew up poor and in a neighborhood of immigrants (am also). Most of our parents came to this country with no knowledge of the education system. On top of that they usually work a lot. I never really had someone on top of me checking if I had been getting good grades or not. Even applying to college was a struggle because my parents didn't understand why I had to do things like volunteer, stay in school late for clubs, and pay for the SAT. I was lucky to go to a school program that actually educated us about college. For some time though I went to my regular neighborhood school. The mentality there was that school didn't really matter. You are allowed to work at a young age (at least in my state) and making money was more important. Plus people didn't even consider going to college as a viable option. I actually had a friend in the program who shared his experience. He had a sister older than him who was brilliant and got good grades but had to sacrifice college to support the family (temporarily they said). After learning that it completely discouraged him in school and after he just coasted by."

They largely had access to the same teaching and educational resources. And still, students from lower income homes under-performed vs their more privileged peers. Hope that clears up why his findings were surprising. It's not as simple as, ""well yeah obviously students with better resources and teachers will test better."""

Our graveyard was also on the largest road that ran through our town, and it became very winding at that section.

Streetlights flicker on and off when I walk or drive past them, to the point where friends have taken me driving over and over past a row of streetlights in different cars to test whether it's me, or something else affecting the lights. 

I can sense electrical surges before they happen, but only seconds before, as if I can feel a change in the atmosphere. 

I can also put my hand to items with a charge (for example, the plug end of a power cord) and take the shock as if I am absorbing the energy so someone else doesn't get shocked. I tap my hand with the end of cables whenever I unplug them from an outlet.

"A TL;DR of /r/personalfinance:

1) Never buy a car, ever. Commute for hours or walk through a mountain to get to work, but no car whatsoever. 

2) Buying a house? Why though? Rent for life until you can make upwards of 40% downpayment in cash.

If you don't have that much in cash, a house is never an option.

3) All stocks and any type of investment is stupid, all you buy is one bond ETF and one S&amp;P 500 index ETF. GTFO if you are in anything else. 

4) *'I saved $50,000 in 2 year - thanks to this sub'* - thread erupts in cheers (never mind the fact that I got a house for free, my dad gifted my $25,000 for living expenses, I rented my free house and moved back with parents and landed a silicon valley job, with education all paid for)

/r/personalfinancecanada is even worse, ALL the sub talks is Canadian Couch Potato (CPP) portfolios which are index funds, this is IT.

Their TL;DR:

1) I saved 20% downpayment in today's market, any tips?

Answer: You don't need a house, invest in CCP.

2) Can I buy a car? I commute 5 hours daily? 

Answer: Save now, no car for you invest in CCP.

3) I need a vacation

Answer: CCP 

4) I need to get married, have kids

"Back when my husband and I were living in North Carolina we had some weird shit happen at our apartment.


It was a two bed/two bath...one bath was never used. One night, my husband was asleep in our room, I was in the living room watching TV. I heard a noise, followed it and found the unused bathroom sink on. I freak the fuck out, wake my husband up who goes room by room with a shotgun. We found nothing, so we both went to bed.


As soon as we both laid down, we heard footsteps in our kitchen. My husband grabs his gun again, and peeks out into the kitchen. Nothing. He comes back to our room, shortly after the footsteps start up again. We both said fuck it, stayed put and tried to sleep. 


It never happened again and we never figured out what it was. "

My mom had to fight to get me back into the other school, it was awful. The boarders changed to make sure the wealthy neighborhoods went to the big wealthy school, and to make sure the farm kids and Latino areas had to go the poorer school.

And it was now too late to work for another company for the same show, so we were pissed. They still said we could choose ONE article of clothing before leaving. They had our options on a small rack and it was the ugliest shit I've ever seen. I saw another rack that said ""DO NOT TOUCH."" The original shirt I wanted was there, so I walked up, took it off the hanger, and put it in my bag. As we were backstage there was a girl who wouldn't stop bragging about these three tank tops she won from one of the designers. They were nothing special. Plain colored tanks. But she must have mentioned them 20 times that day and how special she was because they said she was the only one who would look good in them. So I took those too. "

"The BBC was where Toronto was claimed to be the most diverse purely on the basis that Toronto holds the most nationalities. I guess it all depends on how you would define diverse in this context. 

I like to think diversity includes how diverse cultures are able to live among one another rather than simply next to each other. It's easy to have a city that has different areas for different nationalities (re: Five Points in NYC) but I think there's some bonus points in there for how well a city is able to blend together the nationalities rather than simply carve out an area for one another.

Well I had this dog that would take something of yours and run off some where so you'd go off recovering that thing. Whilst you're gone she'd eat your cereal or something. But then it took to running off with the toilet paper when my kid brother was having a shit on the training toilet so she can eat the said turd when my brother waddles off.......So she was pretty clever and stupid at the same time.

"A lot of people are saying there's something wrong with him for feeling that way, but I have to throw my two cents in. When I date someone, I like to connect with them by spending time with them, and if dates have to get cancelled or rescheduled or ended early or interrupted too often by *anything*, whether it's an extremely demanding job or a child, that's frustrating.

A few years ago, I would have said that doesn't matter and I'd put up with it for the right woman, but recently I've realized I have a pattern of giving too much to my partners and not getting my own needs met. It's good to be generous and accepting, but when I don't take care of myself, ultimately it degrades the relationship too.

I don't blame this guy. Probably hurt like a bitch when he left though, and you have my sympathy."

"And wash ya damn face! 

And not with shampoo, not with that generic Axe-y body wash, and not with hand soap/whatever is on hand. Find what kind of skin you have and find a face wash that suits it. Using the wrong cleanser can definitely aggravate your skin and make it extra oily, which can lead to breakouts. Oh, and maybe slap a lil moisturizer on too if you have time, just a tiny pump is usually good. I personally like cetaphil because it's fragrance free and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. "

"My brother's room growing up was kind of like that. It was a real party house before my parents bought it. Like, one step above a crack house. At their housewarming party they had a couple of some biker gang show up and hang out for a few hours before they realized it had new owners. 

Anyway, they had spray painted all over the walls in that room. Heights, Phone numbers, all kinds of shit. So my mother painted over it, but didn't prime it right and it started coming through the surface paint eventually. Looked crazy as fuck to see the name ""Mike,"" slowly fade through the barnyard landscape she painted on the wall."

"To be fair, he said it ""the porn *industry*"" not porn itself. I've known an ex-pornstar personally, and she was extremely messed up after that. Apparently drug abuse is rampant and most of the girls are addicts. They're usually girls who failed out of college or came from shitty backgrounds, and the producers lure them with lots of cash. 

Then, they're in that lifestyle, making more money than they've ever seen and spending it as fast as they make it. Once they're ~24, though, the jobs quickly dry up (assuming they didn't make it to superstar status). The money stops and they're left in expensive areas with no family (because they have been keeping their life secret), and addicted to drugs.

It's not a healthy industry, honestly. I've got no problem with porn *itself*, but there are a lot of shady people doing shady things to take advantage of young women. There's actually a push by sex workers around the world to start unionizing, so hopefully they start turning the industry around soon.

"**I have full-spectrum synaesthesia.**

Literally every one of my sensory perceptions - including ones that you wouldn't normally think to list, like a sense of balance, of heat, or of time - is tied to every other one.

Quite a few folks seem to regard it as a superpower, but they may be overestimating exactly how useful it really is.

To answer a few common questions:

------

**""Have you always been this way?**    
As far as I know, I've always been synaesthetic to some degree. I can remember getting into an argument with my kindergarten teacher about the color of the number four, for example. (That variety of synaesthesia is incredibly common.) As for the rest of the crossover, I can't recall a time when I *didn't* have it, but I only started talking about it at age fourteen or so. Before then, I just assumed that everyone perceived things in a similar way.

**""Does it ever get overwhelming?""**    
Sensory bombardment isn't really an issue for me. I don't physically see, hear, or smell any of the sensations associated with my usual senses, I just... well, the best way to put it would be to say that I *perceive* them. There are times when things like loud, crowded concerts can get a little bit overwhelming, but that's less a function of my synaesthesia and more a function of my personality.

Honestly, the *most* overwhelming thing is when folks bombard me with questions about how their name tastes, how their voice looks, or what particular sound I might associate with their body odor.

**""What's it like? Do you enjoy it?""**    
Do you enjoy seeing or hearing? Keep in mind, I've never known anything different. As for how it feels to actually experience synaesthesia of this degree, try this: Right now, I want you to picture a glass of ice water. It's cold to the touch, with just a hint of dampness from the condensation. The faint scent of freezer burn emanates from within. The ice makes quiet cracking noises, followed by a light, almost melodic tone as it clinks against its container. If you picture it with enough intensity, you can almost imagine the sensation of sipping at the water, feeling it chill your lips and tongue as you swallow... but of course, you *can't* actually feel it, because it's not actually there. It's just your mind creating those sensations for you. 

It's a little bit like that.

**""Does it benefit you in any way?""**    
To a certain extent, yes. I've found that writing comes easily to me, because I tend to pair words and thoughts in a way that produces a pleasant composition. It's a question of combining colors, shapes, sounds, smells (and so on) to evoke imagery and emotion. In the past, I've compared it to fitting kaleidoscopic shapes together in order to make music, and my written works have a certain ""melody"" to them as a result.

**""What does my (INSERT THING HERE) smell/taste/sound/feel/look like?""**    
Like I said, that question gets exhausting.

------

"When I was an overweight kid, I used to eat a lot of empty calories. One time I resorted to eating handfuls of raw sugar out of the cupboard. Apparently I left some remnants on the counter because later I heard my dad call out from the kitchen asking who left a sugary mess. In my shame I lied, claiming ignorance. He took one look at me, smiled and told me to look in the mirror. When I did, I realized that I had gotten sugar all over my chubby, pubescent face.

"I find it ironic in a sad way that certain fans are trying to silence and censor other fans. Most of these fans are in their teens or early twenties and probably aren't even aware that fanfics (especially certain subgenres, such as slash), and even the concept of fandom itself, used to be heavily stigmatised. These kids are lucky that they grew up in a time where they have places to post fanworks without being censored, but they still somehow want to take that away from other fans. They should honestly read up on the history of fandom.

I especially find it appalling that many people are willing to dox, harass, suicide bait, and [*even attempt murder*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/6akpsc/a_fan_literally_tried_to_murder_a_fanartist_over/) over fanworks and ships, and then celebrate when people actually do attempt suicide.

"I can honestly say that I am not happy with my health care. I work for a Fortune 500 company, and they claim that between the two of us we pay over $800 a month for my health care. First, I don't believe them. I think that is the list price of my health care and they pay 80% of that list price. However, I believe they've negotiated that price down because the coverage I get out of it is pure s***. No diagnostic procedure is paid for until I have spent $1,200 out of pocket. Durable medical equipment is leased and not purchased so that my portion is often larger than theirs. They don't begin paying for everything until I hit $4,000 out of my pocket. Even then, they can decline to pay certain things if I have selected doctors out-of-network. It's garbage and the CEO of the company that provides it doesn't live like a king, because most Kings could never aspire to such lavish wealth."

Sometimes I hear the beginning of the sentence but not the end. Sometimes I hear the end but not the beginning so I only need the first few words repeated. 

If they're cutting you off because they've figured out what you've said, they're probably trying to save you from having to repeat yourself more than necessary because they feel guilty for asking you to do it in the first place. 

And also, hearing aids are difficult to get and cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. It's not always a matter of ""refusing"" to get them, sometimes it isn't an option financially. "

"An ICD can only shock VT/VF.

3) NEVER ask if it's in. Just fucking check. 

4) Pay close attention to her face and body language for how shit's going. Ask her what she wants.

5) Don't come in her mouth, eyes, hair, ears, purse without asking permission (ESPECIALLY the purse)

6) Pee afterwards. If you notice she doesn't then politely remind her

7) Repeat"
"And the power of optimism. We generally point to the 50s as a time of prosperity for the US, but that was before civil rights, and much of the country was abhorrently racist.

But only in blue states like California that were going to go blue anyway, because that's a sound strategy. All to embarrass Trump once he won rather than actually, y'know, win the election themselves. Trump stated all this with no evidence, and now his team is starting with the conclusion and working backward to justify it, requesting info on every voting American, including party affiliation and partial SSN. Seems legit."

"I went vegan during a time when it was especially easy to go vegan: graduate school.  I was single, many of my classmates and local friends were at least vegetarian, and I spent a lot of time by myself anyway, holed up writing my dissertation.  I've never really been a foodie either.  (I suspect that many of the irrationalities about wine that have been confirmed by studies also exist for food in general.)

Anyway, at that time in my life it was incredibly easy for me to buy exactly what I needed at the grocery store and be vegan.  The problem was those rare instance when I shared meals with non-vegetarians (for example: family).  Otherwise, it was really easy.  Incidentally, I was at my absolute healthiest at this time too, because living by myself and writing meant that I could control my schedule to the extreme; I had a great exercise routine and ate healthy.  I was in great shape.

Once I received my degree, it became harder to maintain my dietary standards, along with the rest of my lifestyle, because I was eating with people more, often unpredictably.  Once I started living with my girlfriend (now wife), who is not even vegetarian, it became a lot harder.  I never wanted to impose my dietary choices on her, but she understands them and even tries very hard to reduce the amount of meat she eats, in spite of being a serious foodie.  So now I'm pescatarian, and she eats land animals only a couple of times a week."

I was so close to being clean and healthy and I've just stumbled down this rabbit hole of being exhausted and self medicating. While maintaining working a million hours a week because it distracts me from being miserable. 

I literally just go through the motions. I convince myself I'm happy and okay. But there's just no way that's true.

Smart phones are so important for poor teens, especially those in at-risk/abusive/crummy environments. First, google classroom is the new vogue in education so textbooks, papers, math homework, etc., are often entirely online. While their richer peers use home wifi and computers/laptops to do homework, I've known so many poorer teens use their smartphones to load entire virtual books, write entire papers, etc., on those tiny screens. Determination is real. Smart phones connect those teens to social service providers, crisis lines, more stable family members in other areas, food pantries, college admissions officers, and in emergency situations, first responders. When they're kicked out because mom's on drugs or whatnot, the phone goes with them. When they're homeless because boyfriend's dad set the house on fire again, phone goes with them. If someone tries to abduct them while walking to the store, they have a phone with GPS that can be tracked and they tend to know it. The smartphone isn't the problem with poverty; the complex system that works to keep poor folk poor is the problem."

"Clean all the time even when things didn't *look* dirty.

I couldn't understand why we cleaned the house top to bottom every weekend. Some of it I understood, like bathrooms and the kitchen and doing the laundry. But I didn't understand why we vacuumed every room and mopped the floor too, along with cleaning parts of the house we hadn't been in.

Now that I'm a home owner, I get it. First, just because it doesn't *look* dirty doesn't mean it isn't. And secondly, it gets you in the habit of cleaning, gives you a routine so that you actually force yourself to do it. "

He was not deterred by the fact he couldn't fit and I had to physically redirect him to the now open side of the door. Also, I had a deck that was missing a lower railing, and on his predictable patrol of the fence line, he would always jump through that opening. I fixed the railing once, and he first got stuck trying to jump through it, freed himself, and then headbutted it a couple times until it broke again.

"I am very much, for the most part, a ""too each their own"" kind of person when it comes to parenting. I wouldn't want someone being a dick about how I want to raise my kid, so I won't do it to another person. However, there was this one situation where it was *so hard* to not call CPS.


My husband, daughter and I were playing at the park. Shortly after we get there, these two women and about five kids (probably all under five...my daughter was four at the time and all the kids appeared to be her age or younger). 


The older kids run off, there is a baby in a stroller sitting with the two women. One of the ladies is drinking from a two liter of Mountain Dew. This bitch whips a bottle out of the basket of the stroller, fills it with MD and gives it to the baby. 


I'm thinking ""Ok...that is some shit"", but say nothing. Eventually the women want to go, instead of calling their kids back like normal people, they shout ""Get your fucking asses over here"", and when they didn't immediately move, ""I'm going to beat your ass"". One kid was moving a little slow (she looked like she was in the just getting a handle on walking stage) and one of the women said ""You stupid bitch, you better get your ass over here before you get beat"". 


Holy. Shit. I saw red, guys. 


So, they leave. I look at my husband and we both knew we had to follow them. So we leave, tagging slowly behind them. They ended up going into the homeless shelter that is on our street. If they hadn't gone there, CPS would have been called, for sure. I'd like to think they were just *really* down on their luck and in a shit mood because of it (not that it justifies their behavior...I just figured more shit on top of being homeless wouldn't help the situation). 


That was like, four or five summers ago and I still wonder how those kids are doing. "

"Probably going to get down voted to hell with this, but oh well. I’m the exact opposite. I design and program automation. I know damn well how hard and time consuming it can be to program a vision camera to detect a feature on a part. There are a ton of variables at play with this, everything from focus, lighting, angle, filtering just to name a few. A lot of the time you can control these environments so that the vision is repeatable and reliable. But even then, some dust on the lens can throw everything off. Now you add these into vehicles, where they are exposed to the elements and everything crappy in the real word. I’m sorry, but you can’t have a computer and camera and an array of sensors of any kind detect all the possible objects in every single possible situation. I will be that old guy that will be dead cold in the ground before I let a car drive for me in the real world.

The one thing that computers can’t do that our monkey brains can, is adapt to the situation. If you want to change how a computer handles a situation differently, you have to reprogram it, and that takes time. Our brains can adapt quickly to a situation to make adjustments. Is it perfect? Nope, people make mistakes. But it’s better than a computer. A computer will just sit there or get caught up trying to think how to handle it.

The only thing that will change my mind over this, is that if there will be a master system that looks over every single vehicle on the road and it controls each single one. I’m not saying that you’re wrong, it’s just we as a species still have a ton of work to do before I can see this be any kind of reliable.

"I don't work in surveillance BUT, I live in Philadelphia and follow the ""waverlywanks"" Instagram account where someone posts footage from their home security camera that faces their front steps.  They live on a beautiful side street which is a block long situated in an area surrounded by clubs.  They have wide front steps which are recessed from the street and can't be seen from either end of the block.  They frequently find late-night rendezvous have occurred, usually clearly involving transexual hookers.  They also occasionally find the paper delivery guy being an asshole and skipping papers through puddles up to peoples doors. 

My wife and I walk down that street during the day sometimes and have run into the owners of the house while, of all things, power washing their steps.  We stopped and spoke to them about it; apparently they find it amusing which is why they started the waverlywanks account. Unfortunately they had their original account (""waverlywank"") removed for not following community guidelines... but they've been back as waverlywanks (minus a great back-catalogue of footage). "

What folks don't realize is that the military rules are strict and effectively set in stone.

How your chain of command CHOOSES to enforce those rules (if broken, or not) is something entirely different.

I was sorta stuck with the same unit throughout my career due to TDYs and other deployments, but I was always attached to another specific unit/company when I did so.

One unit I spent most of my time with them (45 days out of 90) with an article 15. Did everything they could to ding me for anything they could find, which is really a lot. It started when they did a barracks inspection instead of PT one day, and of course, that was a Monday and drinking occurred that weekend and I had an empty booze bottle in my trash.

Unbeknownst to me, there were some extremely strict rules against this, that were slightly under the radar or otherwise not explicitly stated. Next thing I knew I was talking to my actual company commander because I was suddenly a 'soup sandwich' because they were able to find multiple other rules I broke. My captain talked em out of basically everything except extra duty, but these folks were measuring my hair, taking pictures of my boots, demanding I get piss tested, etc etc etc. so I basically was their bitch doing all their busywork for most of the time I was there. Still not exactly sure why, but scuttlebutt said that the commander was a hardcore straightedge who also threw the Bible around like crazy, and everyone else just learned to keep their heads down or transferred. Totally fucking weird to this day.

Another unit I was attached to? First thing that happened is the platoon sgt, top, and xo took me and my team out to eat, drink, and go to a titty bar all on their dime. Even got a silly award before I left.

Was still the same soldier. Still did my job the right way, the first time, each time. But may god have mercy on your soul if you do the wrong thing in the wrong unit."

"""If"" by Rudyard Kipling.


If you can keep your head when all about you  

Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  
 
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

But make allowance for their doubting too;  
 
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,

Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,

And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:


If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  
 
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; 
  
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

And treat those two impostors just the same; 
  
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:


If you can make one heap of all your winnings

And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

And lose, and start again at your beginnings

And never breathe a word about your loss;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

To serve your turn long after they are gone,
   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you

Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’


If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   

Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

If all men count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, 
  
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,  

And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

There was this girl in high school who was addicted to sex. She had sex with every guy she knew. Me being young and horney I agreed to have sex with her. In the end I canceled the sex date because it didn't feel right. months later it turned out that she was pregnant and had unprotected sex with every guy. I could have knocked her up.

"This is a throwaway account because it is an incredibly painful experience to recount. 

I hate that this is the first thread I have something to response with. I will never forget this experience as long as I live. This is all a little jumbled but I need to get this out. Yes, I was student-teaching when a third-grade student was hit by a driver and died unexpectedly. A ball had gone into the street, he ran to get the ball, the first car stopped as to not hit him--but the second car wasn't paying attention and slammed into the first car that eventually hit the child. Fuck, picturing his empty desk to this day will make me tear up. His older sister, who also went to the school pulled his mangled body out of underneath the van (allegedly his arm was ripped from his body). He was life flighted and didn't make it through the night. 

Having to tell the students as they walked in was one of the hardest parts. Seeing their happy faces walking in knowing I was about to deliver some news that would forever change their life was so incredibly difficult. Watching them grapple with such tough emotions while going through my own was so difficult. I remember getting the call from my mentor that he had been hit by a car and just crying into my now ex-boyfriends arms at a time saying ""he's so little"" again and again. What really has messed with me the most is my last few images of him running through the playground without a care. I watched him get on the bus that day with no idea it would be his last. 

Kids are resilient as fuck. They are so much more capable than we give them credit for. I will never forget crying in a circle with my students feeling a little arm on my back and having a ""tough"" student comfort me. Rubbing my back and wiping my tears. 

I don't even know if I can speak to the school changing. The days go on, the learning continues, and the students adapt. It has taught me to love the students in front of me, and to cherish each moment. "

I strongly believe in the exact opposite, and we've been trying to work together to get a healthier vision of what a relationship should look like. It's very hard, sometimes, to wade forward in life with little idea of what should or should not be happening. Sometimes, taking it moment by moment helps :)"

Now you have a number of kids making good money and that's your retirement plan.  More kids == higher chance some of them will succeed.

"And the real answer to most of these are ""we're fucking broke, so we have to be frugal."" 

That means we don't want to eat out a lot.

It means we use paper towels over napkins because we don't want to buy multiple types of paper products (yes, we've been accused of killing the [napkin industry](http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-hate-napkins-2016-3).) 

If means we have cheaper weddings, don't buy diamonds, wait until later in life to get married and have kids (or in many cases not have kids at all).

Not everyone refuses to throw a fancy wedding because they think it's a waste of money. In a lot of cases it's because we can't afford it, and then we justify the decision after the fact. Many of us would *love* have the disposal income to do this kind of shit, *and* have money left over to buy a house, support a family, save for retirement, and pay off student loans. But we just don't.

The woman is cancerous to so many young children mainly because the diet she's famous for is ""perfect"" for some stages in eating disorders - the idea that you can eat whatever you want as much as you want as long as it's raw, vegan and 100 bananas a day. However some respond to this diet by gaining weight and relapsing to more strict diets than this already strict one. And both cause severe nutrient deficiency. "
"I've dealt with lifelong depression and anxiety. Oftentimes when I am lonely its because of a lack of excitement and then I get boreda because I'm doing nothing. Getting yourself ""un-bored"" is impossible unless you allow yourself to be bored--this has been the case for me anyway. Accept you're bored and lonely, and do things anyway. Say ""what would I do if I weren't bored"" and do it, even if its shitty and boring (which it will be). Eventually you'll get caught up in something (don't get me wrong, sometimes this can take days, other times, hours) and like a veil being removed, you'll suddenly be okay for awhile, and since you're okay, you keep doing what you're doing; preventing further boredom.  

I've done this practise for years now, and now when I feel hopless, lonely, or bored, I hop in my bed. I say to myself: ""I feel this way, and I'm going to feel like it all day and fuck anyone who says differently"". I then stare at the wall until I'm bored of being bored.

4. Team leader decides to give the pill to the patient

5. Friend takes the pill away from her and goes to get the doctor

6. Team leader calls for the ... like ... whoever is above a team leader amongst nurses, I'm not sure.

7. Friend gets chewed out for not giving the pill to the patient, even though over-dosing is way more dangerous than simply waiting until the next time when the patient is supposed to take the pills to give it to him. But also - it was on his bed. Like eww.

"Yeah, no.  

Not everyone is out to make a lot of money and have other priorities in life. If you only see succes as earning a lot of money you might just be living a different lifestyle/have different ideas about life.  
Take me for example. I am 30 and do wallclimbing and fitness (added training for the climbing). I have a degree in IT and Economics. I worked in the private sector for 5 years and hated it. Always working late with as good as no compensation (is as good as expected) and the only good thing was the payment.  

Yet I quit all that and went to work for the government (also IT-manager). But now I am sure I only work 38 hours a week. And if I have to work longer I can take those extra hours as vacation on another day (or get paid in overtime...). I have 32 days vacation a  year instead of 20. I can't get fired (unless I steal). My wage for the rest of my life is in berama's, so it's all set out.  
The downside? I dropped in wage. No company car, 1709€/month (which is ok for Belgium).  

But now I can actually live my life. I have plenty of free time. And my life isn't for working."

"I once flew America -&gt; Canada -&gt; France 

In the US we had a big ass steak knife we were using to cut fruit and somehow it got stuck in the bag too. Got through TSA no problem. Canada was like ""hey you know that bag of food, you have a knife in there"" Left it with Canada no problem or questions asked.

Another time, US -&gt; Japan -&gt; Vietnam. US stops me because I have one of those little bike tool kits in my backpack, they decide I can keep the toolkit but they have to take the bits to the socket wrench - if give it to them and continue on my merry way. Japan customs have to go through security again. Super polite, ""we think you have a knife in your wallet"". oh shit! I do have one of those foldable credit card knives in my wallet. Surrender the knife and continue again 

I'm sure that guy wasn't the only one with a knife on your plane. Also I need to stop bringing knives on planes before I get banned for life...

She wasn't wearing underwear, so it was definitely true. but he was fired the next day. 3) another dude was fired for having sex with someone three levels below him in a supply closet.

"Gary, Indiana. I was driving through at 3pm, and I saw MAYBE 3 people in the entire city. There were houses where there were no doors, some of them even had lights.

On top of that, I'm pretty sure the people there mate with fish from the surrounding ponds and swamps cause the people there and in the nearby gas stations had a rather Fish-like appearance. Either that or there's some sort of chemical spill in their water, which I could also believe.

"The bar scheme:  
Two women will approach a guy, and strike up a conversation. They will then suggest they go to a bar, and encourage the guy to buy them each a drink, or two. They get as many drinks out of the guy as they can, and then the tab shows up. Guy didn't realize that the bar charges an exorbitant amount of money for the drinks. (They will often have two price lists, one for regular guests, and one for the targeted marks.) If the mark objects to the bill, either a bouncer, a security guard, or a ""Police"" officer will compel them through threats of violence or legal trouble to pay up, going so far as to escort them to an ATM. Meanwhile, the women have ghosted, and are working on finding the next mark.

"I found MFP to be both frustrating and helpful. It was frustrating because it was a huge pain to figure out the calorie count of a homemade meal - I never usually measure my ingredients, and even when I do, I always save some of the meal for leftovers. Also, I noticed at least a couple discrepancies between the calorie counts in the app and actual calories (Trader Joe's bagels were listed as 300-something in the app; 200-something on the package, if I remember correctly). What finally got me to stop using it was when I thought I'd been really good about accurately counting calories and exercise for a whole week, only to *gain* weight instead of losing it (as I was supposed to, according to the app).

But despite all these frustrations, I think it was a very worthwhile exercise. It got me to look up calorie counts for a lot of things and think much harder about portion size. Even though I don't use it anymore, I feel like I still make smarter choices and I'm better about not overeating."

"Somewhere in the world, there is a woman.

Perhaps I should clarify. Somewhere in the world, there is a *specific* woman.

Every time that I interact with this individual, I am offered at least one piece of obscure celebrity gossip. While that would be irritating enough on its own, each one of these tidbits is accompanied by a story which suggests that the woman in question was actually present to see the story unfold. She never paints herself as any kind of main character, but she does make the claim - either indirectly or overtly - that she has a personal relationship with whomever she might be referencing.

For example, a certain public figure recently had a birthday. (No, not that one.) After telling me this fact, the woman had the following exchange with me:

------

**WOMAN:** You know, I used to go over to her house all the time.    
**ME:** Really.    
**WOMAN:** Yes, she would always greet me with some kind of very thoughtful gift.    
**ME:** How nice of her.    
**WOMAN:** Oh, well, she's always been a very warm sort of woman. She would invite me in, and she'd just say, ""Hey, I was thinking of you, and I got you this!"" and it would always be some kind of very thoughtful gift.    
**ME:** What sort of things would she get you?    
**WOMAN:** ... Oh, well, I mean, I can't really remember, but it would always be some kind of very thoughtful gift. You know? She's always been a very warm sort of woman, though.

------

Now, I'll confess that the first dozen or so times I heard one of these stories, I believed them. They didn't *sound* like the sort of thing that a pathological liar would offer, given that there was very little self-aggrandizement and almost nothing that stood out as being worthy of suspicion. As I started to really pay attention, though, I noticed that nearly every piece of trivia was a word-for-word match to something that could be gleaned from a fan site or a Wikipedia page... and more damning still was the fact that whenever the woman would reference some sort of professional expertise, she'd show a curious lack of knowledge about the field she was discussing:

------

**WOMAN:** You know, I used to help run his fan page.    
**ME:** Really.    
**WOMAN:** Yes, he really put a lot of trust in me that way.    
**ME:** How nice of him.    
**WOMAN:** Oh, well, he's always been very grateful to his fans. He'd tell me that he wanted to reach out to them, and we'd make sure that the site got updated very soon after that.    
**ME:** You must be pretty good with HTML, then.    
**WOMAN:** ... Oh, well, I mean, this was back in the 2000s, so HPML didn't exist yet. We had to do it the old-fashioned way. You know? He's always been very grateful to his fans, though.

------

You get the idea.

As near as I can tell, this woman's existence revolves around watching television, imagining that she's friends with actors, and inventing skills that she thinks will make her stories sound believable. Calling her out wouldn't really do anyone any good, though, so I just humor her whenever she starts talking my ear off.

Even so... it's annoying.

"When they make sure to tell you that you cost them money until you get up to speed, and it would be good to come in on my free time to get there, or they ""normally hire other types of people"" but will extend the job offer to you. Both of these happened to me and I told them I wasn't interested after they offered me a job. 

I don't train on my own dime and I refuse to take a job from someone acting like they're doing me a favor. Especially when I'm more qualified than those they normally hire. "

I am not a person who talks too much and prefer some quiet.  Probably that's the reason why I always liked the saying 'True friendship comes when the silence between two people is comfortable.'
"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Also - this is a mostly true story, with certain details changed to protect the identities of those involved.  
  
I got a girl pregnant in college, she was 18 and I was 20, so she was in her teens. The initial shock gets you, but once you get past it, it's not the end of the world. Just requires some grit and willingness to work together.  
  
I made a commitment to her that I'd support her as best as I could up until the child was born, then we both agreed to give the child up for adoption (we were both pro-life and came from conservative households, so we were more or less on the same page on that one). My family was supportive of me and my decision, her family was less so as they were more traditional and thought she should either marry me or let them raise their child. We were adamantly against that because we knew we were young and didn't want to permanently commit ourselves to anything. Plus, we didn't think it would be fair for the child.   
  
We split the medical costs leading up to the birth and I gave her rides to and from doctor's appointments. I let her make all the decisions about medical care. I also was emotionally supportive of her. Let me tell you, a pregnant 18 year old woman will go through rapid mood swings and you have to be willing to drop everything to soothe or calm her down. I don't mean that as a slight to women, it's just simple biology.   
  
However, I did insist on having equal say in the adoption process which proved to be a sticking point. Throughout the process, the agency employees kept noting how unusual it was for the guy to be involved. To me, it just seemed like common sense. It's my child too and I want to have a say. Eventually, the adoptive couple I had selected got the child, only because the couple she had selected backed out for financial reasons. She was pretty cold to me after that, as I think she carried a lot of bitterness over the fact that the couple she selected did not ""win"" out. I honestly thought it was a little petty of her, but at the same time, she's 18 and pregnant so I cut her some slack and didn't make a fuss about it. Any romance between us was basically gone after that.  
  
She started seeing another guy, and I really didn't mind at that point, but I just wanted to keep being supportive of her and do the responsible thing. She started relying on him more and more for rides / emotional support, so I just backed off because it was clear that I was causing tension in her new romance. Why in the world she thought it was a good idea to start a new romance while she's carrying another guy's child and that it wouldn't be an issue is beyond me. But then again, 18 and pregnant, so I kept those opinions to myself.  
  
The last time I saw her was when she had the child. I held the child briefly, spoke to the adoptive couple, and then I left. Throughout the entire process I feel like I did my fair share. I also didn't engage in any romance because I wanted to be available if she needed me. It just seemed like the right thing to me. After the birth / hand off to the adoptive couple, I felt like I had successfully fulfilled my obligations to her and resumed my love life.  
  
I will say, I think she's a great gal with a lot going for her. She was also very cordial to me despite disagreements we had. We never once yelled or fought, only had civil discussions and tried to get to a reasonable conclusion.   
  
I still get updates from the adoptive couple. It's awesome to see how adoption makes a couple so happy and completes a family. I'm glad I could give this gift to them. I'm also really happy for my biological daughter because she's got a great life, she's killing it at school, loves nerdy stuff like me, and seems extraordinarily happy. I keep a photo album of all their updates and thumb through it from time to time. It's a great lifter upper when I am down. The biological mother and I do not have a relationship / talk any more.  
  
All in all, I wouldn't change anything about what happened after we found out we were pregnant. I'm honestly pretty proud of myself and I think I did the best job I could to help support her. In summary, I would say a teen pregnancy is 90% perspiration and 10% inspiration. Yes, it can be stressful, it's a lot of work, and it can get frustrating sometimes and even downright painful. But then you see your baby moving on an ultrasound, or feel it's kick, or hold it and you immediately see how it's all worth it. The instincts kick in and it's truly an incredible experience. Fatherhood, for the brief time I had it, is one of the greatest things a man can do with his life.  
  
TL;DR: Went through a teen pregnancy. Stuck it out and supported a pregnant girl through it. We went our separate ways afterwards. It's a lot of work, but also very inspiring. It can change your life for the better or worse, depending on the decisions you make. For me, it vastly improved me as a person."

"i've fucked every cousin and a stepcousin.  they were all hot, and there was a high drive to do so.  Sex was also a very forbidden topic in my christian household, so maybe that's why I was so driven to do it.  I recently fucked my cousin again 2 years ago after she divorced her husband.  We hadn't fucked since we were younger, so I didn't really think that's why she wanted me to come down.  She just said she wanted me to see her place and hang out for a couple days since we needed to catch up.  Apparently catch up meant fucking almost nonstop for 3 days.  It felt a little weird when she told me I was the best guy she had fucked.  Recently she found a new guy and I haven't heard from her since, so hopefully he is better at fucking since that was probably the last time I ever want to fuck any of my cousins since we're getting older.  
   
I'm not sure if I feel better or worse for typing this all out.  I'm also not sure if I'm some degenerate or if it's natural to want to fuck a cousin if she's very attractive.  It was always just lust, not love though, so I have no idea.

"Every year I have a chat with my class about tattling vs telling. We have a triage system in place where (in most cases) problems can be handled by the student first before telling a teacher. For example, 1st you try to ignore. Then you ask them to stop. If that doesn't work, you move away from them. If they follow you, move by a teacher. 95% of the time, the behavior stops by step 4. 

Some of them get way too used to tattling for every little thing. I think it's important to teach problem solving skills that can be used later on in life."

"I don't think so. We were married for five years, and during those five years, I spent every waking moment doing everything I could for her. I was a military spouse, and it was difficult for me to find gainful employment moving every two years, so I focused on building a home for her. I kept it clean, washed her laundry, cooked for her every day, hell, even rubbed her feet until she fell asleep rather frequently. Meanwhile, she would come home angry about something that happened at work, take it out on me, and I would just let her. She told me that she had more respect for her coworkers than for me because I wasn't military. She would hit me sometimes if I did something that she didn't like. After all this, I would smile and scratch her back, or read to her until she fell asleep while she was out of town for work. 

It's been three weeks since I drove away, and I'm seeing someone else. It seems fast, but I'm so tired of crying myself to sleep. She (my ex wife) cheated on me with her ""best friend"" who raped her while we were dating. This ate at me for awhile until I swallowed a handfull of pills. I called an ambulance, went to the hospital, and while I was being treated, she went and got drunk and fucked some dude whose name she didn't even know. I don't know why parts of me still want her. I feel like maybe she can change, but the rest of me knows she won't.

This girl I'm seeing now makes me feel good about myself. For the last five years, I've felt so ugly, like I deserved all the mistreatment my ex wife put me through, but... Since I've been seeing this other woman, I feel like I'm worthy. 

If you're out there reading this, and trust me, you know who you are, I hope the memories of what I did for you burn your soul. I hope one day you realize how horribly you treated the person who would have done anything for you, who did everything he could for you, and you just collapse into a pile of tears and regret. And I hope that it makes you a better person.

But I know it won't."

"I'm not OP but I was purged. My track record with voting was always Independent or Democrat. I hadn't moved or received jury summons. I voted in the primary with no problem. The day of the election I showed up with voter registration and my valid driver's license and I was turned away. That week, the county clerk was instructed to purge voters out of the system. The reason our county gave are mentioned above. My husband who used to vote Republican was not purged from the system. This was in a deeply red state. I contacted the news and a reporter was very interested in it and began reporting that there were THOUSANDS of cases like this in my county. Then he went silent and stopped reporting on the voter purge. After that, I lost all faith in voting. "

"Its pretty crushing. Kid basically goes on a super epic flying tour of the whole world and where Santa lives and everything with a snowman that comes to life. He gets to hang out with all his snowman buddies and everything. Then the snowman drops him off home and waves him goodbye. The next day the kid goes out to see the snowman again but he's melted :( 

It's somehow even more moving because the movie has no dialogue at all. Just stunning hand drawn animation and some incredible music.

Even more stone cold about it is there's nothing after the kid walks out and sees the melted snowman. The only consolation you get is that he finds a scarf the snowman gave him in his pocket, so it's hinted that the adventure really happened. But it's like; kid goes outside, sees puddle, checks pocket, sad piano music starts, BAM. The end."

"my mother-in-law. 

TL;DR - she makes every situation about her


my wife and i have been together going on 12 years, married 4. 

ever since i met her mother, i've always been kind of turned off to her personality. she is loud, rude, lazy, and a hoarder. i always have put up with it though, as she is the mother of the woman i love. 
the are 2 main times when she really crossed the line. 

1. the birth of my son: my wife labored for 25 hours with our son and ended up delivering at 12:25am. she was exhausted, i was exhausted. i knew her older sister had been in the waiting room since about 9pm, so, before i even held my first born child, i wanted to let her know we had the baby. i got out to the waiting room, and her oldest sister and her mom were now there, along with her older sister. this kind of caught me off guard since i had no idea they were also there waiting. i announced we had a new little baby boy and told them i would let them know when we would be accepting visitors as we were going to spend an hour bonding with him ourselves. Well, her mom gathers her coat / purse and says 'she's my daughter, so im coming back too'. i, as politely as i could, replied 'i can let you know when we're ready for visitors'. 

at about this time, her mother and eldest sister got this look of disgust on their face, like, how dare i refuse their company, and stormed out of the hospital. her mom proceeded to call my wife and complain about how ignorant i was and should have allowed her back. her mother then refused to come up to the hospital to see our son the entire time we were there, and visited a week later. 


2. my wedding day. we had a very non-traditional wedding, but her mother wanted to be escorted down the 'isle'. we told her we arent escorting anyone down the isle and not doing a receiving line or anything like that. well, she proceeded to throw a bitch-fit the wedding day, refusing to smile in ANY of our pictures. after the ceremony, against our will, a receiving line formed with myself, my wife, her dad and my parents. we tried to get her to come over, but she refused stating we obviously planned this without her and didnt want her to be a part of it. 

she continued her hissy-fit of an attitude all evening. i was actually embarrassed for her. 


the worst part about all of this, is that she acts like none of this happened, and that she doesnt try and make everything about her. 

gets my blood boiling just typing this out.....

"How to clean glass pipes and the stuff only using a paperclip and lighter to get all the resin put and make the pipe look new. And the resin you can repack and smoke

Edit: for those of you wondering  

Take lighter and heat up your Glass pipe. I usually start on the bowl, move lighter back and forth over the whole outside area of the bowl to heat it up. Will help extract the resin by making it stick together. 

Un fold paperclip to a straight (I like to keep one end still in its original bent angle for a handle) scrape the inside of the bowl through the carb hole on side. The paperclip can be bent to any angle to get every possible angle needed to clean pipe. The shaft is easier to get clean. 

While scraping hold the pipe up to a light source so you can easily see through the pipe and see everything. See what you scraped and what's still there. If needed re heat pipe back up and keep scraping. I usually use a glass plate but anything to caught the resin will so. Just dump the resin out of the carb hole onto plate and repeat. 

You will be surprised how much resin you can get out of pipe. Even smoking just a few grams will leave a full bowl worth of resin or more. Have fun with new knowledge 

I taught myself this from not always having smoke and wanted to smoke. Hell one time I scraped my pipe and had so much resin left over that after I smoked all my resin the next day I scraped it again and got another full bowl worth of resin from the previous resin to get high on"

"Lying in bed, trying to fall asleep. Started hearing heavy breathing. Wtf. I hold my breath to make sure it's not my own echoing in my bedroom, but it continues. Get up, turn on the lamp, sound stops. Ooookay. Lie back down and try to sleep, sound starts again. It's definitely human breathing, and I don't have pets. I get up to check the windows aren't cracked, press my ear to the wall, the floor cracks, check my closet, open my bedroom door to make sure the sound isn't coming from the rest of the apartment. Back to bed. Still heavy breathing. Someone is close and breathing like they're trying to be quiet.


Oh fuck. Someone is under my bed. I checked everywhere else but there because that's fucking crazy right? 

Squat down and peek. 


Nothing.

Lie down in bed and listen to the breathing. I pick up my phone and scroll down to my parents' number, because it's becoming evident I'm actually having a psychotic break and hallucinating a presence in my bedroom. 


And then I have the bright idea to check my pulse. And the breathing matches it perfectly. I'm hearing my own pulse coursing through me. Not the way you sometimes do after exercise, but something must've been fucky with my blood pressure because it sounded exactly like heavy breathing. I've never experienced it since.


I don't believe in ghosts, so I never entertained that idea, but fearing first that there was *someone in my apartment*, and then being absolutely certain I was having a psychotic break (I have clinical depression so it wasn't that far fetched) were one of the scaries moments in my entire life."
"After that ending, I feel like the series could have been explained to his kids in under 5 minutes, especially since it's stated in one episode that they know ""That thing with their mother's umbrella...."", but talks about how he needs to go on and tell them the full story. Then tells them on the first episode ""I fell in love with your aunt"", and the show was ruined pretty early for me as I figured there is only one reason a father would sit both his kids down and talk to them like this, that is if their mother passed away. 

TBH, I stuck around for Marshall and Barney, the Barney stuff was actually reallllly good throughout literally the entire series, especially the end, he has the best ending by far, perfect month, baby, and then he focuses on being a real parent.

"This doesn't technically count, as I was technically still in college, but only barely.  I ended my 4th year of college with 9 credits left to take to finish my degree.  Because of the way my program was set up (Journalism and Mass Communication), I had to take two 3 credit classes in the Fall and then the final 3 credit class in the Spring.  This meant I was barely going to school and had a ton of free time.  I was working as a delivery driver at Jimmy Johns, and I ended up taking as many shifts as possible, working 30 to 40 hours a week.  I was averaging $15 - $17/hr, and my shifts were either 11 am to 5 pm, or 5 pm to 4 am.  This meant that I had a lot of disposable income for a 22 year old, good hours for being able to work and party every night, and barely any school.  It was the perfect combination of a high level of income and zero responsibility.  All in all, it was an amazing year of my life."

"I don't know if this counts as trashy or just really sad:

Camping at a KOA in a little one room cabin. We're sitting out on the porch and a woman and her kid (about 7-10 years old) pull up to the next cabin. The kid is all excited to camp and they discuss going to watch the movie later and generally they're having a great time. They go inside and we can hear the kid chatting having fun playing with his toys or whatever. 

An hour or so later, about 6pm, it's time for the movie to start. There was some mother son arguing but nothing out of the ordinary. They open the door and start to come out. The kid is being kind of whiny and acting up and starts yelling, ""Come on! We're gunna miss the movie!"" She just sits on the porch quietly and doesn't move, ignoring him. He tries pulling and pushing her trying to get her to do what he wants.

We think, ""Oooh. Passive resistance to this little shit. ok! I like that."" He continues to throw a fit and eventually she replies, ""Hold on just a minute,"" drops trou and pees right there on the front porch. At this point we realize that this is not a parenting technique. 

The kid keeps trying to pull her to her feet, crying and yelling things like, ""This never happens with dad!"" Finally this little kid looks up at the sky and cries, ""I can't live like this!"" which is when we decide to go inform the employees that this woman is fall-down drunk, making a scene, and could be endangering her child. 

The employees come and confiscated 5 or 6 **big** bottles of liquor, about half of them completely empty, and her car keys, telling us she will be ejected tomorrow once she's deemed sober enough to drive. 

Off they drove the next morning in her car which had adds for a tutor center all over it.

I like this story regardless.
"I work at an Estate Agents in the UK, although not in the sales or lettings department. 

One day a man stood outside the front door beckoning our staff over but not entering the building. When someone opened the door he explained that he was radioactive and that if he touched the door handle then we would more than likely contract cancer from using the handle in the future.

He then sat with our staff to book a viewing of a property to let, making several off jokes about being alone with our (all female) lettings personnel.
Lastly, he gave his name as Mr Herring. For info, Mr Kipper was the name given when Susie Lamplugh was abducted during a viewing of a property. Further, our office is within 10 miles of where she is suspected to have been buried.

Obviously, none of the staff in our lettings or sales department wanted to show this man around any properties, but we felt we had to. I volunteered as the largest person in the office, but we agreed that I would send text messages to my colleagues every ten minutes so they knew I was okay.

He turned out to be a very nice, socially awkward man with a mental issue that he was fully aware put others on edge and an unfortunate name that he was not aware rang alarm bells.

"I used to be active on this travel writing forum... some guy posted a story in which he was traveling in Ethiopia and argued with a local bus driver because there wasn't a student bus fare. He then presented his case to some local stranger he was seated next to. It blew my mind that anyone could sit down next to an Ethiopian farmer and say ""because I have enough money to both travel and attend university, I should pay a lower bus fare than you do in your own country, where you may never be able to do either of those things.""

Even though she's taking more of a risk every time she puts her baby in the car she takes the fact that some people are allergic or two weak as a sign that all the anti-vax propaganda is true. "

My senior Math teacher was a newlywed who moved to a small town. Her and I got along really well. I finished school and moved to the city about 3 months later I met her in a grocery store and asked if she was here on break. Not really. She had divorced her husband. We started talking and it turns out she was isolated in our small town where she knew no one. She moved and still didn't have a lot of friends. It had built up and finally she left him. Our conversation was really good. It seemed like she needed to get it out. So we went for coffee. Then back to her place. YADA-YADA-YADA  I banged my math teacher.

"One thing I've noticed: the resentment builds because one spouse doesn't want to work, but still wants to split household chores/taking care of the kids. 

Try making it clear that, as long as he's unemployed, he has to be the one cooking, cleaning and taking care of little ones (if there are any) *even when you're home*. 

While my wife was unemployed for awhile, we actually mapped out how much time a week she'd spend on chores (because it was the subject of a few arguments about me not ""pulling my share""). It turned out that with cooking, cleaning and applying for jobs, she was working around 40 hours a week - exactly the same as I was working at my job (back when I was retail, before I got my degree and became salaried). 

Things actually got so much better for us once everything was in the open. When she went back to work (part-time), we shifted some of the chores back onto me to keep it even.

I even venture into genres that orignially i felt really conflicted about, me being a feminist and all. It doesn't help that although lots of porn stars are doing what they love, many of the clips and vids are of girls who maaaaayyybe didn't fully consent to some of the stuff they did. i.e. surprise anal, coerced into any number of things while on set. And I always find myself comparing my body in the mirror with what I've seen and have this really distorted ""could i be in a scene?"" judgement of how hot i am to a porn actress.

"This is tangentially related to the topic.

Growing up I knew two girls who were having sex with guys in their 30s. It wasn't that big of a deal back then, but looking back it is so fucked up.

Both of the guys were friends of the family. One of them Debbie I was used as the cover so she could see her ""boyfriend"". The set up was, I was taking Debbie out on a date and I would pick her up at her house and drive to a spot near her house. Debbie and I would then make out until her ""boyfriend"" would come get her. At the end the night the same ritual was repeated we me taking her home, except often Debbie and I would have sex.  She had really huge tits so as a horny high school kid I loved it. It is so fucked up when I think about it now. I know he fucked her on more than a few times because on those nights Debbie would stop me before we had sex because she and he had. 

The second one I played no part in. I had a really tight group of friends that I hung out with in high school and there were a number of other people that were in our circle. 

Three of which were a couple, Chris and Tracy. They were one of those couples that were together for all of high school and Tracy's best friend Shannon. The four of us were hanging out one day after school, doing bong hits as everyone we knew did that. A conversation about dating came up and I asked Shannon, how come you aren't dating anyone. She was gorgeous, was fun and it made no sense she didn't have a boyfriend. 

Tracy pulls me aside and tells me about how Shannon is ""dating"" a 35 year old who is friends with the family.

Well cut to 20 years after high school and I reconnect with a lot of my high school friends via Facebook. Shannon is married to a guy who is at least 20 years older than she and they have four kids.  I can only assume that is the same guy from our high school years.

We were having a huge horrible argument about how things were playing out and he said some really awful things to me.  Needless to say I was extremely pissed and was basically having an existential crisis about our relationship.  The next day I was at work and really feeling like this might be the straw that breaks the camels back after many years of being together and working through A LOT of difficult relationship problems.  So I'm at work and my husband sends me a text with an attachment to some article about relationships and working things out etc. I just melted because it made me feel like we were on the same page and still a team.  It was his way of apologizing and reminding me he wanted to work things out.

"I'm sorry, but that's a gross oversimplification. Quite frankly it really doesn't matter when the other commonwealth countries joined the war, more the state of their economies following the war.

You go on to produce a counter-point to your very own initial argument, such as the introduction of Medibank (now Medicare) in Australia during the 1970's, clearly indicating that Australia didn't have the economic problems that persisted throughout Europe during the aftermath of WWII that would require public healthcare. I'd say that Canada's introduction of public healthcare in 1961 is already pretty far removed from the end of WWII as well.

There has to be more to it than simply economic state of the countries following WWII, there's no doubt it's a factor, and it's illustrated by Australia and Canada, but they eventually implemented them, what we are seeing today is continued dragging of feet by policy makers and citizens based on far more complicated socioeconomic factors."

"**Day 01:** Our subject - Dan, let's call him - voices a reluctant intention to get his first-ever job. Dan is nineteen at this point, and in college with an undeclared major.

**Day 04:** Dan submits his first-ever job application.

**Day 05:** Feeling smug about his ""accomplishment,"" Dan shows off a copy of the job application to a few people (including me). It is riddled with typos, snarky jokes, and outright criticisms. Everyone predicts that Dan will not hear back from the hiring manager. Dan sneers and declares, ""Nobody cares about that shit.""

**Day 11:** After receiving pressure from his parents, Dan enlists the help of an editor – me – in preparing his third-ever job application. I tell him that the job in question will require him to ""care about that shit,"" seeing as it's focused on data-entry.

**Day 12:** Dan is offered an interview.

"While this is mentioned I actually want to talk about this.

So I have a foot fetish (for womens feet), love em, always have been since I was like 10.

Thing is ""Foot Fetish"" is incredibly broad and that means not all foot fetishists(?) agree on a lot of things. (Size, toe shape, race, gender, toe color, skin color, etc)

Things as a guy with a foot fetish that I dont understand. - 

Dirty feet - Soles completely black from dirt and grime. I see lots of guys comment on how they want to lick the dirt off feet or the bottom of their boot (bdsm fetish maybe?)

Smelly Feet - Especially when described as ""Cheesy"" or ""Vinegary"" then go on to tell me how dirty smell and stinky they are.

Sweaty Feet - Mostly described with the former post, but usually has ""Hot sweaty boots"" tagged onto it for extra stink.

Food Crushing - Crushing pumpkins, Cake, fruit, chocolate, why?

Giantess fetish - Maybe this ones its own fetish, being stomped on or smothered under a giant womens feet, I know some guys have mouth/lip fetishes and want to be eaten/swallowed.

I like feet, but I like *clean* feet. Yeah I know theyre feet, they get sweaty, they can stink, they get dirty, but the human body is like that, its why we bathe. We can be clean and hygenic, theres people that eat ass in this thread.

Yeah Ill lick soles and suck toes, but theyve gotta be at a certain hygene standard that I see a lot of foot fetish people disregard and Ive always felt like a bit of a minority in this fetish despite how overbearing and meaningful it is in my sexual attraction to a person."

"It's probably too late, but I am a recovering heroin addict.  Two things happened while using.  One, a month or two before I got clean I had just copped 2 bundles and stopped at a gas station on the way back to throw a couple bucks in.  When I was walking in a cop pulled in and parked but didn't get out.  When I walked back out and started pumping 1-2 more cops rolled up and just sat there.  I wasted as much time as I could but they wouldn't budge.  Finally I said Fuck it and got in and started driving.  They INSTANTLY flipped on their blues and got behind me in the parking lot.  

I was like, welp, I'm fucked.  He came up and asked for license, registration, and proof on insurance.  The only thing I had was my license as all the others were expired because heroin.   I was like ""I have my license but I don't have-"" and he cut me off and said ""insurance or registration?  yeah, we know, we've been looking for you for awhile.""  which was super confusing.  I was just waiting for them to pull some shady shit like call the K9 or something if I refused to comply with a search.  They never did though.  My car was towed and I was stranded in mid January in the PA winter.  I called my buddy and told him I would throw him a bag if he picked me up.  He obliged. 

The second one happened THE DAY AFTER I got clean.  So I broke down to my mom and she helped me get help by going to a suboxone doctor (this is all another story), but what I found out is the day I went to my sub doctor, the day after I last copped, all my friends I used to cop with on the regular got stung.  

We all used to meet up at my friends house and drive to the local walmart or mcdonalds and the dealer used to meet us there.  Sounds normal, right?  Well, it was always like 8-10 of us junkies just taking up parking spaces waiting for the dope man.  turns out the day I didn't go is the day the police swarmed all the cars after the dealer got there.  All my friends went to jail/prison and my dealer got 25 years as he was caught with a gun and 400 bags, second offense.  

I feel like I dodged a bullet in both of those situations, let alone not using anymore.  6 years clean September 26th"

I lived in Colorado for seven, cold, bug-free, blissful years. Football, while a thing, wasn't huge. I never saw a college team advertised, I never saw crazy fans screaming at bar TVs, I never saw the chaos that would ensue upon moving to... *Razorback country.*

Arkansas has no NFL, NBA, or anything of the sort. What it **does** have is multiple stores dedicated to just one college team which has a cult-like following.

"I worked in a Burger King. At 20 I was the oldest person on my shift. A customer came to me to complain and demanded to speak to the manager. 

I went and got our shift manager Ross. Only 19 but he was experienced, smart and worked as an on call firefighter at the same time. As fast food managers go, he was a really good one. He was handling the customers complaint really well, was polite, but was refusing to give the customer their whole meal for free just because a single topping was wrong on one burger. Eventually the man snapped and shouted ""I'm fed up speaking to children I am getting no where! There must be another manager in this place I want to speak to a fucking adult"" 

Ross paused for a moment then said politely ""I can get the duty manager if you want, but he's my little brother...""

"I *almost* went on a date with this type of nightmare person, a guy I met on tinder. He seemed funny, smart, kind of a disaffected writer-type vibe going. He pushed to make plans to meet for dinner, so we set a date for the following weekend. 

I started having second thoughts almost immediately -- there was just something off about him that became more noticeable every time we interacted. He was extremely distrustful of women, claiming most of the ones online were prostitutes or scammers or otherwise lying about their true identities. His failed writing career was the fault of everyone else but him. He wanted my address so he could pick me up, but I wanted to meet at the restaurant instead. The day we were supposed to meet for dinner, I finally decided to listen to my instincts and texted to say I was sorry to cancel, but that I wasn't really feeling it. 

He went ballistic. Called my phone seven times, I didn't pick up. Left a voicemail, saying he didn't accept my cancellation, that he'd be there at the restaurant at the time we'd planned, and that he trusted I had the class and decency to show up as well. When I didn't show, he sent a long string of texts calling me a lying cunt, that I'd die bitter and alone. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I'd given him my home address when he asked for it. "

"I used to be a manager for a female clothing store at the mall (I'm a guy). Because of our inexpensive price points, our store policy did not provide any refunds for purchases aside from exchanges and store credits. So we were always having customer issues when they would try to return something. Working there for so long you become numb to customers yelling at you and creating scenes. Hell sometimes it's hard to keep yourself from laughing when they escalate to yelling over a $1.90 camisole. 
I had been there for three years and was very good at my job, one of the SM's and DM's favorites really. So I did whatever I wanted mostly with little repercussions. 
Well one day,  my cashier calls for ""customer service"" at the register. She has a customer wanting to return  some heels she bought claiming she just bought them yesterday (no receipt of course, which I'll normally just make exceptions if they'll just get something else because again , our store policy was terrible) but these heels look like they has come out of the trenches of WW1. They were pitch black at the bottom, scratched , and has a weird stain at the top. It was obvious she wore the crap out of then out in the club for the weekend and thought she could just return them. So I told her that we don't return any cash or original tender per store policy and that in particular anything that either way,  ""it must be unused, unworn and undamaged to be exchanged"" - her shoes were not checking any of those boxes. 
Then comes the whole "" I just tried them out at home and didn't like them..They were like that.. I want my money back.."", the usual. I kept telling her calmly and clearly that because her shoes were  used I couldn't do anything for her. Then of course, she went ahead an escalated the situation : 
Guest: No, you don't understand! You need to give me my money back! 
Me: I can't do that , the shoes are damaged. (Insert Store policy here) 
Repeat the above a few times and then she finally realized that I wasn't budging so she asked me if she could talk to a manager.i thought this was off at first, but  I then noticed that my tag was flipped towards my chest (we wore lanyards with the position we held  hanging on a tag) so you couldn't see my position. So I decide this was the perfect moment: 

Me: Mam..(flips over tag that clearly says ASSISTANT MANAGER) I AM the manager. 

My cashier cracks a smile trying to hold her laugh in, but clearly (my intent) the customer did not take this well. 

Guest: And why the hell are you smiling?! You think this isn't serious?! 
Me: Mam, you're not dealing with her, you and I are the ones trying to figure this out . 
Guest: You and I? You're a man, there's no way you can be a manager at a women's store. I want to talk to the real manager. 
Me: Mam, I am the only manager on duty here for the closing shift. 
Guest: No! No! You know what?! I want your name, her name (my cashier), and the corporate number! I'm reporting you both! 
Me: That's no problem [I write down my name, a fake name for my cashier, and our store number] here you go mam. Have a good rest your day. 
She then storms out . 
The next guest is finally able to get run up: 
Other guest: I just want you to know that you handled that amazingly well. (To my cashier) you have a fantastic manager. "

"I worked in a 911 call center for a while. I wasn't an operator but I worked with them every day. Anyway at lunch one day, an operator makes a reference to a call and everyone gets a little quiet. They notice I'm out of the loop and explain that many call centers have a collection of their calls that are just creepy, unexplainable, extraordinarily horrible, or famous in some way.

One of these calls involved a guy on the phone that had been fishing in our local reservoir before the sun came up (like 5:30 ish?) and had seen something fucked up in the water and it freaked him out. It was hard to hear what he was saying because he was running the engine full throttle and he was absolutely fucking terrified. There is a specific quality in a terrified person's voice and even over the phone or through a recording you get chills up your spine and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. 

He did not sound like a drug user having a bad trip. This dude was so fucking terrified and then BAM the phone hit the deck of the boat violently and there was no more engine noise. The man screamed very clearly that ""it got the motor"", then kept repeating ""oh god it got the motor"", then he started praying for his family. The phone sounded like it disconnected underwater. At the time I was at the center, the man had been missing for more than 5 years. 

Many rainless years later, the reservoir had completely dried up and someone found his boat -- and the motor was gone. Judging by the damage, the motor had been violently torn from the back of the boat. The best guess is that he had gotten spooked and ran full speed into a log or a submerged hill in the lake (there were buoys on most of the hills but they're hard to see at night). The resulting damage sunk his boat and he drowned. The problem is, the lake is fairly small and has active trails all around it. There is almost no chance his body would have gone unnoticed. "

Then he ends if by saying that they'll eventually get go her since they have to response to emergency situations first.

 She didn't emphasize that the dad could be dangerous, but I mean the fact that he needed a supervised visit with a social worker should be enough of an emphasis that he shouldn't be alone with the kids. 

Second call, after he's exploded the house, they almost immediately say they're sending a fire trunk, but then more of the stupid questions. At least the second one is just going it to keep her on the phone and get more info while she waits for the fire truck to show up.  "

Shit happens all the time, we're living in the age after WWII, and do you know what people said after WWI? ""This is the war to end all wars!"" Yeah, no.

I'm sure that in a hundred years, the map will look completely different.

Don't forget, there are still 5 countries that're communist, so you can expect them to collapse after some time. Nothing is constant, it just seems that way.

"This just reminded me of my own festival bathroom story. I went into a portapotty to pee but forgot to lock the door for some reason. So, I'm standing there, peeing, then 3/4 of the way through some girl opens the door and apologizes and closes it, while I'm still peeing because I can't just stop mid stream. Alright, whatever, I'm slightly embarrassed, and I turn to lock the door but can't find it right away and am almost done anyways, so I decide to finish up. Finally I do and get everything all tucked away, then as I'm about to walk out the door some other girl opens it and is shocked. At this point I am *mortified* and of course that means my brain has stopped functioning altogether, so all I can say to her is sorry while she's all like ""usually green means go..."" with a condescending expression like ""haha look at this idiot."" I can't think of literally anything else to say so I start backing away awkwardly while just repeating that I'm sorry over and over."

I helped her through the entire process - from security checkpoint to the gate, and made special arrangements with flight attendants to shepherd her along the way to a seat and guidance upon arrival.

She was *the sweetest lady* - a kind soul. I only wish that we had thought to exchange contact information to stay in touch because she made a lasting impression on me (as I once shared with redditors some time ago)."

"I was driving somewhere, I don't even remember where, but there was a guy in front of me who stopped at every traffic light, whether it was green or red. The street is just two lanes but there's a divider in between them so I couldn't pass him. The speed limit was 45, he was doing 30 at best, and would stop at green lights for about 10 seconds before going. When I got the chance to pass him, I didn't, because I wanted to see if he would continue (we had only gone through two lights so far). Went through 5 more lights like that. All green, very obviously, and he would crawl up to it at a snail's pace, wait 10 seconds, then ever so slowly drive through. I eventually passed him (he was in the left lane, because of course he was) and was surprised to see a healthy looking mid-20-something guy who wasn't texting or on the phone or a computer and looked for all the world like a normal driver. That was really weird.

It's like, turn on the part of the brain that lets you know the future, it automatically turns off the part that has free will. You can have one or the other, not both.

And to make it even more sad, in the short story her daughter doesn't die of childhood cancer, but from a hiking accident as a young adult. Something Louise totally could have prevented, if she were able. I fucking *love* this story, and it's so sad, but it's so perfectly constructed and thought out.

But no, the scriptwriters thought it was too much of a downer to say she had no more free will, so they made her able to change the future . . . kinda? Sorta? Maybe? Sometimes but not all the time?

I've done this didn't need an ambulance. But I had a fever and kept saying it'll go away...i can't afford the deductible.  After about two weeks I decided I would die without treatment or at least would prefer it.  At the hospital they wanted to do like a hundred tests from blood cultures to EKG etc. I was like WTF no I'm not paying for that give me antibiotics and let me leave (I was there like 6 hours).

Any little bit of neck movement made me dizzy and nauseous. The little bumps on the rode on the way to the hospital gave me a similar effect, dizziness and nausea. I was lucky to have had the viral kind of infection, which isn't deadly. The bacterial/fungal kind will most likely leave you with brain damage if you're lucky enough to live. "

"I worked at a popular thrift store for a few years, i'd been a customer for even more years and had always heard various stories that it was haunted.  Never saw anything in person, but at one point the entire staff was all up in arms over a piece of footage caught overnight.

I finally got one of the managers to show me the tape, and i must say - it was pretty damn odd.  The angle the camera was pointed showed a section of the front where the jewelry case was, as there'd been a number of smash n' grabs lately and they were hoping to catch the thieves.  Directly in the middle of the camera's view is an emergency door - and it's also worth noting that the entire front of the store is window glass - not solid walls.

So the footage shows this emergency door bowing outward towards the sidewalk as though a giant with enormous strength was trying to yank it open.  It was almost comical the way it was bowing outwards like a bubble or something.  But it was obviously violently shaking the window panes on all sides.  Through the glass - there's no one there.  It moves again and again and again, violently.  Either something was trying to get out, or something was trying to get in.  I tried to rationalize it away, because working there at the time i don't think i wanted to accept that something that strong was lurking around."

"A brief story:

Reading a Harry Potter book is what eventually made me achieve fluency in English. I was around 11 when I read the last book in the series, The Deathly Hallows, and I distinctly remember the day I started. 

I was sitting on my bedroom floor crying my heart out and my father (who's American, unlike myself) walked in and asked what was wrong. I pointed to the dictionaries open around me and to the book in question and told him I was so frustrated because I couldn't get past the first page. I was looking up every single word I didn't understand. 

My father just smiled, dried my tears and told me to just read. Enjoy that fantastic book for its story, that I'd manage to pick up the words as I went along. Only a little bit of word searching was actually needed. 

I was able to finish the book before part 1 of the last movie came out, as intended. My dad went to the movies with me and we saw it together. It was great. 

I can't begin to explain how much reading a book in the foreign language you're fighting to learn can help in actually tying your budding vocabulary  together past some grammar books. 

TL;DR: I considerably improved my English by reading Harry Potter.

"I'd heard about that story before a trip to LA, and thought 'hell no, I'm not staying in that hotel!', and went and booked somewhere else. I realised as I was standing in the foyer that they had changed their name and I'd accidentally booked it. Creepy as hell!"
I remember there was this episode of Gargoyles where for some reason Goliath had traveled into the future and one of the gargoyles had lost both his eyes in a battle.
"I used to work for an Eye Bank, where we would harvest eye tissue for surgical transplant, in Lubbock, Texas. This was about 13 years ago, and although I cannot remember the names and cannot find the details on the net anymore, I swear the following really happened.

Every once in a while, we would field calls for loved ones looking for some information about their loved ones organs, or the donor/recipient information. We never gave any of this info out unless a number of protocols were met, and despite my schooling and technical skill, this a large part of the job. Working with cadavers and folks who had just lost loved ones made the job as eerie as you might imagine.

One day I got a call that was stranger than usual. A woman called and asked if we keep records of the tissue that is donated. I replied that we do, and that our records were spot checked and verified by the FDA on an annual basis. She then asked if we have any record of a donor named (I can't remember the exact name, so let's call her...) ""Mary Smith"". I told her I couldn't give her that info unless she was to come to the office and deliver some evidence that she was related to MS. She proceeded to lower her voice and tell me 'if you have anything to do with this, you're going down like the rest of them...'

Whoa. WTF?

After that phone call, I reported the incident to my boss and my Executive Director. They got in touch with Legal and I was instructed to, if I ever heard from her again, not say a word and hang up. My boss also intimated that Legal had answered questions about this woman before.

I was spooked....and intrigued. I googled the woman's name and stepped right into an X-Files story. I don't remember every detail, but the Cliff's notes read as such:

The woman's mother had suffered some fate that landed her in the hospital. At a certain point, the doctors pronounced her deceased and she was sent to the funeral home. The funeral home put a body in the mother's casket. The daughter was absolutely adamant that the body in the casket was not her mother, but the body was eventually buried over her objections somehow. I remember that I read she kept petitioning the city to exhume the body to run tests, but she was shot down at every turn, which just confirmed to her that the body was not her mother.

I eventually stumbled onto a pretty detailed website that she set up (It was something like 'isthisright.com'), where she detailed a mountain of evidence - some of it pretty convincing - and laid out her theory that the hospital switched the body, the mother was still alive, and she had been collected by a government entity so that they could experiment on her with radiation.  The website was so detailed and so convincing that I couldn't automatically dismiss her claims.

I don't know what happened to that lady or her mother. The fact that I can't find any info kinda makes me think the daughter passed away. But I still think about that phone call sometimes. That woman called up accusing the hospital, the funeral home, the organ donation firm and us. She also called and harassed the head of the willed body donor program. All because she was sure the body in the casket wasn't her mom.

I hope that lady found peace. But I suspect she didn't/hasn't."

Fast forward to when I was halfway through high school, we had very bad forest fires in the Province I live in and they had to do a lot of firefighting techniques which involve digging up burnt areas to contain the fires. Well they unearthed a young man's body during that process, it was the bus driver's son and he had 1 or 2 bullets in his head. He'd been up there in the bush all along."
"I don't doubt you believe this, but you 'left' with your mentally ill mother when you were too young to know what was going on and likely grew up moving around a lot, in the care of someone struggling to cope and to make sense of her world.

"Not a boss, but I witnessed this between my boss and an employee.

15 years ago I worked at a grocery store. It was summer so we're all in shorts (crucial detail to the story).Other guy took a long bathroom break and we weren't keeping up. Boss was mad other dude disappeared so he had to help to pick up slack. Other guy finally came back and was walking in front of us heading for his vest.

A joint fell out of his pants and the boss immediately picked it up and started yelling at him for him, telling hit this is gonna get him fired. Other guy was confused as all hell, he doesn't even smoke weed and claimed it's not his. Boss said he saw it roll out his pants and made the mistake of putting it to his nose. It was a rolled up piece of standard issue,single ply TP that probably lodged in his ass when he was aggressively wiping and him walking dislodged it and it fell out his ass. Boss just said something in Russian, dropped it and dipped out. Kid was transferred to another store close by, I'm going to say it was related to that.

I run to them and he looks at me with this stupid ""what you gonna do, bitch"" face and starts saying things like: why the fuck would I care if his hurt.

And his mom comes behind the storage room (don't know what it is in English, the one outside that has sporting equipment stored into) and has the look that tells you this kid is in trouble. And this boy's attitude completely changed! He became this respectful and quiet kid, but too late, because mom had heard what he said to me. Long story short, he lost all access to social media and his mom did it again when she heard he acted like that. He really started behaving better "

&gt;Remember when J. Crew President Jenna Lyons appeared in a picture tickling her delighted son’s toes, whose nails she had just painted pink? It sparked a week’s worth of debates that saw actual doctors calling it “a dramatic example of the way that our culture is being encouraged to abandon all trappings of gender identity,” as if anything described as a  “trapping” should not obviously be abandoned immediately.

&gt;If gender neutral clothes are only made for and marketed to the parents of little girls, it is less a sign of gender equality and more an indication of the misogyny that is so ambient in our culture. There is such a devaluing of anything traditionally feminine that we’d rather chuck it out triumphantly than ever demean our boys with it."

"A good friend of mine went / is still going through this. Unfortunately, during the relationship they got a dog together. She let him keep it. I knew why she did, even if he didn't see it at the time. Regardless, he loved this dog so he took it. 2 years later, after many other incidents, she still messages him near daily asking to come see the dog. He finally got it into his head that she doesn't care about the dog, she's looking to wiggle her way back into his life. 

Crazy people / stalkers can ruin your life, and he narrowly escaped that exact situation after her setting him up and getting him put on probation 2 separate times, the last time he was almost charged with a felony until he remembered he had video of the incident on his phone which was the only saving factor. 

The point being, having been a first hand witness to this with someone very close to me in life, I can say I do know how this feels. However, I can understand how some people may not really be able to comprehend it if they have never seen or experienced it personally.

"So, I never thought this to be all that true but I had a conversation with some girls at work that made me sad but also was kind of eye opening.  As a disclaimer,  I'm no grand beauty but I don't give a lot of attention to my appearance.  I rarely wear makeup and my hair is either down or in a bun. I never spend much time doing anything special to get ready in the morning although I do dress well. 
We were in the lounge and I mentioned to these 2 coworkers that I always thought they looked very pretty and put together. Perfect hair, makeup, etc. They're both big girls but look very  nice. 
They responded that they had to do the whole hair/makeup thing because they're ""fat"" and if they didn't people assume they are slobs. The one said I didn't have to worry about stuff like that because I was pretty and ""thin""(I'm not thin but I'm not that large either). It made me really sad that they feel that way but I really appreciated their openness.  It gave me a new perspective because honestly I stayed away from them a little because to me they looked high maintenance. I didn't realize that they were doing it because they felt that they had to.

"I lost my virginity pretty late (23, am a woman) and I can totally relate to the pent up sex drive. In my case I was glad I just didn't sleep with a guy I didn't actually like solely to ""get it over with"". I pretty much wore my bf out everytime we met and I felt safe and comfortable with my sexuality.

I wasn't that reserved about sex to begin with but I saw my friends regretting their first time so I decided I'd wait until I met a guy I was eager to sleep with.

I'm not saying everyone should wait / people should have sex only when they're in a serious relationship, etc. By all means experiment if you're comfortable with it!

"I'm a dude in her position and day to day it doesn't bother me but I don't like it when she says things like you have commented here. I don't care about her previous partners but her mentioning the exact same things you have about it being nice that I've only been with her (she doesn't know about my 'unsuccessful attempts' haha) *makes* our/her history matter.

Your relationship history matters or it doesn't. It doesn't not matter for the one who has been with others but does matter in some 'positive' way for the person who hasn't. There's something very patronising about it, too. The 'pride' bit is kind of silly. She definitely wanted to have sex with other people before meeting you, she wasn't just bereft and sexless before you came along.

From the other side, my advice is keep this stuff to yourself. It matters for both of you or neither. Don't make it a 'thing', even by saying it's a thing you like.

I can't think of a response to it at all other than ""yeah, I hadn't had sex with anyone else before... but not for want of trying."" I wasn't 'waiting for the one' or some shit, I just had few opportunities and didn't 'rise to' them. Or, at worst, makes me want to say ""yeah, I'll always regret it actually. I would really love to sleep with a few more people."" Which is true. But neither response is good so what else is there to say?"

1) Gets up at 2AM in winters to go outside. Even if I've take her out at 11. She never has to pee either. Just sort of... stares? Thankfully she's stopped that. 

2) Not food motivated. At all. She'll take a treat if you give it to her, but won't work for one. She's pretty indifferent to food. Oddly fond of pistachios and will attempt to take them from me, though. 

3) Starts crying and howling if there's a storm. Thundercoat didn't work. She has her own hiding spot in the basement closet, but sometimes wants me to sit in there with her for 20 minutes to make sure it's okay. 

4) Very unaffectionate. She doesn't lick me or jump on me or do dog stuff. She does like hugs, though! She walks into my arms for a hug sometimes if she's sad. 

5) She sometimes just walks around barking for no reason. Doesn't want out, food, water or walk. Just wants to bark.

6) She doesn't play. I feel bad about this because I don't think she really learned as a puppy. When she was younger I did get her to play chase, though!

I love her and wouldn't trade her for anything, but man she is a real piece of work. It took YEARS to earn her trust and convince her that nobody was going to hit her or leave her.  Most people say she's like a cat. It's pretty accurate. Still won't chase a string, though. She's pretty docile and chill, all she needs is a good long walk every day and my bed to sleep in, and she's content."

Moreover to provide more context, the socialist parties back then were far more left leaning. They weren't afraid of nationalisation and implementing public services and we didn't have America coming over to our countries to dictate what we can do with our economy as we have today. 

I seriously doubt that the centre-right and the centre-left in any European country, today, would actually create such a socialist program if it didn't exit and pressure from the US and from big corporate entities would certainly be very against it.

So basically, we got lucky. Our politicians have thought about liberalizing/privatizing health care but the public service is now far too popular to get rid of."

"Made a new throwaway just for this (NSFW):

I worked for IT at a school newspaper my sophmore to senior years in college (I was manager). Part of my job was reviewing security cameras footage of who entered/exited the building and also what was going on in the building. Most days I never even checked since nothing ever happened, but one day I was looking through some footage after getting a notification that someone entered late the previous night. I found this girl, who was an employee that I knew fairly well, enter at about 11:45 PM. A bit unusual, I thought, but some people did work late into the night, it was still strange for her to show up, alone, that late. About 20 minutes later she opens the door for some guy, that I hadn't seen before, but apparently also worked there. These two straight up Netflix and chilled, without the Netflix, if you know what I mean, on the back couch in the editorial department (think Dwight/angela style). They didn't even seem to bother looking around for others and also didn't bother to notice the camera in the ceiling or even try to cover themselves/quiet the noises (and there were some). And let me tell you, she was a journalist and journalists are quite fine..

So where does this leave me? The next day I'm sitting on my computer watching two colleugues bone on my computer...needless to say...not my proudest fap. Didn't tell anyone, never talked to that girl again.."

We have never bought another, nobody ever gave us one. I was unpacking yesterday, found the second trashcan and since I knew one was in the bathroom, I asked my girlfriend where she wanted the one in the bedroom.

She looked at me weird and said, ""It's over by the hope chest"". So I hold up a trashcan and say, ""No, I'm holding it"". She insisted there's one in the bedroom and sure enough, there is one exactly like the other 2 in the room already. We have no explanation as to how we acquired a 3rd can. There were only ever 2, not there are 3. I don't think I'll ever get over it."

I was scared but didn't think I did anything wrong. Principal opened the note, read it, and then told me ""Mr. Brown says you are the most improved student in his class and one of the best students he has. Good work."" I almost cried in relief and I was genuinely moved by this teacher that seemed to be so hard on his students, saying something good about me. A nobody.

Last time I saw Mr Brown, he was yelling for our basketball team and seemed really into it and disappointed when we lost. I'll always remember him behind his desk being tough on his students and yelling during that game.

"I was a volunteer lifeguard at a middle school for part of the year. This school also has a swimming month in the gym classes, where students must wear bathing suits bought/ordered via financial aid at the uniform store. 

There was a highly overweight girl in one of the classes, and she didn't seem to be aware of the standard issue bathing suits. The gym teacher sent home reminders the week before, but I guess she forgot. This girl was picked on a lot in general, and always kept to herself. She was very shy.  She never spoke. If you called on her to answer a question in front of the class she would get teary. On the first day, the other students showed up wearing the uniform bathing suits, but she was wearing her bathing suit from home. It also wasn't a particularly pretty bathing suit, as it looked very old ladyish and had a bright orange Hawaiian shirt-type of pattern. She stuck out,  which you could see in her body language really bothered her. 

The gym teacher ended up calling her out in front of the whole class, giving her a lecture, and giving her a detention for not wearing her uniform (because that was the rule). Her face turned bright red, and she just stood there silently while other kids stared at her and giggled. You could tell that she wanted to cry, and that her soul had just crumbled. The lecture went on for a very long time. This was a gym teacher who didn't like it when students disobeyed the rules. 

I was sitting off to the side, wringing my hands and bouncing my knee in second-hand embarrassment. I wish she had just read the reminder. Poor sweet child. Always read the reminders. "

"German school system in a nutshell: 

Elementary school: age 5/6 to 9/10; grade 1-4, everybody together 

After that you have three ""options"", based on your grades in the last year of elementary school. 
A) Hauptschule: 9 years total, so 5 more years of School after elementary. You'll be a hairdresser, construction worker or mechanic. You can continue on to Realschule after graduating Hauptschule if your grades are good enough.

B) Realschule. 10 years total. You'll be a sectretary, nurse or store manager. You can continue on after graduating Realschule if your grades are good enough to a different school and reach university level education. 

C) Gymnasium. 12 years total (hopefully 13 again soon). You'll be a lawyer, doctor, architect or judge.

You can always continue on and there are more schools like FOS and BOS but they're not that relevant for my explanation. 


The problem with our school system is that you'll pass if you're a monkey that can climb trees. If you're a super smart fish you'll fail cause you can't climb trees. It's too general too much goddamn useless information and not enough specialization. I'm a copywriter. I knew I was gonna do something language after 4th grade. Why did I need to take physics and chemistry classes until grade 12 or 10? Anyway, I'm ranting. 

Edit: the professions were examples of what you can do with that education. Obviously not everybody will be one of the jobs listed, but you /can/ if you want to. "

"I'm joining the military and will hopefully pass basic (I've already lost a fair bit of weight and am working construction which is helping with weight lifting) and the biggest thing I fear is that weird community surrounding ""being in the military/whatever."" I have some friends that are currently serving and the ones I cut contact with were just turning their social media into pissing contests of who will be the most patriotic, who's making the military the biggest part of their lives, etc.

There's just so many weird toxic aspects around the military. Being in it seems to be a pissing contest amongst enlisted. Partners or spouses of military members is a contest about who's the best Army/Navy/AF/Marines wife and who can sacrifice the most. It's just... weird to view from the outside. 

My younger brother just graduated from Marine Corps basic training and told me I might be interested in a program they have. So that's what I'm planning on right now. I just hope I can avoid those aspects."

"Funnily enough, Little Red Riding Hood is the only 'vore' story I read where I didn't feel any arousal.  I read it when I was very little, and when I reached the part where the wolf eats her I was so terrified that I put it down and refused to read the ending.  I didn't even know she got rescued in the end until much later, when I saw a cartoon adaptation.

They say some fetishes are caused by old traumatic memories from childhood being re-wired later on, so maybe that story was actually the catalyst.  Which is ironic, considering how many nightmares it gave me."

"I experienced the opposite of this story. Two male teachers I had in high school paid special attention to me of their own volition because they noticed something amiss (Narcissistic abuse at home, fyr) and because of them, not only did I graduate high school, but I didn't kill myself. I think of them like some folks think of their dads. Other students would make comments insinuating they were being inappropriate with me, and I got into several physical altercations (that I won) on a few occasions because of them.

"For my tenth birthday my aunt bought me a couple lego sets for my birthday, one of which had a disc with some sort of movie maker program so you could make videos with the lego set or something. Anyways, my family didn't have a computer because we were relatively poor at the time, so when I opened up the last present I made a joke that I hoped it was a laptop because I wanted to use the program. 
Now, I said this with good intentions, I wasn't trying to be mean, because obviously the next gift wasn't a laptop (it was a book, which I thoroughly enjoyed btw), but my aunt took it to mean that I didn't like my other presents and she was very visibly upset by this. But I didn't find out until later that it had actually made her cry. 
I apologized to her the next day, and told her how I meant for it to sound and that I was deeply sorry. Even though this happened almost 15 years ago it still to this day makes me feel so painfully guilty"

As someone who WAS a moderate hard drug user, has family and friends that have suffered and died from ""hard drugs"" and IS a chemist, I truly believe the best outcome is more somewhere in the middle.

I believe that access to objective (trustworthy sources) and proper regulation is the best possible outcome.  I grew up in the 80's and 90's and the tone deaf attitudes by the US government were, in my opinion, useless and counterproductive.

"Hello, even if no one reads this, venting is nice.

Every single time I become proud or confident in who I grew up to be, that crumbles down quickly. Suddenly, I feel ugly and dumb. I feel like I'm not the person I think I am. The good friend or the moral citizen or the hardworking student. 

I have friends but I can't bring myself to complain to them. Some are judgmental, others are busy with their own lives. I want to tell someone how tired I am but who would listen to me if everyone has their own issues? I doubt anyone cares about me that much to put me first. And I don't want anyone to hate me, so I won't bother anyone.

But what I want to say is, I'm scared of the future. I don't think I can make it out smoothly. I'm terrified of failing, because I don't know how to get back up. I hate that I didn't and don't work harder. I have so much I want to do, but why do I decide to be so lazy? I've participated in so many arguments and fights recently, maybe I'm just a horrible person. I just want to be able to help others, but how can I do that when I'm drowning myself? Maybe I'll even end up pulling them down with me.

My worst fear is to be hated. I curl up in my shell when I realize someone might dislike me. But then I realize that I also hate myself. Which is probably why I can't bring myself to have friends. How can I like someone, who likes something I hate?

Hopefully, everyone else can find their way. Good luck, I wish you all the best."

"My husband and I were struggling financially due to unexpected expenses. My oldest daughter was engaged and said it was ""tradition"" for the bride's parents to pay for the wedding. (When my husband and I married, we paid for it ourselves and kept it small and intimate) Knowing we couldn't afford a big elaborate wedding, we assumed she meant something reasonable. 

Well, that was a huge NOPE. She and her fiance decided to wait a year, so we could ""save up"" for the wedding they wanted. We did what we could, but it wasn't enough. Now, 8 years later, we still hear about the sacrifice they made by waiting. Both are in their 30's and are struggling due to health issues. We help when we can, and we have a good relationship with her, but we periodically hear about the disappointment over their wedding. (Also, our Daughter has her Masters Degree and we're still paying on student loans for her) 

Edit: For those who are blaming us, yes we were disappointed in their attitude toward their wedding. The reason we help them now is due to their health issues. (He was born with Cystic Fibrosis and had a double lung transplant. She has a rare immunity deficiency disease that developed a couple of years ago, and has to have weekly infusions to stay alive. He works , she is unable to at this time) Our daughter and her siblings were not spoiled as children. Our daughter just had unrealistic expectations of what we could do for her wedding. "

"Sometimes, I wish that were more true.

Nobody caring is a positive thing. It means they leave you alone and let you handle things. The opposite is micro-management, or a boss who cares to the point they prevent you from doing work simply by attempting to make sure you *are* doing work. The counterproductive nature of micromanagement never stops them.

You know what is a prime sign of having a real, adult, professional career? Freedom to do the work. Getting assigned things to do and being left alone to do them. Anything where you constantly have to check in and report back and let everyone know exactly what you just did is piddly Mickey Mouse bullshit which isn't a career, it's a job, and learning the difference between a career and a job is a very important skill."

"I'm late here, when I was a kid, my sister's friend was abducted and murdered. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but she was missing for weeks. We had police searching our house for this girl day and night, because her last known motion was on her way to our house. Turns out a family friend / someone they just sold a car to is the one that killed her. I remember there were rumors started that she was home safe and she never was, rumors that she was found dead in a popular heavily wooded part of town, which turned out to be false.. this was post-9/11 when cell phone interceptions were big amongst police force. Say what you want about it being a violation of the constitution, the only way they caught the killer was a cop picking up someone driving on their cell phone asking how far do they have to dig a hole so animals don't dig the body up.

"My parents used to go nuts at me for leaving doors ajar around the house. I'd walk into the living room and pull the door behind me, but not shut it completely. ""Shut that door - you're letting all the heat out!"" It annoyed me no end having to constantly re-trace my steps, closing all the doors behind me so they latched. I couldn't see why they were so bothered about it.

Now I live alone in a flat that isn't all that well insulated. There are times in winter when I have to close off all the doors and shut off the radiators in the bathroom and the other bedroom in order to be able to keep my bedroom and the living room warm enough to live in without wearing a winter coat and shoes. It's too expensive to run the heat for the whole flat all winter, so I just have to jam towels along the bottom of the doors I'm not using or with the worst drafts and make the best of it.

In the depths of winter, I have to switch to just living in my bedroom. Leaving the door open for longer than it takes to walk through it is expensive. I'd go nuts if I had some kid wandering around just letting the place slowly dip back down to being 10c degrees again (50F)

Of course, the fact that my parents keep their house so hot these days that I can't sleep there with the window closed even in winter isn't at *all* annoying, given how much shit they gave me for wasting money and heat as a kid..."

"I am in my early 30s, and few things i can guarantee for sure,

    Get an education. Period.

    Read, read, read. Books can be your mentor. You get to have a sneak peak inside the author's mind.

    Exercise. A healthy body is your gift to yourself in the long run

    Relationships may or may not work. People grow up and at times grow apart. Be honest, as truth is always a far kinder alternative.

    Learn the art of storytelling. This will help you to form bonds with people. Present your views in an articulate way. Friends, family, strangers, colleagues, will need to see your story from your perspective, (and you don't need to raise your voice or get into arguments to get your points across )

    Learn to try things out of your comfort zone. As you grow older, you are restricted by age, health and million other things.

    Avoid people who bring you down.

    Be kind and respectful to people.

    Lastly, you can never undo your past. You will make mistakes, and you should make efforts to learn from it. Learn to forgive and let go. Regrets suck the life out of you.

"Yeah it makes no sense. The kids who are skipping class are going to be looking for an actual reason to not come, and a suspension is perfect. They aren’t allowed to come.

A related thing; I had a teacher who had a kind of excessive no phone policy. If your phone simply went off in your pocket, just a short text tone even, he would STOP CLASS, and search and take minutes of questioning to find out who’s phone it was, then make them get up in front of the whole class and drop their phone in the phone bin at the front of the room.

This whole process would consume several minutes of precious class time, where a more reasonable thing to do would just to tell you to shut it off and let you quietly do so and continue with class, but no."

"Our assistant football coach was fresh out of college after playing linebacker at a small fbs school. He would always be very chummy with us, inviting us to hang out at his apartment and picking fights with certain players in practice. He taught junior or senior English and the yearbook class. Would always flirt with the girls in class. Was determined on being the 20-something year old badass the guys looked up to, while reading poetry and acting all intellectual in English class to impress the girls.

He slept with a girl a year younger than me, at a graduation party I think, full of all his graduating students. Gross, but legal. It was least the one girl, I can’t recall if there was a second one later. Nothing came of it. BUT... He took a head coaching job a few years later at a big high school and lost the job when he got busted for having a sexual relationship with a student. Police got a tip so they bugged one of their phones, got a phone conversation of him being pretty predatory. He pleaded guilty, and last I heard he had gotten out of jail and was working as a bouncer in my hometown, back where it all started."
"Agreed.  A simple tomato sauce is incredibly easy to make, and a great weapon in any home chef's arsenal.  Prep takes less than 5 minutes and it's vastly superior to a jar:

- Chop a yellow onion, saute in some olive oil til soft
- Chop a couple garlic cloves, throw them in and cook for a minute or two.  Kitchen will smell amazing at this point.
- Add a can or two of tomatoes (crushed for a smooth sauce, or diced for a chunky sauce), plus salt, pepper, dried italian herbs of choice, and some pepper flakes if you're feeling spicy. 
- Simmer for 15 minutes

That's it.  You'll never go back to jarred sauce.

A couple of bonus tricks if you're feeling extra ~~motivated~~ saucy: 

* If you're simmering the sauce for less than 30 minutes, consider adding a tbsp of white sugar with the tomatoes, to enhance the sweetness and balance the acidity.  Tomatoes will naturally release plenty sweetness if you're cooking it for 30+ minutes
* My secret weapon is a dash of cinnamon powder, for some extra depth of flavor.
* If you really want a richer, deeper sauce, add a tbsp or two of tomato paste after you saute the vegetables, and let it get nice and brown before you add the canned tomatoes.  You can deglaze the brown bits from the bottom of the pan by adding a splash of red wine and scraping.  Those brown bits will give a ton of extra flavor and boost the sauce to the next level.

"I think it's even more disturbing because he had known you since you were 13. I've heard someone say that it's not about whether the younger person says yes when it comes to relationships between teenagers/barely adults and way older men/women, it's still the responsibility of the older person to say no, and I generally agree.

I definitely see why you lost respect for him, even though I also see and agree that he's not some kind of predator. I just think it's telling of someone's character to pursue sexual relationships with younger people and not give a thought to how it might affect them, or not think of the reasons why they're interested in someone older in the first place.

Edit: Also forgot that he was your teacher, which makes it worse because somehow when I made this reply, I kind of got it in my head that he was an older buddy that was interested in music, and not actually your teacher."

He turned 10 two weeks ago.

He sat in the bathroom screaming for 5 hours, tired out, wiped, and came out.

Sometimes, with higher functioning kids, it's really just the parents.


I had another case with a kid who knew when he had to poop, but refused to use the toilet. He would literally stand up, go grab a diaper, then sit in it till he pooped, then call for his dad. He was 13.5 when he finally stopped.

We tried for a year to get the parents to stop letting him use diapers. One day, for some reason his dad just had enough and listened to us, threw out all the diapers. The kid didn't poop for 3 days, then caved and used the toilet. He's 15 and they still clean him/shower him for fear he'll regress; I think it's fear of tantrums.

Parents can be the greatest challenge to some kids."

"My online history class taught me the story of operation mincemeat.   
In 1943, the British found a dead man's body, loaded it with fake documents, and tossed him off where they thought he would be found. The documents he carried suggested he was a general, delivering plans to invade Greece, a Nazi controlled territory at the time. When Germany found the body, they fell for the bait. They took all of their best weapons to Greece and they were ready for an invasion. This left Britain's real target, Sicily, vulnerable. It was an easy win for Britain.

"I asked myself the same question. I think he was one of the higher ups at his company, or he didn't mind putting himself into debt to fund his constant gambling. We don't see him anymore so that's a good thing, but I think that was because he got banned for abusing staff.


My (now former) stepfather was a truck driver who earned really good money back when he did that before he and my mother split up. He was higher up in the ranks too and had been working there for a couple of decades maybe longer. I had no idea how much he earned until after they broke up, but he was getting around $500k at some point apparently. Yet we always had to budget everything because he too gambled (and drank) most of what he earned. Fucking ridiculous!"

"34F, never even been kissed. I can count on one hand the number of dates I've been on. It doesn't really affect me. I have a great job, great friends, I travel a lot.

When I was a teenager, all through high school and most of college, I was pretty relentlessly bullied. I was told on a regular basis that I was ugly and that no guy would want to sleep with me. THAT affected me. Took several years to get beyond that.

As a kid, I always imagined that I would get married and have kids. I've had to let go of those dreams - life doesn't work according to a plan. 

It's been something like 12 years since I've been on a date (or asked out on a date). I'm not sure if I WANT to date (my life is pretty good), but sometimes it would be nice to know that guys are interested in me.

My best friend is married, and I've noticed that there are certain aspects of her relationship that are strange to me. Some are logistic - it would be strange to always have to tell someone where I am or what I'm doing. Some are skills - I had to jump her car battery for her, because she never had to learn (hubby always did it). Some are just strange - I just can't imagine loving someone so much that you want to have a baby with them. Plus there's the financial side... anytime she tells me about how her husband refuses to budget for them to have a better phone or computer, I kinda want to slug him.

One thing that is definitely strange to me... my friend is maybe an 8 right now, but before she had kids she was definitely a 10. I see how much attention she gets from guys, and she tells me about how much MORE attention she got when she was younger. That's completely foreign. I don't think I've ever had a guy express that much interest in me."
"I used to work at a nameless children's pizza and arcade chain who's mascot was a giant dancing mouse. I had a coworker get fired ""for cussing at management"". I was friends with both him and the 2 managers so I was able to get both sides of the story. The managers told me that after he had clocked out for the day one of them asked him to go buss tables, he refused as he had already been allowed to clock out and they she told him to do it anyways so rightfully annoyed he said ""Well what the fuck else can I help you with?"". Now this does sound bad at first, except for the fact that we would all cuss at each other. I've had one of them tell me to do something and responded ""Fuck you bitch"" and they just laughed and I went and did it, so ""Cussing at Management"" is a bullshit excuse. From his side of the story which I had also seen happen to him first hand, they were very rude to him due to him being Autistic. He hand doctors notes as well as notes from his sponsor from a mental health support group he attended saying that he couldn't get into the mouse suit and do the dance because it could cause him to have a seizure. Knowing this they would schedule him to do the shows anyways and there was an argument about this almost every day. That and they used to take breaks to come and chat with me at my post by the door and complain to me about how they didn't think he was actually autistic and make other complaints about him going so far as to tell me not to chat with him and yelling at him for distracting me when he would pass by me and say hello. 
TLDR; Managers disliked my autistic coworker, couldn't fire him for being autistic, fired him for cussing which we all did including the managers."

My uncle then brought out mace from his pocket in his left hand and faked that he had a gun in a holster in his right hand and was threatening to shoot him. The man became scared and ran off.

The little guy is kind of an idiot savant... the first thing he did was figure out where the ball came out so as soon as it started making noise he'd just run to the front and put his mouth 2 inches from the hole and catch the ball. Ok, fine... Im not gonna tell you how to have fun. 
I got him to drop the ball in the hole on his own a couple times, but it wasn't going great. After a couple days all hope was lost... he somehow figured out that the sound meant a ball would come out and simultaneously discovered the trigger that the ball hit in the hole to start the machine. He completely lost interest in the ball and would just stick his snout in the hole to start the machine and then stand in front of it and bark because no ball came out."

"This is so true. I am glad I learned it rather early, but I have never ever given a second more than I should, I try to do my job the best I can, but I wake up from bed to return home and be with my family, as much as I like my job. I will give them my best, but I won't give them my life. I am 33, i have almost never stayed up late at work except maybe 4-5 days in like 11 years.

I have seen people giving out their lives to the job as if it was going to do anything for them. One of my workmates, has two small children, and was diagnosed with cancer and he has been already 4 months out. He is the super loyal kind of guy staying late when projects are having problems and working for 3 because he loves his job so much. Problems are always there. Fires won't stop. You can't save it, just do your job and go home. Nobody is going to truly give a shit about it. And I have been 10 years already working with him. I recall him missing some of the events of his kids because of work. Dude, he is an awesome man, but I never want to be that way. I talked with him about this hundreds of times, before he was diagnosed. Now it is a second hand lesson for me, but I am sure as hell it will never happen to me.

It is good to like your job, it is good to be professional and hard working, but don't become a slave, don't make your life a job. Specially if you have a family."

I wish we were more empathetic and understood better why poverty and crime are so closely related.

"A for effort, but D for execution. Here are some tips for next time you make up stories:

-Make it your friend, not the hospital. You're describing a HIPAA violation, and it's pretty unlikely that some rando at a hospital would be like ""Oh, lol, that girl you're describing has STDs"" unless you were lifelong bestest friends. At least specify that the ""third party"" was a fellow patient or something.

-Doctors don't usually call people at night. Rethink your timeline. Maybe you were hanging out with her at a movie or during the afternoon? The only way you're getting a call during your doctor's off-hours is if you've suddenly found out you have a very serious medical problem, in which case some party girl is probably not what you're talking about or thinking about. Going in at night also reduces the likelihood that the ""third party"" wasn't bound by HIPAA. So either go in the afternoon or drop the whole doctor storyline entirely. 

-Use different STDs. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are both curable with antibiotics, so if she'd been to the hospital recently for those two diseases, she doesn't have those anymore. Try herpes or HPV next time. If you want to get creative, go with syphilis if you want an old-timey feel to your story or HIV if you want to be super dramatic.

Best of luck with your stories, Internet stranger. "

"Yeah you are completely right.

Yes, at first sight it looks nice of the guy that he didn't abandon the children but I think some people are forgetting the scenario where he may have sabotaged a condom to get these children in the first place.

Sabotage.  
A.  
Condom.

That is messed up man. This is a guy who's willing to walk over bodies to get whatever the fuck it is he wants and completely disregards whether or not the other party is ok with whatever he wants to achieve.

That girl had no say in the matter and became a mom because he, and ONLY HE, decided that for her.          

I'm willing to bet my life on it some ugly things would have happened should the girl have decided to abort the child.

edit: adjusted the post a little because I worded it wrongly in a way that it made it seem as a fact that he actually did sabotage the condom.

It is a fucking liar. Do not believe anything it says.

It lies. Plain and simple. Depression fucking lies.

I know this. This knowledge is what gets me through the dark times. I know it is a lie. I know it is wrong. Even when I cannot see the truth, I recognize the cause of that.

"I think they had nothing in common. I was born when they were older, and my siblings were born early in their marriage. They tell me stories of when my parents were about thirty, and they'd have friends over and socialize. But when they were alone, they didn't say much to each other. 

Meal times were pretty silent unless my siblings were there, too, which was rare as they're quite a bit older than me. Then they'd drive the conversation. Dad wasn't really a talker. Mom was. They'd talk to us when it was on-on-one, but when we were together, it was generally quiet. Dad would sit for hours doing crossword puzzles, and Mom would watch her shows. I'd usually take refuge in my room, and occasionally peak down the hallway to make sure they were okay. 

I think my dad was just really stoic and quiet. They were married in 1963, and they opted for a very traditional marriage, with Dad as breadwinner and Mom as the homemaker. I think their silence was Mom naturally catering to my dad's wants. 

Sadly, my parents are both deceased now. They were married for 43 years before cancer took Mom. Dad followed 3 years later. They must have loved each other. I say this because on the day of Mom's funeral, my dad broke down in tears. There's something strange about holding your 70 year old father as he's sobbing. Still, it's a precious memory. "

Also r/ZettaiRyouikiIRL/
My ex cheated on me in college and we broke up. My best friend then slept with her. We are no longer best friends...or friends for that matter. He lied about it and I didn't find out about it until 2 years later. At that point I wasn't hung up on her and was/am dating a wonderful girl. But he lied to my face and my other friends told me later he had told them he slept with her.
I miss that budget surplus more than I miss my dead parents.

Sounds like that neighbor was do for a fatal case of food poisoning.
"I've never heard my parents tell each other, ""I love you,"" nor do they call each other, ""Honey,"" ""Sweetie,"" ""babe,"" or ""darling."" Nothing like that!

But at the same time, I've never once doubted that they love each other. The first thing they do when they see each other is kiss and the last thing they do before they go out is kiss. They hold hands in public. They spend lots of quality time together and my dad comes home for lunch so he can spend more time with my mom. 

They also call each other, ""Mama"" and ""Papa,"" even though all of us kids are grown up. 

So even though I never heard them say those things you think of when you consider what makes a good relationship, through their actions, I've never been insecure about the fact that my family is built on love."

"I love this.

I'm a veterinary student and have seen a lot of animals die and done my best to comfort a lot of owners. The idea that they leave their love behind is how I handle dealing with all of that loss.

I took in a rescue when I was in high school. She was old and sick. For the first time in her life she was taken care of and loved. She loved me back with the kind of fearless love only an animal can give.

We only had a few months together before she died. I'd always thought I couldn't be a vet because I couldn't take all of the loss that comes with it. She proved me wrong.

About 8 years later, my pathetic, brave little rescue lives on every day through the love and inspiration she gave me as I live my dream and help other animals.

They never, ever leave us."

But I don't actively make fun of people who like sport because hey, it's something they like. I make sure to keep up with at least some scores so I can show interest when I'm around family who watch football, doesn't hurt me.

The US government has a massive helium reserve. For years it has been selling off this reserve which has artificially kept the price of helium low enough that we can afford to waste it on party balloons and the like. In reality helium is a limited resource that is very important to science and medicine. If it weren't for the helium reserve sales the price would probably be much higher. TLDR: the world should save helium for science and not waste it on birthday parties and funny voices.

"An Australian girl travelling alone through Barcelona. 

I, a tall guy with broad shoulders and a big frame, as well as a chronic case of resting pissed-off face, never really thought of myself as intimidating or threatening. This girl wanted to give back my friend's scarf after a couple days of not seeing each other in the hostel we were all staying at, so we went back to my friend and I's room for something or other. 

No one else was in the room, or even the hallway for that matter. The Aussie's demeanor changed from friendly to sort of anxious and she hung in the hallway, staying away from the door, and me, until I came out of the room with whatever we needed to give back the scarf.

I thought that was a bit odd until the next day when I realized everything from her perspective. She was trying to prevent being raped or robbed. She helped me become more self-aware and conscientious of how I'm coming across to people, especially strangers. I still think about that doorway now, more than five years later, when I'm trying to come off well to people."

"One of my uni friends found herself between jobs at the same time that I had a vacancy for a library assistant to take the evening shift at the college library I managed. She was overqualified for the job so I had to set strict rules about what she was being paid to do.  Given that we were friends, I also set ground rules regarding our interactions at work. ""During work hours, I'm the boss."" That sort of thing. 

One evening after work I was at home mucking around on Facebook. My friend/employee started chatting to me on Messenger and complaining about the clients she was dealing with. I guided her through some ways to deal with the clients' issues. Then she shifted the conversation to general chitchat. I reminded her that this was not appropriate behaviour for an employee to be chatting with a friend on Facebook at the library desk during library hours. She  said that she thought it was ok because my work day was over. To which I replied, ""But yours isn't and I'm your boss!!""

"Because SF is so liberal, it tends to attract a lot of the most needy, troubled people and gives them lots of support in terms of shelters, counseling, and stipends.

Despite SF's reputation, it has a visible and extreme dark side. The techies have actually cleaned a lot of it up, but much of the worst areas are zoned for nonprofits so can't be developed.

However, in the case of my former friend and others, they just wanted to do meth. Everyone knew what it did before they even tried it- it's really visible. No amount of mental health support would help them."

Thats why they taste better; theyre fully developed. You'll notice these are deep red on the inside."

"That's what pisses me off most about modern feminist movements. At this point, thinking men and women should be equal is the norm. Not all people subscribe to it, but the consensus is that those people are bigots or behind the times.

However, most people who are vocal about feminism don't want equal rights, they want superior rights. They don't want women to pay for dates or make the first move, they don't complain about the fact that terrible mothers get custody over dutiful fathers, or that males reporting rape by women get laughed out the door, or that physical abuse against men typically get the man arrested if the police are called, or that men are far more likely to be homeless than women. In fact, a while ago there was a movement along the lines of ""25% of  homeless people are women! We need to help homeless women!"", completely ignoring the irony that such a statistic means that MEN are homeless more often and are at a disadvantage.

I want equal rights for men and women, not ""equal"" rights. There are absolutely problems women face and are treated lesser than men. Until feminism starts tackling the situations where men are disadvantaged, however, we are never going to be truly equal, and there will always be a faction of resentful men who see when men are at a disadvantage, but are told they are always better off and need to shut up about the problems they face."
"The flipside of that though, is that young people are rarely sensible enough or financially secure enough to be the best parents they are capable of being.

Whereas being 20, uneducated, and unemployed with zero savings does not set your family up for success. Plan that shit."

your example seems easily affordable and this would apply more obviosly to more expensive things but lets say they save that $20 (per 2 months) it would take ~10months to reach the $90 outlay, what is he wearing on his feet for 8 months after his pair of cheap shoes shit the bed, sometimes you are simply too poor to break the cycle and ""just saving"" is a luxury of those with disposable income"

My answer would be (and I may be way off here) is that you do what authority figures ask of you because of an implied social contract - I want to live here in peace and be protected by the state, so I trust those in power (government, police etc) to exercise the power I grant them with restraint and consideration. In return, I'll engage with them whenever it's reasonable for me to do so, by voting, writing to MPs, obeying laws etc. I won't start on whether people should trust politicians or not...

Obviously you get people in power who abuse it, which is why we have a check and balance system via an independent judiciary and regulatory bodies for powerful institutions. It's not perfect by any means but I'd far prefer to have that than a situation where I'm supposed to do what someone says because he might shoot me if I don't. 

I definitely agree that people tend not to know their rights in the UK - it baffles me that it's never taught and you have to look stuff like that up yourself. Police definitely get people to incriminate themselves by asking questions they shouldn't be allowed to. "

Semi-retired business owner who thinks they can do better than the existing councillors. Usually takes a very business minded approach to things and is of the opinion people should work hard to better themselves. Usually ends up being cast as the 'bad guy' by local press because of this.

Bored housewife/househusband who treats politics as a hobby whilst living off their partners income. Enjoys pushing their views on people and shouting down opposition. Local press casts them as the loony loudmouth activists.

Career politicians who are usually very smug and full of themselves. Seem to be hard to get rid of and keep showing up. Painted as sleazy and untrustworthy by the press.

Those who genuinely care and want to make a difference are usually overshadowed by the above and don't last long as the pressure of being a councillor and juggling a job/family life gets to them after a while. They also seem to pass largely unnoticed by the press as it's hard to create attention grabbing headlines about someone who is actually good at their job.

This might be exaggerating slightly but there is still a degree of truth to it. The loud, the sleazy, the ones with character faults get all the attention, the good ones pass by unnoticed."

"So, I understand and I wish we could, but there's a problem with giving rapists the death penalty.

Say you murder someone, you can prove it without a doubt, they deserve the death penalty.

A rapist, on the other hand, has the choice to leave the victim alive after, but if they enforce the death penalty on them, there's really no benefit for them to leave their victim alive. The victim proves that person raped them, they get the death penalty, they murder the victim, they still get the death penalty so they might as well just kill their victim and have less of a chance of getting caught."

"Because the worst insult to a guy is saying he has a small dick. Like there was a sculpture that got on the front page of Reddit that was just Trump with a small dick. Of all the things the artist could say about trump, the most damaging thing they could think of was to suggest that he's got a small penis.

And then there was the Australian ad campaign where they said aggressive drivers have small dicks.

So yeah imagine if the most damning insult against a woman wasn't that she's psycho, or a bitch, or a spoiled brat, but just ""she has small tits"". Imagine how women with small tits would feel."

"A few months ago I was mowing my lawn. Unbeknownst to me some ground nesting hornets had taken up residence in the city water meter box down by the road. As I pushed the mower near the box the vibrations must have aggravated them because about a thousand fucking hornets came swarming out at me. Now these hornets are known to be extremely aggressive and will chase you up to a quarter mile away. I took off running down the street screaming obscenities like a lunatic and ripping my clothes off because they had gotten inside my shirt. I'm sure my neighbors thought I had gotten a bad batch of drugs or something. 

To make matters worse, after I had escaped them. the hornets were all swarming all over the water box and my lawn mower was still sitting right next to the box. I was literally under siege in my own fucking yard. If you got within 10 feet of them, they'd come aggressively at you. I eventually resorted to turning my sprinklers on to get them away from the mower, and I ran down there and grabbed my mower. I hastily pulled it back into my garage and called it a day.

"Life before social media. 

I'm all for the internet, but I feel like my generation was the last to really experience what it was like to have to tell your friends to meet you somewhere and pray to God they found you! Life was so much more exciting. You'd get your crushes number and call them and PRAY that their parents didn't answer. I remember how much fun it was to call into the radio station just to hear your voice on media. I remember what it was like when a day felt like an eternity because all your friends were busy. 

As much as I love what technology has done for us, I really can't appreciate enough having had a childhood that was for the most part without internet. 

Imagine how much more fun it would be if that person you met at a party wasn't someone you could just look up in a minute, and now you have to do some detective work, only to find out they did the same for you too! I don't know there was a certain amount of romance before we were all so closely connected. "

Drug use can distort experience of time, affect decision making, memory, coordination, etc. so a cook high on just about anything could could easily forget to wash their hands before undercooking a dish made with expired ingredients, then drop it on the floor and then decide, ""yeah, that's good, send it out."" doing even one of those things can easily get someone sick, and all it takes is the right bacteria and the wrong immune system for that to turn lethal.

&amp;nbsp;

The closest we've ever come to a comment about anything in the family was my Dad musing once that it's a shame we didn't get to tell Grandpa about us before he died, because Gramps was a complete asshole on every level, including racist, who we all hated (deservedly) - and Dad would have enjoyed fucking with him. 

&amp;nbsp;

Outside family, there's been exactly one comment our whole lives - a guy who was drunk in a parking lot at about two or three in the afternoon once wailed at us that it's unfair women would choose a guy like me over him - and went on to make a series of racist yells about it to the world.  I'm pretty sure he was dumped that morning and was just hurting more than anything else, but whatever.

"To add to this, study *daily*. 

I know so many people who had to cram for midterms and finals while I was chilling since I already knew the material. I only knew the material because I put in time during the semester (at least half an hour per class, usually 1-2 depending on the lesson and homework) so I knew everything down pat and only had to review for a few hours before the tests. This is also super helpful for summer and winter breaks. If you know the material really well after studying it daily, you can enter the new semester with the knowledge from the previous class and you won't have to spend time reviewing past material in the new semester.

Or a job where they're treated like they're incapable of making any decisions? Or a job that expects you to put your work first and your life never?

I have a lady who tries to always put me or others on blast for being on our phones. Loudly erupts if something we do is different than how she does. She only knows her way, which is not efficient. She feels threatened and tries to make younger workers looks bad because she thinks it will make her look good.

I had a mohawk, and a sea bag. I'm walking around in big black boots and wore a leather jacket and a flannel. This middle aged suburban mom lady said she liked my hair and was just super friendly. She was also stuck in the airport for 8 hours. So we wondered around and talked. We probably looked super odd but she was such a nice lady. We got soft pretzels and she showed me pictures of her family and her dogs. She bought me a scarf that I still have. The next flight was the next day, so Delta put me and a few other booted  passengers in a hotel in Atlanta for the night. Me and Susan got Chinese food and she knocked on my door to make sure I made the flight the next day. It was such an odd experience. I got the feeling she always had a vagabond streak but never got too live it. Settling down and having a happy stable life. She was such a mom. Was a lovely time."

"Long story short: the US funded the Mujahadeen not the taliban and they are separate groups. 

So during the Soviet war in Afghanistan the US funded a large number of groups, usually grouped as the mujahadeen. They existed prior to US involvement, but the US provided funding and weaponry. Ten years later the war ends. Fast forward to the taliban later. The taliban is formed as an Islamist extremist group whose goal is varying but is essentially Islamic government and removing western influence. They are a terrorist group. Some of the people and groups who were in the Mujahadeen joined the taliban, some opposed it, and some were in the middle or uninvolved in this new fight. 

So the US didn't fund the taliban; it funded a large number of people, some of whom later joined the taliban."

"From the transcript:

&gt;Perhaps it's the recent 10-year anniversary of the event, or perhaps it's the former Arizona governor's recent confession that he believes they were actually an alien spacecraft, but the Phoenix Lights have been back in the news again. It was the night of March 13, 1997 when a slanting line of bright lights appeared one-by-one in the sky beyond Phoenix, Arizona. Hundreds of photographs and videos were taken by observers throughout the region, making it among the most documented UFO sightings ever. The incident came as no surprise to anyone at nearby Luke Air Force Base (named for World War I ace Lt. Frank Luke), which operates the Barry M. Goldwater Range where a flight of four A-10 ground attack aircraft were jettisoning leftover illumination flares. The flares are typically dropped at lower altitudes, where they are not visible from Phoenix, due to the intervening Sierra Estrella mountain range.

&gt;The Phoenix Lights episode is a running joke in the Air Force and especially at the 104th Fighter Squadron of the Maryland Air National Guard, whose aircraft were involved. They don't have desert bombing ranges in Maryland, so the pilots go to places like Arizona for some of their training. The Air National Guard is the Air Force's reserve unit, similar to the Army Reserve.

&gt;But the rest of us regular people didn't know anything about this. We all just looked up into the sky, and saw something unlike anything we'd ever seen before. I remember watching it on the news with my wife. I remember my sense of amazement at witnessing something truly unexplainable: Could this actually be alien spacecraft?

I showed up, and she seemed alright. In a pretty good mood, but had some dizzyness. I went to pick up some food for her, and when I came back, she was out of it. She didn't know where she was, or who I was. She was completely out of it over the next week, until she finally died. I never did get to say goodbye, even though I knew it was coming.

She saw it coming, and ducked. If she hadn't, I would not have a mother today. The concrete hit the headrest of her seat and she was able to come to a stop at the side of the road, before being joined by a kind man who had seen what happened.

In high school, us band geeks were all a very tight knit group and very close to our band director (tiny school).

As soon as someone entered, we'd all let out a bellow of ""Story!"" and our director would give them a look of ""you better do it"". 

Well one morning I forgot my glasses at home. A girl in my grade walks in the door, and apparently I'm the only one unable to see that she's crying horribly. I belt out ""Stoorrryyy!""

She had been sent to our room to inform us that our classmate and close friend since Kindergarten (like I said, small school; most of us even went to the same daycare) had been t-boned by a semi on the way to school. He didn't make it.

"To put it in financial terms:

Riskier investments provide a higher rate of return, on average, than safer investments.  You can make more money in the long term by making a large number of risky (but carefully chosen) investments, and simply accepting that you are going to lose money on the majority of them.  This is how venture capital works.  In a less extreme case, this is how starting a business works.

If you don't HAVE a large amount of money to start with, though, then you simply can't tolerate the fluctuations and don't have the capital to sufficiently diversify, and you are forced to settle for a less profitable strategy.

In the extreme case of lack of resources (ie, the situation that 99+% of us live in), you actually have to make investments that have a negative expected return to get your net worth fluctuations down to a level you can survive.  We call these investments ""insurance""."

These were around school run times.

Similarly, I've been out with my boyfriend before when he's suddenly leant over to me and whispered ""there's a man behind us wearing X who has been following us for a while."" We then went and sat with a group of people and waited about 10 minutes for the man to move away. Guess what? Once again in broad daylight.

(If she sees this, ilu, you didn't know at the time, and stop checking my Reddit account.)

So I stayed hydrated and didn't eat for a week. 

I actually would've kept going, but I spent the next week in Pittsburgh with like eight friends and people kinda notice when you're all in a hotel room. I think I choked down a few veggie subs, ~~alcohol~~ jk I remember volunteering to be the sober escort because of them booze kcals, a bunch of candy while blazed off my ass the night before we left, and not much else. People noticed. It was awkward.

1) Wouldn't recommend doing this, anyone, ever, just in case for some batshit reason anyone read this and was like ""oh cool, neato burrito idea"". I ended up having to have surgery a few months down the road from that if I remember the timeline right, because rapid weight loss can do crazy shit to your gallbladder that makes doctors throw opioids at you before you even ask for the painkillers. I turned it down against doc's orders and cut out all fat from my diet so the attacks would stop. Got lucky and it worked.

2) I actually contacted a local professional center yesterday and hopefully eventually this can all just be a zany story I never, ever tell at parties or to anyone else besides an infinite number of strangers on the internet in conversations about starving to death in the jungle.

**Symptoms I noticed:** physical weakness, headaches if I wasn't careful enough to stay hydrated, being an irritable squirrel about virtually everything, and probably hunger. My hunger signals are pretty wonky and a lot of the time I don't notice them. Low blood pressure, too - at really shitty times, have to take lukewarm showers instead of hot ones to avoid getting dizzy. Sometimes empty stomach = nausea and vomiting from the acid, but for some reason I don't think this cropped up then. Stomach definitely shrank.

edit: also, hella insomnia and feeling weirdly energized after a few days, but not really in a good way. iirc, basically at the same time as physically having no energy! weird times man.

edit edit: also, cards on the table, don't expect to poop if all you eat is meat/protein/nothing for a week. this is probably over the line of TMI but this conversation is like 5 screen inches above another chat about dingoes eating babies. shit happens."

You would think a city of this size would have some meaningful infrastructure, but it is a clusterfuck. My one weekend there was marred with the most traffic accidents I have ever witnessed on a per-mile ratio in my life. It isn't just the god-awful drivers, it is the rolling labyrinth of mazes that they call a highway system that leads to this misery. When we first arrived, there were 11 accidents in a 14 mile stretch; what kind of ratio is that? On top of that, I watched cops pull people over for seemingly petty offenses all around the city. You'll never see as many blue lights flickering in your life as you will on a drive through El Paso.

"I went to my son's middle school and had a loud argument outside the office about their incompetence and the right to mark your attacker.

Legally there is no legal way to charge a person for leaving bodily marks upon someone who is attacking them.  Its also a Right in the United States to defend yourself.

Its not a Right that some moron in a suit can take away.

I explained all these things to the Disciplinarian/Deputy Principal in public in front of 300 kids and about 100 parents at about 92 decibels.   

Then I explained that if they fail to tighten security to the point that my son stopped being assaulted, they will have forgone their right to be in charge of security at the school and I would provide immediacy for my Son throughout the day and bill them at $250.00 per hour for it.

The school resource Deputy stood right there facing us.

Just because the disciplinary officers of the school aren't present doesn't mean they're not *personally* responsible for the safety and well-being of the students who are attacked.   I straight up told him that the next time my son came home with bruised ribs that I would charge the the Deputy Principal with aggravated assault of a minor.

The Deputy Sheriff looked the man in the eyes for a while.  

**The school had a rule that if there were no witnesses, no violation had been committed.**

Schools do not have any protection against lawsuits over the abuse of children by other children.  Judges usually refer such charges to remediation by a Superintendent but a Superintendent is *not* a lawmaking body - they often think they can make rules that violate civil rights and sometimes they find out doing so is a Felony.

"Had a government job and wanted to make a career out of it. I was young, single, keen, and free to travel. 

A leaflet landed on my desk promoting an accelerated promotion/mentoring/networking programme aimed at young, keen employees who were willing to travel. It was perfect. 

I dialled the number on the back and told the woman who answered that I was interested. She started taking down my details, name, office, staff number etc. But then she asked me what my ethnicity was. I was a bit surprised as it seemed like an odd thing to ask. 

""Umm...white..."" I said. 

""Sorry, this course isn't for you"" she said, and put the phone down on me. 

I complained to my supervisor and said this is racial discrimination. She said ""No, it isn't. It's Affirmative Action"". She refused to help. 

I contacted my union but they said the same thing.

But it has nothing to do with age for me. I'm a short man with a physical disability and social dependency, so women tend to view me as ""not good for relationship"", which is totally understandable. Who wants to get into a relationship only to babysit an adult?

As such, I've more or less accepted that I'll never be intimate with anyone. And hiring a prostitute would only hurt me more, as it'd be someone doing a job rather than being with me because they want me."

"Working as an English teacher in China. 

I worked there from 2002-2014. In the last few years, it wasn't so bad, but back in 2002-2008 (before Beijing had the Olympics) it was pretty bad. Schools would hire foreign teachers who were clearly degenerate maniacs/perverts/possible pedophiles, and not do any kind of background check/criminal record check. 

There were creepy 50 year old men, working with children during the day, and spending all their money on prostitutes during the evenings, and if you know China at all, a fair amount of their prostitutes are underage. 

Now please don't put me on r/badass or r/thathappened or whatever, but I was disciplined at my school and nearly got in trouble with the police for punching a 55 year old Australian man in the face for saying ""she's a pretty girl, look at her, she knows it"" in regards to an 8 year old girl.

"When I moved to Chicago, I was moving from out of state, so I didn't get a chance to check out the place...but for the low price of $500 with everything included, in a nice neighborhood with a jacuzzi...how bad could it have been?, I thought. I get there, and the place was very nice aesthetically, but whoever stayed in my room before me left behind a shit ton of gross, dirty/sticky VHS porn tapes and a cooking spoon and a pipe for meth, heroin or crack I guess. If that wasn't bad enough, the guy who owned the house and was my roommate stalked me on OKCupid the whole time I lived there, would scold me every time I had a male friend come over as if he was my partner or something, and then one night, I woke up to find his clothes in my room. He apparently got drunk and was naked in my room while I was sleeping, who the fuck knows what he did while I was asleep. And then the kicker, I was really naive due to being young and didn't know enough to rip up unused checks, he stole a check out of my trash and cashed it...$500 worth. 

I don't know what's worse, that dude...or the psychotic cat lady who took me in off the streets, ya know because she is a die hard Christian lady and that's what Jesus would do. But she would flip the fuck out over the smallest things, like her printer jammed one day...so what did she do? She took the printer and threw it across the room in a blind rage, almost hit one of her cats with it too. She also had an issue with me having male friends over, because she apparently wasn't ""running a whore house"". She also accused me of stealing her coca cola, I fucking hate coca cola. Also accused me of making her dishes smell like fish after I cooked fish, even though I scrubbed the fuck out of the pan multiple times and couldn't smell anything. She also regularly complained about ""the queers"", Angelina Jolie and how she's a massive slut and how Obama was the antichrist and secretly a Muslim. Also proceeded to tell me about her involvement in BDSM, which was completely out of the blue and unrelated to anything we had been talking about, also gross to think about since I found her to be very unpleasing aesthetically.

There was that one time I ended up living with a creepy registered sex offender (dude fucked a 13 yo. boy). He treated his dog like shit - yanking him up by his neck roughly with a choke collar on when the dog didn't even do anything wrong, he admitted it was to assert dominance over the dog even though that dog was one of the most well behaved dogs I had ever seen, even without training. Also ALL of the dogs he ever had throughout his whole life were named Jessie, and were all chocolate labs. He was super anal about cleaning things, I am definitely NOT a neat freak. He seemed to lack any empathy, probably had severe asperger's syndrome. He was only slightly better than the previous 2 roommates mentioned."
The Donald
"Depending on your POV, I may be the one from ""hell"" in this situation, but having been there, I feel like my actions were justified.
In college, all 3 of my roommates junior year either graduated or moved out so I had three new random ones for my senior year. They all had problems. The one next door to my room would constantly sing Alicia Keyes' ""No One"" over and over at the top of his lungs along with other songs too high for his voice. The walls were paper thin so I was constantly asking him to shut the hell up.

One was a large dude (6 ft 3 or 4) and not in any type of good shape. He would walk around in the same clothes he slept in all day, stinking up the common room. One time, he knocked on my door frantically yelling that he was going blind. He claimed that he had woken up just now (about 2 in the afternoon) and couldn't see. I asked if he had been drinking the night before and he claimed he hadn't. He was basically acting like a 5 year old and wanted me to call 911, so I did for the very first time ever. I was shaking from stress when I did because this was such a ridiculous situation. The amublance came to our dorm and wanted to take him to the hospital, but as soon as they came into our room, he claimed he was fine. The EMT's were like ""Are you sure you don't want us to drive you to the hospital?"" and he was just like ""No, no, no, I feel a little better"". There was literally a moment of me looking of the EMT's and me looking at each other like Oliver Hardy or Jim from the Office. As soon as they left, my roommate wanted me to take him to the hospital. It was right down the street, but I was just like, ""What the hell is going on, man?!"" I had an important rehearsal to get to so I refused to wait with him there, but I did follow him in my car as he drove himself the half mile, just in case he ""went blind"". When I got home about 6 hours later, he was sitting in our common room eating a pint of Ben and Jerry's. Didn't even bring up what had happened to me. I asked and he said the doctor had said he had a hangover. I brought up that he claimed to have not been drinking. He shrugged his shoulders.

He also stayed over winter break while everyone else went home. When I came back, the toilet was drenched in piss. I asked him about it and he claimed it had been like that the entire week and that he had just used the toilet in the hall. !!!!!!!
The final dude was an acquaintance of mine, although we didn't talk much. I had shared cable with my prior roommates, so I offered to get it installed again for the new ones. I handled the bill and they were suppose to pay me every month. At the beginning it was ok. Then they all started to fall behind, but I kept track of all they owed. I guess by the end of the year, they all owed me about 2-3 months worth, so 30-60 bucks each. When I finally got annoyed about it, this acquaintance said he had decided not to pay me because ""I had more channels than they did and that wasn't fair"". The truth was, I did have the main box in my room, but everyone had access to everything. The only thing I had extra was On Demand, and specifically, WWE on Demand which I paid for myself and didn't add to their charges. Despite trying to explain this, he refused to pay me and the other two jumped on the bandwagon.

This all culminated in a situation where we had to clean the dorm in preparation for the end of the school year. It was filthy. I literally was only in my own room the entire time I was in the dorm, so the mess was all theirs. I wanted to make sure it got taken care of so I offered to do the bathroom, if they would do everything else. This was agreed upon so I went to work. No one ever refilled paper towels or toilet paper so I had stockpiled some in my room that I would use only for me. I used some of that to clean the bathroom (which was just filthy), but ran out. Rather than buy some cleaning products, I went looking for something to use and settled on a sponge in the kitchen. Looking back, obviously that was a DUMB thing to do, but I just figured, ""Oh, a sponge, that'll help scrub off some of this dried urine"". When I had the floor and toilet looking pristine, I put the sponge back and forgot about it.

Cut to 2 weeks later. I came back from a rehearsal to find all 3 roommates waiting for me in the common area. They were confronting me about me being a bad roommate. I was like ""Whoa, what the hell is going on here?"". I brought up the cable and they turned it around on me, saying I had been cheating them. When I started to get mad, my ""acquaintance"" started yelling and asked me how I had cleaned the bathroom. I told him the sponge and he freaked. Apparently, he had been using it for the past 2 weeks to clean his dishes and now had a sore throat which he claimed was as a result. I literally hadn't even considered that when I used the sponge in the bathroom (idiotic, I know) but I couldn't help but laugh when thinking of him washing his dishes with a soap stained with his own pee.

I ended up moving out first because I was done with exams, and it felt like the end of the movie, ""The Birds"" as they stared at my friend and I carrying stuff to my car.

TLDR: Had three horrible roommates. One had me call 911 when he had a horrible hangover. One refused to pay for cable so I accidentally washed the bathroom with his kitchen sponge which he then used and got a sore throat

"This happened in my city, Manchester, in a large precinct containing many bars, pubs, some restaurants and a cinema (The Printworks, if that wasn't obvious enough).

There was a large club, the name of which I forget, which usually had a dozen or so people, maybe more, along with a few bouncers stood outside (which was still technically indoors). This was around eight on a weekend, so plenty of families, some kids and regular folk going about their business, not aiming to drink and get fucked up.

I saw one girl, visibly shit-faced, with her arm around a guy as he fingered her. There was nothing even remotely inconspicuous about what they were doing either. It was plain as a day. She was being fingered as dozens of people walked past and watched, shaking their heads. The guy was laughing like a caveman in front of his equally scumbag, piece of shit friends, and she looked like she gave no fucks whatsoever.

Yay, Manchester."

"On the other hand, had I listened to my parents and friends, I would have ended what is now a happy solid marriage unnecessarily. We were going through a massive medical stressor and they did not understand what that was like at all, or how it was wrapped up in our relationship dynamics. The recognized that it was a stressor, but just didn't get it at all.

The problem was, at the time we didn't recognize the nature of the stressor either, so what they were saying seemed kind of reasonable. Only in hindsight does the scope of it make sense.

Knowing when to listen to others and when to ignore them is important, but it's much more difficult to do in practice than it sounds.

I've come to a place where I think that the only people who really know what's going on are the two people in the relationship, and maybe therapists. We went to a couples counselor, and looking back that was many times more helpful than talking to family or friends. "

I used to work at a jail. One night I was working cameras and I was just flipping through the screens and we had a camera facing the inside of the door to the solitary hallway and one facing the outside door. The door had a little one foot square window at about face level. The buzzer to open the door went off so I checked them to see who it was that I needed to let in and I could see a face in the window looking through from the inside but in the other camera there wasn't anybody there. It gave me chills and I never wanted to work that section again.
"First of all, obviously OP is referring to extraterrestrials when he says UFOs

Secondly, there's a lot of garbage anecdotes and ""what if"" postulation in this thread, and only one top post about the (statistically low) likelihood that we are the only/first intelligent life in the universe. Statistically speaking because of how old the universe is and when we arose it is ridiculously unlikely that a) this is the only planet with life on it and b) that we are the only or first intelligent life. Doesn't mean it's impossible, and there are likely factors that we don't understand yet that influence the beginning of life/intelligence. But it's something to keep in mind.

As to extraterrestrials cruising around Earth's atmosphere in UFOs, there are so many independent accounts of similar sightings and incidents, going back to before these things got into the zeitgeist thanks to scifi movies, that you have to consider the possibility they're real. There's a great podcast called mysterious universe which partly makes fun of crazy theories and is partly fascinated with the possibility some of it could be real. So it's not ancient aliens trash, there's healthy skepticism and they interview people who take UFOs etc seriously, but aren't tin foil hat conspiracists either. It's really interesting and funny and I'd recommend it to most people in this thread.

"When I was 12 my friend invited me to say with him at a resort on the beach for a few days. When I arrived, he told me that the lights in our room turned on when you clapped. Doubtfully I clapped and sure enough, the lights turned on. I clapped again and the lights turned off. I was blown away by how fancy this resort was. I had seen men clap to dim the lights in romantic movie scenes, but I thought that was just in movies. My friend then told me that if you make a ""Whoooosh"" sound with your mouth, the ceiling fan turned on. Sure enough, when I tried it worked. So for 3 days I was walking around our resort room (in front of his older sister and parents) clapping to turn on the lights and making a ""Whoooosh"" sound to turn on the ceiling fans. On the fourth day (the day I was leaving), I found a remote on my friend's bed. It had two buttons - Light and Fan ......"

I don't have many female friends, so maybe this makes me hypocritical, but I really wish I did. Just a matter of chance that I'm an introvert and my best friend is a guy, so I end up friends with his guy friends that come around. Whenever I hear a girl say things like this, she always seems to be pleased to be the center of attention in a group of guys, and rejects any other girl who dares to divert any of that attention. I've been let down many times trying to make friends with girls like this when guys are around - they sometimes seem offended by just my presence. It's a real bummer, and leads me to think she wants validation more than she wants real friends."

"People who call those who commit suicide ""selfish"".

""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

"I don't have any great stories about my parents, but I've come up with some fun ways to mess with my kids. 

When my kids have a misunderstanding about something, I like to reinforce it until they figure it out on their own. 

One day I was making my kids French toast. I had my older son dip the bread into the batter. When he was done, he thanked me for letting him help french the toast. For a couple years after I would ask him if he wanted to french the toast, and would thank him for helping french the toast. Eventually he learned about France, and that French things come from France, and concluded that dipping bread in batter was not an act of ""frenching."" 

Similarly, when he was three or four he referred to the food processor as a Weezer Bleezer. We have the whole extended family calling it that now, and my goal is that he learns the proper name from his girlfriend in college. "

These people don't typically get the really important clients though. Its all about appearance. Big firms hire a ton of ditsy girls and stupid guys simply because they either know someone in the firm or they're attractive. When I was at one of the Big 4 firms, I was on a large publicly-traded client. I remember the senior manager calling me into his office. Most awkward meeting of my life.

"This will probably get buried, but still. When I was 6 my dad passed away from cancer. After his death, I was playing in my garden when I found a small stone just laying in the grass, it was in the shape of a kidney and I was so drawn to it that I kept in my pocket and showed it to my mum later. I still remember her sad smile when she told me to 'keep it safe.' 
It wasn't until I was older and we began talking about my father again that I found out he had suffered from kidney cancer. There was no reason for that stone to be in my all grass garden, and yeah, it probably is just a strange coincidence... But I just can't get over the feeling of protection I still have over this small stone. I haven't told anyone since I never speak about my dad, it just sounds stupid now anyways.

"I was working at a resort on a ski mountain and one of my co-workers was getting married. He reserved and prepaid for the Honeymoon suite for the night of the wedding itself. His plans was to stay the one night there, and head to the airport the next morning to fly out on their honeymoon.

He made his reservation over a year in advance. He checked it 6 months out, and again 3 months, 2 months, 1 month, 2 weeks, week before, and the night before. Everything seemed to be good until he arrived with his bride. 

That afternoon, some people from out of town had arrived and asked to be lodged in the honeymoon suite. The front desk clerk declined, citing that it was already reserved. The owners wound up getting involved and conceded to move the existing reservation and put the newcomers in the honeymoon suite because they were willing to pay an extra $50 premium. 

When my friend arrived and found out they were expected, with no refund or employee discount, to stay in a different room, he was notably upset. He complained to the workers, before having the owner summoned. By the time she showed up, he was beyond anger and while he worked the role of an upset customer, the harshest language was saying this was ""an unacceptable way to run any reputable business."" Eventually, and I don't know the details of the deal, they wound up in another room.

After they went to their room, the owner went to the kitchen and demand the chef fire my friend. There was no good way to contact him on his honeymoon, and the head chef had to just write him off the schedule and wait until he came back. I rode up with him when he got back. He had a closed door session with the head chef and came back out the to car. ""I probably should've expected that.""

The place got sold out to a chain and closed down within a year or two anyway, so he doesn't have too many hard feelings, but he is watching the obituaries and planning a party when the owner finally dies."

"""Negging"" and shit doesn't work on girls you actually want to date. It might work on girls you want a one night stand with, but if you want a relationship to last leave the PUA nonsense at home

If all you're getting back is one word and noncommittal answers, the flirting isn't working, cut your losses and move on to the next girl. 

Notice little things about the girl and ask about them. For example, I wear fancy shoes most of the time. Guys noticing my fancy shoes and asking me about them and telling me that they look great instantly engages me in a conversation. Check for cool jewelry, a nice manicure, shoes, little things that the girl obviously put some effort in to and compliment her on them. Ask her where she got them and what not."

"I definitely didn't guess cane sword, but I would have given him the job on the stipulation that he sourced me a cane sword."
"This isn't a single event, and I generally don't share this as most people dismiss it as pure coincidence or tell me I'm lying/crazy. I have a strange ability to predict or incite events.

Some examples:

* Randomly thought of a colleague I'd worked with years prior and had no contact with since.  An hour later read he'd died in a plane crash that day. 

* Likewise, random friends or associate's names will come to mind for no apparent reason. Next minute they'll call or text. 

* A number will stick in my head for no apparent reason and I think about it all day (like a song you can't get out of your head). That number will then present itself somehow. The other day I had 8217 in my mind. Later that day a colleague handed me their phone and asked for help with something, I asked their unlock code... ""it's 8217"". 

* Less common this one: I have about 5000 songs on my phone, lots of different artists and they play on random shuffle - no way to predict what order it will play. I can think ""would really like to hear $song by $artist"". That plays next. 

* Know who has texted or emailed before looking at my phone. In one example, had my phone in my pocket and heard the email received notification. Suddenly started thinking of an obscure product I use. Pull out phone, read email, it's from the company who makes this product. They've emailed me maybe 5 times in 10 years, so it's not a regular email. 

* Dreams I have will often ""play out"" in real life the next day. Normally I'd just write it off as trying to rationally associate the dream and event, however the specifics can't be explained. Examples: 

Dreamt someone threw a chocolate ice cream sundae over me, next day was in a restaurant and a waitress dropped a chocolate ice cream sundae, a small amount of which landed on my leg. 

Years ago dreamt that the Hulk attacked my car and tore it apart, next day I was in a minor collision in a car park (rear-ended), the woman's son was wearing a Hulk t-shirt. 

The most bizarre of these was being woken from a dream where I was being arrested and taken to jail. Who woke me? The sheriff, attempting to serve an arrest warrant on the previous tenant. 

* From time to time I can predict what someone is going to say.  Normally it's just general context, but it's still freaky given how random &amp; precise it can be.  One time I was talking to a customer and I thought ""this is going to be urgent, he's going on holiday on Thursday"".  Then he says ""Is there any chance this can be done before Thursday morning?  I'm taking a trip then"".  I'd never met this customer before and there was simply no way to know this.  

Someone once suggested I'm in tune with the universe and have enhanced mind/brain power.  Another person made the suggestion I'm creating false memories after the fact.  Others have said I'm outright bullshitting."

"Just wanted to say a few words, since I grew up in a similar situation. I was conceived due to the aftermath of a horrific rape that my Mother endured when she was 21 in college. Her story is similar to yours. She wanted to carry me to term in order for me to be adopted, and she did this all alone. She decided to keep me, here we are 18 years later, and she is my best friend. It is difficult knowing that someone did something so brutal and horrific to her, but she is thankful to have me. She is my hero, and I know your daughter will idolize you as well. Just be open and honest with her. I am sure it is hard, but once you look past the genetic information, you will see a young girl who will love and cherish you for the rest of your life. Best of luck. "

On phone so it'll be short. 

Uncle Eddie accepted several Japanese ships surrender.

The captain or possibly someone of lower rank gave him a sword as a gesture of goodwill. The sword was kept in his little home for years. Until my mother attempted to get it valued.
We knew that Japan mass manufactured ceremonial swords for various ranks in the military.  But this sword appeared to be different. Something about the handle. Possibly very old and was a family heirloom rather than just a typical WWII sword. We got it appraised but were informed it was a offensive weapon and would be confiscated by that police. This is in Britain. Rather than try to sell she donated it. 

We never found what happened to it.

Life of Brian or The Meaning of Life? Movies that openly made fun of the Catholic Church in 1970's/80's Conservative Britain? That shit was mind blowing.

Now, two things hurt Monty Python: The first is watching a Monty Python movie or the TV series is a bit like looking at a model T ford. It seems a lot more primitive and ordinary than it was when it was first aired.

The second is that in the nearly 50 years since it first aired, it's gone from movies and shows in context to just quotes and references...and as much as I roared with laughter the first time I heard the Knights who say Ni...50 years or repetition has drained most of the humor out of it.

But, I consider what she did a form of cheating, honestly. A very mild form, but a form nonetheless. This guy who is practically a complete stranger knows that I went to bed and cried after we had the discussion and decided it was over, that we hadn't had sex in months, etc. etc. She was telling him shit I didn't tell my closest friends. When I found her open Facebook page and read through months worth of messages of him *heavily* flirting with her, telling her to leave me, telling her he'd treat her right (like, whatever dude, I was running myself *ragged* trying to please her), I think the only way I can describe how I felt is violated.

"That's mostly a myth.

Old jokes about concrete shoes aside, the mafia would much rather put someone inside a drumbarrel and fill it with concrete and dump the person in deep water if they wanted to get rid of a body. Attaching concrete blocks to someone's feet with rope and then dropping them into water is an unnecessary complicated way of killing someone. Use rope and once the rop rots away the body will float or move downstream. If you use chains the body will become separated once it starts to rot and decay.

And the case is mysterious, but regarded as solved by the police. Marco is not the first man to kill his family before killing himself. He tied that concrete block to his feet before jumping off a bridge in Lauenburg, near Hamburg. That's where his body was found. No signs of drugs in his body, no marks on his body indicating he had fought with someone or tried to get away from someone. There was a family conflict and he had been struggling with mental issues.

"There's a drowning risk there that is very real, but disease and such is generally not that bad at public pools and might be less than at private pools depending on how well the water is managed.

1.  Very little disease transmitting material ever gets into the water (blood, feces, semen, etc can transmit disease.  Generally sweat and urine do not).

2.  Any pool with adequate water management will have sufficient chlorine/bromine/whatever other system to neutralize any disease threat.  

The biggest risk disease-wise in public pools is the ones that are outdoors (sun causes chlorine to evaporate out of water), shallow (higher surface area to volume ratio means more evaporation of chlorine), overcrowded, or mismanaged.  

You are far far more likely to get sick from eating something from a concession stand than from swimming in a public pool.

"Great question. No, that office did not have any explicit work times that the employees had to abide by (meetings being an exception). I made sure of that by going through the on-boarding paperwork, as well as discussing my plans with my direct manager. From a technical standpoint, I didn't have to get approval from my manager, but I did so out of normal courtesy and the fact I liked working for them. As long as I put in my 8 hours and did the right thing, it didn't matter what time of day it was (again, meetings aside).

Most people arrived between 8-9am and worked until 4:30-5:30pm. Those that arrived earlier or later worked the expected amount of hours. My position at that office was based around data mining and putting together reports. As a result, I was for the most part, on my own time as long as I stayed ahead of the work load. Prior to my trip, I completed work which wasn't due until the following week. Essentially, any work that I'd miss during the last few hours that Thursday afternoon and all of that Friday would just be favors for coworkers (which I do not mind doing at all). 

I worked my ass off those 4 days, and nobody seemed to notice me until I was ""leaving early"" that Thursday afternoon. When I showed proof I put in a full day's work, just earlier than usual, HR and upper management just thanked me for being diligent and apologized for wasting my time; it was a relaxed office with the exception of those coworkers."

"We had no idea what we were doing when buying a house. Our agent

 • Sent us listings

 • Arranged times for us to tour listings

 • Guided us through the homes pointing out things we would have missed, like when we'd likely need to replace the water heaters, furnaces, and the roof and how much that would cost, that the nice looking cabinets that were made of easily-chipped materials, that the brand of electrical boxes needs replacing and how much THAT would cost

 • Facilitated communication between us, the seller, the titling agency, and our mortgage broker.

"I think what kills relationships is not that one partner is spending some of their time doing a solo activity, it's that one partner is spending some time doing a solo activity at the expense of time spent with their partner.

So like, if you and your spouse have busy lives (jobs, kids, whatever), and you might only have one night a week free for both of you to hang out and do couple stuff. If you make time somehow for a second night a week for you to do whatever, that's okay. But if you sacrifice that one night a week with the spouse for your 'me time', that's when relationships break down."

The wine at this dinner was hands down some of the best I've ever had, and it was perfectly paired with the food. Tasting my partner's wine with my food made that even more apparent.

For the most part, it's not to say ""this is the best wine"" but rather ""this is definitely a good wine, and it goes well with this dish from the chef."" A master sommelier would be able to take a bunch of cheap wines and pair them with frozen dinners.

"One of my friends lost her son to a car accident. He could've survived, but tried to take the car out of a ditch...and the car fell on him and crushed him until he asphyxiated and died. One brutal way to go. She still is trying, years later, to live on despite it. "

"It's not like it can't be understood, but nobody will see it from your perspective. I would go so far as to say that it can't be understood **by those that have the disorder**. Oma died because of this a few months ago. Barely made it to 60 years old and was *almost* 70 pounds. She weighed as much as a first grader and looked like a walking skeleton near the end.

Even when trying to recover after a near-death experience that most would find to be a wake-up call, her morning ""cereal"" was basically 6 Cheerios with water and flax seed. She drank a couple gallons worth of water and decaf coffee throughout the day, and the coffee was always brought to a boil and drank immediately upon removing from the microwave. She never saw her self as underweight, and even thought she was fat at one point. After having the disorder most of her life, it seems she was just too far gone for anyone to save her, no matter how hard we tried.

She went as far as to inquire about the calories in the IVs they were using for her to recover in the hospital (low sodium and blood sugar that led to her collapse, potential brain damage, and her body trying to consume her organs for nourishment). My dad snapped at her, quite calmly considering the circumstances, ""[Name], that's not your breakfast, it's what's keeping you from dying.""

***

**Edit:** I've rambled enough, but fuck it, it's on my mind now. She would cry whenever confronted, no matter how delicately it was brought up, and no matter how much you sympathized and cared for her, it was always deflection and redirection and when that didn't work, it was crying. It makes me so fucking upset to think about now, and I never talk about it with anyone anymore. It's just painful to watch someone with such a kind heart that you've never had anything but love for just kill themselves slowly in front of you. Everyday you notice more and more of them whither away. And they lie to your face with that stupid smile and tell you they're doing better. I'm just **so** goddamn angry with her, and I never let her know any of that. I was always her grandson and I know she would've never wanted me to think of her in any negative light, and especially not know of her disorder.

I don't know if me telling her this would've helped any, because the last thing I wanted to do was break my dying Oma's heart, but here I am, emotions pouring out in a conversation that is 11 hours old and will probably be seen by 2 or 3 people, if they care to read another sob story. There's just so much anger and sadness all mixed together and I miss her so much even though it feels like I barely talked to her outside of my childhood and my last memories of her are of this fucking mess of a skeleton that couldn't be reasoned with. But not a blabbering brain-dead idiot like I'm making her out to be. She was an amazing person that cared so much and she was always her, just less and less each day.

Fuck. I'm sorry, Oma, but fuck you. Fuck you for leaving us the way you did. Fuck you for hurting my Opa so fucking much. Fuck you for not caring about yourself the way you cared about others. And fuck you for not caring about your family enough to just fucking STOP. Is it really that fucking hard to see your eyes sinking into your sockets? Every single one of your veins that the nurses can't hit because they're so fucking tiny they can barely pump blood? Every little bruise from bumping things? What goes through your dense fucking skull when you wake up in the hospital and everyone is SURPRISED? What do you think it means when the pastor gave you your last rights? Somewhere, deep down, I know you knew how close you came to dying. Otherwise you wouldn't have lied to my goddamn face all the time about getting better. And I never said fucking anything. I never prompted you to talk about it, and I never responded when you talked about it, because you're my Oma and I love you and I don't wanna see you hurt and I don't want you to see how much you hurt me. But goddamn it just made me angry. And I'm still angry. And I'll probably always be angry, because I never said anything. I just watched you die. For months, I watched you die. Just hoping it didn't happen. Hoping you turned it around.

But you didn't wake up one morning. Opa couldn't get you to respond. You had asked him to just let you die. Next time he found you, he was supposed to let you die. He waited. He listened to your growly breaths and your dying moans for a half-hour and he couldn't do it. He went through all that pain, and then guilt for not letting it happen. More frustration. More nutritionists. He did everything to keep you alive. He tried to make you happy, but you just wanted to die. Secretly, you wanted to die. You thought you were being so fucking sneaky buying milk and letting it sit in the fridge. Stocking foods and never eating them. Every bowl of flax, every shitty veggie peanut ice desert thing you ate, every glass of water you guzzled 3 times at the sink before sitting down with another full one, every one nibble, then drink of water, then drink of coffee, then nibble, then water, then coffee, then nibble, then water, then coffee, we knew you were closer and closer to death. 

Again you collapsed, body surely twisted, and blood spilling out of your mouth, like the first time. Only this time, I wasn't called. I saw the ambulance go by my house, and I felt it in my gut. Dad didn't come home until later that night. I just went back to drinking and monopoly, trying to remain ignorant. I asked where he was and was lied to. More drinking and more monopoly. Finally, I get a call before class the next day. My last chance to see you alive. Why alive? Nobody could find the do-not-resuscitate forms. The hospital was required to put you on life support. You'd been on that kitchen floor for 5 hours. Evidenced by your uneaten meal on the table that you had at the same time every day like clockwork. Repeated counts of low sodium when you were alive. Low sodium leads to brain damage. No oxygen for five hours and constantly low sodium means brain dead. You were a twisted, grunting, shell of your former self. Fuck. That's who I get to say goodbye to? Where is my Oma? I want my Oma. Not this fucking demon that she left me with. Everyone is around me. What am I gonna do, cry? Nope. We all saw this coming. Just move on. Get it over with and move on. Clearly that hasn't worked because I'm still typing. Tears getting on my trackpad fuckign pissing me off making my computer do weird shit. Guess I'm gonna save this edit. Let the world see my ramblings. Maybe I'll delete it in the morning. Probably won't even read it beforehand. Too painful. Time to move on. Time to forget again. 20 years old and I don't think she will ever know the man I've become. She'll never realized how much I've changed. She'll never see me get married. She wasn't around when I started having a career. I have a job. I go to college. I've got a gig doing wifi installations. They want me to be their guy for this area. I should be happy. I'm doing everything right. This is what I've always wanted. I'm making progress. I'm not a bum.

You'd be so proud. I love you, Oma. More than you'll ever know, because you're fucking dead."

"You think the child being sick was the sad part of that?

For me the sad part is that even when being caught in the grips of addiction she loved and cared enough about her child to put aside worry about herself and try to do the right thing.

And the sadder part is that for most people that part doesn't matter. She's a junkie and that's all most people would see. "
"My husband and I have been married only 5 years. I know that's not long but we always get compliments from our single friends about how good we are together. We usually invite our (usually single male) friends over for dinner. Our good buddy commented while watching us cook ""look at you guys, it's like you're one person with 4 hands!"" 

Just some tips I have:
Always go to bed at the same time, if your schedule allows of course. We have weekends off together so we usually get up at the same time too.... this sometimes isn't the case as I sometimes like to sleep in later than him. But we always go to bed at the same time. 

Your partner needs to be your friend. You have to do fun things together. A lot of marriages with our families/friends make ""ball n chain"" jokes about their spouses. That just puts me off. 

Both of you should put the toilet seat down

This is how we handle chores. In the winter when he doesn't have to mow, he vacuums and I dust. In the summer, since our yard is somewhat small by the time he finishes mowing he comes in and I already have half the vacuuming done so then I start dusting and he finishes vacuuming and we get done pretty much at the same time. I've never mowed and he's never dusted. Except he did dust for me when his work was slow and he had more free time than me. 

Whoever doesn't cook has to do the dishes

We both do the laundry. It's whoever gets to it first. That's one of the ""chores"" we have when we get home from work. Put the dishes away, do the dishes (usually just our cups from the night before), start/fold laundry. Do the chores for our pets. 

We have shared checking/savings accounts. Since I'm better at money I'm in charge of checking them and moving money around and paying bills and also telling him what our balance is and if we need to be more mindful of our spending. Since I have to do that, he always calls internet/cable companies/take cars to get oil changed. Stuff like that. It's a trade off. 

Don't talk shit or talk about your fights/problems with ANYONE...unless it's a counselor obviously. 

Basically, I try to see it as ""what can I do to make his life easier."" Since he gets home from work before me, if I have time in the morning, I try to do some stuff that I think might be waiting for him when he gets home. "

"Not a dumpster diver, but a employee at a self-storage company. 

One Sunday, I saw two men throwing out all the goods in their unit in the garbage. It looked like all old vintage furniture. If they abandon the stuff after giving the key back from their unit, they have given it to the public. I was very intrigued. I went to see, all 1910 to 1950 furniture and documents. 

Upon going through everything, I found a binder. This was the most valuable piece in the whole dumpster, it was a priceless binder with information from WWII.

Some of the documents included (but not limited to):

- a telegram stating their boy has died in battle, dated 1941.

- pictures of the Canadian soldiers before going to war.

- money given by the government for war efforts.

These pieces of history were PRICELESS.

At first, I wanted to bring to the War Museum of Canada, but my mother thought that finding the family to which it belonged to was better. I thought to myself, ""why? They threw it out"" but my mom thought that it might have been a distant relative.

My mom found the original owner of these documents, she lived in Alberta, and goddamnit she was right, it was a distant relative who threw it out because they hated their family. 

We UPS it to her, and the original owner cried when getting it. She was happy. Her family was elated.

It seems like nigh-on everyone has praises upon praises to sing for the guy, but every film of his that I've seen has felt *exactly the same*. The pacing is always identical, the characters are always two-dimensional placeholders, and the stories – even when they're stolen from foreign films – feel like they're being told by a first-year filmmaker who *will not shut up* about all the *thought* that he put into it.

""Do you see this?"" every movie says. ""Do you see? I'm telling a story! Look at this! Look, look! Did you see how exciting that was? Okay, now, watch this part, this is going to be cool!""

Everything just comes across as being so heavy-handed and predictable, like watching a high-budget puppet show with Tarantino doing all of the voices. He has one character, one story, and one overall tone – a melody for the movie, if you will – and I just don't like it at all.

She she went all Mama Bear on his ass slap the shit out of him and the gun ends up underneath the car he ends up running away. He threatens a lawsuit against the federal government because the records should have not been given. I told him I would not hire him under any circumstances. If he can't get a set of car keys away from a woman holding a baby with a gun in his hand then how can I trust him with any responsibility at all.

I turn back around and go count again. I go toward the back to grab milk one more time. When I come out with the milk, this guy I'd never seen before in my life completely blows up on me.

You used to be able to get a job during the summer, but now if you want to go anywhere in life it is expected that you do these internships which are just companies using you for free labor.

Additionally, it cuts down the number of people that companies hire, because they can just get their free interns to do it instead.  If the internships were called anything else, they would be slavery."

"There's an interesting economics game theory like that. Consider the following situation: You see a watch you really like at the store and it costs $60. You look on your phone and see a store 15 minutes away has the exact same watch for $20. Most people would drive to save the $40. 

However let's say you saved up money and was looking to buy a new car with cash. The dealership you're at now has the one you want for $18,699. You also see a dealership 15 minutes away has the exact same one for $18,659. Would you drive 15 minutes to save $40? This is of course assuming you couldn't just haggle it down. Most people will say no, it's not worth it, despite being exactly the same amount of savings. Most people cite the relative savings but this is unintuitive because $40 extra in your wallet is $40 no matter how look at it."

"Many moons ago I worked in a gun store. I have a lot of these stories from there, but we'll go with this one. Guy comes in with a friend and the friend decides to purchase a handgun. He's got a pistol purchase permit and state ID, so his salesman started the paperwork. During the transaction, the guy doing the paperwork took money from his friend to pay for the handgun. The salesman sees it and comes to me for advice. By Federal law, this could be considered a straw purchase, because it now appears the guy is buying the gun but the friend is claiming it is for him.
Now, we never questioned our salesmen when they wanted to stop a sale. The reason didn't matter, we immediately backed them up on stopping the sale, because they can see things others can't. So he came to me to tell me he was stopping the sale on suspicion of a straw purchase. I was the assistant manager at the time, but my immediate supervisor was the general manager, so I handled all floor sales issues. 
I walk back to the table with the salesman to back him up when he stopped the sale. The friend, who was doing the paperwork, was visibly upset, but didn't argue. The guy who passed the money completely lost it. He began screaming and hollering and cursing. Both left the store. Five minutes later, he comes back in the store wanting to talk to a manager. When I tell him I am the manager, he lost it even harder. He starts screaming and waving a purchase permit in my face, that was apparently his as he claimed, but I couldn't read it with him waving it around. Now, I'm not a small girl, but this dude easily had a foot in height and about 100 lbs. on me. So he thought he was intimidating me. He tells me he wants to talk to me immediate boss. 
Boss man comes out... he's a Marine who tops the scales on this dude, even. He looks at the guy, looks at me (and I had ""the face"" displayed) and he says, ""Nah, you're good, she's got this."" And vanishes. 
Now the guy is so angry he's speaking in a high pitched voice. My customers are all stopped and watching this go down. The dude decides to start hitting things, so I casually reached up and got him by the back of the neck and walked him out of the store. That was a hell of a walk of shame for him because the customers all started clapping and mocking him for being bested by a woman (of course). "

Eh, I actually have never SEEN a fursuit in person. I don't know anybody who owns one, either? A decent looking suit is crazy expensive and a lot of work to maintain, so most furries don't bother with them. Some survey a few years back recorded that only like 10% of furs go suiting.

A lot of us find fursuits creepy too, actually. Something about vacant, unblinking eyes and an exaggerated expression is just so hard to look at. I never liked those cartoony costumes at theme parks for that reason, either, and most of my furry friends feel similarly. We just get desensitized to them due to being in the community and seeing so many pictures of popular suiters.

"Not a manager. Have never been a manager. But this story is a proud moment for me. 

I was a lifeguard at the local rec facility from 17-21 (summers and winter break when I was in college). All posted pool rules indicated that lifeguards were empowered to use their own judgment about pool activities and shut down anything that was too unsafe at any time. People mostly respected us. 

One day I was guarding near the lazy river and had to jump in to save a little boy who was going under. He was four and not wearing a life jacket. When he and I got out of the pool (him crying hysterically), his mother (who was not swimming herself) rushed over and started yelling at me. ""He was fine, what is your problem?!"" I told her ""Ma'am, he can't swim and the water is deeper than he is tall. The lazy river is full of people and it's simply not safe for him there.""

I started filling out the accident report (required every time a rescue occurred) and she kept bitching at me and tried to leave the scene several times. I told her that under no circumstances was the boy to return to the lazy river-- he could only go in the kiddie pool, and only with a life jacket (which we provided!). The mom demanded to speak to my manager so I knocked on the office door. ""Joe,"" former lifeguard, came out. It was literally his first day on the job as manager after training. Super chill guy, he took stock of the situation and said ""What /u/Laurasaur28 says goes."" Lady flipped out and said ""I've seen you before, you're only a lifeguard, not a manager!"" And he said ""As of today, I actually am"" and shut the door in her face."

"I'm not a teacher, but this is cringeworthy. 

My friend got a call from her 14 year old son's teacher. She and his dad were to meet with the teacher and the principal before their son could return to school. No excuses. 

Their kid had been jerking off in class, in the front row of the classroom!!! He always wore sweat pants. He refused to wear anything else, even though he never played a sport a day in his life. 

The teacher explained that she had noticed him doing this, and dismissed the class. She said she told him she was going to erase the chalkboard and he better be gone when she turned around. 
He was. But that was only one incident. There had been three others. 

He got detention, and was banned from wearing anything but jeans to school for the rest of the school year. Since school was over in three weeks, they allowed him to stay. But he had to go to the principals office for his classes. At the end of the school year, he was expelled. They ended up putting him in a charter school.

"No issue is so serious that it is beyond humor; however, the situation and environment in which jokes about serious topics are acceptable is much more rare than more vanilla jokes.

For instance, I believe comedians, when on stage, can pull of jokes about rape because everyone in the room has an understanding, before entering, that the content is for mature audiences and that any humor derived by a serious issue is done in a way that pokes fun at the topics absurdity, irony, or is attained via shock value.

To see a perfect example of a horribly unacceptable rape joke, look no further than [Duerte](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/899984/duterte-vows-all-out-support-for-troops-fighting-terrorists-then-cracks-rape-joke).

But some rapey things can be sorta funny in an immature way, like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=raunchy+rape+joke&amp;client=ms-android-google&amp;prmd=vin&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUodXXuJvVAhXD7D4KHb3LD0IQ_AUICigC&amp;biw=684&amp;bih=332&amp;dpr=2.63#imgrc=Z-XzCLGm6aLN6M:), or when taken out of context like [this](

"Unless the dog is terrified of being inside. When I was young, we had a dog that came off the streets (actually, started hanging around our house and we fed it leftovers and one day a police officer came and told us we needed a fence for ""our dog"" so my parents spent quite a few grand on a wrought iron fence around our yard so she became ""our dog"") and was probably severely abused (terrified of men, including our dad, for the longest time) and refused to come into the house, even in the dead of winter. We tried dragging her inside several times and it ended up with her shaking in a corner swallowing her uncontrollable drool and then vomiting it up from fear.

She had to have surgery when she was pretty old so we forced her inside for about three weeks while she healed (in like a gated in area) but after that, she was okay and wasn't terrified anymore, although she did prefer staying outside if given the choice though but would obey the ""come"" command if called.

Prior to that we used to get the police called on us every winter because good meaning Samaritans would see the dog outside--and every time the police officers would come, see the covered kennel in the backyard with sheepskin and blankets in the dog house, and we'd have to explain why the dog refused to come inside.

Thinking about how hard her early life must have been makes me tear up. She once disappeared from our yard a few months after the fence was built and we thought she went home--two weeks later she showed up with a rope around her neck that was chewed through (guess her previous owners lived nearby and saw her or something). That was the day we knew she was our dog."

Woah things are getting heated down there. I just want to point out that I was absolutely rubbish at the vegan diet and I'm not trying to say I am in anyway a good representative of the vegan lifestyle. This diet just was to difficult to sustain with my lifestyle of school and work etc and so despite my best efforts at sustaining i had to give up unless I wanted to enjoy the thrills of really bad anaemia.

"I just don't think there's anything mysterious or paranormal about people getting lost in the wilderness. Anyone who spends enough time in nature knows how vast and dangerous it is.

Nothing spooky about a storm halting or impeding a search and rescue mission. Animals will pick your corpse clean and leave nothing behind for people to find too.

"Same with the black bears here too. I can't tell you how many tourist i see feeding the black bears at wekiva state park. And then they have the nerve to get mad at you for telling them that they shouldn't do that. I saw this lady who was feeding two cubs on one of the trails, i told her she should stop, she didn't and said that it wasn't a problem to feed them because they were baby's and the baby's wouldn't attack her. Yea the baby's aren't going to kill you the momma who's behind the bush will. The problem is people have no respect for animals nowadays. People are so desensitized from what animals even are nowadays that they cant get over the fact that a bear or a gator or a snake actually can kill you.

That there was a point in my life that I could dream things in to existence. I dreamed of a super soaker (the first one with the pump thing and big green water tank) and I woke up to find it in my toy box. Then another time I dreamed about a poster of Ozzie Smith and I found it rolled up in my closet the next morning. I remember my parents asking me where I got the poster which means it has to be a false memory right? I remember dreaming a couple other things in to existence too but I still have the poster and super soaker.

"Saying the word ""soldier"". 

I thought it was pronounced ""sol-der"". Nobody misunderstood me when I said it and was never corrected. 

Then in a public speaking class in my second year of university we were doing tongue twisters and we had to say ""shoulder soldier"" repeatedly as fast as we could. I found it really easy. 

The teacher assistant told me that I was doing it wrong. He started correcting me and told me it was pronounced sol-jer. I didn't know what the hell he was talking about. I thought it was a joke or that he was an idiot. 

I started to stupidly argue it and my friends took my side (but they thought I was kidding). The professor came and asked me if I was serious and then showed me clips of people saying the word ""soldier"". I have now learnt to use the word correctly and can't believe that nobody had corrected me beforehand. "

"When I was a teen, my mom made me sign up for this babysitting course, and then volunteered me to watch some of my cousins’ kids (less than 1 year old, crawling not walking).

So, I had a lot of Fridays and weekends that I’d spend watching a kid instead of doing shit I wanted to be doing.

Her plan backfired, because I actually learned about the responsibility and reality of raising a kid, and realized that it sucked ass giving up things I wanted to be doing to take care of a screaming blob of blankets, tiny clothes, and diapers.

"I went to a funeral for a cousin two days ago. She had killed herself by ODing on a cocktail of drugs and booze. She was 38, and left 6 kids, the youngest was 3 or 4. I didn't actually know her well; her mother is largely estranged from the family, and she was something like a 5th or 6th cousin. 

Most of the song list chosen was about getting wasted and partying. Her brother called her a pain in the ass. Even the preacher who did the service said this was the first time in more than 40 years that he had ever seen such behavior at the funeral. 

Mind you, this woman killed herself with drugs and booze. She was 38, but she looked like she was a woman in her 60's desperately trying to relive her glory days with a ton of makeup and badly dyed hair. She looked horrible even by the standards of being dead. She looked older than my grandfather did when he died, and he was 79 and had a massive heart attack followed by a two week coma before dying. There were not only children there but very small children listening to songs about getting wasted and partying and how great it is. 

I lay my pets to rest with more respect than this poor woman got from her own mother. Who now has custody of all 6 kids (the father had died of cancer some years ago, which set off the mother's spiral of drug and alcohol abuse). 

About the only thing that was respectful was her oldest three daughters singing an acapella version of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"". That was beautiful. Everything else was horrible. I wanted to backhand someone more then than at any time in my life.   "

"For every proverb there is another, with exact opposite meaning"
"Yes, it is! It refers to the seemingly impossible task of getting a computer to load its operating system when its memory is empty at power-on. If the memory is empty, what code is loading the operating system?

The answer is that there is a small bit of code built into the computer that is capable of loading a slightly larger piece of code from the disk, and that piece of code is capable of loading an even larger piece of code from the disk, and that piece of code is capable of loading the operating system. It is these stages (the exact number of which may vary from system to system) that reminded someone of the bootstraps idiom, and it stuck.

In modern computers, there is actually a fair bit of software in the computer's ROM or flash memory, so this isn't as mysterious as it used to be. I mean, the fricking BIOS on my new HP Zbook supports a mouse, for God's sake. But once upon a time, memory was expensive.

In an Apple II, to choose an example with which I am extremely familiar, booting went like this. The computer's main ROM does not know anything about disk drives, so the bit of code that actually does the initial loading resides on the floppy disk controller. The main ROM (called the Monitor) scans the ROMs on the expansion cards looking for one with a signature indicating it is bootable, locates the disk controller, and executes that code. The disk controller ROM's code reads track 0, sector 0, which uses the disk controller's code to load the rest of track 0. Track 0 contains (in DOS 3.3) most of a routine called RWTS, Read/Write Track/Sector, which is capable of operating the drive at a low level. Among its capabilities, it has code to move the drive's read/write head to a track other than 0. This allows the rest of the disk operating system to be read from the next two tracks. The full disk operating system understands how files are organized, so can then load the application program stored on the disk.

In ProDOS (the successor to DOS 3.3) the code initially loaded from disk has enough smarts to actually locate the PRODOS file on the disk and load it. It has some filesystem knowledge, in other words, allowing the OS to be just another file on the disk rather than stored in a nonstandard fashion outside the user-accessible space. To fit this into 512 bytes, as ProDOS does, while also supporting other kinds of devices (DOS 3.3 supported only 5¼"" floppies natively) and also taking into account the fact that the disk controller ROM only loads the first half of the ProDOS boot code on 5¼"" floppies (a 5¼"" disk sector is 256 bytes while ProDOS deals in 512-byte blocks, so the first half of the boot block needs to load the second half, in addition to the other things it does) is nigh miraculous.

[Here is a commented disassembly](http://apple2.org.za/gswv/a2zine/GS.WorldView/Resources/DOS.3.3.ANATOMY/BOOT.PROCESS.txt) of the 6502 code involved in booting an Apple II into DOS 3.3.

On many older systems, booting the machine required entering a bootstrap loader manually each time you booted it!"

For example, I posted about a story of a girl I saw having a very serious reaction to drugs. Id say at least half of the replies were people calling her a stupid bitch and hoping that she would die. And a lot of those comments were heavily upvoted. I have been on reddit  long enough to know that if it was a man, I have absolutely no doubt that there would be no direct reference to his gender. I'm all for responsible drug use but it was shocking to me that this was so accepted to hold a woman's identity as a major source of criticism of her decisions.

I confidently described him as my mom went more and more pale. It turned out I had just given her the perfect description of her dad who passed away before I was born. At that time, I had never seen a single picture of him and when my mom showed me one, I could confirm that this was the man in the living room. I still remember it. You could see all the details of the face and clothing. He even held a book that was a huge characteristic to my granddad which my mom had never told me before. The reason why I called him the rainbow man was because he was surrounded en beautiful, very strong rainbow-coloured light. "

"Even then they're bloody wrong.

And then bam, two cases last year.  They make out Africa to be some hell hole of millions of shanty towns when the real issue is a lack of clean water and steady education. 

And *then*, there were measles outbreaks in Europe last year (continuing into this year) and clustered outbreaks across the US, Australia, and NZ. Three guesses why 😒 

No, measles *might not* kill your kid, but it *can* and *will* if they aren't already healthy. Not so much the issue, the real killer is these outbreaks were mostly in denser areas such as SanFran, and with dense population comes more elderly, very young, and those with compromised immune systems (me). 

Hep A and B, HPV, *Diptheria*. They might not kill you, because you can dial 911/999/111 but boy, they'll fuck your shit up for the rest of your life.

"I think I have posted this somewhere in a similar thread but.

I have always enjoyed the thought of ghosts and stuff but never really believed firmly. I liked it just enough that it was entertaining but not scary.

So a friend of mine had this long-standing ghost story of the ""bunny man"" at her dads house. A maybe 8 foot tall shadow figure with ""bunny ears"" (or horns) that she saw often in the woods by her dads house as a child, and spoke enough about that her dad and sister teased her about it into adulthood. Her parents were separated so she lived with her mom after the age of 10, and wasn't at her dads house often enough for this ghost story to really persist. A few incidents at sleepovers, but nothing big.

When we were newly 20 years old, we both moved back in with our parents to save some money and pay some bills. She and her mom didn't get along, so her dad gladly invited her to live with him in his house by the woods. She gladly accepted. Of course her decision to move in brought up the bunny man, which we had a laugh about and moved on.

I helped her move her stuff, because I owned a big car and why not.

Immediately sketchy things started to happen while we were moving in stuff. We would put things places, and ten minutes later they would be somewhere else. At some point she put her purse inside while we were moving furniture, and we lost it. We found it... In my car? But whatever, explainable. But the more it happened the more we began to kind freak out. As we moved the last load of the night out of my car, it was dark. The outside lights, motion detected, flickered on and off while we were inside.

We went back to my car, unsettled and ready to go back home and be done packing for the day. We get in, we turn on the lights.

On my windshield, as plain as day, is a huge elongated handprint, as an angle as though someone was on top of my car when they pressed it.

I can't stress to you how alone we were at the house. It's literally in the woods, far from anything. Her dad wasn't even home, he's a trucker and was gone for a few weeks while we moved her in. We hadn't put that handprint there.

Both of us froze, unable to speak. After a moment I reached up and touched it. It came off. It was inside the windshield.

I wipe it away and started to drive off, pretty spooked. But my friend started to straight up cry. She's a pretty stoic person, I think I have seen her cry maybe twice and this is one of the times.

She only lived there about 4 months in between houses but it was a weird few months. If we started talking about ""the bunnyman"" too long something would happen. Lights would go off, or turn on. Things would fall off shelves. We would hear tapping on windows.  If we were having a fire in the yard, the fire would spark and pop.

We never felt settled there. Im amazed she slept there because the few nights I stayed in the guest bedroom, it was so hard to sleep. Just an overarching feeling of dread.

Very quiet part of the woods too. Not a lot of bird sounds, not a lot of wildlife. Lots of weird shit happening in general; stuff going missing, stuff falling for no reason. At some point my boyfriend at the times back window was broken with no possible suspects. Our other friend swore on her life she saw a shadow man in the woods one night, and from then on out needed to be walked to her car from the house.

Anyway, no real big specific incidents but enough accumulating things that we knew it was haunted. My old broke down car is there currently, because I had no place really to store it. So in two weeks I get to go visit while I get my car towed. Maybe i'll have another bunnyman experience."

"Because everyone needs to buy a mattress at some point. If you buy a mattress every decade, that's 120 months. If you live near 120 households, that's sales of one mattress per month, and I figure you probably live near more people than that. Some houses have more than one bed. Maybe it's a shared house, maybe they have kids. Mattresses aren't cheap to buy, so by serving a large enough area, they can have a relatively good income."

It's common to have a group of girls to scout out a party. Use that to your advantage as 5 dollars to get into a party for a kicked keg is one way to ruin your night.

Carry around a lighter. Someone always needs a lighter.

If you never drank alcohol before, then take it easy the first time you do it. The amount of freshmen who get carted off the first week of school is startling.

**Academics**

First impressions in a class is really important. Syllabus week (which you should never skip) determines whether or not the class is worth staying. 

Search for your textbook online first. I found all of my math textbooks online and haven't had the need to spend a lot of money. 

You're gonna procrastinate. It's gonna suck to do work last minute. Try to mitigate the damage of procrastination as much as you can.

**Misc**

Fingers crossed that your roommate isn't crazy. Situations vary from person to person. I hope your problem solving skills are on point.

Before classes start, go explore the campus so you know where your classes are. It sucks being late on the first day of school.

My favorite tip to do is to have my class schedule as my phone wallpaper. I know when and where are my classes and how long it'll be for my break.

Speaking of breaks, if you have an hour or more break between classes, try to avoid going home/dorm. Use the time to go over your notes you just took or prepare for your next class.

I hope these tips were useful. Freshman year was really interesting and exciting for me. Best of luck surviving"

"It could be a communications repeater station. If a unit on the East Coast needed to talk to someone on the West Coast when normal communications were down, a ham radio could bridge the gap, and the center would act as a repeater. Many railroads do this as well: they'll have a central dispatch center in the middle of the country, allowing them to communicate with field units via radio or microwave link.

It's probably also a continuity location: the offices on the coast are vulnerable to natural disasters and attacks, but Kansas is in the middle of the country and you'd need to throw a long-range ICBM at it to have any chance of reaching it. 

On top of all that, the land is probably real cheap and it's just used as a support office."

"A gaming PC. I had a shitty laptop from 2006-ish that I had to maintain because my parents didn't want to drop money on a new one. I really wanted a gaming PC, graphics card and all, because all my friends had PCs with l337 specs and wanted to be part of that group. Though I still kicked their asses in LoL even with my spooty laptop! It was very common to hear this in a match:

Me: ""Ah shit I'm lagging again.""
Friends: ""[My name]... Get a new PC.""
Me: ""Hey man, this laptop is crappy but I can still beat you in a 1v1!""

So I got myself a part time job in highschool senior year to freshman year of college and bought myself $1000 worth of PC parts. I was ecstatic to build my first rig! 

And then when it was finally operational I couldn't help but feel my heart sink when I realized I drop $1000 just to play LoL in HD, basically. 

I also couldn't get into a lot of Steam games. My friends would tell me games like DayZ were fun or any game that would push my PC to its limits would be fun. But nah, those games were all graphics with very unintuitive controls and very grindy and lackluster gameplay. 

Unpopular opinion I'm sure and downvotes will happen. Come what may. 

Edit: On a side note, building a PC was very much enjoyable for me! The experience actually using it felt no different than my old laptop. It's just the graphics were prettier."

I do feel there is a degree if Cindarella effect in this family (step parent abuse) to Cody, and the Dad went along with it.

There is a video they once filmed where they are taking 4 of the kids to Disney world, Cody can't go as he was 'naughty'. They *film* this. In the video Cody is trying to be accepting and put on a brave face, and the Dad is constantly reminding him ""so we're all going, remember, you aren't!"" Then at the end it's the stepmother filming the Dad. He is upset that Cody isn't going (as if this is somehow out of his control). And she's all 'I'm not, I'm glad. He'd spoil the day. There's something *wrong* with that kid.' Maybe he acts up because you fucking *torture* him.

It infuriates me that they *continue* to film themselves, portraying themselves as victims of some horrible mistake. You think you'd quiety disappear in shame, but no. They are so deluded."

"This would be a fun legal case. Realistically, you could assume that it was poisoning, however, Eric was free to do whatever he wanted with his gatorade. The person who stole it, was well, stealing and consuming. Eric could have argued in court that he intended to drink the gatorade himself, since it was his. The other kid would have to admit to theft in order to attempt to prove intentional poisoning by Eric. If you add up the costs of the gatorade, it could amount to at least a misdemenor. But he would have no grounds to prove intentional poisoning. Eric didn't directly hand him the gatorade for him to drink. Basically, its a pretty good way to do it. 

I would have to call it the Dread Pirate Roberts defense. He poisoned both drinks, knowing he was immune, so a similar situation."

But I'm all I've got. I'm the vehicle through this whole life thing that I want so much to experience, so I try to live with myself even when it feels unbearable. 

When I was younger, I externalized what was essentially an internal problem. Instead of just having depression, I viewed the world through the lens of depression. It wasn't that I was depressed, it was that the world was ugly, life pointless, efforts futile. This was disastrous because not only was I in pain, but I wasn't allowing myself to see anything worth suffering for. Now, I'm still depressed, but I understand it better as something that comes from inside me and that has allowed me to see more clearly."

We sat at the top of my driveway for about 5 minutes with the headlights on until finally a man jumped out of the ditch in front of our house and took off running into the woods. I still have no idea how my Dad saw this guy as it was very dark outside.

For clarification my Dad wasn't one for talking, so we sat there for 5 minutes in silence. I never asked what we were doing (I didn't really ask him many questions) so it was a super weird experience to say the least."
"I hate one of my best friends wife. 

We are all in our late 20's (almost 30's). People have family's and jobs. We don't get to hang out as much as we did when we were in our teens or early 20's. 

Every few times a year maybe we hang out. Each time his Wife is always calling, nagging him when he is out for more than a couple of Hours. Saying stuff like ""I heard something outside!"" Or ""Our baby can't sleep without you here.""

She also, I think, turned him against me. He has been distant, withdrawn. Only texts when he needs something. 

He helped me move last year. I don't really have family around to help. So he and a couple of friends helped. She found a reason to stop by during the move to yell at him
For something. I said hi to her, but she was pissed. 

I bumped into her at Target a few months later.  She asked how the new place was and was very passive aggressive in saying ""oh well we MOVED ourselves when we moved"" (into a house they had lived in for a few years).

No they didn't. They had the help of her family and his. I know because I offered to help but my friend turned me down because he said they already had 10 people helping. 

Anyway, I started a new job a year ago. Great place. Making more money than I ever have. One of the last times we hung out my friend asked what they started me at and I told him. He is one of my best friends and it was just the two of us. It didn't seem odd to tell him. 

This last 4th of July was the last time I saw them. They showed up to a mutual friends BBQ that also happens to live a block away from friends wife's mom and dads so they made an appearance. She was tipsy. 

At first things seemed okay. She was acting like she used to before they were married and we were all friends. I started to feel like I misread the previous target incident. 

Then she started saying that my girlfriend and I Should have kids. I told her no (she knows we plan on never having kids). She then started saying how i should and it's not fair that I make as much as I do and not have children. 

The fact that she knows how much money I make means that my friend told her. She then goes on to say that it's not fair they put themselves through school and worked hard and I just got my job handed to me (which is not true at all). 

I think he, or she, or both of them, resent that I make what I do. 

They are both college educated, he is a veteran. They have two kids. I dropped out of college, I don't have kids. I never served. And I make more money than they do and probably ever will in their careers (Teacher, Local government work). 

I know my friend. This would have never bothered him before. But I get the feeling she has been playing it into his mind that I shouldn't deserve what I have and that they should have that. 

And that makes me resent her. "

Now keep in mind it's pitch black outside. So I ready myself and jump. I feel the little hitch he was talking about but something isn't right. As I conclude that something indeed isn't right, it feels like I get hit with a pickup truck in the back. I was falling about 25' without even knowing and landed perfectly on my back in about one and a half feet of water (the rope snapped). Any other rotation would've left me severely injured or dead.

This leads to Tyrion's descent into deep depression and where he really starts to think some evil shit and it leads to Jaime finally seeing through Cersei's bullshit and doing what he can to get away from her. 

By cutting it from the show Tyrion never became the dark version of himself and just joked his way to Meereen and Jaime didn't start doubting Cersei until the very end of last season.  "

Take their knowledge, workforce, experience (trial and error) and the time it took into consideration and the pyramids are still impressive, but very doable."

~~Note for any impressionable youths reading: ""Pullout game"" is a joke. You do, in fact, pre-cum before orgasm, and although it's less risky than not pulling out, it's significantly more risky than a condom~~.

**After looking into it**, there is still more risk than condoms, but not significantly so; 2% on a properly used condom, 4% on a properly executed pull-out. Although the risk of the heat of the moment and mistakes included, I'd still say bring a condom if you don't have 200% faith in yourself/partner. Obviously, condoms for new partners and all that due to STD/STIs.

According to Planned Parenthood, [as linked in responses](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method/how-effective-is-withdrawal-method-pulling-out) to this comment, those relying on the pull-out method run at 27% failure rate; this is likely where the myth spread, and where I picked it up."

"Paid photo IDs, reduced registration and voting windows, closing polling stations or understaffing them in poor/Democratic areas, etc. In North Carolina they specifically targeted early voting windows that they analyzed and found were greatly preferred by black people who tend to vote Democrat. Like, they were caught red-handed doing it. Meanwhile, even Republicans admit that fraud with absentee ballots is much more rampant and easy to do, yet they take no steps to stop that. I'd be perfectly fine with photo IDs and verifying citizenship if Republicans made them really easy to obtain. As it is, there is often a provision that you can get the ID for free if you ask, but Republican state governments have been caught instructing DMV workers not to volunteer that info unless they are specifically asked. Then there's the fact that the person has to arrange transportation to the DMV (which can be a hardship), has to have all his documentation in order (may include SSN card, birth certificate, etc.) or go to another government building and pay a fee to have copies of these made and mailed to them (the fee there is not waivable AFAIK). All of these offices, including DMV, have limited hours. I don't know about your state, but in mine, they're open weekdays from 8:30-4:30, AKA working hours. If you want to stay on the rolls instead of having to re-register all the time, Republicans are making it so that you have to have a permanent address where you can reliably receive mail, which you consistently respond to in a timely manner, and that you vote in every election. Otherwise they're free to purge you and make you sign up again.

It might not seem like a big deal to an ordinary middle class person who had responsible parents, has a halfway decent job/car, a house or apartment, etc. But it can be a big deal for poor people who may already be despondent about their situation and the possibility for change by voting. Basic literacy tests and small poll taxes wouldn't seem like the biggest ""ask"" either if we didn't know the history of those measures."

"My husband was driving, I  was in the passenger seat, two kids in the back as we were driving 65 down a major highway on a Saturday afternoon. In front of us was a white Ford truck hauling an empty boat trailer.

They must have accidentally left a 2x4 on the trailer or didn't think about the danger because they, now going probably 70 or more MPH hit a bit of a bump and the 2x4 was lanched high up into the air. I watched in horror as it spun towards me as a high pitched sound went off in the car. Because of the way my seatbelt jerked when I tried to curl forward, I was unable to duck down. My only option was to put my arms protectivly over my head and bring my legs up.

Fortunately for me, my husband saw the beam launch from the trailer and was able to swerve out of the way. Fortunately, it was Saturday afternoon and there wasn't much traffic. 

The car avoided the flying 2x4 and we slowed down and pulled out of an exit and parked realized the high screeching alarm going off was coming from me. I took a deep breath. My life had flashed before me and I  was only alive because my husband saw the flying beam and was able to take action.

I doubt the truck driver was even remotely aware of what happened."

Their daughter was the nicest, most down to earth person I've ever known.

"Have you talked about this particular incident with your therapist?

I lost someone close to me as well, that I miss everyday. Whenever I feel down and despondent, I think about what he'd do. Once I did think about ending it, but he'd just be really disappointed in me, you know?

That I still have the gift of life and am wasting it by not even *trying* to be happy.

So now, every little accomplishment I get, I think of it as making him proud. I'm not saying it's easy, it's a tough tough road. And every setback makes me feel like I'm back at square 1. But, if you've gotten out of it once, you'll know that you are capable of being better. 

And that's huge."

"If you have a slow cooker.

Drumsticks: 2-3.5 lbs

Brown/wild rice.

Various greens (standard mirepoix, bell peppers in my opinion)

Mushrooms sauted in butter.

Some sort of bean.

Veggie broth

Peas

Directions:

Season and sear drums. Place in slow cooker. Saute greens. Add them too. Beans can go in whenever but I'm lazy so i do it at this point. Any seasonings and herbs you feel like adding. I like bay and oregano for this.


Cook on low for 3-4 hours.

Remove drums, shred meat, set aside the meat so it doesn't turn to mush.

Add rice to remaining veggie stew.
Let cook for 30-50 minutes until rice is about 80% done.

At this point, saute mushrooms in butter and add to pot. Let cook so the mushroom goodness can imbue the mix but not ruin the mushrooms.

When rice is done, add back in the meat and then add the frozen peas to chill.

Portion and store.

I get all my stuff from trade Joe's.


I don't have to portion because everything is pre packaged and measured.

You can get 10 550 calorie meals from this at about 1.70 a portion.

I don't add any salt to this because the partial ingredients have salt. This helps with my blood pressure.

"Every single time I played that game, I never even questioned helping him out. Butch was a stupid kid, but there were only so many people in 101 Vault and I wasn't going to let 20% of the adult population die just because of her asshole of a child. Plus he was so pathetic when he ran over to ask, and he did seem genuinely grateful when I saved his mom. So every time, I went in and shot those radroaches. 

Sometimes I'd have my baseball bat. Sometimes I'd steal whatever Butch had. However I did it, I'd get a sweet jacket and a thank you.

Until one time. When I accidentally whacked Butch's mom in the face.

This bitch was getting eaten alive, and in the process of my saving her, I *accidentally* brushed her on the head with a bat.

Butch. Flipped. *Out*.

I had no idea what was still attacking me 'til I noticed this guy wasn't saying thank you - and was, in fact, actively shanking me.

So I reloaded. I saved his mom. I freed him from the vault. I met up with him in Rivet City. I recruited him as my companion. I brought him to Vault 87.

And I left him there.

So somewhere in a save file, somewhere on my desktop, there's a version of Butch who's still waiting for me to get him out of that ghoul-filled, radiation-soaked hellscape.

And I ain't gonna. 

His one and only dream was to leave the vault, and he ain't gonna, either.

And that tiny victory has given me so much more satisfaction than ever not helping his mom, which I've still unflinchingly stepped up to do. And what do you know, the next time I whacked his mom in the head - maybe less accidentally - *that* Butch counted to ten, put this shit into perspective, let it go, gave me his jacket, and *fucking learned not to cross me.*

Best game ever.

But Comrade Slava be of interest in little green shape. Is never seen before. So he look more. Is apparently symbol of power from far away, in uncivilized culture that still practice cult of religion. The more Slava is of read about symbol, the more things happen.

Is sure is not neighbors that he spy on for Party as is speak in unknown, dead tongue. So Comrade Slava ask linguist who identify tongue as American. Conversation is talk about big sales today, up to 50% on select items.

Comrade start question sanity. He enlist help of KGB for he does not know who else to be of help. After KGB beat comrade Slava to a pulp for obtain answer, is reveal is been corrupted by virus of capitalism!

"Hey im moving in with my girl too this weekend! (Our first place-she has stayed at my current place the majority of the time for the last 3 years though) the biggest advice i can give you is split the work in your head 60/40, and if she cant do some work because of reasons, do it without her asking. Keep it clean and she will stay relaxed. May not work with yall as i dont know either of you or your relationship. But best of luck in your future endeavors, i hope you have found the person you wish to spend eternity with and if not that this person can bring you one step closer to finding that person. I wish you both peace andd happiness in the years to come, as well as patience and understanding in the rough patches, and joy and empathy during the good times."

"Worked as a tattoo artist a while back and this guy was a damn nightmare human (I have since had to quit due to health issues). I had to take some time off (again, health related) so in the mean time they got someone in to replace me. The guys portfolio was good, had been tattooing for 9 years already had a client base to bring with him. Unfortunately, the googling came a little too late.

The first few months were good but the guy slowly started getting lazy. Cancelling on clients, not showing up, booking clients in for full day sessions and after 2 hours of work he'd tell them their skin wasn't tolerating being tattooed/they were bleeding too much so could no longer continue. Instead of just charging for 2 hours he'd still charge the full day rate and then take off without breaking down his work station or would sit on his phone watching netflix for the rest of the day. He generally started getting lazy with wrapping his stuff and others working in the shop would be reminding him that these things need to be done properly. At this point I googled the guy and he'd posted on load of different tattoo sites begging for jobs all with conflicting information about his background like where he had worked previously and for how long. Something didn't add up so I brought it to the attention of the shop manager (who by this point had plenty of complaints about the guy) but they decided to give the benefit of the doubt and kept him around only asking him to improve on certain points. He did for a bit but then started only tattooing young girls 18/19 (it wouldn't surprise me if there were underage girls as well) and was giving discounts to these girls in return for sexual favours. When called out on it he ""quit"" and came back during the night when everyone had gone home and stole over £800 worth of machines, inks and other stuff, most of which belonged to me. 

Makes me mad just thinking about it.

"The Jabberwock

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
      And the mome raths outgrabe. 

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
      The frumious Bandersnatch!” 

He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
      Long time the manxome foe he sought— 
So rested he by the Tumtum tree 
      And stood awhile in thought. 

And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
      And burbled as it came! 

One, two! One, two! And through and through 
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 
He left it dead, and with its head 
      He went galumphing back. 

“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy! 
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” 
      He chortled in his joy.

"One of my first jobs was working as a cashier at a cheap pizza place. The only things they served was pizza and fries. Thus, there was a huge fryer towards the back of the place. It was really old and grimy and I was happy I didn't have to touch that thing. One day I am at my register minding my own business when my boss (who owned the place) introduces me to this sweet-looking girl approximately my age (16 or so at the time). I say hi and go back to my job. Then in about 20 minutes I hear a LOUD scream. Apparently she was fiddling with the fryer controls and managed to turn up the temperature, so boiling hot oil started spewing out of the machine and flying EVERYWHERE. Thankfully no one was standing next to it at the time so there were no victims, but the hot oil landed all over the place and made everything sticky, stinky and gross. The manager yelled at her and fired her on the spot. And we had to clean up the place. I think that was the moment I decided that going to college was a great idea after all so I don't have to deal with this shit till the end of days. "

"Had a few so will summarize them. Just so you know our school had a program that allows children with special needs to take classes in their supposed age + grade level. This would have been fine except our school sucked at managing kids with severe mental and learning disabilities which lead a lot more harm than good to those poor kids.

*  Boy who was possibly on some sort of autism spectrum. He would spit on the floor and roll in it (he was 13) and would flick his boogers or stuck it at girls hair or start salivating and chase your around.   

*  Me.  Apparently liking anime and  being poor made me the outcast.

*  HS Classmate who got expelled-  He poked me with a safety pin just to see how I would react. Threw once a football directly at me for no reason.  Then lit a firecracker at the school lockers then picked a fight with the homeroom teacher.  We think this was his way of rebelling as he was a transfer and he hated our school.

* Typical Creepy Geek HS classmate- He was into a lot of Warcraft and Diablo...not really a big issue but he uses it too much to try to bond with ppl with no interest with it.  What made him weird is that EVERY DAMN CLASS he needs to always debate with our teachers with one of those "" WHY?!"" questions. Our class has protested against him several times bec he literally disrupts our lessons and if we call him out on it he says that we bully him.   He also gave out that creepster vibe esp with the girls. (cant disclose reasons on fear of exposing his and mine identities)

* Another Classmate who is forever stuck being in HS mentality.  He was not bullied but he was a bit of an outcast for being weird and crushing weirdly on one of the girls.  15 years later thats ALL he ever wants to talk about and gets very bitter about it. If you try to change the topic with him he gets annoyed and accuses you as the one who hasnt moved on. He still harbors feelings for his HS crush who has now started her own family. He has not married.  I have since refrained from speaking with him.  He's in MY FB and he works as a college school admin last I checked.

*  College I had a classmate who back in college was a closeted gay guy. However before he came out he aggressively flirted with girls, me included but his actions came in as creepy and perverse.  In swim class he tried to touch the girls genital areas and say it was an accident. During a camp trip he came onto one of our openly gay classmate, when he refused he forever held a grudge on that guy to this day. He stalks that persons Instagram and keeps begging us on dirt on him.  We had a planned reunion with everyone since Year One, created a FB group chat and invited everyone we knew.  He called out a girl he hasnt spoken to in 10 years bec she moved out of the country in Year 2 and called her names and accused her of bullying.  This guy was just super bitter and angry and just loved to put others down.  I refuse to go out in mini get togethers when he is around because I actually like to keep my life private."

At the age of 25 Alex quit his job and drove to Florida in search of something better. He traded his old minivan for a small sailboat he found on Craigslist. Alex taught himself how to sail with the help of a 'Sailing For Dummies' book. On New Years Eve 2008 Alex set sail from Florida with 2 friends, and headed towards the Bahamas, never looking back. What followed was a 4 year adventure that took Alex to the farthest corners of the globe. Alex's relentlessness and appetite for risky behavior made for a grand adventure every American boy once dreams of - but at what cost? 'Chasing Bubbles' is the story of one man's search for fulfillment by pushing everything in his world to the absolute limit."

"Rachel Antonio - [this is the podcast about her disappearance (there's no Wikipedia)](http://www.couriermail.com.au/rachelantoniopodcast) 

She went missing on ANZAC Day 1998 in my hometown (Bowen, Queensland, Australia). Her parents dropped her at the cinema to see Good Will Hunting but she didn't go to the movie. Her last sighting was on Queens Beach, a block from the movie cinema, and then nothing. 

The investigation led the police to Robert Hytch, her surf lifesaving captain. Her diaries say they were in a relationship, but he has always denied it. They found her blood in the boot of his car which he could not explain, but to this day they have found nothing else. He was charged with her murder and found guilty, but was released on appeal due to the lack of evidence. Recently the coroner found him responsible for her death, he is appealing this also. 

Bowen is a small town. He still lives there, as do her parents. They have likely run across each other at the supermarket. It's kinda fucked up. 

My theory after listening to the podcast? He did it and his family helped cover it up, and they've gotten away with it. The police are currently searching the garbage dump to try to find evidence. Fingers crossed they finally find something. "

"For me, *that* conversation started with him asking, ""Are you still attracted to me?"" I lied and said, ""Of course darling,"" expecting the subject to drop. He said, ""I don't know, you seem really detached."" 

""Oh, you know, that project has been keeping me super busy lately, I've just been a little overwhelmed."" 

""No,"" he said. ""It's been longer than that.""

I stopped and took a deep breath and realised that I could either commit to the lie and gaslight him into oblivion, convincing him that everything his gut was telling him was wrong, only to prove it right at a later date. Or, come clean now. 

I took a deep breath and said, ""Can we please sit down? There's something I need to tell you.""

"Welp, I was doing alright in this thread up until I looked this up.

&gt;Lars is seen on the airport security cam walking into the airport with a red and black backpack and carrying a large duffel bag in his right hand. He’s wearing a yellow short-sleeved shirt and jean shorts. He stops and talks to a woman. It appears he’s asking her something, perhaps how to get to Medical Services. After he arrives at Medical Services, he spends about 45 minutes there.

&gt;An unknown male walked into Medical Services dressed like a construction worker. When Lars saw this man, he became anxious, mumbled something to the doctor, then sprinted out of the airport leaving his luggage and backpack behind. He lightly jogged across the parking lot and scaled a fence. He continued running out of camera’s view. Lars disappeared after that, and has not been seen since. Lars had no history of mental illness.

"Well, that and there are other logistical issues with this idea.

Visit Washington, DC and notice the grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, apartment buildings, things that are ordinary parts of living in a city. There are people who work in a capital city who have NO connection to the government but who are necessary to the functioning of the city. You're going to always have a year round population in a capital city whose lives are dependent on the function of but yet have no daily interaction with the federal government. A city collapses without its support. 

Since there IS a year round population, children will be born and educated there, they'll need schools. Maybe one of them is a great inventor or artist or something else that brings value to the city in the future. As the population grows and the generations pass, people put down roots. There are thousands of people in Washington, DC who have no direct involvement with the federal government and that's because of organic economic growth. "

"So the way that was explained to me (I'm not from the US and Germany does not have such a system at all, so I could be wrong) is that all things equal, someone from a less privileged background has to work so much harder to get the same score.

So the logic there is: You're from some troubled family, inner city, you have to work through high school to support your parents and siblings, you don't get enough sleep because there's always shit going down in the neighborhood. You manage to get 800. Good fucking job!

Now this other guy, rich parents, gets private tutoring all the time. Has not a care in the world and could devote all his time to studying. They get 800. Well... duh, should have tried harder and got 900. 

So that's their logic. I see some merit to that thought, but ultimately also lots of problems: Why make it about race and not class? Clearly the Obama kids are more privileged than the kids of some West Virginian coal miner. And why not address the inequalities and different conditions much earlier than at the college admission stage?

I guess that's my European background coming through. If you think that this is just tough luck and kids should deal with what they're dealt with: Wouldn't consider a generally well-educated populace a pretty solid ""infrastructure"" investment?"

"Have you ever heard the term ""Mountain Dew Baby?"" I spent a fair amount of time photographing the poorest and most rural parts of Appalachia and I was stunned to see women putting Mountain Dew in baby bottles and giving it to their infants. The water in the area was not terribly clean and buying Mountain Dew was less expensive than bottled water, milk, or juice. These women all had terrible teeth and you can imagine what their children looked like. 

I went home and researched this to see if anyone else was talking about it. I found an older article from Salon that really pissed me off. The article came across as patronizing to me. I'd just spent three months with these people. I knew they weren't as stupid and backwards as everyone assumed they were. This woman's explanation for why women were giving their babies mountain dew was, ""Nobody ever told them not to. That’s one reason why their babies get cavities so fast.” No. That's not why. These women knew they shouldn't be giving their babies soda, but they were so poor and so desperate that they didn't know what else to do. Many of the women were terrified to breast feed because they knew what was in their own system that they didn't want to pass on to a baby. The state of rural white America is one of the saddest things I've ever seen because it is almost entirely ignored. These people don't matter to the politicians because they aren't a visible problem.

"Washing your face is important.  Don't buy a crazy exfoliating/scrubber/heavy duty one.  A gentle cleanser will do the trick and not harm your skin.  Always moisturize afterwards, again using a gentle moisturizer.  SPF is an added bonus if you want to have a little anti-aging going for you.

If you want to do a little bit of exfoliating once or twice a week, fold a washcloth into a square and put some face cleanser on top.  Wet your face and make gentle circular motions (without pressing down, that can create dermabrasions which are not beneficial).  Spend about 30 seconds on each side of your face, and another 30 in the forehead region.  

Invest in a decent razor/blades.  Always wash your face prior to shaving.  

Figure out the haircut you like or what one works for you.  Know how to describe it in pretty good detail to your barber.  Find a BARBER.  Don't use a salon.  Barbers will be way, way cheaper, and you'll receive a better haircut.

If you're going out and its casual attire, and you don't feel like wearing a polo or don't like the way you look in a polo, consider a henley (the shirts with three buttons).  They're considered more formal than a t-shirt, and almost always look good on anyone. 

Wear clothes that fit.  Consider slim fitting pants.  Try things on in the dressing room.  Find a clothing line that fits your body best, not all clothing companies make their clothes the same.  Use the basics with color coordination (no black with brown).

"You're not really disagreeing, I don't think, just approaching the same thing from two different perspectives, and the choice of words ""put the other person before yourself"" was unfortunate.

It's what they call ""give and take"" - it implies a balance - and it's certainly one of the toughest challenges in even the healthiest relationship, and your experience is completely understandable in that context.

The point is that when my wife says ""I wish you would do x instead of y"" the conversation that follows isn't about either of us being the other's supplicant. It's about her explaining why she wishes that to be the case, my acceptance of her argument or explanation of why I disagree with her, and the two of us deciding together how it's best to move forward in consideration of our different perspectives. Neither is kowtowing to a demand of the other, but certainly we have to be receptive to the idea that our opinions on a topic may differ, and it can be worthwhile to learn from each other to reach a better consensus."

"Stayed in my college town over the summer to work and get high with my friends. Our dealer is pretty cool but had some really terrible ideas which we never agreed to, until one day he mentions that there are a bunch of bikes at the residence halls that kids left when they went home, just waiting to be ""claimed"". For some reason, my friend and I agreed to this one. So later that night, along with one of the dealer's buddies, all of us high as kites, we head over to one of the residence halls. Somehow, I am persuaded to drive, and because I am an idiot, I bring along my weed and stash it in my center console. So we head in and the dealer finds one that he likes and hightails it out of there on the bike, leaving my buddy and I with the dealer's friend, whom we'll call Dave. 

One thing we had not considered was that all the residence halls had hall directors that stayed over the summer. So while we waited for the dealer to return (none of us gave a fuck about biking, we were just along for the ride, no pun intended), cops roll up and the residence director pops out of the building and starts telling the cops that we hadn't touched anything but he watched our ""leader"" (as if we were a gang or something) run off with a bike. So the three of us get questioned by the boys in blue as to where our accomplice has run off to. My buddy and I sure as fuck don't know, and the dealer's buddy ain't telling. So we're asked to give our names and ID info, which goes fine, though we're scared shitless because we're still high as hell and I have weed in the car parked like 200 feet away. Until the dealer's buddy tried to give a fake frickin' name, which the cop does NOT like, so he drags that kid into the cop car. He comes back to me and my buddy, gives us a onceover, then tells us ""Get the fuck out of here, you retards."" We agree quickly, head to the car and quickly drive 5 MPH under the speed limit out of there. Lesson learned: never commit (other) crimes while baked."

"I *always* wondered this. She just vanished. She was a towny, not in school, so there was nothing. Still bugs me. "
"Okay. Use a reasonable quality soap. Worth using a wash cloth or loofah or mitt to help scrub dead skin and old sweat away. WASH THIS THING REGULARLY! Like once or twice a week. It gets wet and gets all the gross stuff all over it. Wash it. 

Next, change your towel two to three times a week. It will seem like it could go longer but, like the wash cloth, it's picking up old skin, moisture, and bacteria that start to breed. You just rub that all back onto you. 

Use reasonable quality deodorant. Cheap stuff may be cheaper per bottle but either it'll smell gross or you'll need to use more, or both. 

Wash shirts after every use in summer, at most after two wears in winter, and if you've got a bit sweaty then dried and thought it's be okay to go another wear: it's not. Wash it. 

Also, change your bed sheets at least once every two weeks. Again, same as the towel, you're sweating and shedding skin all over your sheets. Once or twice a year pop your mattress and pillows out in the sun to air out. This freshens them up too. 

I find that once tee shirts and tops start getting a bit old they begin to make me smell more quickly. To postpone this I spray the underarms with a stain remover before washing them, from when the top is brand new. 

I used to have huge problems with body odour. I've finally got it under control. I am quick to sweat when I'm nervous and I didn't wash my loofah or bedsheets as often as I should've.

(Probably worth noting, I'm a woman, I'm not at all overweight, and I have a healthy diet.)"

"And this is why I think the government should offer free sterilization. ""Are you a junkie? Don't want to worry about pesky, free-loading, ungrateful children? Well, worry no more! Uncle Sam has got you covered!"" 

Edit: I'm not suggesting anyone is forced into anything. I'm suggesting that offering long-term, free birth control solutions would probably be a huge help in this situation. Personally, I think offering it would be helpful in a wide variety of situations. People shouldn't be left without access to reliable, long-term birth control due to finances or any other reason. Making birth control accessible across the board only reduces the amount of times a child is brought into the world under the care of people who are not ready to care for that child. Having a child should be as much of an active choice as possible, regardless of whether that person is a junkie, college student, suburban mom, etc."

"To those people, here's my advice:

Don't worry about getting honked at.  If it is obvious that you are passing a slower driver, *most* drivers will have enough patience to let you safely pass so long as you weren't a dick who moved over when they were already too close for it.  If they are going to honk at you, they are just being asshats.

Personally, I have a set speed in mind while driving and do everything I can to maintain it without putting other drivers in danger.  I do go a little faster (maybe 2 to 3 mph faster) when passing as a semi-courtesy to faster drivers in the passing lane, but always return to my target speed before moving back over to make sure I'm still going faster than the other person.  Worst case I've gotten was someone trying to pass me on the right as I'm moving back over, but that was one interaction out of innumerable instances of other drivers seeming to understand what I was doing and having the patience for me to complete the pass.  I've seen this prove true both here is southern California, and in rural New Mexico.  When driving in Texas, though, the ""left lane for passing only"" law on highways made things a lot easier when visiting Lubbock."

"My school does this in 11th grade - I believe our state requires it, but I'm not completely sure. From what I've heard, the curriculum is decent (how to budget, how to do taxes, etc.,), but the main problem teachers tend to have is getting the kids focused. Half the kids there don't care about the information and will just cheat on what they have to do. We also have mandatory career training (depending on the type of diploma), but it also faces the same problems as the personal finance class. 

The idea sounds great, in theory, but it's not all peaches and cream in reality. Teenagers are just really stupid. "
"It's funny how this little scene stuck in my head all these years. I was in a mall and an older father, probably in his 40s or 50s, was with his little 4-year-old-ish son. The little boy started crying about something, sounded like a disappointed or hurt feelings cry, not a whiney I-want-it-now cry, although I think this dad would have reacted equally well to the 2nd kind of cry too.

Anyway, the dad kneels down to look straight in his boy's eyes, talks to him briefly, with empathy, about what the boy is sad about, and then said some consoling words and hugged him as the boy wiped away tears, trying to pull his little 4-year-old self together. 

My heart just melted and I immediately looked at the man's left hand to see if he was married. Of course he was.

It is just SO UNUSUAL to see a man treat a son that way, in public. I've seen dads joke around with their kids in public, seen them reprimand their sons or daughters and tell them to ""man up"" and stop crying, whining, or fidgeting in public. I've seen plenty of dads kinda ignore their kids in public. But to kneel down like that, to get at eye level, and react to 4-year-old concerns with empathy and take them seriously - OMG, that is so rare.

Even though they were in public, I could tell from the way the dad focused on his little boy, that nothing was more important to that man in that moment than his little boy. It was such a beautiful, empathetic sight. 

It was also significant to me because in all my life, I've never seen my ex, the father of my kids, react that way to any of our children when they were young - or even when they were older. "

And then at 3am, would head back down to 7 for a joint and happen upon Jason spun outta his mind, begging me to come back to his and play FIFA til dawn. We would usually be surrounded by burly British bankers in half-buttoned shirts, haranguing the African street dealers for coke. Beautiful. "

"&gt; She told me (and I believed!?) that she couldn't get pregnant.

In my experience (having been told I couldn't get pregnant without much medical reason) doctors can be kind of cavalier about this 'diagnosis'. The real truth is that, barring very evident problems (missing uterus, missing testicles), if you haven't been through years of trying to have a baby and very expensive testing, you really have *no* idea whether or not you can get pregnant and neither does any doctor you see.

I've even heard of girls with a diagnosis of endometriosis (not even confirmed by laparoscopy) being told they can never have kids-- it's myth! They might have higher odds of infertility, but that's NOT the same as 'you can never have a baby'. I have no idea why such misinformation is so prevalent or so tolerated in the medical community.

"I don't know.

Married for 10 years. Found out this week that she cheated on me last year.
Still talks to him, says she loves him and wants to be with him.
Some fucker she met on LOTRO.

I'm ready to file for divorce on Monday.
But 10 years is a long time. We were together for 6 years before we got married.

We changed as people.
A few years ago I got a great job, more money, more self confidence, I just felt I had grown as a person.
She stagnated. Worked the same job for 10 years. No vacation time, no challenge.
Spent all her off time either on the couch reading, watching the same crap over and over on Netflix, or on her phone (probably chatting with him, I found their chat history when working on her computer).

It worried me. I thought she was depressed. I tried to help. Get her to go out more, be among friends, experience new things. I offered to help with her job. Tried to get her to talk to her boss, even offered to talk to him myself. Tried to get her interested in taking classes to further her career (print media is dead).
All I would ever get was 'meh'.

So I worked on myself. Tried to make me better.
I did everything with her and us in mind though.

She told me that she loved him last night.
It crushed me. Crushed me at the very core.
I'm still in a daze.

I'm okay with moving on. I just want it over with fast.
But 16 years together. Mostly all good years. Beautiful years that I wouldn't change for the world. That history has weight.

So no, right now no.
If enough time passes, she takes ownership for hurting me and grows as a person.
Maybe.

But it just hurts too goddamn much right now."

"tl;dr: It made me diabetic which led to serious heart problems.

I've had a lifetime struggle with losing weight and I saw Freelee the Banana girl, an extremely popular Vegan on YT. She has a great body and she eats fruit fruit fruit all day and carbs (potatoes, rice, pasta) at night.
What she DOESN'T talk much about is how much daily strenuous exercise she does to burn all that sugar she's eating. She just tells people how lazy she is and your body needs you to flood it with fruit, so I thought I can eat endless fruit and I'll be fit like her without having to do much exercise.

I started following her eating habits: Banana &amp; Date smoothies for breakfast, half a water melon for lunch, baked potato slices with romaine lettuce and chili sauce for dinner. Snacking on fruit all day.

When I got my blood work done my average blood sugar shot up to 157 and I became a diabetic.
Went on 1000 mg of Metformin a day. 
Diabetes leads to tremendous Health problems and heart disease.

I now eat 0 fruit, and almost only chicken and vegetables. This has helped me to lose 40 pounds in 9 months. Overloading on fruit didnt give me weight loss but overloading on veggies did.
This new diet has my AIC down to pre diabetic levels so I got off the medicine, but a lot of damage was done to my body from all the fruit.

So being ""Fruitarian"" nearly destroyed my health. I'm now on three medications for my heart. Prior to ""veganism"" I wasn't on any medication.
I'm happy to not eat meat if someone can come up with a good serious diet, but eating endless carbs is terrible for non-athletes."

"Thank you for saying this. 

I am currently a 5th grade science teacher, I'd like to give an educators perspective. I teach several students who aspire to be in STEM and I can candidly say that many of my kiddos have no idea what they're talking about. Several of them want to go into STEM solely based on the fact that they did well on it in grade school and that it is a ""money making"" field, and these ideas are often perpetuated by parents and grandparents who are better off financially.

You enjoyed science in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade? Awesome! It's great that you loved all of the hands-on activities that literally explained the bare basics in simple, rudimentary language. Once you get to my classroom, the high school level, and college level, it's an entirely different ball game. This mentality unfortunately doesn't get any different at the high school level or college level, either: students who routinely receive D's in critical subjects such as science and mathematics strive to be in the STEM fields with absolutely no knowledge of what it means to be in STEM, the work that it takes...even as a fifth grade science teacher I had to take several advanced collegiate courses in chemistry, biology, and geology. Also, even with a STEM degree there is no guarantee that you will be making a ton of money. 

I am by no means trying to discredit the dreams of my students, but most of them have no idea what they are talking about. They fail their freshman year but want to be engineers. They take no advanced classes when they are given the opportunity but expect to be given an internship at Google. It's pure insanity."

"I remember the first time I ever heard about this. I lived in Des Moines, IA and went to Central Campus part time (basically a tech school for high schoolers) and me and a couple buddies were exploring the basement area of the old building and I ended up finding some writing on a piece of pipe saying something along the lines of “Wheres Johnny Gosch?” Being a young kid in a creepy old basement and seeing that really stuck with me. So later on that night I had brought up my little misadventure of the basement to my mother an told her about the creepy writing. She then informed me that Johnny had gone missing in the 80’s and that she’d actually known the Gosch family before his disappearance. I will say that this is the first time I’ve heard about the pedophile ring, his mothers claims that he’s visited her, or any of these other absolutely wild stories surrounding him. I will most definitely investigate further when its not the middle of the night. "

"Three years ago a homeless junkie kicked the side door in on my detached garage and stole two *broken* power tools off the floor. The police officer who filled out my report recognized the company I worked at and asked if I knew so-and-so, who was one of his best friends since grade school.   Know him? I collaborate with the guy on a project literally every week. Officer then pulls his fingerprint kit out of his trunk, dusts my door frame down, pulls some prints and says he will run them when he gets back to the station.  
  
 Three years later - A little over a month ago, my house was robbed while I was out of town and was completely trashed. Everything inside worth more than $50 was stolen or destroyed. The officers who arrived just walked through and left without any paperwork. The next day two different officers came to take a statement to generate a burglary report. On neither occasion did anyone take prints or  talk to neighbors to see if anyone saw anything. Zero effort. The icing was my having to go back to the station several times to hassle them into getting the report finished. When they finally printed it they charged me for the copies and only gave me page 1 of 5. I had to drive back to get the rest.  The property crimes detective assigned to my case never once returned a phone message or request for a brief meeting.  Over $5k of electronics and numerous firearms were stolen.   
  
The moral of this story is this:  in most cases, ""police"" are a myth that keep only the honest or the dumb from committing crimes. They are in most cases simply bureaucrats who arrive after the fact to document a crime. You will be much safer the moment you realize that your choices and actions make you much more or less safe than any ""police"" ever will. This includes avoiding dangerous places or risky behavior and being able to handle yourself should you need to.

"Oh God this reminds me of a recently solved disappearance that happened not too long ago.  I'm a bit fuzzy on the complete details but Peter ""Peter-boy"" Kema's case is considered ""solved."" It was a horrible case of child abuse by the parents and his case slipped through the cracks at CPS.  His parents maintained for years that they had ""given him"" to an ""Aunty Rose"" for her to take care of to explain his disappearance and the police only had circumstancial evidence and not enough to prosecute for his murder for years.

It wasn't until his sister recalled seeing him in a box in a closet shortly before his disappearance, years later and his mother agreeing to testify against her husband that the public was able to find out what happened.  Supposedly, as part of the father's plea agreement, if they are unable to find Peter's remains where he said he buried them, he'd be subject to a polygraph.  AFAIK, we still haven't heard if the remains have been found or not.

Funny thing though is that the existence of ""Aunty Rose,"" a person that everyone thought didn't exist, actually did!  They found her years later, as she apparently moved to the continetal US shortly before everything happened."

"It's Christmas Day and my sister and I are waiting in the departures lounge of the Durban International airport (South Africa).

She heads to the bathroom to complete her pre-flight ritual (anti-airsickness meds and a quick prayer to any deity that'll listen) and comes back looking visibly weirded out.

I asked her if she's alright and she blurts out ""I made the cleaning lady cry""

Turns out when she entered the bathroom the cleaning lady was busy doing her thing. She sees my sister enter and because my sister wears a scarf (we're Muslim) she motions her to use the toilet at the furthest end since it has a bidet hose (and us Islamists are all about dem bidet hoses). She also does this with the biggest smile.

So my sis uses the bathroom and, feeling touched that the lady helped her out, decided to give her the last 100rand she had in her wallet. After all, we were leaving the country and wouldn't be back to South Africa for awhile. Also 100 rand is about the equivalent of about ten Aussie dollars, so when you think about it not a huge monetary amount in the scheme of things.

So my sis hands the lady the money and starts to say something appropriately Christmassy. Before she can though, the woman's face starts to crumple and she drops her mop. She starts sobbing. Not like crying gently or anything, but clutching the money to her chest and sobbing. 

My sister, socially awkward butterfly that she is, panics, pats the woman a few times on the shoulder and evacuates the bathroom as quickly as she can.

I got this story out of her over the following ten hour flight. 

And that is how my visibly Muslim sister somehow took part in a Christmas miracle."

A few months later, I went to a different bathroom, and there were more meatballs. They're inescapable."

"Haha fair enough. Although I'll be honest, I made it seem more crazy than it actually was. 

So I work in security that works directly with the government, so if anything happens at our building won't don't call city police, we call military police. 

So we were just finishing an overnight shift, it's about 6:30am or so; people were coming into the building, our supervisors had come in to do a shift handover and we were just chatting when someone from the humdinger came to the front desk. They said ""it's probably nothing, but there's a suspicious looking bag outside near the trash can."" Whether it was real or not, we heard ""suspicious bag"" and immediately went into serious mode. I called the military police, supervisor got on the cameras, and her partner started calling our direct bosses. All of us were doing something equally important in this situation. That is all of us besides my partner, who I will refer to as Clueless. Because we were all so busy, none of us stopped to see what he might be doing during all this. 

So I'm on the phone with the MPs, who now have access to our CCTV which is trained directly on this bag sitting next to the garbage can and smoke pit, it looked like a shopping bag, which is partially open and what looks like cloth billowing out of it in the wind. I'm describing to him what it looked like, when we got notified of it, who notified us, etc and he's doing MP stuff on his end. All very serious, and everyone treating it as such. But then we see it, and my heart sinks. 

Slowly into frame, we see Clueless walk carelessly right up to the bag, stop, lean over it and look in, and KICKS THE BAG. And then kicks it again, assuming he's trying to get a better look inside. 

Time stopped. The whole lobby was dead silent as all three of us are collectively saying ""what the actual fuck"" silently to ourselves. The silence is broken by the MP saying ""did he just..."" to which I have nothing better than ""...yeah..."" I forget how the rest of the phone call went with the MP as I am now losing my mind and just want to get off the phone as quickly as possible. 

Thankfully nothing blew up, and now satisfied with his excellent EOD skills, he saunters back into the building with the biggest smile and the ego of someone who just saved the day. ""Oh, it's nothing is just a bag"" he says, so proud of himself. My supervisor, as professional
And calm as a middle aged Quebec French woman could, layed into him. At no point did she yell or scream or swear at him, but you just knew by the way she spoke that she was trying SO hard not to strangle him where he stood. Before I left for the day, I had to write an incident report explaining what took place, and that got sent off to our higher ups, and I'm sure he got a serious talking to and maybe a write up, but behind that he still works for the company. 

I've got hundreds of stories of things this guy said or did, even to the point where I briefly had a twitter account that was solely just the insane and confusing things he would say on a daily basis. 

He wasn't a bad dude though. He just didn't know better, and sadly made no effort to try to know better; which is unfortunate as I e met his brother and dad, and they were easily head and shoulders above him in common sense. He was a baffling person to know, but I'm glad that I did, because now I have so many great stories to tell.

I am massively frustrated by the short sighted way some of my friends handle money.

"This really depends what you consider to be a nation. Poland, as a nation, has a continuous history and unique culture, language, tradition and customs that stretch back all the way to 966 (and before that, even). If you wanna say it was founded in 1918...sure, go ahead, but I disagree. The II RP, founded in 1918, was the official successor state (universal fact) to the I RP. The main difference is that the US was _declared_, and before 1776 you had little to no cultural, linguistic and historical glue to even create a nation. The _government_ of the US might be one of the older ones, but as a nation the US is but a child. The history of the US starts in 1776 - if you _really_ want to stretch, you can probably go back a hundred more years at best. China probably holds the record when it comes to being the oldest country with the oldest continuous history. "

"They also sold the PS3 with the ability to install another OS as a supported, advertised feature. Then they removed that feature with a software update that you had to install to use any online feature of the system.

*That* was the feature that tipped me over the edge to buy a PS3 instead of an Xbox360 back in the day. I figured that once I'd gotten the next system it'd be a fun little project to install Linux on it, maybe turn it into a server or media center or something. Without that feature the two systems were pretty much tied in terms of how much I wanted each.

I will not ever buy any Sony products again. I don't know if they've got features on it that will break my stuff, or if they'll take away whatever feature was the deciding factor in my buying their product in the first place."

"One of my college acquaintances had this ornate box that looked like something you might see in a fantasy movie. Most of its body was decorated by a swirling, cloud-like pattern of green and red, and it had a thick, golden frame that flowed down into four rounded-off feet. Despite being kept on a shelf amidst a collection of books, this little chest was disconcertingly eye-catching... although part of that effect *may* have come from the sticky-note that was affixed to its front latch, which read ""DO NOT OPEN!""

It was enough to pique one's interest, to say the least.

Now, the young woman who owned the box was a talkative, outgoing individual, well-known for cracking jokes and offering witty observations about almost everything. Whenever the topic of what was in the container came up, though, she'd grow darkly silent, change the subject, and refuse to even acknowledge its presence in the room. This spawned a number of theories - some of which were more reasonable than others - about what she could be hiding, where it might have come from, and why she kept the damned thing in her apartment if it caused her so much distress. (One of the more outrageous ideas was that it held a dead family member's preserved finger, given that it was too small to contain an entire body's worth of ashes.)

One evening, another friend of mine suggested that we wait until our hostess was out of the room, then take a quick peek into the forbidden box.

I'm not one who shies away from a challenge, and I've never been reluctant to ask questions or explore, but I wasn't entirely comfortable with the idea of violating someone's privacy. Even so, it didn't take long before my curiosity got the better of me, and I agreed to go along with the plan. My friend and I waited until the box's owner had departed for her kitchen, and then - with my cohort keeping watch - I rushed over and gingerly lifted its lid.

The fact that I yelped out loud should tell you how shocked I was.

I mean that literally, by the way: The box gave me an electrical shock as I opened it... and the only thing inside was a second sticky-note, which read ""I WARNED YOU!""

When the young woman came back to the living room, the smug smile on her face made it clear that she knew *exactly* what had happened. Given that my other friend hadn't looked inside the box, though, I did my best to pretend that I'd seen something truly terrifying, and I refused to say anything further. He, of course, had a look (and a shock) of his own a little later on in the night, after which we were told that the prank's inner workings were hidden beneath a false bottom, and activated after the lid had been lifted far enough.

I would have liked to see how it all worked... but that would have required opening the box again.

**TL;DR: I peeked inside a girl's box, and I was shocked by what I** ***didn't*** **see.**"

"Probably because you are young.

Suppose you become a plumber. it's been 30 years of crawling around on floors and under houses and cramming yourself in weird positions. Your knees are shot and your back aches all the time. It's been 30 winters of slogging through ice-cold water from busted pipes and 30 summers of sweating your balls off while digging up the sewage main through a nest of tree roots. 

You're tired. You just want to slow down. But you can't. You've got 15 more years to retirement. So you carry on, and hope that you aren't replaced by someone a bit younger, faster and cheaper. Your 30 years of experience should count for something - but homeowners tend to bargain hunt...

Meanwhile, the accountant is having similar problems. His age is starting to affect his work, due to health reasons. But he just runs out to the eye doctor, gets a pair of glasses and carries on for the next 15 years until retirement. No problem. He doesn't need his knees or his back to make a living - and, even if he did, they are in excellent condition, because he hasn't sacrificed the well-being of his body in exchange for a livable wage. 

This isn't a new problem. Look around a work site. How many folks over 50 do you see?"

"Understand that this may not fly with all guys, though. I'm a pretty private person as far as my relationships go, and so I'm not comfortable with my grlfriend talking about our sex life to their friends.

I once heard about a conversation that she was a part of in which she disclosed something about one of the silly things we do in bed, and it was embarrassing for me to hear about it from someone I didn't know very well. I talked to my girlfriend about it, let her know how I felt, and as far as I know, she hasn't said anything about her sex life to her friends since. She's usually pretty good about that sort of thing, which is wonderful.

It's not wrong to talk about sex lives and that shit, but do try to keep your partner in mind when you do. Most guys don't care, but some do. Getting permission is always the best route, but if you know your partner well you should be able to gauge their level of okayness without having to outright ask them."

"A photograph that I myself had taken.

My mom died a year ago of a very aggressive form of leukemia.   She was diagnosed on a Tuesday and died 11 days later.   

During those 11 days we opted for in-home hospice.   While she was still lucid and awake, she met with her grandchildren and presented each of them with a baby quilt that she had painstakingly hand-made for *their* children (her great-grandchildren), if and when they have any.   

""I wanted to present these to you when you actually have your children"" she said ""but that's not going to happen so I'm giving these to you now.""

I, in the background, quietly observing (and trying not to fall apart), snapped a photo of the scene - my mom in her robe with her grandchildren (all in their early/mid 20's) sitting around her, each with a beautiful quilt over their laps - and sent it to a friend of mine to kind of share in the pain and grief.   

Six months later, for Christmas, my friend had printed that photo out and put it in a simple frame, wrapped it, and gave it to me as a present.

I hadn't given the photo much thought and had almost forgotten about it.  So unwrapping it and seeing Mom there again hit me like a freight train.   "

"I didn't consider, I assumed :)"
"The hardest part of adjusting to adulthood, for me, was realizing that meeting new people and developing new friendships wouldn't be ""automatic"" anymore. As you age, you don't have those situations where you're forced to be around people that cause friendships to blossom, and so, it's very easy to get stuck in a rut of being around the same people. That's why most people's social circles tend to narrow as they become older.

I've made two major moves in my life, both to places where I knew very few people, and I've found that the best way to meet people is to jump into hobbies. For example, right now, I joined an improv comedy class, which is where most of my social life is coming from. I'm also part of a longboarding group, where we meet up once every 2-3 weeks and chill out and skate together. Through these, I've found most of my friends in the area. 

The common advice is to use meetup.com, and that's a pretty solid resource, but you should be selective in the meetups you attend. Avoid the general ""New To LA"" or ""Single Mixers"" groups - those are usually pretty awkward and don't work for me at all. Instead, choose groups that are focused on an activity or a topic, like bowling or reading or craft beer. The groups formed in those tend to be more tight knit, and it's easy to get into. 

My last piece of advice would be to chill out and don't put too much pressure on yourself to constantly be social. Go out when you want to, and stay in when you want to as well. Do whatever you think would make you happy. I have mild anxiety that rises and ebbs, so sometimes I just can't muster the strength to go to events and things. It took a while for me to realize that that's fine - that my happiness comes first, and I should work to maintain that over trying to maintain some external expectation of always having plans."

"In an effort to get the upper hand in prolonged trench battles, the British would make pseudo trees that a soldier could hide inside. They would photograph a tree that was on the battlefield, then study it and recreate it in a workshop. The real tree would be cut down and replaced overnight so the enemy wouldn't know what happened. There was even a little ladder inside for the soldier to climb up and survey the enemy.

"Neck hair needs to go. You don't need a barber, you can do it yourself with a razor. Pluck the crazy hairs coming out of your eyebrows, ears, and nose. Also out of any moles you may have. Clip your fingernails. Wear clean clothes that fit. Ditch the white tennis shoes. Don't talk with your mouth full. If your skin is looking dull, you can wet your face thoroughly, and scrub some regular granulated sugar on your skin. It will exfoliate the top layer of skin, removing the dead skin cells making you look dull. Then buy a decent moisturizer with spf in it and lightly moisturize. If your skin is too shiny,  buy some oil-eliminating astringent (neutrogena clear pore) and use after washing your face at night. Then lightly moisturize. Your skin should start to dry out and be less shiny, but still moisturized. "

"Oh I am, I stay away from those type of people. And my drug use was always a choice never an addiction. Which takes a lot of smarts and willpower when talking about things like meth, coke, heroin. 

Heroin being the last one I tried and it's not for me. Ive never liked opiates. 

With that being said I thought about heroin for a week after using it one time, these were like intursive thoughts the way they came about, even though it's feeling is almost identical to oxy ive never had oxy do that to me. I can understand someone getting hooked if their will isn't strong.

Also; it's important to realize that not all drug users are criminals, they can be resposible, normal people and use drugs without having issues, committing crimes or being violent. It's also good to note that addiction shouldn't be a crime and we should charge drug users who use for personal use. 

We should really have programs in place that give them the option to get help for free and not lock them up.

Curiosity drove my experimentation, and a bit of necessity as I lost insurance but was on necessary meds, one of which could have killed me with withdrawl, but money was more of a concern for my healthcare provider than me being alive.

It was an interesting time in my life, that is just winding down. Ive experience a lot of different drugs from many different classes including rc and am still healthy and alive, free from prosectution for doing something that could harm no one but myself by choice. 

Now all I want is my medications that make me not suffer and help me function. I count my blessings I never fell into addiction, or jail like many around me did.

"This is really horrible. Transitioning is supposed to be a happy thing. Maybe the people who act like that have never had welcoming support from the people close to them? Or never opened themselves up to that welcoming support and just assumes it's all negative?

I know two people who have transitioned and it's almost crazy good to see how they are now compared to how they were before.

Before, they both had a series of depression issues. You could tell they were struggling with something for almost all of their lives. Suicide attempts or calls for help. They just weren't happy and I don't think anyone, even them, knew what was wrong.

Now that they've both transitioned, it's like the weight of the world has been lifted off their shoulders and you can see it in their eyes how happy they are now.

Seeing them now is just kinda like ""oh! It all makes sense now!""

One of them is a relative of sorts, he had always struggled with life when he was a she. Now he's so close to becoming a doctor! Everyone in my family is super proud of him!

It makes me very happy to know that they never fell into communities with these types of attitudes. 

They've figured out the issue that was bugging them all along and now it's time for them to be happy and enjoy life. They deserve it.

So do you too! So, I'm glad you never got into that mentality either!"
"God, it's so bad sometimes. Recently they've decided to go after Adam Ellis. That BuzzFeed guy who does comic strips. It started when someone layered his character model and realized it was identical (even though there's a ton of posts about how terrible Steven Universe is because they go off model all the time). Cue all the harassment and mocking of the guy who's probably just trying to make money of his graphic design degree by taking a job. I know I'd take it. 

Eventually, the guy lashes out, saying something along the lines of ""Go back to taking deviant art commissions and leave me alone"". And sets his Twitter account to private. And now a ton of people are sending him death threats and wishing him dead.  

I wasn't even surprised by this. "

"My ex wasn't always abusive. When he started doing things that made me uneasy, I didn't go to family for advice because I'd always heard not to badmouth my partner.

Things escalated, very slowly. After 13 years, his behavior finally started to scare me. He didn't hit me, and he didn't yell, but he controlled every facet of my life. I had no friends left. The sexual abuse I thought was normal male behavior continued to escalate. As far as anyone knew, I'd never had a single complaint about him.


When I tried to go to my family for help, they asked me if I was lying now, or I'd been lying to them for 13 years. He was able to convince them I was going crazy. 

When he took me to the psych ward, they said I didn't need involuntary commitment, but none of the people who thought I was a paranoid liar would give me a safe place to go. I signed myself in rather than go home with him, and spent a week in the hospital working through some stuff and figuring out what to do next.

I wholeheartedly regret confiding in no one when I was worried about my relationship."

"&gt;My experience with Chinese and Japanese companies was mostly that criticism wasn't very welcome

I'm not sure if the criticism itself is not welcome, it's more that admitting fault is a massive issue. Once you get over the initial ""Everything is great! Nothing can ever go wrong!"" statement (even though we all know everything is not great), they are extremely receptive to change, so long as it prevents any more uncomfortable conversations about how they fucked up (although they still will never actually accept the blame).

Note, this about my experience with Chinese offices, not Japanese. I'm not sure I would ever lump those two cultures together."

"Summer camp counsellor here. Names have been changed to protect the innocent.

Samantha found it hilarious to scream ""ROASTED!"" at inoppertune times, such as upon learning someone's pet bunny died or when a kindergartener fell on her face and knocked a tooth out.

Taylor wrote fanfiction. Weird, weird fanfiction. In one of them, Guy Montag from Fahrenheit 451 was fucking Elizabeth from Bioshock. A Big Daddy was involved. She would read these loudly and publically. 

Samuel enjoyed telling people how much he ""balls"" and ""sexes."" According to him, he has ""sexed"" with 200 girls, and all of them have ""humongous boobies."" He claims he has ""sexed"" Kiera Knightly, Taylor Swift and Emma Watson. This list grows longer daily.

Lily says ""dat face doe"" a lot, and at completely random moments. It's unclear whether this is intended as a compliment or an insult. She also really likes Beyoncé to the point of obsession. 

Tim has a fidgit spinner collection. He doesn't ever actually use them, just proudly shows them off. He claims one of them cost $22.50. This is treated like it is $1,000.

Amanda likes to attempt to twerk. She also tells everyone about how she wishes she could get pregnant because she's ready to be a mom. Amanda is 13. She also has no idea how sex works, seeing as she seems to think pregnancy spontaneously happens when a woman is ready. 

Kyle insists he's part pony and will neigh loudly. He is a major brony and refers to the kindergarten girls who enjoy the show as his ""pegasisters."" He likes to discuss the show with these 4 year olds, and gets mad when they don't know it like the back of their hand.

This phrase is the worst absolute garbage. I also hate when people are like you need to become ""someone"" when you get a good career. I am already someone. I don't need to be special or have an amazing job to be someone. Everyone is someone. People need to seriously top with this. People treat me differently when they know I am a college student than when I spent my gap year as a waitress. It's infuriating. I am already someone.

"People saying Tupac would be a detective on a TV show are wrong. He was doing movies before he died.

He'd definitely get into politics. He already sort of was before getting murdered. Both of his parents were black panthers and he was a smart guy so he'd work that. "

Not middle school but freshman year of high school we had a sub in English and we dared the one kid to snort chalk like it was cocaine. He walked up grabbed the chalk the sub was very confused but just let it go. He proceeded to break part of it off and using his school ID break it up and cut it into lines and used a dollar bill to snort it. The sun watched all this happen looked at me and was like should I report this and i just said no and she was like okay and just sat back down. My high school was wild watched a kid get stabbed through the hand with a pencil for looking at somebody wrong. It was some great times.

"Ugh, God. A girl I knew in elementary used to be my best friend and had me over at her house one day. Her little brother (maybe six or so) came into the room with her *older* brother's (like 17?) gun. This was in Canada, so a 17 year old having a gun is *extra fucking goddamn bad news*, but both her and the little brother thought it was okay.

The little brother was playing with it by pretending to point it at her and saying, ""Bang!"" That was creepy enough, but then he pointed at *me* and my friend got after me to say, ""Wow, you're really overreacting, it's not even loaded,"" when I noped out to go sit by the front door and wait for my mom.

Seriously. That shit was not cool, and I'm still not sure if I'm more angry or concerned about her that either of them thought anything in that situation was alright."

Any one of those points is something that can start a conversation, but if I just say ""I saw a fox"", it's very limiting.  I have to force myself to go into more detail, especially if I'm just chatting with a person I've just met or have little in common with."

"""Jesus H. Christ"" is a blasphemous expletive used by Irish Catholics when they're drunk and angry. I had heard it used as a child, and so thought it was just the Irish Catholic way to growl Christ's ""full name"" when drunk and angry.

In fact, family (last) names did not enter regular usage until Napoleon forced them on his subjects in the late 18th/early 19th century. Thus ""Christ"" is not a name, but a title given to Jesus by His followers, because it means ""anointed one"" (signifying the Messiah) in Greek.

""H."" is completely made up, presumably by some now-forgotten drunk, angry Irish Catholic.

In His own times, Christ was simply known as ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and ""Jesus, son of Joseph (the carpenter)"", because that's how people were known back then."

"The correct answer is the microwave.

First, ""new"" implies there is already a stroller, which barring some deficiency which renders it nonfunctional, should be sufficient to last until next month.

Not having a microwave results in two problems:

1) Not being able to make food quickly, which decreases the likelihood the parent will make food at home, increasing the likelihood that the family will eat fast or junk food, which has a negative impact on the family's health. Even if the child is too young to be affected by this (ie: baby food only), having healthier parents is still a net gain for the child.

2) Not being able to easily reheat food, greatly decreasing the consumption of leftovers. This could either result in food being thrown away, or not being able to take advantage of buying/cooking in bulk. Both result in waste of funds which could otherwise have gone to the child.

An important tool for food preparation is much more beneficial than a cart to push your baby around the park."

"Oh God...watching one of my dogs get eaten. I live in Louisiana and I'm always terrified when one of them goes near water out in nature. I always have this fear that a gator is going to come out of the water and drag them away. Omg can you imagine what that would sound like? Holy shit I don't even like thinking about it. That is the last thing I want to see.

I also know people with small dogs who have had eagles just fly into thier yard and carry the dog away."
"Dido's ""Don't Leave Home"" is (or was, back when it was popular) sometimes interpreted as a fairly straightforward love song. It's intended to be about addiction.

"Gay guy here. I met my SO when I was 19 and a freshman in college. I was taking a Japanese course and met a nerdy girl who became a good friend. About a month goes by, and I finally admit to her that I'm gay (had only been out to family for two months by this point). Strangely enough, she reacts quite happily to this and says she knows someone I ABSOLUTELY must meet. Turns out that someone was her ex-boyfriend, who had also only come out (as bi) in the last two months as well. 

Next day, she and her ex are in my dorm.

We've been together for 8 years, and just got married in April."

"It was fairly common in the 40's and 50's to blame bad or scandalous activity on booze, whether or not there actually was any in the drink at all. That's what the line is really going for - the idea of the drink being drugged is (relatively) modern, as most roofie style date rape drugs didn't even come around until the 60's."

"These are people with families, interdependent systems where they currently live due to lack of resources. Many can't just pick up and go. And even for those who are unattached, they may not have anyone financially stable enough in their lives to cosign on an apartment. They may not have the money to lay down a deposit and all the associated fees in a new place. It's not easy to find a job everywhere, especially when you don't have the resources to have gotten a good education, gotten scholarships, gone to a good school, obtained a competitive degree. Often times the jobs you can get will not let you live reasonably under the parameters described -  you end up working poor with no mobility, just in a different location with different constraints. If you have a family in this scenario, they can starve. Childcare is the highest cost associated with having children, is generally exorbitantly expensive even with the cheapest options in a city, when you've moved away from free childcare you might have had via your relatives. That'll be the majority of your income gone, easily. Literally all the steps leading up to everything listed are easier by several magnitudes if you are already lucky enough to have a decent foundation in life where your family and people hadn't been fucked over by the government for decades and decades. And that's if you and no one in your family is sick or disabled in any way.

What is easy for you is not easy for everyone."

The fine was $574.00, and I was not allowed to make payments.  There were no previous notes on my driving record except for a $25 no seat belt fine from the previous year.  I couldn't afford it within the 30 days from the ticket so they suspended my license, and the increase in my insurance + fine absolutely fucked me over hard.  It took me over a year to recover from that.  

I really didn't feel that punishment fit the crime.  I still don't."

"An employee told me a coworker was acting strange and I should check in on him. I track him down on the sales floor and try to start a conversation with him and he's visibly intoxicated. Weaving, slurred speech, flushed and sweaty. 

As he is vehemently denying he is under the influence he passes out. Literally just tips over backwards. Another manager and I drag him to the warehouse and then I call him a cab (protocol for employees under the influence is you verify, then call them a cab to a testing facility). 

He comes to and I explain to him what happened, he now needed to go take a drug test if he wanted any hope of saving his job, and that we would call him tomorrow to discuss next steps. About a half hour later I get a call from a semi panicked cab driver who is telling me he pulled up to the test facility and the guy jumped out of the car and ran. I tell him don't worry about it, he's free to go. 

The following morning this dude shows up to work like nothing happened. I look at him and he looks at me kind of waiting to see what's going to happen next. I say, ""Dude, you can't be here."" and before I can finish he just shrugs and leaves. Never saw or heard from him again. 

TLDR: guy passed out drunk at work and showed up the next day hoping nobody would remember. "

"It was a pattern that took months to put together, actually. My fiance and I noticed that every time she came over, articles of women's clothing would ~mysteriously~ turn up in our bedroom (which all guests had access to, as the only bathroom was attached to the bedroom). After many serious talks with my fiance, I started recognizing the clothing as hers, and eventually, I caught her slipping out of the bedroom during one of our parties, looking way too pleased with herself. I snuck in, rifled through the bedroom, and found that pair of underwear, which *definitely* wasn't there before our guests arrived. I confronted her and she confessed to setting my fiance up because she ""thought I could do better"" and she ""deserved him more than I did."""

"Most people my generation (Millenials) want to change the system, not give-up. Unfortunately, if you're not familiar with historical economics, then those two tend to look the same from the outside looking in.

We [""waste our time""](http://nyxelestia.tumblr.com/post/160569700478/msladyjay-avatar-dacia-organized-studies) on seemingly frivolous crafts or hobbies because we are trying to buck the system, which is derided for the [economic anxiety](http://nyxelestia.tumblr.com/post/140915914189/doctor-segmentium-lets-be-honest-though) it produces in older generations.

We were raised in a perfect storm to [engineer anxiety](http://nyxelestia.tumblr.com/post/151261928560/princeescaluswords-nyxelestia), and then are derided for having it. We have come up with ways to [cope with those anxieties](http://nyxelestia.tumblr.com/post/124352174825/thefairyknight-hinallie-thisisnotharmless), but to older generations who are not familiar with the background or reasoning, we just look rude.

And much like it was our parents handing out participation trophies that left us unable to handle genuine praise or criticism, it's [employers](http://nyxelestia.tumblr.com/post/159322432670/millennials-have-made-it-clear-they-most-want) who try to woo Millenials with stupid ""perks"" at work because they won't or can't give is actual benefits like health insurance, salary raises, or more vacation time - if we're using vacation time at all. Millenials are sometimes so scared of losing their jobs that they forgo vacation time, but this means either they try to indulge themselves more in their day to day life or just end up exhausted, making them look spoiled or lazy.

It doesn't help that [we often take much longer to reach the same milestones](http://nyxelestia.tumblr.com/post/128697950574/darvinasafo-baby-boomers-be-like) as older generations because we're doing so with much less resources or much higher barriers than our parents, and thus derided for taking too long (or questioning its need and trying to pursue something more useful, which also looks like giving up to the generations who weren't raised on fairy tales of geniuses dropping out of college, making something new, and becoming billionaires).

So we aren't giving up. We're just trying something new. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But the definition of insanity has often been quoted as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, and for many Millenials, that means playing along by the current system or following the established paths of life."

"If anyone can tell me how to get one of those old T-Mobile Razors (The type with no memory card) to connect to my mac and stay on (NO Battery) I have a picture of Death chasing a ghost. I am not kidding. 

Story: I used to work filming political campaigns in the New York/Westchester area. It was at an older building being used for one of the videos we were making and the owners jokingly talked about how it was haunted every time we heard something odd.

Fast Forward to me and one of the Camera Ops in the wind cellar and we both heard something sore past our heads. I snapped a few pics and what we saw on the phone was a once empty room. Now housing a black stone pillar in the center. A electrical blue spectral form of some sort fleeing a black robbed figure with its arm outstretched.

I am certain if I ever recovered this image it would make headlines. The issue is..I don't want to bring it to a store because this was my phone when I was a crazy 18 year old... so you know... I need to figure out how to recover these images myself. 

Update 1:
I received some helpful links I will be researching. Here is the said phone I used in case anyone has further input on how to obtain images. As it stands now the phone does turn on, I see the main menu but then it shuts off.

"Haha, damn. Then I must look suspicious as hell because sometimes I go into stores and forget what I'm there for or I just go in to see if there's anything I'd like, and most times I'm very indecisive so I walk around absolutely everywhere and look at everything and take my sweet ass time. Sometimes I just decide I don't want anything at all after all and just leave after spending so much time. That probably doesn't help lol

It's an automatic thing for me. No-idle laws mean that if I'm stopped for more than 10 seconds I could be given a ticket for air pollution if my car just idles there.
"I get what you're saying, and I did chuckle.  But actually you're hitting the nail on the head.

I don't have a gun, so you know I'm not going to shoot you.  (In the UK) you don't have one either so I know you're not going to shoot me.  That means you can get on with your innocent (or criminal) business without getting jumpy and shooty, and I can get on with policing without getting jumpy and shooty.  Winners all round and the crux of the argument against arming police over here.

I watch some of the footage from the US in horror at the way officers tackle minor things like they're dealing with Al Capone.  But then I remember that there is a far from zero chance that the person they've stopped for that minor offence may well have a gun.  I want to go home to my wife and kids at the end of the day, so I'd be handling those stops very differently if I policed in the US, and to be honest I'd be pretty jumpy.

There have been some really tragic stories recently and to be honest in at least some of them the police are undoubtedly hugely at fault.  But I also think they're working under difficult conditions and given the prevalence of firearms in the US it's pretty inevitable that innocent people will be accidentally shot by police.  I have a lot of sympathy for everyone involved.

"I really liked Biltong and Nando's and Castle Lager. Jack Parow is certainly an experience. But, the country is so bizarre. I was taken to dinner by my Cape Town colleague. She and her husband joined me for dinner. They joked about how, as a Canadian, I must feel like a fish out of water in Houston, Texas, due to the gun culture and culture of the US South. But I kept trying to gently point out that Canada and the US aren't all that different; that I couldn't get used to South Africa. When I suggested that we walk to get dessert, you would have thought I had said something outrageous. Walk? After dark? You're confined to your space in SA - your hotel, house, area. Don't dare stray from specified safe routes, especially after dark. Don't stroll. Don't fight with the taxi driver, even though a short ride is now 300R and I'm clear in the wrong area (On the M3 heading in the wrong direction before I realized what was up) - he'll either kick you out in some dangerous place or get some friends to deal with you. Don't do touristy things alone because you could get killed, if you're getting mugged one guy will grab you, another will point a knife (and may or may not stab you... 'cause) and then the third guy grabs your cash/cards. Apparently a very common occurrence, so much so you have security everywhere, even in restaurants (does Nando's really necessitate security?). I asked a cop for some walking directions from my hotel in Three Anchor Bay to Greenmarket Square (I was so cooped up, I needed to roam around) and he laughed, actually pushed his finger into my chest and very sternly warned me not to. Great. People in Cape Town go ""well, at least we're not Jo'burg!"" and everyone in Jo'burg goes ""Well, it's not as bad as Lagos!"" Like, really? That's your bar?

Cape Town is gorgeous, but you have to enjoy it from the safety and security of a very specific means of enjoying things. If you stray, you take serious risk. It's hard for me to watch Trevor Noah sitting in NYC waging his finger at the US when I've *seen* South Africa. South Africans are an interesting lot, but I found I just couldn't wait to leave; I didn't want to do anything outside of the city after colleagues got held-up by literal highway bandits. When I got back on the plane, I felt like I had the most surreal experience of my life and still no one over here believes me. "

Literally the worst pain you can legally inflict on another person.

Oh and don't forget those first few seconds of waking up when you don't remember whats happened. Best feeling ever, then swiftly followed by the worst when you realise sleep (when u can get it) is the only escape from the living nightmare."

"&gt; The ACLU isn't going to take a case that minor.

Sure they do. Lopera v Town of Coventry, for example. I don't know why you think police misconduct and the abject disregard for your civil rights is ""minor"" but I assure you they've gone to bat for the little guy plenty over ""little things"" like illegal search.

That's what exploring your options means, you don't assume, you reach out. Media, ACLU, law offices. Not even contacting anyone and just assuming there's nothing to be done is, again, exactly the same defeatist attitude that lets them think they can get away with violating our civil rights. So what if your evidence lacked? You even formally complained and basically got told to fuck off by the police department, that you should basically be grateful you were abused - the ACLU and media eat that type of story up, it's a narrative they can rally behind.

Even making the problem known can get the attention of the broader ACLU/media if it turns out that you're part of a pattern - that's how class actions start, this is how precincts come under a media firestorm. This means *even if* you don't get and win your day in court, you can still be making a difference, you can still effect change.

Edit - it's also important to note that ""the ACLU"" is not some monolothic entity, it's many regional state and local institutions. You're not reaching out to Disney's general counsel who couldn't give a shit about something that doesn't make headlines, you're reaching out to your neighbors who deal with the same cops you do. They are very invested in helping you and standing up for you, and there's a lot of people on the ground with you - landmark cases are just a tiny, tiny fraction of what the ACLU does.

How literally everything he does is to get back to her and save the world for his children, and how broken their relationship is because of it. And then in the last 30-45 she finally figures it out. [SPOILERS] her dad literally crosses dimensions and essentially gives his life (or so he thinks) so that SHE can be the one to save humanity and herself. The ultimate act of love from a father to his daughter, and how it came full circle for her. From hating her dad for abandoning her to dedicating the rest of her life to saving humanity because of what he taught her and did for her. 

I don't know. I see the points people have made about it, but as someone who's incredibly close to my dad, the ultimate love between parent and child really made the movie shine for me. "

When I was a teenager, in the winter my mother would make chili with cornbread baked on top. It was magical! Lots of meat, lots of beans, warm cornbread on top, my absolute favorite meal she makes. I was a teenager so I could put away more food than the rest of my family combined. So of course I went to town on it.
Well my dad and I had a Monday night ritual of watching wrestling and my dad would often fall asleep during it since it went till 11. After having the chili one night, I was feeling extra gassy and was just letting it rip since he had fallen asleep. We were in the basement so it just building thicker and thicker. At one point I notice my dad is twitching a little bit and it caught my attention. His face was just twitching almost like a dog or a cat when they fall asleep and are dreaming. Then all of a sudden he wakes up and yells OH MY GOD!!!! WHAT THE HELL!!! GO TO THE BATHROOM!!! And leaves the room to get out of the cloud. 
I woke my dad up from the dead of sleep with my farts. It was a proud moment for a teenage boy for sure. "

"I was an assistant teacher for a while (foreign language, high school) and a freshman died in a complete freak accident. Slipped and fell in the bath and hit his head the wrong way.

I didn't see that class very often, but my coworker said that when she did oral exams with the class (I forget the exact prompt, but they basically just had to talk for a few minutes in the foreign language), one of the students talked about the boy who passed away, and said they still missed his smile.

I just can't imagine how the parents must have felt. It's such an arbitrary twist of fate. How do you even react? The poor kid may as well have been hit by lightning.

A little less tragic, but at the other high school in town one kid ended up in the hospital and a bunch of others expelled because they were goofing off, throwing each other into the air or something?

"When I was growing up, a family friend who is a total lifelong gun owner and a real pro brought this ancient winchester rifle to the range he had recently bought and was really excited about it. He was obsessed with gun safety; I actually had been taught by him about firearm safety, as had several of my friends. He's a really good guy and tried to do absolutely everything by the book.

Thing is, he was firing this rifle and showing us how it worked, then he set it down on the stoop in front of him. Turns out there is a defect in that particular rifle that an even mild impact with a chambered round can set off a shot. 

Luckily, it just fired into the ceiling at the range. Still, the look on his face. He was just appalled. He put it down, demanded my friend's dad come and empty everything and put it away. From what I understand he spent many months before he went out to the range again. He just couldn't believe after all these years he had a negligent fire that could have hurt or killed him or any of us. I hope he doesn't still think bad about it, but yeah... at least he properly kept it not pointed at anyone, still, it seemed rough for him."

Few weeks later they found her car on the PCH intact with her keys inside and phone. No one at all , including the police, understands what could have happened. 

Her family has not given up but there have been no leads since they found her car. The boyfriend was cleared by policework after much time was spent to confirm that he really thought she went home after they hung out in the coast areas of Los Angeles. It terrifies me because I have sisters, and they are her age and I  knew this girl more or less, good kid. All i can really deduce is that there was malicious intent, but theres zero evidence. The police spent weeks canvasing the ocean to no avail. And no witnesses besides the boyfriend are named. She never told anyone about running away or problems she had.

"No, that's not how cows work. Cow udders are actually attached to wormholes, which lead to a pocket dimension which is shared by all cows. Cows eat 75-100 pounds of grass per day, which is obviously far more than necessary. The majority of the grass goes into another wormhole located in one of their stomachs, which is also why they have multiple stomachs. It then gets sucked into a black hole within the pocket dimension, reverting it to a primordial form. The cows can request material from this shared black hole from a neural link that binds all of their brains through the pocket dimension, and when that request reaches the black hole, hawking radiation is sent outwards into energy-to-matter hardware, converting it into a nutritious liquid, into the wormhole which leads to the specific udders of the cow who requested the material from the black hole."

"There are a couple fascinating UFO reports that interest me. Whether they were aliens in space crafts or secret government testing, it's still interesting. I think these are some of my favourite UFO reports (aside from famous ones like Roswell and the Phoenix Lights).

1989-1990 Belgium UFO Wave - I've heard 1300 people witnessed a triangular UFO across Belgium and there were a few pictures taken of them one is supposedly a hoax while the other is still unexplained. 

Disappearance of Franklin Valentich - While piloting a light air craft over Bass Strait in October 1978, the 20 year old pilot claimed he saw a UFO about 1000 feet above him. His last words recorded before transmission broke up was ""It's not an aircraft"".

Falcon Lake Incident - On May 20, 1967 in Falcon Lake, Manitoba a man named Stefan Michalak witnessed two glowing red cigar shaped object in the sky and one landed tasking on a disc form. Stefan sketched it on paper and thought it was a secret US military air craft so he approached it and upon hearing muffled voices, he called out if they needed help (Canadian confirmed), but saw weird lights and materials inside it as well and a panel with a grid pattern of holes. Suddenly a blast of air hit him and he was knocked backwards. Later when he went to the hospital, some burns he had appeared in the grid like pattern of circular holes he had seen on the panel of the craft that had appeared on his chest. Stefan was a military policeman in Poland before he moved to Canada making this pretty credible too.

Travis Walton Abduction - Probably my favourite UFO report is that of Travis Walton who was a logger and was with 7 of his friends in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona in November 1975 when they spotted a strange light. They got closer to it and pulled their truck over and Travis got out to approach the hovering light. Out of nowhere, the light shot a beam on Travis and he collapsed to the ground. His friends freaked the fuck out and got out of there. When they told their stories, police thought it was a cover up for murder but none of them failed a lie detector test. Travis was gone for 5 days before reappearing on the side of a road - missing but not before a huge search of the area found no trace of him. It's very weird stuff and very interesting to hear him talking about his story today. As you might already know, the movie Fire in the Sky is based off this abduction case."

It was the last day of school (I was 11 years old) and they had a really nice hog roast. It's the day where you get to show your parents your bits of work which get stuck up on the walls (pretty big thing for 11 year old me)

Anyway, I steal a bit of his pork scratching and this kid goes mental - I was really good friends with him as well, I thought he'd take the hint and try to take mine or someone else's and we'd all have a good scrap together.
Instead, we have a pretty full on dangerous fight on a pretty big staircase (low gradient but long) 
I get him down once and I'm on top of him, choking him out (I'd picked up judo at the time so I knew a little about submissions)
I feel that he's got no chance of getting out so I say ""we done here?""
He didn't reply but I let go anyway - he gets back up and attacks me again - next I get him down and into an arm behind back twisty thing and he's yelping and struggling - I see a teacher coming over and I thought we would get totally bollocked if we got caught fighting on the day where all the parents are in. I say to him ""stop, mr Hatton is coming over"" 

I immediately let go and act as innocent as possible, meanwhile, he recovers and as I'm talking to mr Hatton, he just punches me in the back of the head, reigniting the fight so much that parents had to split us up... embarrassed the both of us in front of basically everyone and I got sent home, didn't get to show my parents the stuff I'd done that year (big deal right)

Anyway, at the end of the holidays we come back to school and we're best mates again - another part of the brocode - forgive and forget."

"I biked across Canada a few years ago. It was absolutely the best thing for me at that moment. While on the road I met a guy who was walking across Canada. He had been through a rough divorce, been an addict, and was suicidal. So with nothing to lose he started to walk across Canada. I met him over a year into his journey. His walk wasn't a phase, it's literally his life. He has nothing more than what's on his back, and he is so much happier than he was.

If ever you feel you've come to the end, just sell all your stuff, and start walking/biking. You'll meet amazing people, see amazing things, and learn so much about yourself. You literally have nothing to lose. Hell, you can even take your cat. I met a drifter in a park who had a 20 year old cat with him. He picked up the cat a few years earlier because if he didn't it would die. Now they're inseparable."

So that's how I learned the lesson that everyone's alone
And your eyes must do some raining if you're ever going to grow
But when crying don't help, you can't compose yourself
It's best to compose a poem
An honest verse of longing or a simple song of hope
That is why I'm singing, baby don't worry, cause now I got your back
And every time you feel like crying I'm gonna try and make you laugh
And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad, then we'll wait for it to pass
And I will keep you company through those days so long and black
And we'll keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve
Of love's uneven remainders, our lives are fractions of a whole
But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall
Then I think we'd see the beauty, then we'd stand staring in awe at our still lives posed.

One day, he came in and pinched her ass. She just reached over and grabbed the frozen turkey off of the counter and beat the shit out of him until he passed out and she thought he was dead. She washed the turkey off, put it back in the freezer, and drank a beer while watching TV until the cops came. "

"Also: https://thebillfold.com/to-terry-pratchett-who-gave-us-sam-vimes-boots-theory-of-socioeconomic-unfairness-a33858c1c74c

""The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet. This was the Captain Samuel Vimes ‘Boots’ theory of socioeconomic unfairness.""

"**TL;DR: Incredibly credible relative swears Ouija board warned her that her husband had been captured in WWII.**

My great-aunt Dorris was a top-tier human being. Think a female Fred Rogers, right down to the quiet but deeply devout Christianity. Not the kind to make up wild stories -- I don't remember ever hearing her tell a lie -- and definitely *not* the type to dabble in the occult.

So you can imagine my shock when, one Christmas, Dorris gave me a Ouija board and encouraged me to use it with true-believer seriousness.

Once she'd left, I asked my mom *what the fuck*, and finally heard this story:

During WWII, while my great-uncle Tom was fighting in Germany, some of Dorris' friends were goofing around with a Ouija board and convinced her to join in. Once she did, the planchette spelled out that Tom's plane had been shot down and that he was being held in a POW camp in [very specific location]. The next day, she received an official notice from the military that confirmed every detail.

As bullshit as this story sounds... as little as I would believe it coming from *anyone* else... I know that it would take a truly extraordinary experience to get Dorris to believe in anything like that.

My only rational explanation is that one of Dorris' friends found out about Tom's capture beforehand and decided to mess with her mind... but holy shit, who could be that cruel?"

"Hired a young lady in her early 30s for a cafe counter crew position.  She was a bit odd but nothing major until one day.  She was closing with my son (14 at the time) and a second teen (16) both had worked at the cafe for two years at this point so she wasn't in charge or anything just sweep, mopping, cleaning, etc.    I run out to the store to get something for the next shift and was back in less than a hour.  During this time, son sent her home because she came to him crying and very distressed.  She told him that she had just had a miscarriage and that she needed to leave.  Son told her to let us know if there was anything we could do and to touch base tomorrow about her upcoming shifts.  I talked to her the next day and she was still upset because this was the fifth miscarriage she had had in a row....each month of her marriage.  Yes, she honestly thought that since she was having sex with her hubby that she must be having miscarriages vs. monthly periods.  This was the one that is the oddest for me to understand.  Nine years later --- we still wonder."

Being pulled over by a cop wearing a full ballistic vest and carrying an M4 full of attachments is probably scary.

"I used to rent out the basement of a friend's house. There was a neighbor that had a German Shephard puppy. My cat liked to sit in the basement window, and look outside. 

The puppy liked to run at my cat, and bark. Usually she stopped in front of the window, but one night she didn't stop. I saw my cat jump down from the windows, and suddenly the puppy came crashing through the window. There was blood and glass everywhere. 

The dog lived... she got stitches in her face, and had to wear a cone for a bit. The neighbor replaced the window, and my cat continued to taunt the puppy from the window. Fortunately, the neighbor kept his dog on a leash outside after that. "

"Oh, more than just that killed WCW. Russo was (and still is) an idiot who didn't know the first goddamn thing about booking wrestling. I don't know how he came to be seen as a booking genius from his time at WWF, but he somehow got that reputation. (Brawl 4 All was his idea, as an example of the sort of ideas he came up with.)

WCW was in utter chaos as well. Their roster was so unbelievably gigantic that very talented wrestlers were being not used at all or very underused in favor of more popular wrestlers who sucked or weren't nearly as good as the undercard wrestlers. I get sometimes popularity beats out skill. Hulk Hogan is a good example of this. But, by and large, if you let a talented wrestler have some time in the spotlight, he'll quickly rise to the top, or at least higher up on the card.

The issue with WCW is they were putting on crap matches and completely ignoring their talent. There's a reason Malenko, Guerrero, Benoit and Jericho all defected over to WWF. Malenko, sadly, didn't have much success despite arguably being the most talented of those 4 in terms of actual wresting ability (watch Malenko vs Guerrero from ECW sometime), but the other 3 made it huge. Well, Benoit really doesn't exist anymore as far as WWE is concerned, but he was big before that.

WCW had just too many problems to list. Listen to Jim Cornette talk about it sometime. As much as people think he's an old fogey who doesn't understand modern wrestling, he did work for WWF/E during the Attitude Era and was a firsthand part of the Monday Night Wars, so he knows exactly what went down."

So, I would answer a page of questions in each browser, browse reddit for 5-10 minutes, hit submit, answer more questions, and then kill more time on reddit.

- he started believing in God when a Russian soldier stood right in front of him (he beeing in a trench) . He made the sign of the cross and waited to die . But the Russian soldier experienced jamming. 
- the only time I saw him cry was when I drew a swastica as a kid of four . I didn't know what it meant and didn't understand why he was so upset . He just said : please don't ever draw that again . It's a sign for the worst in humanity. "

"A Canadian soldier named Leo Major once liberated an entire dutch town entirely on his own. During D-Day he captured a German half track, while taking some men prisoner a grenade went off and he lost an eye. He argued he could still use his sniper rifle with one eye and went back to service. Did something once where he took a large group of Germans prisoner. Then I think he hit a landmine and broke both his ankles, some ribs, and his back. Went AWOL from the hospital to rejoin his unit. He then proceeded to liberate an entire Dutch town on his own in one single night, killing all the SS in town and burning down the gestapo hq. The next morning the Germans surrendered when the allied forces showed up, apparently the Germans assumed the entire allied unit had invaded the town and went into hiding until morning.

Also Roger Bushell who organized the great escape: Was shot down and captured, made an escape attempt, recaptured and brought back to POW camps. Made another escape, with his partner he ended up in the Czech republic and was in touch with the underground. Was arrested shortly after the Heydrich assassination, tortured by the Gestapo and decided he was going to make life as difficult as possible for his captors. Is sent to Stalag Luft III. Dubbed escape proof by the Germans, and they put all their most troublesome POW's into the camp. Essentially loading it up with the craftiest escape artists in the combined Allied Air forces. Bushell decides hes going to get the entire camp organized to dig 3 tunnels simultaneously, which they do. One is discovered, the other is abandoned, and the last and longest one makes it. He wants 250 to escape, but the forged paperwork is all dated at a certain time, and they have to escape by the end of March 1944. It was still winter, and upon digging their way up realize they are short of the tree line. 75 men get out, only 3 make it back to allied territory and 50 (including Bushell) get shot to set an example. The perpetrators were all brought to justice at the nuremberg trials. The security on the entire operation was so tight, the prisoners used to keep track of what guards were on duty and what time they showed up, and it actually helped the Germans figure out what guards were skipping out on shifts or showing up late. It really is a fascinating story that I don't think the classic movie does enough justice for."

"I had seen plenty of things before this but this is what solidified it for me. 

I was 12-14 don't quote me on that. It was Christmas time and the whole family was at my grandparents (super rural Louisiana) house and I was staying in their fifth wheel camper since there wasn't any room in the house. It was about 2/3am and I heard their two Great Danes raising hell outside. So I looked out the camper window and saw them chasing a small black object darting back-and-forth leaving these dogs in the dust. Out of nowhere it darted fifty feet under a street lamp my grandfather put up next to his machine shop. Before I tell this next part I need to preface with This may seem extremely fantastical but I still get goose pimples retelling this story. With in a couple seconds it went from being about six inches tall to well over six foot bipedal. It was perfectly under the street lamp and I couldn't make out and real body features it was like looking at a shadow. It didn't have a face or didn't have on I could make out. It was terrifying. Then it got worse! It turned towards the dogs who are still barking. It arched its back and screamed at the dogs but it felt like it was coming from inside my head. The dogs ran yelping to their dog house.  Then it turned to me I was about sixty feet away from it and even though I couldn't make out a face or eyes I know it was staring at me I felt like someone had put ice in my veins. Then it run and cleared the rest of the yard (about 70-80ft) in less than a few seconds. I sat in the camper with every light on and a knife in my hand the rest of the night. 

The dogs didn't come out of their house for days after. when we would try and get them out they would snap at us. 

Now I feel I need to say this but I'm in no way a fearful person. I've had a knife held to my neck I've been shot at jumped and beaten... i have never felt this level of fear again I never have feared that I was gonna die more than I did in that moment. I grew up in those woods and have never seen anything like this before. I'm 27 and I've been afraid to go back into those woods ever since. I definitely don't leave the lit area around the house at night.

"The most simple advice I could give is to stop doing the thing where you walk up to a complete stranger and ask for her number. It's hard on you, makes her uncomfortable and rarely works unless you're a professional salesman or you're very attractive. 

Instead try something like, ""Hi, I'm [your name and a bit about who you are], I noticed you [something unique about her that got your attention]."" 

She'll probably introduce herself, then you can have a polite conversation about something she does/wears etc. preferably not something obvious she hears about ten times a day. 

When it starts to lag, ask ""Are you interested in getting to know each other?"" 
If she says no, ask if she'd like to take your number in case anything changes, no pressure. If she says no again, wish her a good day and move on. 

There are billions of women in the world and you just don't have the time to bother with one who isn't into you as well when some out there will be into you. Think of it as though you're sifting through them looking for the right one for you. Don't focus on the inevitable rejections. Just move on, keep looking. Idealizing one and putting her on a pedestal feels like you're honoring her, but if she's not into you it will just annoy her that you're fixating. 

If she says yes, exchange contact info and get to actually know her and eventually hang out a few times. Don't mention or hint at anything sexual until she does, play it by ear from there. 

If it never happens, you either don't click or she's low libido or asexual. If you're fine with that, great. You've found her. 

If that's a deal breaker, start over. The point of that approach is to come across like a human who recognized she's a human. Approach her brain instead of approaching her vagina. You'll be a rare man if you do so. 

This is advice for guys who want a relationship. My insight could possibly be manipulated to get hookups or one night stands but I'd rather it not be. "

"Probably the cost of international phone calls pre-1990s.

The price compared to the cost of providing the calls was beyond exorbitant...it was just a given that it would cost $1-$2/minute ($2.5-$5/minute in today's dollar) to call overseas and people just paid and made it quick because there was no other option.

It came out later that the price was artificially inflated and that while these calls cost the company more, it was nothing remotely close to the 20x, 30x, 40x the price customers were being reamed to call across the world."

"My grandpa owned some condos that my dad and uncles would fix up between residents, so as weird and extreme as that sounds, I understand 100%.

One of his first condos he bought cheap, probably due to the sheer amount of work it took to make it liveable and rentable again. It had been a total flop house, complete with an eroded bath tub, a bedroom spray painted matte black, and a bathroom door that had been splintered into oblivion by some kind of trauma (think ”Shelley Duvall on the inside screaming"" kind of bathroom door).

As a kid helping out, I took most of this in stride because I didn't understand drugs.  I was more fascinated by the beer can that had been pressed in its entirety through the drywall, and the closed pantry door still impaled by a broom handle, which had been driven through the door with so much force that it had left a hole in the pantry's back wall.

There was also something about his right to wear a hat in court because he was a free man and I have no idea, I stopped listening because I was laughing too loudly.

The predominant reason why sidewalks are increasingly not built is because of the cost. Neighborhood developers don't like to build them, and cities don't like to maintain them.

"Hey! Two things I can comment on. Most of Europe was land cleared millennia before the Medieval Ages. Taking just Britain as an example; the period of time where the largest % of Britain was cleared for farming was about 1000 BCE. Mainland Europe is thought to have been a couple centuries earlier, 1200 BCE or so.

Second, the forests of Europe and Central America impacted climate in very different ways. A European forest didn't have as much direct sunlight, and therefore didn't play as large a role in the water cycle. The loss of Central American forests for farming had a large impact on the amount and severity of droughts. Soil samples show that in the century before the fall of the Mayan Empire (900 CE) there were roughly twice as many droughts that lasted twice as long as the century after, when the forests had a chance to regrow. 

~Edit~ The direct sunlight captures more energy, evaporating more water to power the water cycle. And clearing a forest captures less energy than having a forest there. Forgot that part.

So, Medieval Europe clearing forests? No, think more clans with bronze axes about the time some Greeks were hiding in a horse being pulled into Troy. And drought kills people, and clearing a forest in Central America has a bigger impact on droughts than clearing a forest in Europe."

"A friend's grandfather either worked in or owned a hotel at some point. The building was hundreds of years old, dated back to the English Civil War.

Friend's grandfather called a medium to come check the place out and she freaked out at the nature of the supposed presence in the hotel. If I remember correctly, they found through later research that there had been some murder committed by three soldiers in the building during the civil war.

"I'm often hungry because I don't really keep food in the house. People tell me it's super unhealthy to only eat once a day, and go long stretches without anything but coffee. I'm not sure they're wrong but I don't change because I believe it's the only reason I'm still relatively thin. I'll roam the house for food at night but there's nothing easy-to-make in the cupboards so I don't eat anything. I'm afraid if I start buying more food and eating normally that I'll get fat."

"Oh god it was brilliant. First off, she was a parent to one of the kids who are in band just to fulfill the credit, you know? Of course she had no problem with cutting the rest of us off from our parents because her kid was with her, so the other parents would be fine right? 

Only problem is that our director NEVER checked his phone, like ever. Some parents tried to reach us through him and he didn't find out til after halftime. That's when he realized he was about to be in deep shit. The principal knew the rule was bull and knew the parents had real concern over it, so she ""gently"" reminded the chaperone of that and said that maybe it was best if she stayed behind next trip. We got the ""lecture"" so it wouldn't look like the principal was just bowing to the parents. "

"I went through the most difficult interview process with a company a few months ago. Went through a phone interview with a recruiter, came out for an onsite interview, had another phone interview with the regional, then brought out for a final onsite interview with said regional. In this time, I had to take time off of work and move things around in my schedule in order to drive out of my way to the other side of town. Was told I'd know if I got the job a week after the final interview. They finally sent me a generic email declining me after a month. Found a better job anyway in the end but still."

She was like ""lol k"" and put it in her daily planner, and never signed it.

I went back to school the next day and explained this to my teacher, and he yelled at me for ""blaming"" my mom for my mistakes. I cried. I went home and told my parents about this injustice, and THEY AGREED WITH MY TEACHER.

"Diocletian is another good option.  The ultimate pragmatist, and one of the only emperors to walk away from power voluntarily.  People who don't really want power tend to be the best at wielding it.

Hadrian's results weren't what he wanted but he was also intelligent and had his people's best interests at heart.  He wouldn't be a bad choice.  As a gay man, he definitely would keep minorities' interests in mind.

Napoleon Buonoparte is another good option--his organizational skills were second to none and he left Europe better than he found it from a government perspective.  Absent the distractions of actually having to win power, he would simply get down to the business of governing rationally.

Simon Bolivar, William Pitt the Younger, Thomas Jefferson, and Justinian I were all flawed men with tremendous organizational and/or leadership skills.  Any of these guys would be right up there with Bill Pullman when it comes to leading Earth's fight against the aliens..."

"I'm a terrible fixer. I want to fix every problem I see and I love giving advice. My sister used to yell at me all the time about it- ""I don't want you to fix this, I just want you to listen to me!""

I started volunteering with a children's grief group late last year and went through a lot of training to prepare me to facilitate the kids. And a huge amount of the training was about being a companion to the kids through their grief and not trying to fix it for them. It helped me a ton in dealing with friends and family when they have problems. I can sit and listen to them now and not immediately jump to trying to find a solution for them. My friend actually commented on how much she enjoyed talking to me after she broke up with her boyfriend because ""I was really good at it."" 

Thanks, Warm Place, you trained me well. My sister is a lot happier, too ;)"

"I can't remember the name of the book but it was a short one one communication styles and it basically said there are the ""one at a time"" communicators who wait for people to finish before speaking and the ""overlap"" communicators who interject. It's usually how you were raised. The funny thing is is that the overlap communicators expect interjections over their own sentences and view it as interest in the conversation. They'll keep talking until someone jumps in and cuts them off. If paired with a one at a time communicator, they'll just keep going because the one at a timer finds it rude to cut in, so they wait and wonder why they aren't being given a chance to speak. Meanwhile the overlapper is wondering why the other person isn't interested in the conversation.

I was raised as an overlapper. My family talks over each other constantly. We can have more than a few different topics being discussed in bits and pieces at any given time. None of us find it rude and we just start up where we left off when we get a chance if we're interested in finishing our thought. I'm sure it's viewed as pure chaos to people not like us, but it's just our way.

In my professional life I work VERY hard not to cut people off because it can be viewed as rude. But its never because I feel more important or dont care! I cut in because i DO care and want to participate. Sometimes I come across someone who cuts in like me and it's great to just have a ""normal"" conversation. "
I have the feeling he would be a great person to spend an evening with and would be quite a conversationalist. As long as there was something you were passionate about I bet it would be easy to get along with him.

"My mom could keep it together except in duress, so she had a lot of people convinced there was nothing wrong.  At the end, she had a lot of surgeries...after anesthesia, she would be insane for about a month.  Seeing ""dead"" people standing in the room...the worst was she decided to rip out a central line for no reason (with my dad in the room) and when all the nurses rushed in to stop her from bleeding to death, it took 5 of them to hold her down, and she started shouting ""RAPE RAPE"" and for WEEKS afterwards she insisted she was raped by 4-5 huge people.  There even had to be an investigation (the hospital takes ALL rape claims seriously).

But growing up, it was weird stuff JUST outside of normal.  The stuff you can kind of get away with and people think you're quirky.  Family members still refuse to acknowledge it, partially because (I believe) they feel complicit in not stopping her at her...worst, partially because they don't want to soil the memory of someone that can't defend themself.  I get that, but I think it was serious enough that it needs to be discussed, and I do a lot (through therapy).

The ""big"" incident...military punishment.  I was maybe 7 (I date this incident by the house we lived in, from age 6-9).  I was terrified of balloons as a kid, and they would intentionally go to restaurants like Red Robin and Fridays because they had balloons and they thought I'd get over it with exposure.  So we were visiting my maternal grandparents in Phoenix, and they take us to Fridays and we eat on the patio.  I'm at anxiety level 10.  Drinks come out...I'm fidgeting and have my head on a swivel.  I knock the table.  Drinks slosh, and it's a iron mesh table, so they drip onto people's laps.  My mom attests I picked up the table and threw it in a rage which caused the spill...it's a metal table big enough for 6 and I'm less than 9 years old, so do the math on that one.  She picked me up, took me to the van, and basically chanted at me for an hour ""You're a bad kid, you're going to hell where you'll be surrounded by your 3 worst fears forever...spiders, balloons, and the dark!  And you know what happens when balloons are in heat?  They EXPAND!!!!  Popping balloons in your face for all eternity!!!!""  Eventually everyone else came to the car, and we went home, and I was just told over and over that this whole thing is just beginning.  The next morning, my head was shaved and I was put on ""military punishment.""  I was forced to do hard labor, fed nothing but water and white bread on a plate on the floor next to the dog bowl.  I scrubbed floors and driveways with a toothbrush, I was forced to sit under tables silently for days, and everyone once in a while my mother would come in to dictate this huge essay to me that was just rambling on about how I'm a meaningless grain of sand to the mountain that is the world.  No other adults stepped in, but multiple signals were sent that everyone knew this was wrong...my grandmother told my sister ""sometimes we have to do what we think is best even if it seems wrong"" etc etc.  To this day my dad just won't even acknowledge the incident.  Then, we got in the van, drove back to our house at the end of the trip...and military punishment kind of just ended.  It fucked me up immensely.  My mom, many years later, apologized for it...she knew it was child abuse.  I got a complex about my hair for years, anything military is kind of a trigger for me (not like a whimpering trigger...just over the years, I think over time I selectively looked at the military like punishment, looked down on the people in it, looked at military force like bullies, that led to a pretty strong position against guns and firearms, redneck culture, southern culture, etc etc as my worldview expanded).  The family view of ""hell"" (fire surrounded by your three worst fears) probably led me to my atheism.

Sorry, long post...but yea, some fucked up shit...I think that story is outside the scope/intent of this thread as it wasn't even normal for our house...if it helps, I've been through like 15 years of therapy, my mom and I had enough lucid moments before she died that I am good with the closure (it was more of a ""I'm glad her suffering is over""), I'm a well-adjusted 34 year old with a great wife, great job, and 2 great kids.  Kind of a happy ending."

"I fully disagree with this. You can give people perspective to eventually change their minds, you can better understand your own opinions (it happens naturally when you spell them out), and you can also change your mind about things yourself. 

There's a TED (or TEDX?) talk by a Westboro Baptist Church defector, who basically said that if it weren't for discussions she had with people online who listened to her and replied civilly, she would never have broken our of her bubble.

The weird thing is she drove way up in NH just to get away from something that was troubling her back home. And when a passerby stopped to help she told them that AAA was on their way. But the passerby called the cops and only the cops showed up. So I think she planned her disappearance with a second person who picked her up. She had wrecked her car to add to the mystery. I bet she is alive and well living a secret life with someone deep in the depths of North NH which is a dark kingdom of woods full of dark places.
I agree. The reaction was “holy shit she’s actually dead.” IMO. I think i would have the same reaction if one of my friends were missing then someone tells me they found their body. 
"Also notice at the beginning of the interview he talks like him and the victim were practically great friends. The after it's announced a body was found he says something along the lines of ""I don't really know her. I have seen her around before but don't really know her.""

We figured the easiest lie to use was to say we were playing some black magic game and it burned the carpet because demons or whatever...

I imagine any other excuse like, ""Uhhh well we lit it and had it safe, and I dunno it just did this!"" would get questioned a bunch and called out. "

"I'd do something more subtle - like everybody dreams of the number 100, and then the next day, 99, etc. It would be interesting to watch how long it would take for people to realize the pattern in their dreams, and it would be even more interesting see what would happen when they realize other people were having the same dreams... first their family and close friends, until suddenly you see on the news EVERYBODY is having these dreams.

This was on his upper arm. 

Now this guy and my wife's friend were together about 8 months until March when she finally lost it on him and pretty much told him how obnoxious the feminism stuff was and pretty much called him out for only doing it because he thought chicks would like it. Him, being a 20 year old, grew out of feminism real quick, and now has some kind of tropical bird with a rainforest background where Hil used to be. "

"Ray Gricar.

Ray Gricar was district attorney in Centre County, Pennsylvania back from 1985 to 2005. He vanished without a trace one day in '05.

They found his car parked out near the river, and downstream they found his waterlogged laptop- minus its hard drive. They found that later, and the data in it couldn't be recovered. On his home computer, though, detectives found that someone ran searches on how to destroy a laptop.

They never found a body, though. His bank account was never accessed and nobody saw him again. 

Most intriguing, his jurisdiction included Penn State, and prior to his disappearance Gricar had been doing some poking around there. His target? Jerry Sandusky."

Decorating the tree when I was growing up was always a group effort.  Each ornament was either a gift or handmade or a family heirloom, and every year we'd all get to hang them on the tree.  It usually took all day, and the result wasn't the most beautiful tree, but it was a tradition.

When I got my own house and my own little family, I wanted to carry on this tradition.  The plan was that me and the wife and the kid would decorate the tree together.

My father in law and his girlfriend were in town.  He was cool.  She was a controlling bitch, and we made the mistake of leaving her alone in the house while we all went shopping.  We'd explained the plan to her, but when we got home she'd already finished decorating the tree.  Because she thought she could do a better job.    She was proud of her work, despite the fact that we'd explicitly told her that we wanted it to be a group effort.  "

"Before this thread goes too berserk here, scaring all the would-be travelers back into their sofa cocoon...there's a huge difference between a scam **existing** and truly being **common.**

I mean, one poster so far has pretty much said you can't take a taxi in any tourist city - and this is asinine advice.

Bad shit happens....but it happens at home, too, so be aware and use your brain but don't allow yourself to become so paranoid that you can't enjoy your vacation. 

So, instead of adding fuel to the fire, I will give you some actionable advice. 

My wife and I run a small hotel in Mexico and so we spend a lot of time with a lot of tourists, not just our customers but seeing tourists in town...and seriously, sometimes it boggles my mind some of the things people do. We've never had a guest encounter an issue but there have been plenty of times that I have to delicately tell people that they're pushing their luck.

The world is safer than you think. MUCH safer than you think. Even the places known for not being safe are safer than you think.

But part of staying safe abroad is exercising common sense to not make yourself a target:

- Leave your flashy jewelry at home. You're on vacation, not going to Cinderella's Ball. There's literally no better way to show potential thieves that you've got money than wearing a collection of jewelry that costs more than the average worker makes in a year.
- Love photography and so you've invested 2 grand into a camera? No worries, keep the camera in your day pack until you're actually taking a photo. Walking around with an item around your neck that costs the same as an OK used car will draw attention from people who can't afford a car.
- Divide your money out so that when you're paying for something you're not pulling out this giant wad of cash like you're winning at Monopoly. Keep your daily spending cash and backup cash separate.
- Don't set your bag/phone/anything of value down on the table/floor at a bar/restaurant. People do this ALL THE TIME. I just want to go up to people and be like, ""HEY! That's awesome that you feel so safe here in Mexico - but leaving your shiny purse/iPhone on the table while you go pee is stupid in Cleveland, let alone a developing country.""
- This one's tough as we're in a beach town...but be aware that most tropical destinations are actually pretty conservative dress wise so when you're not literally at the beach or the tourist strip along the beach, cover up. You don't need to wear a snuggie but with your mammaries out in full force you're more likely to draw extra attention to yourself. Plus it's rude when local culture is to keep beachwear at the beach.
- Have fun but be aware that getting absolutely shit-faced blitzed and staying out until 3am increases your odds of encountering a problem by a zillion. If you want to truly tie one on and go balls/ovaries to the wall, do so in a large group only. Virtually every story I hear of people legit being robbed start out with ""We were somewhere we shouldn't have been at 2am drunk...""
- Same goes for swimming drunk...people are afraid of Narcos but the number one killer of tourists is drowning.
- Don't do drugs. Like drugs? Great...do them at home with the druggies you know and love. Associating with drug dealers you don't know, in a culture/city you don't know, at the types of places where you can find drug dealers....well, this increases your odds of being a victim of a crime. Along similar lines to people getting robbed at 2am...most stories of people being legitimately hurt/killed *mysteriously* often involve some sort of drugs.

**Trust your instincts.**

I've traveled to dozens of countries over the years and have been in plenty of dicey situations....again, usually after grandma's gone to bed and with double-digits of drinks in me....but I always stay alert enough to NOPE out of any scenario that starts to look sketchy...and the time to leave is when it starts to look sketchy, not after you ""wait and see.""

But for the most part, I'd ignore a great deal of the advice listed in this thread...in general the worst scam you'll get done for is paying too much for a trinket or being ripped off an extra $5 in taxi fare. Nothing worth staying home over.

EDIT: All that said, I was once robbed while sleeping on a train in Italy, haha. Lost all my money, credit cards, ID, passport...it was pretty sweet. And I was essentially robbed, perhaps extorted is a better word, by the police in Moscow for literally doing nothing other than being an American in a taxi that was pulled over...so I guess I should also add that part of traveling does involve a certain degree of embracing the adventure ;)"

"I worked Toys R Us as a seasonal employee as well for my first job.

Told her I couldn't give her one because she had to have a ticket for it and there's someone in line with that ticket so if I gave it to her they wouldn't get it. She cussed at me forever. It sucked. People are not happy during the holidays. 

Then we absolutely had to ask if people wanted batteries with every purchase no matter what it was or we owed them a $5 gift card. People tested you on it too and I felt like an idiot.

"I was a junior in high school, and had qualified for our state cross country meet. My parents went to every meet I had, but my grandma had been diagnosed with cancer recently and her health took a turn for the worse the week of my race. My mother stayed in town, and my sisters and dad drove up to see me race. I was close to my grandmother and we would always talk about my races / gf's / grandma stuff. Anyways, the race is going on, and I am in this position where if I don't kick it in then I'm going to lose my spot on the stand. It was the last half mile of my three mile race. Now my sister had called my mother because she wanted to know how I was doing and to give her a play by play of the race.

I remember just saying in my mind ""fuck fuck fuck, gotta go harder, fuck you, push harder you fucker"" then saying in my mind ""give me strength so I can finish"" I was pretty out of it, the grass that I was running on was turning into a bright light, which isn't good. I kicked to the final hill to the finish line and collapsed right after the line from exhaustion. Now the crazy part. My mother had been asking my sister the whole time ""has he finished yet, has he finished yet"" and my sister responding not yet not yet. My sister told me that the second I crossed the line she said ""He's done! He made it"". Now the ultra crazy part, the second my sister said I made it, as my toe crossed the line, and I passed out, my grandma died. I don't know what this means but it happened and I don't talk about it very often because people think I'm crazy. But something was going on that day. "

And hacking isn't real time either. You spend weeks writing code to automate the attack and then fire it off. The computer does it a million times faster than you could."
When I was about 4 my grandmother passed away from ovarian cancer. Flash forward- about a few years ago my family and I participated in a 5k raising money for ovarian cancer research. After the race my family was walking back to our car when we walk past a few people who also just participated in the race. One of them looks up at me smiles and I could've sworn it was the face of my grandmother. The people were complete strangers but I couldn't shake the feeling that it was her. Never told my family about it but I still wonder to this day.

"I was the person who caused an accident like that, except 5 other cars were involved. Probably one of the worst days of my life but holy shit I took the blame, obviously. One of the cars involved was being driven by a woman who had recently lost her police officer husband and it had been a huge news story in my town. Her mother in law showed up, frantic that something had now happened to her daughter in law and grandson. But then she held me when I started crying and saying how sorry I was. I think about her a lot. Luckily no one was hurt, and I have become a better driver out of the incident, at least."

"I think it has to do with protection. A government or ""country"" provides protection from other governments or ""countries"". Think of like walled cities back in the day that needed those walls to keep out invading tribes/armies. 

Basically, humans are violent and like to kill each other so we sadly need protection from one another. Just look at all the indigenous populations that got taken over throughout history. It'd be nice to live in a peaceful utopia with no borders.....but it would probably be invaded and taken over."

- You guys are making this so hard on me, I'm all alone here in this city studying hard and you won't even provide mobility for me, you are the absolute WORST!!

Oh I wish my story ended here but there's more.... after he finished talking with his parents and was promised 25k and we all looked around obviously thinking he was a spoiled child.

"A lot of industries' pipeline looks like this.

1) Be very good at a job that requires specific skills, like engineering, finance, or computers.

2) You perform well, so they promote you.

3) Now you're suddenly in charge of people, but you have no idea how to be in charge of people. You're just really good at the particular skill and maybe know a lot of people.

In many white collar industries, you can get away with this to a certain extent because everyone under you is trying to please you in order to gain a better bonus and advancement. Of course, turnover will be high, but then again turnover would probably be high even if you were a stellar manager. Working under anyone like this is a total nightmare.

"This isn't a funny story, but it fits the bill well enough.

I had a friend in elementary/middle school who was honestly a very sweet girl. Unfortunately the house she came from was filthy, so she and her clothes and all her stuff smelled terribly. I never mentioned it but plenty of people did because kids are awful shits. Fortunately I'm obnoxious so people hated me more than her and that kind of drew some attention from her. I think that's part of why she could relax around me.

Anyway, her family was pretty fucking awful, even from the outside, before you knew the details. My mom would never let me spend the night over there, she always insisted this friend come to our house. She later told me it was ""So she could have at least one night once in a while to be in a quiet, clean house."" If only she'd known what the rest of the family was like. One time she did let me stay there. I don't even like to think about what I saw. To give you some idea how bad it was, years later the house was demolished, rather than renovated. It had earned a nickname in town (I'm not going to write it here because it would identify the family on the off chance the article about it is online somewhere). There were dead animals under furniture. Mold all throughout the walls. I didn't see those things when I was there, but I did see animal shit everywhere, trash, rotting food left out, and her dad's porn left openly on the computer.

But the really ""trashy"" stuff wasn't just that these people were literal garbage. It was how they treated their only daughter. I sat through a dinner where her parents discussed which brother they would take when they divorced. Not as a joke, they were actually divorcing. They said, in front of me, in front of my friend, that no no, the other one could take her. It was like watching a fucked up game of Hot Potato.

The day we went to an amusement park for her birthday her mother got angry over something, I can't even remember what. Something meaningless. While my friend was in the bathroom her mother just dumped on her. She sat there ranting to a bunch of 11 year old girls about some of the foulest things an adult can say about a child. And the other girls agreed probably because they were scared shitless of this woman. I know my friend could hear her mother, she was only a few feet away. To this day I can't imagine how people can be such filth. That family was trashy, through and through. I don't know how their daughter was so sweet and sincere."

One in NZ and one in Philippines. He also owns some Maori land which is part of a huge trust and there are rules around selling it etc. So the family has been in a legal battle for last 2 years to sort out his $1M insurance policy, businesses in Philippines, houses in New Zealand and family land. To make matters worse, he lived in Australia when he was young and got an Australian passport. 

I was talking to MIL last week and she said, the insurance company has decided to give majority of the money to his girlfriend in Philippines and the rest is still going through court.

I got out of the house and started to look for them (even though they had taken their cars) then suddenly, a man starts walking towards me. I stop, thinking I could ask for help. As he approaches, I see several men behing him grinning. He smelled like cheap whiskey. He comes to me and says ""Little girl, what are you doing all alone here, want me to help you?"" At this point, I was shaking because I realised he was drunk and his friends were not looking friendly as I say ""no thank you"" he grabs me and starts saying that he WANTS to help me. Idk how I did it but I managed to get out of this grip and run. He starts running, they all do. I wasn't far from my house. I manage to get in and close the gate. They were about to get in until they saw my 3 dogs barking and showing their teeth.

"Do not go gentle by Dylan Thomas

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day,
 Rage, rage, against the dying of the light,


Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they,
Do not go gentle into that good night,


Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright,
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage, against the dying of the light,


Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learned, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night,


Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight,
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage, against the dying of light,


And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears I pray,
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light."

"That sucks. I begged my wife for a 30g iPod video for my 30th birthday. She came through with a beautiful black iPod, and it too is one of the best, most useful gifts I've ever received. I still use it daily as I find it cumbersome to constantly switch between photos, videos, apps and music on my smartphone as everything competes for storage space. All the music goes on the iPod, I can listen to it with headphones, plug it into my car stereo, I have a job site boom box that I can plug it into if I want tunes while I do yard work or if I go camping. 

The only hardware issue I've had is the battery eventually crapped out. A quick google search for aftermarket iPod batteries, and the thing works as good as new. I love it, and I'll always use it. "

I had just started dating this person for a couple of weeks when I went to a blood drive. The question asked* to click a box if I or my partner has ever engaged in homosexual anal sex relations.

But I didn't technically *know* whether my new SO had ever done that, and he'd said something about a threesome involving another guy, so I told them that I couldn't answer the question with certainty, and they asked me to leave. I follow up with my SO, now my ex, and he says that he'd never engaged in such relations. So, after that, I follow up with the blood donation place and they say, ""Sorry, it doesn't really matter that they didn't actually do that, you can't donate blood until after you stop dating that person."" That just seems arbitrary and irrational to me, and I haven't followed up."

"Not OP, but I had LASIK done a few years back.

If you can afford it, do it. There is no feeling in the world like waking up and not having to “put your eyes in”. You can just go to sleep without worrying about your eyes. You can wear sunglasses without making yourself wear contacts, and you can always wear whatever you want on your face since nothing is in the way.

That doesn’t even say anything to the money you will end up saving over the course of your life with not having to pay for glasses, contacts, or eye doctor visits as frequently as you do now.

The risk is essentially negligible, the operation is 5 minutes long, and you see the effects within 24 hours (it only gets better). Plus, my LASIK team gave me a “lifetime warranty” on my eyes, so they can and will fix anything if my eyes ever get messed up.

Every single day since my surgery I am thankful I had my eyes fixed (I even had pretty bad astigmatism). Worth every single penny."

At the end of the day such a futuristic system would surely figure it out.

Try jerking off to a lady that looks just like Natalie Portman without Natalie Portman popping into your mind anyway. Nobody has such control. The system could easily detect that you are in fact jerking off to her.

As for ""passing thoughts"", such a futuristic system should be able to detect whether it was a passing thought. Just because you remembered you have to give your work report to that fat secretary in the middle of a jerk-off session, doesn't mean you are jerking off to her.

Stop trying to cheat. The system detects whether you jerk off to someone or not, that's it."

Sure, I also watched this and felt a weird vibe, but I too know that my reaction to a colleague dying would be of shock and apathy, simply because I don' show my emotions all that much, and for outside viewers, this can easily be seen as someone who's atleast sketchy.

You're right about this particular case, but if this was unfolding in real time, would we really wanna jump to conclusions? Specially if we were seeing other witnesses interviews, in the face of death, there would be too many variables and people reacting in the most weird ways.

"When the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Nintendo Wii rolled out years ago I made an observation that I would probably always have a current generation Xbox or Playstation, but not necessarily both.  However, I would always have a current generation Nintendo, because their games are so niche and different that you can't get a similar experience on either the PS or Xbox consoles.

Nintendo, and many of their game producers, know how to make games that are just simply fun.  I love gritty, deep games as much as anyone else, but when I have friends over nothing is better than games like Mario Kart, Mario Party, or Diddy Kong Racing."

"They're talking more of investing in a retirement fund. A 401k or Independent Retirement Account, these are both structured and safe investments, where your money will grow by itself, tax free, until you retire/pull out. It's basically free money.

The only catch is you don't have access to that money while it's growing. You can't pull from your investments early, or else it will take a penalty. 

This means, just find a portion that you feel comfortable squirrelling away from each pay check, and do it. When you get a raise, put half of it towards the retirement, if possible. This will insure that you don't have to work forever, and you won't have to worry about money when everyone else is still trying to claw together financial security in their 40's/50's.

I'm 25, I started investing in my 403b when I started my new job 2 years ago. I put about 5% of my paycheck in, and I've already almost have 25k in there. By the time I retire, that 25k will have grown to the tune of ~~50k~~ 500k, on top of all the rest of the money that has been dumped in there and gained interest. This is how millionaires are made, and anyone can do it.

They also made us wear our school colors in any combination of t-shirt/shorts but as a 6 ft. tall girl finding any type of shorts that were even remotely long enough while still being socially acceptable was hard so my mom found and bought me a pair of light orange shorts. One of our school colors was yellow. Honestly, the shorts were just a smidge darker than our actual mascot color but it didn't fly with my teacher. Other girls were wearing neon yellow which was so off from our color and that was considered totally fine. It was just the fact that mine were technically orange.

So yes, some people will act this way but to me that's not normal. I need a relationship that's more independent. I have my hobbies and friends, I need my alone time to do those things.

"This will probably get lost but I honestly have wanted to tell someone about this for years. 

When I was younger I was walking my dog in these large fields behind my house. I was about 16/17. 
It was late at night and I was walking back to my house and it was also really dark. 

My dog was off the lead and he usually kept close, suddenly he stops, his attention diverted one way, then bang he had ran off. He didn't go that far though because I could still see him when he suddenly stopped despite how dark it was. 

Next to him was this bizarre shape on the floor, with four long legs that bent out at weird angles. 

It was honestly not like any animal I'd ever seen and because of where I live there's never been a report of some wild animal roaming free before. 
I feel like it was staring at me but I couldn't tell. 

I called for my dog and suddenly this creature turned around and ran back in the opposite direction too me. At such lightning speed it was sickening. 

I never, ever told anyone.

"A friend of mine of was curious how often city/campus police actually checked the parking meters.  He started parking at a meter, unpaid, and kept track of how often he got a ticket.    
  
I'm winging the numbers a bit here, because it's been over ten years, but parking for classes at a meter was something like $5 or $10, and he'd have to go back and feed the meter between classes.  But a ticket for one day was only $50 or so.  There may have even been a discount if you paid your ticket, uncontested, in a day or two.  
  
Basically, if he got a ticket less than once a week, it was cheaper to not feed the meter.  
  
I think he got two or three tickets *all semester*."

"Kitsune no Yomeiri! me, too! In Japan, for anyone reading who isnt familiar, foxes were once thought to be trickster shape shifters and there are lots of explanations as to why sun showers are called ""Fox weddings"". That they make it rain on a good day so people won't go up into the mountains  and disturb the wedding is one. Another is that the wife is a human who was tricked into marrying a fox and cries. Another is that sun showers seem sort of impossible, like a fox getting married.

Related, kitsune no Yomeiri can also refer to spooky ghost lights, as if lanterns are passing for a foxes wedding procession.... If I remember correctly!

"Bros before hoes is bullshit sometimes. It honestly depends on who your friends are. When I started dating my gf, I realized that my one friend was just toxic to me growing as a person.

For some reason, I just accepted it as being ""bros"" until my gf came along. This girl saw something great in me, treated me well and made me feel great about myself when I was with her (also, sex). So I started hanging out with her and realized how much of a piece of shit my friend was. Of course, he didn't like not having his punching bag around because now other people started to realize there was really nothing to him. He sucked. Then his relationships crumbled as I started being my own person. I really do feel like certain shit happens for a reason. "

She hugs me. The kind of hug you get from your grandma when you hurt yourself as a kid. She asks me what kind of coffee I drink and leaves to go get it. Comes back and puts it in my hand and asks me if I want lunch.

She is a terrible mother unless supervised. Simply can't keep her temper around her 3 year old child at all.

Also had to explain to her that no, force feeding your child a full 
 second meal, to her protest, because her father ate some chips (Fries for you americanos.) from her plate on her first meal, is not rational or healthy for the child.

One: They're disposable. If they judge you or are given any information that could leverage in your life, it doesn't matter, because they're not in your life for long. This is a nice bit of security.  
Two: They're outside observers. By presenting them with just the information relating to the issue, without a heap of context that all of your friends would have and consider, you can get less biased answers.  
Three: They're different. People in your circle may be very similar to you, and offer no advice that you haven't already considered. Those from other walks of life may have an advantage stemming from their unique experience which would otherwise be unavailable if you just stuck to your group."

"Used to work at a relatively upscale theater. Two middle aged couples came together a few minutes after the show in the mainstage began. We told them to wait until a certain time in order to enter the theater. They obliged, waiting around for a bit, hit up the bar, and chatted with us. They seemed like relatively normal middle aged people. The house manager came out and informed them that, at request of the production company, we actually couldn't seat them in their normal seats because they were in like the second or third row.  She offered them seats in the balcony (all the seats were the same price). One of the men freaked out, got in a shouting match, swearing and threatening loudly that ""they were going to go to their seats whether you like it or not!"" accusing us of being thieves, etc. He had a total temper tantrum and it wasn't even our fault, it was the production company's (which was headed by the main performer, who had a little cult following and all the people revered as a ""genius""). Anyway, the man threatened to enter the theater, but we prevented him, so instead he declared that he was going to talk with the box office. We let him. They refused to give him a refund, which was our policy. The whole party left, with the temper tantrumer yelling at the top of his lungs, ""This theater sucks!"" (keep in mind, the show was onstage at that moment) before he stormed out of the building, his wife and friends in tow. Never have I seen a grown adult suddenly resort to having a hissy fit and acting like a 5 year old. It was like a transformation. I felt bad for his wife and the other couple-- they seemed embarrassed. Funny thing is, they could've seen the show and only missed like 10 minutes of it if they had just taken the balcony seats. Instead, they didn't see the show and ended up wasting 4 tickets that were about $60 a pop.

TL;DR: Guy couldn't sit in his seat to see a musical, freaked out and had a temper tantrum."

"Screw the throwaway. 
My dad was violent and physically abusive all through my childhood. There wasn't a single day I can recall when I wasn't screamed at, punched, kicked and used as a human ashtray.
For my 14th birthday, he went out fishing and came back late at night. When I complained (as was my right, selfish as it was) he punched me in the face and told me that I was an accident. 
The fucker even cited my birth as the reason he wanted a divorce a few years ago. 
My mum thinks it only started when I was a teenager but in truth, it only got worse as I started to stand up for myself and fight back. If she knew how long it really went on for, or how badly I was beaten, it would break her. So my family will never know. "

"ITT Tech is a for-profit ""university"" (read: scam to bilk poor people out of their money by preying on their dreams of a better life). Tuition is astronomical for a degree that's completely worthless because institutions like ITT Tech are almost always unaccredited. Not to mention the ""degree"" is often unattainable because they change the requirements out from underneath the students, so at the end you're $100k in debt with no chance at a job in the field you ""trained"" in and a sinking sense of inadequacy and existential dispair."

Canada pays about 3%. Medicare is about 3%. So is Medicaid. And Veterans Affairs. And the British NHS. 

American general insurance? Overhead rate is about TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT. 

But that's OK. They need to pay for more things. Like advertising. And incentives to get you to switch. And incentives for doctors to switch, or go exclusive. Oh, designing custom forms. To go in their custom system. Which of different from the custom system in the next state over that's literally ten minutes away. Debt collectors. Lawyers for the inevitable court cases.

i cannot recall a single time in my life that the increase of tax has given me additional, or even improved, services. there are some that im sure have helped some other people, but all taxes are fungible so i really have no overview of how the distribution is, and i have extremely little faith in the government as a service.

frankly i feel like im just paying off the mob to leave me alone rather than paying for things around me. more like we are paying them so they can keep their business flowing. schools and roads are about the only thing i commend them for. feel like we pay enough for them to cover those.  we have a weird blend of overwhelming size of government, combined with the old capitalist ""fend for yourself"" infrastructure where unless you are failing significantly in life, you dont really get any ""handouts"" (aka - services for the money that gets paid in) from it. paying taxes into that seems futile for our own wellbeing, and we can only afford to spend so much for the welfare of others since its pretty hard to get by in general, especially when we had to fend for ourselves and take on 20 years of debt to just to get established - thank god for those ""low interest"" loans the government is nice enough to provide us with.

Women's toilets are a whole other level of gross: the hoverers get pee/shit/blood everywhere (Seriously, just sit down. You aren't going to get a disease, or sully your pristine bum); they perfume-bomb the toilet stalls and everything else in the facilities; they leave their kid's shit-filled diapers on the counters, they dye their hair in the fucking sinks, they make a huge mess and get water everywhere, and soggy paper towels everywhere but the garbage; they get makeup powder all over the counters (which creates a weird sludge all over the counter when it mixes with the water)...

I asked when we could meet next, and basically he said we'll meet next once I've sold Amway subscriptions to 10 people or something like that. I was extremely desperate for the other job, and I knew nothing about the field, nothing about multi-level marketing, so I got a little deeper in.

That it was a miracle of nature. He said he had pumped some water out the hose into a bottle, took it to the water company, and they said it was potable. He asked for investment money so he could start a bottling company out of his house through the magic hose. I explained that naturally the water company would say the water was fine because it came from them in the first place. The dude was dense and couldn't understand that that wasn't it and that it was the hose that had purified the water. "

"One that I haven't made yet. It's been something that's haunted me for the last 3-4 years. I need to apologize to my two former room mates, M and L, for the way I just disappeared on them. They were a couple, engaged, and they were some of the nicest people that I've met. We had mutual interests and hobbies and jobs, and I thought of them as my good friends. 

At the time, I was about to lose my job and was going through pretty bad depression. I think one day I just kinda packed my stuff and left. I think I might have left them hanging on a month or two of rent that I couldn't afford to pay in a very expensive apartment.

I stopped talking to them completely afterwards. I don't remember if they really tried to communicate with me either, but with the way I left, I don't blame them if they didn't. What surprised me, however, was that they invited me to their wedding. I couldn't face them. I didn't reply to their RSVP. I later saw pictures of their wedding on facebook, and they looked lovely. 

I need to apologize for the way I left their life, for the way I saddled them with the rent, for not attending their wedding or even congratulating them on it, and for not speaking to them or ever giving them an explanation for what I did.

My life right now is still a mess, and I still don't have the courage to face them, but I'm making some progress. Maybe at some point in the future, I'll feel confident enough to make this apology for real. They don't need to and I don't expect for them to accept it, but this is something that I need to do, if only for myself, to remove this guilt in my heart."

That's not to say I wouldn't think about taking the job.  Tripling my salary would be great.  But I'm not sure I would last 6 months before I get fed up and walk out.  For that reason I'd likely earn more over a career where I am currently while also being happier.

edit: OP doesn't specify what position at mcdonalds.  At that salary maybe I'd be a VP at corporate?  That may end up being more stressful/longer hours."

"Similar situation. Kid in elementary school was a year younger than me. Him and his sister were religious, I believe Hindu or Muslim, I'm admittedly not sure which. But whatever it was, they must have used weird soaps or food or something, but they always had a really strong odor. The little girl was quiet and nice, so kids mostly left her alone, but the boy was mouthy so kids picked on him on the bus a LOT. They were honestly ruthless, kicking his seat, calling him curse words, etc. The more he tried to stand up for himself, the worse they were.

I never really joined them, but I wasn't really nice to him either. I remember he went to sit next to me once and I put my bag down and said something like, ""Go away, asshole."" They eventually moved and I forgot about them. My senior year of high school, they moved back, and the boy was in my AP Biology class. I was hit with waves of guilt every time I saw him, even though he didn't remember me. Eventually I got the courage to apologize to him for never being nice or standing up for him, and he was really chill. His family had been very strict about his religion and he'd been very stuck up about it, which is why he got bullied so bad. Regardless though, he didn't deserve to be treated like that. Glad he's doing well."

"Driving slow in the left lane to prevent others from speeding.  

This morning, this douchebag that I see a lot on my commute drove for about 30 miles in the left lane, pacing an 18-wheeler just to prevent others from speeding on the highway.  He forced people to pass the 18-wheeler on the right if they wanted to go around.  He caused traffic on the highway to back up for miles and miles behind us because 2 of the 3 lanes were going the exact same speed.  This is dangerous because big trucks can't see to their right very well.

Now I'm just going to rant about this dud for a bit.  Please feel free to quit reading.  This dickhead, if you and he are the only ones on the road, will stay in the right lane until you change to the left to pass him.  He will then signal and changes lanes to the left lane at the same time you are.  So, you will hit your blinker to get in the right lane to pass him and he will follow suit and change lanes in front of you again.  He will continue to do this until you either swerve around him on the shoulder or just resign to the fact that you're stuck behind him.  If traffic is heavy and he can't play the lane change game with you, he just does what I talked about above.  He gets in the left lane and finds the slowest person in the right lane to pace and won't let anyone around.  If he recognizes your car, he will single you out by trying to cut you off when you approach stop lights.  He is the bane of my commuting existence.  He is the only person in the world that I truly hate. "

"On this last Monday night, four girls were involved in a single vehicle crash outside of Pittsburgh. One of the girls posted on social media the trashiest shit I have ever seen. They drove around all night while passing around a vodka bottle (including the driver) and visited numerous bars. At one point, one of the girls is seen pissing out of the window of a moving vehicle. They picked up one 17 year old before the driver, who was speeding, smashed her car into a pole and killed herself and two of her friends (including the 17 year old who just got in the car). The driver left behind a three year old. All of their social media profiles indicate they were some of the trashiest people around.

I'm yet to lose my little boy, but I'd imagine when you finally find your kid, every primal instinct is screaming out to hug and comfort vs teach a valuable lesson.

"Her comedy is pretty hit or miss for me and I can see why it wouldn't be to some peoples taste. That's fine, people have different tastes. 

But people act like she's like the worst person/comedian ever and blow it way out of proportion. They get mad and pop their lids and act like they're personally offended because a chubby woman made a sex joke that didn't appeal to them. They will go on long rants and post a million memes about how she MUST BE STOPPED!!! SHE'S RUINING COMEDY!!! TOO LOW BROW!!! but then turn around and laugh at other low brow comedians like Jim Norton or Tom Segura (who I actually really like, Your Moms House is great! #waterchamp #BIKES!!! but you have to admit that a disproportionate amount of his comedy is toilet humor) or post really low-effort shit on reddit. 

I don't like Bo Burnham very much. I don't feel the need to go on rants about how much I hate him or how he and his fans suck. I don't need to post memes or photoshop him in over the top positions. I don't make violent comments toward him. And I'm not hypocritical about it. I just don't watch his specials or pay attention to him.

If you don't like Amy Schumer that's completely okay, everyone has different tastes, but at this point, I find the people who complain about her constantly more annoying than any joke she's ever made. "

"Yes, this is the first time I've seen that and its pretty obvious that something of that nature is happening. 

At first it seems like she's running from someone. But the video goes on for 3 minutes, and eventually it becomes obvious that if you were actually trying to hide from someone, that elevator is probably not your best choice. In the 3 minutes spent trying to fix that door, she could've put quite a bit of distance between herself and whoever she seemed to be running from. 

And then she started making very weird gestures to....no one, and acting erratic and kind of insane. 

The most logical answer here is some sort of mental break, or some sort of deliriant/hallucinogenic drug. 

That, and the fact that the elevator was broken. Honestly that might have been what pushed her over the edge. Have you ever eaten mushrooms and then ran into a similar situation where something malfunctions? Instead of ""huh, I guess the TV is broken"", your whole world seems to come apart and nothing makes sense anymore. In reality you probably didnt have it on the right input.

"My former stepmother. I no longer recognize her as my stepmother because my father is dead. If he hadn't died the way he did (cancer) and when he did, I would have been hard pressed that she had a hand in it. 

However, he died ""too early."" What I mean is... he died less than 10 years after my grandfather died. 10 years after my grandfather's death is when his money was to be open for access by my father. Instead, my dad died 9 years 11 months (to the date) after my grandfather died, so his money was never allowed to leave the bloodline. Which means it went to me. 

My stepmother did everything in her power to get my father to turn against me. She succeeded to because, before my father's death, I hadn't spoken to him most of my adult life. She was trying to get it to where my father wouldn't leave me a cent of this money that he was set to inherit. 

Of course, once my father died before my stepmother was ready, her whole attitude ""changed."" She tried to play nice, tried to weasle her way back into my life, with her hands open. Claims she should get ""something"" for taking care of my sick father on his deathbed. But she kept my father on his ""deathbed"" via tubes and power cords to try to stretch out the end of his time. In the end, the doctors told her it was cruel to do to my father and that he was ready to go. 

When I refused to hand over the bank account to her (because I couldn't, even if I wanted to) she resorted to stalking me and harassing me. When that didn't work, she tried sticking her son on me to ""woo me over."" She seemed to have forgotten that she told me he had a warrant out for his arrest and all I had to do was ""set up a date."" Instead of me showing up, he was greeted by police officers. 

She finally gave up after she found some hotshot lawyer with loads of money to care for her. It's only a matter of time before she sucks him dry, I fear, but I haven't heard from her in over a year and that's a win in my book. 

If she had been smart, she would have read my grandfather's will. While the money is mine, yes, I cannot touch it straight away. I got a small portion when I turned 30, but have to wait for the next when I am 35 and the rest at 40. The portion I was able to touch when I first inherited it I put towards putting myself through college. I'm nearly done now, and once I get a job, I plan to never touch that money so my children can benefit from it.

The father who hired in-game assassins to kill his lazy son's video game characters
23-year old Xiao Feng doesn't want to get a job. He'd rather spend his time playing video games. To discourage this activity, Feng's father hired players to hunt down and slay his son's characters.

Unhappy with his son not finding a job, Feng decided to hire players in his son's favorite online games to hunt down Xiao Feng. It is unknown where or how Feng found the in-game assassins—every one of the players he hired were stronger and higher leveled than Xiao Feng. Feng's idea was that his son would get bored with playing games if he was killed every time he logged on, and that he would start putting more effort into getting a job.

"The money that was found on a river bar known as the Tena bar which is in this general area https://www.google.com/maps/place/45%C2%B043'05.3%22N+122%C2%B045'34.1%22W/@45.7181442,-122.7607669,366m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d45.718142!4d-122.75947 You can see the shed referenced in this picture: https://citizensleuths.com/images/Pictures/DredgeOverlay_lrg.jpg from this site https://citizensleuths.com/tenabar.html there. 

The serial numbers did match and were authenticated by the FBI, and was approximately half the money. It was significantly deteriorated, like it had been either underwater or buried that entire time.  That area recieved dredge tailings from several areas in the columbia river before the money was found, so it was possibly somewhere else in the river at one point, and redeposited there. That location is about 5 miles from my house. 

My theory for this one: DB cooper, who may have been a worker at the Tektronics Oscilloscope factory (they regularly worked with titanium and rare earths, were located near the portland area and designed equipment for Boeing, including specialty test equipment for aircraft) They take off flying north, pass ridgefield, DB cooper jumps, but looses the bag with the money into the columbia or the lewis river. He survives, but is now without the cash. He escapes to a car or some other vehicle nearby and somehow evades law enforcement,  destroying the parachute at a later date or selling it back into the used parachute market so there are no odd parachute pieces out of place to find. Without the cash, he never spends any of the money to get caught, and as the crime was believed to have been a targetted message to someone, never engaged in criminal activity that was linked to that hijacking again.

"Not terrible, but definitely the weirdest. 

So for some backstory, I lived in a house my dad owned and my ""rent"" to him was getting good grades at college. So a friend of a former boyfriend at the time needed a room, let's call him Horacio.  Horacio moved in to the basement area, and all is well, except lo and behold I realize I'm going through groceries at an alarming rate. So I stop buying groceries, and only ate at friends' houses or went to my folks for dinner. One day I came home from class and Horacio is drinking a bottle of ranch dressing. I asked him wtf, and he just said ""there was nothing else to eat.""

Another story from that time period, my then boyfriend (not horacio's friend) worked at a liquor store. They had a bottle of clear liquor break at the store and he rescued it and put it in a sprite bottle, which he brought to my house and stuck in the freezer. A few days later, I logged into my livejournal account to read a passive aggressive post about how you shouldn't put vodka in a sprite bottle because someone might be sick and drink straight out of the sprite bottle and then apparently vomit all over the kitchen. My thoughts were if something is in the freezer and not frozen, it should be relatively clear it's not sprite. Also, who drinks straight out of a 2 liter container when it isn't yours?

"Dude never showered for weeks on end. When he did shower, I doubt he used enough soap to actually get clean. We lost the security deposit pretty much solely because of the stench that was embedded in his room. One of the local game stores put ""NO SHIRT, NO SHOES, NO SHOWER, NO SERVICE"" on their door because of him.

Would regularly get shit on the toilet seat and never clean it up. This was actually my breaking point, and he retaliated by claiming I didn't pay a fair share of bills (which I did... He just never paid them on time and racked up huge fees, which we refused to pay for since we paid him on time). Never acknowledged the original issue, which was his poop on the toilet seat.

Once he had such bad diarrhea he used a towel to clean himself up and then left it on the floor of the bathroom. Apparently I passed by the restroom when it happened, he had a towel wrapped around his waist and he was running to get something, but I have no idea what since he just used the same towel to clean up.

His fetishes.... Had women's wigs and fake breasts (I never knew they had such a thing as a single canteloupe-shaped rubber titty but he had one, just chillin on his bed with his door wide open), of course women's clothing, also adult diapers and the adult baby stuff. He wrote really awful comic scripts for some website which revolved around women with ridiculously huge tits. I mean, whatever floats your boat man, but please don't share and talk about this shit with me like it's a totally normal thing for everyone. Made me super uncomfortable, especially since he professed his love for me to my boyfriend and to me.

We found out about some of these when we set up a home network, and he made some of his pictures available of him wearing said wigs and fake titties and baby things. Not that he tried to hide the items anyways, but seeing him wearing it was pretty shocking.

Always thought everything he did was perfect. Played card and board games and threw fits when he lost. Huge tantrums, he would literally storm out of the room and not come back out for the rest of the night.

Not at the house, but:

He had a large boil on his back when he was starting a new job. It started to leak and it stunk up the entire room. He insisted he was OK to stay but they forced him to leave and take care of it.

Tripped over his desk drawer at work (which he opened and left open) and threatened to sue the company.

Someone burned popcorn in the work kitchen and he claimed he was having an asthma attack, started yelling and causing a scene and was again asked to leave.

That's all we really care to remember at this point..."

We actually had to read that book in class when I was in 8th grade. By the end of the book I was crying so hard.

"&gt; It's a person who claims they didn't choose to be a part of the country they are in

Well this is where they're not really wrong. In many ways their basic thesis is generally correct, nobody chose to be born anywhere and you're basically compelled to participate in society and be taxed and submit to a system and have no choice about not doing so. As a thought experiment you can't really disregard the reasoning, its pretty much a fact. If you think about how people lived in the past like when they migrated to the new world leaving behind Europe or when people moved westward in the US and how for a long time it was perfectly possible to just up and leave society if you wanted the notion that you can't is a pretty new modern concept.

Its what motivates them to react to this recognition and how they go about it and what political values usually are most important to them that makes them coo coo. In the end I find most people who live in our societies are actually pretty uncomfortable even discussing the philosophical basis for the legitimacy of our institutions and power structures and instead want to just blindly accept them as necessary or factually legitimate without any need for justification beyond whatever things they think matter which is odd considering how our modern world is largely built on revolutionary changes in legitimacy and the establishment of new ideas built on a wholly new philosophical belief system, ie. the enlightenment, nation states, democratic governance, etc. There are whole reams of philosophy to justify the society we live in but to even inquire or examine this seems to make many uncomfortable and that in part exaggerates many of the qualities of the sovereign citizen movement and I see many mock statements made that are actually perfectly reasonable if you made similar observations in a debate on say r/philosophy.

I think while these guys are nuts and little of their personal beliefs are based on anything reasonable all too much the rest of society is too uncomfortable questioning the legitimacy of their systems, or inquiring a to why they're legitimate. When you discuss the police (as is a hot button these days) and say things like ""state monopoly on violence"" you sound like a weirdo making up words, but that's actually a core concept that defines the peace we associate with our society."

"This (or something very similar at-least) happens fairly often. Working in retail, someone is always pissed off about something. I work at Staples and people get so angry about some of the littlest things. Yesterday a woman had driven from a town a little bit away, 30-45 minutes at most. Our local store to her had closed so she had to travel to our location instead. She runs a business in this town and has a contract with Staples, so I know it wasn't just as easy as ""going to another office store"", there's a little more to it. She was very upset that her old store had a ""smaller type of calendar"" than what we had. When I asked her to elaborate some more she couldn't, she didn't have any extra information. Literally all she knew was that she wanted a smaller calendar. We carry literally almost 40' of nothing but planners and different types of calendars. I showed her everything but it definitely wasn't close to what she had in her imagination. She wanted to speak to ""the manager, so they would know what she's talking about"". When I responded that ""I am the manager, I've been at this store for 6 years now and, mam, I'm sorry but I don't have a different type of calendar in the store"" she lost it. Threw her arms up, as if she'd never know what day it was or something. I understand some things, like maybe being out of something your company MUST have to operate, but, a calendar? She got snippy and was about to walk out when I stopped her and offered to maybe look online for a different option ( it's what we're trained to do ) and she just kept on walking. I doubt I'll see her again. If I do I'll try to help her of course. I just hope everyone that has a story like this, whether it's expired coupons or price matching, being out of stock or something rings up wrong, just know that sometimes things go wrong.

I got fired on the end of my first week of my grocery bagging job for showing up drunk and sleeping across 3 chairs in the break room for 6 hours.

At least once a month, or once every five weeks or so, I have a dream in which I can breathe under the water. I always love it, it's always so much fun. And then I wake up, and it turns out to (obviously) not be true. And I ALWAYS manage to be disappointed. Every time.

"This is going to get lost, but it's a decent story anyway. 

My wife worked in meningitis research along with several PhD students. One of the students phoned her professor late one night - ""I'm feeling really unwell, the light really hurts"". He puts the phone down on her.

Ten minutes later, he literally breaks her front door down, grabs her from the bed, carrys her over his shoulder to his car - then drives at breaknet speed, and again carrys her into the emergancy department bellowing that he need the duty consultant NOW. 

Upshot was that she did indeed have meningitis, she spent 10 days in ICU, she came out the other side with no obvious lasting damage.

There was an unexpected plus side to things. Because she was a student in the Meningo research area, she used to have blood taken to act as negative control serum. While she was ill, the lab was monitoring her bloods , and afterwards they had ""pre"" and ""post"" serum from her. This proved invaluable in future vaccine research, and led to several more projects resulting in other student getting their doctorates."

"A guy at work had a crush on me and asked me out. I wasn't really interested, but dating in the city is tough, and a co-worker told me I was being ""too picky!"" and that I should give it a shot. Okay, fine.

The date was a disaster- he picked the restaurant, drank a bunch of beer right away, was being loud and stupid while other people glanced over at us.......the check came and he said, ""This time YOU pay, and next time I'll pay."" Figured it was worth it to just cut my losses and be done with this guy. 

Then I got roses at my desk, and a letter in old-world French talking about how beautiful I was......comments from co-workers in the small office ensued. I called him into the conference room to explain that we weren't dating; that I wasn't interested. 

His response was ""NO..........no.........."" I said ""these are my feelings and you *have to* accept that."" Got a few hang-ups on my voicemail after that, and I started wondering if I should get a gun for protection.

"Repost from other similar thread: 

This one is kind of a recurring problem. Fortunately, as a manager, I only have two people above me: the general manager and the owner.
We have a woman that works for us, is the sweetest woman in the world, but she is a larger woman, older (65), and comes from a farming and military background, so she is strong and stocky.
Unfortunately, she is often mistaken for a transgender person, even though she is not (not that we have a problem with that either).
Anyway, multiple people have refused to do business with her based on her appearance. We do have booking fees at our establishment, and anyone who sets an appointment with her is subject to the cancellation fee if they cancel without notice.
I have had her come out to greet clients, and as soon as they see her, say ""Nope,"" and turn around. (Without getting into detail, our business has NOTHING to do with appearance)
I then charge them a cancellation fee. Often, I get a call a few days later, asking what the charge is. Myself (or my subordinates) say it is for cancelling service without proper notice.
At least 4-5 times I year I get to hear some asshole try to stammer to me why he should get a refund. I always make them say it, as most of the time they try to dance around the issue.
""I had a last minute thing come up."" ""Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that, but your personal life can't affect our business arrangement.""
""She...wasn't what I expected."" ""Oh, in what way?"" ""Uh...you know."" ""No sir, I don't"" ""Well..."" Cue lots of stammering.
Etc. I will NOT give refunds for this, my boss won't and my owner won't. If they REALLY want to push chargebacks against us, they can, but we aren't about to let people do this."

Her friend came back the next week and was feeling a lot better. Then that Friday she went home early because she was feeling sick again. My sister said ""don't die!"" as a joke as kids do. 

Sunday night I walked into my parents sobbing in their room (first time I saw my dad cry). Twenty minutes later, they come out to me and my siblings playing minecraft and say that Courtney died. 

She was 9. 

She had an enlarged heart no one knew about. 

edit because I forgot to include this pointless detail purely for feels: Courtney never received the bow. She didn't get the chance :( so my sister put it in the casket at the funeral

"I miss the early World Wide Web.  It was utter chaos with its newness and the naievity of us all.  There were so many interesting new paradigms and ideas and naked ladies and everything in between.

My dad's first email account allowed him to use a 4 digit PIN as a password.  Can you believe that?! You could literally spoof emails using the menu option of Outlook Express.  People were so trusting of emails and so gullibly fell for phishing attempts to steal their passwords. 

People were building webpages with frames, Flash, ActiveX, and proprietary tags. Does anyone remember writing CGI scripts in Perl? Remember when Internet Explorer was the undisputed king of Web browsers? IE 5.5 was one of the best browsers ever released in its time. 

Then the whole ""Web 2.0"" thing came along, powered by PHP and AJAX requests in JavaScript used to build dynamic and interactive ""Web applications"" focused on conversation and what would soon become social media.  It's hard to believe that all of that was built on a backbone designed to deliver static pages of formatted text to us. Okay, yeah, HTML 5, JavaScript enhancements, HTTP 2.0 and all that jazz but still it's fundamentally the same flawed foundation (especially when you dig down to TCP/IP stack) upon which we've built a massive portal of entertainment, commerce, community, and knowledge (also porn, crime, hatred, etc but at least we have /r/rarepuppers right?)

"It's someone who is under the false belief that all they have to do is get rid of their papers, and therefore they don't need to follow the rules.  

Do you remember Korryn Gaines, who was shot after a standoff with police last year?  the standoff started because she wouldn't comply and go to court.  There was a warrant for her arrest and they had an 8 hour stand off, which almost resulted in her son being killed.  Why was she supposed to go to court?  Because of an incident where she drove without a license plate, since she believed the rules didn't apply to her, which resulted in her being arrested after mouthing off to police and being a bitch.  She recorded the incident herself.

Her son got caught in the crossfire, and when the hospital told family members that they needed to talk to the child alone, they got pissed.  They went to the media and told them ""Dey won't let us talk to him!""    yeah, maybe the hospital staff don't want you manipulating him any further.

*That* is a sovereign citizen.  She believed she could just remove her license plate and not have to follow the rules.  God, I'm *still* pissed at the amount of people who considered her a hero

"That's basically my brother's story. He was head over heels about that girl, who kinda accepted him at first. But she didn't want any kind of commitment, she didn't even want anybody to know about their budding relationship.

Then she broke it out, but wanted to stay friends. We sometimes got out together, it was clear to me he was still hoping she'd change her mind, and she liked the attention and ego-boosting without anything required from her.

But with time, he accepted the idea it would never be more than a friendship. He began to heal and felt better in her company.
And he met someone else. Nothing was official yet, but she must have sensed it because suddenly she was ready to ""give them a second chance"".


He felt SO bad I never saw him like this. Fortunately his new budding relationship gave him the strength, even if he hadn't asked her out yet, to say no.

But boy how he was second-guessing and all. Thankfully he managed to see it was the best answer and the new girl was much more suited to him in every important way.

He took a week of vacation shortly after to clear his head and when he came back, asked the new girl out.

It's still relatively new, but she's already part of the family and it really pleases us to see him happy like that."

It was then that I realized I could fake being busy with ""homework"" and ""projects"" as excuses for them during lunch time. For two weeks I put my lunch in my bag and started eating in the bathroom stalls, hoping no one would knock on the door telling me that I was taking too long using the toilet. "

Oddly, it did get better after graduation. And I say oddly because when you're the weird loser kid who gets savagely bullies from 6th to 12th it really feels like you peaked at 10 or something.

I think that peaking is really objective. A friend of mine has 3 kids. We're 26, her oldest is 10, so she started at 16. By 21, she had her third. Getting knocked up at 16 is a huge burden. She definitely didnt peak in highschool, and didn't peak after, not until recently.

Her life is not easy, but her life is full. As her kids grow, her life gets fuller and richer. She didn't get the chance to go to uni, or have a career, but now we are older and having a family is respectable. Some day, her kids will have grand kids and I know she will be right there with them, peaking again.

My gripe with Hulu is a lot of times shows will only have the latest episodes, or latest season, and not the full series.

Later found out that my mother had left to run errands for the day, expecting a mother to watch the baby. The second Mama left, the woman took off for a friend's house.

"But think of the look on your teacher's face when this happens:

*It was a cold afternoon as pryos1 walked up the crumbling steps to his elementary school. As he wiped the icy rain from his brow, he peered in through one of the windows, to make sure /she/ was there. His eyes found their mark, and it seemed that the dictator that had destroyed all he held dear two decades ago had not aged well. However, while she was withering away, pryos1 had only grown stronger, a bitter resentment only ever-growing in his heart, as it had been since that fateful day. It was true that she held dominion over him once, and that her word was final - absolute, but this was no more. Oh, how the tables had turned, he thought, a grin passing over his face* 


*He pushed open the school doors, still clutching the very same severed Pokemon cards that she had destroyed many years ago. They fluttered gently in the wind, reminding him of how he had treasured them when they were alive. He pushed back his tears as he made his way to her classroom. They were tears of sorrow, tears of resentment, tears of hatred.*


*As he walked up to the door, he heard her voice once more. Though it was weaker than when he had endured under her rule, it was clear that she enacted the same injustices on her students by the sullen looks on their faces. He glanced down at his cards once more, and laid his eyes on his Haunter. How fitting, he thought, remembering how the experience had indeed haunted him. Soon, it would haunt him no more. He gathered up all the strength he could muster, and smote the door so hard it was torn from its hinges.*


*Suddenly, all eyes were on him. The dictator looked too, with a mix of fear, confusion and panic written all over her face. The children did not seem to fear him. He was their liberator, their savior in their time of need.*


*""REMEMBER ME?"" he bellowed. ""I AM PRYOS1, ONE OF THE OPPRESSED SOULS OF THE 5TH GRADE CLASS OF 1997? RECOGNISE THESE?"" He then held up the tattered cards, martyrs that would spark a revolution.*


*""P..pp..pryos...1?"" she stammered, taking a quick glance at the desk where the very same metal weapon of destruction that had torn his children limb from limb lay. It was clear she remembered. ""L..l..ook. I-I'm trying to-to teach. I-I'm sorry t-that you f...eel upset.""*


*However, her manipulative words did not sway him like they did her father those decades ago. He could not stop now. He needed reparations. No - he needed justice. He regained his composure, and stared into her eyes with a firey hatred. ""I demand justice for your actions,"" he said dryly before raising his cards so that they may be seen by the children. ""No...WE demand justice! We will take you to court, where you will receive what you rightfully deserve!"" At once, the children seemed to cheer his name, recognizing /him/ as their leader. However, he could not stay long. Those who may attempt to stop justice - the principal, the janitor, the other staff - could get in his way. With his words still resonating through the room, he sped off, leaving the dictator to drown in her own fear.*


*Shortly afterwards, the fateful day came. He appeared in court. The price he demanded? $19.24. THIS was the cost of their lives. It did not take long, for she gave very little resistance, instead choosing to hand over the money right there in the courtroom. Though she did not seem scared from the outside, he knew that inside she must have been collapsing, her very mind unable to comprehend her fall from power.*


*He had won. It did not that he had spent $450 on legal fees. It did not matter that he had to pay $50 to repay the door he broke. It did not matter that he was now unable to go within 100 yards of the tyrant. All that mattered was that he had brought down the fiery might of justice on the wretched soul.*


*He had used the move Judgement, and it was super effective.*"

...OK then

Of course Ross was worried about the relationship, his paranoia is what caused the strain in the first place. The fact that he slept with Chloe doesn't mean that ""was not upset"". That's what rebound sex is - when you hook up with someone because you're desperately missing the person you just lost.

And he didn't lie because he knew it was wrong. He had every right to do what he did - they were on a break, and he had no reason to believe they'd get back together the next day or any time after that. At that moment what she needed most emotionally was space, so she pushed him away, but that meant he was deprived of the companionship that he needed. He was incredibly vulnerable and right at that moment a girl he barely knew was being kinder to him than Rachel ever had.

He lied out of pragmatism, because why would you tell the truth in that situation? Telling the truth more or less guarantees a horrific breakup. If you lie successfully, the relationship has a chance of rebuilding. And don't tell me relationships built on lies are always doomed. Committed, loving partners lies to each other every day. It was outside the relationship, it wasn't cheating, so why bring it up?

All that said, I don't blame her for being upset and wanting to end it. But she should have been able to acknowledge that it was her own fault for suggesting the break in the first place (what did you think would happen?) instead of milking it for years on end.

As for pride, Ross pales in comparison to Rachel. It's worth remembering that over the course of the series, Rachel deliberately interferes in Ross's relationships and successfully destroys them three times. She made a dramatic entrance at his wedding expressly to stop him from getting married, and while she never actually said what she'd planned, the fact that she got that far shows how little she cares about his feelings. She also persuaded Ross to break up with both Julie and Bonnie in order to be with her, and in both cases immediately found some ridiculous excuse for not following through. Particularly in the second case, they got back together and she took the first opportunity to demand that he take full responsibility for the original breakup and then lectured him endlessly about how much better things were now he'd confessed his guilt.

It seems like Rachel is hardly interested in actually being with Ross. She just doesn't like seeing him with anyone else, so she destroys his relationships to prove that she can have him whenever she wants. Ross is flawed, obviously. But Rachel is the one with the pride issues."

"I've seen this happen. I once let my friend live with me when he was about to become homeless. He came from a pretty poor family. For a while I felt bad for him, but then I witnessed him make several poor choices while he was living with me. He nickled-and-dimed himself with snack food and gas station pop, he refused to see a doctor for any of his health problems (despite having great insurance from the full-time job he had), and spent money on tons of videos games he didn't need. After hearing stories about his parents from his other friends, I came to understand that his poor life habits were inherited from his parents. With a full-time job and a cheap living situation (I tried not to charge him too much to live with me), he had plenty of opportunities to save money and get back on his feet within a few months. But he was constantly running *out* of money and just not taking care of himself.

I understand any sympathy felt towards poor and unfortunate people. They have it rough, and I want to help them. But, like you said, sometimes it's their habits and out-dated beliefs that keep them in a rut. No one really likes hearing that, and I feel kind of bad saying it, especially as a person who's never had to endure poverty. But I know what I've seen, and it made sense."

"I have always been a fan of striaght liquor, and scotch for years now. Still, have to quit because it's hard to just have a small glass of it. Alcohol severely reduces your water retention and makes it a lot more difficult to be athletic. Being overweight is already tough enough, and so I have to give up booze sides for every other weekend at the cottage with family. If you make a rule for yourself to only enjoy it with the right company in the right situation, it's a lot easier to limit intake. I used to pop the bottle any time I had alone time and wasn't doing work for the rest of the night, so video games, watching a movie etc.  I would never drink to get drunk, maybe tipsy, it was for the taste. Even so, ruined me. I went from 180lb to 230 in about 9-12 months. I'm back to 200 now, still working. "

"Ever since I took a psychology course in both high school and in my freshman year of college; I've always been interested in the Human Behavior studies portion of psychology. I would constantly think of what could be studied, if ethics weren't an issue. The one I've always thought was this:

It's similar to The Stanley Milgram Experiment. One person is the teacher and the other is the student. The ""Student"" will be played by two different people; a child and a man. Obviously, both would be actors. One group of people will be given the child to test, and another will get the man. From here, it'll be the same as the Milgram Experiment. I also came up with various variations to test different things:

Variation 1: Both groups don't see their ""student"" and just ask the questions, and shock them.

Variation 2: The ""Teachers"" do meet their ""student,"" even spend a little time with them before they begin the test. Test to see how people would react to shocking someone they had spend some time with?

Variation 3: Both groups don't meet the ""student"" beforehand, but as they administer the test, they have an audio &amp; video link to the ""student."" They will see and hear the person going through the pain. Wondered if they would be willingly to continue if they can not only hear, but see the pain. The same would be for the child ""student;"" again, they would be actors, so there wouldn't be any real pain.

Variation 4: For the group that would be administering the test to the male ""student,"" they would be told beforehand that the man is a convicted criminal (rapist, pedophile, etc.). This would test whether people would or wouldn't show sympathy to someone they were told was a criminal? 

Variation 5: Same as Variation 4, but at the end, it would be ""discovered"" that the man that was believed to be a criminal was actually a normal person. They wouldn't have any audio &amp; visual links to the ""student"" while the test was being administered.

Variation 6: Same as Variation 5, but it would be discovered that it was actually the child they were testing on, and not the criminal.

I could go on, but I think I'll stop it here. Again, this was something I've always thought about. Always curious how people would react to various situations. I know this was very disturbing post, but I'm sure the same can be said about the Milgram and Stanford Prison Experiments. Yet, it's because of those, we can better understand the human psyche and behavior."

"Never excel. If you show competence in a job above and beyond what is needed you will very rarely be rewarded for it, and will often receive an ever growing work load. Eventually you will be out in a situation where you will fail, and then there will be consequences. Shoot for the middle of the road - be dependable but completely forgettable.

The second thing I learned was the toxic leadership philosophy of 'fix it until it is broken.' Take an activity, mission or process that has worked flawlessly in the past, and begin making changes - each worse than the last. Eventually the program will fail and you will then get to replace it with your own weaker idea and claim on your quarterly report that you 'fixed a broken program'. I went from a fucking incredible unit to a piece of shit in three months because leadership did this. "

Then I learned what winning 5 grand at the casino was like, then I learned what my father being in jail was like, then my aunt dying from cancer, then what getting sober was like, then what my best friend falling off a cliff was like, etc, etc you get the idea.

There are crests and troughs on the waves, but to pinpoint an overall ""peak"" is difficult. SO, I can't say if I peaked or not"

When I was about 12 I was making ramen and was standing in front of the stove waiting for the water to boil. I had opened the Ramen pack and removed the flavor pack and the noodles were beside me on the counter in the pack. 


I zoned out. 


Finally I zone back in and the water is boiling. I go to put in the noodles and.... They're gone. Just vanished. I look in the garbage, everywhere, I didn't remember even moving, I'd just been staring at the stove. Flavor pack was still there but the rest was nowhere. 


Weeks later I was cleaning the oven and removed the burners and lifted the hood of the stove, and there was my noodles. Open packet with noodles but no flavor pack. Directly under the burner I'd been using. I don't know how I'd have managed it with the burner plugged in and on high and a pot of water on top. I don't remember doing it.

"America started a war of aggression against the Canadian colonies, and ended the war with little to show but dead soldiers. Impressment ended because ex-British deserters (who were the vast majority of the impressed) stop deserting from the Napoleonic wars, because the Napoleonic wars had stopped; that was always going to happen. Likewise, trade restrictions were placed on the US because they were funding Napoleon - that stopped being a problem when Napoleon was toppled. The forts only existed because of the threat of American aggression to the north, which after taking so many casualties in the war of 1812 forced them to promise to the British not to try again. How can you have won a war when the other side didn't want to be at war in the first place and you achieved none of your war objectives? Meanwhile, the British objective was not to lose the Canadian land - which they didn't. It still amazes me that it's seen with any pride in the US when they were forced to near white peace on a war they started, where the other side was unprepared and involved in (at the time) the biggest war the world had ever seen - by any sane measure, it was a categorical failure."

There there was one braggart that stood out to me to this day. He was 25 years old, $70,000 in his savings account, had been maxing out his IRA for the last three years, had $25,000 in a Vanguard account, and like another $50,000 in an emergency savings account. The entire post was summed up as ""am I doing ok?"". 

There was another 16 year old humble bragging about how he already has $10,000 saved up and he was wondering if there was more he should be doing. No, you stupid prick. We get it, you're young and have a sizable savings account. Congratulations. Yes, we all want to hear about how you want to be an engineer and are going to subject yourself to eating lentils until you're 45 years old and have a million dollars in your bank account by then.

I was never so far gone that I called for ""safe spaces"" (i.e. places where no one disagrees) though, &amp; I was persuaded away from the ideology gradually. A tipping point was seeing Chris Hayes on MSNBC call it racist to say Islam was bad. Also on MSNBC I saw a black lady defending another black lady's decision to flee a traffic stop... instances like those made it clear what was happening to the Left: they were valuing social equality more than truth. Today, Leftist identity politics &amp; politically-correct science-denial is a toxic threat to morally progressive discourse &amp; classical liberalism (see Europe) which inadvertently empowers the Alt Right &amp; fascists (as David Frum put it, ""When liberals insist that only fascists will defend borders, then voters will hire fascists to do the job liberals won’t do."")"

"This guy who attempted to kill Louis XV of France, [Robert-François Damiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert-Fran%C3%A7ois_Damiens). 

&gt;Fetched from his prison cell on the morning of 28 March 1757, Damiens allegedly said ""La journée sera rude"" (""The day will be hard""). He was first subjected to a torture in which his legs were painfully compressed by devices called ""boots"". He was then tortured with red-hot pincers; the hand with which he had held the knife during the attempted assassination was burned using sulphur; molten wax, molten lead, and boiling oil were poured into his wounds. He was then remanded to the royal executioner, Charles Henri Sanson, who harnessed horses to his arms and legs to be dismembered. But Damiens' limbs did not separate easily: the officiants ordered Sanson to cut Damiens' tendons, and once that was done the horses were able to perform the dismemberment. Once Damiens was dismembered, to the applause of the crowd, his reportedly still-living torso was burnt at the stake.

Yup. That day was hard.

However, I think I'd prefer that over [this](http://i.imgur.com/cxEkp1O.jpg) (sfw) poor guy, who gut stuck in a tight passage deep underground. Absolutely terrifying.

Of course one kid insisted that it was funny every single time and it was so hard to watch, but I had to let him keep doing it until the other kids put him in check and he realized he looked like an idiot. 

Also, I had a 6th grader who had an extreme crush on an 8th grader. At the end of the year he gifted her    massage oils with a creepy note and she reported it to the administration. Then on the last day of school he tried to steal the class picture I had with her in it and a student caught him. I tried to diffuse the situation but the kids figured it out, he didn't hide his obsession very well. He was in my homeroom this past year and I always made sure my picture was there before I left for the day. He also asked me if he could have an assignment of hers I kept as an example for a project. One day he asked me how much a plane ticket cost to China (she was an international student and went back there for high school) and I told him it would be a little strange for him to visit someone halfway around the world who did not feel the same way and wasn't expecting him...he told me I was being disrespectful.

"When someone insists that I am mad when I am not. Also, telling me to 'calm down' or 'relax'.

"Yeah, I've seen that so much. You regret even asking them. Sometimes I like to ask people not because I don't know, but because maybe I want their opinion, and I know how people like to be consulted if they have lots of experience. Plus you can get lots of history that way. It's generally been a very successful tool for me over the years.

But then there are people who see it as ignorance they can expose. When they blow it out of proportion and try to make me look dumb, then I'll just never ask that person again and I'll keep them away from my stuff. Makes me regret even talking to them.

Had it happen last week. ""Hey middle aged lady who used to do my area. Did you ever experience this? ""

Her (loudly): ""What do you mean? You talking mumbo jumbo or mumbo jombo(deliberately phrasing it in a way no one else does, and mis-characterizing my question)? Just go pull up your sheet and let me look""

At this point I'm regretting even extending my question. But she's so full of bluster I just go with it.

Finally pull up my shit, and it's exactly as I explained ""Oh well, I don't know, it's not like when I used to do it"" then starts making a big show and acting like I don't know what I'm doing. Asking questions on my behalf

"My most recent one. 

I'm not a prude by any means, I like some kinky stuff in the bedroom. But this girl just put me to shame. Let me do everything I've ever wanted to, and then she started pushing the limits of what I was comfortable with. I even had to draw a line. I wasn't ready to be pegged by a complete stranger.

Anyway lots of freaky sex was had, and I thought it smelled pretty bad, worse than usual, but it was also my first time with a girl who wanted to shove her tongue up my butthole so I shrugged it off... until I turned on the lights. There was SHIT, EVERYWHERE. The bed, the walls, the floor. I don't even know how it happened. Worse still, there was shit all over both of us too. 

She was mortified. I suggested we take a shower and I could do some laundry. We threw everything in the laundry machine, and she said she would join me in the shower in a minute. I get in the shower and wait for her... and wait. After maybe 5-10 minutes I get out and look around.

She's gone. She tried scrubbing the shit off my walls (and took off some of the paint) and just dumped hot water on the shit stains on the carpet. Then she left. All while I was in the shower.

I ended up having to rent a carpet cleaner, and repaint my bedroom. 

She also unmatched me on Tinder, so... never heard from her again."

Polygamy is still a doctrine of the LDS church. They just don't like talking about it, and don't practice it at the moment due to the legal ramifications of doing so.

Any Mormon man who remarries after his first wife dies, knows that he will be sealed to both wives in the afterlife. Many Mormons speculate that marriages of multiple women to the same man could continue in the Millenium, or in the Celestial Kingdom, and they have a sound doctrinal basis for believing so. "

In it I see what appears to be a newborn. As I begin to ask him when he got a new sibling, he picks up a nearby plastic mallet and bashes the baby in the head with it. After a understandable wtf moment from me he explains that it is simply a very realistic looking baby doll and his mom's just into that kind of stuff. Later that day she took it out in a stroller. This was in Indiana.

"Not exactly a case of missing person, but when I was around 16, my childhood friend invited me to what he said was a birthday party. Me being the shy introverted guy I was (and partly still am) I refused. 

The next day, his mother (my mother's best friend) came home crying and I was sent upstairs so they could speak. Later that day I was told that the ""birthday guy"" was not only not really having his birthday, but was also found dead in that place, with a cracked skull and broken legs.

Three suspects were taken that day, two guys I knew and my friend. At first it was thought to be an accident, but the autopsy (which couldn't be done again because it was later tampered with) revealed cracks more relevant to a heavy pipe hitting the head and ribs, with the legs broken from a fall.

To top it off, the whole place was scraped clean of alcohol that same night (one of the guys had a friend in the police apparently), and since the guys were underaged, they couldn't even be taken to custody.

To this day they're still around. My mother still thinks they didn't do anything, but everyone who was there knew, the autopsy pretty much confirmed that. I haven't talked to my ""childhood friend"" since that happened."
"As someone who had someone fall out of love with me, I beg people to be careful with the heart of another if they dont deserve to have it broken. Even if you no longer want to be with someone, tell them the truth, be kind, answer their questions, and just remember the pain you are going to cause if you leave someone who loves you with all their heart. Remember that love isnt always a happy feeling. The butterflies come and go, but true love is a choice you make everyday, choosing to love someone in spite of their flaws, or the ever changing conditions of life. This pain I feel I would not wish on my worst enemy, and I think the only reason I feel it so intensely is because she never told me why. She just started a new life one day and decided I wasn't going to be part of it. Thats enough to destroy a person. "

While coming down from the roof an old man with medals pinned on his chest looked at me with tears in his eyes, grabbed my arm, and said in a shaky voice ""I was here 50 years ago"". I was lost for words... I stuttered ""Thank you for saving us"", he just nodded and continued his climb. I can still hear his voice in my head, the shakiness and brittleness of it, I think I will never forget it.

Transportation - public transit or a bike if possible; a car if you absolutely need it, but you never NEED a new or nice car. That is a want.

Clothing - beyond the basics, most clothes people buy are not out of need.

Electronics - a basic flip phone is all anyone needs. Smart phones and data plans are not. Same goes with TVs, cable, nice laptops, tablets, or other toys.

Eating out - almost always a want. Same goes for buying high-quality cuts of meat, nice cheese, junk food, and most processed foods.

Alcohol/weed - always a want.

"My school (K-8th grade) started a uniform when I was in 3rd or 4th grade. Typical uniform of khaki or navy bottom: pants for boys, pants or skirts for girls and a choice of a few colors of plain polo shirts (no logos). We had gym class 3x each week and were not given any gym uniform or allowed to change out of non-uniform clothing. So the boys would have to be running around in stiff khaki trousers, and the girls would have to stay in their skirts. Most girls chose skirts even though trousers were allowed, but since we weren't allowed to change, we would all wear cotton shorts [like this](https://dtpmhvbsmffsz.cloudfront.net/posts/2016/03/29/56fb5d297f0a056126031295/m_5705bacc4e8d177940012889.jpg) under our skirts every day. It was so stupid they wouldn't even give us five minutes to change. It meant the girls would have to wear a whole extra layer of clothing all day and have to run and play sports in their regular bra instead of a sports bra (pretty annoying for the 7th and 8th grade girls who were mostly developed at that point). Plus I'm sure our parents weren't thrilled with us having the expensive uniforms come home ripped or dirty from wearing them as athletic clothing.

The only time we were allowed to change was once per year for the Presidential Physical Fitness Test where we had to run a timed mile. We could change for the mile and that was it."

- [The dinosaurs have a few ideas about astronomy effecting our lives on Earth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event) Or *would*...

These are just things I know of off the top of my head.  But on a more important note, astronomy is an interesting field because it has an incalculable effect on so many lives because it's the gateway drug to science.  I have lost count of how many people I know personally who wanted to be an astronaut or an astronomer as a kid and then went off to become a scientist or engineer- it's definitely a thing, but not an easy one to measure.  Think of it this way, astronomy is the only science where if you go to the newsstand we have our own magazines just for the field- multiple, even! (Well, unless you think stuff like *Cat Fancy* counts for biology.) People are definitely interested in a casual way that isn't like other sciences!

Honestly, when people ask me about the public use of my personal research, I'm pretty upfront that while there are side benefits, that's not why we do it.  I do it because I am in love with the story of the universe and everything in it, and want to know some of that story and share it with others.  And a fundamental part of humanity is the drive to learn more and find answers to fundamental questions... even if they don't have immediate effect on our lives."

"Senior year of high school we had a substitute teacher for one class as the regular teacher had a serious health issue. When she started, as often happens, she was treated with a great deal of disrespect and did a pretty good job of getting past it and trying to do her best, and was also a 9.5/10 and 25 years old, and I had a great deal of respect for her ability to teach under those circumstances.

Early on (first few days?) I approached her and apologized for the class being so terrible and offered any help that she might need in terms of controlling the class as well as the work (it was my favourite subject at the time). She appreciated my effort and kindness, and we hit it off very well due to our mutual interest in the academic subject as well as my unusual maturity at that time.

Over the next month or so we started seeing each other more and more around school, and the mutual attraction was very clear to both of us. We found time to be together at school more and more during our free time, and even took it a step further by spending time together outside of school hours as well as off campus. We'd play frisbee, walk around parks, see movies, and one day it happened. My parents actually knew about it but never told me to stop, for which I had great respect for them (plus I had a good relationship with them and they knew I was a mature and responsible person).

I wasn't a virgin and knew what I was doing and what I wanted. So did she. We spent most of my senior year practically inseparable, and while people in school were talking about us, we tried our best to not make it too obviously, though all my friends knew we were hooking up. The school never tried to intervene, due to ignorance or willful ignorance I do not know, but nevertheless it was a spectacular year for me, and I always did well academically so there was no reason for anyone to call me out. Plus she was absolutely gorgeous and a freak in the sack, so I didn't want to ruin a good thing. We both understood that she could get in trouble, but we figured that as long as we didn't make it too obvious it could happen.

It ended up playing itself out by the end of the year as I was going off to uni and kind of know that, while I was in fact mature for my age, the next 4 years were going to be very different and the relationship likely could not continue and the summer was kind of sad, but I knew that we needed to end it. She understood too, though we were both sad about it, and when I went off to uni we kept in touch for a while still, but we both moved on.

I never felt taken advantage of, and was more than happy to have that relationship. Nothing bad happened, so I don't have anything to post to /r/Whatcouldgowrong or another sub, and I reflect back on those days with happiness. I kind of wish we'd stayed in touch longer as I'm curious to know what she's up to now and how she is doing, but I'm not going to try. But as she was 25 and I was 17, I really appreciated her maturity relative to high school women who seemed like kids to me at the time, and she was very different, and it was great. I think it was good for me that it happened, and I'm happy she never got in trouble for it as she was a good person and wasn't trying to take advantage of me, I honestly believe that.

I know it's not a crazy story full of ups and downs and intrigue, but I'm happy to answer any questions."

"Alright I'll try again:

* Download Tor Browser
* Start Tor
* Find adress to the site you intend to buy from on the regular internet. For me that would be flugsvamp, a Swedish vendor. So I'd google ""flugsvamp adress"" and find this: http://flugsvamp72rajmk.onion
* Enter above mentioned adress in Tor
* Register your account, just like any account on any site really. Just make sure it's something incoherent and not linked to your other usernames 

* Register account on let say, localbitcoins. Easy process. 

Buying is a little bit more difficult on localbitcoins because the transactions can be spooky because you're sending your own money first. As a Swede I can use Swish, which is an app similar to paypal, but the banks actually approve it. Check if your country has similar payment methods, or just use paypal.

* If you've bought bitcoins from a user with good reputation, the seller will release the bitcoins as soon as he gets your payment (they generally sit in escrow).

* So now you've got bitcoins on your localbitcoins account. The next step would be to tumble; Tumbling is basically laundering. Bitcoins, just as regular money, have serial numbers. Through tumbling, you'd be switching bills basically. Put in a bitcoin with the serial number 999 in the tumbler, and get a new one with the serial code 565. This is in order for your transaction not to be traced by anyone. Though, tumbling is not a must, but it's prefered. 

Note though: In order to tumble, you must register an account on any website that tumbles bitcoins. When I do this, I always make up a new spoof email to register

* If you've chosen to tumble your bitcoins, they'll be sitting on the site that you've tumbled them on. When they arrive and are available (tumbling may take up to a few hours, but generally only takes a few minutes), you hop onto the website you're buying from (e.g. flugsvamp) and find the address you will be sending your bitcoins to (generally just called a wallet). These addresses look something like this: 1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2

* So then you log into the tumbling website, go to transactions, find ""send bitcoins"", paste the above mentioned adress into the address field and hit send. Your bitcoins will then arrive at flugsvamp in a few minutes, but this might take up to a few hours as well. 

* Alright cool, now we've got our bitcoins on the site we intend to buy from. This is just as any online shopping, so you just find what you want, and press buy. 

* Now it's time for PGP. This is just a program, available to download for free on the regular internet. Download it and start. 

* After you've pressed ""buy"", [this](https://www.flugwiki.se/filer/Handla8.gif) will probably pop up. The highlighted text is the PGP key the seller uses, which you also will use to encrypt your name and adress. Simply click on ""Import keys"" in the PGP-program and press ""From clipboard"" and the seller will pop up to the [right](https://www.flugwiki.se/filer/Handla10.gif)

* Next step is to write down your adress, and name. Then hit ""Encrypt"" and a bunch of [gibberish](https://www.flugwiki.se/filer/Handla11.gif) will pop up. Copy that gibberish, and paste into the order. 

Hope this was easier. "

I do know that of my several exes, there is only one that I wouldn't check to make sure they're okay. *This* one is the only one I would probably be deeply concerned about because texting ""I still love you"" out of the blue would be out of character. 

One of them I would just message his current girlfriend on facebook and tell her to check on him, because it's not really out of character for him to send me stupid texts *ten years* after we broke up when he's out drinking with the boys. 

One of them can rot in a grave in hell for all I care. If he called and said he was in a ditch on the side of the road, on fire and burning to death, I would ask which ditch so I could grab popcorn and come watch. But he was a horrible human being regardless of dating me; I just got to see his truly despicable side. "

"Here's my theory. There have been definite, verifiable discoveries of out of place materials and rock work on the island. The huge amount of coconut fiber, the artificial swamp, parts identified as coming from a ship, including pieces of an anchor. I think that the swamp area was a makeshift drydock used to attempt repair of one of the two missing ships from the 1715 spanish treasure fleet, but not one that was carrying what we would consider treasure. One of the two, possibly the San Martin or the el ciervo was supposedly carrying a cargo consisting of tobacco, Brazilian hardwood logs for violin making, and pottery likely packed in cocoanut husks. The hardwood logs may have matched the size of the ones found in the platforms of oak island. The tobacco was worth it's weight in gold at the time , but would have been worthless if flooded by sea water. 

I believe one of the two ships was damaged by the hurricane, but pushed way north where it beached on oak island, possibly damaging the bow. The crew decided to attempt a repair, lightening the ship of all nonessential equipment, the cargo, and then decided to dig a very large hole putting the heavy ship bits like anchors, maybe cannons and shot, chains, decorative brass lanterns from the stern, etc. Into the hole.  Then they used the hardwood cargo, extra spares from the ship etc. To build platforms for the tobacco. The China was presumably destroyed in the beaching, so they used the coconut fiber to rig a booby trap to flood and destroy the tobacco so none of the French or British colony or military forces in the area could retrieve it, fixed the ship possibly by shortening it and fitting a new bow post (accounting for the one later reportedly found in the swamp) and then attempted to sail home where along the way the ship sank. 

The tobacco would have deteriorated into muck by now, and the wood pieces after that long underground may have turned odd colors. 

I suspect the oak island excavation will eventually find more metal plates and old bolts, other metal bits, maybe some cannons, but there isn't a pile of gold or silver there. Maybe a small bit of treasure was buried separately and later found. The discovery of those metal brackets without the bolts in them, but matching tightened period correct bolts found nearby says to me a bracket that was kept as valuable ship hardware at the time, but wasnt activly installed in anything. The oak tree with the wear marks was due to lowering those bits. The flood tunnel was designed to ruin the tobacco. The platforms were just to keep the bales separated to reduce the chance of spoilage until a return voyage that never arrived could retrieve them. If my theory is right, there should be a large pile of broken pottery somewhere near the island. 

The swamp came about first as a makeshift drydock, and then was blocked to flood and hide signs that a ship was worked on at that spot so that no one would investigate it. 

That's what I think is there anyways"

"1. This is hard to explain but my wife has an innate ability to sense when I'm already leaving a room/have sat down/have gotten comfortable and then asking me for a favor to be completed across the house. 

Example. I am in the bedroom, wife is also in bedroom doing her make up or just on her phone, I walk downstairs (she sees me leave the room) to get a glass of water and come back to the bedroom at which point she will instantaneously remember that she needs her purse Bc her little make up pouch is in there so I have to go all the way back down and back up. I should really start asking if she needs anything....

2. My wife also likes to ask me to fix up some quick food (like instant ramen) BUT she asks me to make it, sees that I have started and then goes outside to smoke, goes upstairs to the bathroom and spends 30mins-1hour justcin the bathroom, showers, gets dressed, tidies up a bit, THEN comes down to eat. The food is cold. I've learned to time it so I don't start anything until I hear the shower turn off but man this use to drive me crazy. 

I usually just keep quiet though since it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. But man sometimes it's like, ""really?""

"&gt; wasn't the narrators initiating issue that his life was little more then nesting; generally considered a feminine behavior? 

Exactly. The narrator is unable/unwilling to live up to a rigid set of standards which society is telling him he must meet to be a man, and the cognitive dissonance this is causing him is making him miserable, unable to find satisfaction or any sense of accomplishment, or to form healthy relationships. This is the literal definition of toxic masculinity.

Then as a coping mechanism, his mind invents Tyler Durden- the absolute avatar of what he considers to be all things man, who becomes his mentor on a journey of learning how to be self sufficient, confident, decisive, aloof, rebellious, physically dominant and independent of the approval of others- all the things he that men are supposed to be.

Then the curtain comes down, and he sees that all of this is self destructive bullshit."
"That's only half the message, the men at the beginning of the movie feel castrated by society; that's why Durden's message appeals to them. "

"My 89 year old grandfather recently found out his birthday was wrong by one day.

He went to a navy training school starting in the 30's then immediately joined the navy afterwards. At some point in his early schooling his DOB had been put down on some paperwork wrong and had been continued to be copied incorrectly since then. He never looked at his birth certificate properly till recently he had to get another one (the original is long long gone) and was informed of the original date. He even managed to emigrate with his given DOB and his actual DOB being off.

So maybe your SovCit in training had a point. A very bad point sure, but a point none the less. "

"I have two scars on my hand, from the two points of a pair of scissors. Which I stabbed myself with trying to cut a hole in the plastic cap of a 2 litre soda bottle, to make a water gun. I stabbed pretty deep, and my older brother (who is pretty squeamish about blood and not so great in an emergency) flipped out, couldn't find any bandages, and didn't know what to do. So like the hero he is, he wadded up some toilet paper, wrapped it with electrical tape, and told me to hide it from our parents when they got home. 


Which is fine, except I was like 5 and he was 16 or 17. My hand was mumified with black electrical tape. How did he reasonably expect they wouldn't notice? 


They noticed and did not care. I was an idiot. It definitely wasn't his fault. "

The media shows women who look like myself as attractive, but not other types of Black women enough. My good friend is brown skinned &amp; mentions this too.

I think some do the same with walls.)"

"I do it because the range of people I socialise with all have different requirements and triggers that set them off on a tangent I can't be assed with.

An example would be how someone asks you to do something, you do it, they get annoyed you did it a weird way so you do it their way. Next day someone else asks you to do the same thing, so you preemptively do it the second way only for them to get annoyed you didnt do it the way you did it first time the other day.

So you just ask how they want it, then they get annoyed you asked because it ""should be obvious"" when it really isnt because people are different.

So in the case of asking about the cup, you probably gave someone a glass one time, that person said ""no, not that one, the other one"" and you had to go get the plastic cup despite it seemingly being irrelevant, so next time you ask to save the effort.

"Dinner together *every single night*, including weekends. 

A lot of my friends growing up had dinner with their whole family maybe once or twice a week. Otherwise it was grab what you can when you can. My family required that we sit down for a meal every single night of the week. If I was at someone's house for the weekend, I had to remind my parents that I would be gone *and* I would be missing dinner, because apparently the two did not go hand in hand.

I would love to say it made our family closer, but I honestly think we were a little too exposed to each other. Family dinners do nothing if it's spent in tense silence because no one wants to start a fight. "

"GMO is a very broad term. We have been modifying genetics through selective breeding for thousands of years, thus creating ""Genetically Modified Organisms"".
  
However, what you're referring to also falls under the definition of modifying organisms genetically, but it's with newer methods like gene splicing, and with inter-species genetics.
  
So you're both right. Selective breeding and gene splicing are both methods to modify the genetics of an organism. This was the problem with labeling foods ""GMO"", because the definition needs to be more concise. One method we've been doing for thousands of years, and the other is relatively new."

And He said, ""I'll come back tomorrow and make it just as pretty as the rest of the world,with lakes and streams and mountains and trees."" And He got back the next day, and saw that the ground had completely hardened, like concrete. And He didn't want to begin all over again. No! In His infinite wisdom, He had an idea. He said: ""I know what I'll do. I'll make some people that like it this way!"

"Probably called you a ""libtard""or a few other things under his breath as well. Our society is so segmented now that it makes my teeth hurt.

Calling you ""entitled""? Fuck yeah. Be entitled! My generation got beat up pretty well by the Great Recession. A lot of us went from doing well to being lucky to still have a job. We learned to do without and to do more work for less pay. We learned that our benefits were going the way of the dodo. We toughened up and learned not to complain. We learned not to expect much.

Therein lies the problem. The economy improved, but our situations stayed the same. Our employers learned that we were willing to take a lot of shit in order to keep our jobs. We were, and still are, cowed. 

Don't be like that. Be entitled as fuck. Ask for what you want, because the people in charge aren't  gonna give it to you otherwise.

"Bear with me as I condense alot.. 
 My father helped me escape an abusive narcissist that didn't really show her colors until I'd moved to another state and was about to marry her. I got trapped financially and emotionally. Before long she started to physically get after me, the one thing that haunts me to this day is this hysterical laugh she did after nearly breaking my back and then calling me names as I was crying from the pain and reeling on the floor. I had done something to upset her and this was her response. Her and her family hated Veterans (didn't know until the end). She spent almost 2 years lying and cheating while forcing me to go to counseling at this ""religious"" center for everything she was gas-lighting me on. I became miserable to the point of seriously contemplating suicide to escape. I was more afraid of my family finding out what I had gotten myself into, so as any great logical thinker would do, I threw myself farther in, hoping it would get better and still feeling trapped, but looking back I was mostly terrified of what would happen if I tried to leave. Her family constantly brought up their relation to the Italian mob, not sure if it was directed at me or not but it made it even more stressful because I feared for my family as well and I decided if my family was in harm I'd take the brunt if the claims turned out to be real. Obviously there were things we both did that were awful because of the *totally* amazing relationship we had but I'd like to believe I didn't deserve these things. Looking back it was a fucking nightmare and something I still cant wrap my head around that actually happened but it was a definable learning experience for sure.  "

Needless to say the nurses had a good laugh about it all.

"&gt;1984 

Had my mind blown reading this as an adult.  In high school, the only theme we ever discussed was the idea of surveillance (which has led to generations of people screaming ""OMG BIG BROTHER!!1!"" without knowing what that actually *means*).

I admittedly read this in high school before 2001, so the themes on war weren't as relevant, but this book became un-put-down-able once I got to *The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism*, which spells out the economic and social justifications of modern warfare.

"FWIW, I actually had this happen!

A piece of sheet metal, square, maybe 2ft x 2ft, maybe a little smaller, was on the road ahead. I didn't see it until the wheel of a truck in the next lane kicked it up and it went airborne. I got to see it head up into the air and come down edgewise towards my car. There were lanes of traffic on each side of me and cars behind, so I had nowhere to go, and in any case it happened too quickly, so all I could really do was brace for impact.

*Zing! Thump! Skitter!* It hit. Thankfully it hit edgewise on the front of the car, not the windshield, slicing into the area at the front where the foglamps are.  Debris from the damage skittered over the windshield and over the car, but the plate went under and didn't damage anything else as we drove over it.

We took the next exit and checked the damage. Slice across the plastic trim at the front of the car, fog light and turn signal taken out. But nothing structural or mechanical damaged. We drove home.

I was kinda okay that day, pretty startled by the experience, but the next day I was a wreck.

(What I don't know is what happened after that to other traffic on the road.)

"Your information is incorrect. 

Specifically your statement that a single nuclear detonation of a US warhead would destroy a third of North Korea. 

The highest yield thermonuclear weapon in the US inventory is the B83, at 1.2 megatons. This is an incredibly powerful device, at 60 times the yield of the Hiroshima bomb. However, it would not even come close to destroying a third of North Korea. 

North Korea is 46,511 square miles. Using nukemap (google it) you can simulate the destructive potential of a 1200kt air burst over Pyongyang. It's huge, but thermal radiation damage extends over 225 square miles. That's enormous for a single blast, but not anywhere remotely near a third of the country. It would, however, utterly annihilate Pyongyang. 

Even if you simulated the largest nuclear detonation ever, the Tsar Bomba at 50 MT you only have a radius of 4380 square miles, just under 10%, and a lot of that is ocean so it doesn't really count. 

Nukes are totally fucking terrifying, but I'd suggest educating yourself on the real scope of their destructive power. 

Also, 200 detonations wouldn't end all life. There's been more than 200 detonations from testing already. Now, if there were 200 super high yield detonations all at the same time with a deployment profile that maximized fallout then sure I'll allow that some serious nuclear winter effects are possible. In fact the nuclear winter theory hypothesizes that 100 huge firestorms started by nuclear detonations would be sufficient to cause this. It all depends where those detonations occur. Detonations in the desert probably wouldn't cause fire storms. Cities probably would. "

"Well im not really a local since Im from Czech but I've lived here long enough to recognize someone else who lives here from a tourist (6 years). It's very different to be honest. People here go to malls a lot since they are quite big and apart from JBR or city walk it's the only place where you would really go out. Tourists usually go around shopping a lot because even though Dubai is very expensive there are always some sales around. Locals only go there to hang out and get something to eat. Living in Dubai overall is pretty expensive but very good. I would say it's on the same level as living in London or New York when it comes to life quality apart of having something to do. In Dubai you pretty much do the same thing over and over again. Quality of food is amazing though, people are nice, and there's very little crime. A lot of people ask me about local arabs originally from Dubai because they are all wealthy and you would think arrogant. I know quite a lot of them and they are all very nice people. Me and my friends still make jokes about them deporting you if you offend them but they just laugh with us. Dubai is nice in the tourist zones, everything else is just a desert with bunch of building here and there.

"My father used to tell me that I had an excellent ""reading vocabulary.""

That was his way of saying, ""Max, you mispronounce things a lot.""

Mispronounced words in my repertoire (ree-per-TOY-ray) included:

Obelisk (OBE-lisk)    
Chagrin (CHAIR-in)    
Golem (Gah-LEEM)    
Myth (Meeth)    
Blithe (Bleeth)    

... and a whole host of others that I can't be bothered to remember right now.

Still, even those mistakes were nothing compared to my younger brother's best mispronunciation... which requires a little bit of backstory.

My family used to go skiing every other weekend when I was younger, and quite frequently, the only entertainment we'd have while staying at our condo was a stack of ""Fox Trot"" comic anthologies. Although I wasn't an especially avid fan of the strip (though I did feel a certain sympathy for Jason), the books were still more entertaining than staring at the wall for hours on end. More memorable even than those, though, were the three specific meals that my mother would insist on cooking every time the family was away from home. My least-favorite of these dishes, at least from what I can recall, consisted primarily of undercooked potato chunks swimming in some kind of watery sour cream sauce.

It was not appetizing.

Anyway, after spending an evening reading the comics that I mentioned, my brother learned a new expression... and he decided to use it as a commentary on our dinner that night. The moment we all sat down, he stared at his plate and yelled:

""*Bleach!*""

Everyone turned to look at him. ""What?"" my father asked.

""Bleach!"" repeated my brother. ""Bleach!""

""Clorox,"" I answered. ""What are you talking about?""

""No, not *bleach*,"" my brother said. ""*Bleach!* Like they say in 'Fox Trot.'""

We all sat in silence for a moment. Finally, something seemed to occur to my father. ""Do you mean '*blech?*'"" he asked.

""Oh. Yes."" My brother eyed his plate again. ""Blech!""

We all had a laugh about that, after which my father told my brother that he was being rude, and to shut up and eat his dinner.

**TL;DR:** ***Bleach!***"

"It's very important, but most people don't understand what it means to meditate.  

Things you DON'T need to do:  
Sit on a mat with your legs crossed.  
Hold your hands in a weird pose.  
Waste hours of your day sitting motionless and thinking of nothing.  
Repeat ""ohmmmm"" like you are worshiping the god of transistors.  

Things you DO need to do:  
Be alone in a quiet place with no external stimulus.  
Allow your thoughts to flow freely, let your mind process as it needs.  
Breathe.  
Do not look at clocks, check messages, or be on the lookout for anything - this is stressful.  

Meditation is basically just putting yourself in an environment where you have no responsibilities, no immediate concerns, and nothing to do except reflect. While you are meditating you are mentally and emotionally safe from *yourself*, and you give yourself the time to feel that relief and think objectively about whatever is on your mind.  

The correct amount of time to spend meditating is however long it takes for you to feel peace and clarity. Then meditate for a little while longer until you feel a little bored and restless. You should feel eager to go back to your routine and tackle life."

"Hey, I'm one of the 'I don't like the taste of alcohol' people.

It's simple really. I tried beer, wine, whisky, vodka... most things.

Yes, they all taste different, very different but they all have this thing in common. A common sort of bitterness that make your face twitch (I think the word is grimace, not a native speaker), like you just licked lemon... Do you understand what I'm talking about? If you drink something blindly, you can tell if it is an alcoholic beverage or not yes? Even if it is a completely new drink that you never tasted - yet with alcohol in it. I'm talking about ""that"" taste. I can't stand that taste. Mind you, I'm a middle aged guy and worked in music industry. Alcohol everywhere. It's not that I'm not exposed to it.

I love the smell oddly, and I love every other taste that is in alcoholic drinks, I just can't stand that common alcoholic taste that is common in all alcoholic beverages. I would have loved to enjoy red wine for instance - the smell alone intoxicates me and feels very very appealing, but I just can't get over that bitter alcoholic taste that makes me grimace. Trust me I tried, and I try every so often when the wife opens a bottle. I can't drink more than two sips.

Oh and BTW some people are what they call ""super tasters"". I don't know if I'm one, but it is supposedly genetic and they taste bitter-ish things different / more strongly compared to other people. So that *might* be part of the problem. Personally I just can't understand how *anyone* can tolerate alcohol but I stopped trying to understand. We're all wired differently I guess."

"A friend of mine was being stalked by a creepy man.  She showed me an email she'd received as a death threat.  When I saw it, I was filled with this horrifying memory of having sent the email myself when I was drunk a week or two before.  I blanched but she thought I was just reacting in sympathy with her.  This would be totally out of character for me and the whole thing felt fake, like an implanted memory.  But I couldn't shake the feeling that I was responsible for her fear.  

The stalker was real and was eventually caught, (and it was not me), but whether I had sent the email or not I will never know."
"Looking back I think it was a bit of both. It was a certain famous mouse in Florida and I was portraying some of their classic characters. My trainer had my job when she was about 20 years younger and it seemed like a bit of her being bitter how she was treated, bitter to no longer be doing the role and how the company truly works.

I went on to see countless entertainers resort to eating disorders, Leaders making fun of us eating on break, leaders encouraging only drinking ACV and little to no food, denying our family coming through to see our characters while they where here on vacations and sending them to different rooms out of spite (every character has multiple rooms with multiple character performers working, which is a huge secret guest do not know), girls being called old after hitting 20/21, everyone turning into insecure messes and turning on one another....it is/was the most toxic environment I have ever encountered in my life. The job itself is so wonderful that most cannot see how deep the abuse goes, but it was a nightmare."

"I have a sixth sense.

Not in the weird woo-woo bullshit way, but in the bonafide 'I actually have a sense that other people don't have' way.

A few years ago I had a magnet implanted in my finger. When I'm out and about this magnet reacts by turning and vibrating inside of my finger as I pass through electromagnetic fields, allowing me to 'feel' them. If I'm really close to a powerful field, I can actually feel the shape of it by moving my hand around and through it. If we want to be technical, I'm really just co-opting my sense of touch and a small bit of my cortex, but that doesn't sound nearly as cool. Either way, it's been with me for so long that I don't even think about the sensations anymore unless they're novel. It's simply a part of my reality/existence now.

As for why: I used to do circuit design and the magnet was a quick way of telling me roughly what had power going through it and what didn't. At least that's the excuse I gave myself. Now that I do other things it's basically an 'interesting thing' that starts conversations. Also, I can pick up paperclips, bottle caps, etc, so it's a good bar trick. And at bars you can win free drinks by doing a 'magic trick' and letting them guess how it's done."

If you don't take it now, it's gone!""

"Years back, I worked with a Japanese animator in California. His English was so-so. We were driving back to the studio one day after lunch. My programmer (he's American) says, ""I need to drop the kids off at the pool when we get back to the office,""

The main difference between the two sons was that the prodigal recognized his absolute reliance on his Father's mercy, while the ""faithful"" son felt he had earned right-standing by his better behavior and felt superior to his brother.

Jesus consistently challenged the super-religious Pharisees of his day that held strictly to the letter of the Jewish law, but were puffed up with pride because of their obedience. At either end of the spectrum, austere legalism or excessive hedonism, humanity is sinful and in need of God's grace. 

As for the ""why bother"" question, Romans 6 addresses this in detail. The motivation for good deeds is out of gratitude for what God has given us, not in order to earn anything from God. After all, there is no way that we could ever put the creator in a place where he would ""owe us a favor"".

"Ok so Mr. Jerkface comes in my store everyday. Orders a sandwich and a large coffee. Never says hello, never smiles, never specifies if he wants cream or sugar, never says anything other than ""large iced coffee"". How he wants his coffee and the fact that he also wants a sandwich is assumed.

Anyway I take his order and ask for his payment. Normally he hands me a $10 bill but this time he unloads a big pile of change. $7.50 worth ). Ok, fine Mr. Jerkface. But before I count the change I leave to put the sandwich in the oven. Welp, looks like we're out of that type of sandwich. I ask him if he wants another. Nope just wants his money back. I say ""Sure"" and hand him his big pile of change back on the counter in front of him. "

"We have a rescue border collie, he's scared of strangers (especially children) and will bite, but only if they stare, yell or reach out to touch him. We obviously muzzle him when he's out in public, and one day we took him to the pub and tethered him under the table, everyone's happy. 

I heard a lady tell her young son nearby, very slowly and deliberately, that the doggy has a muzzle on - don't look at him and give him lots of space when you walk by him. I was so happy, I looked over and we exchanged a quick smile. Just a small precaution from her kept everyone safe and peaceful.

The problem became when one of the telemarketers decided to google him and we learned that the ""wrong place at the wrong time"" was a bit of an understatement.  He had just spent about 20 years in prison because he was found to have possibly murdered his sister during a night of drinking and then violated her corpse with Lincoln Logs.  I repeat, **VIOLATED HER CORPSE WITH LINCOLN LOGS**.

Except one deuce didn't go down. I flushed 8 times and it didn't go. Everything else did! Not it. She was made aware and we spent he rest of the day flushing whenever we could. It. Didn't. Go. Down. 

I get up the next day and I'm getting sick of this. It's starting to reek up the whole bathroom when we flush and I've contacted the building people to take a look. I'm not going to inflict this on them though. The turd has got to go. She is away at work and I'm home alone. 

I took drastic measures. I sacrificed a plastic lid to lift it out, throw it in a bag, wrap it up, and took it to the trash can on the curb. She is very sorry and appreciative that I did that, but it didn't feel very mortifying.

"Eh, not so much anti-capitalism as much as it was about identity in any society that commoditizes the individual. People who are only visible as cogs in a machine to the point where they could show up with black eyes to an office job and nobody would ask questions (something that happened to the author that inspired the book).

The main character, eroniously, sees himself as a stunted, emasculated number. He's won society. He got the degree, got the job, got the modern furniture and feels nothing for it. He creates an imaginary friend that's everything he wants to be, and ironically, a product of the very cultural expectations he sets to destroy.

The movie and book are very much against fight clubs themselves. Durden is a joke. He's the ""cool guy"" society says is cool is the cool guy projected from somebody that has completely succumb to those expectations. He's Holden Caulfield meets John Rambo (played by Brad Pitt at the height of his sex appeal). Everything he says is ""bad ass"" and specifically resonates with people that, like the narrator, feel like they aren't men anymore.

Fight clubs evolve into terrorist groups of men that blame the system for devaluing them as an individual and, un-ironically, join a much more disciplined system that takes away their name and turns them into ""monk[ies] ready to be shot into space."" 

The people that join them are not supposed to be (fully) identified with. We, as viewers/readers, are supposed to identify with Norton's character and realize that there is a too far. It's not about destroying capitalism, it's about realizing who we are in the chaos of conformity. It's about how anti-conformity is just as bad (if not worse) than conformity. In then end, if you're ready to blow one up, it might be good to just shoot the other in the head. "

"""Any reason"" is not really true though. It must be a reason that does not go against EEOC, or any discrimination laws as they would lose any subsequent lawsuit and even possibly have to return you to your former position. For example, an employer in an ""at will"" state can legally fire you for color of clothes, attitude or they are having a bad day. They cannot fire you because you are a Jew or Muslim, the lawsuit that would ensue would not only cost them a lot of money, but could get the fired employee their job back with back pay(not that I think anyone who was fired for that would want to go back even though it could be possible).

"Being bisexual. 
Depending on where you live:

You get shit from the gay people, who think you don't exist. 

You get shit from straight people who think you're just 'in transition' 

You get shit from religious nuts who think you have a better chance at redemption, because you're 'only half way there.' 

And no, I don't want to have a threesome to spice up your struggling relationship. "

"This was my late 90's childhood. My mother would get yet another massager and show it off to everyone and we'd all massage each other's backs with it.

She even gave me her old ones...

The first time I realized what these massagers could be used for was when I had crawled into bed with my mother. She was clearly shocked and annoyed when I suddenly barged into her room. I got into her bed, and when I rolled over there was the massager, and the head was right in my crotch! I thought ""That's strange. Why was she massaging herself there?""

Then I finally figured it out.

And I never slept in my mother's bed again."

When she did all of this, her son had already been named Emperor. She was Empress Dowager.

Because of her, her son had taken to making sure his little brother (Consort Qi's son) was always with him. Just so happened he wanted to go hunting and wanted to sleep in a bit more so the Emperor left without his brother thinking his Mom had gotten over it and wouldn't try.

20 minutes later (or so), he raised his hand.
-Excuse me sir, I have no pencil to complete the exam.

"I used to own a well known pedicab company in Orlando. I would still ride as it was a fun job. One night I had a customer that deserved and received a smart comment from me. He demanded the contact information for the manager/owner so I handed him one of my cards. It gave my name, number and position in the corporation. He proceeded to say something along the lines of 'you won't have a job tomorrow' and walked away while dialing his phone.

Of course my phone starts ringing so I answer it. I have a fairly distinct voice and the guy immediately knows that it is me. He turns around and chucks his phone at me. This was pre smart phone so it may have been a Nokia....he missed."

She did this so much that the wait staff just expected to comp her check -- and she was rude as fuck and never tipped. I finally got sick of it and told her, when she did her usual song and dance, that I would comp it one last time, but that I knew her game now and should she ever return, she would be asked to leave.

"After my dad sold his restaurants in the early 70's he got bored after a while and ended up becoming part of an MLM called ""Bestline Products"". Soap / detergent related products, all super concentrated. 

As I remember what trapped him was their appeal to his vanity that the people who bought in on this were way smarter than the average schmuck. In any case whatever psychological tricks these folks use worked perfectly on him. 

He bought thousands of dollars worth of product, signed up a number of friends but neither he nor any of his friends ever went out and sold any of it. We ended up using most of the stuff over 10+ years, and really it was a break even proposition for him financially from what I calculated. It also didn't suck having free laundry detergent and other cleaning supplies through college.

I particularly liked the air fresheners, which were incredibly flammable. You could easily get 4 feet of fire off the cans. We had cases of the stuff and as a teenager my friends and I would have real life flame wars near the creek in our neighborhood.

Last night I was driving and I got pulled over for speeding, now this sounds retarded right because speeding is something you should be pulled over for.

He said ""You were going 48 in a 35"" and I was going 48, but I said that there was no sign to say that there was a different speed on this road after the uturn. He responded by saying that this was something I just had to know. "

"It took me a few years to learn how to deal with periods properly, especially with my flow being unexpectedly heavy at times. Being an awkward, dirty middle schooler just made this so much worse. I was afraid of asking to go to the bathroom during class, afraid of someone seeing me grab a pad from my locker, and didn't always have time in between classes to stop in the bathroom anyway (4 minutes to race across to the other side of the building is not enough!). So I just dealt with a gross wet pad (or paranoia that it was full) and tried to sit in a way that would prevent leaks if it was too full. 

After bleeding through to my pants too many times, I learned to wear black pants on the first couple days of my period and always have a sweatshirt in case I needed to hide my butt (I was always cold anyway).

"Not my con, but my grandma's:              

One day years ago she was out and about in town and noticed her brother's car parked nearby. They were very close. He was nowhere to be found, so she left him a little note, something to the effect of ""hey, saw your car, sorry I missed you"" and signed it ""The Green Phantom"" (a reference to their Irish heritage). She figured he would know who it was or it wouldn't amount to much of anything.                

Well, shortly thereafter, she finds out he's been asking around everywhere trying to figure out who this mysterious Green Phantom is, and nobody knows. So she takes advantage. She starts leaving him more messages on his car, at home, wherever. Then she starts sending him letters in the mail, postcards from distant locations, birthday gifts and signs them all ""The Green Phantom."" And she gets others involved in it too so it's not obvious that these messages are all coming from wherever it is that she has traveled. You're going to France? Here, take this birthday card with and stick in the mailbox. You're visiting from New Jersey? When you get home, mail this gift to my brother, would you?              

She and everyone kept the secret for years and years, over a decade I believe, and he had no idea it was his own sister. He eventually was diagnosed with cancer and became increasingly ill. On what became clear would be his last birthday, she got decked out in all green including a long green cape, and came to his birthday party as The Green Phantom herself. He was shocked and thrilled at the reveal. He cried. Many people cried I'm sure. Wish I could've been there."

"I wish I could write about a real-life Clarice Starling who's out kicking ass, but my response is going to dryly explore trends and contributing factors instead. There are almost certainly similar numbers of potential serial killers out there per capita, but the odds of them getting caught or killed early has gone up. There's a decent chance they're serving a sentence for their first murder or an earlier crime, which makes this whole argument a little tougher to quantify. 

Declining privacy (or maybe 'anonymity' is the better word) is tripping them up. A few decades ago, it was still feasible for a serial killer without a serious full-time job to afford a home with an attached garage near a significant population center. Good luck swinging that now without roommates, a spouse, or family cohabiting that space and asking awkward questions about why they're not allowed in the basement. That has tended to push them toward hurting people elsewhere, which increases their odds of being captured early. 

Our online presence in general has helped out too. Social media has made it more likely for people to notice when a victim goes missing and get the word out. This tends to jumpstart an investigation, and will increase the likelihood of arrest. Although there are still plenty of vulnerable people out there, it cuts down on the likelihood of someone eerily disappearing without a trace. Online activity can cut the other way as well: Israel Keyes was tracked throughout the southwest by law enforcement monitoring his bank account and caught early. A few decades ago, this would have been a lot more difficult to coordinate. 

I won't jump too deeply into the proliferation in general surveillance, scientific advances aiding investigation, and clever policing policies. Odds are they've helped keep the death toll down, but I don't know enough about the topic to speak on it. "

"Nah, that's a good reaction. Pyrotechnic practical jokes can be harmless like this one, but it could easily escalate. IT's not uncommon for people to put fireworks and works bombs in mailboxes to blow them up. But sometimes they don't go off properly which could easily injure the next person opening it as any movement can cause defective items to go off. This way, the kid never gets the idea that this sort of prank is okay, and never escalates to more dangerous kinds of firework pranks and vandalism. 

This event taught the kid a lesson he won't ever forget, and no one got injured or ended up with a criminal record. I'd do the same thing if I found something rigged with strings and smelling like pyrotechnics.(Those string bangers leave a lingering smell, there's no way the mailman didn't notice it.)  That's sketchy as fuck. If I were delivering mail I'd probably conclude someone was trying to murder or disfigure me. Even if I saw that it was just a little firecracker, it's probably still a good idea to report someone rigging booby traps on mailboxes. "

then again, she was kinda crazy give that

&gt;One day in 1977, Chase rang his mother's doorbell and greeted her by thrusting a dead cat in her face. He then threw the cat to the ground, knelt down, ripped its stomach open with his bare hands, and stuck his hands inside the cat, smearing its blood all over his face while screaming. His mother calmly returned inside the house and did not report the incident to anyone."

Every day, when she came into class, the football jock who sat behind me would mutter, under his breath, ""God, she's so ugly.  She'll never have kids, who could bring themselves to fuck that bitch.""  Every day, I turned around, looked him in the eye and told him to shut up.  But being the nice girl I used to be, I didn't curse or threaten.  He'd just laugh.  

Since he was all sotto voce about it, it stayed like that a while, because I thought she couldn't hear him.  But it pissed me off. And every day he did it, it pissed me off more.  The teacher heard us, and never did a damn thing about it.  Every day.  For weeks.

She came in late one day, breathing hard from running to beat the bell in Florida spring, sweaty and dropped her books as she came in the door.  Jock boy starts yelling, ""Good God, you ugly cow, you can't even get your fat ass in through the door without dropping all your shit!""  Everyone heard him.  Teacher heard him.  Did nothing, as usual. The girl teared up, picked up her books.

I turned around for the fiftieth time, stood up this time, leaned over his desk and into his face and told him to call me an ugly cow and see what happens.  He turned red, started stuttering and told me to sit my ass down.  I leaned over more and yelled it again into his face, ""Come on, big man, tell me I'm an ugly cow! Do it!""  

Teacher was slightly concerned at this point, says, ""Scarlettjax, just sit down and let's get on with class."" I looked at the teacher and said, ""Hell no, if you ain't gonna do nothing about this asshole I am.  I'm sick of his bullshit.""  Teacher then yells for me to get out of the class and go to the dean.  I said I would when this dumbass failing motherfucker tells me I'm an ugly cow.  By this time the class is joining in, half telling him to tell me I'm an ugly cow and the other half telling me to knock him out.  

Football boy has tears in his eyes too by now.  His original victim has quit crying and is just staring at the show.  I leaned right into his face one last time, and said, ""Didn't think so.""  He said he was sorry.  I told him, ""Tell her.""  He glanced in her general direction and murmured an apology.  

I gathered up my crap and went the dean.  Got a week's worth of detention for cussing in class.  Totally worth it.  Got moved to the back row of the class away from jockstrapette and met an exchange student from Columbia who changed my life.  Totally worth it.  "
"Being a 'night person' is about whats called your circadian rhythm. Some people are naturally wired that way. It has an evolutionary purpose, because someone had to be on alert for predators while the other cave people slept Lol.

There is a big difference between a 'night person'  and someone who has episodes of hyper-mania &amp; hypo-mania. Bi-Polar/Manic Depression and/or Thyroid issues will cause issues with a persons overall functioning. Someone who is a night person could hold a 3rd shift job indefinitely. The latter probably could not. "
"Got what was coming to him, don't worry about the video existing"
My mom always told us that she was either full or didn't want anything from McDonald's whenever we went there. I don't ever remember my mom eating a McDonald's meal when we were kids. I started to think that it was just kids food and adults didn't eat there. Turns out we were just broke AF and she couldn't afford to get herself something so she just went without.
"I have a similar one. Boyfriend and I in high school thought we were alone. So we weren't holding back. Guess his mom came home early and heard us. So She banged on the ceiling, and yelled up at him. Safe to say I couldn't look her in the eye and I avoided going back there at all costs after that. "
Tell this to my mother in law. She decided that I must be infertile since we don't have kids yet and has decided to tell members of the family this false info. We aren't trying to get pregnant. But she asks about it every 3 days or so.

"I had a schizophrenic mom, with weird af random rules, as well. Though she was the paranoid variety combined with bipolar so breaking the rules was often imagined by her and severely punished (but not in her imagination unfortunately).

Shit like it being expected to have zero problem with taking a shit or showering in a room with her if she didn't feel like leaving (not sexual; I'm female too and she never did lurid shit, she was just fucking weird). Always wearing shoes in the house. Drinking pickle juice instead of throwing it away. Not being allowed to sit on certain seats. Constant attempts at picking all of my eyebrows off. That sort of shit.

Amusingly, I had the opposite thing about shoes. My mother was concerned my feet were too *big*, so she forced me to wear shoes that were too small.

I have insanely high arches now and my feet hurt easily from standing too long, but hey my feet are 2 sizes smaller so thanks mom"

Still better than how I was without them though.   
I just feel like the people who say this stuff have never actually experienced clinical depression.  Then again, if they did and now they are on the other side then they are seeing things that I *can't* see from my vantage point on account of being in a fucking dark hole of hopelessness.  
  Maybe previously depressed people just forget what it's like."

And again, Trump has not yet passed economic legislation, so if you like the economy, it's Obama's economy you're liking.

Illegal border crossing is actually down, can't argue that. Although you're giving it specific numbers, when we don't have any really specific numbers on that particular metric.

And never mind all those things, we have serious ethics lapses at the highest levels of government and assaults on our Democracy go unanswered.

"I'll share a story of mine:

Get an anonymous complaint call through our 800 number, which is intended for environmental crimes (think ivory, poaching, stuff like that), so it's answered by the state police. The officer who took the message noted that it was for an autobody shop operating without a permit that illegally dumped waste and other somewhat serious allegations. 

I meet the officer out there, and we knock on the guy's door. Give him the standard talk ""we got a complaint etc."" and the officer starts asking questions. Now, our cops are a little different than regular patrol cops...but you're still getting interrogated by a guy wearing a bullet proof vest with ""police"" on it and carrying a gun that showed up in a police cruiser. Not a good day. Meanwhile, I'm looking around this guy's shop. It's cluttered, but I'm not finding anything that is against any regulation we have. We go out on his property, and he's got his batteries stored off the ground (as is required), used tires neatly stacked in one place (and not even close to the quantity needed to require a permit), there's no obvious spilled fluids or anything. Cluttered, sure...but certainly not in violation of any requirements.

The officer asks about any body work, and the guy says that he does have a paint booth in a separate building out back. We walk in, and the booth is immaculately clean. Easily one of the best looking ones I've seen in my career. Brand new filters, all his containers are covered and sealed, he's got the right kind of spray guns...very nice equipment that's obviously been well cared for. Not a violation to be seen. We thanked the guy for his time and left."

"This happened about 14 years ago but back when I was a practicing Catholic I worked in the church nursery taking care of kids (paid way above minimum wage, we were able to choose our hours, and essentially just sat there watching Disney movies with the kids). 

Anyways, I was asked to play Pontius Pilate in the Easter play for the church (me being selected as the guy who eventually sentenced Jesus to death is telling) so we had rehearsals. 

I was scheduled to work for an hour before the play and the Catholic rules at the time required two workers since no child should be left alone with one ""adult"". The chick I was working with apparently had back issues that day (really she was just a lazy POS that eventually got hooked on meth) and I had to leave about 10 minutes early for rehearsal. 

The chick told me that she couldn't hold the kid so I should take him back to his mom. This chick was about 3-4 years older than me so I listened as she was essentially a ""higher up"" in the nursery. 

The mom told my boss who fired me for not doing my job. 

I also got fired from a local toy store that had a rule that you couldn't lean against the front desk to give your feet a rest and I called out the manager for physically sitting on the desk after she yelled at me for leaning. "

"Might get buried, but I actually just witnessed a few the other day. I just started working at an unnamed hazardous waste incineration facility about two months ago. It's a hell of an interesting place to work because we feed liquid and shredded solid waste into the eight story unit, which vaporizes it instantly in a 1600 degree fire tornado. Four times a year we shut down to pull everything apart and clean/replace a bunch of parts and pieces, one of which sessions we just completed this week. Now OSHA and the EPA are about nine fingers deep in the plant's asshole about safety, but there are tons of ways around all of their mandated measures (like lock out/ tag out) and it seems like our supervisors love taking those shortcuts to speed up production.
My job is to mix our solid wastes in a set of giant hoppers with a clamshell crane, and then feed it into the conveyer system via another hopper. The waste is carried six floors up to a pair of chutes where it is then fed into the unit. As part of our shutdown procedure we run the conveyers clean of to unplug all the waste that gets crammed in nooks and crannies. Dry waste being fed into the incinerator acts as a sort of check valve - a plug of waste about two feet thick prevents fire from leaving the unit and shooting a massive fireball into the building where I mix and feed.
Well, early this week we ran the conveyors clean and some genius decides it's a good time to clean out the top of the waste chute WHILE THE UNIT IS STILL ON. It's a terrible idea, but there's a lock out procedure for a special slide gate that can cover that feed chute and close it off to be cleaned out. There's a short radio conversation between my coworker and my supervisor discussing the merits of closing the slide gate. Said conversation ends in ""Ah, fuck it, it'll take too long.""
Coworker unbolts the 150 pound hatch, which proceeds to blow of with the force of a rail gun, and the 1600 degree incinerator begins shooting 60 foot long fireballs out of what is essentially just an air port in its side. Fire alarms go off, people freak, and we have the fire under control about half an hour later. As soon as the fire is out, my supervisor asks me to go down to the basement level of my building to see if there was any fire damage on the main conveyor. I was half suited up when one of my (good) coworkers stopped me and advised me to wait another half an hour, because the unit was still prone to shooting fireballs down my conveyer (which my supervisor neglected to tell me).

That guy didn't even get written up. Neither did my supervisor."

It definitely needed stitches, instead of taking him to the hospital they brought him back to the first aid office that worked in, I basically just put band-aids on little kids that had scraped their knees and coached people what to do about their bloody noses,  that was about the limit of our first aid without calling 911. One of the outdoor managers came into the first aid office and superglued this guy's hand. I dont know if the company was too cheap to deal with a workmans comp claim or if the guy couldn't pass the drug test you get after filing a workmans comp claim or what was going on.

"Oh man.

I used to work for specialty food/produce company as a graphic designer/photographer. 

I often had to go into the giant warehouse to get the products to take pictures of, including produce. 

The rule was if I didn't have to cut the fruit open, after I took the picture, I would bring it back to the warehouse where they would put it back in the case to sell.

This was borderline unhygienic, but was okay until I got whopping cough. The company had no paid sick leave and I could not afford to take time off, I was at work. 

I told my boss and company heads that I was very sick and that whopping cough was contagious for a while, even while I started treatment. They told me that I had to come to work or I would get fired.

I told them that if I had to be at work, then I should probably just stay in my office away from people, and I definitely shouldn't go into the warehouse to handle food and that food absolutely should not be put back to sell.

No go. 

I asked for a face mask and gloves.

They said, maybe next quarter

I still had to go into the warehouse everyday coughing and hacking and spreading my illness all over the produce that then went out all over the country and into peoples mouths.

TLDR: I spread whopping cough because my company is horrible."

No one went in because wimps, we just closed the door and replaced the chair. That night my brother and i pushed the beds together because none of us wanted to sleep near the spidery window and fell asleep. 
I woke up in the middle of the night and since i wear glasses it was pretty blurry but i notice something out of the corner of my eye. Theres a woman sitting in the chair just looking at us. I didnt feel threatened or scared. I remember just staring back and then turning around and falling asleep again. She was wearing a dress but everything else was pretty blurry. 
When we woke up and started getting ready for the day my brother mentioned if i had seen anything weird last night and i didnt want to sound crazy so i just said there were weird shadows that looked like a person. He asked if it looked like a woman. And i said yes. 
He asked if she was wearing a dress. 
Yes, again. 
We just nodded at eachother and didnt talk about it again until we got older. 
The place was creepy though. We found a locked room on the first floor later that day which had nailed windows and thick window coverings. Never rented it again even though it was a great value and beautiful.

"There are a number of reasons I don't pee in the shower.  In no particular order, here are the top three:

- The toilet is right there.  It's not like I'm going to have to create a fellowship of dwarves, elves, and hobbits to make the journey to the toilet.

- I'm not going to wait till I'm in the shower to pee.  Any time I need to shower, I need to pee more, so the first thing I do in the bathroom is to pee. 

- I have to clean the shower.  And if you think it doesn't matter, I can tell you that back when I had roommates, I knew where they peed, and that cleaning that area took more work."

"An old guy gave me a bottle of whiskey as a thank you for looking for his wife who had a long suffering dementia illness. I don't love whiskey but he does and it was a really sweet gesture.

Fast forward two years and this guy got diagnosed with a terminal cancer which he didn't fight too hard to be honest and who can blame him. He died today; however a couple of nights ago I visited him in hospital, and being a doctor who knows all the staff and having worked there before, I brought him back his bottle and we had a drink together. The I grabbed his chart and wrote him up for a measure before bed each night.

Bragging is the wrong word here but I hope my actions brought him a little taste of joy in his final moments as he waited to rejoin his beloved wife."

"I had a job for which I raised sales from $2.4M/yr to about $5.6M/yr while reducing customer acquisition costs 10%, and the increased sales was at roughly 65% profit. They went from about $800K profit per year with $220K per year in advertising expenses to $200K in advertising expenses and $2.1M in profits over the course of about 6 months. No other metrics changed, including warehousing, staffing, support costs or soft costs associated with web and database hosting.

During that time I also implemented migrating profiles and a VPN so that employees could work remotely, got them on legal OSes instead of pirated, improved their internal hosting and uptime and consolidated their hosted domains to a single point for administration as well as standardizing their websites and upgrading from Frontpage web 1.0 nightmares to clean, CSS based sites that could be edited for format or content individually. When I hit my 1 year mark they offered me a raise from $10/hr to $31,200 salary. Since I was putting in close to 60 hours every week I would have actually lost money by taking their offer and when I told them this they acted like I was attacking them and even resorted to insults and threats to bully me into taking it.

I took down the new sites I'd built for them and restored them to the web 1.0 nightmares, deleted my rolodex of business contacts and leads and wrote a script to purge my profile and access from the AD server as well as , then put in my resignation and ran the script. Since I was originally hired as tech support they never had me sign an NDA or IP clause, I also had purged the info and didn't take any of it with me. Also since I was never actually classified as sales there was no agreement on who was the owner of my leads and contacts. I heard from someone who still worked there for a while after I left that they were planning on suing but apparently had no case. Last I heard they were bought out."

When the construction workers were replacing the bridge over the creek near the house, my dad let them park all of their heavy equipment on the driveway convinced them to dump all the excess dirt(More than 1000 cubic yards, and he only had to pay them for a few hours of work with their bulldozer and excavator to change it to a useful shape! Absurdly good deal.) on our property. As well as all the old bridge parts, which we used to build a giant deck on the house.

"So, you set up these dummy corporations to deposit fraudulent payroll checks into an account - the account is held by the same dummy corporation or another. When the money comes in you wire the funds directly out of the account into an account at Ecobank, Africa's largest bank which allows you to open accounts without any verification. You have an associate in France pull the money out of the Ecobank location in France and wire the money back to America. 

Then you buy a strip club, launder the money through the strip club and voila - you have legitimate cash in your bank account with no ties to the money stolen. Use it to pay off people's debt and shit.

edit: to save myself from a ""random"" IRS audit (put on your tin foil hat here, people) I just want to say that stealing money from banks who steal money from you isn't something you should do. And definitely not something that you should do in the manner by which I described, because it would work fairly well and the people who don't want you to do it don't want it to work well."

"It's because you imagine talking about sex is like an episode from sex in the city or some shit. Where I work it's a very common topic. When my friend/co-worker is telling me how his leg cramped up and how he cried out some high pitch curl that ruined the mood, I'm not picturing him fucking his wife. I'm just laughing with him at a funny moment. When someone tells me they tried anal with their wife and it feels like having sex with a balloon that has a rubber band on the end, only thing going through my head is that maybe it's not worth pushing my girl to do it. When I shared that I used my reclining workout bench and it made things easy and more enjoyable I know I'm potentially helping out a friend's sex life, not his spank bank. 

I understand that to some people it's personal and embarrassing to share. I am under the belief that talking about your sex life can lead to a healthier one. I'd rather not get my only ideas from watching porn or reading a book written by one person. My good friends outside of work don't talk about it and that's okay. We don't shame each other for our different ways of doing things."

"I sort of did the same thing with my son. 

When he was 3 years old, I was pregnant with his sister. Due to it being such a horrible pregnancy, I was banned from lifting anything heavier than 5 pounds. Therefore, I couldn't really pick up my son. Usually it is fine, he would walk by me. However, one day his daycare was closed and we needed food. So I had to take him to the store with me, and have him hold my hand. 

Normally he didn't through tantrums, but this time he decided he really wanted some toy. And he wanted it now. When I said no, he threw himself onto the floor and wouldn't get up. Picking him up to leave was obviously a problem. So I grabbed the toy and we waddled to the front to pay. 

From everyone in the area's point of view, it probably looked like I had given in. However, when we got to the front, and his attention was turned away, I quietly asked the cashier to put it in their go-back bin. When my son asked where the toy was, I just said it was in one of the bags. When we got home, he asked for the toy again and I told him because he was misbehaving, I ended up not buying it. I felt bad for tricking him, and ended up buying the toy for him another day when he was acting like a perfect little gentleman. Under normal circumstances, I would have just picked him up and left, but my hands were tied at that point in time."

He was so big he had a documentary on YouTube about him and his notorious cons.

"Eh, I was convicted for unlawful possession of a shotgun, and possession of heroin and crack. Unfortunately, gun charges in my state are taken pretty seriously. My first offer was an 8 with a 5, meaning an 8 year sentence where I'd have to do 5 before becoming eligible for parole. I ended up taking a plea deal for a 3 with a 1. It was a steal, and honestly the terrible truth is that it probably wouldn't have happened if I weren't white. I ended up serving exactly 22 months from my date of arrest to my parole release date. With a sentence that short, I was never expecting to actually get out in 12 months. 

I was a terrible drug addict, selling the shit to maintain my habit. Helped some buddies burglarize two houses one day by driving them. I refused to go in. They finish house one, put a bag in the car, go to house two and proceed to get arrested. I nodded out from the drugs, awoke to police everywhere, and drove away casually. Look in the back seat and there's a fucking gun case sticking out of the bag. This wasn't my first time around the block, and I know how bad guns are to get caught with in my state, so I literally just pulled into a parking lot, took the valuable shit out of the bag, and tossed the rest including the gun case into a dumpster. 

I go home, thinking all is fine, and proceed to get arrested a couple of days later for missing an unrelated court date (dark, dark times). While sitting in jail, I find out I have warrants out of the town the burglaries were committed, and that was the only time I was ever in that particular town. My 'buddies' told on me, denied any knowledge of a gun. They were doing the one house while I was in the other, yada yada. They go home, I go to prison. I was 19 with a 1 year old son at the time, they were 30 without much in terms of family/anything of true value. I believe they're in the same boat today as they were then, so maybe they did me a favor. 

Arrested in 3/14, paroled 1/16, granted full custody of my son 4/16, completed parole 9/16, taking my son and his future step mom on our first ever family vacation Monday. 

It brings tears to my eyes to think about it. I never thought I'd be able to take him on a vacation, ever..."

He knew how to open his enclosure, even if the locks were changed he would figure it out eventually. He also knew how to open other tanks and slip inside to eat the fish in whatever tank he chose.

I've heard many other zoo's and aquariums with similar octopus experiences, the little fuckers are just too clever.  "

&gt;Does anyone outside of the crazy survivalist type really believe this is gonna happen in the US? 

History shows us that all nations fall victim to external invasion, internal stride, or collapse at some point. In the last century Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, China, and a litany of other nations though suffered these fates. Saying ""it can never happen here"" is naive. Now it might not happen for 20, 50, 100, or 300 years. But it will eventually happen.

&gt;Or furthermore that a bunch of civvies with guns would be able to do anything significant to the US military? 

Fighting tanks, attack helicopters, fighter jets, and drones with an AR15 is very difficult. However using that AR15 to deny those weapons platforms the resources they need to be effective is much easier. America has struggled in asymmetrical conflicts abroad and would fair worse at home. We could barely maintain the green zone in Baghdad, now image trying to do that concurrently in over 50 different major cities while all of your supply lines are now vulnerable to guerilla attacks."

I dug one up and gave it to her. Five minutes later, I see she'd pried the plastic open and was stabbing the ink all over her notebook.

"A few years back I had to stay in a hotel for two weeks on a training course. I arrived on the Monday after the first day's training and checked in. Went to my room and I can honestly say that it was the largest bedroom I had ever stayed in. The bed was a super king, there was a big bathroom. I was pleasantly surprised because as a business customer you normally get a shitty little room.

Had a long soak in the tub, ordered room service and watched some TV. It got to around nine so I switched the TV over to radio and went to use the bathroom before bed. When I came back something just seemed off. I just felt like there was someone else in the room. Just watching me. I got into bed, started to read, but couldn't shake the feeling. Quite frankly, I felt afraid. I must have slept for a couple of hours tops, and I kept the lamp on all night. Come daylight I brushed it off as nerves and went about my business. But that night it was just the same. Just that feeling that I was being watched. The following morning I asked to be moved but the hotel was fully booked until Friday. Every night was the same, just that creepy feeling when the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. 

I went home for the weekend and came back again on Monday. I asked for the smallest room they had. I was given a smaller different room. Luckily whatever I felt was watching me disappeared. I looked into the history of the hotel after and found it was reputedly haunted by a maid (predictably!). It had also been used recently for a celebrity laying in state (of all things!). I really can't say whether it is haunted or not, but I have stayed in a fair number of hotels for both business and leisure and I have never experienced anything like it. The thoughts of it still give me the creeps. "

"As children my sister and I got pet hamsters. I got a male, she got a female, and mine was a potential little bastard. Long and short of it: we wound up with something around 40 hamsters. But the quantity is not the real tale. Eventually my sister's hamster escaped or died or something and the others were slowly disappearing day by day. But these guys weren't escaping the cage, not at all. Turns out there were a couple cannibal hamsters biting the heads off other hamsters. My parents got rid of the last two so only my original was left. Well my sister was jealous I still had mine so they got her another, and once again, immediately after we put her in the cage mine ""got to work.""

Here is where it gets messed up. My sister's hamster died delivering her first babies. So my mom's solution was not to get a little bottle for them but instead to seal them in a zip lock bag and put them in the freezer. She explained it away to us by telling us they would have died without their mom anyways, and we just kind of accepted it. I think I was around 9 or 10 years old sister was like 5.

TL;DR: mom froze baby hamsters instead of attempting to care for em."

"I am a sufferer.  Stay busy or work hard at whatever you do.  Invest in yourself in terms of time and rewards.  Also invest in educating yourself more, whether it be business related or personal like how to talk to people.  Spend more time socially while working.  Go out with coworkers or acquaintances.  These get-togethers can grow over time into something more.  If you have family, spend more time with them.  It can be online with video feed or a simple hand written letter.  Getting better at something you are already good at is also rewarding.  For me, playing videogames and running a small at-home business has been good to me.  I also have kids who I love to spend time with buy can't due to my own set of circumstances.  When I can, it means the world to me.  The simplest answer is to just stay busy.  A busy mind and busy hands can accomplish great things if you apply what you develop.  Things do not regularly come easily or quickly.  ""Good things come to those who wait"" does not mean sit on your ass and leave the door unlocked.  I am not going to say it's OK to feel lonely.  It sucks!  But you don't have to be enslaved by it.  I hope at least one thing helps you even if it is indirectly.  Take care."

It's about a couple and the husband passed away and it's from the conversation between the two of them. We don't know if she's going crazy or if someone's actually there. We've kind of been inspired by people that lived in my house. This old couple that lived there for 30 years. The woman passed away, so it was kind of different.

"I wonder what kind of phone Brandon had, if it was a flip phone I could easily imagine how a call could end like that if he were hit by a car. After that the driver panicked and put the body in his trunk and left so he could avoid getting into trouble. Even a touch screen (like a Samsung or iPhone) could understandably drop a call like that if Brandon had been hit by a car.

That's really all I can imagine happening given the circumstances and a lack of evidence.

"I went through a divorce a year ago.

While I certainly hope any relationship I end up getting into will be life-long, I also now recognise not all relationships are meant to be that way. Some may end at some point, **and that's okay**.

I don't see my 8 years of marriage as wasted - 7 of those were DAMN good. She gave me happiness and love, and she's still a friend of mine. And so getting into that marriage, even though it ended, wasn't a mistake - I got a LOT out of it, I grew as a person, it shaped my life.

I'm not overly worried about any future relationship ending. It's likely it will be a net positive anyway, and likely a large positive. Good times and new friends outweigh the pain of the breakup, and even that can be done gently and with care, if both parties so want.

Don't be afraid. Embrace love, for even if it may end, it's still the warmth of our life."

"Not sure if this quite fits, but about 10 years ago I was in a cave in Wales on a 12 hour through trip of a beautiful system. 

We found a crack which looked like it went somewhere but we weren't sure. I'm not the smallest, but I thought I could get in easily enough, and I did. I dropped down a couple of feet and shuffled sideways further in. The crack was about ten feet long, and barely wider than my body side-on. 

There was nothing around what looked like the corner at the end. I tried to make my way back, but when I got back to the crack entrance, I realised there was no way to get a grip and pull myself out. I needed to be about 6 inches higher and there was no way to jump, wiggle or otherwise maneuver myself upwards as it was such a tight squeeze.

I struggled for a minute or two, not scared, as my friends were there too, but conscious I was pretty much stuck; 5 hours from daylight. My friends tried to pull me out but my arms were restricted and caught bent and I wouldn't budge. We stopped for a minute and everyone heard this ""boom, boom, boom, boom, boom"" noise. Pretty fucking sketchy. Everyone was quiet and I could see the colour drain from their faces, even in the lamplight. 

It seemed to be getting faster and louder and I felt like I could feel it through my entire body. My friends were shitting themselves, and I wasn't far from it either until I realised what it was.

I was so wedged against the rocks in that small crevasse that it was my heartbeat: booming against the rock and echoing down the crack and out around the chamber. Surreal. Not pleasant. As my chest was restricted and my breathing worried it became even worse and harder and harder to breathe properly. It took one hell of an effort not to panic, but I knew it would make it ten times worse.

Some ingredients always got measured (milk, oil, flour, etc.) but others I just added a fixed calorie count or ignored them completely (vegetables). Eating out meant an automatic 800 calories or so.

As long as the weight got less and I didn't feel tired this worked well for me. It was really just the first 2-3 weeks to figure out how much I'm actually eating and what the calorie count of my go-to foods is.

"Was it that racist? Sure, by today's standards it is, but back then it was considered progressive. It was a mainstream movie with a lead black character. He was also the first black actor to earn an Oscar, a campaign Disney himself heavily pushed for. And aside from the main character acting as a bit of an Uncle Tom, he was an upright and respected character. 

Then there is that one scene everyone mentions, the one with the ""Tar Baby"". Well, the story is based on a classic African American folktale that uses the term. That was the name of the thing, it was a tar baby. The term didn't start to become derogatory until around 1960s, and even then there are still academics who insist tar baby isn't a racial slur since it has an actual meaning that is years and years old. 

For his time, Disney was fairly progressive. He hired Jews, Blacks, and women and put them in leadership positions before many other Hollywood studios would even consider it. Again, when looking back at it today it's easy to call it racist, but compared to everything else in the industry, it was leading the way to be more inclusive"

"Agreed... the definition of ""Transgender"" they decide to officially use will have a big impact on the policy.

"Gaslighting.   

It has different stages to it, but it breaks your brain right from the beginning.   

Imagine that you've just seen someone do something. Right before your eyes. You confront them, ask them why they did it... and with the straightest face, the unwavering eye contact, the calmest voice, they tell you that they didn't do that. Not like you saw it. Something else happened entirely.   

At first, there's still a giant part of you that says ""I just saw you"".  

""No, you didn't"".  

They give you a little indulgent smile, envelop you in a hug. Ruffle your hair and say ""ahh, you're a weird one!"".   

That's where the first break occurs. I mean, shit.. I swear I just saw that, but their reaction is so natural. They're so convincing in their argument, and seriously.. when someone gets caught doing something, they generally look guilty and don't try to pretend it didn't happen...   

Therefore, I must have been mistaken.  

... and then it happens again, and again.  
With each occurrence, that voice you have that tells you they're wrong, it gets smaller, less certain.  

Meanwhile, their voice gets stronger. It patronises you. Starts telling you that you're seriously messed up and paranoid.  

Eventually it gets to the point where you stop mentioning the things you catch them doing. There's no point anymore. All that's going to happen is they're going to deny it, give you an alternate version, and then start criticising you for totally unrelated issues. Instead of you being able to say ""no! I saw you!"" you've suddenly been thrown into something else...  
Them: ""why did you talk to that guy last week?""  

You: ""huh? what? what guy?"" 

Them: ""You know which guy""..   

Suddenly, your brain is preoccupied with working out what they're talking about.. who did I speak to? Was I too friendly? Which one out of the 20 guys that he's told me never to talk to have I run across in the past week? Is it someone new? Surely he doesn't mean my cousin?""   

An hour or more and 3 different topics later, you've lost the energy. You don't even remember what it was that started the conversation.   

You apologise for all the things they've accused you of. You're so incredibly confused, nothing in your head is making sense and you are emotionally exhausted.   

You don't trust your memory anymore.  

You just go along with whatever they say, about anything."

I enjoyed the movie more having read the book and knowing more background about Bateman's character - stuff they didn't have time to cover.

"This used to really resonant with me during a dark time in my life. If you've ever had someone you were very close with pass away, you may find that the people you thought you could count on the most just... aren't there. When you're hurting so much already, and then you realize that people can't be bothered to listen or reach out because it makes them uncomfortable, it can make everything feel so much worse. 

For me, when I was going through a very, very bad place a lot of ""friends"" stopped communicating. When I started pretending I was okay they suddenly were blowing up my phone, begging me to come out with them, etc. They expected me to show up places, look nice, and be this outgoing and sociable person that made sure they had a good time. When I was suicidal, when I needed anyone to respond to me late at night, or just keep me from being all alone with my feelings, they couldn't be bothered to answer their phones or meet me for lunch. But I was expected to immediately jump back and put on a show so they could have a good time when they went out?

I had to distance myself. Because really, if they couldn't handle me when I wasn't smiling, they didn't deserve to have me around when I was feeling okay. "

"In the UK it is illegal to ask that. I thought it was a thing of the past until I was asked it in an interview this year. I was gobsmacked. Didn't really know what to say, answered it, a little flustered, saying I wasn't planning on children in the near future, and finished the interview. Never heard a word, but during the interview the interviewer also complained about all the overqualified people who had applied, people with degrees and even PhDs, and how surprised she was by this and how she wasn't going to hire someone who was overqualified, so I knew where I stood anyway - I've got an undergrad and a masters degree in ancient history and archaeology."
"It is illegal in the States as well, that's why interviewers often ask questions like ""So, tell me more about yourself?"", ""What are your current short-term goals?"", or ""Where do you see yourself in five years?"".



By asking open-ended questions, the interviewer avoids having directly asked about disability, sexual orientation, age, and other protected subjects. It isn't illegal for the candidate to bring those subjects up in their answers, so interviewers try to phrase their open-ended questions in a manner that will net a response to the questions they can't legally ask.


A common question use for determining a candidates age is ""What year did you graduate?"". Determining disability is ""Is there anything that you would want us to be aware of in the case of an emergency?"". The list goes on, unfortunately."

"My favourite story from my Grandpa.
He was a Cpl. (I believe) in one of the Engineer regiments.
Basically he would got to the front lines and setup mobile mechanic workshops in order to repair tanks, jeep, trucks etc in the battlefield.

He told me a story that how one day he was underneath a tank carrying out a repair when he heard footsteps, he looked to the side and saw boots, moving gingerly around the tank. German boots. He cursed himself for leaving his machine gun over by the work bench, so waited for the German soldier to pass by a little and then he slid out quietly from under the tank up behind the German soldier. His weapon? The very large wrench he was using to fix the tank. Bring the wrench to bear he struck the German soldier and ""killed him stone dead""
He didn't really finish the story with any further details. For me he never needed to, I was his young Grandson and I was enthralled by the story. Made even more special by the presentation at the end of the tale of a pair of German binoculars that my grandpa took from the dead soldier. Complete with a cracked lens from the incident.

Now, like other posts here I have zero evidence to back this story up, I have no idea if there would be an incident report or similar. I very much doubt it. I can't imagine they had time for that sort of admin on the battlefields of World War 2.

But as a young boy on my Grandpa's knee I believed it, and the young boy inside me now who still misses my Grandpa believes it too."

I am a white blonde girl who, at least I had thought, checked them in kindly and even got them in their room early. It definitely was an eye opener.

"Ohhhh boy. Let's start by saying we should have googled him first. 
IT hired this guy to work in our support team answering customer emails and phone calls. Dude was totally qualified, if you believe the resume, and basically a nice young kid. Exactly what we were looking for in a candidate. Before hiring they had called references and he had good replies, people said the usual stuff. He can lack motivation sometimes, showed up late a few times but generally solid guy. 
Flash forward to his first day. In training he starts cussing like a sailor. By like noon we're kinda laughing but he answers the phone okay and directed the call. Then he responds to a customer email, not been with us for five hours yet, by saying ""Shit be broke!""
Not cool. Just then, there's a banging on the front door and the admin answers it. ""Is that fucker Bill* here!? I'll kill him!"" Woah. New guy has people that want to kill him! Dude is yelling and screaming, trying to push into the office more. We get that handled and get him outside. He starts telling us that Bill used to be his room mate and he stole some valuable paintings and some other stuff. He's wanted by police and immigration. They want him deported, again! 
Apparently this dude saw Bill's car and was ready to throw down. We told Bill we can't have that and with the shit broke comment, he should not come back. Then we googled him. It was all true and more! Had been deported twice, caught in a art theft ring, stolen couches and shit. Crazy stuff. So we all look at our IT director saying, ""You didn't even google him!?"" We google all prospective employees now. "

"The same as any other pain-inducing sexual activity. For one the pain releases chemicals that make you feel different and for some people that enhances sexual experience. It also plays into being a submissive, giving up control to someone else and allowing them to do 'whatever they want' to you also creates a really profound psychological experience that can enhance sexual experience. Not having to decide anything, not being in control, both of those create a much different dynamic between partners, and the level of trust you must have as well as the aftercare that a partner provides after activities like this also create strong emotional feelings that can enhance the entire experience even beyond the pure physical sensations one has. 

It's like how lots of girls like when a guy just takes control, throws them down, and *fucks* them seemingly without regard to their feelings. This is a common fetish among women. Straight male submissives have a different dynamic that doesn't allow that as much since they can't be physically dominated as easily, so that's why you typically see pain-play with male subs. "

"Was walking back to my car from work on a hot day. I realized a lady had followed me to the parking lot to my car (first red flag). She asked for a ride to the hospital. She looked like she had been crying or was in pain or something, so I figure she needed help.

I asked her for the hospital name and she said it was nearby. She couldn't remember the name (second red flag), but vaguely said it was on certain streets. Okay, fine, that's not too far. The area it was in was kinda shady and I almost hit a stray dog walking across the street. The lady didn't even notice-- she seemed out of it, like she was falling asleep but also like on the verge of tears all the time. She kept asking me to crank up the AC. I tried to ask her what happen, she only said she got in a fight with some friends. Then she would zone out/fall asleep again.

We passed the area where the hospital should have been. There's no hospital nearby and she is not coherently giving me any real answers. I think maybe she's about to faint or something, or that she's very sick. I tell her we will go to a hospital I actually know about it. She doesn't really respond, just stays in the car.

I drive her to the hospital I know of. *She doesn't want to get out*. That should have been the biggest red flag there was and I should have ended it right there, but I didn't know how to coax her to get out of the car at that point, short of physically dragging her out (I am a small lady). She says she wants to be dropped off at her friend's place instead. SERIOUSLY?? I ask her where her friends are. AGAIN, she gives me a vague street name. I look it up on my phone (and believe me, at this point I had shoved the phone in front of her face and she was still being vague), see the mall is nearby. She says the mall is fine. We start driving to the mall.

Remember, this is after work and this next place was NOT nearby. I get stuck in rush hour traffic with who I'm becoming INCREASINGLY sure is a homeless woman. And she must be drug addicted or something because, again, I'm stuck in traffic and I can't even make small talk with her because she is just out of it-- looks teary-eyed and asleep and keeps cranking up the AC. 

We end up at the mall. I tell her to get out. She says it's the wrong place. REALLY? I tell her this is the last time I can drive her somewhere. I ask her if I can take her to the police-- she says no. Earlier in this whole road trip, I think I mentioned my home and she has the fucking balls at this point to ask where I live now. At this point I'm annoyed and also kind of getting fearful.

She gives me another location, promises me that this her stop. I tell her right away ""Okay, but this is the last stop, I cannot keep driving you around like this, I have places to be (home)."" When we get there this time, I open the door, take my keys out, open the door on her side, and tell her she has to get out. Hesitantly, she gets out.

...And almost like out of habit, she asks for money for the bus before she goes.

So, TL;DR basically I'm 99% sure I picked up a homeless drug addict who convinced me to drive around just so she could be out of the sun for a while. BUT, the silver lining is, JESUS CHRIST, I could have been mugged or killed or raped or worse. In retrospect, I cannot believe I was so naive to let some random stranger into my car, not to mention give her a ride to THREE different places before I caught on. Smh. S. M. H."

"I think that that thing that really did it for me about even the mainstream Mormon Church was how corrupt it was right from the start. 

Smith only introduced polygamy to his followers after his wife caught him with a 13 year-old girl. 

""Oh, God told me that polygamy is a tenant of the righteous years ago, but I didn't want to bring it up."" 

Brigham Young orchestrated a massacre of innocent homesteaders and then passed the buck onto a local Native tribe who then got themselves massacred by the U.S. military. 

They only started letting black people into the religion because the optics of not doing so were too bad for PR purposes. Same reason for dropping polygamy. The religion itself was founded on racism.

To this day, the prophets and elders of the church can just change things around to whatever suites them best. 

I know a few people who are Mormon and they're very nice, I have no issue with them, but the inner workings and history of their religion is just without question, bad. 

I've studied Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Mormonism and of the four, Mormonism is the worst fundamentally in my mind. 

People bash Islam because of the terrorists you see in the news, but when you actually study the texts and teachings of the religion, it's basically in the middle between Judaism and Christianity in terms of actual doctrine. Mormonism was a cult made by a guy who failed a divining water and gold and needed money. 


EDIT: I'm reading this, and I'm coming across the exact same way the Islamaphobes and r/atheism brats do on here. Let me be clear, I don't hate Mormonism. I don't think it's this evil religion that's out to destroy the world, or that practicing Mormons are bad. I think that the vast majority of practicing Mormons from the mainstream church are very nice and are just out to serve God the best they know how, that may be in a very conservative way, but I don't think there's any malice there. The difference between what I'm saying at what someone like Walid Shoebat would say about Islam is that whatever misgivings I have about the religion itself, I don't attach to the followers who say that they don't agree with that aspect of the religion or don't agree with that interpretation. 

If a Muslim believes that Islam explicitly forbids terrorism, I'm not going to sit there and yell at them asking them how they could follow a religion that could birth ISIS. That's just not a valid discussion.

The scholarly study and examination of a religion is the ability to realize that practitioners of said religion are likely not following the doctrine to the letter and each interpretation of the religion has to be assigned to the person. "

""Literally"" has been used to mean ""figuratively"" or ""hyperbolically"" since the 1700s, *at least*.

Various famous, esteemed, respected writers have used it as such throughout the 20th century.

Both the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam Webster have listed the ""figurative"" usage of ""literally"" as a valid definition since the early 1900s.

The only thing that is ""new"" in the past decade or so, is people complaining about the usage *as if it were a new development*.  This results in a Baader-Meinhof effect, and people keep passing on this ""newly-discovered wisdom"" to the next victim."

"Assuming you could get a spoon that is small enough to fit in your mouth but also sturdy enough that could scoop lava. 

If we can immediately get 2nd/3rd degree burns from frying oil that is usually about 400F 

Lava being 2000F would definely burn your face before it has actually touched your mouth. Kinda like burned from being close to you. 

Assuming you did it so quick that you didnt give it enough time to actualy burn. split second so to speak. 

I would assume that you would feel Immediate pain, and then your nerve endings yould burn away before you even realized you got burnt. But see the human flesh is .... flesh so it will burn off immediately 

Part of your mouth would have no nerve endings anymore but some parts will. 10/10 guaranteed its the worst pain you will ever imagine and you will passout or the lava will burn a whole out of the bottom of your mouth or blisters will form immediately but the water in those blisters will boil and then burn you more and choke you to death but youll be dead before you even get to this point so its mute.....

* They hype up how much ""exposure"" you'll get, or supposed future advancement opportunities. That means ""this job sucks, but at least it's adjacent to some that don't suck so much!""

* On the other hand, if they offer a suspiciously large bonus for staying X years for X &gt; 2, that means the vast majority of employees aren't going to make it to X years. For example, Amazon reportedly offers employees stock grants that vest over 4 years on a 5%-15%-40%-40% schedule. According to other reports, the vast majority of Amazon employees don't last 2 years, much less the 3 it takes to get that 40%.

But anything for &gt;2 years that's disproportionately bigger than the 1st year bonus should be viewed with extreme suspicion.)

* ""Work hard, play hard."" Usually this means two things: The ""work hard"" part will mean lots of unpaid overtime if it's a salaried position.

* Vague job descriptions, or even worse, ""you'll wear many hats"". This usually means they expect you to do everything under the sun. You'll be subject to your boss's every whim as well as your boss's boss's and all the way up.

* They push really hard to make you name a concrete number for your expected pay, without giving their own number first. That usually means they're trying to lowball you.

* They want you to work for a ""probationary"" period before hiring you on as a full employee. Usually that means they're just going to use you for some cheap labor, and you'll be laid off quickly to make room for the next batch of ""probationary"" new hires as soon as you become more expensive to keep around.

"Tenant I evicted, after a protracted and complicated series of magistrate cpurt hearings, didn't show up to the last one. Magistrate, as he had all along, found in our favor and allowed us to schedule a constable to put this tenant out the following Monday. This, after 180+ days of aggravation, non payment, threats, damages, police visits to this tenant's unit due to violence on his part, etc. we were like, finally! All our troubles are over now.

We leave the hearing, post the notice on the door, next to all the other notices already up there, and leave for the weekend. On Monday, constable arrives and lets us know he's going over to the unit, and we follow him over. He pounds on the door, makes a phone call, no answer. He uses the keys to enter the unit and he finds the tenant passed out (we thought), on the carpet inside the hallway near one of the back bedrooms. 

He had vomited, defecated and urinated all over himself and everything around him. We tried to rouse him, with no luck.

Turns out, he died from a drug overdose. The stench was awful. Writing this down, 20 years later, I feel that same sour, bitter taste in my mouth that turned my stomach back then. It was the smell of an overflowing porta potty, rotten pumpkin and bad meat mixed with soured, clumpy milk, and there was a tangy, bitter, metal taste, a too-sweet sweetness that felt like it glommed onto your gums and swelled your tongue to such monstrous proportions that you couldn't fit it back in your mouth. I threw up outside, in the bushes, then called 911. 

The constable had, he said, seen worse. He took some chew out of the tin in his back pocket, and went to town on it. First time he spat, I heaved again, and had to leave. I didn't throw up again that day, but do still get queasy whenever I see or smell people doing that.

Once we were allowed back in, we discovered that the carpet and walls were covered with vast quantities of blood (animal, of some kind), and human excrement (likely his own). He had poured bleach, dye and paint all over the walls and floors; had torn the carpet out in huge chunks, kicked and punched several large, jagged holes in the drywall, yanked the light fixtures out of the ceilings and walls, and poured concrete down the sinks and toilets. 

He had carted in a bunch of power tools, too and the police thought maybe he had other plans for those. That maybe he wasn't quite finished with his revenge when he took a break to get wasted, and suddenly and unexpectedly died.

We had to use a special biohazard cleaning service to get that unit cleaned up, and had to go back to court to get his family (former room mates and the current co signers on the lease), to pay for some of the damage. We let them slide on the back rent and dropped the criminal complaints against them for their participation in some of the fiascoes which led up to our evicting this tenant, but did try to get something for the costs we incurred for the cleanup. We never got a dime but thankfully, never saw any of them again."

Enough so that she lives a very lavish lifestyle with her husband and 2 children. She was beautiful and sought after in highschool and even more so now. She was the picture of entitlement then and a raging bitch when i knew her well and most people pretty much just liked her because she was known for throwing fits if she didn't get all the attention and tolerated it because of the popularity that came with associating with her. I've heard from various people, (mutual friends, photographers, makeup and hair artists, ect.) that she is even worse now. People have even refused to work with her because of her reputation. I don't like to think of myself as someone who wishes ill will on anyone, but I'd be lying if I said it won't make me feel a little warm and fuzzy inside when her terrible attitude and entitlement ruins the good thing she has going right now.

"It's the power and the complexity of love, how my family can drive me to distraction with their failings and imperfections but I'd drop everything and go to them if they asked me. The reason? A million tiny things that happened over a lifetime.  

Take a small example: when I was like 8 years old. My mom used to warm up the cereal milk because she worried we'd catch colds living in a house we couldn't afford to heat up. I remember eating a LOT of lentils that my dad swore up and down were completely different dishes.We were too poor for much else. 

Looking back now, the tenderness of mom warming the milk and dad making up different names and origin stories for the same lentil stew makes me ache inside. I remember my mom attending the Christmas carol service at my school even though she wasn't totally fluent in the language and had no idea what was going... but she wanted to be there for me.  

These things hit so hard now; I had such a lovely childhood and I was so oblivious to the effort my parents put into it. I never considered what discomforts and hardships they endured so that we would never feel it. It was only a year or two ago I spotted on a Reddit thread somebody saying they knew they were poor because their parents always ate after the kids and if the food was all gone the parents would say they weren't hungry. I realized that my dad did this for years. It took me this long, literal decades, to realize.  
Sometimes an act of love can echo through decades and still arrive like a sucker punch.  

When I was younger I found it took effort to find things to be grateful for and now I'm getting older I can barely keep up with how much I have to give thanks for. I find that it's so much easier to be kind and polite and understanding. There are very few hills worth dying on but one of them is love in all its forms: for your parents, siblings, spouse, kids, friends, colleagues.

"A guy pulled the fake medical emergency at a company I worked at before.

I don't remember all of the details but it kept getting more elaborate (I think he had to go visit his sick father after getting out of the hospital), after a few weeks my boss got suspicious and started snooping and found out he'd done the same thing at a previous job.

"The speech Marc Antony said during Julius Caesar. Our state makes all 10th graders memorize it.

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;

I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.

The evil that men do lives after them;

The good is oft interred with their bones;

So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus

Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:

If it were so, it was a grievous fault,

And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.

Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest–

For Brutus is an honourable man;

So are they all, all honourable men–

Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.

He was my friend, faithful and just to me:

But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honourable man.

He hath brought many captives home to Rome

Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:

Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:

Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honourable man.

You all did see that on the Lupercal

I thrice presented him a kingly crown,

Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

And, sure, he is an honourable man.

I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,

But here I am to speak what I do know.

You all did love him once, not without cause:

What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?

O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;

My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,

And I must pause till it come back to me.

"I think (educated guess based on reading) it is very hard because it is rigged by the insurance parties so everything is incredibly expensive. Of course no universal healthcare system would survive with the prices as they are, it is insane, but because prices are artificially inflated and there is also a strong cultural bias maybe.

I understand why some would be skeptical if the state goes and starts taking your money on beforehand. But there is a reason and it is solidarity. Yes, you might not need it or not, but if you do, you are not left on your own.

We think it is right that we put a bit of money to build a highway that you maybe don't use, but somehow putting money so that no one dies because of not having money, or not having to face an excruciating debt for the rest of your lives, seems to be out of our minds? This is what I don't understand, honestly.

Sure you can have options. Here (Spain) for example we have a pretty awesome healthcare system. It has their flaws of course and it can be improved, but I know I am covered, I know my jobless familiars are covered too. And I am glad to put a part of my taxes to help with that, even if I don't need it right now. I gladly let that money go out of my wallet before being in my hands, knowing that it might help people that needs it.

I have a workmate that developed cancer recently. He's been out of work for 4 months, in chemo right now. He is getting 100% of his salary and everything is paid by the healthcare system. I don't want to imagine if this scene was in the US and had to go through negotiations and whatnot with insurance, not even talking about companies.

What do we want a society for if we don't agree to build an umbrella to protect us? And before someone mentions that some people don't deserve or deserve less, i'd rather let someone that don't deserves it to get the medical care anyways than even having to answer that nasty question.

"The transistor changed the course of human history more than fire? Than language? Than writing? Than agriculture? I feel like most of the answers you had to scroll past are just *obviously* more ""course changing"". 

Heck, they're all *prerequisites* for inventing the transistor. Even if you think that, hypothetically, hunter-gatherers without language could have eventually invented transistors... they wouldn't have had much to do with them. And direct prerequisites like quantum mechanics seem like they obviously subsume everything that transistors have accomplished. "
"For St. Louis, you gotta know where your at, one block over could be the literal definition of hell itself and then look back the other way, it could be the most fun and friendly neighborhood in the whole Damn city. like Ferguson has some really nice houses and neighborhoods in it but go to far down West Florissant and might not come back alive. I grew up in North St. Louis and to make it simple; be on your toes when in the city, if you never been to St. Louis before please find a friend or someone that knows the city so you can get the best from it and stay safe, stay away from bad areas areas and don't even think about going to them, Do not go out at night when staying downtown, walk with a crowd and NEVER walk alone downtown, and we are SUPER friendly and will always try to help people that don't know the area.

"That's a good point, but this is one of those things where people will completely change without warning. Like, they could lived an entire life behaving as though they are honestly good, and everyone they encounter would testify that they were. Until that one thing changes: once they have access to power, the reality comes out. You just never really know until you're in that situation how you'll react. If they never gained the money/power/etc, they'd have remained that honestly good person their entire life, perhaps.

"When I was in 8th grade there was a kid that would do this constantly. The desk would shake sometimes too. The teacher finally caught him and told him to stop. Caught him again and then he was suspended. When he came back from suspension, he went around telling people he was going to slit our teacher's throats, so several people told our teachers. Teachers confronted him and found two knives on him. He was expelled after that. A few days after he was expelled he vandalized our playground not realizing there were cameras everywhere. No idea what happened after they caught him doing that."

"A student suffered a stroke and went into cardiac arrest before the ambulance could get to the school on time. It was terrifying for everyone involved to see his body convulse and twitch violently. The teachers tried to block line of sight from everyone else and I believe one of them tried to revive the student after the student stopped moving. 

When news came out that he had died on that day the whole school felt like it was in a trance. People looked visibly upset while others held lifeless expressions in an attempt to build a wall against the waves of emotions wanting to crash out into the open. The dream-like state of the school continued for about a week or two with no one really talking or paying attention to class and sometimes the teachers just gave out busy work to do instead of teaching. 

It felt so surreal being at school and seeing everyone operate like robots, going through the motions without understanding or attention. "

"I hate to do the thing where I wasn't a teacher, but what happened at my high school was kind of unprecedented. This is a nice public school in a well-to-do touristy area. Over the course of my four years there, about a dozen students died of various things.

The first was a just-graduated senior who was drunk driving and wrapped his car around a tree.

Then a kid died of alcohol poisoning at a party.

Then a kid got into a car accident on the way to school.

Then a kid committed suicide.

Then a kid who was biking to school got hit by a car.

Then a kid overdosed.

Then a thirteen year-old girl was peer pressured into taking her older cool kids friends on a joy ride, got into an accident, and everyone but her died. It was awful. She got harassed and school and death threats. Her parents gave her up to the state.

Then a kid drowned.

Then another car accident. 16 is really too young to be getting a license, I think.

Anyways, I didn't know any of these kids really well, thank goodness. But what was really weird to see was the tragedy drama. After a kid died, people that barely knew them would say they were their best friend. Their lockers would become a memorial. There would be fights in front of the locker about who the best friend was. The dead kid's closest friends and/or girlfriends would become instantly popular.

The suicide was different. Every other death, the flag was flown at half-mast, but not for the suicide. A friend of mine got suspended for going out to half-mast it herself. Everyone avoided his girlfriend, and no one talked about his death. No grief counselors like there were for the others.

Anyway, I learned then, and later with deaths in my family, that death really brings out the worst in people. It's really astounding to me."

"It's a much longer story than this, but the important details are as follows:

I was dating a woman pretty seriously. She wanted to get married within the next year or so; I had always intended to wait (with anyone, not just her) until my late 20s at least. That, in itself, was not an issue.

Her dad worked for a military contractor and wanted me to work for his buddy in a DOD lab in Pennsylvania. We're from Michigan. Also not an issue in itself, although I had and have zero qualifcations or desire to work in the military.

The issue was that she was really abusive, and had repeatedly told me the details of how she would murder me and hide the body. She had an aunt who was a judge elsewhere in the state, and was confident that she even though ""they'll never find [my] body"" she would get off scott free. Sometimes it wasn't murder, sometimes it was suicide... she would tell me the full details of her suicide plan and how it would be my fault if she died. Or sometimes it was full on murder-suicide. But it was always, always my fault. Comply or one of us (or both of us) dies. There were quite a few occasions in which she actively and seriously endangered my life, and/or her own. And I was so far in over my head in believing her spin on things that I believed I would be killed unless I just let her do her thing in secret.

We broke up years ago, but I am absolutely certain that I would be dead if I had moved to Pennsylvania. If I'd taken the DOD job I would be d-e-d. She had already isolated me from my family and friends, and that added distance and lack of support network would only have made things worse.

She died earlier this year. It was suicide, unfortunately. I bear no malice against her -- I had hoped that she was doing better, and though I never wanted to see her again, she was still a human being. But I am very thankful that I dodged that bullet (or, much more likely, knife)."

"The Americans saying they can see a specialist tomorrow with no wait are full of shit.  While you sometimes can, that's not usual.  I'd say it's a week to 10 days on average.  Last summer, I called around Nashville to get an appointment with a rheumatologist.  They scheduled me with Dr. Susan Harwell for over a month later.  I cancelled the appointment since I was moving to Korea.  That being said, I've never had a six month wait.  But I don't think the USA having shorter wait times than Canada can be attributed to us not having a single-payer, universal healthcare system since Korea does and the wait times in Korea are way, way, *way* shorter than in the USA."

"No, it's not. But when kids have learning difficulties or whatever, they can do this just because it ""feels nice"". babies do it. It's not got a sexual connotation to it, they don't know any different. I don't know how old this girl was, but if she was young, elementary school young, she probably didnt know any difference and did it because it felt nice. usually if kids are known to do this, the parents should tell them that its no appropriate and to not do it in public, then change the subject and get them to do something productive."

I think the one who was most upset was the poor 7th grader whose family were conservative catholic and who had been taught it was a sin. An older student sat her down and explained to her that Leviticus was a long way into the Bible and that there's a lot before that about loving thy neighbor, accepting those who are different and even if it was a sin, God is loving and forgiving and perhaps it wasn't such an issue. Was actually very gentle about it. "

"Well I guess this story is ight for this.

She was a Junior when I was a freshman, and I *really* liked her. Noticed we'd lock eyes in the hallway, and she'd keep looking. Gorgeous fucking girl, at the time I thought I was in love.

I finally started talking to her, right after she broke up with her boyfriend, and she dropped off the soccer team, so I got her number, fast forward a few months, and we're good *friends*. Eventually the next year she asks me to her senior prom, we go, have a great time, and even better for me back then, she was the first girl I fucked. She goes to college in a different state, I grow up, find a new crowd, essentially forget about her, casual teenager shit.

I didn't talk to her for years. Totally lost contact. 2 years after I graduate, she texts me, says she misses me. I ask how she's doing and she says not well.

Turns out in the span of 4 years, she had an abusive boyfriend who got her to drop out, and she tried hard drugs, and... schizophrenia hit hard. 

She began messaging me a lot. She came back in-state for some reason, and would go to the same bars as me. One day my parents found a letter from her in their mailbox. Hand delivered.

I didn't know what to do, and my girlfriend at the time began receiving really weird texts, and so I asked her to please stop stalking me. I regret it, I should've been nicer. I'd get calls from her every so often, up to this past January. Never picked up.

She killed herself a few months ago. Hung. Insane how the girl I knew like 6 or 7 years ago was totally normal, had a ton of great friends, and then just like flipping a switch, hit rock bottom.

Sorry for this mood killer, but I haven't really talked about it much. I might be downplaying how great of a friend she was, but it's crazy knowing she was the same person I last saw a year ago. She looked *nothing* alike from her old self. Really crazy what mental illness can do."

"A friend of mine in high school loved that song and was having a bad day one time. I just happened to have the version from the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack on my iPod, so I gave it to her for her to listen to to try and make her feel better. I'd never actually listened to the song myself so I didn't know how it went, but after a few minutes she just started crying and wouldn't stop. Apparently she'd only ever heard the chorus and not the rest of the song before...whoops."

If the world is unfair and some people just get all the resources through random chance there is a legitimate expectation that they, understanding that all human life is valuable, share some of those resources.

Instead we get the ideology that *if you don't get, you don't deserve*. This comes under various forms such as the FAE, the just world delusion etc."

This is exactly why stranger danger is a ridiculous thing to teach children.

"I was on a date with my boyfriend, we'd been ""official"" for a week, dating a little over a month.  

We'd just gone to the zoo and were leaving, and on the way to the car I had a couple painful stomach cramps, but nothing too serious.  I didn't think anything of it right then.  We got in the car, me driving, and decided we wanted to hit up a fro yo place on the other side of town.  I felt like I needed to poo, but it was nothing special, thought I could hold it until we got there.  Then about halfway there, as I pulled up to a red light, I was overcome by an unprecedented stomach cramp and my body completely betrayed me.  My bowels let loose there in the driver seat, no control, not an ounce of willpower to clench the floodgates shut, right next to my boyfriend.  He thought I'd just farted.  I laughed it off and pretended like I had.  Rolled down the window, did NOT roll it back up.

I thought when we got to the fro yo place (at an outdoor mall) I could just use the bathroom and ditch my undies.  Unfortunately, the stomach cramps persisted.  I told my boyfriend I was in desperate need of a bathroom when we arrived at the mall and we began looking for a restroom.  We found one, and I felt so relieved because I could feel another cramp coming on as we neared the doors.

The bathroom, a large men's restroom, was closed.  Doors locked.  

As we turned away from the locked bathroom I shit myself even worse than before.  I didn't even miss a step in my walk, it happened so fast.  I still didn't want to admit to my bf what was happening to me, so very casually we headed toward the indoor food court to use the restrooms there instead, me fighting to pretend like everything's cool while shuffling as carefully as I could to not spill the bag of diarrhea jostling in my trousers.  I was also wearing shorts and was praying I didn't have it running down my leg (I KNEW I CHOSE BOXER BRIEFS FOR A REASON, OMG).

We finally found an open bathroom and I spent the next twenty minutes in a stall doing my damnedest to clean myself up.  I told my boyfriend that it was a ""little worse"" than I let on.  

We're still dating a year later and I only told him the whole story about a month ago."

"Fuck that. Me and my wife explored all over Jamaica on our own.

""Yeah, I heard it was good, but I never took the class. [other friend] gave those to me.""

""What are you talking about? You totally took that class - that's how I know you! You sat across from me!""

They swore up and down that they'd never taken that class. I was so confused that I actually looked at my transcript to see if maybe I had another class in that room, or if I had audited something, but nope. So I have no idea where that memory comes from (or where I actually met this person)."

I will concede that the city is not exactly a hidden gem (several manufacturing plants closed/housing crash/drug epidemic hit the city pretty hard), but if you come into the city to do something, it's safe to assume that you'll be just fine. It has problems that any city has, just in a condensed area, since we aren't a hugely populated metropolis.

**EDIT: If you would like more information on teaching in China (and the differences in Korea and Japan) please read my comment [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6p7kik/what_is_the_shittiest_city_youve_visited_only/dko02wq/)**

Honking is only used for letting others you're there. It's constant honking 24/7. Turn signals are optional, stop lights are optional, and if you run over someone 99% of people drive away. 

A friend of mine who is a teacher too has also dealt with some of the worst management. Managers love to micromanage the fuck out of you. If you refuse a ""suggestion"" they also get so passive aggressive without passing the line into harassment. For example, the bell was about to ring and he had to go to class quickly. The manager would move in front of him while passing in the hallway to slow him to make him almost late. It doesn't sound like a lot, but imagine this in every instance. 

Another thing is that, that decivieng and lying isn't really seen as immoral here. They want to say yes to please you instead of saying no. Another thing (that isn't really the Chinese's fault) is that the government has instilled this mentality that any critic on China's government is a reflection on themsleves. Another friend of mine insinuated that voting is a good thing, and was reported by 3 students. They don't see Cheating as morally wrong either.


A lot of students idolize English teachers because of Hollywood. They get very, very upset if they think you are insulting them or dislike them. A lot of students live in poverty and then moved to a big city for education (Beijing is about 50% of people who were born there).. For them to see successful (the salary for the English teacher immediately puts you in middle/upper middle class in China) people makes them look up to you especially if you are white. 

Students also have dreams that could be considered ""stupid"" in the US. Because of the poverty most were born in, they usually want to use English as a way to expand their business in factories or something along those lines.. While in the US a lot of people want to be actors, singers,  dancers, sport players when they are young. Since small business only began recently after the death of Mao, a lot of businesses haven't formed good ethics and skirt around the line of ethical practices. 

Another thing is that in China dating is used solely for marriage, instead of casual fun and ""see where it goes"". 

English teachers also tend to be 50% of people running from their problems, 30% wanting to be ""top of the food chains"" and 20% good teachers. I've had people ask to take pictures with me and either outright adore me or hate me because I'm a white female. Chinese men generally don't like white men for stealing ""their women"". Teachers aren't that appreciated and most end up bitter expats after a few years because of management. You don't want to challenge the students too much. You are generally an etertainer first, a white person second (of this applies) and a teacher 3rd.

Also, you should never ever lose face or make someone lose face. I've seen people blow up (at management) and some of those relationships will just never be repaired. And believe me, you WILL eventually blow up because of this. I've seen other English teachers get a ""deer in bealdlights"" on the first few days in China because they have no clue WTF is going on. Lol, it's ridiculously funny and I empathize with them. 


I deeply, deeply love China. It has a lot of positives and some of the most amazing people. A lot of this stuff isn't ""bad"" but very, very different from what I'm used to. Sorry for the big rant, but it's something that is pretty unique to their culture, and more specially the bigger citites (Beijing notably). This is my generalizations and things I've noticed from living in China.

My friend, at my request, snuck into the office (in broad daylight), and took it for me. As well as everyone else's phones that they were keeping in there. He gave them all back (by sneaking them into lockers and book bags, so that nobody could know he did it, but he gave me mine directly because I wasn't a snitch), and nobody in the school's staff ever knew how it happened.

"I see your anecdote with my anecdote; did mdma 3-4 nights a week in large doses (taking more as the night goes on) and partied myself into poverty. Was 19-20 and this went on for 9 months or so. Kind of happened after I moved back home upon finishing my first year of college and learning that my parents were getting a divorce.  Up until that point I was raised in a middle class home, was a great student in school, had many friends and activities, etc. 
Anyway one day I Realized I didnt want to keep living in a shit apartment, that I wanted to make something of myself, that I wanted to make my friends and family *proud* of me, and my life was fun, but was going nowhere. 

So I made a new Facebook account with my real name instead of my ""rave name"" and moved 3 hours away with only $900, a car full of stuff, and my 18 year old girlfriend. We were kids and just thinking back to that really makes me wonder what the hell we were doing.

Now I'm 26, I'm responsible, I'm happy and positive about life, and I generally feel well versed in dealing with my own emotions. MDMA allowed me to work through childhood trauma (molested by cousin, member of the Mormon church until I was 16 - learning your entire basis for reality isn't true and losing the friends and community at the same time was tough) and my parents divorce in a way that makes sense and I am ok with. I'm at peace now. I founded a company whose mission is to improve people's confidence, we employ 10 people now, and we are on track to do over 1 million in revenue this year! 

For every guy who did drugs and got ""messed up"", there are just as many stories of people who use MDMA recreationally and often who don't deal with the ""holes in the brain"" some people do. I suspect those who get into heavy drug us with MDMA don't do so responsibly (even when I was young I always tested my drugs and stayed hydrated in addition to taking supplements to help with serotonin) and likely weren't on a great path anyway. 

I recommend every person do MDMA a few times in their life. With friends, with loved ones, and even alone. I really wish that drug laws weren't so archaic; MDMA should be used as a tool in therapy and so long as you are staying hydrated and taking appropriate doses, there's not a lot to worry about in terms of lasting side effects.

"I learned a long time ago that ""common sense"" is pretty much a bullshit term, at least how it's used, and anyone who disparages the lack of it are either self-aggrandizing themselves for having it, or bemoaning other people for not agreeing with them. OP is clearly the former, calling it a ""super power"".

Here's an example of what I mean. I watched a video or something of an anti-evolutionist dismissing evolution because it, or a part of it, defied common sense. Now, evolution is not a common experience. We don't experience evolution in our day to day lives, or, in fact, ever in our lives, unless we're breeders or scientists I guess. It takes place over thousands of generations. So common sense doesn't apply, does it?

But that's how most people use it, to reinforce their beliefs. Including OP and the 2000 people who upvoted them. Most of whom probably disagree with a good chunk, if not a majority, of the other people on what is or isn't common sense. Which, like I said, makes the term pretty meaningless."

"I've actually been thinking I'm going to take some time out of Reddit, as it's starting to feel a little bit toxic. I think it's predominantly American, white, 16-30 year old men who use it the most, who get very defensive when you mention racism, sexism, or anything like that. Admittedly I'm only really active on AskReddit so I don't know what the rest of the site is like.

Plus, the American prudishness is exhausting. Maybe not just American, but non-European, I guess. There was one AskReddit thread that was something like 'when was the first time you saw a member of the opposite sex for the first time?' and the vast majority of people were saying 'I was 16 ...' and I was thinking, hang on, what about seeing your parents wander around in the bathroom when you're a kid? Or, I dunno, when you go to the beach? That's a light example, the worst is when I might mention hooking up with men if it's part of a discussion (as a single, mid-twenties female, yep, it happens) and get called a 'whore' or that 'your dad must be so proud' - these are just not sentiments I see outside of the internet.

"I have a beagle. Beagles, God love them, are not very smart. He is the third beagle I've owned. 

My poor baby has the intelligence level of a wet sock. He's afraid of most common household items- baskets, hardwood floors, stairs, the recliner. 

He does not understand that No, you cannot walk through me. This poor creature will walk through a doorway with you, and be confused as to why he can't walk through you. 

When I let him outside, it take a full 10 seconds for him to realize that yes, the door is open.

He has ran into the sliding glass door too many times for comfort. Windows and mirrors also confuse him. 

Theres a comic online from Hyperbole and a Half about the dumb dog test. It includes putting a blanket over the dog to see if it will escape, testing of he's actually responding to his name, or just words, and a game involving putting a treat under a cup. 

I put the blanket over his head. He became confused, and laid down to accept his fate of being in the dark. It took 5 minutes for him to get out of the blanket. 

He will respond to most English words when called. Of those include: asshole, futon, cheese, and bub. 

The treat under the cup confused him. He knew there was food under it, but couldn't figure out how to knock over the cup to get the treat. He ended up laying down and whining until I revealed the treat.

Y'all, he's the sweetest dog I've ever owned. I'm pretty positive he's a failed hunting dog, because he's caught birds from midair, and ""trees"" bugs in our house. He enjoys sleeping in his ""nest"" on my futon, being held like a baby, and belly rubs. Dislikes being wet, cold, or mildly inconvenienced in any fashion. He also hates any other dog put in his presence, until he ""meets"" the other dog. 

When he gets in trouble, he immediately lays down and exposes his belly, as if thats going to change my mind. However, that isn't often. He's peed on my floor once, and has chewed up 1 thing I've owned. When I first got him, I accidentally left a bag of Hershey kisses on the floor. He was alone in my room for 6 hours. Did not touch the chocolate. 

He's a good boy. I remind him every day. Not the smartest boy- but a good boy. "

This was a dope exchange.
"In all Star Wars movies, the film does not have any openning credits, just ""A Long Time Ago in Galaxy Far, Far away..."" before going to the crawl and then the film. 

This tradition completely altered the plan for Star Wars forever and indirectly led to George Lucas' divorce and the creation of Pixar as we know it.

Back in the 70's/80's, the Director Guild of America required that films using guild directors put the director's name before the film started. They didn't mind that this was omitted from *Star Wars* (now known as ""*Star Wars: A New Hope*"") but were pissed that it was omitted from *Empire Strikes Back*. They fined the director and even pushed to get the film pulled from theaters. George cut all ties with the guild after the stunt, but that left him with a huge problem. He wanted to spend more time with his wife and focus on building Lucasfilm ranch (which was meant to be a Hollywood for independents), and wanted to be able to hand off the planned Star Wars sequels/prequels (which were meant to be released much, MUCH earlier than they did) to competent directors. Steven Spielberg was his first choice to direct Return of the Jedi, but legally couldn't because Steven was a Director guild member. So, George had to find a non-guild director, and found a guy who had only directed stuff on television. Unforuntately, this director was not up to the challenge and George Lucas ended up micromanging the film and production as a whole, rather than stepping back.

This extended absence put the final nail in George Lucas' marriage to Marcia Lucas. They got a divorce right after Return of the Jedi hit theaters... which came with another problem. Marcia had given up on Geogre's plans for Lucasfilm and the ranch, but she still owned half the company. George had to spend most of his money to buy out her share, lest she sell her portion off to a big studio.

George was beyond depressed, and Lucasfilm was low on funds after the buyout. The plans for Star Wars prequels/sequels was put on hold indefiently, and the computer division of the company, Pixar, was sold off to Steve Jobs to keep the rest of Lucasfilm afloat. Lucasfilm itself could not afford to be the Hollywood of independents as Lucas dreamed.

All because ""Directed by Irvin Kershner"" did not appear before the film."

"Here's the deal. 

When I was a little kid, my sisters and I were playing in the house. The heating units for the house ran along the bottoms of the walls, just above the moulding where the wall meets the floor. [Like this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uz6gBVdhQUs/TdrowXn8TWI/AAAAAAAAAHk/u5dKzAT5Y9s/s1600/baseboard-and-laminate.JPG). My youngest sister, 4 years old, was very accident prone and she took a spill and hit her face just above the eye on the corner of the heating unit. It split her eyebrow open and she starts screaming as the blood pours. My mother scoops us all up into the car and drives as fast as she can to the nearest hospital. 

Then we hit a dead-stop traffic jam. It's bad. Like L.A. on the 405 at 5pm on a holiday weekend bad. My sister is screaming and bleeding, my other sister is crying, my mom is crying and I'm freaked out trying to keep everyone calm. We are waiting for what seems like hours but probably 15 minutes, still an insanely long amount of time considering. 

Then my sister starts to lose consciousness. At that point my mother makes the right call and pulls to the right and starts passing cars driving on the shoulder. We're moving along until some *DICKhead* sees us coming and vigilant-ily pulls over to block us because he's in charge of all the rules. 

We can't pass, my mother is screaming and cussing, my sister is fading, my other sister is crying and I begin to feel a rage I'd never felt in my life and probably still haven't felt to this day. I can still remember how furious I was right now as I type this, it's funny. 

Finally the guy moves after probably a full minute of my mom laying on the horn and we pass and make it to the hospital where my sister gets 4 stitches. 

Point is, you don't know what's going on in the bubble of someone else's life and it is irrelevant to you. Sure, 90% of the people who drive on the shoulder are most likely self-important, impatient people. But who cares. It doesn't effect you and you aren't the police. Let them get pulled over. Or let them get to the fucking hospital. "

They always respond with, ""I'm not driving, I'm traveling!"" But Florida, in the same chapter, DEFINES driving as, ""to operate or be in actual physical control of a motor vehicle in any place open to the general public for purposes of vehicular traffic.""

Just because you don't agree with the definition doesn't mean it doesn't apply...It's pretty clear cut what is meant by 'driving' without a license."

Not to mention constant on the job drinking if there's easily accessible alcohol to steal (for example a saki machine which you can easily do a saki drive by and make yourself a couple good saki and sprites to get through the shift). Also in my experience people in restaurants get off work and often go straight to the bar and start drinking."

For you that don't know the public right of way usually ends 12-15 ft from the back of curb, and is owned by the city.  This guy doesn't mow the section of grass between the curb and sidewalk because he says it's the city's and it's our responsibility.  We get complaints on it and go mow it a couple times and charge him.

When it's about to go on his taxes he shows up to Council and has an even crazier friend talk for him while he live streams the meeting that is already being lived streamed.  His friend states making him mow that section of lawn is indentured servitude, and asked if a property abuts city hall can the city make the owners come in and scrub toilets?  Never mind the fact that this guy has two sections of right of way and mows one but not the other, and we've told him this repeatedly.  He signed his objection with a smiley face.

Afterwards we google him and he and his crazier friend have a history of moving into properties and racking up utility fees and other fees that get assessed back to the property and don't follow the user.  They leave and the new owner or landlord is stuck with them.

The more rational people there only finally convinced them to stop when they learned that I was, in fact, an actual 12-year-old child and that they had just spent an hour insulting a kid for fun.

Before it ended, and after I ""provoked"" them by defending myself, they even went so far as to stalk down my profiles online and make some very rude comments about my family too. Scared the ever-loving shit out of me because I'd heard horror stories and thought that they were going to leak my address, or something.

The only good thing I got out of that website is a really practical lesson of cyber-security and keeping your accounts locked down and unconnected to anything important.

I don't understand this culture where we want people to suffer because it's shameful to ask for help. It shouldn't be shameful. Sometimes people need help. If parents are willing, why not take the help that is offered?

"Oh man, here we go.

So when I was 17, I was staying at a hotel in the Poconos with my family. Being your standard edgy teen, family time wasn't for me so I spend much of the first night on a computer that was set up near the bar where guests can use the internet (this was before smartphones were ubiquitous). So there I am, browsing anime message boards when this beautiful woman comes out of the bar, sees me and asks where the bathroom is. I tell her, she thanks me and leaves. 

A few minutes later, I see her walking back towards the bar (the wall behind the computer was basically a huge mirror) and I could have sworn that she winked at me just as she turned the corner down the hall that leads to the bar. Being a horny and awkward teen, my first instinct was to get uo and follow her... with no idea what to say or do, I was pretty much being dragged by my dick. She notices me turn the corner, slyly asks ""are you following me?"" to which I responded something along the lines of ""uhh, nah... just, uhh, going up to my room."" She keeps waking for a second, turns around and notices me checking out her ass (short skirt, great ass). ""Like what you see?"" she asks. ""Uhh yea"" I said mid chuckle like an idiot. She immediately bends over for a split second, presenting EVRYTHING just quickly enough for my mind to process it. No panties, clean shaven. I'm freaking the fuck out internally.

She stops, we chat awkwardly for a bit, she puts her arms around my neck and practically pins me against the wall. Asks how old I am, I respond honestly (then mentally kick myself) and her responds is basically ""ugh, you're so cute, but your so YOUNG."" She tells me to wait there, goes back into the back for about 15 minutes and just as I'm walking away thinking I blew my chance, she comes back out... with her boyfriend. He asks if I think she was hot, I say yes, he turns her around and lifts her skirt again: ""Give it a good spank"". I do, she giggles, he remarks how confidently I did it and asks if I want to go up to their room to ""watch us bang"". 

We get up there, I'm sweating bullets while they tease me about it as they start fooling around and undressing. They start having sex while I watch on the chair next to them and the following statements/suggestions were made by them, which I agree to, in order:

""Don't be afraid to touch yourself""
""Why don't you take your pants off?""
""Come closer (pats the edgeof the bed)""
""Want my mouth?"" (Her) 
""Lay down, dude, get more comfortable"" (him)
""You ever been touched by a dude/wanna try?"" (Her)
""Sweet, I'm gonna help her out. Cool?"" ""Him

And after a double blowjob from a male/female couple while they fucked, I realized that I was bi. Still can't believe it sometimes, myself. That shit was straight out of porn...

eta: i'm pretty sure they hired me and my sister to act as the scapegoats for every issue the library was facing so they could save their own jobs. about two or three years ago a new city manager decided to personally audit every aspect of his city, when he met the ladies in charge of that library and the library systems for the city he immediately fired them both.

at a different job, it was incredibly slow on like a monday or tuesday or something. our expo was in college too and needed some time to study for a test, since it was insanely slow he spoke with the floor manager, who said he could leave if everyone in the kitchen was okay with it. we were all cool with it, so he left. then it got a little busy, but literally nothing we couldn't handle. next day he calls me and says he got fired, the floor manager lied to our head chef and said he just walked out on the job without talking to him right as it got busy. that guy still works at that restaurant as a floor manager, never worked his way up the ladder, the head chef is off somewhere else but i don't give a shit because she was a terrible human being."

"Well, yeah, but that's just the *beginning*. Joy does redeem herself.

Joy thinks she's clearly the most important, is terrified of change and has caused the repression of other valuable emotions. This leads to a huge crisis when Riley's life changes and the other emotions are needed.

Joy learns that Sadness and the other other emotions have key roles in personal growth. She is taught the hard way that her brand of perfectionism can be really dangerous. 

Joy cries like every parent who misses the child they once knew and who fears what the world will do to the teenager they now have...but she ultimately accepts that she is part of a team. 

That's the key thing: *Joy* literally *cries*, and, after Riley's imaginary childhood friend sacrifices himself to save her, she realizes she was wrong, genuinely apologizes, and changes her behavior. Riley is saved. 

 That's a hell of an arc.

During that particular episode he refuted that I was in the turning lane to make a left hand turn (as I was repeatedly telling him) and quietly decided to try and force us to drive straight into the opposite turning lane instead of making a lane change into oncoming traffic.

As I suffer cataplexy aggravated by PTSD (specifically with respect to his frequent psychotic episodes). My only recourse was to stop the vehicle and growl at him to get the fuck out of the car while stopped in the intersection.

Even though the other passenger supported my explanation of events, his running around crying to people ""He tried to kill us making an lane change into oncoming cars!"" meant that he passenger got cowed by threats of perjury and libel charges, and I screamed at when the police responded to the passenger's call for help.

---
Yes, there were other more WTF driving moments; including the time I turned my friend's station wagon into the path of another car. The other car was racing w/ out a licence to cut us off in the left lane, when he needed to take the empty right lane to get home, and had to leave the empty middle lane to meet me. To that driver's credit he immediately called 911 on himself, and panicked when he misread the spilled blood from my ongoing nosebleed (from ""dad"" punching me as normal) as a more severe injury from his plowing into the side of my friend's car without braking. 

But TBH those incidents don't register as a WTF compared to when I've been coerced into driving family( [ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6q0am0/whats_your_biggest_wtf_moment_while_driving/dktthxh/ ""often because they got shitfaced and expected me to drive when they saw earlier I was already unable to stand under my own power for basic want of sleep {because ''dad'' insisted that I could}""), or shoved ""dad"" into the car unannounced because they didn't want to deal with his shit [ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6q0am0/whats_your_biggest_wtf_moment_while_driving/dktthxh/ ""and knew that the police would ''arrest'' me when I tried to refuse"").

edit: The family did eventually apologise for trying to force me to drive when I was unable to stand up since accepting a promise made by someone else in my name (so they can get drunk off their faces) was blatantly wrong.

Finally, our general manager fired him for poor job performance, and on that day another employee came in to report she had been a victim of identity theft and the police tracked the IP address used in the scam to that little snot's address. He was arrested for that offense but in the meantime, over a dozen of our customers reported their identities had been stolen, also.

Well, first thing is if the news articles used your 'proper' birth certificate name go with the shorter version on your resume. Turn Christopher to Chris as an example.
Next step is to make a huge presence on all social media under that shortened name. AND BE ACTIVE. Google loves recent content. As the news articles age, your pages should get bumped. Twitter, any blogs. Make a professional Linkedin profile. Etc.

I actually google random peoples names now and see what their #1 result is. If possible, I make a profile on that site as well. I have poker site profiles for example, I don't even really play.

I have a chronic, hereditary illness that no cure currently exists for, and insulin therapy gets more expensive every year. Both of my parents have been in failed relationships and are struggling with the ones they're in currently, and they're not particularly healthy, and my dad's broke and miserable because his second ex-wife broke his heart and robbed him blind when she was done with him.

"Former substitute here. One time, I had a choir class full of sixth graders. A kid comes in looking pretty unhappy, but I don't think anything of it (middle schoolers can be somewhat moody in general) and begin taking roll as soon as the bell rings.

Anyway, a group of girls is in a corner giggling about random stuff as girls do, and very suddenly the unhappy guy turns red and goes ballistic, screaming at them about how everyone is making fun of him and no one knows how tough it is, but not really making much sense with how he says it.

So I try to calm him down, try to get him to go into the choir director's office to cool down, or something. Instead, he starts rage crying, shouts some more, grabs his backpack, and stomps outta the room. He goes down a nearby stairway to the gymnasium, and barricades himself in the boys' restroom. I try to talk to him, some other kids try to talk to him, but nothing doing. Another kid gives me the angry guy's name, so I call the office, who send an over assistant principal and policeman (!!) to talk him down.

Apparently the poor kid had been razzed in the hallway just before class. Once he got to class, he saw laughter that he thought was directed at him, felt like the entire world was out to get him, and hit his limit. His outburst rattled everyone in that choir room, and I knew he probably felt embarrassed with how he handled it. "

"I asked my friend this because you didn't really seem to be getting answers from real teachers and I found the question interesting.  She is the most passionte teacher I know and I've never met anyone that loves their job more.  Here is her response.

&gt;I think one of the biggest differences is caused by what lies ahead of them and their reactions to it. 

&gt;1997 kids grew up in a time of relative peace and then their worlds were turned upside down by 9/11. Even so, they still believed in a limitless future, and college was still almost affordable. 

&gt;2007 kids never knew a time when we weren't at war or our daily lives weren't being influenced by the aftermath of 9/11. They became almost blasé in their acceptance of infringements on personal liberties in the name of national security. But they still were optimistic and full of faith that things would be ok. 

&gt;By 2017, especially following that shit election, for many of them, a self-determined future in which their diversity and individuality would be seen as an asset became a bit more difficult to have faith in. And they are more cynical and realistic about the massive debt that, for far too many of them, will go along with their acquisition of higher learning. But still, they are resilient and capable and decent. 

&gt;People talk shit about millennials and current teenagers (who I'm not sure have a generational label just yet). Most people who spout opinions about kids, particularly negative opinions, have no actual wealth of experience with teenagers from which to be forming that opinion. Kids are mostly the same as they've always been. (My data collection goes back to 1989, so I do have enough experience to be deemed a trustworthy source.). Kids are kids. 

&gt;The only real difference that I will say about kids today is that the parallel digital life they lead is sometimes at odds with a healthy real life. Kids have a much harder time feeling at ease with face to face human interaction and they don't always appreciate the devastating, permanent consequences some of their online actions could very well have on their lives later on. They're still dumb kids doing dumb stuff -- just like we did -- but their dumb stuff is recorded forever by their incessant posting of every single moment of their lives. Thank god we went through that before the Internet."

"Think that's sickening? There was a boy in my high school. A guy with a smile that could shine brighter than any sun. A drummer in my band. A close family friend. My sisters first kiss, my sisters first love. My sisters best friend. When the boy in my high school committed suicide, the girl-who thought she was pregnant and told the whole school she was raped by him-showed up to the funeral. I wanted to scream and cry and drag her out by her hair. She was one of his reasons. Instead I held my sister close. But even now I still feel the angry tears welling up. "

"My ex made a post about me. It was about the last time we'd seen each other. We were both at a mutual friend's 21st party about three weeks after we broke up (we'd been together for 5+ years) and I drank far too much. He thought I'd ignored him on my way to the bar, when really I just didn't notice him on the way to the bar. Post was a ""why would she do that?""

So I sent a message and we straightened things out. We're not friends but we've always been civil when we see each other from then on."

"Our prom sucked so bad because the school enforced really stupid rules. I'll give you one crucial example, they insisted that your date had to be exactly the same age. So if you are 17 and your date is 16, then it wasn't allowed.... WTF is that ***SHIT!*** It completely ruined everything, so practically nobody went and it was a complete failure. Our school's faculty had to be one of the worst ever, it's like they wanted the experience there to be bad. It was LA High."
"Passive aggressiveness like that was the reason I ended up moving out of a house I shared with two friends. One of the girls thought that any sort of conversation about a difference was confrontation. She could not talk about anything without saying she was being yelled at.

The final straw was when she moved my frozen cookie dough from the freezer to the counter because she wanted the container to be cleaned. 

Did she ask me first? No. 

Did she tell me she wanted the container to be cleaned? No. 

Did she say anything about it when I came home? No. 
She just left it on the counter, said nothing, and then before she went to bed, she put a paper towel over it. And still said nothing. 

So I went into the kitchen and asked what point she was trying to make, and she got all mad and said I was the worst roommate and I was mean to her and she shouldn't have to tell me things. And how dare I ask her to be quieter when I wake her up on Tuesdays and Thursdays even though she never said I was waking her up!? She actually ended up having this huge list of things that she didn't like about living with me that stretched back to April. And it was August. She had never said anything before that! Some of them would have been SO EASY to resolve, but she just would not communicate things. (edit: things like, please leave your shoes in the garage and not beside the entryway. Put the mail in a different spot when you bring it in.) 

I am a very open person. If something is wrong, we should talk about it and find a solution. Easy. It isn't personal, it isn't an attack, it's just what you have to do when you live with people. But she did not understand that.

"I haven't had a student die during the school year but one of my former students was shot and killed a year ago. He was about 16 and from the news report it seemed to be gang related. He was a quiet kid, I really never suspected he had gang ties. Unfortunately, it's fairly common to have deaths of this nature in the district. A lot of these kids in gangs are fun to have in class. I really try to stress to them that they're just being used by the older gang members so the kids are the ones that get killed or arrested while the shot callers get off with nothing to tie them to the crime.

I get pretty upset when people says things like ""we just need to execute every gang member and be done with it."" There's plenty of good kids in there that haven't loss their soul yet. "

"Not sure how to link from mobile, so I copied it; My grandmother was full blood Blackfoot (Native American) and was won as property in a poker game by my grandfather, who happened to be in a seat of reasonable power in an Anton Levey satanic cult. My mother was born into abuse, sexual, physical and mental, which left her fragmented into literally hundreds of personalities (which they used to their advantage by programming in other personalities with less than pleasant directives, trigger words etc). She was passed around at parties as a sex toy as a child and circulated as a sex slave. She was one of many many childre who were passed around, bought, abused etc in this ring. Through a series of rituals she was supposedly the vessel to be the key to open the gates of hell, and I am supposedly the spawn of Satan. When I was 18 months old my mother escaped with myself and my sibling and we were on the run until 2007 when we stopped getting contact."

"&gt;Nah, fuck it. When I'm a dad, I'm breaking the cycle and letting the colorful language fly.

This is what we've done with our son, He understands that we don't mind if he says any of the words except ""Fuck"" (my wife just wasn't having it) - so he can say ""Bitch, Asshole, Dickhead, Twat"" etc. and we don't care, he understands that this is a unique thing in our family, and that other families consider this kind of language to be a non-starter (especially when we live in Utah, surrounded by mormons). 

So far, we've only had trouble with the school once, when he told some kid who was bullying him to Fuck off, and the school sent home a letter with him explaining the situation which we were supposed to sign and return (To confirm we'd acknowledged the issue). I flipped the damn thing over, and wrote ""My son wouldn't have to use such strong language if that other kid wasn't such a cunt.""

His school doesn't contact me anymore, they go to my wife if they need something.


Edit: To clarify, he did get in trouble for using the ""Fuck"" word, but I wasn't too angry because he was standing up to a bully."

"It would be a version of when Obama was President except the republicans would be more aggressive in blocking every bill. Meaning another 4 years of Americans funding Congress to not do their job and going home to their million dollar taxpayer funded houses.

Today we know very clearly which big businesses are getting policies in their favour to screw over little people. With Hillary it would happen arguably less often and more subtely, and almost no one would get to know about it because Paul Ryan would attempt impeachment every 6 months

Today we know republicans wanted a healthcare bill so they can free their donors from taxes. Instead the senate would be passing a bill to repeal Obama care every 6 months because they know Hilary would veto it.

They'd use this hate to fuel their local elections and win the house and the senate again.

Women's rights would get marginally better. With executive orders you'd get a few band aid fixes in Gun control but not enough to matter. The environment would be protected and so would net neutrality.

Rural America would still suffer, but they'd have someone to blame. The miners would get less work but more healthcare to deal with the shit their work gives them.

Basically. She'd be an uncharisamtic, more pro business, more hated, more attacked version of Obama. She'd get some things done but the Congress would ensure it's not much."

"My mom had a brain aneurism rupture about two months ago, shortly after her 44th birthday. It caused a stroke and seizures. She went into cardiac arrest twice at the hospital. She was intubated and sedated for 10 days. To top it all off she had walking pneumonia when she was admitted and her lung collapsed, so she had a lung stent in addition to the stent in her head. Miraculously, she made it. It affected her short term memory, balance, and vision, but she is still herself, which I am so thankful for. "

"I had a revelation a while ago after reading a book called the ""5 love languages"" (I am totally not normally into those types of book.) I was in relationship with a girl who seemed totally happy but never wanted any hugs, little physical contact. Her parents were the same way but utterly happy and in love with each other. The booked suggests 5 different ways people tend to show and want affection. One of those the book calls ""quality time"". They simply needed nothing more than being around each other. Not even necessarily doing anything interesting. I am very much of the ""physical contact"" school. I need a good hug to feel loved. 
Maybe your parents are like hers? Thoroughly recommend the book. (If you can ignore the background religious leanings of the author.)

"You are either playing around with words or you don't realize how stupid you sound.

Using your reasoning, slot machines at a casino are not about luck. They are preprogramed; the owner of that machine can go in and manually check the pattern of payouts a hundred plays ahead if they want. If you line up ten people and let them each play once, some of them will win, some will lose, and it's all down to what number in line they were. No choice they make in front of the machine will affect their chances. It was all decided when you gave them that particular place in line.

Are you seriously suggesting luck has nothing to do with winning here?

Sometimes I thought they would one day knock her over and eat her while she was throwing kitty chow at their heads. 

I should mention that all these ferals (indeed, most ferals in my town) were black, so when you passed the house they would be concealed in the shadows, but you would see their eyes flashing and their heads would all turn to track you as you walked by. It was like an early tension-building foreshadowing scene in a horror movie that got much worse once the characters went into the house. "

"It's also creepy given that the mistakes made could have happened to pretty much anyone in the same situation. I find the theory presented compelling, they were out of money couldn't afford proper sleeping arrangements, so they followed a road marked on their map in a direction that was supposed to have decent camping opportunities, not know that their car was not suited for this route. Once their car was stuck, there was nothing they could realistically do.

I would also add that our modern day security might trick us into thinking that nothing like this could happen out of nowhere, especially to ourselves. They were just driving around in America, following the map, having brought food and water with them. Would you have predicted the danger not knowing the area? In a similar situation, in an unfamiliar area, would you have known to ask the right questions to avoid getting in a similar situation?"

"I was the end of the line while we were hiking through the units on the old side of camp. Every so often, I would hear laughter behind me. I would turn and look, but see no one. At one point, when we were near the last campsite, I turned and saw a bush moving like something big just moved past it. Nothing else was moving that much, so it wasn't wind, and there's not a lot of ground cover in our area, so if something had moved past it, I would have seen it. I didn't see anything. Creeped me out a lot.

I was standing alone at our bathroom (an outside building that is just a roof and some walls around the toilets) by the sinks, washing my hands. I swear I see a kid out of the corner of my eye. Turn to look, no one is there. Immediately leave bathroom. Next day all of the toilets on the side I was standing on were clogged, but nothing was in them to cause the clog.

I when I walk alone on camp, I often hear laughter/talking coming from empty buildings. Something is often moving in the trees just out of sight. I can hear it rustling in the leaves, but I can't see it. I don't worry too much though. It feels safe.

We have a bear that protects our camp. The woods we are in are the woods where they release bears that they find in suburban/urban areas. Because of that, many bears in our area aren't afraid of humans, and are a little meaner than your standard bear. This one bear has been protecting our camp for as long as I can remember. She lives on the old side, but loves to walk through our side. She fights off other bears and any animal that tries to mess with us. One night, I was walking back from the bathroom when I see something move about 10 ft to my right. I turn and look, and sure enough it's the bear and one of her cubs, staring at me. I was in shock, I just froze for a few seconds. Once my brain caught up with the fact that yes, there is a bear standing 10 ft from me, I slowly started walking towards my cabin, parallel to were she was standing. She just let me go, then continued on her way. While this isn't a ghost story exactly, the bear has always seemed a bit supernatural. She's really intelligent and acts more like a protecting spirit than a bear.

I was in the unit closest to the old side of camp for two weeks one summer. I was in a cabin with 5 other people, but I always stayed up the latest due to insomnia. Everyone in my cabin was asleep for at least an hour at this point. I heard creaking and saw a light, so I sat up and looked out the window. Someone with a lantern was walking up the path from the old units, dragging a wagon. Interestingly, we don't use those wagons anymore. We used to use them to move luggage, but we gave them to another camp when we got trailers. 

I woke up early to watch the sunrise. I sat on our dock, since that was the best area to watch from. Our boating area is in another area of the lake, but it's visible from the docks. I swear I saw two people at the boating shed, sitting on the porch, but no one else was up. I was really worried, because I thought that if someone else saw me they would tell my boss and I'd get yelled at for going on the docks without a lifeguard. I checked over by boating after, so I could try to convince them not to, but no one was there, and the mud from the rain the night before had no footprints in it.

Those are the ones I can remember off the top of my head, but I'm sure there's more. I'll add some if I can remember.

Edit: I went back to the old side of camp today and walked around the abandoned units. At one point, in the unit where I saw the bush move in the first story, we heard a very distinct female child voice on the walkie. We stopped and looked at each other, and it went off again. No child on camp is allowed to use a walkie, and none of the other counselors sound that young. That's when we decided to leave. 

Later, I was in my unit waiting for the kids to grab their shit so we could go. There were two kids behind me, and my cocounselor in front of me. I very clearly heard a crying child say my name. I turned and looked, asking what was wrong. The kids just look at me blankly, and my cc asks me what I'm talking about. They didn't hear it. I did. I may be losing my mind. 

Also there are three shrines in my unit right now. There's a shrine to a dead something (moth?) that they made last year that's underneath a ramp and I'm not going to fight the spiders to get rid of it. There's a shrine behind my staff cabin to a dead salamander that some week 2 campers made. They originally made it on a stump outside their cabin, but we had to take it down after they left because that would probably freak out the next group of parents. My cc and I moved it to behind our cabin because we were pretty sure it was the only thing keeping our unit from falling apart. Although then it got neglected because we didn't know how to perform the daily rituals the kids were doing and frankly, we didn't have the time. Also, the salamander disappeared, but I'm pretty sure that was just a bird, not anything spooky. Lastly we have a shrine to a painting with weird symbols on it that one of the girls who made the shrine painted. That one is on a shelf next to my bed.

"I'm not rich by any means, but my wife and I have a very hefty savings account, with a chunk of each paycheck going into an IRA. We are very comfortable and being rather young still, going to school for our careers, I'd say we're well off.

Buying stuff to eat and drink at work. I have a set budget for it, and spend no more than $20 a week. But I budget that out, can afford it, and never go over. A guy I work with can't go a shift without going to papa Johns on his break, getting a small pizza, and washing it down with at least $5-10 of drinks he buys from the store. He easily spends $20-25 a day. That's $250 per paycheck he's just throwing away.

If you absolutely MUST eat at work, bring a lunch with you! Deli meat and bread goes a long way! Egg salad or regular salad, even! Switch over to bottled water, or if you MUST have your soda, buy it in bulk at $3 a 12pk instead of $2 for one bottle."

"I worked at target taking 20 credits in community college (so in class 8am to 5pm (pretty much) every weekday. When I gave them my schedule they said ok so like 18-20 hours a week. I thought that would still give me time for homework. So the first 3 months I worked there they were giving me 30-35 hours a week! Because it seemed like every week they were either ""short staffed"" or ""had inventory"". Ok I'm making some decent money but it's getting tough. I'm at school about 20 mins away. They are scheduling me for 5 and I get out of class at 450. So they keep ""coaching"" me on being late and how I don't seem to be getting work done quickly enough. Well I'm tired as fuck and of course I'm coming in late when you schedule me for times I cannot be there. I was also treated like trash when you were there. I had a ""team lead"" scream at me because I clocked in took a drink of my soda and put it in the fridge and she was screaming at me in front of everyone in the break room saying ""I wasted company time putting my drink in the fridge, you should do that before you clock in""... "". she also ripped me a knew one for taking a 17min break she ""timed it"" ok cool and then she ripped into me again for being in the bathroom for 8 mins. Ah yes because taking a shit at work is a felony apparently. I was fired before my ""probation period was up"" because of these issues that had been raised by one ""team lead"" fuck that place I hated target. Love shopping there hate working there. "
"This is a two part pile of crazy.

I'm an IT project manager. I specialise in huge data migrations during corporate mergers and demergers.

One time the client wanted to do a series of big bang migrations moving millions of customer accounts over the course of 5 or 6 days, with one of these every 1-2 months.

I ran the whole thing end to end, and we had big teams on the ground. I needed a 'runner' who would do everything from take dinner orders for everyone through to filling in template emails which went to the CEO, board etc in my approval. It was an exhausting role, but highly sought after. A good performance there pretty much guaranteed a good bonus and a promotion for the helpdesk staff I designed the role for.

One guy, fairly new, got a shot. I made absolutely certain he was fully prepped. Things immediately went wrong the moment he started his shift.

- He was late. He walked in, sat down, put his feet on my desk and started reading a novel. In front of half a dozen people include the duty head of department (director level, two rungs above me).
- He eventually agreed to do a handover with the outgoing runner.
- He took a personal call almost immediately, and disappeared for half an hour.
- He eventually came back, took over the to do list, and sat back down to read.
- understandably I went nuts at him, before the duty director confiscated his phone and book
- He disappeared again, then returned with a large meal he'd brought from home, cleared a space and started to eat. Sitting in the duty director's chair. Having just powered down their laptop and moved it. So he could stream a video to watch while he ate.
- I went nuts, director went nuts (director and I were mates). We called his team leader - who ended up driving into the office about 7pm on a Saturday to tell this guy to clean up his act.
- NO WORK HAD BEEN DONE YET.

- the second fuckup happened in the middle of the first.
- we FINALLY got him to go take dinner orders. Nando's - not hard, we'd warned them to expect a big order . Get everyone's individual order off the menu, then get an extra meal per 5 people.
- Duty director went to pay and collect to find that
1. The Nando's was in a near riot.
2. The place was full but no one could be served due to our order.
3. Clusterfuckwit-man hadn't ordered by the menu because the list was too long. He'd just counted the number of people and had ordered what he liked himself. Which was wings to start, a whole chicken, a large fries, some other stuff, and a 1.25L bottle of coke.  EACH. Plus the additional 1 meal per 5 people. (Let's not even mention the vegetarians)
4. The restaurant had been cooking just for us for an hour. A second car was needed to fit all the food which came to about £1000 instead of the expected  £200.
- dickhead just picked up a chicken and disappeared again

- First fuckup resumes.
- We got notification that the CEO and entourage of this multibillion pound company was going to be coming in to get a tour of the whole operation, as we were approaching go/no-go.
- Director tore strips of yet-to-look-at-to-do-list-man and we gave him step by step instructions on what to do. We had no time to supervise.
- He disappeared again. No one could find him
- CEO and co arrive. Everything's ready for them. We give our runthrough in the command centre. Then take them for a guided tour. Where we find Mr Useless, asleep, on the floor, surrounded by chicken carcass.
- Entourage includes director of this guy's entire department who's been made aware of the situation. Useless is woken up by said director, absolutely blasted. Apologies left right and centre. The CEO is trying to look all stern but is clearly about to crack up laughing.
- Until this moron marches straight up to said CEO and demands their immediate action on blatant harassment, bullying, racism etc, insisting I, the duty director, his team leader and head of department be sacked on the spot.

Which is how the bemused CEO ended up going home with several Nando's chickens and - somehow - the idea that a of us were some kind of miracle workers for completing everything as promised.

Like ""What do you want for dinner"" or ""did you choose a hotel yet?"" and then I'm so emotionally uninvested that I can't answer.

So I guess my answer is, if you're going on a rant make sure you let them know it's a rant and that they can stop you when they want?"

Mum: of course you can go
Me: I don't want to sleep over...
Mum: Well just tell her that. 

Whilst I thought it seemed rude, I had full faith in my mum and phoned my friend saying I could come, but not sleepover. When she asked why I told her I just didn't want to. She was understandably quite upset, and when I told my mother about this she said of course my friend was upset, and I should have used my mum as an excuse.

"Don't anybody dare mention the Persians, because any Persian will readily admit their goodbyes always last 45 minutes or longer.

**How to Say Goodbye the Persian Way:**

1. Two or three hours following dinner and now on your eighth cup of tea, finally give your spouse ""the look"" and get up from the couch. This is the first and hardest step.

2. Start thanking the hosts for a lovely evening, and begin telling everyone how glad you were to see them. Begin shaking hands and kissing cheeks. This is phase one of the goodbye and will usually last no longer than a minute.

3. Go and tell your kids (who have likely wised up by this point and are hiding from you in order to avoid leaving their friends) that it's time to go.

4. Without any direct action from you or anybody else, you will notice the entire group somehow slowly migrate to the front door. Here, you will spend at least 15 minutes talking about various things, almost completely negating the fact that you said you were going to leave.

5. Notice that your children are missing and have escaped back to the hosts' kids' bedroom. Go back and get them. Tell the hosts' kids how glad you are that they and your kids are good friends.

6. After you (and your children) have put on your shoes, you will spend 15 more minutes *outside* the front door, once again chit-chatting about various topics and occasionally punctuating these comments with reminders that it's cold outside and that the hosts should go back inside the house. Of course, they will refuse.

5. Once you have turned on the car, more exchanging of anecdotes will commence, followed by some extra jokes for good measure. This step will likely last anywhere between five and ten minutes.

6. Now that everybody is in the car, roll down the windows in order to say goodbye from inside the car – because not doing so would be considered rude. This can last five minutes or more. Ignore your squirming and annoyed and *perfectly reasonable* children sitting in the back.

7. Three minutes after driving away, your wife realizes she forgot something. Have her call the hosts and apologetically explain the situation to them. Drive back to the house.

8. Pull up front, roll down the window, and explain to them how embarrassed you are to have forgotten something at their house. Thank them once again for working so hard to create such a lovely and welcoming atmosphere. Tell jokes for ten minutes.

9. Finally – and hesitantly – drive away.

10. The next morning, have your wife call their wife and thank them for such a lovely evening, and tell them you should do it all over again the following weekend.

"And then I have to wonder, ""does the only person I know at this party actually not like me?"" I went through like an existential crisis my senior year of university, when the group I considered to be my best friends, who were also my roommates for a year and a half, would go out to the club without me. They'd talk about it around me, and I'd be like, ""why didn't anyone invite me?"" And they would tell me, ""you know we go every week. Just show up!"" So I started doing that, and none of them would hang around me. They were all hanging out with other people, and I was by myself drinking. It really kind of sucked to feel like in four years, the people I would say I'm closest to here don't even really care to be around me. I stopped going, and stopped talking to them, and they didn't seem to care because nobody made an effort to try to see me before I moved away. I graduated in May, so it still kind of sucks to feel like I couldn't form any sort of meaningful relationship there. "

"It's like comparing a public toilet in India to a public toilet in Pakistan. 

My favorite Bakersfield story... 

Witnessed an obese family hanging outside a gas station, each with their own 2 liter mountain dew and Doritos bag. A couple meth heads approached them (for money?) and one of the meth heads ended up knocking the mountain dew out of the father's hand which enraged him. Watching him struggling to chase two wiry meth heads around the parking lot was fairly entertaining.

I took his name as is tradition and kind of had a good go of it being that my first name started with the same letter of his last name.  So it worked.

15 year later, he was a criminally abusive asshole.  We divorced.

5 years after that, another man and myself consecrated our union, but we (both being divorced) didn't want to legally marry.  Just be together without the legal bull shit.

So I decided to just change my last name to his.

Legal proceedings - pretty simple - small town, judge knew me from long, drawn-out divorce and all the criminal activities my ex was accused of.

Judge asked, ""Why do you want to change your name?""  

I said, ""Because I'm with another man, but not getting married and I want no association with my former husband.""

Judge said, ""I don't blame you"""

Anyway he ended up spitting his food on me when I was ignoring him. The staff threatened the cops so he left.

"In downtown Portland, a few blocks from the Rose Festival (by the waterfront), a homeless man and woman engaging in oral sex. I should clarify, the man was giving the woman oral. When some friends and I were walking by, I first thought I was seeing a woman laying on the ground with a blanket over her. Then the blanket started moving around her crotch. We took a pic that I can upload if anyone wants to see (can't really see anything, thankfully). They had a cardboard sign that said ""Feeling the vibe with any left to spare? Anything helps"" When he realized we were watching, he sat up... smiled, then licked his fingers. She had the biggest bush I have ever seen. I can't imagine what it must have smelled like.

"There are a multitude of ways. Exfoliating is the act of removing the most superficial layer of dead skin on your face; you scrub your face a bit. There are tools for that that are nice, such as exfoliator gloves or Clarisonic skin brush, which physically scrub the skin. Some cleansing agents have little beads that scrub while you wash, or there are peel masks which pull the skin cells off with it. Lastly there are chemical exfoliants, which use a mild acid type compound that dissolves and breaks down that dead skin to then wash it off. General daily washing with just a face cloth and a good cleanser will do some exfoliating, but you would do better to use one of the methods above as is best for your skin type a couple times a week minimum. It will take you trying a couple things first to see what works best, and exfoliate gently at first so you don't harm your skin if it turns out to be sensitive. Follow cleansing/exfoliating with a skin serum if you wish, and a good moisturizer/sunscreen. r/skincareaddiction has some guidance there but don't get too wrapped up in their philosophy, they do get a bit over the top."

Totally agree with this. I was one of the last people of my group of friends to lose my virginity (18yo) and also lost virginity on a one night stand. mythrowaway4432 - you will wonder what all the fuss is about and lose your anxiety about it pretty quick. I felt like you do but wish I hadn't as that made me more nervous. Don't worry about whether you'll be any good in bed (porn totally gives a false idea of what most men are looking for in bed and if you did act that way most would probably be a bit freaked out and think you're faking it) and to be honest it's pretty automatic what to do. The guy I lost my virginity to never realised I was a virgin. He actually contacted me a year later to ask if I wanted to hook up again so it won't be obvious if that is some of your fear. Also I don't think decent people are that bothered about it but would be understanding about it if you told them. Lose the fear!

"The whole ""saved by a third party"" thing reminded me of a story my grandmother used to tell me about our civil war (Spain's Civil War, 1936-1939). Back then some people would go to your house to 'take you out for a walk', usually at night. So, this one night, some guys showed up at her uncle's ready to take him with them. His family cries as they quickly say goodbye to him before they try to break in or something. His wife takes their children and runs away to France, and from there to Morocco (where my grandmother lived), the next day.

So this guy is in the back of a truck, with more prisoners and his 'kidnappers'. They get to a field where they start gathering the prisoners for a mass shooting. Suddenly, this one guy grabs him by the arm and says ""Leave him to me, I know him"". He takes my grandmother's uncle to a place far from the others, figuring the guy wants to kill him his way or something. Suddenly, the guy stops and says ""*That way you'll find a town that'll take you in. Run*."" So my grandma's uncle runs away, wondering why this guy saved his life, makes it to the town and calls his family, who believed him to be dead.

My grandma says they never found out why this guy saved her uncle's life, but they always figured, as he was a doctor, he may have helped the guy or one of his relatives and he recognized him and decided not to kill him."

My older brother flunked out of college. Online community college. Twelve times. And mind you there is nothing wrong about online community college, but the classes he was taking were literally show up and pass classes. All he had to do was put a comment on some post or another once a week and he would've been fine. And he didn't. He instead lied to our parents until it was too late for him to drop without paying a fee (eventually, he wizened up and just dropped the classes immediately). But hey, he's an adult, right? So that's his choice? It would've been, but my parents were paying for his failure. They were paying for every time he'd pretend to be doing academic work and instead would play on his computer. And never once did he apologize. He instead would defend his actions and, as some kind of stress relief I guess? He'd use his spare time to try to cut ME down by making fun of and belittling my accomplishments, going so far to outright lie to our parents about things I didn't do (and have never done). He told them I crashed the car. I very did not. If anything every went missing or was broken ""oh, that was Skunky, I saw her do it too!"". 


My younger brother is incredibly pampered- something that shone through when it came time for us to pack up our home and move. He did literally nothing. Mom packed his room, mom cleaned up his things, mom made sure he had everything he needed, while I, and everyone else, was literally working from 6am to midnight painting, packing, and scrubbing. When we finally got to the new house, he got the first pick of bedrooms. Never mind that the options were a pink room or one of the two gray rooms. Never mind that I'm the one who worked the hardest AND I'm the only girl. He picked the pink room initially because it had a better view. When he wanted to switch (because he could hear bugs outside and it weirded him out) he got to. I had to repack all of the things I had just unpacked to switch with him. But then he started complaining that his bedroom was too small. So mom gave him the basement. Yes. The ENTIRE basement. She made sure it was a teenage boys PARADISE. There's a projector down there set up with every console imaginable (and a few of those plug and play consoles with infinite games). He has his own office with a crazy expensive personalized computer. He has ANOTHER bedroom down there. And he doesn't clean any of it- mom does. 

I'm sure I can think of a few more incidents if you'd like, but hopefully this can tide you over. I have like 20 years of material. (Sorry if the format is shit- I'm on mobile and it's early)"

"[Motivational posters hanging anywhere in the office.](http://cdn.successories.com/products/661/6614934/zoom_double_751691.jpg) 

Any manager that unironically hangs one of these anywhere is not smart enough to be competent at their job. 

I'm nearing 40 years old, I've been working since I was 15, and in that time I've held more than a dozen positions in various companies. Full stop. If you see one of these posters hanging in an office and it's not a joke, you are going to work in a terrible and probably toxic environment.

Also... if the hiring manager or the manager you'll be working for uses any variant of ""we work hard and play hard"" or ""we like to keep it fun around here""... it will be boring, it will not be fun, and ""play hard"" will be a costco sheet cake in the break room once a year for a company fun event that is not optional.

LinkedIn is the gateway to where most of our potential workforce resides (especially engineering and business) and is a stupid-valuable resource of data.

The benefit of things like LinkedIn Premium are primarily geared towards staffing professionals like me. It's useful because I get things like more inmails and greater network connectivity/visibility as well as the ability to partner with corporate accounts which allow greater flexibility to do things like share profiles/shortlist folks. If you're playing a hiring initiative game at some corporation, knowing more about your potential candidate pool is worth a goldmine and the ability to collaborate with your hiring teams can really be a time saver. As a candidate/job-seeker though, I imagine it's not really that useful beyond seeing who looked at your profile.

TL;DR: LinkedIn's purpose is geared towards Recruiters so that we can find you and people like you to fill our jobs. Also useful for job seekers to get in touch with Recruiters if they have a specific company/interest in mind."

Therefore, he argued that he was entitled to ask for millions of dollars in donations to 'transition' into a wealthy person.

"Sort of tangentially related. Long story short I was trying to convince someone I'd met that someone could google them and find out they had worked for Amway and that it would look bad. To provide an example I googled their name and found something worse.

Long version:

Met this guy in a college class who was a bit awkward but seemed like he had a good head on his shoulders. Nice enough, just 'weird'. Worked at KFC while going to school and loved the place - always talked about it and about how he wanted to go into marketing for them. Odd, but whatever.

Couple years later I'm in KFC and he's there - behind the counter. I ask him what's up and he starts telling me about how money was tight and he wasn't able to finish his college education 'yet'. Conversation turns a bit and suddenly it goes from 'money is tight' to 'yeah I'm making a bunch right now with my own business'. I make a mental note of that odd shift but act nice and he hands me an Amway business card. Oh no.

Normally I would be offended if someone tried to drag me into their Amway 'business' but this guy was so, I don't know - simple isn't quite the right word, but - simple that I felt bad for him. I had his e-mail on the business card (which was a very juvenile e-mail address to have on a business card) so I put together an e-mail.
I spent an hour or so informing him of what Amway was and how I knew he valued his employment at KFC so he shouldn't be handing out business cards on the job. I kept phrasing and re-phrasing things trying to be nice about it, trying to be helpful without being pushy.

I got to a part where I said something like, ""And what happens if, in the future, you're looking for a job and someone googles your name or your e-mail address. Them finding Amway may not look good on you.""

Then, to provide an example, I googled his name. Sex offender registry. "

Being in combat or fighting for your life. I have been in several ""fight or possibly die"" situations throughout my life, and I was also in the military in a combat position and have been in many very close calls with death. No one can possibly understand what it is like to go through that unless you have actually been through it. I don't wish it on anyone but I hate it when people try telling me ""now that really isn't necessary"" or ""you could of tried talking them down"". It most definitely does not work like that at all. 

Chronic insomnia. It's not as easy as people think it is to function off of 2-3 hours of broken up sleep a night. Especially when you work 12 hr days doing light-heavy labor. Sometimes it's several nights with zero sleep. People always think it's not possible to function off that much sleep. Or it's the other way around, and your employer thinks they can put you on call all night long after working all day, running road calls all night, then wants you to work two back to back shifts the morning after road calls. Thinking I don't need to sleep because I can't. 

Constantly vigilant. Due to how I was raised, my life experiences, and simply my nature. I am constantly on guard, I always make sure I know where exits are, I always have some sort of plan no matter what I am doing, or where I'm at. I am very blunt and loud with people who are acting off towards me or looking for trouble, this helps prevent an actual problem happening. I carry a gun all the time. I also have no problem taking someone down who is acting with intent to harm. When you go through the things I have in my life, you know what people will do over anything no matter how big or small, and you learn the signs very quickly and it's stamped in your memory permanently. People call me paranoid, or they say I'm always looking for trouble. But every single situation I have been in, the other person that I end up in some sort of confrontation with has always been a previous criminal, and was actively trying to either rob, harm, kill,  something they shouldn't be doing, and I was the targeted victim, or someone with me. I have only had 1 person who didn't have a record but was found out to be hanging out with a group of people who were all part of the same gang, he was trying to get initiated into it.  This one specifically pisses me off, especially when something actually does happen and there is some fucking cunt/ass hole standing there being nosey after it all happened judging me like I did something wrong, and usually saying ""all that wasn't necessary you could of just walked away"". Yea because a thug isn't going to stab you in the back. Typical idiots who have never once in their life been in anything more than a heated discussion. "

" My suitemate was a hoarder and shopaholic. Whenever she was distressed, she would order expensive things online even when she couldn't afford it, then she would just leave boxes all around the suite. 
She also never washed her hands after going to the bathroom and wouldn't shower regularly and never cleaned the bathroom. She thought she was a good cook and would leave dirty dishes laying around the common room until they would grow mold. Whenever she left her room door open an awful smell would float into the common area.

She had a boyfriend and they would sing songs from musicals at the top of their lungs at night time. She was also emotionally abusive to her boyfriend and would scream at him really loudly. 

She was obsessed with my best friend and they ended up having a falling out due to all these issues. My friend let her borrow a sweatshirt that she really wanted back. The suitmate told me she left it on the sofa for my friend to come get but my friend told me it wasn't the sweatshirt she wanted and texted her letting her know she still needed the specific sweatshirt back.

We were sitting down the hall from my suite and we suddenly heard intense and very angry screaming about someone being a ""bitch"" a group of boys walking down the hallway to go to their room stopped and turned to one another with shocked and scared expressions and said ""oh jesus."" before quickly leaving. The whole first floor could probably hear her.

I decided that I should just go inside the room and that hopefully me being there would make her self-conscious enough to get her to stop. She was screaming at her boyfriend who just stood there and took it. Then she turned to me and screamed full force in my face. It was terrifying. She was completely out of control emotionally.

One of my other suitemates hated her so much that she would leave empty cat food cans in the bathroom so it would stink. I was the only one who actively and regularly cleaned up after her and just put up with her.

"I was 19 years old, on my own for the first time, and had to diffuse a potential suicide thanks to my crazy ex-roommate.



In college, I lived with a friend who I wasn't that close with--more of an occasional hangout than a close friend. I knew she was socially awkward, but who isn't sometimes? I liked her enough, and she seemed pretty normal. Man was I wrong.


She had this boyfriend. They had been dating since high school and were attached at the hip. This got annoying: he became like an extra roommate who didn't pay bills. If he wasn't in class, he was at our place. He would stay over even when she wasn't there. Whenever I brought over friends, the roomie/bf would both swarm them and beg for attention because they finally got to socialize with someone other than each other. I tried to do things to help the situation: asked if they could respect boundaries more, asked him to help with chores or buying toilet paper. They were just generally oblivious to the amount of space they took up, how loud they were, etc. Not to mention my roommate was extremely emotionally unstable, which I didn't know until we lived together.




But that's not the story. I wake up at 3 a.m. to the sounds of screaming and hysterical crying. This was almost a weekly occurrence with my roommate, so I went back to bed. Her bf was there to help her.


Then the pounding started, like a rhythmic banging on the wall. Should I do something? No, she has episodes like this. I used to try to help her, but I've figured out she just wants attention, hours of it.




Then she and the bf come out into the hall. She is screaming at the top of her lungs. I hear objects being thrown. I hear him yelling. I'm a 19 year old kid who's never been in a domestic violence situation. Do I call the police? Do I intervene? Then I hear him yell, ""Put down the knife!"" At this point, I'm terrified. I lock the door and go call 911. Fuck, my phone's not on the charger. I look around, but I realize it's probably in my backpack in the living room. My laptop is in there too. I have nothing.




I wait it out in my room for a few minutes. The yelling and throwing stops. I'm listening to them talk. From the conversation, I figure out that she wasn't trying to stab him, she was trying to cut herself. There was lots of ""Why shouldn't I do it, you don't love me anyway!"" I open the door halfway. They are sitting on opposite couches sobbing. There are big kitchen knives on the coffee table between them. Stuff is strewn all over the floor: her glasses, the trash can, an old pizza box. I can't get to my phone without walking through the middle of it.


I ask what the hell is going on. He had been ""flirtatiously texting"" girls from his classes. Had she read the texts? ""Yes, all of them."" Had he met up with any of them? ""No."" Had he made plans to meet up with any of them? ""No, but the texts were flirtatious."" So she read some of the texts to me. He definitely was being suggestive, and I understand getting emotional. But that's when you discuss breaking up. Throwing objects? Threatening to kill yourself because he doesn't love you? That is flat out domestic violence.



I am livid. I tell them that this is ridiculous and immature behavior, and clearly they shouldn't be in a relationship. I tell him that for his safety and his sanity, he needs to leave our apartment and spend ONE WHOLE NIGHT at his own. I take all knives, razors, and medication and lock them in my room with me. I tell her that if I hear one more outburst, I am calling the police on her. In retrospect, I probably should have anyway, but the situation had calmed down, so I didn't think the police would do much.




The kicker? He didn't even leave. He spent the rest of the night with her in her bed. I didn't renew the lease and moved out shortly after that. I haven't seen much of them since, but they are still together according to facebook. I know they were planning on getting married back when we lived together. I hope that doesn't happen. He needs to get out of that relationship, and she needs mental help."

"I've had horrible roommates in the past, but three really stand out.

The first was a girl I worked with who was just totally chill, we were great friends, etc. She moved in, didn't want to pay rent or utilities, used all of my food, then left the dryer on high heat and left for the day - our dryer was old and had no shut off timer, so it would run until you turned it off. We were extremely lucky to not have a fire.

The second was a friend of my ex's, who was a compulsive liar, ended up selling drugs out of my home without my knowledge, let his boa constrictor get loose for two days without telling me (while I have a small dog running around). He kicked my dog, and just acted like a jackass in general, then refused to pay. 

The third was a friend of the second. He was underage but his parents couldn't control him, so they asked if he could stay with us. He refused to shower or wash his clothes, pissed on our futon and didn't clean it, and ran off after two weeks. His parents were upset they had to take him back and refused to pay us rent for him. He snuck back in a month later to see our other roommate and wouldn't leave, so I got to call the cops on the little bastard. The last I heard he was arrested about ten years ago for bringing weed into a courthouse. Dumbass."

"Bridesmaid pulling a train in the men's bathroom at the reception. 

She was... Unhappy as the best friend of the groom who obviously had some unrequited feelings. The bride very graciously had her in the wedding party, and this bridesmaid did such classy things to repay her like trying to push the bride to be to blow a stripper or have a final fling before the wedding (obviously to tell the groom she was cheating on him), try to seduce the bride's brother, tried to seduce the groom's brother (who was the best man), and showed up to the wedding smashed. 

When all of that failed to get a suitable rise out of the bride and groom, she decided to skip the speeches, snort a couple of rails (so I'm told), and drag any guy she could into the bathroom to bone (and there were several, she was a pretty girl). 

TL;DR: attended cousin's wedding, went to men's room and found a line of guys waiting to bang a drunken,, drugged up bridesmaid while she cried about the fact she was in love with the groom who didn't want her despite how hard she'd tried to prove her love for him by attempting to ruin his wedding and the lives of him and his bride who had been nothing but sweet and understanding.

"She was definitely an escort from backpage. She actually showed me her backpage when pressed. She wasn't a high class escort and apparently didn't have too many other places to go. We spent a long time talking about the consequences of this lifestyle (what else am I supposed to do...she wouldn't leave). I never imagined I'd be trying to talk someone out of being a prostitute. She ended up staying for a while and cleaning the whole house but Dave just stayed passed out and eventually she caught a ride out to who knows where. She stayed in contact with me for a while through FB but she disappeared from there. One thing I talked her into was investing in a laptop and just being a cam girl instead of fucking and getting urinated on (yes, he pissed on her multiple times) by grubs like my meth head roommate Dave.

"Oh! I got one! Not a cop but whatever, how often does this topic come up...

So, I answered a random cragislist ad a while back to become a house auctioneer, and no shit, there I was months later doing it, no real training, just a virtual slap on the back, ""read the script"" and ""don't worry the buyers will help you - they know how the process goes"". Which seems like a totally reasonable way to prep someone to handle transactions worth a quarter million or so each. Incredibly, they were not wrong, got the hang of it pretty quick because it's really not that complicated. I got to learn how cashiers checks and vesting clauses work!

Anyway, mostly the job was just watching rich old guys gripe at one another as they slowly bid up properties, and that was when things even got that interesting, a lot of times I'd just show up to an empty sales site and loudly announce that file blah-blah was postponed to date blah-blah. Sometimes the people who lived in the properties being repossessed would show up to see what happened, if someone bid or if the bank took it back.

So, one day, I have a lady show up along with a friend, and she starts pulling this sovereign citizen business on me. Started off by walking up to me and informing me that ""You are being served"" and handing over a big manila packet of documents. This was totally unprecedented, as I am representing a 2nd layer of contractors, if you have a problem you'd need to serve the bank, or maybe the larger contractor who hired my company, or some shit, serving me legal docs is about as effective in this situation as serving docs to your local McDonald's cashier to start a lawsuit against corporate. So this derails everything. I stop proceedings so I can call my supervisors and discuss this. As I'm doing so I start reading the packet, and wow, it was like like reading legal text from insanitytown. It was a whole bunch of *property notarized* (like, with tracking information for an actual presumably non-crazy notary, along with what I can only hope is an unusually large number of disclaimers, both separate and stamped onto some of the docs, stating that the notary was only witnessing the existence of the document and not making any statement as to the validity of the information in it) documents stating the usual sovereign citizen crap, stuff about how her debts had been paid using secret non-fiat gold hidden in the name of all citizens and such, and trying to present checks written out as from the IRS as being able to settle her outstanding mortgage debt.

So I sent in pics of all this and discussed it all with my supervisors, and I got the word back that ""these are not legal documents, this does not settle her debts or change any standing, proceed with the auction"". At which point she got rather pissed, kept trying to yell over proceedings, asked us how we sleep at night, the whole nine yards... It was something.

I kept the packet, maybe I should scan it in and remove the name, it was some grade A loonybin stuff.

Before anybody gets to worried for her, as far as I'm concerned, she signed for a mortgage and then didn't pay for it, lived without paying any rent for a couple years, and then expected the legal equivalent of homeopathy to keep her in the house. I'm not really super sympathetic to her."

"I don't know if it can be considered an anarchist view of the world. The thought experiment is designed to answer the question ""Do we need a government?"" and was devised before the concept of anarchism crystallized.  It is often the week one topic in an Into to Political Philosophy class.

In *Leviathan*, Hobbes argued that in a state of nature, the life of man is ""nasty, brutish, and short.""  Let's say that someone in your tribe (Tribe A) kills a member of another tribe (Tribe B), it does not really matter whether the killing was an accident or done of purpose.  The natural reaction of Tribe B is to avenge the death of their member by killing a member of Tribe A.  Now Tribe A feels that they need to kill a member of Tribe B to avenge the death of their member.  This process will repeat over and over again until one or both of the tribes are gone.  

Hobbes argues that this constant state of violence is why everyone in society should give up some of their freedom to a powerful being - in Hobbes's time he meant an absolute monarch, now we read this as a government - to put an end to the violence so that society may prosper.

This state of nature will always exist at the highest level.  As much as we talk about the United Nations being the closest thing we have to a ""world government,"" it really isn't.  The UN cannot make a decision that the nations have to follow in the same way that Congress can make laws that bind the states and territories.  If the world unified under one government and we discovered life on another planet, another state of nature would develop between the Government of Earth and the Government of [Planet].

About the ""we have our fingers on nukes"" comment, I don't know how true that actually is.  If it were completely true, the nuclear countries would always get the best deals.  But as history has shown multiple times, this is not true.  Egypt was successful in taking control of the Suez Canal against France, Israel, and the UK; the US and UK lost access to Iran's oil; Yugoslavia did not listen to the USSR. There has been many times that the non-nuclear countries have told the nuclear countries to ""Shut up and sit down"" and the nuclear countries have listened."

He runs to the back, returns, then gives me the wallet. Just then, a guy comes to the store and says ""I dropped my wallet. We close the store about 15 minutes later. I count up the money and the wallet had $1200.

"I am a lawyer, but most of the loopholes I've actually encountered are pretty uninteresting. So instead, I'm going to introduce a theoretical loophole involving drunk driving that we talked about in one of my law school classes. (Actually I did think of one that's kind of noteworthy so I added it as well.)

*edit - spelling/formatting

**Theoretical Drunk Driving Defence**

So while most urban legends tell you keep batteries, or pennies, or gum, etc. in your car in case you get stopped for a DUI check, the most effective option might be to actually keep another bottle of liquor with you. The idea is that after you get pulled over, you get out of your vehicle and, in full sight of the officer, you open a clearly sealed bottle of liquor and chug it. After you chug it, you smash the bottle the ground.

Why chug the liquor? 

So that now you can make the argument that you became intoxicated after you were pulled over and after you stopped driving. Perhaps you were just really nervous when you were stopped so you decided to drink to settle your nerves. Or maybe you're one of those defiant types who says ""Oh you think I'm drunk?? Fine! If you're accusing me being drunk, I'll get drunk!!"". I don't know how convincing any of this would actually be, but all you have to do is raise a reasonable doubt.

Why smash the bottle?

This is so the officers can't determine how much you chugged on the spot and therefore extrapolate how much you would have had before that. 

So would any of this work? I really don't know. I remember doing a bit of caselaw research to see if I could find something reported and on point but never came up with anything. I don't encourage finding yourself, but if anyone can link a case where this was tried I'd be very amused.

**Not My Pants Drug Possession Defence**

This one also involves intoxicating substances. I spent the first two years of my law career prosecuting drug crimes so I got pretty familiar with some of the drug dealer tricks of the trade. 

One common tactic is to try to cast doubt on the ownership of the drugs. This was often done by stashing the drugs in, say, the rafters in the hallway of an apartment building instead of the dealer's actual unit. If fingerprints, cameras, or other evidence can link you to the stash its probably game over, but you'd be surprised how often it causes difficulty for the prosecution.

Another related defence to this is the ""not my pants"" defence. I didn't try this case personally, but I did watch my colleague do it. So the accused is pulled over by the police and is found to have a baggie of cocaine on him (i think it was somewhere between 1 - 2 grams). 

His defence at trial is that while at work, he changes into clothes that are specialized for his job (farm related I think) and that at the end of the day, when he changed back, he accidentally threw on his co-worker's trousers. He was able to get his co-worker to come into court and testify that those were in fact his pants, and that he did in fact leave some cocaine in them (He had been looking everywhere for it!!!). This guy had a documented history of drug abuse so that probably gave it an air of reality.

Its probably worth noting as well that in my jurisdiction your testimony at someone else's trial can't form the basis of criminal charges. It makes shenanigans like this easier, but it also encourages people to come forward who wouldn't otherwise. "

"It might not be important to you, but it sure is important to others. If they don't feel like they're getting certain needs met in a relationship, it's their right to bring up the issue. It's also the other person's right to refuse to accommodate the other's needs if they don't feel like it. And in response, it is the other person's right to end the relationship over that.

How about we don't judge people for what they deem to be important for themselves? To me, it's strange that someone doesn't feel like sex is an important part of a relationship, but I'm not thinking that they're a bunch of prudes because of it. If it's how they view their life, let them."

Which is odd because most of the bosses in that game are actually not all that bad once you get used to the spacing and timing, when to commit and when to retreat.

He exists in a swirling void where it's often hard to judge perspective, how close or how far he is to you, and there is NO let up. You're given just enough time to maybe, if you're in the exact right space, get one hit in on him before he's on you like white on rice again. Dodges must be perfectly timed, attacks must be perfectly timed, and if you are even a single millisecond out on your timing, consider your furniture dusted.

And about that, I don't mean to minimize suffering but let's picture that for a second. Picture your town is taken by skill and technology superior you can't hope to match.

If you surrendered early, the town is divided and plundered. God help you if you hold out. And since women are property in mongol eyes, you get to watch any bachelorette be taken as a ""wife"". One town got clever and married every woman alive. The khan said no, and annulled every marriage under year long. Publicaly. With all his men. Some girls were as young as six. Resistance? Don't make me laugh. Mongols trained for war from 3, and drew &gt;150lb compound bows. You would be playing with an Olympic athlete, in battle gear. Then if the town was not an asset or they had a battle close by, the civilians were split by usefulness. Armorer's, skilled trades could live. Useless were arrow catchers, driven I front of the army to take casualties. Usually inflicted by their countrymen, whose next castle wa assaulted.

Oh. So you fought back? Well picture more rape but also utter extermination. No human rights at all, culled with Nazi efficiency and iron age technology. Soldiers had quotas, eg bring back 50 left ears each. Tales tell of whole wagons of ears. Plural. If you were out, you died. If you hid, you got to listen to screams of everyone you love for a week, while all goods are looted, all food taken or destroyed and everything put to the torch. Anything they couldn't take would slow them down, so they razed it. And if you lived through that, you were left without food, in the ruins of your home, surrounded by innumerable rotting corpses. Before a cleanup raid came by to ensure no survivors."

"My sister-in-law is a middle school English teacher and she's told me several times about a student she had a number of years ago named Brendan.

Brendan had an unrequited and very obvious crush on a classmate named Melinda. During their poetry unit, each student had the opportunity to recite a favorite poem in front of the class. The first hand up was Brendan's, which was unusual to my SIL since she described Brendan as a greasy neckbeard type.

Brendan stood up in front of the class and began reading the lyrics to *Scar Tissue* by the Red Hot Chili Peppers while locking eyes with Melinda. Only as the song went on, he began to harmonize more and more until he was doing a full on Anthony Kiedis impression. *With the birds I'll share this lone-lay viewww^w^w^w^wwwwwwwwwwwwww* That kind of thing.

My SIL looked over at Melinda who was candy apple red, looking down at her desk and shaking her head either in disbelief or despair. 

When Brendan got to the guitar solo part of the song he started to scat the music. *Dewwwww, dewwww, dewwww. Dewwww, dewwww, doop boo woop a woop a woop ahhh wooop.* Like that. He started stuttering as he got towards the end of the song and he had neither won over his crush, nor brought the class to their feet with his impressive performance. He bailed during the last chorus and ran to the bathroom and my SIL got a male colleague to follow him. 

The other teacher reported back that when he entered the bathroom he just heard low, mournful sobbing and splattering shit sounds coming from one of the stalls. He turned around and left without saying a word and wished my SIL luck."

The issue of having a chronic mental or physical illness isn't temporary.

The fact your child died and the pain of losing them isn't temporary. 

Having been severely sexually abused as a child or being in a war and having horrendous PTSD as a result isn't temporary. 

All this statement does is help put little ""problems"" in perspective for little whiners who aren't really suicidal, and then makes *actual* suicidal people feel patronized, invalidated, angry and ten times worse. Because for most people who actually DO commit suicide, that problem wasn't clearing up anytime soon.

A squick might be something like m-preg or certain kinds of fetishes - something that someone might be put-off by or have zero desire to read. They might legitimately be unsettled or disgusted by it, even. 

But trigger is something that has a severe psychological effect, literally triggering flashbacks of a traumatic event or putting someone into a mental tailspin for hours after the fact. Stuff like rape or violence? That's a trigger warning. I think that if a piece of material contains stuff along these lines, that's a trigger warning-worthy thing. 

I see ""content warnings"" are more common, which I kind of prefer since it connotes different things, but it kind of irks me since people *are* into some weird or outright controversial shit. The author should be permitting to write/draw what they want. So long as it's not violating consent laws or promoting outright human rights violations, *and* they warn the audience, they should be able to produce it and the audience that wishes to consume it can. 

I'm not into stuff like vore, but I'm not going to tell an artist they can't draw it because that's not what I'm into. I like to write slash - someone has no right telling me I can't do that because they don't like it when boys bang. "

"Lowest level: Hauptschule, ends after grade 9.

"I will never forget my first cruise trip due to a similar situation. 
In the morning the crew had been doing a man overboard drill but I thought it was just another routine precaution. After coming back exhausted from that day's excursion I took a nap and they began announcing man overboard again, but I thought somehow they kept going with the drill. Moments later I feel the boat revving back and forth, and doing unusual turns. By now it's 7pm and I'm awake wondering what's happening. As I'm making my way upstairs everyone is talking about the missing lady who fell overboard right as we were leaving the last port, which by now was over an hour ago, and the boat has begun to turn back to look for her. Many people were even on the top decks looking to see if they could spot her in the water.
I'll never forget sitting down to dinner, and just as I get my food, I see the body in a black two piece bathing suit face down floating in the ocean and hear everyone trying to notify the crew. For about 10-15mins, the body is just floating and nothing is being done.  Needless to say dinner was pretty done for everyone after that. 
Not sure how they knew she fell overboard and didn't just immediately grab her out, but by that time nothing could be done. After that many rumors surfaced saying she fell off the balcony in her room that was on a top floor.

Tldr: on my first cruise ship, a lady fell overboard from her balcony right after we left a port on a day they were doing a man overboard drill. The boat spent about 2 hours looking for her, only to find her dead and floating face down in the water, where she was left for ~15mins for everyone to witness during peak dinner time."

"It's hard to sort people who actually like you versus people who are swayed by your looks. I had a teacher who was really encouraging and said I was great and he ended up hitting on me. Really did a number on my self esteem. 

Regardless what some circles say, there isn't much meaningful value in knowing random people objectify and want to fuck you.  

It is easy to tie your self value in your looks. This might seem counterintuitive to the previous point but it is a shallow and unfulfilling trap that can make getting older terrifying and make you insecure on all other aspects of yourself. 

Aggression goes up in others. I think. People get genuinely angry from jealousy or expectations unmet. You get accused of things you didn't even think.  

People discount your thoughts and feelings because attractive people have it easier in life. Then you're that asshole if you say something.

Imagine every time you left the house people stared at you, made comments, tried to get at you. It can be anxiety inducing. "

I obviously cant see anything because i hadnt bothered putting my glasses back on so going on my senses i assumed it was a guy so i point her in the direction of the male toilets (about 3 metres away from me), she then looks at me and says ""uhhmm i need the womens"", in my mind im like ""wtf why"" and i put the glasses back on and see it was actually a woman so i abruptly apologise and direct her to the female toilets (about 10 metres away from me).

"The goal is always to find permanent families for kids in foster care whether that's returning them to their birth parents, long term care with extended family (grandparents, aunts and uncles etc) or through adoption. Unfortunately in England at least care proceedings go on for years so most children who are eligible for adoption are at least 1 if not 2 years old. It's extremely rare to have a single baby up for adoption. You may find a baby as part of a sibling group but I think in the 4 years I worked there we only ever had 1 baby.

There are very close links between the fostering and adoption services (foster carers facilitate meetings with adoptive families once a placement has been agreed etc) and there are instances when foster carers do adopt children in their care but it is the exception rather than the rule."

"My aunt killed herself in 2015. Many months prior to her suicide, I blocked her number on my mom's phone because my aunt was so toxic and horrible and was really impacting my ma negatively. Mom's not tech savvy and it wouldn't have been unlike my aunt to go months without contact when her life was going okay, so mom had no clue anything was wrong. 

In my efforts to keep the cat in the bag, I unblocked my aunt's number on ma's phone on our way to the scene in case she checked...I had no idea iPhones deliver previously blocked texts and voicemails after unblocking. My aunt had reached out to mom the day before she killed herself and many times in the months preceding. Clearly, mom knew something was up and that I was probably responsible, and I didn't want to lie to her further so I came clean. That was definitely the most difficult admission of guilt and apology I've ever given.

That said, I do not regret what I did. My aunt was a terrible person with a lifetime of mental health issues that she absolutely *refused* to treat properly. She was also a hard drug user, often a thief, and the guilt-tripping-most person I've ever met. Her presence was poisonous."

I hunched over in pain, which would have given him a perfect kick to my face. But he backed off. I held him back for another 10 minutes or so before he had to take a breather, due to the fact he was a heavy smoker. I gave him the same courtesy.

But a kid from another group came up and actually kicked me in the back while I was on the floor. Now, I'm not usually a violent person, but this got me. 

I got up, grabbed a pair of scissors, and pretended to throw them. He ducked, and I charged at him, ramming him into a desk. I still had the scissors since I didn't actually throw them. I was about to stab him, but I snapped out of my rage before I did. Needless to say, nobody really made fun of me anymore, because the joke was that they'd be stabbed. Sure they were joking, but I like to think they didn't want me to snap again."

"Seriously. At the end of the day, humans are hunter gatherers. We spent millions of years evolving our diet to eat meat and shit we can gather by hand, like fruits and veggies. A few thousand years of farming and domestication are not going to magically change our dietary needs. The only argument science has is in what proportions are 'healthiest.' But considering the human lifespan is at an all time average high, I'd say our diet is more or less good as it is.

edit:  I never said anything about not eating in moderation. This was agreeing with the previous statement ""Meat isn't bad for you."" This is correct, we are evolved to require resources found in meat in our diet. Everyone here is going on and on about moderation and stuff. I NEVER SAID WE DIDN'T. I also said that science is only arguing about what proportion of meat stuffs in your diet is healthiest. Which is also correct."

I get it--the pictures are beautiful--but I can. not. imagine myself putting pictures before home ownership. People who are planning/paying for weddings constantly say ""oh I wish I could elope""...just do it! It was the best decision we made. "

Because tuition today versus thrity years ago isn't over triple what it was back then. One year of tuition at most public colleges runs close to what I make in a year at my current job."

"Last weekend:

I had bought a pork roast too close to the sell-by date. Opened it a couple days later – it was bad (smelled!!). Double wrapped it in white trash bags. I wanted to get rid of it before trash day, so I tossed it in the back of my truck. On the way to work later, I stopped for gas. 

I saw a trash can by the pump, so I squeezed the package in. It was a tight fit into the can due to the can lid's small opening, and it (being a 5 pound roast) was visible through the two layers of white garbage bags...kinda pink with blotches of white fat. Wet-looking. *gag*

I had to push a little, but it plopped in, hitting bottom with a thunk. I then noticed a woman at the other pump REALLY eyeballing me. I met her gaze, smiled and said ""What a shame. I'll be more careful next time.""

Her eyes widened, and I walked the few steps to my truck and left.

She photographed my license plate."

The most they could charge her with *right now* is child endangerment for leaving Sky in the car, but the detectives are certain she had something to do with his disappearance, so they won't arrest her until they can charge her with something bigger. If they charge her with child endangerment and it's found that Sky was never in the car to begin with, it would royally fuck their case if she was found to have murdered him. "

"This thread has made me remember a forgotten memory. I am actually not even sure if it's real or if created. But when I was 7ish, I remember (I think) walking home from school (it was only about 3 blocks from home), and a man pulled up to me. This guy was happy and charismatic, asked me if I remembered him because he was on his way to visit my parents. He said some things about how I grew up so much since the last time I saw him and that I should just get in the car because it would be faster and I would see him at home anyways.

I did not get in, but I remember (I think) it was because I liked walking home - I did not feel threatened by this piece of shit. 

These abductions are so easy to take place, kids are tragically innocent. There's this youtube video about a guy who gets permission from parents to ""abduct"" their kids. With puppy in hand, it literally takes him about 15 seconds, and the kid will even walk away holding the stranger's hands.

The fourth girl for that tent was accidentally put in a different unit and they decided to let her stay for the night before moving over, otherwise there would have been four girls instead of three. There were also reports of someone grabbing for campers in the dark by the latrine in a different unit but the counselors thought it was a prank.

I love them now - I prefer green to black, though if I order a pizza for a group of people I always go for black olives, since so many folks don't like green olives.

Green olives taste somewhere between vinegar (Probably because they soak in it) and Spinach+Kale.  I find them absolutely delicious, now."

"I am an officer in the Army, and did some research on this in grad school.

Now, there are a bunch of variables that can also affect this (like sex/race/parents education), but what I found was that out the gate, an 18 year old kid will make more money in the military than someone who just went into the workforce out of high school, no college.

But, as you progress into your 20s, the wage gap narrows, and there's actually a point in your military service where getting out puts you at a disadvantage.  Around 8 years or so, so 26-27 years old, if you haven't gotten a college degree, certifications, etc., it's almost as if many employers look at the 8-10 years you've spent in the military as time you've spent outside the workforce.  So at that point, joe blow who just went right out of HS into HVAC or something was probably making more money than the 18 year old kid that gets out after 2 contracts, even if right out of college, the service member was earning much more.

If you don't use any of the resources at your disposal to get a college degree, or other certifications that matter in your field (I am in the signal corps so for us it would be CCNA, Sec+, etc.) you are probably better off staying in 20 years and retiring in the service.  Which is sometimes easier said than done.  My research was actually on how the Army could better produce certifications or job training that could be measured by civilian employers or be equivalent to civilian education."

Unalog- The spirit world connecting with the human world. Was tricked by the force of destruction and chaos.

"A coworker had casually mentioned to me that she could tell I had been to the beach as she could see that I had a bikini strap tan line visible near my shoulder/clavicle area on a casual Friday when I was wearing a maxi dress 

A different coworker chimed in with ( haven't you people ever heard of---of closing the goddamn door? Oh no)Sorry couldn't resist.

But seriously, another lady chimed in by confidently declaring that black skin doesn't tan. I'm black. I had a tan. I provided a full primer on what melanin is.  She insisted that only white skin tans in the sun. She insisted that: With Black, Hispanic and Asian people, whatever complexion/shade they had at birth is the shade they'll have throughout their whole life, irrespective of sun exposure. Because only white skin tans. 

I pointed out that in some countries or cultures, people use an umbrella or parasol in order to keep from tanning. She called me a liar. A ""liar"" for saying that human skin tans in the sun.  A liar.  If this was a HAES conversation I'd have told her to educate herself. But, it wasn't, so I legitimately tried to provide some understanding. 

I asked her if she'd ever seen a Mexican roofer. Not being racist here--hear me out--I assured her that the skin color of that roofer was darker  than it was when he was born. And it was because working in the sun  had tanned his skin. Coworker's mind = BLOWN.

Many areas are not going to be able to ""defend their seaborders"". Creating dikes or seawalls are incredibly expensive projects and are not even feasible in many areas due to high porosity in the bedrock or soil or other issues. Basically you might be able to keep it from coming in horizontally most of the time, but it is still going to come up from underneath. You can try to pump it out, but that is also crazy expensive and can't realistically keep up with the rates in most areas. That isn't even considering the catastrophic problems of storm surges, which are with a very high level of confidence predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude. Besides those obvious issues, there are severe issues with salt intrusion in fresh water supplies, especially aquifers, in coastal areas. Sewer lines, canals, and other drainage systems that currently rely on a flow of water to travel from a higher elevation to a lower sea level will no longer be effective, creating huge health risks and further problems with flooding from rainfall. No the Maldives will be gone. My home in Miami will be gone. Many other coastal areas will be gone. Sure people aren't going to just wait and let the slow water take them, but it depends on the whole global community to respond well for minimized deaths through mitigation, especially for people in impoverished nations. Some will die in storms. Some will die of hunger. Some have incredibly difficult lives as climate refugees. Hopefully most will be graciously taken in with open arms in other countries and cities, but does that really sound like the world we live in right now? Please just understand that we do not currently have even close to the economic means or technology to save these places and what is actually incredibly naive is believing that we do."

Now I must explain that this person has worked at the bar for over a year at this point and after filling her in the finer details of rum and coke making skills, I look at the guy half unconscious on the floor and even he, in his current state, looks at me like, is this bitch for real?...  "

She was sitting in a busted as fuck Grand Marquis. We talked, said she never played numbers. Said it was the last of her cash. Desperation. Didn't ask any questions. Offered her a cigarette. Said no. Asked if I thought she might win. Told her it's possible. It wasn't. The drawing happened ten minutes earlier. 1703. I quit that job the following evening."

"At least they issued you extra text books. 

My high school banned backpacks during the school day, with the argument being you have seven minutes to go from class to class. It should be no problem to stop at your locker. 

Of course, the reason we had seven minutes was because the school was midway through a remodel and had one-way hallways that were literally runs of 2x6s because the floor was gone and if you had a few classes on the opposite side of the school from your locker, you were fucked. "

Excellent. Just want to add that this is the main reason that starting in your 20's is so important. Yeah, starting in your 40's is better than nothing, starting in your 30's is better, but the way compound interest works, the biggest gains are seen at the very tail end of the investment period. The difference between starting 30's and 40's might be a couple hundred thousand dollars, but the difference between 20s and 30s might be over half a million. It could be the difference between merely a survivable retirement, and a comfortable one.

"i have a biology degree not a physics degree - but i am never a fan of the idea that consensus understanding of the universe is cemented and unchangeable. i see this type of discussion in a lot in forums, where someone who has spent some time articulating a thorough grasp on certain concepts speaks with authority and its always applauded. this is going to be very backhanded and likely downvoted but i want to say that my experience thus far working within the healthcare field is that there are two types of experts. the type that is essentially a cog to the information available. the other type is the seekers of new information who never rule out the possibility. they imo and my experience are the better doctors. not just at the patient care level, but are actually more successful in treatment. there is a lot of ""stay in your lane"" attitudes inside the medical field, and as i imagine in other scientific fields. that structure has a purpose but i truly believe the greatest scientists are also philosophers. and to this moment, even from within that scientific structure, this is literally just your opinion. clearly the consensus supports it, but leave room for experiment.

"Years back I worked the overnight shift (6pm-6am). On my nights off, I maintained a nocturnal sleeping schedule. It was often boring on my nights off, because my friends and family were all asleep while I was wide awake. To relieve my boredom, I would often go for long drives on the deserted, nighttime streets. One night I noticed a pair of headlights behind me. I slowed down. They matched my speed. I soon realized it was a police vehicle. I maintained my slow speed, going about 5 miles under the speed limit, hoping he would pass me. He didn't. He continued to follow me for almost twenty minutes, turn for turn. At one point I led him in an obviously circular route, hoping he'd get the point. Finally he put his flashing lights on. I had a bad feeling in my gut. I drove for quite a distance until I found a well-lit gas station, where other people would be witness. He didn't get out of his cruiser for a long time. I figured he was running my tag. Eventually he came up to my window and shone his flashlight directly into my eyes. (This was unnecessary since it was so bright in the parking lot.) ""Yes,"" I asked. ""Why are you driving so late?"" He demanded. ""I didn't realize there was a curfew."" I responded. ""Why have you been tailing me for so long? I almost called the police *on you.* What's your badge number?"" In response, all he said was, ""It's dangerous this time of night. You be careful out here."" Then he walked back to his cruiser and drove away before I could write down his tag number. Chilled me to the bone. "

"I used to work with a figure skating coach who was 40 years old. She had horrific endometriosis. She was in the hospital all the time. So she asked to be sterilized.

There was about 4000 people in my school and I didn't know him, but he was down for a trade for the day after I begged a little. I never got my shoes back. Neither did he.

"Moved to Moncton from the GTA 7 years ago. I get the jokes about the place since I grew up in a much larger more cultured city, but Moncton has experienced a lot of change in the last 3-5 years. Keep in mind this is a city of less than 70,000 people: the restaurant scene has exploded with multicultural options everywhere. 2 Trampoline gyms, indoor rock climbing, escape rooms, live theatre, zip lining,  an artificial beach, a large arcade, a casino with a large concert venue and a new arena downtown. All that exists within city limits and most have only opened recently. I moved here out of school because I wanted to be able to afford more than a one bedroom apartment, but now it seems I'm no longer missing out on much and the perks of cheap real estate still exist as builders are keeping up with the growing population.

Addiction is much less a physical model, and much more about people who lack a basic connection to society and the people around them. You isolate people from the things that matter, be it through excessive violence, poverty, or other forms of distress, and you create addicts. You help them re-establish community, family, friends, and meaning, and they find purpose.

Tell him what it is and that it's something serious and you want him to read your letter. Then tell him you're going for a drive. Leave him alone for a few hours to process. Some dudes need time to process stuff they don't want to hear. Write the letter like it's addressed to someone else. Your mum, bff or someone. But only give it to him. 

Then when you get home a few hours later... punch him in the dick! No really talk to him and talk to him and talk to him and give him time to process.

Since nobody else is nearly that fragile, though – or is actually ""strengthened"" by hearing other perspectives – they wind up trading legitimate credibility for in-the-moment relief."

Terminator 2: Judgment Day
"I had a friend (read: crush) in highschool who had a girlfriend send him a pic of a pregnancy test and say she was pregnant and it was his.

He freaked out at first because he was like 15 or 16, but I was able to talk him down. Eventually, he actually got kind of excited. He said he was going to be a better dad than his dad was to him and so on. 

Turns out after like a month he keeps asking his gf about it and she eventually gets fed up and reveals it was fake. He spirals into a horrific depression and nearly kills himself because he feels as though the kid he was now accepting and excited for has been killed in a way (metaphorically). She got upset because he was ""supposed to get mad and scared"" and she was trying to get back at him for something petty.

Eventually he snaps back and continues dating her and becomes convinced it was his fault for getting his hopes up about it. And me trying to tell him hey no that's horrible that she did that especially for that reason was just me trying to get him to break up with her because I was jealous. Which was true. But I also saw how fucked up of a thing that is to do to someone. Good pussy is a hell of a drug for young guys, I suppose."

Sour cream is the easy way out.  using it in Creme Fraiche's stead will give you a sub par dish.  Its as simple as that.  I love sour cream where it is supposed to be used.  But it is absolutely not a substitute if you are supposed to use Creme Fraiche. "

* Step 2: Invent fake employees with high salaries, and set up bank accounts for them.

Invent fake contract documents if necessary. As before, the compliance folks at the payroll company either don't know enough (or don't care enough) to realize that your company is bullshit.

Not to mention there would have been no big deal cancelling dinner - another family in the group had already done so.

- then they raised the alarm to the police when they didn't have to.   Could equally have waited til morning and still gone with the intruder explanation...

"I can't think of anything that we don't speak of that won't affect our relationship, but the most damaging thing we've ever done as a couple that we never speak of is playing Monopoly. That game has been banned from our house.

I use to love playing with my siblings and friends, but my wife doesn't understand the concept that it's all about owning everything until you bankrupt the other person. She won't buy anything until she lands on exactly the things she wants so I end up owning half to three quarters of the board before she's bought her first property, then she gets mad when I won't sell her things she needs to make sets.

Only time we ever played, five years into the marriage (we're on ten now), was when her friend brought the game over and it ended with her (my wife) flipping the table and a screaming match then I spent the rest of the weekend getting trashed at my Dad's house complaining about how is it possible someone can NOT understand the concept of monopoly. It's the only serious fight we've ever had.

We decided for the good of the relationship we would never play or discuss monopoly again. But it still burns my ass to this day."

For men it's something that they have to go out and get, for women they just wait for guys to come to them and basically always have a selection to choose from.  For example tinder always seems to be a much more 'fruitful' experience for women; like you said you always have a couple of guys available to you that you can choose from at any time of your liking, while many guys struggle to even get the attention of their matches. It seems to be an endless cycle, both are causes and effect of each other. I'm not trying to say anything profound or political, just observing. 

I think it's simply a biological, evolutionary thing. Just take a look at the animal kingdom, most of the time it's the males who fight and compete with each other over the attention of the female."

Man, that's all sorts of fucked up now that I think about it.

Both Katniss in the narration and, so it seemed, Gale himself blamed him for designing the weapon that would kill her sister.

Secondly, Gale was a little axe-crazy about vengeance against the Capitol, in Katniss' eyes, so there was that factor, too. (Ninja Edit: Could be remembering that wrong, augh.)"

"I actually did something similar and, while it's great great fitting in normal stores and all, I do not enjoy the attention. Guys at my work (guys that work in the same building where I work and at the same time, but for a different company) speak mainly Spanish. My life went from exchanging silly Spanish banter to getting loads of unsolicited body comments. It just got way to sexual for my comfort level. I kinda stopped being as friendly as I used to be because of it. I don't know how to deal with that kind of attention I guess. "

"This is true. There was an unbelievable optimism about foreign policy in the 90s. Also, the economy was booming. So, it wasn't a perfect decade in many ways (computers were older, crime rate was higher, still a lack of care for the environment, there was a lot of fear of strangers, of drugs and violence, etcetera), but I miss the unbridled optimism sometimes. People really felt that their children would have more prosperous and more peaceful adult lives than they themselves had."

"There was a period of time in childhood and as an adult where dimes would fall out of my hair while washing it in the shower. Always dimes. It wasn't always consecutive showers, usually 2-3 times per week for a couple months or so before stopping. Sometimes one dime, never more than three. It nearly drove me crazy as an adult. I ripped apart my bed looking to see where they'd came from, and the entire shower as well. I'd bend over and shake my hair out, turn my pants and pockets out, do a thorough body check, only shower when I was home alone, etc.  I've never come up with an explanation. It's been a couple years since I've heard a dime plink to the floor in the shower. It's just one of the things that's so crazy I just push it out of my mind and accept I'll never understand where it came from. It almost reminds me of the coin behind the ear trick adults play on kids! "

"I'm a psychiatrist - basically my entire profession is portrayed very strangely.

Psychiatrists in TV shows are movies are either ""lay down on the couch and talk about whatever is convenient to you"" or ""you must take this medication.""  Some shows intentionally use ""the unhelpful psychiatrist"" as a plot device for a drastic decision (drug use, suicide, etc).

The show that consistently gets it wrong is Law &amp; Order or any show displaying forensic analysis/""FBI profiling"" (Lie to Me was another one)... psychiatrists are not magic brain voodoo witch doctors.  ""He cut the victim from the navel to the groin, clearly he was sexually absued.""  

We are doctors who understand the brain and body, and ask a series of questions to sort out problems and treatment approaches.

As an aside, who has it even worse are people with mental illnesses or psychiatric patients, they are ALWAYS portrayed as dangerous, unpredictable, criminal, and untrustworthy.   My entire patient roster is generally full of lovely, caring, helpful, but struggling people who are receiving medical treatment."

"165 degrees is the temperature when the bad bugs *instantly* die (well some very high threshold of them- like 99.99%- I forget the exact number). So if you get your meat that high, you can be sure its safe. However, its not like the bad bugs are just relaxing in the meat having margaritas and then just en-mass die at that temperature, they die off at lower temperatures, it just takes more time for the same effect. So the more complicated truth is that its actually a time/temperature *curve*, but that is a lot harder to explain so the FDA/CDC say ""165!"" so they don't have to explain the math and can be done with it and everyone has a nice easy number to remember.

However, you can see the actual curve here: http://www.cookingissues.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/bacteria_time_temperature2.jpg

So- if you hold a piece of chicken at 145 for 5 minutes, it will be just as safe as chicken at 165 for a moment. This is why sous vide works as well and is safe. "

THEN her mother bought her a condo. Rather than move in, the woman and her husband remained with her parents and rented out the condo. Then they used those proceeds to buy another rental. So between the salary from her job, her husband's job, the income from two rental properties and the money saved from having no rent or mortgage this woman was able to eventually make $10,000 payments per month on her student loans.

It was conceivable that the Germans would be able to hold for at least a few months longer, and losing the industry, infrastructure and resources of Dresden, which was Germany's seventh largest city and more important than often claimed, meant it would be that much harder for Germany to hold.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1945-02-15GerWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg) is a map of the combined Allied offensives, at the time of the bombing. Rose is what the allies hold, Red is where the current offensives were taking place.

Bombing Dresden meant it would be much more difficult to move troops and materiel from Southern Germany &amp; Austria, as well as destroying some important industry still in use, which meant the Soviet offensive would have a much easier time, thus ending the war faster.

------

Yes, it was horrific. I in no way condone mass bombing of civilians, and I'm pretty firmly anti-war in most situations, but this was a legitimate military action.

Also, civilians weren't targeted, it was night bombing on industry and other targets dispersed throughout residential areas. 

That is inherently extremely inaccurate inherently, and Joseph Goebbels used that to create a major propaganda victory, by turning 25,000 casualties into 'at least 200,000, as many as 500,000', thus creating the popular warcrime narrative.

Also, no one ever mentions the Bombing of Tokyo, a less important city, which killed five times as many civilians as the bombing of Dresden..."

"Guy flew down to Houston for an internal interview (meaning a new position at the company he already works for).  Interview goes very well.  Afterwards he goes out to ""lunch"" on the company dime and then flies home.  He submitted an expense report for this lunch, as well as his flights, rental car, etc.  This is all very standard. 

Until the interviewer (who is the one to approve said expense report) sees he listed ""Mary's Steakhouse"". It is supposedly in the area but she has never heard of this restaurant where her potential new employee racked up a $150 lunch tab.  So she googles it.

"I work at a restaurant on Wall Street so, the clientele is ALL business. Keep that in mind. 

Mom comes in with her son and her friend and the host seats them on the main level next to the bar which, as we later found out, was a huge mistake. The kid, I would say is around 8 or 9, is running around everywhere. He's going up to different tables and bothering guests. He's throwing his silverware on the floor. He pushed his mother's wine glass on her, manager rushed with napkins to help, and the kid starts tearing up the napkins and throwing them everywhere. We have a bowl full of candy and he took mostly all of the candy and unwrapped them, throwing the wrappers around, and just leaving the candy on the table. MEANWHILE. MOM. AND. FRIEND. ARE. LAUGHING. The kid was SO RUDE to everyone: server, host, manager, mom, mom's friend. No respect for anyone. He was yelling at everyone. When he threw all the candy on the floor and the mom continued to drink and laugh, I slowly began to realize that this is how serial killers are raised (my favorite murder taught me well)

I highly recommend /r/keto. I've gone up and down a bit with other diets in the past and never stuck with them. I've been doing keto since January and I'm down 70 pounds so far and that's with hardly any exercise. It's been much easier for me to sustain long term than other diets. 
"When my husband is done eating he will give me his plate instead of putting it away, or set it down next to me til I am finished for me to put away for him. 

Used to bother me. Sometimes if I'm tired or having a bad day I'll ask him to do it and he will but for the most part I don't mind. It's been three years and hasn't stopped. He does a lot for me, like even though I am perfectly capable of it, I make him put air in my tires and do all my car maintenance and he cleans more than I do. 

And if this worst thing about him is he doesn't put his dishes up after eating, I think I can manage that. "

I am an ugly girl and I knew up front, I was going to have to work a little harder to find a guy. I didn't have high standards. I just wanted someone who loved me and was kind and caring.  I met someone in WoW and we were talking about dating long before we had even seen a picture of each other.

"The electric car itself isn't bad, it's just that theoretically the electricity you take off the grid could still becoming from a dirty fuel source.

Thing is though, it can also becoming from a renewable source. The car is no longer the issue; it can take green or dirty energy. A car that runs on gas isn't going to suddenly take a different kind of petrol and be eco-friendly. It uses gasoline. It's going to keep polluting.

Electric cars remove cars from the equation of ""we have to go fix that issue too"" and focus it onto ""okay now we need to generate this power in a clean way"". And then boom, your cars are no longer a problem, and neither is your power generation."
"My father was a banker in the 70's and 80's. Back in the late 70's he started working at a bank called Citizens Federal who specialized in staying open until 7pm. Needless to say their deposits shot up dramatically so I always found it odd that other banks didn't follow suit.

It was during a lull in the conversation, and it just felt not genuine and like he oddly wanted me to know about the situation.

"Not nearly as bad as that but I bought a $75 case of poker chips when I was in college which I would let my roommates use whenever they wanted as long as they put them back when they were done. We had a Sunday night poker game that I always showed up late to because they always wanted to start while I was at a hockey game. I got back one time and they were just chilling in the apartment so I figured no poker game that night. 

The next week when I wanted to play poker I couldn't find the chips, so I asked them about it to which they explained that they went and played in the apartment clubhouse but thought someone else would bring the chips back, because I guess every time we played in the clubhouse it always me that brought them back at the end of the night. So I went to the clubhouse to look for the chips and they were gone. Bastards just lost my expensive poker chips and didn't offer to replace them. "

"The scene is worse because her pained expression and beaten posture is actually shown as she's carried out. In contrast Tarantino treats castration sorta like it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon (much like we treat most male sexual torture on screen).

I think the *Game of Thrones* story arch for Theon Greyjoy (Theon No-joy is more like it) is probably the most realistic depiction of the psychological devastation of having that cut away.

"I will say the 2nd point can sometimes be grey. I've seen that different people weigh different tasks as having different values. So one person may feel like they're doing all the work cooking and cleaning, but may ignore that the other is keeping the kids occupied and out of their way so that they can do those things. Or if one of them values the appearance of the lawn more than the other, they may become aggervated that the yard isn't mowed as often as they feel it should be, like their partner is slacking, but their partner may be more concerned with other tasks they see as more important than the yard.

It's something that, like your first point said, requires communication but is over looked a lot because people come to just expect these little things to be done, rather than appreciating their partner's efforts."

"I had four room mates in college, a different one every single semester. 

The first one killed a dude. He got high and ran over an old man. He went to jail for awhile, came back to school like nothing happened. He told me while we were in the dorms just hanging out ""uh, I killed a guy"". Eventually the police took him away. I had an empty room after that for 2 months. 

Second guy said he was majoring in ""Yardwork management"", which I think he meant something like-- I don't know, business or something. There's no such thing. I told him why would you go to college for ""yard work management"" and he said, well, in today's economy you have to be competitive. He dropped out the next semester and started a yardwork company. 

The third guy holy SHIT.

This was 2008 so WoW was still a HUGE deal (this is pre/during lich king), and this dude was BALLS OUT addicted to it. He did not even own a fucking toothbrush, he did not bathe, he would eat a whole entire pizza and a 2 litre of mountain dew (this is not an exaggeration) every single day. He was also a heavy smoker, he stank so fucking bad by the middle of the semester you could smell my room from the lobby if you were near the elevator. We had like counselors come in, all these people to try and get him to at least take a fucking bath which he finally would do after enough people complained. 

Since he never left the room and basically knew he was getting kicked out he just double committed. He started having a lot of phone sex (while I was in the room) jerking off into mountain dew bottles (while I was in the room)  good lord it just goes on and on and on. 

Me and some of my floor mates tried a campaign to make him go crazy, I installed a thinkgeek annoyotron under his bed. a tiny chip board that makes a small beep randomly every 5-30 seconds. He broke his speakers apart looking for the sound while I was in class but by the next day he just got enormous headphones and stopped caring about it. At least he didn't play with the speakers on anymore. We demagnetized his school food card about 10 times, he just stole food. We did all sorts of shit and all it did was nothing. 

He was into smearing shit on his body which we knew because he would go to the bathroom occasionally while having phone sex and talk to the people on the phone about how he was smearing shit on his body while he smeared shit on his body. He would stay up playing WoW for 2-3 days, sleep for a whole one, then do it all over. 

He did, as predicted, drop out/get kicked out the end of that semester. Now he's a police officer in my hometown (also not a joke). 


My fourth room mate was dope as shit and we're still super good friends.


Later, when I had an apartment, I had this bulging fuck of a dude named Bret with one t I lived with, he was on anti-psychotics he would frequently quit taking and he would steal peoples bicycles and take them apart in the house and just throw the pieces all over the place. He would invite strangers he met out in the home depot parking lot (his choice of place to loiter) over and give them his pills and whatever. I put a lock on my room but they would steal his stuff over and over and over. He was a food hoarder and would hide fast food all over the place. Taco bell from eight months ago under couch, bet you can't guess what kind of smell THAT makes.

Since it was a freshman class, the prof's TA took attendance by assigning us seats on the first day (before I knew about the lefty desks). Cue me struggling with the righty desk the whole semester. 

But the worst part was that to my right sat a very large woman who would spill over onto my desk. So I couldn't lean my body over my righty desk to write with my left hand. I ended both the midterm and the final with a very sore arm from writing in my blue book at a very odd angle for two hours. "

"Since I've got downvotes: [telephone exchange names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange_names) were phased out by the 1960s.  While telephone exchange names were still being used, any time you heard a word followed by five digits, you took the first two letters of the word, converted them to numbers, and treated the whole thing as a phone number.  (Fewer than five digits were used in certain places at certain times as well.)

Pennsylvania Six-Five Thousand, as immortalized in the 1940 Glenn Miller song, therefore refers to the phone number PE6-5000, or 736-5000, which (in the 212 area code) is **still** the phone number of Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City."

"Add a little vitamin C to the mix and non-heme iron absorption goes way up.  Of course, conversely, calcium for some reason drops non-heme iron bioavailability even further.  Tea-drinking can also negatively impact non-heme iron absorption.

The safest bet is, if you're looking to specifically enrich your dietary iron intake from plant sources, to combine iron-rich ingredients with low-calcium/high-vitamin-C ingredients, and avoid washing that meal down with tea.

Also, you can skip the ingredient part entirely and do some degree of preparation in cast iron cookware.  Though if you prepare something overly acidic, you run the risk of actually over-enriching the dish with iron.

It's a delicate balance.  You can have too much iron in your system, which can result in serious medical complications - and it's much more serious if you're predisposed to iron accumulation in vital organs, such as folks with hemochromatosis."

"Sorry, but that's probably just a built in defense mechanism we have since there are a lot of people who only want us as a secret fetish.

"I am a drug addict and part of my getting high has led me to believe that I am inside of a computer and everyone else I am interacting with is a robot.

I also feel like media, especially Netflix has a program running on in that works kind of like the Fantasy Game from Ender's Game and acts as a sort of reflection on your mind.  I see all sorts of things in movies and TV shows that I am watching that seems to mimic or interpret events that are going on in my life."

Falling into a moulin (glacier well). You get stuck at some point when your chest is bigger than the diameter of the well. As you breathe out you slip a bit further in and the water is slowly rising around you. Gave me nightmares when I heard about this the first time. 
"This inconsiderate mother was with her three kids in the movie theater and they wouldn't shut the fuck up. About halfway through I asked her if she could make her kids be quiet, which she hadn't tried to do at all, and she said, ""what do you want from me, they're kids."" Are you serious? There were a bunch of other children in the same theater not making any noise because their parents actually gave a shit. These kids weren't like 3 either, they were probably 7-11 years old. "
"So, I'm guessing you're American? This remark is something I hear very often from Americans because they just don't know how to use a roundabout.

Roundabouts are awesome and the rules are always straightforward. Traffic always keeps flowing (and does not cross each-other) and accidents that do happen are much less damaging due to how traffic moves on to a roundabout.

"I used to go to this greasy ass pizza place because it was next to a bar I really liked. The pizza was terrible. It was always cold. If you walked in, you could get a couple slices from under the rotating heat lamp that were clearly stale. The salads were pretty good, oddly.

"One time I got high as fuck on cough medicine. While waiting for the high to kick in I get a call from a telemarketer. I figured fuck it why not talk to this person while I wait for the high to kick in. Take a 45 minute survey about radio, television, and entertainment purchases. High as a goddamn moose about 25 minutes in naming 12 different radio stations by name and dial. Survey person compliments me on my excellent memory. He seemed really grateful to actually get somebody to complete the whole survey over the phone with him.

Two weeks later I get $5.00 dollars cash money in the mail for taking the survey with another survey to take and send back to them. Another two weeks pass and I get $10.00 dollars cash money in the mail for completing the full survey. I buy a bag of weed and look back on my accomplishments while smoking some shit to the face.

"That's crazy. In what world is that better than the map showing my location in real time? If you are going to read a novel then yes a print edition is nice since reading page after page on a screen hurts the eyes and there is something about actually holding the book is nice for some reason.

But if all I need is information then the Internet is better, it's constantly updated and contains more content than any library on Earth. And it'd indexed and searchable, so even with all that content to search through its still easier to find relevant stuff.

Edit: I came off a little salty, so I changed some wording."

It was over 25 years ago and I don't think I've ever shared this story before. After I wrote this I realized that I'm older now than he ever was... in my lifetime I've known great sadness and depression but obligations have always prevented me from taking drastic measures. He knew his death would affect hundreds of kids but he did it anyway. I can only imagine the mix of sadness and self loathing he felt knowing that. I wish he could have known how much of an impact he had on me.

"I lose my shit whenever someone tries to use 1984 to promote their political narrative. I swear, everyone does it, from democrats to libertarians to conservatives to green party members and even the fucking communist party. No, it's not ""happening today"" or ""getting closer"" in any form. The political learning of The Party is ambiguous and you can't just compare it to people you disagree with. Hell, I hate Trump and wish he'd bite off his own dick, but he and his policies have nothing to do with 1984 or O'Brien or The Party. Go to North Korea or Stalin's USSR if you want something even *vaguely* resembling 1984. 

I *always* leave a comment whenever I see someone making this comparison."
"It's those little, inane things. Like if I'm trying to put something in a bag and it falls out and I have to bend over to pick it up, it's like, why the fuck?

"When I was 14, I met this boy in a Yahoo chatroom who lived 3 states away from me. We started ""dating"" online and I really liked him. Of course, we drifted apart after a year or so of talking. 

6 years later, we reconnected on Facebook and decided to finally meet in person since we were adults and could do what we wanted. He drove down to my state and stayed 3 days. We had a good time and decided to date long distance again. After a week, we said fuck it and he quit his job and moved in with me. We had a child, he got hooked on drugs, and I dumped him and he moved back to his home state. 

It is now 7 years later we are both happily married to other people. He has another son and a daughter, while I just have our one son. He is in the process of signing over his rights so my husband can adopt our son. There's no bad blood between us and we both agree that this is the best thing for everyone. "
I've tried talking to them about it but it doesn't seem to sink in that it's creating pressure. I've told my mom plain and simple that I am not financially able to support a kid right now. After all I still live at home (moved back home).

"Sure, 

She was cheating on my with one of her old friends, and that friends boyfriend, I picked her up from Her friends house after they had a night out, friend stayed in town. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

But on the way home she admitted she's been being sleeping with both of them, separately and together for over a month. We had been together about a year at this point. Before I could get a word in she was having a breakdown and then tried to wrestle the steering wheel away from me at around 70moh. force me into the barrier Etc,

Managed to pulled the car over, throw her out after a struggle, she smashed my glasses off y face. Left her in the middle of nowhere and that's the last I heard Of that. Got an apology text from her month but ignored it.  don't like anyone I don't fully trust (basically family and my lifelong best friend) in my car anymore. "

"""I do the job, and then I get paid.""

For me, work is a necessary evil. I don't really care about money but I need it to live. Work is how you get money, so I suppose I'll work for it. But that's it. I have no connection to the work I do, I don't see a greater purpose in my work, I am not making the world a better place through my work. So all work that I am not getting paid for is a waste of my time, which I value a hell of a lot more.

I also noticed that if you are clear about that to a company, they usually respect it. It's not that they target suckers to work unpaid overtime etc. but it's more that they try to see what you do and if you don't say no, they just keep piling it on. If you are very clear from the start you will not work beyond the scope of your contract, you either get fired or they won't push it. If you're desperate to keep your job however, you're fucked."

"I have actually started doing this. When I first moved in she claimed that she was allergic to cinnamon and that we couldn't have cinnamon in the house. Later it came out that she just didn't like the smell, so I've started adding cinnamon to everything I can. I put cinnamon in protein shakes, I put cinnamon on toast, I even put cinnamon in spaghetti bolognese (worth a try, seriously). "
"When I was about ten, I was in Cub Scouts, and also suffering from sports-related head trauma, which I received via a baseball to the head about two years prior. My injuries lead to seizures, which which put a damper on what I was allowed to do in Scouts.

One Summer, after day camp, my scout den and I went to my den leader's house. We youths decided to play in the back yard, where there was a perfect climbing tree. I knew I wasn't allowed to climb trees, but everybody looked like they were having such a good time up there, so I eventually joined.

I woke up several minutes later in my den leader's arms. I, of course, had a seizure in the tree and fell eighteen to the ground. The real bullet that was dodged, though, was in my landing. Right where I hit the ground was a log, which had been cut into three pieces. One was moved, and as luck would have it, it was the middle one. I fit into its spot like a puzzle piece, and if I had fallen just a foot or inch to the right or left, I would have punctured a lung, been paralyzed, or died. But miraculously, I walked away with only a broken arm.

Coincidentally, that was the last seizure I ever had, and I'm proud to say that I've made a complete recovery. I had my Eagle Court of Honor yesterday and I'm going to college in just a few weeks. "

"I was watching that ""decades"" series not long ago (The Sixties, The Seventies, and The Eighties), and it's really remarkable how much terrorism there was in the 1970s. Every time you turned around, there was another hostage situation, another plane hijacking...and the Olympics in Munich, of course. And if the terrorists didn't get you, maybe one of the prolific serial killers or mass murderers would. The homicide rate in the 1970s and 1980s was more than twice--almost three times--what it is now. 

Of course, in the 1970s, terrorists were more likely to hit political targets rather than fucking pop concerts, and they were more likely to take (and keep) hostages than to behead them."

"I used to ride a train to work. One day on the way home, a woman sits in the seat opposite of me despite the section having plenty of open seats. I have my headphones in so I don't mind. She says something, but I didn't understand her. She touches my knee to get my attention so I pull out the headphones. She says, ""Want to see what my husband did to me?"" She then takes off her sunglasses to reveal a black eye. I said something like ""That's awful,  I hope you called the police."" She said ""No, I wouldn't be able to afford my house payment without him."" I felt like she was trying to ask me for money. I replied, ""Well that's too bad."" I tried to put my headphones back in when she said, ""People always say, 'That's too bad', but they wouldn't be saying that if it happened to them."" Fortunately the next train stop wasn't very far away, so I pretended to get off the train and found another empty section."

But this is what did it in for me: all the innocent, passionate, care-free love we shared was over, and wouldn't come back. Anything happy after that would be a hollow distraction for me until the thought of them together came back. Not to mention the trust issues and jealousy and constant worry. It's just. not. worth it.

Also, when I go home, which isn't often, the people at the 711 always recognize me and ask where I've been. I moved away 7 years ago. Shit like that is why I exist. There is so much ugly in this world. And I'm not immune - I get salty at people, I'm low on patience, my husband drives me crazy sometimes. But at the bottom of it all? There's so much beauty in this world. It's all about looking for the good, and not living for the bad."
"I will respectfully disagree. There are many people who want kids that are unable to take care of them due to financial reasons, health reasons, time reasons or a plethora of other reasons. Wanting kids is great, but wanting kids, bringing them into this world, and not being able to properly take care of them is almost selfish to some degree.

"I don't even feel like I'm ""*doing*"" anymore, I just exist, slowly but surely aging and withering away until there's nothing left-- no accomplishments remembered by others, no love carried with friends and family. 

I haven't spoken to my father in almost a decade, and now I'm beginning to distance myself from my mother. I don't have any social media presence beyond Reddit, so I don't speak to anyone on Facebook, Instagram, etc. I don't text people, I don't call people, I don't have friends in this city, I spend all of my time in this tiny, miserable apartment except for one hour a week. 

I invested an unimaginable amount of hopes, dreams, effort, time, money, sweat, and tears into my education, and I finally graduated in December. But I haven't found anyone who will hire me. The only interview I've gotten was for a position totally unrelated to my education, and I ended up being completely unqualified and embarrassed. 

I'm poor. I cannot afford luxuries like a vehicle, healthy food, or to keep up with washing blankets and such. My health suffers-- spiritually, emotionally, physically. I've grown more and more lonely, pessimistic, bitter, and hopeless. 

I could go on and on about how badly I'm doing and the reasons for this, but I'll stop here. It's too sad to keep writing-- I try to move past this stuff in order to function-- wake up, eat, apply for jobs. 

P.S., I've oftentimes prided myself on my endurance. I've encountered and endured many hardships in my life. But for the first time, I feel like my endurance has run its course. I'm at the end of my rope, I can't wait any longer for life to get better. I've begun having very dark thoughts. "

I wouldn't think so. The response of your eyes adjusting has to do with the overall amount of light they're receiving - if only a small amount of light is present your pupils will dilate in order to capture more. But if you're just looking at a dark screen while sitting in a normally lit room there would still be enough light from the rest of your surroundings that your eyes wouldn't feel the need to adjust for it.

"It's easy to go to college if you have money.  This is what I always tried to explain to people.  When I was in college, I had to also figure out how to make a living, and paying for college every semester was a crap shoot, aside from putting me in terrible debt.  School is easy; it's life that's hard.  Rich people have the privilege of having life already taken care of for them, not just with school but in regards to anything they do.  They can make any decision, try anything, without the worry of ""how am I going to survive today?"""

My accent changes depending on my mood. If i am normal/happy i will talk like Chilean, but if i am angry i will talk like Uruguayan.
When I talk like Uruguayan i am a lot more confident and i am a lot more brave.
When I am in Chilean mode i am a little coward but i am friendlier.

TL;DR: In my Uruguayan accent i am superman, in my Chilean accent i am a little puppy.

"A while back my ex broke up with me but i still lived in her family's house for the time it took me to separate our things and pack to move home. She would spend the night at her new boyfriends most nights so she didn't have to see me. It was rough, but she had a dog that kept me company. I loved that dog a great deal. I was having a tough time dealing with the break up and she slept with me most nights. It really helped ease the pain. One night after the ex got home from work and was preparing to leave again to go to his house I heard the leash jingling and the dog jumped off the couch with me and ran to her. She was going to take the dog with her to stay at boyfriends house. 

I don't remember if I cried that night, but I probably did. "

Sometimes my mother would ""forget"". He'd just get pissed and all, but would let it go when my mother would ask if he wanted to cook the meals.

"Not too creepy but I suppose it's a good story. 😕

The night of August 13, 2010, I said bye to my mother. I can't remember if I hugged her or not, but I assumed she knew I was going out partying so I probably didn't out of guilt. The last time I ever saw my mom was at that moment. She was sitting there sorting mail. My father, who was her ex husband was asleep upstairs in the master bedroom. She had been sleeping in the guest bedroom for quite some time now. They were divorced but still in the same house probably due to my mother's religious conviction. Anyways, supposedly, that night she was going to let my dad know that she was selling the house and he would need to start looking for new living arrangements.

I got a call from my father on Sunday the 15, asking if I was with her but I told him I had been with friends all weekend. He told me he thought my mother and I had up and left to be away from him like we had done in the past. I was a bit confused but didn't think anything crazy. Me, being naive, called her and left her a message but, obviously nothing came of it. 

I was back home on Monday after partying all weekend and that's when the perspective of worry began to take effect, growing more and more intense as every moment passed. Things were very foggy and downright confusing as we filed missing persons report, umm that same day I believe. My father and I didn't technically have any beef but I was not very close to him and always had a negative view of him because of how he treated my mother. I mean, me and her were inseparable. I always told her when I got married I would buy her a house and hire someone to do everything for her. She was my best friend, so I was not in a good state being at home with my father while she was missing. It was like a dream state, or that slightly buzzed feel you get when you drink a couple beers pretty quick. Only, I wasn't relaxed, euphoric, or even happy. I was a zombie going through the motions. Things were different after that Sunday when the dust started to settle. Like part one of my life was over and a new life would begin now. This event shattered my life and my mental being.

A few days, maybe a week later her phone was found by a construction worker on the highway about 15 miles from my house. That's it. All of her belongings were in her room. Her car was in the driveway. Nothing of hers was missing, just her. Investigators suspect foul play. My father and I both went with homicide division at different times to do the whole First 48 thing; polygraph, sitting in a small room with what looked like hidden cameras or something, interviews with different officers at 3am, all of it. I was quickly taken off the suspect list while my father remains the primary person of interest in the case. According to investigators he failed the polygraph test ""miserably"". As days passed, the possibility of finding her alive diminished. A few weeks later, the case went cold. Now, we're waiting for a body to show up but what're the odds of that happening after 7 years? 

The family fell apart. I don't speak to my father or any of my siblings who live in other parts of the country. Now I live in another city alone, monitoring my anxiety and depression through my therapist. I have just a few, or maybe a couple friends? But, then we could go on about whether or not they're actually friends. In August she'll be pronounced dead. I'm still extremely confused but I think my father was involved. The January after her disappearance my uncle from my dad's side committed suicide. He always seemed to be the happiest of all six of my uncle's. Maybe he knew something? He died apologizing for something as he bled out after jumping in front of a bus. Was it for committing suicide or for the death of my mother?

"Relaying a story from a high school teacher.

He once set out a bowl like this on Halloween, and hid behind the vehicles in his drive way. He sees a little kid in a skeleton costume walk up. The kid was walking very slowly, and looking around for witnesses. He was obviously very nervous. He approaches the bowl, dumps it all in his bag, and then stands there.

The teacher comes from behind the vehicle and approaches the kid.

The kid nervously replies, ""Y-yeah.""

""And how much did you take?""

Mark Bakotic II, 21, disappeared outside of a New Orleans nightclub on December 30, 2016. 

He and his friends had been at a EDM show and had taken a fairly obscure hallucinogen called 2c-e and from all accounts the trip was not going well. Mark grew paranoid, didnt know who he was and ran away from his friends. 

He had a blotter sheet of 2c-e in his pants pocket. It stormed shortly after he ran away. The thing is when 2c-e gets wet its possible to be absorbed through the skin. Giving him a massive dose all at once.

As far as we know Mark is still wandering around new orleans somewhere. He had been spotted in the neighborhood he dissapeared in up to 3 months after he dissapeared.

The theory is that the massive dose of 2c-e he accidentally ingested caused a psychotic break and that he has no idea who he is. If he is still alive he is likely very paranoid. There is a good chance that the missing persons posters meant to help find him have chased him away from the people searching for him.

The thought of him wandering around new orleans scared, alone and not knowing who or what he is for the last 7 months terrifies me."

The delta wave device, his hand on the plunger, the Daleks saying ""What will it be, Doctor? Coward, or killer?"" ITS FUCKING GALLIFREY ALL OVER AGAIN. ITS THE SAME DAMN CHOICE. HE KNOWS ITS THE LOGICAL ONE AND HE KNOWS ITS THE ONLY WAY ANYONE SURVIVES AT ALL, AND THATS *KILLING* HIM. He just burned his entire civilization to get rid of the Daleks. To him it would seem like it was just yesterday. And now, not only did all that sacrifice mean *Nothing* because the Daleks survived, but now hes faced with the EXACT same choice all over again.

You can see it. You can see it ALL in Eccleston's face.

Watching that episode, I swear to god he, as an actor, MUST have known about all the details of the war doctor, 10 and 11 with the Moment, choosing to save Gallifrey but thinking he burned it. Watching that performance, its just *so* good and fits *So* well with what we later learn of the war doctor.

But, of course, he *didnt* know. It wasnt even written yet. His performance was just that powerful.

"A friend of mine went to a Porta-Potty after a concert. He was sitting and minding his own business when he felt **the whole toilet unit being lifted up by a forklift and loaded onto a truck.**  He started yelling and frantically pounding on the door.  He heard the engine of the forklift stop, then quickly reverse and lower the unit back down. The driver was quite apologetic for the mistake.     "
"No, actually, it was... okay, fine, I'm going to do this.

Eric was secretly dating Quinn, despite the fact that she had previously tricked Liam out of marrying Steffy (so that Wyatt could marry her instead). Their affair was discovered, and Ridge turned both the Forresters and Spencers against their relationship. Unfortunately, Eric was so enamored with Quinn that he not only married her, he also made her CEO of Forrester Creations. This obviously didn't sit well with Ridge, who hatched a scheme to gain a controlling share of the company... but Bill – who owned a sizable percentage – would only turn his stake over to Brooke, and even then, only if she agreed to marry him.

Brooke and Bill were very close to getting married, but Ridge swooped in at the last second and convinced his former wife to get back together with him. At the same time, Quinn's frequent meddling in Wyatt's love life drove Steffy to the point of divorcing him, and she wound up reconnecting with Liam. Everything looked like it was going to have a happy ending, but Ridge and Quinn – stepson and stepmother, who hated each other – wound up experiencing several sexually charged moments while designing jewelry. This ultimately culminated in them sharing several passionate kisses, and they began an illicit emotional affair behind Eric's back.

Well, this was all happening while Katie was trying to get a job at Forrester Creations, and after she caught Ridge and Quinn kissing, she used that information to blackmail Quinn and call off a destination wedding between Ridge and Brooke. This was bad news for RJ, who had recently returned to Los Angeles, and was upset to hear that his parents wouldn't be getting back together. He found solace in the arms of Coco Spectra, who had arrived with her sister, Sally, who – after attempting to sabotage Forrester Creations as a means of launching Spectra Fashions back into the spotlight – began dating Thomas. Ridge was obviously upset with this, and it left him vulnerable. He made several mistakes, and his affair was ultimately discovered by Sheila, who had arrived at the Forrester Mansion for reasons that were never adequately explained. Sheila revealed the affair to Eric, who promptly disowned his son and disavowed his wife.

That's about where we are now. Also, Caroline has come back with Douglas, and Bill (who is now married to Brooke) is trying to break up the Forrester-Spectra romance so that Thomas will reconnect with his former lover.

"I must have even distribution on/in my food. I frequently open up my sandwiches, burgers, tacos, etc. in order to rearrange what's inside. I pick toppings off of pizza and rearrange them accordingly for even coverage and distribution. If I'm eating soup, a salad, a scramble / omelette, or a casserole, etc. then each bite has to have at least a little bit of every component. 

I always order extra pickles for any sandwich/burger with pickles. I frequently get the comment ""Wow you really like pickles!"" ...no, it's just that when I want a topping on my food it's with the intention of having said topping in every bite. Why do I only get 2-3 pickle slices on an entire sandwich or burger? It's not like anyone is thinking, ""Hmmm I think pickles sound great on 1/3 of my burger, but I want 2/3 of my bites with no pickle.""

"Same experience. My senior year my dads health was failing so I moved across country to take care of him. Ended up going to high school on the south side of a fairly major city in the Southwest. I'm your typical white boy with a country accent, so this subjected me to some mild and usually good natured hazing. Usually just laughed off or I'd throw some shit their way also. 

But one freshman thug wannabe couldn't handle it when I zinged him in class, so he stepped shit up. At first it was bumping into me in the halls and shit. One day he came up behind me and tried quickly taking off my necklace and I guess running away with it. I was just quick enough to get him in a mild arm bar that I didn't put much pressure on, and told him to not touch me. So now I've really embarrassed him in front of his buddies, so he starts shoving as soon as I let him go. I didn't retaliate - though I was damn close - and it's broken up in 30 seconds by a hall monitor/lunch lady. Gets reported and I'm pulled out of my next period to go talk to the principal. 

2 weeks of after school detention. Good idea principle! 2 guys that aren't getting along to the point of getting physical, so what do we do? Let's give them an extra hour a day for 2 weeks in the same room after school!

I'll give the kid credit though. Near the end of the year I was at a party that he showed up at. Came over, drunkenly apologized while saying I'm a cool dude, and we've been FB friends for a couple years now even though I moved back home a decade ago. He seems to be doing well. "

But what surprised me the most was this group I came across once, but I personally could never explain this one particular property of our planet being a sphere to them. I tried explaining with all sorts of the basic knowledge of science that our world is not and can not be a flat disc but they couldn't get their head around it.

At the end of the day it's not really a choice what you're attracted to. I, for instance, have never found myself physically attracted to a dark skinned woman.

"When I was in elementary school I was pretty advanced compared to the rest of my class, so the school thought I should skip from 3rd to 4th grade. This was 1993, so cursive was still a pretty big part of the 3rd grade english curriculum. My parents decided that I shouldn't skip the grade, but I wound up taking english class with the 4th graders as a compromise. Consequently I never formally learned to write in cursive, and my teachers allowed me to print. 

Flash forward 12 years and it's time for me to take my SAT, which requires me to copy down a legal paragraph in cursive. I told the monitor person that I didn't know how to write in cursive (I could kind of fake it in the way that your grandma combines print and cursive in your birthday cards, but not well). They told me that disqualified me from taking the SAT altogether. I wound up just doing the best I could, but yeah... cursive is dumb in this day and age. 

PS- don't teach your kid that they're very advanced/intelligent when they're young. It teaches them to not try any harder than they have to. "
"I worked at a large amusement park as an EMT, they had a solid staff of experienced mechanics who would frequently shut various rides down temporarily (I'm talking multiple times a day) at the slightest hint of an issue. They usually reopened quickly as they generally just needed to inspect it, make a tweak or yell at the ride operator. They performed routine inspections multiple times a day. It was not uncommon for them to order a ride closed for an extended period of time, and I never saw a hint of interference from management. 

 As someone else mentioned there's a strong push  from up top to avoid complaints, claims and litigation.  Plus the mechanics I worked with all took great pride in their work and were dead serious about getting it right. 

I'm positive that many amusement parks do not set the safety bar nearly as high as the place I worked. I can also say with certainty that in general, amusement parks are significantly safer than traveling carnivals. "

Eventually I get them to agree ""energy"" is the wrong word, and if something is happening here they really need to stop using the word energy if they ever want to be taken seriously. Granted the alternative is ""magic"" but people learn best when they come to the conclusion themselves and most people will drift away from pseudo-science and embrace some spiritual pseudo religion (which I'm fine with personally) if not slowly stop clinging to the faulty premise.

"This one probably won't be popular, but:

""Because I said so""

I'm not against explaining things to my kid and still hate it as a go-to explanation. But there are so many times where I've told my kids, repeatedly, why they need to do something. It goes something like:

Me: Put on your shoes, we need to leave in three minutes.

Her: &lt;Doesn't put on shoes&gt;

Me: Put on your shoes, we need to leave in two minutes.

Her: &lt;Doesn't put on shoes&gt;

Me: Put on your shoes!

Her: Why?

This one's kind of on the extreme end, as it doesn't take long to explain ""we need to leave in one minute"", but the same concept of saying ""&lt;request&gt;, &lt;reason for request&gt;"" repeatedly, then being asked ""why"" later when I repeat the request. And in hindsight, I was probably doing the same all the times my parents said ""because I said so"".

A close second is when it's blindingly obvious why I told them something, and they're smart enough to figure it out. Like telling them to gather their stuff when we're at a park and it starts to thunder. Though usually I just repeat the request in the form of a question when they do that, like:

&lt;thunders&gt;

Me: Pack up your stuff.

Her: Why?

Me: Why do you think you should pack up your stuff?

Usually she figures it out.

This is a very fair and well thought out response. Thank you. 
"Can confirm, after I got robbed outside of San Antonio, Tx, I started carrying a pistol in my vehicle. It was not concealed. I mounted a holster to the dash board. 

I got pulled over one night by a state trooper. I was doing like 71 in a 65. I pulled over, put my window down, and stuck both hands out the window. 

He approached the vehicle, I told him I had a gun in the holster. He stepped back, put his hand on his weapon and asked me if it was loaded. I replied telling him I had a full mag and one in the chamber. He said to open the door. I did. 

Then he told me to grab the weapon, point it at the passenger floorboard and disarm the gun. I took the gun out, popped out the mag, removed the one from the chamber. I handed him my gun which he took care to place on the hood of my truck, then handed him the mag and single bullet. 

After that he asked for my lic/insurance/registration. I handed him that and he looked at it and told me to slow down. He said that he was going to leave and then I could retrieve my weapon. I sat there and he drove off, then I grabbed my gun and put it back in the holster with one in the chamber. I was never really nervous. You don't need a concealed weapons permit in Louisiana to have a gun in your vehicle. Your vehicle is an extension of your house. 

I've also gotten pulled over for a burnt brake light on a utility trailer on my way to my hunting camp. The lights worked when we left, but apparently had a short. The state trooper had even noticed that the light seemed to work sometimes when hitting bumps. 

He came to my window, saw the hunting bags in the back of the truck and the rifle cases in the back seat. Asked where I was going, I told him. He asked how many guns were in the truck, I Think between the 2 of us, we had 8 or 9 guns, including rifles and pistols. He asked where we hunted, then told me to get the light fixed and to have a good hunting trip.

My favorite way to explain Houston is ""it's a great place to live and a terrible place to visit.""

I'm a huge advocate of Houston. Born and raised, UH educated, stayed for a couple years post-college, am now in NYC. I miss Houston in some way every single day.

It's a swamp literally beat into feigned submission and could kill us all at any moment, but it's beautiful and it's feisty and it's home. 

It's overtaken NYC as the most diverse city in the nation. 

If Greater Houston were a country, it would rank fourth in the world for refugee resettlement.

Traffic is bad, yes, but Houston is home to the widest freeway in the world. At one point, I10 stretches out to 28 lanes, if you include both east/west directions and the feeders. The public transport sucks, but trust me, you'll want to invest in a car if you don't have one already [in a city like this](http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/as-if-you-needed-it-further-proof-that-houston-is-so-much-bigger-than-most-cities/).

Houston's cost of living is like, nothing.

Houston has the most Fortune 500 companies outside of NYC.

Energy Capital of the World, Space City, Screwston. Nicknames happen for a reason.

Houston has the largest rodeo in the world.

Houston is (non)surprisingly Democratic, making headlines when we nonchalantly elected a lesbian mayor with Annise Parker and ""the world was surprised, while Houston was surprised the world was surprised.""

And Houston is home to the best and largest medical center in the world, not only making Houston the premier destination for medical care, but a hotbed for HOT DOCS. 
&gt; The Texas Medical Center contains 54 medicine-related institutions, with 21 hospitals and eight specialty institutions, eight academic and research institutions, four medical schools, seven nursing schools, three public health organizations, 2 pharmacy schools and a dental school.

&gt; More heart surgeries are performed in Texas Medical Center than anywhere else in the world with 13,600 heart surgeries annually. 180,000 annual surgeries are performed. The TMC performs 1 surgery every 3 minutes. Over 25,000 babies are delivered each year, more than 1 baby every 20 minutes. The Texas Medical Center offers over 9,200 total patient beds.

&gt; The Texas Medical Center receives an average of 3,300 patient visits a day and over eight million annual patient visits, including over 18,000 international patients. The TMC has over 750,000 ER visitors each year. In 2011, the center employed over 106,000 people, including 20,000 physicians, scientists, researchers and other advanced degree professionals in the life sciences.[6] The Texas Medical center has over 160,000 people visit each day.

&gt; The Texas Medical Center is home to the largest children's hospital in the world (Texas Children's Hospital), as well as home to the largest cancer hospital in the world (MD Anderson Cancer Center).

[Bonus fun quote](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CG3uQkHU8AE8Wo2.jpg)

Houston is a rough and tumble bitch who isn't going to make it easy for you, and that's half the appeal. If someone from Houston tells you how terrible Houston is, it's out of love. If someone from Dallas tells you how terrible Houston is, it's because they suck.

"That's only if you're well adjusted with your peers. There's a lot of kids who get bullied or feel like they don't belong, or feel like they are 'too mature for their age'. 

I didn't have any kids my age around me till I went to first grade and I was the only child for both sides of my family, so I was given so much attention by the adults, and I read ahead and knew more than my classmates as a result. Add to this bullying and chronic asthma so I couldn't run and play. So I wouldn't have thought twice about hanging out with a teacher after school. 

I imagine there's a lot of kids like me. "
"Never. And here's why:

All units were designed to be usefull in certain situations. grams, centimeters, newtons, meters, kilograms, liters were designed to be easy to do physics and chemistry with. And they are. So most US schools teach science classes in metric. 

Feet, Inches, Yards, and Miles were made to be easy to estimate, measure and construct. If I need to know how far something is, I can pace it out to yards(ik ik meters are basically the same). 

A yard is 36 inches, or 3 feet. From there I can divide 36 by 2,3,4,6,9, or 12 and end up with a whole number. If I tried to do the same with 1 meter, or 100 centimeters, I'd need to delve into decimals to divide. Even an inch is usually divided into 16, so you can divide by 2 or 4 or 8.

Oz. Cups, Pints, Teaspoons and Tablespoons and such were designed to be easy to cook with. And they are! Much easier than trying to do decimal calculations with milliliters. 

All units should be used for what they were designed for. Metric length/wieght/energy/mass = physics

Imperial length/area (acres) = construction/surveying

Imperial Volume = cooking

Temperature= Celsius/Kelvin for science,

Fahrenheit for weather (0 is really cold, 100 is really hot, 50 is mild, its easy to remember, and has more of a range than using Celsius for weather.)

Look at nautical units. I don't really know what a Knot is, but I'm sure that whoever decided to use it had a reason, and it was better than using MPH.

Look at the Astronomical Unit, or AU. It is the distance between earth and the sun. It is great for describing how far away planets are from each other. It was based off a random and arbitrary distance, much like feet or inches or pounds. It is terrible for gas mileage. I get .0000000001AU per gallon. Well that is useless to me, because regular distances are not measured in AU.

TL;DR Use units for the purposes they were created for, don't push one system for all purposes, because chances are there is a better unit for that."

"Jamaica is not as bad as this person is describing. 

The key is knowing that it is a very poor country and that you should have some way of vetting who you choose to render services. The same is true if you visit places in the south pacific. If you go, plan on staying in at one of the nicer resorts (still pretty cheap by American standards). 

Many resorts have true private beaches. However, some are public (Negril was when I was there, not sure if it still is). Also, I've never been hounded too much at any public beach in the main tourist towns (Ochi, Mobay, or Negril).

I've been multiple times and only had a few minor annoyances (all off resort). This is going to sound really touristy... but check trip advisor before you book and check it regularly before you go. There will be good feedback and suggestions there.

All of that said, if you are uncomfortable with the risk and or poverty. Check out some of the other Caribbean Islands. If I'm spending slightly more money, I like Turks &amp; Caicos and Bahamas (the remote islands are best) for a closer trip or Antigua / Barbados in the West Indies. There are also some expensive island experiences but most people will feel a bit off-put by those as well (think high end Vegas)."

"Not sure how or if I fit here.  After identifying as exclusively gay for a number of years I ""fell"" for a female friend of mine.  This opened my eyes to see women in a way I hadn't since I was an early teen doing what I was supposed to by going on dates with girls.  There were two girls I had major crushes on but the first rejected me and the second I was too scared to ever approach after one date.  After this guys would talk to me online and would pursue me.  Being shy and not real good at pursuing, I decided I was gay and that was that for years.. until my last semester of college.  I fell for the female friend and my world changed... in a lot of ways.  

I realized that I don't lust after women the way I lusted after men.  Either something innate or the way I was raised; women are to be respected and not looked at a certain way until marriage.  

I realized I have to really get to know and love a woman before I can get intimate, otherwise I just don't have the connection to go further.

I dated a lot soon after this realization and decided to be celibate until I found ""the one"".  I found out that I stress out a lot more with women because I don't want to be the one rejecting after feeling the rejection myself.  I also found that it was difficult to date as a celibate man when the woman really wanted to have sex.  I didn't like that pressure either.  

I'm slow to warm up to people and generally like my own space and am kinda stubborn about my routines.  After a few years of trying dating I got overwhelmed with putting myself out there so much and either being rejected or feeling like shit for rejecting another.  I can deal with my own rejection.  But have trouble with making someone else feel that way.  

So over the past few years I just haven't dated.  I got a dog (she is awesome, but I realize I don't really like having a pet either).  

My friends worry about me and think I need to get laid, but I have no desire to date men anymore and I'm really over doing anything online and don't really get out to places to meet a woman who I think would mesh with me.

I think I've become more closed off recently than ever before in my life.  I stick with a sad routine of work, WoW, Netflix, and doing a little working out a few times a week... sometimes.  

I sometimes think I'm depressed but then I go for a jog or smoke a bowl or say a prayer and I feel better.  Sometimes I think I'm just a loser who needs to get the hell over myself.  But then I freeze and continue to feel stuck.  Then I pet my dog and think it's probably good for me to have a pet.

Besides that, I'm doing well in life.  I have a great job.  I'm fitter than I've ever been.  I have great friends.  And I only feel bad about being a ""virgin"" when I think of the 40 year old virgin movie...  will I be 40 and still single?  Am I that guy who is just too stubborn to let some else in?  Too afraid of being rejected by a woman again or having to reject her?  

It was much easier with guys to an extent... but I'm just not interested anymore.  

Btw I'm 34 male living in Austin,TX.  Yee Haw

Edit:  been with dudes, but never with a woman and have been celibate seven years since realizing I'm not interested in anything long term with a guy and don't want to have anything casual with anyone.  Overall I am happy with this and have peace of mind, but there are times I feel like a loser and am discontent and get grumpy about my current state of being.  "

"Absolutely. Don't misunderstand, I'm not anti-porn by any means. But when you spend years watching pornography without developing any real interpersonal sexual relationships, it can have a pretty damaging effect on how you view potential sexual partners. 

I spent around 15 years without a significant sexual partner. During that time I substituted the lack of real physical and emotional contact with pornography. When I finally found myself in a sexual relationship with a person that I cared about, I found the sexual aspect of our relationship to be extremely difficult at first. Not because I couldn't fulfill myself, but because I couldn't bring myself to objectify her in the same was as I'd objectified these anonymous women I used to stare at online.  
  
It's worth noting that my partner is a *freak* and the stumbling block was certainly not related to not certain acts being prohibited in the bedroom! 
On the contrary, I felt like I was being disrespectful to her by regarding her in the same fashion as the individuals in the videos I used to regularly watch. 

Porn is awesome. Just make sure that overexposure doesn't fuck with your perspective."

I was raised by crack whores and skinny joes and they taught me how to take dirt baths and steal pocket books off the street. It was catlike training and I'll never forget the day they built an Applebees next door and it burnt down in a money laundering scheme, burning the estate down with it. They all perished in the fire.

"My original story happened right around 1989-1990 or so.   Like I said, it was piss-easy to live on welfare at the time by just pumping out kids.  Stories like yours (and my original story) were pretty commonplace at the time around here.   The projects had their own little society and ecosystem where they all knew the going ""foodstamp to cash"" ratio, there were tips on how to make sure you were meeting what few requirements there were to stay on welfare and how to beat the system, which case workers were the ""best"" and how to have your caseworker changed in order to get one you liked, etc.  Teenage pregnancies were treated as ""no big thing"" and were just considered a rite of passage.  In fact, a pregnant girl who was too young to live on her own even if she wanted to meant that the *mother* got a few extra years of welfare without having to even pump out another kid.  

These days, the rules and limitations are more strict and it's somewhat harder to turn the system into a multi-generation lifestyle, but there are still some ""old timers"" there that still know how to game the system and brag that they haven't had a job in 20-30 years.  Of course now, they all suffer from ""chronic depression"", ""anxiety"", and ""back problems"" that all seemed to develop when welfare reforms kicked in.  Funny how that worked....

And keep in mind.....I am a strong supporter of social safety net systems such as welfare, as I have known plenty of people who fell upon hard times through no fault of their own and needed a hand for a few months.  It's just annoying to see what should be a temporary safety net abused by people who try to turn it into a lifestyle simply out of laziness or an overblown sense of entitlement, while tarnishing the reputations, stigmatizing, and taking away valuable and limited resources from those who have a legitimate need.

"They probably also weren't taught to not inconvenience people, honestly. I can get pretty stuck in my own head sometimes but ever since I was a little kid *someone*, be it my parents, friends, or someone else, would call me out on it (and sometimes physically pull me away from accidentally being a jackass). Now it's just such a habit I don't even think about it so I can ruminate on whatever is going through my head without being a pain. I can easily see how someone like me who wasn't taught that could just not see it when they have a line of thought demanding their attention.

"While thsi is true, I can tell you that from my work in the court system, that it's outside of about that first standard deviation where it starts to matter.

You're not brilliant, and if you're at the lower end maybe you have to work a little harder to learn things, but you're still capable of doing it.   You're right in the fat part of the bell curve.   Plenty of people from 115 to 130 are still unsuccessful because of lack of effort. 

When you get into the second standard deviation on the bottom end. 70-85 is where people really start struggling.  At the lower end of that scale is where you qualify for disability because it's going to be difficult to get by on your own without some help.

It doesn't feel like the story is ever actually central to the film, if that makes sense."

"One time I was camping with a friend and we stayed up drinking and smoking. The campsite was at the back of a pub in the middle of nowhere. You could hear the traffic on the nearby road but there was less and less as the night wore on.

Around 3 in the morning we heard this huge rumbling sound in the distance. It was like a jet engine but at ground level. Realising it was getting closer we both ran round the side of the pub to the road. By this point the noise was ridiculous.

And then it appeared and shot past us at like 200 mph. And it was shiny and black and really long - like 60 feet or something. It had a pointed nose and was roughly missile shaped. My friend said he saw windows running all down the side. After it passed we saw the back of it and it had what I can only describe as sci-fi rocket thrusters.

We limped back to our tents feeling extremely freaked out... "

"Leftovers.

ME:

They are to be eaten within the next 24 hours or disposed of.

They should be transferred into air-tight containers and put in the fridge.

Under no circumstances, should there be more than one different type of leftover in the fridge at one time.

If you decide to cook and there are leftovers, you have implied that they are inedible and you should dispose of them.

If you're enough of a barbarian to put the leftovers in a dish, rather than a plastic container, then you should at least cover it with saran wrap. 

HER:

Anything goes. You can put uncovered dishes of food, anywhere in the kitchen to eat within the next 48 hours. (food poisoning is a myth) You can fill 85% of the fridge with unidentifiable bowls of crap and leave it there until the next ice age. If you cook in a pan, it's normal and acceptable to just put the pan in the fridge and use it as a leftover container.

Then ... don't see him in the living room for a month.  Other roommate and I re-arrange the furniture, and the next day there he is, in the living room, calling the landlord to complain we'd movd the loveseat.

Another month, and I see a letter from my mother in the mailbox (he had the only key to the mailbox, would leave mail on the kitchen table).  Letter disappeared from letterbox, but doesn't appear.

"Just make sure you find somebody who's not insecure. If you both have dealt with your insecurities that line about jealous existing in small amounts can go, too. I used to be terribly insecure when I was younger. And I acted like a dick, being jealous and suspicious all the time. Fast forward 20 years, I've gotten over those things, and I realize that if I just take care of my SO and keep her completely happy, I don't have to be jealous of anybody. I know she'd be a fool to mess around, and I know she's not. But even if she did, I know it's not my fault because I did everything I could to make her happy. So it basically makes jealousy moot.

"When I was young, my mother's job was taking care of the house and the kids, but my dad was still giving her a salary for being his ""secretary"" as he had his own company. Basically my dad paid my mom to take care of me and my brothers/sister. When they separated (not divorced since they were never married), my dad kept giving my mom a salary and he still let her live in his house (it was in his name). My dad was often out of town for his work so it my mom stayed in the house when he was gone and they took an appartment in the city together that they could both use whenever they didnt have the kids. Now almost 15 years later, my mother still lives in my dad house, was still getting paid by my dad until he retired recently and they have a marvelous relation.

I didnt realise when they separated how mature they were for keeping a decent relation for all their children. Since they were not married, nothing could have stopped my dad from screwing my mom and kicking her out jobless, but he kept supporting her all those years when she needed it. Everytime i tell their story, people find it weird. 1 months ago we had a dinner where it was my dad, my mom, my half-brother and sister mom, my current dad gf and his six childrens all around the table. We jokingly said my dad was with his 3 wives and childrens."

""What the fuck is a key check?""

""You know, how any time you're out, your parents ask to see your house key, and if you don't have it, you get in trouble?""

Apparently, that's not a thing.  I got my first house key when I was 6, and from that point on, my dad would sometimes just say, ""Show me your key,"" and if I didn't have it, I'd be grounded for 2 weeks.  Of course, I got grounded for anything and everything. "

(1). ""Corporations can donate tons of money to political candidates.""

In reality, corporations cannot donate any amount of money to candidates or their campaigns. What is often reported in shorthand as ""donations from Harvard"" are actually donations from employees of Harvard which are aggregated by open secrets to be ""from"" the employer.

Same thing with industries.

(2). ""If the government just treated electronic documents like physical ones, they wouldn't be able to search our emails/Facebook/etc..""

Sadly, no. The reason the government can get your emails from Google without a warrant is the same reason they can get your phone records from your phone company without a warrant. Information, documents, etc. given to a third-party is no longer protected by your fourth amendment rights.

(3). Almost anything starting with ""it's not copyright infringement/is fair use if I...""

There is one correct answer here: ""engage in a transformative use of a copyrighted work."" That criterion has been dispositive in more than 90% of cases in modern fair use jurisprudence.

Here are some ones that aren't:

*""I'm not claiming I made it.""* That'd be a defense (if at all) to trademark. Copyright doesn't give a shit about attribution (the DMCA does, but that's a whole other can of worms), just copying, distributing, and derivative works. Speaking of derivative works:

*""I'm not competing with any official or licensed product.""* Awesome, doesn't stop you from making a derivative work though. Copyright holders have the right to decide *not* to exploit a derivative market, that doesn't leave it open for someone else to exploit.

*""I'm not making any profit, I'm giving it away for free.""* This is wrong in both directions. Fair use is not proven by lack of revenue, nor disproven by making money. If you've transformed the work you can make money off of it. If you haven't, you're infringing even if you don't make money.

Now to end on a fun one

(5). ""OMG I'm going to pedantically correct someone who said it was assault when that dude punched the other dude, it's actually battery; assault is a threat.""

This one is half-true but mostly canard. The common-law tort of battery is contact and the tort of assault is a threat. But in criminal law it's all statutory, and it's all over the place. In my state the contact is assault, the threat is ""menacing"", and battery doesn't exist. In California battery is the contact, and assault is an *attempted* battery."

"*The road not taken* by Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

And sorry I could not travel both

And be one traveler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could

To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,

And having perhaps the better claim,

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

Though as for that the passing there

Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay

In leaves no step had trodden black.

Oh, I kept the first for another day!

Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh

Somewhere ages and ages hence:

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference."

"These subreddits are bad for you mentally because the truth is, in life sometimes you just have to get out there and cringe. If I didn't go talk to a cute girl with her headphones in on the subway (major cringe alert!) I wouldn't have met my fiancee.

You spend your time cringing at other people all the time, and you start to over-analyze everything you do, because you don't want to be cringey like them.

On the flipside, if you are genuinely non-judgmental and you try to see people in the best light, people will want to be around you. "

You cant escape it, you know it's probably already too late, but you for the gas hoping you can outrun the black tide. Unfortunately, the soot and debris is already getting sucked into your engine, and moments later the car sputters out, shuddering to a halt as your visibility decreases to a matter of feet.  The vehicle starts to smell like char and ash as the ventilation system begins to literally melt from the heat of the pyroclastic cloud.

"In January of this year, I won the chance to take a cab ride and grab some pizza with the actor Bobby Cannavale. I was home in NYC on winter break from drama school in LA and made a donation to a Syria relief fundraiser that offered the hangout as a prize. We got some slices in the West Village then sat in a park and talked about everything from acting to how one gets a girlfriend like Rose Byrne. It was a dream come true for me as he's long been an actor I look up to. In fact, it was a particular performance of his in a Broadway play that convinced me to go to college specifically for acting. It was an absolute pleasure to be able to tell him that in person. He also did his part in persuading me to move back to NYC after graduation to start my career, which I wound up doing. I do not regret it for a second."

"When I was in middle school my parents used to fight a lot. I was the oldest of three children and my brother and I went a few years having to live with my parents cursing and yelling and screaming at each other over a lot of things that I can barely remember. I think that most of the fighting centered around my mother being an incompetent deadbeat mother to three young kids and my father working very hard and then having to deal with my mom making mistakes running the house and raising her kids. Now that I'm older, I realize that both of my parents are really just loser people. My dad makes good money and we're an upper middle class family, but both of my parents come from the city and working class backgrounds and sort of city or 'street' life during the 70s and they bare a lot of inner scars from their lives before us kids were born. What this meant was that despite us living on a nice block in a great neighborhood, I never really felt like I lived in a respectable or cool family that matters to people. My dad makes the money and then a mother and her three kids live off of it. That's the way I would describe us and I would say that half of my life in my family has been dysfunctional. There have been good times and bad times together but years later I realize that this wasn't really down to my parents having a respectable or great marriage; it was mostly down to them having kids to keep them occupied and happy. 

Sometimes it wasn't enough to hold our house and family together.

When I was in 7th grade, I played CYO basketball for my parish and had practices and games every Saturday during the Winter season. At the time, the weekends were maybe the worst times to be in my house because everyone was home at once, we all had sporting events to go to, and us kids all needed to be taken care of and sometimes my parents didn't get a break and were very stressed out by it all. This led to a lot of screaming, yelling, and fighting between my parents.

This one Saturday my parents lost control of one of their fights. I was getting ready for basketball and my dad was cursing like an animal at my mom about something. I think that my mom forgot to do something or put the weight of something she had to do on my dad and he went crazy. Somehow, their fight turned towards some socks that my dad left on the floor of their room and hadn't picked up along with all of his other clothes. My dad lived like a pig and left his stuff all over his bedroom and left work stuff all over our dining room table and my parents used to fight really bad about this among other things. These fights scared me half the time when I was young and they were the type of fights and screaming matches that made you stop what you were doing and go to the top of the stairs with pain in your chest to listen to what they were fighting about. 

My mom started telling my dad to pick his socks up off of the floor and my dad started cursing at her to do it. This went on and back and forth for about thirty seconds and I got frightened by it and walked into the hallway underneath my parents' room on the floor above. The first sound I heard wasn't a sound at all. It was complete silence throughout our entire house. It lasted for about five seconds and it was the longest five seconds that I had ever lived through. Then I heard my dad stomping around his room. My mom didn't make a sound. Five seconds later, my mom let out the scariest sound I had ever heard in my life.

""ANIMAL! ANIMAL! AHHHHHHHH! ANIMAAAALLLL!""

She was screaming that over and over and over again while crying and it sounded like what I thought at the time it would sound like if someone was about to die. All the while, my dad was screaming at the top of his lungs for her to ""PICK IT UP! PICK IT UP!"" over and over and over again. By this time, my brother had come out of his room and we were both so scared that we basically were holding onto each other in some sort of terrified hug or death grip while we both screamed ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?"". When my dad stopped screaming, my mom started crying hysterically and then started crying and screaming that she wanted a divorce. The next thing she said was that ""THEY'LL NEVER FORGET THIS!"".

She was right. I never have.

I was now late for basketball practice and had no one to drive me to the gym. My little sister was napping downstairs and hadn't woken up through all of this. My brother shook a bit as he went back into his room and closed the door enough in a way so that I couldn't see him. I had no choice but to walk myself to practice in the snow and slush and cold that was left over from Thursday. It was a long and cold walk to the gym in my swishy basketball snap pants and my puffy jacket. If you've ever walked somewhere against traffic in your town, you can feel nearly every driver staring at you, whether they actually are or are not. That day I didn't feel anything. My mind was totally locked out by white noise and by trying to figure out what happened at my house. Twenty minutes later I was at the gym and made up some excuse for why I was a half hour late. I don't even remember how I got home from practice.

At the time, I thought that maybe my dad was holding my mom down by the throat or by force and she was scared and screaming about it. I was too young to realize all the possibilities and to put what happened together. When I got older, I remembered that my dad used to say that he would keep his bullets and a handgun in two different parts of the bedroom so that he wouldn't accidentally shoot one of us if he thought a robber was in the house. By having the bullets and gun separate, he would have to get up and think about what was going on instead of grabbing for a loaded gun quickly under his bed and giving himself a chance of shooting a family member who he might have mistaken for an intruder. 

Now that I'm older, I know that those five seconds of dead silence was my dad losing his mind in total, quiet, inner rage and using those seconds to decide what he would do in the next five seconds. Those next five seconds where I heard him stomping around his bedroom was him going to the place where he kept his gun, retrieving it, and then pointing it at my mom who thought that she was about to be murdered by her husband over a pair of socks. At the time, she didn't know that the gun didn't have bullets in it. My dad knew but he was so furious that he didn't care that she didn't know and threatened to kill her anyway. 

I never was in their bedroom when this happened. This is just what I've worked out over the years. Nobody in my family ever mentions what happened. I think my brother is too dumb to understand what happened and not at all introspective or thoughtful about our family. My little sister will never know because she was sleeping. She'll never know this is one of many reasons why I hate my parents and haven't talked to them since I was 20 years old. I've ignored them and only talked to them when necessary for years. The only reason they're not divorced is because my mom is a nobody with nowhere to go and no one who wants her and because to my dad - despite what you just read - my mom is the calming presence in his life and has been ever since his mother died when he was a little kid and since he managed to get away from his psychopath step mother who was abusive and filled him with all of his pent-up rage and anger. My dad needs my mom to be his dead mother. My mom needs my dad to take care of her whole life since she was a suicidal nobody when she met my dad after her own mother died when she was a teenager. 

Almost 15 years later I came to realize that my mother has borderline personality disorder and that her and my father are in a codependent relationship. I don't really consider their marriage a real marriage or normal although they appear normal to people outside of our family. My siblings don't know what I know about them or our family or what's gone on over the years. I'm alone with this knowledge and it's very hard and horrible. "

"That's not even the worst part of gentrification - the worst part is the trust fund babies that come into the neighborhood thinking they're either a) living the hard life since they have to live next door to poor brown folks or b) going to solve poverty and world conflict by shopping at overpriced, organic grocery stores and 'following' a random eastern religion. 

I read this article about a restaurant in a gentrifying part of NYC that had fake bullet holes in the walls and served wine in brown paper bags. I also heard about these tours they do in Compton, as if poverty were some type of museum. 

They complain about the lack of fun stuff to do, but not the lack of homeless shelters. They complain about the crime rates, but don't bother with things like volunteering at community centers or after school programs. These kids love the 'struggle' culture - they love the glamorized tales of violence they see in TV, they love paying $200 for jeans that look like they came from goodwill, they love having big lips and big butts and acting like stereotypes. Everything is cool when it's on TV and social media. But they're silent when people in the city struggle. They're silent when the group they idolize cries for help. 

I'm from the D.C. area - it's been gentrifying for the past 10 years or more. A little while back, the city installed a trolley system for the new hipsters that wanted a hip, cool way to travel. But fuck the constantly breaking down metro. But fuck the bus system. But fuck the school system, which - despite having the highest amount of money spent per pupil - is failing. Fuck getting affordable grocery stores into poorer areas. Up until now, DC was majority black. Now? These upper class hipsters are literally calling the cops on random brown (anyone who is black, Hispanic, or even middle eastern looking) people - some of which actually live in the neighborhood - because ""they look suspicious."" 

I'm all for poor neighborhoods coming into some money in order to fix what's broken. But FUCK the people who come into these impoverished neighborhoods thinking they run shit. "

The neighbor was a nosy gossip and ran out to see what was going on. The deacon said he was just taking my cousin to the skating rink. My cousin asked, ""That's where we're getting married?"" By that time, my aunt saw them all talking and went outside. She almost let my cousin go with him but didn't want nosy neighbor thinking my cousin was getting special treatment!! Turns out that deacon had a string of preteen ""wives"" and all the kids knew about it. My big construction man uncle and his brothers had a talk with the deacon.

"True, somewhere on reddit a woman went through a similar thing.

The pregnant woman wanted to buy a Mamaroo, but the thing is expensive so she found one for sale of Craigslist. The seller said she is expecting a kid too and she got 2 Mamaroos at her baby shower. They arranged a meeting, the pregnant woman got stuck at work, asked her mother to go instead, but didn't inform the seller. When the woman's mom got to the seller, the seller told the mom to get the Mamaroo from the back room (which was apparently disgustingly dirty with towels on the floor) because it was stacked on a high shelf and she can't get it herself because she's pregnant. So the mom said something like ""oh yeah no problem I wouldn't let my pregnant daughter do that either."" The seller then realised that this wasn't the woman she spoke to and she isn't pregnant and then told her to leave she's not selling the Mamaroo anymore. 

The mom ended up buying a Mamaroo at full price at a store, because the experience and the seller freaked her out so much, that she didn't want her pregnant daughter to go looking for another one on Craigslist.

"I hate him for what he isn't. 

The Euron I was hyped for was a menacing son of a bitch who cuts the tongues off of every person who serves on his ship, sailed to the smoldering ruins of old Valyria and came back with a horn that can bend dragons to his will (among other things). He raped his older brothers wife just to immaculate him, raped his younger brother just because he could and killed a younger brother still. He's a card carrying villain that somehow works among the surreal religions of the Iron Islands and reflects just how far the series has progressed from accessible fantasy to one of the heavier fantasy series out there.

Then show Euron shows up. Becomes king by way of penis and acts like a sadistic Jack Sparrow. Whoop-de fucking do. "
"I have an older co-worker that talks about having a house, wife, payed off new cars and no student debt often in regards to how we don't have things together. He only recently did the math and realized the costs of living, a traditional wedding, student costs, etc aren't at all the same now."

I wash my hands instead. That orange shit ain't right. When it's on a crunchy treat I guess I can ignore how gross it is. But when I finish and look at my ridiculous orange fingers I have a sad moment of clarity akin to the one I experience when cleaning semen out of my belly button.

"Was out on a date with this guy who told me how he buttered up one of the office workers while he was in high school so he could get away with everything.  Then he went on to say how he was Catholic so all he had to do was go to confession and it didn't matter what he did, God would forgive him.  
  
I ended the date swiftly after that and sealed him off on all forms of contact.  That kind of mentality is super dangerous."

"Judging a country's age by it's continuous government is a ridiculous benchmark. I get what you're saying about the US having a continuous government since it's inception (although...what about the US Civil War?) but it doesn't make any sense to judge a country's _age_ by this. Government has no relation to a _country_ when it comes to identity - that is formed of a historical, ethnic, cultural and linguistic link (as well as whatever other things define a nation).

It is basic fact that Poland was founded (as a Christian nation) in 966. That's far older than the US - in terms of putting modern nations onto their historical counterparts, this is one of the easier ones. Other examples are San Marino, France, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, England, Portugal, etc. 

This is also why successor states are a thing. Sure, the USSR wasn't _technically_ the nation of Russia (post 1922), but it every way it _was_ - that's why the modern Russian Federation is their official successor state.

"This is one that goes across the board though. Race? Say what you will about whites, but don't you dare bring up chicken and watermelon or 30 people in a van. Say what you want about straight people, but don't you dare mention lisps or butches. Say all you can about men, but don't you dare make that blonde joke.

Here's the thing, it's not that I'm insensitive to the people or subjects at hand. We have laws in place in America simply to protect the few from the many. But if we can't poke fun at each other, or with each other, or be able to acknowledge the flaws across the board, we don't have freedom and we can't grow as a society. In fact, we regress."

"This happened the other day at walmart, only at about 6 in the evening and the lines were jam-packed. There was a lady and her two small kiddos, and her card got declined, so she was asking the cashier to take stuff off, and try again. People were getting frustrated (I was 3rd in line, 2nd and 4th places were sighing loudly). 

Then this older man came up and just swiped his card and walked off. No idea where he came from. I think he may have whispered something to her, but I couldn't hear. She just started bawling and saying thank you over and over. And then I was teary-eyed, as was 2nd, and 4th, and the cashier. Big ol tear fest. "

"You have no clue what you are talking about. Let's try to fix that. All Israeli citizens are allowed in all Israeli cities and are afforded equal rights. This includes the 1.8 million Arab (Muslim) Israelis who live peacefully and with the best rights in the region. Yes the non citizens are treated differently than citizens, just like every other country like in the US. Israel Muslims and Christians can drive on Israeli roads just like Jewish Israelis, but no, non citizens cannot drive on Israeli roads. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, get over it, but no the IDF is not in charge of al aqsa, the Jordanian waqf is. The al aqsa mosque happens to have been built on the site of the destroyed Jewish temple... THE Holiest site in Judaism. Jews aren't allowed to pray at their holiest site, only at the outer wall of it, not to stand inside of the temple and pray like they should... but let's ignore that complete oppression of Jewish rights. 

What happened when Jordan occupied Jerusalem? The Jews weren't allowed, nor were christians... when the Jews are in control all are allowed. 

Let's move to why you think Palestinians (self declared foreigners who wouldn't accept any deal going from '48 to '67 to '73 to '81 to '99 to '00 to '08 all the way up to today) should be allowed to take advantages given to tax paying Israeli citizens?. These deals included full establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and gaza. Oh yea and gaza was fully autonomous from 2005 until they elected Hamas and started launching missiles in 2007... they chose war not peace, and have since blamed Israel and continued war.

**You take all the little things about them, and realize that's what makes them beautiful.** The sound of asshole taxi drivers, the smell of dirty water dogs, the taste of a baconeggandcheese sandwich, I wouldn't live without them. 

**Their imperfections make them who they are.** Sure, the fucking subway breaks down every day, and hour+ delays are common enough that I don't bat an eye, but it wouldn't be New York without being just punctual enough to not be late.

**Even if their home is nasty.** I'm gonna face it, New York looks like a dump. Flying rats and actual rats are everywhere. But I could never go a week without seeing a surprised tourist's face when they see a rat dragging a slice of pizza around the tracks.

**They step on your dreams.** Making it here is difficult. Staying here is difficult. Doing anything here is difficult.

**You come crawling back.** For me, New York is home. No matter what other cities I've lived in or been to, I always get butterflies when I return. I'm ready to return and face contempt and disappointment again. And through those rose-colored lenses, I wouldn't have it any other way."

We'd usually be able to convince at least one that he wouldn't be able to play and that the best thing to do would be to tell the head coach now so he could start adjusting his game plan. 

Coach was a good sport about it, but never played along. It was enough just seeing the look on the player's face when coach just shook his head in disbelief, and the guy realized he'd been had. "
