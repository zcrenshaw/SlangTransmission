"""Stans.""  Worshipping and obsessing over celebrities/internet personalities, making your entire identity based around them, etc.  It's honestly pretty disturbing to see how so much of their time and energy is devoted to a single person, who doesn't even know they exist, and likely never will.

Considering the term originated from the Eminem song, and they openly use it and embrace it, you figure they'd realize how fucking weird it is.  I'm sure some of them are just kids who don't know any better, but I know there are older teens and young adults who do this stuff as well.

EDIT: Apparently the term ""stan"" is just used interchangeably with ""fan"" in a lot of fanbases.  My post isn't about normal fans, or even longtime fans who have all of an artist's music, merch, etc.  This is about people who craft their identities and personalities around them, spend every waking moment devoted to them, know every detail about their personal lives, and in some cases, even stalk them in real life.

That's what the term was originally supposed to be about, but it's clearly lost some meaning by people not using it properly.  If you don't like the negative connotation that it brings, you probably shouldn't be using it to describe yourself unless you're actually a ""stan."""
