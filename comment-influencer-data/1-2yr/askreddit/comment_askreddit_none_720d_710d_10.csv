"What city? Not trying to discredit you, but student loans are around a couple hundred a month (I think, ours were), and in most areas in the US, a nice apartment is around $1000 - $1500/month. It should be noted that I'm leaving out downtown major metropolitan areas like downtown NYC, Chicago, San Francisco, and other well know ""out the ass"" expensive places. 

Gee it would be nice if someone were to add some constructive information here instead of offering blind downvotes. I don't even know why the hell I'm being downvoted."

"This is my point.  You don't know me.  I could be dangerous.  Why risk approaching me like this?  Over a cup thrown out of a car window or a cigarette butt at the curb?

Do you get to go back to the litter patrol club and announce you have converted someone? 

You're safer and better off minding your own business. "

Obama was a liar too and so was Hillary it's not anything new. 
Nice virtue signaling
"Most women let you fuck them without a condom if you insist. I've slept with girls of all races, ages, classes, everything, and the one thing in common was as much knowledge and talk about safe sex as they always had, once we actually got down to it, it was raw dogging and cumming inside her (most of the time anyways). Out of around 65 women, I recall exactly 3 in which I only had condom sex (and additional 10 or so I had condom sex with them, but eventually moved onto no condom). No complaints obviously I fucking loved it "
Without looking at your post history I can say with nearly absolute confidence that you post to T_D. 
"That's because you're naive and ignorant, i just turned 20 and didn't go to college because i knew exactly the type of shit it was. It's nothing but a worthless debt trap unless you're going into highly specialized fields. You're better off doing trades school, or trying to learn stuf(programing, web design, animation, ect)f on your own while working a labor job fulltime."
Please stop saying that. We really don't need more of shitting-everywhere-tourists.
"&gt;I have a hard time telling people they are living beyond their means when they are doing the same shit the generation before did...

They're not. The generation before had roommates out of school when living in expensive areas. They didn't spend money on computers, mobile phone subscriptions, cable, Internet, videogames etc."

"Sure they're perfectly safe for consumption (I mean there's an entire government agency who's purpose is to make sure all food sold is safe to eat), but at the end of the day I don't want the people who made Agent Orange messing around with my food, that's just a personal thing. Also Monsanto has been known to sue fathers who don't use GMO seeds when seeds from GMO farms just happen to blow onto theirs.  So fuck Monsanto,  I do my best to avoid giving them my business, regardless of whether their products are technically safe."
"You should be aware that because of this some may assume you are Christian. In many evangelical x-tian communities people don't capitalize their names as only God and Jesus are deserving of the upper case. Perhaps this wouldn't be so in the UK, but in the USA instead of assuming you're an asshole, they may assume you're one of those ""good people."" Personally, I'd rather people assume the former. Just FYI!"
"Get your facts straight. Communism died in the 80's and the only thing left are various forms of Socailism which work very well. England and Sweden are Socialist Monarchies. China is ever increasingly a hybrid socialist/capitalist dictatorship. Vietnam is a very successful Socialist state. Canada, France and Germany have a lot of Socialism in their governments. It's not black and white anymore."

You seem to be ignorant and naive.

That's called being programmed to reject anything that isn't part of the luciferian agenda. Part of that agenda is to worship technology which is why you are wasting time here all day glued to your phone.

"My whole issue with GMO's is the fact that if I have a farm and some of your GMO seed gets onto my land, it can not only take over all my plants, but I could then be sued or told I have to pay for the use of the GMO seeds....even though I did not want them on my land."

"I’m really not that interested to do any intensive research, I have read a few articles and papers which have been forced down my throat by a particularly militant vegan friend of mine. I accept that we need to do things a lot more efficiently, we waste so much food for no more reason than the general public doesn’t like to buy ‘ugly’ or misshapen veg. The future is bugs! We should be eating a lot more insects, they are a great source of protein, are plentiful and require far fewer resources to farm. "
None. I hate Johnny Depp
"I wish more people understood this. Everyone lives in their little fucking bubble and their eyes have not been opened to the real world because they refuse to travel or can't afford it. A good trip full of experiences is worth more than anything else when it comes to enjoying your life to the fullest and having an open mind.

Instead, we have a bunch these bigoted assholes that stay in their little bubbles hating on other countries they've never visited because of some faux news released by Fox and Friends. I am not talking about people who can't afford it, I am talking about people who choose not travel because of Faux News fear mongering."

"Libertarians believe taxation is theft, because it *is* theft.  If I stop paying my taxes, the government will take it by force one way or another.  I'm not saying it's not a necessary evil or anything, but let's call it what it is."

"Oh, how convenient, it wasn't really a mugging at all but a politically-motivated beating. Have any more made up shit you'd like to add? Was the attacker maybe a gay black Muslim carrying an ISIS flag?  "
Seems like a problem on your end then. Admittedly it could be written in a more consise way but it's far from being unintelligible. 
She rigged the DNC to win. She bribed the media to favor her. She was given inside knowledge of the debates ahead of time. She literally broken federal laws. She's fucking scum. Literally I'd say 16 million of those people only voted because she was a woman. Literally that was the only reason most people voted for her. Got to love that sexist shit right there. 
Creation and evolution are the same thing. 
I don't feel like dealing with some random person on reddit at midnight. You can go find the pro-life argument online if you wish.
"The issue is that since you have to give half of all your earnings and assets to your wife after marriage, they're basically holding you hostage and can do anything they want without any threat of you leaving, Then when they want to ""discover themselves again"" they just leave. 

In Asia I've heard that the issue is even worse in the cities where women take all the money men have and give them an allowance of $10-15 a day to spend while they do nothing. 

Maybe Merkel is bringing in all those refugees to destroy feminism and save men before it's too late /s"

"Most marriages are done out of convenience and not because they are actually all that into each other. Because of this, you'll get mostly responses about how they don't have sex often. Because people value convenience and tradition over actual love. It's really, really sad.

Edit: Getting downvoted by men who are in unhappy marriages; men who wish they could have done better. How sad."
"That we live on a cooling planet. That the holes in the Ozone layer are purely natural. That there is no ""man in the sky"". That the Kim's aren't the greatest people in the world, haven't hit 13 aces on a golf course, and haven't sent a man to the sun for solar samples. 

Why is science and logic constantly ignored because their belief has been drilled into their head? I don't know. "

"Oof, careful. I used to think it was the most hysterical movie ever and recently rewatched it and was so saddened to ruin my memory of it. Really weirdly homo/transphobic and just not anywhere near as many laugh out loud moments. "
"Blacks in the US are given priority for admissions to colleges, medical, law, and business schools, given priority for jobs and advancement in government and large corporations, and receive more in public assistance and education funding than they contribute to either. Tax incentives and building permits are issued on condition of the use of black owned businesses. And so on and so on and so on.  

Anywhere in society where an official distinction is made on the basis of race, and there are certainly tons of places where it is, it's to the advantage of blacks.  

Blacks in America have a higher standard of living than in any black majority nation on Earth. Data do not support the popular myths regarding police shootings of blacks.  

Nonsense and more nonsense, and this is really what we should be talking about. They think that blacks in this country are oppressed? Yes, can we *please* talk about this. I'd *love* to see us talk about this.   "

"Yuck on Kauai, at least on cultural terms.

That place was nothing but mainlanders, with very little Hawaiian anything.  The shops, the restaurants, the adventure things, all were run and staffed by mainlanders.

The Big Island was where I felt ""Polynesia"" instead of ""Hawaii-5-0"".  The Pu'uhonua o Honaunau; the Painted Church.  Volcano National Park.

edit:  I see I triggered a few people with my shared opinion.  lame

Granted, Kauai had the Waimea Canyon and Napa'ali coast which are very beautiful, but it still felt ""wrong""."
"From what I know, no one says that

If anything the court asks it for statistic purposes, but not as a deciding factor

Plus, it does make somewhat sense that whilst no one ever deserves to be raped, if someone is going out to rape someone, and they saw someone who dressed very provocatively, walking alone or something like that, it would make sense to think the rapist would target them out of anyone else.

Because in the end, their out to rape someone, and if they see that, that's gonna ""drive"" them the most.

I am not justifying rapists in anyway though. They are complete scum, but this is probably why that question is asked.

EDIT: please read to the end of the comment thread so there is no misunderstanding of what I meant."
I will at some point. I cant take it to a mechanic because of work and i dont own the tools nor do i trust myself enough to do it by myself. Theres a lot more wrong with ny car than just blinkers.
