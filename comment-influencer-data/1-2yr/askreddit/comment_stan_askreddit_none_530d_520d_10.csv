"Stan Lee, it's getting to a point where that is starting to feel like a real thing though. The dude is responsible for creating so many characters that have given so many of us years of entertainment, they inspired some of us, they made some of us feel like they weren't alone, they taught us lessons that would stick with us for life, that would shape parts of who we are. 
He will be missed."
