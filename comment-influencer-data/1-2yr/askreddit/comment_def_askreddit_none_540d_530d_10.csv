"My gf peed herself during sex at full stream, she was so embarrassed and was crying and a mess.  I convinced her she had squirted.  She became proud then went and had a shower.  I quickly changed the sheets and it was def piss.

Were your pastors Def Leppard?"
OMG mine was ice cream. And I was also peeing blood and internally bleeding from wearing a seat belt. But the ice cream was def it. 
"Ive wrote about this before, its one of the weirdest things Ive experienced. When my (now ex) boyfriend had just gotten together, I went out and bought him some new shirts. We had just fallen in love and I saw a shirt that said “Love Life” on it in big red bold letters. The shirt was all white with only the words on the front. It was a lil inside joke between us I guess because we would use that phrase to describe our life and named our business “Love Life”. He really loved it and wore it a lot before it sat in the closet for a couple years. Well a couple years go by and lets just say “love life” was a horrible definition of our relationship. He was horrible. Anyways Im cleaning out the closets, getting rid of old clothes and theres the shirt. I pull it out and the shirt now reads “Low Life” the exact same way it looked before but it says low life. I immediately ask him if he remembers the shirt and what it said and he tells me “love life” well as soon as I show him the shirt he flips out the same way I did. Both of us KNOW that the shirt never said low life... why would I buy anyone a shirt that said that let alone my boyfriend? 

Its like I flipped dimensions into the reality where my ex bf was a complete abusive douche and it showed up in the shirt. 

Edit: for people curious I found something similar but def not the exact shirt. It looked kinda like [this](https://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kustomwork.de%2Fimages%2Fproduct_images%2Foriginal_images%2Flow-life-red-white-model-2.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kustomwork.de%2F&amp;docid=00dKy6uRw8zw0M&amp;tbnid=HICCVXXDQvio7M%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=1000&amp;h=1000&amp;hl=en-us&amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim) but the letters were bolder, more impact style font, and there was nothing below it or anything else on the shirt."
