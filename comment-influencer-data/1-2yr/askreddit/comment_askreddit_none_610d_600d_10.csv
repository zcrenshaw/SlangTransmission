No but shouting from the highest rooftop i've got big bombs and I'll nuke you isn't going to help either

Well would surgeries and such not be paid through private health insurance or out of wages, i am really not sure what cost there would be to the military

&gt;the whole medical issue

Whilst not perfect Obamacare was meant with the right idea, those who are poorest get help for free, OK it wasn't great and created some other problems but it was a start, it should have been worked on and improved rather than just tossing completely, now yet again thousands of poor people are going to die due to a lack of basic medical care."

"Is that factual? His chart doesn’t say it accounts for all their sex just when she rejects him. It also doesn’t state what he did to try and get sex. Did he flirt? Did he make a move? Did he just say ‘sex, now’? Did he make an offhand remark hoping she’d pick up that he wanted sex?

"Oh? Last time i checked, USA got something called ""civil asset forfeiture"", which means that police can seize any amount of money you have on you without any proof or evidence of crime and it's your job to prove that the money is actually earned correctly.

There is also something called ""war on cash"" going on in many places, where higher-denomination notes are vilified and shops tend to refuse to accept them. It's one small step from that to government making a law that a $100 bill no longer legal for civilians to own."
That’s why most people grow up living off welfare. I was taught that you have to work hard and I’m accountable for my actions/ everying in my life. I had to wake up at 4am everyday to do the dishes and make my family breakfast

"It's OK but far from ""the safest"". I don't get why Reddit can't just be honest about the costs and benefits of nukes. "
"Absolutely, and that's why almost everyone including waitresses can take the day off.

If I always had to put the interests of strangers above mine, it would probably be me crying, but not in a restaurant with a handful of tax-free cash… Some people are simply careless arses who blame others for their incompetence and by extension misfortune, and it's really not my responsibility to support and try to rehabilitate them. I remain polite and patient but I'm surely not going to *reward* them.

In other words, you can't help everyone and you also can't tell if a stranger deserves that help, so why not buy something nice for your mum or daughter instead?"

"Uhhh if you think having sex only 3 times in almost 2 months is normal or indicative of a healthy relationship, you've got problems of your own. 

Normal and healthy relationships don't work that way. He's right to bring this up. The only other alternative would be to divorce her. 

You'll never have a healthy marriage with your mindset."

"Well reasoned points.

But all I can think of is that this is the world that men made. All of your points exist because men have allowed them to become a thing. 

Men wrote alimony laws because they didn’t want their wives to work and be independent. 
Men judge other men for hitting women because it’s not chivalrous. 

It’s literally all our own damn fault. 

Maybe if we lifted women up, and gave them some control for once, a lot of this stuff might be mitigated in a few decades. "

"Not provably so I'm afraid. 

I've looked for statistics on whether cycle helmets improve safety, and perhaps counter intuitively - no one's managed to prove it. "
"The same is true of using a flight of stairs or crossing the road. We don't wear helmets to go upstairs. 

It is _provably_ the case that making drivers wear helmets would save lives, more so than cyclists. "
"Sorry man, my first statement still applies. If only one person is initiating positions and movement and the like while the other is just passively following, you’re having bad sex. Might be a confidence thing or just a weird dynamics thing, not saying it’s a bad relationship, but sex is possible (and IMO fantastic) where both people are actively engaged and able to suggest positions, rhythm, or anything. 
To say that sex inherently has only one person in control is a little sad. 
Edit: meh, I deserve the downvotes as this was poorly worded. What I meant to say is if only one person *is ever* initiating etc. 
obviously there’s plenty of good sex to be had with one person in “control” but the commentator was referring to sex being *only* one person in control *ever*. That’s bad sex IMO. "
"Yes, it has increased enormously. It is still not on the same scale, in many industries, as men's income. We're making great progress, its not nearly as dire as it was 30 years ago by any means, but its still not equal - that's all. Its something we should be cognizant of. "

Meat is an easy way to get a lot of nutrients that are otherwise hard to get though. If you were to replace fish/chicken/beef with non-meat alternatives it just makes it a lot more complicated for the average person. I think it's much easier to just tell someone to eat some meat and then not have to think about eating beans and strange seeds to compensate. Not that it can't be done of course.
What an insecure person.

"There are shitty professors, too, though. I once had one who assigned an essay where we had to analyze a movie that addresses a social problem. I was a straight A student, I have never gotten less than an A on any essay I've ever written aside from this one. I've never had anything but praise from any other professor concerning the skills this assignment was meant to test. I had recently binge watched a season of American Horror Story, and I decided to write my paper about it, because I had an idea that I felt would be interesting and relevant to the assignment. Everything about my paper fit the assignment parameters, except that it was a TV show instead of a movie. She wouldn't even read it and gave me zero credit. Wouldn't even let me redo it for partial credit. I aced every other test, assignment, and paper in the class, but she wouldn't even consider reading this one fucking essay. I wound up with a B in the class.  There went my 4.0 GPA. 

I mean, I'd get it if I tried to do the assignment on a completely different medium, like a book or a song, but that was just fucking insane. "
"Its just a 60 dollar movie ticket. I don't have anything against linear games, but the story itself outshines the gameplay by a mile. The gameplay was repetitive, and the outcomes didn't matter. I would rather pay $10 to go to a theater to watch The Last of Us than to $60 to ""play"" it."

" This is not every person's experience though.  My husband and I get up every day because we're adults who have to pay for a house and need to work, kids have nothing to do with it. You also have to make &amp; eat dinner, even if you don't have kids.  Or order pizza if you're tired, kids love pizza.  I have a daycare, it costs a parent $300 every 2 weeks for 1 kid (10 hours a day, 5 days a week), and they can claim that on their taxes.  And we sleep in until 9 every weekend.  We told our kids nobody gets up before the sun does, enforced that, so they became sleepers too.  

Sure the first year is tough, and there are hard parts here and there.  But you have a lot of say into how you want your life to be, kids or not."

"Lots of these are a result from discrimination against women. For the longest time women weren't allowed in combat roles. America and even countries like China have affirmative action for men for university, men are less likely to pick the option because they have options like the military, trades and sports. Some of these are utter bullshit. 
The high majority of custody cases are decided between the parents themselves.

* In 51 percent of custody cases, both parents agreed — on their own — that mom become the custodial parent.
* In 29 percent of custody cases, the decision was made without any third party involvement.
* In 11 percent of custody cases, the decision for mom to have custody was made during mediation.
* In 5 percent of custody cases, the issue was resolved after a custody evaluation.
Only 4 percent of custody cases went to trial and of that 4 percent, only 1.5 percent completed custody litigation.

Breast cancer is also far more deadly than both testicular and prostate cancer combined. You also get it at a much younger age, while prostate cancer is 65+ and most men don't even bother to fight it because of how unlikely it is too kill them. "

"Op here. I asked this question because I didn't realize I grew up privileged financially until high school. I assumed my family was average. I now know that my parents are bordering on the edge of upper class. We have a large house. 6 bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms. I got every single nintendo console as they came out for christmas.

 In college, I learned about the other privileges I had such as being white and straight in america. My parents (and all of my relatives) are still married.   My parents never physically or emotionally abused me. I am now fiercely defending the rights of my friends.
