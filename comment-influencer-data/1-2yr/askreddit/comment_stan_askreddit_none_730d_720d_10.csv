"freshly turned 15 teenage girl from western canada here. forgive me for the messy list because i'm trying to write whatever comes to mind!

""skater"" clothing without actually knowing how to skate is pretty in fashion at my school e.g. thrasher, supreme, vans, the whole shebang

in terms of music hip hop/rap is what everyone listens to. particularly tyler, the creator, frank ocean, childish gambino, and xxxtentacion is on the rise too. lo-fi hip hop e.g. tomppabeats and similar ""soundcloud"" artists are pretty cool. and if you don't listen to that then, what do you even listen to? (kidding. obviously other music exists but this thread is about whats ""cool"" right now.)

particularly in my school a lot of kids are into having their own youtube channels, some kids are ""vlogging"", others are making their own very creative short films and skits, others making gaming videos. the same creative kids are also making rap tracks on soundcloud with pirated fl studio. just a lot of content creation going on and honestly it's probably the coolest thing on this list. it's popularity with a sense of individuality because obviously everybody's making different shit. 

for shoes, a lot of white. nike air force 1s are still in style. also, a lot of girls are wearing adidas superstars or stan smiths. the guys, yeezys. adidas jackets with the classic 3 striped sleeves are also popular. in general lots of athleisure clothing

dyed hair รก la scene/emo kids is not that big anymore. girls like dying their hair still, but natural colours like blonde or light brunette are much more ""in"" than, say, vibrant reds and pinks. also, straight-across bangs with a little bit of forehead showing through is a hairstyle a lot of girls are sporting here. only a couple of guys with dyed hair in my school  and pretty much all of them blond or platinum.

it's not really ""cool"" to have bad grades anymore (if it ever was, or TV is just lying to me.) being smart (but not obsessive) makes you look awesome. a few of the REALLY popular kids in my grade skipped a level in math and are now taking math class with the grade above us. (i don't really know how it works elsewhere, but here, our math classes are by grade and not separate classes on topic like ""algebra"" or ""geometry"", we just have ""math 9"" ""math 10"" ""precalc 11"" etc.)

90s is a big thing too. less ridiculous renditions of 90s fashion are in. 90s r&amp;b is veryyyy popular especially with girls. 

something that ISNT cool is really bright, bold colours like highlighter yellow or pink. colours in fashion have become really muted. i see lots of burgundy, black, grey, navy, but the style/cut of the clothing makes it less ""drab"" if u know what i mean. 

asian languages like japanese and chinese are pretty popular on t-shirt designs. anime is cool if you aren't a fucking cringey ass weeaboo. also, kpop is very much a big thing with girls of all races here. boybands i hear about a lot are bts and seventeen. 

dabbing isnt really poplar anymore. its only done ironically. more common ""dance moves"" i see are ""milly rocking"" and ""hitting the folks"" i guess. 

slang i hear a lot:
""aesthetic""
""lit/litty"" self explanatory
""bet"" pretty much used to end a conversation
""tea"" in place of ""gossip"", like, when talking about someone ""spill the tea!!!""
""finesse"" when stealing something or pretty much being a smartass to get out of a situation
""sick"" is coming back
""deadass"" kinda used in place of ""definitely""
""finna"" ""clout"" etc etc etc a lot of it is just mimicing AAVE ""african american vernacular english"" because for some reason being black or asian(again, kpop and anime) is in right now?


nothing else really comes to mind. hope this helps you to camouflage as a high schooler for some weird reason

edit: i know this is annoying but wow thanks for gold and reddit clout &lt;3"
