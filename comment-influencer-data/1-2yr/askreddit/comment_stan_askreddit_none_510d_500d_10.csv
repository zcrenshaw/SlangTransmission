"Reminds me of a scene in American Dad where Stan goes back in time to visit his wife when she was young. 

Young Francine: You look a lot like my fiancé, except much older and fatter.

Old Stan: Well, see, in the future, there’s this place called Jamba Juice and they make you think it’s really healthy when it really just makes you fat."
