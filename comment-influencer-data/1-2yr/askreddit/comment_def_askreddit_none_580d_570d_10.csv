"Fellow EMT told me this story two years ago so I might butcher it a bit, but I got chills hearing it at the time.

He was working the overnight shift in Quincy when dispatch gave him a call to do a wellbeing check on an address that called through a landline but no one was talking. Naturally they go to the house with police and fire to check on the possible pt. House is completely dark with no electricity even running through it and it’s abandoned. They check the surrounding houses making sure people are okay and then leave after figuring that nothing was wrong.

A couple hours later same call, same situation. So this time they go to explore the inside of the house more. Fire and police are in the first and second floor while my friend and his partner go to the basement. When they get down there and are searching around with flashlights, they get a chill and then my friend’s partner screams and says something grabbed him (nothing’s there). They fuckin dip upstairs and into front yard.

Everyone is out there in a few and it’s silent. Fire chief then asks if anyone else got a weird chill in there which they all agreed. Calls over. 

Few more hours they get another call to the same house, but no one goes in this time. 

EDIT : Holy shit woke up and this blew up. I just want to add that other overnight EMT’s working with my friend said that address apparently does it very frequently too. 

EDIT 2 : A lot of people seemed kinda confused about the details of the story. Again I am NOT the person in the story, just retelling it.

My friend, the EMT, WENT to the call the third and times after, but when Police already cleared a house you don’t need to just reenter it every time. They continued searching the area and nothing came up. Also not an EMTs job to search abandoned houses without police, scene safety!!

Sorry I don’t have more details either, would love to be able to accurately answer all questions. But the only one I can def answer is this is Quincy, MA!"
"def one of the smartest answers in this thread, but men would be able to sniff you out.  It would be hard to hide from the entire world."
"Oh man, I got to straight up tell a dude he was being cheap. Comes in rocking an Apple Watch, AirPods, the whole Apple suite. Tried to get his girl a $13 CalEx wired bullet, I was like, “you know, I think this is a season for treating your partner, and it seems like you’re kind of cheaping out on this. If you don’t think she’ll hold you accountable for that, you’re wrong”. $170 later he had bought a sensuelle Bentlii and all the trimmings. Def my best upsell this year"
