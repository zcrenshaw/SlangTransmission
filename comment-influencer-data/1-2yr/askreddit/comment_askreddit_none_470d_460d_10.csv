Rape. I know that some people are capable but honestly I just find it hard to stomach. I've never really been able to bring myself to do it

"Now why is that, because it seemed a pretty innocent statement to me, but I’m getting downvoted. How else do you explain systemic racism than including power dynamics?"
Yeah it’s almost like my tax dollars are paying for it so yours don’t have to. 
Idk what lu lu lemon is but it sounds ultra gay
That you're racist is only the second thing people notice about you. The first is that you're an inveterate liar.

"I'm a feminist. I think most men get really offended by 3rd wave feminism cause they feel their previledge- that most dont even aknowledge- attacked. That's why so many say theyre pro sex equaity, but dont call themselves feminists. They're pro sex equality on a very surface, passive, everything-actually-stays-the-same, we dont wanna admit we're priveledge and inactive about it way.
Feminism offends close minds, and men. 
Now, there are some pretty crazy posts online, that I honestly doubt where even actually written by a feminist and not some softboi trying to ""prove"" how feminism had«s gone crazy."
um how will the children get education dumbass

"Why would they? When was the last time you saw that happen? As a dude, my personal experiences say that if a girl says a dude did X, then he did X no questions asked and it’s on the dude to prove beyond a shadow of doubt that it is not the case. "

"I care about my ability to have privacy if and when I feel it's needed. Right now I don't feel it's needed. I am aware that I may in the future, and that's why I want to preserve the OPTION of privacy in any way possible.

What I'm getting at is currently, in our society, I have nothing to hide... but, for example, let's say a Christian theocracy came into power undermining our democratic government and started punishing non-believers... at that point I would want all the privacy I could get. So while I don't care about it or need it now, I do want to protect it just in case.

edit: **You fucking morons, I said I DO care about privacy... read my second paragraph.**"

"Not necessarily. My sisters friend who used to be slim started gaining weight rapidly because of a new drug against epilepsy, and she couldn’t loose it before she changed her medicine again.

W'ere not helpless against it - boosting NAD+ levels in the blood by taking Nicotinamide Riboside helps a little and every dollar donated to SENS Research Foundation goes towards fighting aging.
"What part is toxic and abusive? Cause I read the books and from the start he told her that he was into bdsm and they shouldn't date because of it, and she still wanted to date him. Then once they were dating he was like anytime you want to stop just say so, and she doesn't. I fail to see what is so bad? The worst thing he does is spank her after she asks him to. At any point she can literally just say no thanks and walk away.  "
"I'm sure they already know lol. Calm down, son, you just didn't get the joke, and that's ok. Not everybody gets every joke.

"LOTs of creative liberties, yes, but based on a kernal of truth. So... no truth whatsoever? No, I don't think that's accurate, 'nothing like the gruesome story in my comment', that's fair to say.

The Urban Legend is not *true as told*, it has a kernal of truth in it. 

So perhaps I'm being too liberal with 'turned out to be true'?"
Why doesn't it bother you to be some monarch's subject?  As an American that just seems backwards and humiliating.
"What the fuck does that have to do with sex? Do you use sex as currency for chores in your relationship? If so, that is awful and I feel very sorry for your partner."
He doesn't even sing. He just talks into the mic and autotunes it lol.

"Why dont we have like a worldwide institution for just hunting down fucks like that? Get a hint, sent out investigators, confirm, send out a kill team. Clean, efficient and fast, wont waste money for all the trial proceses and everything."
Good question 
"If the cases with strong evidence get dismissed, then the ones with more esoteric evidence would get dismissed as well. It doesn't make them any less true. Alefantis is a fucking creep though."
"There was this arcade game that I forget the name of. It was real popular and m-fers were dropping crazy quarters on it every time you went to the arcade. It was a fighting game, and it was really good. Anyways, there was the end boss named Balrog or some sh-t and he was bad as f-ck. And one night this one guy told me if I head down to this other town's arcade there was, like, some way to play AS THAT GUY and you couldn't be beat.  Naturally, I was, like, nah-uh. But it turned out to be true!

Also, Mortal Kombat machines had some crazy ass sh-t. Did you know you could kill people in that game?"
As opposed to a chicken bull?
"Meat, dairy, eggs and other animal products. Pretty weird that we eat the chopped up pieces of dead animals when we don’t need to, but only cause they taste good. 

Pretty happy that I no longer contribute to unnecessary suffering, plus it’s better for the environment and my own health!"
"this dude never ""touched kids"" he went around asking if he could feel their biceps

"Well usually when a man and a woman love each other and want to make it legally and socially binding, they decide to get married."
"Childbirth in a hospital with several qualified professionals and drugs? No real biggy.

Childbirth without any qualified people around while surrounded by a hysterical gaggle of women and a couple of nutty shamans in a mud hut? Yeah, I'd imagine that hurts. "

"Fuck you all the way. If you're not happy you end it, you fucking asshole. You're a pathetic excuse for a human being and I hope you die a horrible death, you motherfucker"
It would definitely be march 1st how is that even a question lmfao 
"Yeah but why would it definitly be after and not before?
I want to understand the logic of his statement"
The awful fucking spelling.
I met Pickton's brother when I was a kid. He was a super nice guy and never talked to his brother cuz he was a weirdo. Go figure. Once he was caught it really made is life tough. I can only imagine trying to live your life after everyone knows your brother was a serial killer. 
"I might as well have since nothing changes. Adding in a kettle drum here and there and another string instrument doesn't make it ""better"". The entire song is ""Draiman does a line real low, add another percussion/string instrument for a bar/have Draiman sing ever so slightly higher"". It crescendos and never pays off. I like a lot of music and I'm open to a lot of music. It's a shit cover. It's boring and tries exceptionally too hard ""to not be your dad's introspective music"".

Disturbed DOES good covers. Midlife Crisis and Land of Confusion are fantastic. Sound of Silence is hot trash, and that's not even comparing it to the original. Metal has a real issue with trying to cover things and they USUALLY come off over the top but Disturbed managed to be underwhelming and pretentious instead of ridiculous. "

I got nothing to hide. I doubt they want to watch me look at Reddit and listen to me talk to my mom on the phone. 
Pretty sure mine was a legit question.
I wish it would happen *soon*. The amount of damage that has been done lately is going to take a long time to recover from.

"Yeah, but on causation grounds- for a homicide you need to have caused someone’s death. It’s definitely arguable, but it’s a lot easier to say that the deceased was killed by electricity than by a man having stood on a train platform."

Well that might be because you're high right now
"Arctic monkeys. Tried to listen to one of their albums recently because it was the ""cool"" thing to do, realized after about 40 minutes that the album wasn't just one continuous song but a number of songs that just sounded like a single song."
"After losing net neutrality in America, hopefully this will stay.

How did it work?  NFL owners lost hundreds of millions of dollars and nearly 20% of their viewers. 
No player has been disciplined by kneeling yet.
No NFL players are being fired. So its not related.
All we're talking about is whether the douches should be fired or not for assing around on company property/time.  It only worked if that was their goal/issue.
"These articles are stupid. The quotes are all out of context and if you had read the books you would know. The reason why Ana says “No.” and tries to kick him off is because she just got back from a run and was embarrassed of smelly sweat and thought Christian would be turned off by her sweating.
The other quote ‘No, please. I can’t do this. Not now. I need some time. Please.” “Oh, Ana, don’t overthink this.” Ana says this because she feels turned off by the fact that she looks like Christian’s mom, but as soon as Christian kisses her again, she is turned back on and wants to have sex with him, because she was overthinking it.
“’Alaska is very cold and no place to run. I would find you. I can track your cell phone- remember?’” HE WAS JUST JOKING. He was not serious when he said this. 
People just like to overreact when they read quotes out of context. "

Of course, if you have proof I will gladly change my stance, and I have many things to talk about with you. 

Edit: so I take it by the downvote but lack of proof that I was right? "
George Lucas sold the rights to Disney and they rebooted the series 10 years after the last film in the franchise. The definition is to restart or revive a series and I think this would justify as a revival.
"Well, this post just got too much downvotes. What I meant was that the so called HandsUp Artists all sound the same. Much worse: They use music from artists who even don't make any Techno or Electro like Rammstein or Böhse Onkelz and turn it into ""HandsUp""... Just stop that, PLEASE!"
The point of what I said is that's it's doing all that with Half the Budget
"I think the issue is that some people don't think they are being racist when they are and have to figure that out.

It may have been a waste of time for a lot of people, but hopefully somebody learned something."
"I for one was pleasantly surprised. Granted I have about as low an opinion of Starbucks as a corporation as is possible, but I think Starbucks genuinely tried their best to address and prevent events like Philadelphia. Yes, the training was mostly about white on black racism and it didn’t really address any other ethnicities. Yes, Howard is probably going to use this in his presidential campaign. However, Starbucks took a step in the right direction and while imperfect I think they did a good job all things considered."

"If it didnt taste good no one would buy it. Its such an old person douchey thing to point out how terrible it is, yet each one has a line out to the street every morning. People love Starbucks, trying to act superior by pretending like theres some secret out there that only you understand theres better coffee is such a tired trope. "

But I suppose the worst is my friend Brian. The dude uses his ""Childhood"" as an excuse. He claims his step father for 2 years only let him sit in his room and stare at a ceiling and that this same guy killed his little sister and got away with it (No one believes this) yet for some reason or another has yet to off the bastard himself? No. Bullshit.
The man is an idiot meme lord who does nothing but recite memes. He claims he can't have connections to anyone emotionally yet he still hangs out with us and has 4 girlfriends at a time. We're gamers but him, he can't even enjoy a game for anything. His favorite words are ""Interesting"" and ""Samey"" claiming something has to be Interesting to keep his attention but he'll get bored of it within minutes (ADHD probably) and anything that makes him do something more than once is Samey to him and that's his argument ""Its too Samey to be interesting"" like What the hell is that supposed to mean? Why even be a gamer or play video games then? Theres no such thing as a game that isn't repetitive he's picked the wrong hobby.
He's just an ass claims he hates any and all aggression yet he himself gets super aggressive at anything he doesn't like. But if we get aggressive he loses his shit and claims to not speak with us. We don't bother calling him on his shit because we don't feel like fighting by mod god is the man just a pretentious asshole who thinks he knows everything then expects his son story to get him his way. He has a better life than I do and yet if any one of us dare try to complain about having a rough day he gives us that shit."
