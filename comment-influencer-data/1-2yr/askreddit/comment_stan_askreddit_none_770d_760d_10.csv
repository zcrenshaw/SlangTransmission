"I watched the show Dog With A Blog with younger cousins and two episodes stood out. In an earlier season, Stan, the talking dog, told the story of getting a little white pill and after a strange weekend at the vet, he had no desire for kids anymore. My cousins did not understand but basically, Stan got neutered. Then, in a later season, Stan gets 'married' and has puppies. I feel like the only one who noticed this."
