"Def found a coconut and kept it around before Jane 

Edit. My first gold and highest upcoconutted comment is about that damn coconut story reddit can’t seem to forget. Lmao why"
"Met up with a guy from collegeclub.com and we had planned for a quick bite to eat. I had forgotten my wallet so he came to my dorm room with me to quickly grab it. We get there and He immediately starts looking around at all my of photos etc. around the room. He finds my Homer Simpson slippers and a rooster beanie boo my nephew had left there. He takes the rooster and stuffs it in Homer’s mouth and makes it move (as if the slipper was chewing) and says “Look at me. I am vain. I create suffering for animals so I can feast. Selfish hungry bitch”. I was speechless but then he opens my drawer and starts throwing makeup around saying “this is tested on animals - I am vain. Animals suffer for my beauty” And THEN opened my wardrobe and started throwing clothes around saying “these things have been made in sweat shops” My friend called security on him. 

Edited to add: This was not our first date. More like 6th or 7th and every other time the guy was a peach! He was considerate, a great listener and made me laugh. All in all, a really (seemingly) genuine nice guy. He had never previously mentioned being vegan (we had went on coffee dates and he ordered black - nothing else) and this was to be our first time going to a restaurant together - thankfully we didn’t because it was for weekend brunch and I would have def got the bacon!!"
"We went on this really adorable date where we just wandered around a grocery store. It was fun, started conversations about foods we liked and places we traveled--would def recommend. 


As we were walking he picked up a Vitamin Water and started drinking it. Not a problem, I do it sometimes when I'm thirsty. But when we were almost done with the whole store, he hid the half-drank bottle behind a bag of Little Debbie donuts. 


I asked if he was gonna pay for it and he said ""Fuck them they get enough profit"" and went to leave. I picked it up and paid for it. 


The rest of the evening was really awkward and it made me think of him as an asshole and kinda a thief. Never felt the same after that. "
I took so much time getting Str ups and Def ups in addition to the ultima sword that the fight wasn't even a fight anymore.
"It’s such bullshit because, as an obese woman, it’s so fucking obvious that my size makes it more difficult to do things normal sized people can do. Fuck, I lost some weight and I can tell it’s easier to do almost everything because I have less mass to drag around.

Learn to love yourself all you want, you’re stuck with yourself your whole life, but it’s absolutely ridiculous to deny being fat (or too skinny, def some HAES people on the opposite end) is bad for you."
