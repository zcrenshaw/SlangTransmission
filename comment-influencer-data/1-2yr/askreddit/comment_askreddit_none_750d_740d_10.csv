"A new car.

1. Im broke. I bought a 700$ accord two years ago and it lasted through July, when the power steering failed. Needed a complete rack replacement, just not worth it. Traded that car for a nice smart tv and a PS4, and bought another 700 accord. So for the cost of four car payments, Ive gotten 3 years of car so far.(assuming this one makes it to next july, which in my experience, it will easily)

2. They depreciate more than Ive spent on a car in years just driving it off the lot.

3. No need for one, even though it would be  nice. But a new car you have to repair and spend a ton of money on keeping it good. This one, parts are easy to come by, it isnt full of technical wiring and electronic BS, and there is a video on youtube to fix anything. So far, my craftsman socket set has fixed every major thing Ive needed fixed.

4. I dont need to worry about scratches or bumps. "
Wouldn't surprise me in the slightest lol I'm saving for my own car now

"I worked with a program called [Re-Member](http://www.re-member.org/), and while I found it through a church, it is not a missionary/spreading Christianity thing. It just so happened to be how I found it. If I remember correctly, the founders of the organization made it so that it was an organization to help. No religion, no preaching, no 'we are here to save you', just helping people in a community who needed help. During the day you would learn about the culture, do work (insulating trailer, building outhouses, building stairs, building ramps, bunkbeds and delivering and installing them all), and at night after dinner, someone from the reservation would come talk to us about various aspects of the reservation or the culture. I HIGHLY recommend anyone looking to volunteer or donate to the cause to help out this organization. "

"Girlfriend is off the rez also, can agree I've never met a single person in her extended family. We've been dating for two years now and I still know not to go there. It's not like there's any great trauma, she just says she'd rather not even think about them and their idiotic choices. Really sad, as I come from a very well put together and normal nuclear family, but hey, we're hoping to make one of our own, so she won't miss out completely :)"

"False. Coupling was amazing. He just struggles with mysteries, and needs to be reigned in.

There's an [amazing video by Hbomberguy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkoGBOs5ecM) focused primarily on Sherlock but also touches on Dr Who and his general writing style, that fully explains Moffat's issues (though it is nearly two hours long). 

The crux of it though is that Stephen Moffat A) isn't interested in creating solvable mysteries, and B) in both Sherlock and Dr Who, the day is saved through reputation, both Sherlock and the Doctor are the smartest person in the room and ergo the most important, and their reputation lets them do anything. 

I can't remember who said it on Reddit, but Moffat's mysteries aren't ""If your compass always points south and you see a bear, what colour is it?"" (white because you're on the north pole), but instead Moffat's mysteries are more multiple people saying ""The bear is white"" without context and then the last episode of a series happens to take place in the North pole, and thus those random statements are suddenly relevant (even though there's no reason for it to be the north pole, and no polar bears).

Diplomacy isn't that deep in the game, but you still have to do missions with different lords to make them like you, and mods like ""diplomacy"" make it better with minimal changes to the game, with things like adding central managembent of businesses, messages you can send to lords, generally making it easier to manage relations across the map.

"I grew up for a portion of my life in the Navajo reservation. I learned that throughout my time there with my grandparents(who i cant communicate with because they don't know English and nor do I Navajo) that there's a lot of grit in myself, my family, and my people. I learned what great value water has on our planet and not to waste it. I learned how to respect people in a way that feels good to my soul and is naturally followable. I learn many things from my grandparents despite never having a conversation with either of them. They truly are great people. Humbled to the bone. You don't see people like that in the city. They're real diamonds in the rough and i appreciate every moment with them. I learned the great value that family is when your close and don't hold grudges against each other. I learned what real love was because I never found it being bullied in school. You learn how to make do out there with what you got. I learned how to ride horses, heard sheep, and be a cowboy with boots on everyday. Hard to believe I could be two different people in one. A city boy and a rez kid. I got in my first group fight on the reservation. My brothers and I kicked their asses with minor losses of our own. We learned to be brothers even if we were friends or cousins, we were all brothers. I learned how to drive out there at 8 years old. I learned that I could do anything I ever wanted before any teacher ever tried to let me know. I learned how to feel special and believe in myself out there. Nothing in the world is like the rez. Its a desert but its beautiful and full of life that you wouldn't notice driving by."

"My girlfriend and I will watch this and Vanderpump Rules to relax after work/school. For some reason there is just something so relaxing about watching the lives of horrible, self absorbed people. 

My favorite couple is the one with the guy from the Dominican Republic who I don't think ever showed even a hint of anything resembling compassion for his fiancé. Simultaneously his family despises her for no real reason and they just play it off as a ""cultural difference."""

"How has nobody said it yet? Maybe the hate train has slowed down for this show but I can't stand it and it's not allowed on in my household. 

UNCLE GRANDPA. Like, even the fucking name doesn't make sense. I sincerely think it's a show to make children dumber somehow or they want kids to imitate him in some way. I have never hated a show more than this one."
"My dad got out, but I hang out with family on the rez. 

It is run down. Dirty, dry, it is a place that feels like it wants to remove anything from the outside and protect its inhabitants by making it literally the last place on earth worth going to. 

QPeople and kids want to live together since family is all they know and care about. Why graduate and go away to college if you just want to be a firefighter in your area anyway? So on a minority are people who want education and our people to interact with the world. And the other group is a bunch of disillusioned people in the middle of nowhere.

This carries to the tribal council. Families hold grudges for generations. Thankfully my band is pretty isolated and isn't too tangled up with the other bands. We all know great grandpa was our leader and kinda respect that. It's different for other bands within the tribe (7 bands in all I think). You would think a tribe would have some sense of solidarity, but the only solidarity that ever shows up is when outsiders try to enter. Say a half white kid like myself who is trying to get connected to his roots.

Also, everyone has equal say at every meeting. Since the educated members are off rez, then the ones that do make it to the meetings and decide what to do (deciding to accept govt grants, allow for businesses to work with the tribe, or decide big casino based descisions). These decisions can include legal frameworks, pros and cons lists, powerpoint presentations, etc. They approach this with distrust etc since they didn't go to school and have no clue how to approach these decisions with an unemotional response.

This is all while there are serious problems going on the rez and around it. Stuff that the tribe should be concerned about but when people try to help they get the cold shoulder and when educated members come home to try and reach them, they get branded as trying to be bossy and upity when really they just want to help.

I am glad my dad did what he had to do to get out. I am trying to help the tribe now, but the only people I can really influence are my cousins in my own band/clan. So yeah, that is where I am now, on the band's council and hopefully my outside life can continue to allow me to be engaged in a career that will one day end with me as an elder on the tribal council. It is the right thing to do, fingers crossed"

"I think affirmative action is needed, at least in employment if not in education. There are still people in this country who would deny someone an opportunity they deserve simply based on race or skin color. I do agree with your other points. Unfortunately, there is too much money being made off of those poor souls who turn to a life of crime as their only means of survival. Maybe if people genuinely wanted to help those in desperate situations rather than profit off of them.... Then perhaps change could be made. But that's certainly not the case. "

"If by gateway drug you mean that people smoke weed before doing other drugs, which besides the chronology is arbitrary, then yes it is but by that measure so is coffee, cigarettes and any other drug.

"Al Gore is right and basically nobody cares, and every year going forward is likely to be the hottest year on record. Humans have engaged in Deforestation such that 20% of CO2 buildup in the atmosphere is estimated to be due to deforestation. And it's not a new thing: humans have been deforesting land since the neolithic. The British isles were heavily deforested as early as 5000BCE: the barren moors Yorkshire and Scotland were once forests.

Free will, as it turns out, is not as simple as we may have imagined it. We're not dealing with a free and easy system that will do whatever we will at any time. There is an element of autonomy, part of you that seeks homeostasis through pattern and repetition. And there is a part of you that is an animal that has desires that you did not decide upon with your free will, that part of your brain seems to have a will of it's own.   

But you need not be a slave to the output of your autonomous programming, or to the wild animal. Free will exists, as an interplay between your conscious mind, and the autonomous parts of your body.

Mastering free will is what allows us to upgrade our programming. Our programming is not limited to making delicious portions of flour, water, egg, parmesan, and bacon. We can do fantastic things like 'goto_moon.ts' or 'fix_a_brain.php'. These things are clearly not the result of a purely autonomous system that seeks only to maintain homeostasis.

Doctors don't have magical diagnosing powers. They match the patients symptoms with their own knowledge. Sometimes you get patients who don't exhibit symptoms that are typical of some diseases. Sometimes you get patients with illnesses even the doctor hasn't heard of. Doctors just aren't equipped to handle every single patient that might come through the door just because of how many possible diseases there are.

"I'm a woman, I was hit on by another woman for the first time in my early 20s and I reacted so awkwardly. I think it was one of her first times trying to pick up a woman as well, she seemed very flustered and mentioned that her sister (who was at another table) didn't know she was bi-curious.

At one point she asked me ""Can I have your number? Is that weird?"" and my thought process was ""Weird? Well no, it's not weird for a woman to hit on another woman and want her number. This is the 21st century."" So I kinda talked myself into giving her my number even though I'm completely straight, just because she phrased it that way and I didn't want to say ""Yes that's weird"", because really, it's not.

Then the next day she left me a really nervous-sounding voicemail asking if I wanted to go out and I felt terrible as I texted her that I actually had no interest in women. I hope she found someone else to satisfy her curiosity!"

"I think this comes down to you torturing yourself psychologically.  I know it's scary to not understand 100% of what happens around or inside you, it means you aren't guaranteed control or safety because you can't guard against every possibility.  It also makes it difficult to ascribe meaning to your actions, because there is no objective universal measure of success or failure, good or evil, or any other value system.

Basically you need to become OK with not knowing.  Keep your eyes open and your mind receptive to new evidence, but act on the information you have now.  Everyone acts this way, just some more consciously than others.  There is no real certainty, but you can say ""with what I currently believe to be true, this is the best choice"".  Yeah, you might make mistakes, but you made them in good faith while attempting to do right.  That's why we factor the foreseeable consequences of failure into our choices.

Realistically, why is not knowing the workings of your brain to an atomic level important to your day to day life?  What bearing does solipsism have on your being if it's unverifiable?  We act as if our actions have meaning because it's the logical choice.  If actions are predetermined then we really lose nothing by trying to live well, we were destined for whatever happens.  If the future is subject to our choices in the moment then then what we choose is important.  The only truly losing set of possibilities is if our choices do matter and yet we act as if they don't.  That's the only path where you can end up worse than you did for trying.  Taking chances is a part of life, and yes, there's a (minute) chance that going outside a plane could crash or lightening could hit you, but when you weigh your agoraphobia and existentialism against the lost opportunities of living life fully, you get more from taking those small risks by far."
"Just remember that you broke up with her for a reason, and when you go into the next relationship watch to make sure it won't happen again. Now that you know what can kill a relationship, you're much more prepared than you were when you were younger. 

It sounds cliche, but there are lots of women out there looking for a good man who's grown up a bit. They're not always easy to find, but when you're ready to start looking again you'll find them. Just don't rush! Enjoy your time doing whatever you want whenever you want. It can be really satisfying in its own way, and when you feel like you're truly ready to start dating again it will put you into the right headspace to be attractive to the type of woman you're looking for. "

A lot of people in the LGBT+ community (at least the ones I've met) don't actually believe in [all of these Tumblr genders](http://genderfluidsupport.tumblr.com/gender). It's important to remember that most of these genders are Tumblr ones (which aren't as 'official' as others) instead of ones widely accepted in the community. 

I believe bi actually means being attracted to more than one gender, so it could be men, women as well as others. It isn't as cookie-cutter as some people believe. And then there are pansexuals, who are attracted to people regardless of gender, which is a different thing all together :)

It's really confusing, and sorry if I made no sense or came across as very preachy."

"I didn't quite grow up on a reservation, but rather a village in rural Alaska. Alaska Natives an interesting history in their land claims settlement. 

I grew up in a small village called Chignik in Southwest Alaska for most of my childhood. I played outside a lot, made my own entertainment, saw plenty bears, and learned how to harvest and prepare food from the land. My family were fishermen and hunted animals so that we had meat for the winter. 

Alcoholism is quite prevalent in villages, so I also grew up around alcohol abuse. I've also heard stories of sexual abuse happening throughout nearby villages. 

I moved to a city to attend school after living in Chignik. I don't think I could ever enjoy living in a village now, but I really do value learning how to harvest and prepare food from the land. I'm proud to be Alaska Native and have grown up in the village, because we are people who know how to survive in the harshest of conditions and work together as communities to help other families too. Villagers are very strong, independent people. "

"It's tough, we are a trauma informed community that have survived genocide (cultural and regular), dehumanizing policies, be stripped of our resources, and our voice in important matters that dictate our lives. 

There is one channel on television, many people from my tribe don't have running water, they continue to melt snow or retrieve it from wells. The public education is a joke, how I learned anything in it baffles me. 

There are few jobs, few health resources, a bloated and corrupt tribal government getting rich off of its people, politicians and influential people talking about us like we are dead, racism. 

There is untreated addiction written off as stereotypes, sexual assault, rape, sex trafficking, domestic abuse, suicide, and extreme poverty. 

But despite all this (and a thousand other details) it is the most beautiful, culturally rich and interesting place. I would not want to be born or grow up anywhere else, it's a unique experience that not many people can fully appreciate. Despite the conditions we have been placed here by colonization we continue to survive. 

Because that's what our cultures teach us. They have kept us alive this far and now it's my responsibility to continue informing our communities about how and why we are in the current situation we are in.

The fact that we still don't even have control of our image ( I.e. Mascots) or we remain outside of politics and policies that govern us and the land that we held sacred for thousands of years is ridiculous. 

The reservation is where I will return to help my people because they deserve much, much better. Despite the constant trauma in my community, my tribe remains resilient and I love them so very much. "

"Good points but it's... tricky... and more complex than anyone can imagine... (I'm a educator and NZ Maori - the indigenous people of New Zealand). Let's take the example of 'quality schools and hire quality teachers', ok * Do NA want this? What would be the goal of it? For students to be 'successful'? What does 'successful' look like for NA as opposed to the rest of US society.  Whose curriculum would it teach? In what language would it be taught (as a language is the vessel of the culture)? The pool of fluent language speakers who would also be capable of being a teacher, let alone a quality teacher is vastly smaller than what can be drawn from in mainstream society. Could you transplant a quality mainstream teacher into a NA school and expect them to be as successful? It takes generations of teachers, professors etc to build a 'culture of teaching' in any society so they will try, and fail often before achieving this vision - will they be allowed to fail or will they be expected to be instantly successful? With the dreaded performance pay in education I can't see this being allowed to happen and that they would need to meet mainstream targets and metrics despite having a potentially vastly different system - and if and when they fail funding would be withdrawn... The list of challenges is HUGE! Oh and remember that NA are not an homogenous group (no ethnic group is) and there will again be a wide range of views, understandings and aspirations within that.


Example: A recent lecturer talked about how her father went around the Pacific Islands 30 odd years ago and did amazing stuff setting up schools and getting the majority of students into University - those islands lost an entire generation who went off to study in NZ and then never returned to the Islands as 'life was better' in NZ. Devastating for those parents left back at home who had their dreams set that their children would return home and 'modernize' it.

Some people go to the courthouse and just sign their marriage license and leave married.

Some people have a friend officiate a ceremony for them, and then have a notary witness the signing of the marriage license. 

Some people who belong to a religious organization have their congregation leader/religious official perform their ceremony. And then the religious official witnesses the signing of the marriage license. 

All of these things are marriage. The end result is exactly the same. The end result of all of these scenarios is marriage. It also ends with two people, with two witnesses, and some sort of official, signing a marriage license which will then be filed with the local government. ***Marriage is not a religious ceremony distinct from a civil union.*** They are one in the same.

I was the kid, at 18 my girlfriend was 29, and my biological mother was 32. I was adopted though.

My parents of course thought she was taking advantage of me, and thought that she only wanted me for my body / money / stability.

They were wrong, and eventually grew to enjoy ehr company, over the next year or so.

She became just another part of the family, until she ... we broke up.

Now I'm 23, with an almost 21 year old, and we're all as happy as could be."
"Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me if I saw a Koala in Wolverhampton (UK). Gets weird around these parts."

Well atleast she doesn't have social anxiety. Most people I knew at 13 didn't even say a peep from how nervous they were in public places.
"wat

This isn't a matter of survival, they're going to an extremely expensive and exclusive college when they could simply go to a cheaper university. Plus it's already been discovered that most highly exclusive colleges practice grade inflation to make themselves seem better, so it's not even a better education most likely. Doubly so for a field of study as subjective as performance arts."
I see what you did there 
I wonder if she realised there was another way to let people know where she was going.. Almost like an inbuilt blinking light controlled by something in the car...

The weirder thing is that I had this dream for 4 years every night non-stop. It became a routine that I can't stop having.

"This reminds me of my brother's story: they were getting it on in his car in a secluded spot when a campus security guard my brother knew knocked on the window. The guard (recognizing the car) said ""I know what you're doing, but you can't do it here man!"" My brother, being the smartass my dad raised us to be, replied ""what are you gonna do about it?"" The guard (probably) flashed a shit eating grin and blew his traffic whistle, then said ""now everyone knows what you're doing, might wanna get going""

"To be fair, if they have a some kind of mental health problem or learning difficulty of some kind, they may well have problems keeping organised on paper.

I have aspergers, and before I had a computer, I was hopelessly disorganised. I'd write stuff down in a planner, but then I'd forget about them. Even when I got an alarm to set to remind me to do stuff, I'd forget to reset the alarm for the next task. Nothing I tried worked to get me organised.

Then I got a phone, and from then on I've been able to set something on a calendar, set a reminder for it, and then forget about it. It's especially useful for things like money where I can just set a reminder that goes weekly/monthly for any bills I have. And it's even better now I can sync my calendar between all my devices. I'm now one of the most organised people I know.

I'm not sure where you live, but if your client does have a learning difficulty/mental health condition, then it may be worth recommending they go speak to an assistive technology charity or your government's welfare department and seeing if they're able to provide something that'll help.

It's also possible that they're just stupid though."
"I think we're both circling around the same basic point. 

Problem is, what if we are wrong about all of quantum, or all of physics, and that's why we can't find this connection,
and the 'actual' answer is forever locked away from our understanding?

We could be on the right track, and gradually our understanding fills in the gaps (e.g. Higgs Boson). But who knows - we could just be observing things which are technically correct (like there are different types of quarks, or that electrons exist as probability functions), but actually missing the point. 

To be honest, its just a thought exercise so there's no tangible answer is there.

"I hope this is taken as a fairly considered opinion, even if not a popular one. I have no issue with medical use at all. I don't think mass legalisation just like that, is a good idea, i think a structured sensible stepped approach (regulated, taxed like alcohol and cigarettes, approved distributors and licenses) is a better way. I see it coming, though it may take some time to mature. 

Then, as time goes by, we get accustomed to it being socially acceptable, people learn to behave themselves appropriately around the stuff, we relax regulations a bit more, let more people in on the growing game, give licenses to craft growers and gently make it no more offensive to the public than enjoying a nice bottle of wine or a fine cigar. 

The problem now is the culture is still too tainted, gangs, dealers, addictions, gateway to harder drugs and all that negative element to just suddenly open the floodgates and let it loose on the wider public, who largely, in my country at least, don't smoke it, or are apprehensive of it at the moment. 

We have had political parties bring it up before here, and it has never been wanted enough by the general public to get them voted in because its not a priority and we have bigger fish to fry. If the public actually wanted it, i believe they'd get it."

"When I was 18 I was with a 43 year old man. Alot of people said all the things in this thread, he got my attention by knowing I had a -face- and talking to it. The guys my age? My face was about 8 inches lower &gt;:( all the time. Every single one of them. I was built like a brick shithouse by the time I was 14. Trust me by the time I was 18? I was DONE with guys my age.  We had a pretty decent relationship (one of the longer ones I was in.) We split up when I moved across the US. No daddy complex, no daddy give me money type thing. Just a normal every day relationship. He treated me like a person, not just T&amp;A and guys near my age weren't capable of that yet. I've noticed as I've gotten older the age of the guys I'm with gets closer to my own ;)  "

Dexter needs a foil to keep him in check. Otherwise he's just a blood-soaked Mary Sue with no development.

His whole code is evidence of a deeper morality that supercedes his desire to kill. The way Harry manipulated Dexter's propensity toward violence is the hinge on which the whole thing turns.

I myself have never smoked it so I can't describe the effects but if it really just relaxes you, I don't understand why people need to smoke it so much. There are plenty of other ways to relax yourself without smoking something. Everyone talks about how smoking weed helps with some treatments and use that as an excuse when they don't even have that condition which bothers me. Also, I really hate the smell of it.

The most the President can do is send a bill back to Congress instead of signing it into law, but even that can be overruled. The rest of his job is making sure the bureaucracy functions and negotiating with foreign governments. He is also responsible for making strategic decisions for the military, though that tends to come with a great deal of Congressional oversight."

"I think I remember reading somewhere that, due to the relatively ""young"" age of the universe (even though it's probably the oldest thing in the universe) and the time it takes for star systems and planets to form and then for life to form, our planet could possibly be the first life bearing planet. Maybe there will be an explosion of life across the universe as it ages and more life sustaining planets are properly formed.

"European Catholics in general were surprisingly aggressive in the 30s. In Czechoslovakia, they lobbied for mobilisation and ""a preemptive strike against the German threat"" since at least 1936, and labeled everyone who disagreed a weakling and a public enemy as bad as the Nazis. You could find similar militancy in other European countries as well.

It's fascinating when you think about it. I've seen someone explain that they felt Christianity was threatened by all the new world developments, and that they wanted the old pre-WW1 world back with its stability and traditional values. Not that unreasonable when you think than in just 15 years, there was the rise of both Nazism and Communism, and the Great Depression rocked the world."

Since Game of War's company paid to play this ad frequently before all videos on YouTube, most of the people without ad block were constantly forced to listen to them rambling about ""TheLegend27"" so eventually it became referenced in YouTube comments and became a widespread copypasta.

"After reading a *ton* of books and listening to interviews and whatnot with writers and producers, I can take a stab at how this made its way into a hollywood movie:

1) Some producer came up with the idea and latched onto it as a sticking point, not realizing it wasn't true and thought he had discovered the greatest idea ever. Later, he probably realizes it isn't true, but being a stubborn son of a bitch and the sole guy in charge, he decided it was the hill he wanted to die on.

and/or

2) The writers knew it was a dumb idea, maybe intentionally made it a dumb idea, because they knew that wasn't what the movie was *really about* and the excuse to predicate the action sci-fi-ness was just a throwaway excuse. They didn't think anyone would notice or really care, the same way that it ""doesn't matter"" what caused the zombie outbreak in zombie movies because it's not *about* that, or that you don't find out what's in the briefcase in pulp fiction. This sounds like a good idea when you're going in to a screenplay, and a lot of times it would work, but I think the gaff here is that instead of making the excuse not important and unknown, they made it the whole predication for the film and it was *stupid*, instead of unknown.

In hindsight, a really dumb idea, but a lot of times you can have whatever stupid catalyst you want to get the movie going and most people won't care. 21 jump street is a beloved movie, but the catalyst is absolutely stupid. Saying the miranda rights incorrectly won't let a drug dealer walk when you found cocaine on him and he fled the cops. It was stupid but people didn't care because it was just an excuse to get to the funny."

"Life doesn't ""begin"" at any point in the process because it was never absent in the first place.  Humans cannot create life we simply propagate it.  A living sperm cell from a living male enters a living egg from a living female.  

This is what drives me crazy about the abortion laws argument.  If you want to argue about when those living cells qualify as a person, fine, but life was not created and did not begin.

Edit:
And to clarify - i actually agree with Gordinhax here in regards to when those living cells should be considered a person.  If the baby hasn't been born yet no person exists.  This is no different than trying to argue about when is a house a house.  Is it as soon as the foundation is poured?  Probably not.  How about once the walls are up?  Nope.  Once the roof is on?  Once the furnace is installed?  After electrical is run?  These are all just arbitrary milestones that happen along the way but until everything is done it isn't a house.  So why then do people try to do it with babies?  Is it when the heart develops?  After the eyes are fully formed?  Once the small intestine is complete?  It's all nonsense."

"Now this isn't so much of an unsettling fact for me, as much as it is a rage inducing fact that gets me angrier than I usually can get. 

There is a grocery store chain, prominent in the northeast (it's Shop Rite), and one store around me (and maybe it's just this store, I can't speak for all the others), all the food in the hot food area is just throw out at the end of the day. That's it, just throw away. Sandwiches, burgers, grilled chicken, sushi, pastas, all different types of sides, this delicious eggplant parm. It all gets thrown out, despite the fact that it's still all good (it was all made that day). And I just can't think of a single good reason for it, I can't. I ask, why not give it to the workers? Let them have their pickings out of it. They're gonna tell me that people bust their asses cooking up all this really good food (because it is delicious, really good cooks there), and at the end of the day, they can't even so much as take home whatever is unsold (and they make so much, a lot gets left over)? That'd be some weight off of the workers too because so many of them are working long shifts, when they get home, there's hardly the time to make their own meals and many of them resort to unhealthy and expensive fast food, take out, or spending the money the just earned at work (making food), buying food at work (oh well there's probably why). I just don't get it, I can't even see what that store owners would stand to lose from allowing their workers to take food home at the end of the day (besides the potential sales to the workers, but that's not a good excuse). The workers are sorting it out at no extra cost to the owners, I just don't get it. 

Ohhhhh and then there's some of the worst behavior. When canned and bottled products have been on the shelf long enough without being sold (regardless of their dates), they empty the contents of the cans and bottles so get the 5¢ deposit on them. This means that many times, cans and bottles with food that's still good (and would have been for a long time to come) are wasted cans and bottles which should absolutely go to food pantries, homeless shelters, those in need. This kind of behavior just sickens me. I can only see this as middle finger to the hungry and the homeless around the world. It's a, ""fuck you"", to the working people who spent most of their day breaking their backs at this store. It's disgusting. "

Grandpa on my mom's side died of an aneurysm (although he smoked two packs a day, so my mileage may vary).

"The resistance are looking for Luke Skywalker and the First Order are too. The opening crawl directly references that. Think of it like The First Order are the Nazis before World War II started up. They're doing some sinister shit and preparing for it, but they haven't struck yet, so the Republic hasn't done anything about it yet, partially because they're also trying to rebuild themselves and they're probably buried in bureaucracy. Leia has personal ties to this conflict so she's heading up the Resistance on the down low. Because if the New Republic isn't going to resist the First Order, someone has to. Someone has to find Luke before the First Order does. 

And the galaxy's fleet isn't in one place, but several places. All of which are destroyed at once. But- we may see that the entire fleet isn't destroyed as the remnants of the new republic consolidate into the Resistance. "

"&gt; And it's so weird that nobody ever talks about it.

First, plenty of people on Reddit *do* talk about it; it always comes up in threads like this.

But mainly, that shelf life is virtually certain to be measured with at least five digits of years and, from what I can tell, quite likely with six digits. Potentially even seven digits even if left to its own devices.

*Edit*: actually I'll strengthen that. I'd say it's all but certain to be at least six digits, and seven is *well* within the realm of possibility. The most recent eruption was 640,000 years ago, so that'd be a little over 1.6 million years between eruptions. That's right in line with past history. There are four eruptions of the Yellowstone hot spot [listed by wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano#Known_supereruptions) that span just under 5.4 million years from oldest to most recent; that's almost 1.8 million years between them on average.

*Edit edit*: actually that's too *opt*imistic; that's only counting VEI 8 eruptions at the Yellowstone hotspot; there's a VEI 7 eruption in that range as well, which would drop the average to 1.34 million years; still not that much under 1.64 though. Two other VEI 7 eruptions are listed before that. One is just 400,000 years before the earliest listed VEI 8 eruption; that would drop the average to 1.15 million between eruptions, on average. The other is just under 12 million years ago -- that would raise the average to about 1.9 million years between eruptions, but there are a couple reasons I think it's fair to exclude that.

10,000 years ago, the Bearing Strait passage was only beginning to be closed off, having been traversed by people only a few thousand years earlier. The start of the bronze age is much closer to now than then; 10,000 years ago is roughly the start of the neolithic age in the places of the world where that started at the earliest.

10,000 years from now, probably either humans will have largely or completely wiped themselves out or else have colonized several planets and moons in the solar system, and the only people that will have heard of the United States will be history majors.

At the timescale of the Yellowstone eruption, it's more than conceivable that we will have harnessed the power of Yellowstone both to get the power itself and in the process delay or prevent the eruption from happening."

"Getting pretty annoyed of writing entire pages for you only to get single sentence replies, but hey, guess that's what the ideology boils down to right?

&gt;Justify your claim that ""white privilege"" is a racist term

I've justified it several times, if the word ""thug"" was ONLY used to describe Black people, just like in the 90's, you'd have people rally around the word saying it's racist. How is this any different? Again, what other ""privileges"" from any other race do you CONSISTENTLY hear about? How about that, as someone with some knowledge on the subject, at what times have you heard about the term ""privilege"" regarding any other race outside of White?

&gt;explain what you think I mean by ""privilege"" in general.

Innate advantages people are born with based on skin color or other attributes (which nobody will ever talk about outside of wealth and being White as the cornerstone of examples).

There are innate advantages and disadvantages to everything, to pull a microscope up to social issues and boil these advantages and disadvantages down to MASSIVELY generalized terms such as ""White privilege"" is in fact, borderline, if not, straight racism when it's used exclusively on one race. 

Personally, I think women are better off than men in America by a fair amount of measurements, but I would never boil every advantage and disadvantage down to ""Female privilege"", I couldn't EVER see myself describing it in that fashion as it leads itself to being straight discriminatory let alone a term devoid of nuance.

"&gt;As someone who has watched pro-black protests check themselves and expel black members who were sexist or homophobic, I've got to say that you're straight-up wrong.

Lol, wow, they threw out people that were sexist or homophobic? How about borderline racist? Considering that's what the term ""White privilege"" is, I'm guessing when it comes to SJW topics like sexism, homophobia, or trans-phobia, I'm sure they'll devour themselves at time to time, that means nothing compared to the broader topic. Also, do you attend these marches? It kind of gives a clue, maybe you aren't a rabid SJW, but you're certainly adopted much of the mentality, just without the rabid part. You seem to be keen on painting me as if I simply haven't spent enough time around these groups, but have you ever thought that maybe you just do the opposite and have picked up a broken ideology?

&gt;Intersectionality is the cornerstone of modern feminist ideology.

Yeah, intersectionality in the sense that feminists need to fight for the oppressed races such as Black people, not that Women need to check their own privilege, or that they need to check the privileges of minorities, only that White people = oppressors, Black people = oppressed.

You still haven't addressed how this is supposed to work for any race other than White, do Asians, South Africans, and even Blacks have privileges as well? And why are they not talked about? Why is the term ""White privilege"" essentially all that I hear, and I have NEVER EVER NOT ONCE heard someone within the community you're talking about speak about ""Black privilege"" when it comes to certain specific advantages?

It's identitarian bullshit is what it is, and will separate the races more than it will bring them together around anything. I don't get why people like you think this ideology should become mainstream, while not wanting ""White pride"" groups and the like to appear as well as shit like Nazism with it, when people are constantly browbeaten into being made to think they have innate, overall privilege, while the race has MASSIVE suicide rates and other issues, people are going to rally around the race not out of hatred for others, but because they genuinely feel discriminated against.

"The thing that unfucked me the most, and that makes me able to read about stuff like that nowadays without freaking out was realizing it doesn't matter. This is a woefully simplified explanation but basically I realized I can't think my way out of conscious experience. It doesn't matter how many articles I read or thoughts I have that I'm not controlling my own mind, or even if it's true, I still feel like I am. In a way the obsession IS a symptom of the panic disorder, trust me man I went through the same thing. Once you transcend the panic associated with these thoughts they won't bother you. For a long time I tried to just distract myself but that wasn't satisfactory. The thing about panic is that it feeds on itself. You have to feel it, let yourself feel it, and accept it. Feel the panic but go about your day and don't fight it. And it fades. The less you fight it the less you feel it. I know that sounds like weird maybe shit advice but I'm speaking from experience. Just embrace that feeling, say fuck it this is how I feel, is that gonna stop me from eating breakfast? Then, rather than trying not to panic, you're making breakfast. And maybe you feel like shit but fuck it, feel like shit. Embrace the shittiness. Cuz the more you try to figure out what's wrong, the more you try to not feel the shittiness- I've said that already. I think the most concise way to convey it is that the feeling you're feeling isn't the feeling itself, it's you trying not to feel it. You're panicking about panicking, and it's a vicious cycle. You have to learn not to fear panicking, so that it will no longer make you panic. It takes time man. But once you conquer that you can worry about the nature of consciousness and all that if you still want to. I think it's important though to realize that no one really knows what it is or how it works, and yet here we are. You and I and everyone else can ponder it all we want, and yet we'll all still feel like humans because that's how we were designed to feel. No thought is going to tip you into insanity.

"This is closer to the truth.  Warhol didn't worship commercialism.  he acknowledged its power and influence and wanted people to SEE it.

He deliberately picked items that EVERYONE had in the house.

Everyone had a can of Cambell's soup.  Everyone.

Then he took that ordinary object, common to us all, and changed it up - made us look at it in a new way.

His art can be a little jarring for people.  A Cambell's soup can is red and white and has gold lettering- everyone knows this.

He turns it blue, red, yellow and green.  He MAKES you look at it, and you feel uncomfortable because this representation is WRONG somehow.  This basic staple that we honestly ignore and accept as being as proper a part of our environment- as natural as grass or trees is an artificial construct pushed us by advertising and we've allowed it this status.

He breaks that.  he makes you look at these things- these soup cans, these coke bottles.  And hopefully he makes you realize that these things are not a natural part of your world- you've been duped into thinking they are a part of your culture - but are they really?

Or are they just products of advertising?  Things.  Deliberately and expensively inserted into our collective consciousness.

"I'm not okay with having a threesome in a relationship -- period. The point I was making is that most men I've been with want to use the fact that I'm bisexual to their advantage to suit a fantasy of theirs. Sadly, it's not my cup of tea. I like to keep my relationships very monogamous. I'm considered a ""boring"" bisexual to most of the people who know it.


 The point in me mentioning that I would only want a MMF threesome in response to the MFF threesome question is to prove a point, not a counter offer (as Copyright135 said). At that point in the conversation it makes whether or not they're using my sexuality to fit their fucket list fairly clear. Threesomes are, in my mind, a casual hookup thing like canwewinthisweek mentioned. I believe in commitment to one person, only one person, and if something got boring there's a world of sex to explore that doesn't involve a stranger/acquaintance in my bed. 



And for the record, the last threesome I was in was all women. I have no preference when single as long as everyone's clean and clear-headed. :) I was on my lunch break, so sorry for the late responses. "

"My stepson is a well-meaning 20 year old and I've been in his life since he was 8. He's nice to his friends and his family and is really a good person. He voted for Trump in his first election. I just can't imagine from where he gets his political stance. When I ask him why he voted for Trump he says things like, ""I'm all about marriage equality and jobs and helping the middle class realize the American dream, bro"". (not in a disrespectful way, he calls me bro because I let him and it's funny to us.)

So yeah, my stepson is either a Trump supporter who voted against his own best interest like most Trump voters who don't understand what Trump was actually running on because he never actually announced his platform, or he's trolling us hard.

Are you trying to start an argument?
"electricity is way more expensive than in the US and many houses are older than AC so central AC is generally non-existant in private homes. 

Non-new or non-luxury hotels usually have window units. 

Until you go to central and southern Italy, AC is not really necessary either because at night the temperature is okay for sleeping and during the day it never gets so high to be dangerous, unless you're in a badly insulated tower block in a city in a place like the Padan Plain, in which case you probably need it to sleep, or have a fan blowing on you. 

Single-family homes are generally built with concrete or if older big stone and concrete walls , so if you air the house at night and seal it during the day you can keep the internal temperature comfortable. 
Around the alps and north of the alps towards germany this is almost always possible because hot weather is unstable. 

I also have to add that all windows in non-northern Europe except for idiotic glass palaces have exterior black-out shutters so if you close them during the day the sun really cannot get in. AFAIK this is not the case in the US so you're forced to use AC even in more moderate climates. "

"Sex, entirely.

When dating my previous BF, it was just ""I'm hard, I'm sticking it in your butt, cumming, and being done with anything that has to do with making you feel good.""

Sure anal feels nice, but it doesn't always satisfy me. In fact it's rare if it does.

My current GF though. Holy shit the sex is just.... happy feeling. We rub each other, kiss, hard and gentle, bite, spank, and it doesn't end if I get floppy or start when I'm hard, it just does. 

The best part by far though is the loving, needy rubbing. She's soft and I have a perky butt. Easy to please each other."

"A lot of people get away with doing a lot of shitty things. Men when faced with evidence and the police are called are more likely to be punished. However, even if not, if a female tells people that her ex was abusive, they will automatically believe her shun the guy.

However, the reverse doesn't happen at all. A girl either has to be seen by witnesses or video taped to get arrested. Even then, people (luckily not everyone, but a majority) will probably laugh at it and not treat it the same as if it was the opposite.

So enter Crowley and Cas for the teleportation and other crazy things humans can't do, all so that they can keep fighting stronger threats.

"I was taught it was a culture clash. The Native Americans had no concept of land ownership, so ""owning"" land was as laughable as owning the air you breath. Colonial and frontier Americans commited genocide against the Native Americans, eradicating or shuffling them off to less desirable places to make room for their Manifest Destiny - their so called God given right to claim any land they can see or touch. Early Americans kidnapped Native children and raised them as colonials (albeit undesirable ones) in a deliberate attempt to destroy Native American cultures. Armies were mobilized for the express purpose of this genocide.

Undeniable atrocities were commited against Native American tribes, and in an effort many generations later to make things right, tribes were granted patches of land where tribes would be left in peace to preserve what remained of Native American culture and way of life.

It wasn't a fair fight between two warring states. What was done to the Native Americans was criminal and akin to the genocides of contemporary Africa: detestable and indefensible."

"I smoked for 15 years.  I was able to fully quit smoking by vaping, and have been vaping cigarette free for 3 years now.  I know its not healthy, but i am confident in my research that its marginally safe.  People put much worse in their bodies, even unintentionally in the cities they live in, the air they breathe on the job, etc..  A lot of studies done recently saying that they still produce formaldehyde and other toxins, have all been debunked.  For example one of them tested the vapor after holding the fire button for 30 seconds.  99% of vapers arent taking longer than 3-5 second hits.  30 seconds you are BURNING cotton, which is obvious then why there are chemicals.

I have no intentions to quit vaping anytime soon, i enjoy it, and dont really give a fuck what others think.

I'd disagree. We're finally starting to see Tyrion's limits - he's an excellent politician and good at plotting but when it comes to military strategy he's obviously under-experienced (which is why Dany needs people like Jorah and Jon). It's also showing the fine line that Dany has to walk and the inner demons that she has to fight. It was easy for her when things were black and white and she was freeing slaves from slavers but now she's dealing with people who's alliances are shaky and morals are gray.

"There's a relatively simple proof using Cesaro sums that I will try to articulate. Or you could watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww).

First, lets say S_1 = 1-1+1-1+1-1... going to infinity. What would this sum be? Well, it could be either 0 or 1, depending on what the last number in the sequence is. The sum oscillates between the two extremes, so we could logically assume that the sum is in between. Therefore S_1 = 0.5 or 1/2.

Next, lets say S_2 = 1-2+3-4+5-6...infinity. To solve for this sum, lets add it to itself but shifted over a column. 2\*S_2 = (1+0)+(-2+1)+(3-2)+(-4+3)+(5-4)... which gives us...1-1+1-1+1-1...which is our S_1! So S_1=2\*S_2 and we know S_1 = 0.5 so S_2 = 0.25 or 1/4.

Finally, we have our S_3 = 1+2+3+4+5+6...infinity. Lets take S_3-S_2 = (1-1)+(2--2)+(3-3)+(4--4)+(5-5)+(6--6)... = 0+4+0+8+0+12+0...which is basically 4\*S_3. So...

S_3 - S_2 = 4\*S_3 (S_2 = 1/4)

S_3 - 1/4 = 4\*S_3 (Subtract S_3 from both sides)

-1/4 = 3\*S_3 (Now divide both sides by 3)

-1/12 = S_3"

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

I'm not trying to shove religion in your face, trust me I am not a religious person, but it does help with the anxiety. That's exactly why religion exists, people have been anxious about death for thousands of years.

"A lot of reasons.  Most of it boils down to a concept of purity politics - where groups will try to push people who don't match their personal vision for their group, in order to achieve whatever 'pure' vision they have.

For the LGBTQ+ community, bisexuals are pushed out because they aren't seen as ""gay enough"". In black communities, people with lighter skin/mixed race may also be pushed out because they ""aren't black enough"" (this has it's own word, called shadeism).  You can also see this with religious and political groups too - but almost universally purity politics are bad, because they just splinter up groups, make us all less accepting+diverse and also weaker to fight against serious issues that need a unified voice (or unified vote)."

Why would a god who has all the power in the universe not create the creatures in it based on the physics and biological rules he created.

"&gt; Op said ""animals that don't have an influence on humans"".

Actually Op said ""animals are of no benefit to humans"".

There's a slight difference in that, and how we view ""benefit"" vastly changes the response.

We can look at mosquitos and say ""These have no benefit to humans."" We don't eat them. We don't have them as pets. They can't be harvested as resources. They can spread deadly viruses. At the very best they're annoying. Ergo, we should wipe out all mosquitos.

We can also look at mosquitos and say ""These have a benefit to humans"" because they benefit other species, which in turn have benefits to us. They serve as a food source to some species, which are used by us or serve as pets, and others are food to another species, which are used by us or serve as pets, and others are food to another species... etc etc etc.

It's easy to look at something, see no direct benefit, and believe no effort should be wasted on them. It's more difficult to look at something, see a long chain that results in benefits, whether through nature or through more abstract means, and see at least one benefit."

"I'd have to qualify farmhand as something that depends on the farm, especially if you have never done that kind of work.  It's pretty grueling.  Hauling in crops, haying, or raking means dawn to dusk go go go in the blazing sun, severe sunburns, dehydration, heat exhaustion, and stroke come into play.  Plus, IME, you're under the table and day labor, so you're going to get stiffed here and there, especially as a teenager. 

If you're working with livestock, your chances of getting hurt physically go way up, since on top of the regular manual labor, you're contending with the wildcards that can be herd animals.  I mostly worked around horses, and got banged up six ways to Sunday more than once, with the most memorable being kicked *through* a fence while charged with restraining a stud.

All of them said, ""How do you do?"" or ""It's nice to meet you,"" or something similar EXCEPT for one woman who said, ""....oh!"" We avoided her for the rest of the day. But at my age, I no longer give a damn what people think; in fact, I don't think I ever really gave a damn. When I was young, a dear friend who was straight, pointed out to me that when someone is pointed out as gay, the image in peoples' heads is a sexual image, whereas the older you get, the image is more about companionship and I think there's a great deal of truth in that. That said, I think that kind of ""imaging"" is no longer really prevalent but it still exists. I've always been fiercely independent but I've never been ""in your face"" about being gay. It's just one aspect of who I am, not the predominant aspect by any means. Over the years I've lost family members and ""friends"" who didn't approve and I couldn't care less. It's their loss, not mine. The friends and family who are still in our lives take us as we are and love us for who we are. And that's the way it should be."

Even one drink will technically put you ""under the influence"" so frankly this argument is rather weak. Not trying to start a heated argument, just pointing out that any amount of a mind-altering substance will put you under its influence. The severity of the influence varies depending on your tolerance level and how much you use how fast."

"I disagree, if the apology is done well. I was bullied by many people during junior high school, and particurarly by this one asshole. 

Finished school, years went by (8 to be exact), and I had already let go of those bad times. Still one day I noticed my Facebook announced a contact attempt, and it was from this one asshole. He said he was really sorry about everything he did, and how he didn't realize it back then and all that. Didn't try to make any further contact other than that, and it was it. I answered him I'm over their bullshit and how he should move on with his life too.

Up until that moment i hadn't realized that I didn't necessarily need the apology, but it helped me finally close that chapter in my life and it felt really good. Seriously, if you think the apology may help even a little, I say do it. Just don't expect any form of friendship or even an answer back, but they will read your message and hopefully get a smile out of it. We all make mistakes."

"&gt; The Cosmic microwave background (static in between stations on the radio) is proof that 13.7 billion years ago, the universe was much smaller and hotter.

According to our current understanding of things. Yes, it's especially strong evidence that fits out theories phenomenally well, but it's not proof inasmuch as there could be an alternate explanation that fits more data better. The concept of scientific proof is not a particularly valid one as there always exists the possibility that the universe is fundamentally different than we believe it to be and all of our great theories that fit the data so well might not be the best explanation.

That said, the idea that all hypotheses are valid is absurd. There are hypotheses that fit the data much better than others. Just because we don't have enough information to be 100% certain of one hypothesis doesn't mean that other hypothesis are just as valid."

"Depends on where you are...

Some places, the doctor gets a fee from the hospital (salary) on a consistent basis to keep him on staff.  He also gets money per surgery from the patient, depending on what is done.  And, potentially, money from drug companies or similar for using their tools/methods/drugs.

If it were the case that his salary for the year was, say, determined by the number of cases at the hospital (and thus how valuable he is/how much of his work is in that hospital) it'd fit this use-case.

But I know there's at least one place where there's a pool that's based on surgical profits, and it's divided by time in the OR per doctor (or something like that), so... yeah, those guys directly get paid for surgeries.  Which also means they're sorta eager for them, which may be its own problem.

"My SO is Bi, and I'm a lesbian. It wasn't until we started dating that I realized how much flack Bisexuals get just for being Bi. It's like they're taken as indecisive or a threat to fully gay people.

I couldn't believe it when I started hearing from my LGBTQ  friends that ""she just hasn't made a choice yet"" all of this amplified when I had mentioned that I was the first girl she has dated. My SO is 29 years old, I am 24, she has had more than enough time to figure out what she likes. This is just super insulting coming from the people who are aware of how much courage it takes to identify anywhere on the LGBTQ spectrum.

I had to explain to her the community and how she was probably not approached by many lesbians because unfortunately lots of lesbian women have run into being a ""test run"" for Bi Curious women. I could tell it really hurt her that she felt as if, if she only identified as one or the other she would somehow have a more (for lack of a better word) ""legitimate"" sexuality. Bless her heart because there's no way she's willing to compromise who she is to be accepted by anybody. 

She gets the whole ""you're Bi so you must like threesomes"" even her ex who mentioned it when we first started dating and quite a few people there after. THIS is super insulting. She's as monogamous as they come and people need to learn that Bisexuality does not mean sexually promiscuous. It's rather insulting too to see such a piggish comment made to someone. It would be like saying to a straight guy with a girlfriend ""you probably always pressure her into anal, that's what straight guys do right?""

It doesn't leave the body when you die, unless you are talking about byproducts of someone's last breath or the like.

We decay; that's where it goes. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

""Our"" energy isn't something unique. It just so happens to be contained within our bodies at any given point in time. We don't ""own"" ""our"" energy."

the other meanings are philosophical, perhaps sentient life is the only way in which the universe can experience itself? in the end we are a part of the universe as much as the universe is a part of us. if there were no sentient beings there would be no one around to appreciate it. we give the universe meaning."

In 2013, nearly 18 of every 100 middle school students (17.7%) and nearly half (46.0%) of high school students said they had ever tried a tobacco product (including electronic cigarettes).

In 2016, about 7 of every 100 middle school students (7.2%) and about 20 of every 100 high school students (20.2%) used some type of tobacco product (including electronic cigarettes).

"The ""great"" thing with PKU is that you ""just"" have to control your diet. Eat special dairy, special pasta, special bread, and no meat at all, plus an amino acid supplement, weigh everything you eat and consult tables. It's a bit of a hassle, but on the flipside, there are virtually no impairments at all if you do follow that. Full physical and mental capacity.

Until now, this would have been unheard of here. North Dakota is a very conservative state, but this sort of racial politics had never really happened here until recently. And even then, North Dakota decided we didn't want it here.

Three years ago, North Dakota pushed a man trying to buy up entire towns for the purpose of turning them into white supremacist communities out of the state.

Now we've come to the point that there is going to be an actual rally in the largest city. I'm sure someone will say ""But what does that have to do with Trump?"" and to them, I will reiterate: This sort of thing was unthinkable in North Dakota until now. Over the past year (starting with the election), it's gotten to be a bigger and bigger issue. Typically, North Dakota doesn't make a big deal out of almost anything. And now we have this."
"I believe the situation developed because the aircraft used what are called ""wet wings"" - wings that have fuel tanks in them to extend range. This is perfectly normal these days on large planes, but these particular ones didn't have the structure and skin of the wings sufficiently strengthened to tolerate the additional weight or stresses caused by this feature.

I don't know if anybody knows exactly the physical process that occurred for this accident, but my best guess would be that, given the reported fuel leak from the wing, the wing structure began to fail/tear in flight, and the rip got worse and worse as they flew. Eventually, it either got bad enough to rip off the wing, or the rapid change in weight from the leak threw off the stability of the aircraft, but either way it resulted in an aerodynamic break-up of the vehicle."

"I hope you are in a red state sir.  I am not.  I would be going to jail 99%+ of the time, probably even if I drew on him.

But for the people asking the question, there's more than just the way the law is written to consider:

- What would the investigator think?
- What would the jury think?
- What would the issuing Sheriff think?

I'm in California, for example, if I carry in San Francisco (I don't live there fwiw, and they don't issue CCWs, but I can carry in any county in CA) there can be absolutely no ambiguity at all if I used my weapon.  Even then, I still run almost a certainty of being charged, and a reasonable chance of getting in some amount of trouble.  For reference, a Fire Chief from a red county here in CA was traveling through Oakland with a valid CCW.

But I was told by people who prefer to stay divided that the world doesn't work that way, that it's impossible. I say if the world doesn't work that way then why accept it? Change the world, make it into a place where everyone can have a good life and a bright future. Don't just accept horrible things because we are overwhelmed, fight it, take control and make it so.

"The problem with nukes is that if it breaks up the asteroid without altering its course, the problem could actually get worse. But for one that we were unaware of until it became an imminent threat, that may be one of the only options. 

However, if we know about it a few years in advance (such as the many thousands of asteroids already being tracked), there are much safer options. The further away it is, the smaller the correction needed - just fractions of a degree. Some plausible ideas include putting rockets or solar sails on the asteroid itself, parking a spaceship nearby to gravitationally nudge it, or even just painting one side of it white to increase the effects of solar radiation pushing against it. With enough forewarning, it really takes very little to change their path just enough to avoid Earth.  "

"The US not going to war against the Japanese in this alternate timeline may not necessarily be a given. 

The US involvement in the Pacific war was due to a set of circumstances that started with the Japanese. The Japanese invaded China and made plans to invade the rest of the Far East. The Great Eastern Co-prosperity Sphere plan would still be in action and this turn of events would have encouraged the Americans to cut off oil exports to Japan. 

It is possible that the Americans would not attack Japan if Japan managed to leverage its newly-invaded territories to replace the oil supply that was lost by the American embargo and the Japanese military didn't go on with their boneheaded idea to attack Pearl Harbour, but this wouldn't be a given.

I worked for the government out of college on a special Native American veteran program that helped Native American vets get funding to build homes and I visited many reservations in the Midwest.  Pine ridge is by far the poorest.  I remember my first time there dogs running everywhere, trailer homes just parked and run down with dirt and junk all over inside them.  Meth was a big issue at that time as was alcohol.  Crime was high and you would be wise to keep an eye open at all times.   These were all the negative things.  But... then on the other side there are lots of good people who are trying to keep the culture and traditions alive.  I hope they do.  Native culture and language and translations need to be upheld and not forgotten.

"It's both totally unclear to what extent memory is a function of the brain and not the larger body/nervous system (for instance tactile or muscle memory, etc), and totally unclear that even if the brain is exclusively where activity related to memory happens that that activity is not an emergent process form neurons firing and other biochemical and bioelectrical processes rather than something physically 'hard-written' into the matter of the brain itself.

It is certainly a matter of academic suspicion.  You simply choose to believe in some faith-based vision of the mind as an analogue to a digital computer.  The fact you use the word 'encode' to talk about memories makes your faith obvious.  It is an active theory.  But there's no evidence that supports such a theory. 

Problem is, we still don't have a good, near-universally accepted, working theory of the mind.  You can presume we do all day long.  It doesn't make it so."

"I'm kind of agnostic on the issue.  We got enough problems in the world that weed is like number 12,382,384 on my list of things that matter.  I'm really not sure if legalizing it would be good or not.  I don't like crazy draconian criminal sentencing, but I'd rather fix that with all nonviolent crimes and drugs rather than just focus on weed specifically.

Why am I not sure if legalizing it will be good or not?

I've seen prostitution go from legal to illegal in one city firsthand, and I know it doesn't stop it, but it does get it 'out of the mainstream' so to speak.  That is, it's no longer advertised everywhere and in your face right on main street and everything.  It becomes not something that businessmen can just do at lunch or whatever.  Doesn't mean it's always safer.  But it really does make it less prevalent.  Downtown is no longer full of brothels.  

That said, I think the punishments now can be way too harsh.  There still are states where you can get a life sentence for weed.  That's ridiculous. 

But I also don't buy into the stoner bullshit or the propaganda.

I've smoked marijuana before.  I know for a fact it is harsher than tobacco.  I know it makes you cough more.  And I'm sure it's doing great damage to your lungs.  We're in the middle of trying to make smoking tobacco illegal for health reasons, it seems goofy to make smoking marijuana legal in the process.  And don't give me the stoner line about how smoking weed is not as bad for your lungs or doesn't cause cancer.  Bullshit.  Everything causes fucking cancer.  Booze does.  Cigarettes do.  Fucking cured meat does and that shit's delicious.  [Smoking weed definitely causes cancer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2516340/)

So many stoners have told me smoking weed not only doesn't cause cancer, but that it cures it...and that's how I know the drug has serious long term detrimental affects on cognitive ability.

That said, I also have friends and loved ones who have gone through periods of smoking every day.  They become different people.  They do become addicts, even if they're not physically addicted.  Once you use every day, you not only act reserved and different, but you really do start changing your identity to fit the culture.  In almost no time at all, you end up showing outward signs that you're a regular weed smoker.  Shirts/hairstyles/bumper stickers/music/whatever.  Something gives it the hell away.  No matter how much you think you're just normal while you smoke every day, you're really a different person.

That said, I've also known people who just smoke on occasion.  No more than once or twice per week or so.  And they can be just normal.  I guess it's no different than booze in that way.  If you start drinking every day it's going to show too.  It's actually even worse for you to drink every day, I'm certain.  So I'm not advocating that either.

I do think it should be available medically.  I've seen first hand how it can help chronic pain/illness people ween off of opiates, which are worse.  They're still all foggy because they're high all day, but at least they can take a shit every morning and not nap 12 times per day with weed...not so with opiates.

But I just don't know that we need another unhealthy industry marketing to everyone.  It's bad enough to have all the bars and shit we do.

I really wish people would put half the effort and money they put into weed legalization into exercise programs and games for people and healthy food for families in food deserts and shit.  There are many worthier causes.

In the end, I think it's a really not important issue.  It doesn't matter much to me.  I could vote either way on it.  Would probably depend on the details of how they were going about it.

A lot of them smoke and make up some excuse that it's natural or even traditional and I think it's just a whole lot of bullshit.

Besides, weed is from Asia or something.

Not to mention most of them are just selfish. They only care about ""tradition"" when it matters for them. They use it as an excuse to get in fights with non-reservation kids from the city over, but like hell if they ever show up to community events and learn some stories, or go to the native art exhibits that get held every once in a while.

They're only tribe when it benefits them. But they never do anything to help the tribe out. And we're always there, they just don't care about the rest of us. We had community service events where we worked with archaeologists and students from a university to do some excavation out in the mountains. It was supposed to be a fun week-long event with food and singing and learning about our past, but a bunch of them were just really disrespectful the whole time and it was so embarrassing. One of the boys accused the college students of being racist, just so his parents would let them go home early.

"Everyone here touches on the myriad of reasons

My dad and his sisters got out, but my aunt once told me something that I won't forget. ""Sadness is in our blood"". I think it is a telling thing. People don't want to leave the rez since their family is there and despite the poverty etc, the only thing worth a damn in the world to them is their family. So rape, drugs, powerlessness, it creates a downwards spiral. Kinda like a mega form of poverty, but with the constant reminder outside your window that the world sees you and your family as lesser beings.

My tribe has claim to 32million acres of beautiful mountains in norcal. We got 100 acres in the original deal and have been buying it back systematically. But the struggle creates anger and distrust.

I also suspected that even several days after having a few I would still be slightly negatively impacted by it. After a month sober I can definitely say that not drinking has had a massive positive impact on my mood, mental clarity and overall feeling of well being.    Now for sure this does not apply to everybody but I think there is definitely a group of people out there who are just physiologically not compatible with alcohol and would absolutely benefit from cutting it out.

"Yes, added sugar. Lots of foods have naturally occurring sugars, like fruit and milk. But if you're eating over 30 grams of added sugar, you need to dial it back. That includes putting honey in your tea, or drinking soda, or eating candy. Basically, if it doesn't occur naturally in whatever you're consuming, it's added."
"&gt; Our view of the Universe is actually what it looked like anywhere from thousands to Billions of years ago -with no way to see what it actually looks like ""right now"".

Given how we perceive time, I wonder if it's any use talking about time like this (in more objective terms). Since language is a convention regardless, surely it's more useful to talk about what we are seeing as ""now"" and scale to the past when it's useful (i.e. physics) rather than the other way around."

"We as Americans get bombarded with the message that America is a destructive and evil influence in the world and that the last just war was WWII. The message is that the people who see America as a threat is literally everyone in the world, and our allies are just our allies because they fear us.

We get told by the world that we're racist, sexist, bigoted, uneducated, fat, and pretty much every negative stereotype under the sun. We kill cultures and replace them with McDs, we cause problems by clashing with Russia and China, we support ISIS, we are the bad guys.

Even today I'm hearing everyone talk in the office about how horrible Americans are, how they're all uneducated, how could they do this, they destroyed the country. We constantly get bombarded with messages about how America is basically full of evil and hatred.

Yes, we are the bad guys, and yes we can fix that. We can make our oppressive crime rates go down. We can stop imposing our military will across the world. We can stop exploiting third world countries by sending jobs overseas and bring them back here.

Trump took the hatred that was thrown on Americans every day by media both internal and external and fed on that. When you've had it drilled into you that you stand alone and everyone hates you, why would you not turn inwards and let everyone else fend for themselves? All you got from it was hatred."

"Transpeople should not take part in sports that is based around their opposition gender. Let me be clear, I do support people who suffer from dysphoria and what they do with their body isn't any of my concern. However, letting a transperson who was previously a male take part in women's sport invalidates the achievements and work those women have put into their profession. For example, a transperson took part in a ufc fight against a woman and won. The woman was quoted as saying 'I felt completely overpowered'. A transperson took part in a women's powerlifting competition and destroyed the record by 30kg if I recall correctly. What is the point in encouraging women to take up sports, work hard, destroy stereotypes if a genetic male can just come along and undo all of that?

I realise that women are better in some sports than men. Typically this is athletic sports such as rock climbing and gymnastics rather than strength based sports. This does not remove the fact that all this effort has been invalidated. Also I would find sources the examples I cited but I'm currently on my phone. "
"I'm not sure what point you're trying to argue. That the nukes used in 1945 were city killers? Yes I agree.

Also fat man and little boy were the first ever atomic bombs. 

Current generation nuclear warheads are not designed to destroy cities - because there's no strategic value or need. Should the need for nukes ever arise they will be used on farms, military installations (why do you think NORAD was built inside of a mountain?) and critical infrastructure like water treatment plants, power generation, command structures (think Pentagon/White House)."

"Because ST still, after nearly 50 years, has not made any specific, testable, disprovable predictions. String theory is still 'just' a theory, small ""t"". There are still major, strongly competing theories and frameworks within String theory... even among the many scientists working on it. Much has been made of the elegance and beauty of ST, but we now have thousands of PhDs that were granted on the basis of ST research, nearly half a century of work done in it, and still nothing predictive or testable. The best cheerleaders ST has will happily tell you that we probably won't be able to properly work out the real equations of a REAL ""String Theory"" for more than a generation... and some of them think it will take longer. 

I routinely tell younger people interested in ST to read Greene's ""The Elegant Universe"", and then to read Smolin's ""The Trouble With Physics"". It is important to learn about the idea from a guy like Greene, who is completely in love with it... and then to read some strong critiques. The funny part is that Smolin himself doesn't hate ST. He just hates how much time is being burned on it when there are very, very good competing ideas that might be turned to experiment much faster. "

"I used to live on a rez in Canada. My parents are from 2 different tribes, but I've grown up off and on rez and have been to both ""town school"" and ""rez school"". I went to preschool and kindergarten on rez and learned my peoples language, culture and traditions at an early age. I ping ponged between schools in elementary due to bullying and my mom converting to a new religion that made her strip herself my siblings and I of our native culture and identity really. It was a confusing time. I'm always very jealous and amazed watching pow wow dancers. I was a little jingle dress dancer, but when my mom converted she threw out everything of our ways including my little shawl that was made for me. We didn't live on rez, but when my mom passed away when I was 9 we moved with a family member on rez and I went back to rez school for a few years. I loved the sense of community and feeling like everyone was family and always being connected somehow, we used to go on random ventures into the woods as kids, walking along the creeks and river, or running through the fields not being scared of anything. I was pretty shielded from a lot if the crazy things that went on. My mom didn't struggle with any substance abuse, neither did my aunt although my aunt was crazy abusive. Our rez was about a 15-20 min drive from town, and there was a store on rez but i think it got shut down. There was a family who would buy shit in bulk when I was really young and they had their own store, saving many a hitch hike to town. I remember going to town school for good and feeling so behind, I didn't know a lot of what they were teaching at that time, but I caught up. When I was 16 I left for the city and I have only been back to the rez for funerals. I graduated on time, went to university right away. I dropped out in my 3rd year though; life happened. I'm glad i left the rez, It hurt me a lot back then.  I left a lot of my friends who were more like my other sisters and brothers. I left behind a really comfortable place to me. But now looking back at it there was so much bad things happening there that i didn't realize, a lot of people that left never ever go back. I just met someone a few weeks ago who is from another tribe outside the same town we are from and she said her elders warned her not to come to my rez because our people had  a lot of pain that never has been dealt with or something like that. And I was like whoa man she's totally right, there was a lot of funny business going on. Even now, I drifted apart from all my friends back then moving 4hrs away from home, and a lot of them are in the cycle or passed away from overdoses. And they're so young. It's heartbreaking. A lot of them are pretty unrecognizable in the states their in, it's insane seeing their photos and stories appear on their social media sites. 

It's a sad reality and though my perspective is super mild and seems almost irrelevant compared to other stories on this thread, I'm glad I got to read some of your guys' experiences too. I had no idea of a lot of lifestyles and conditions other bands were in. My rez was not perfect by any means, some rez have paved roads like what! We had dirt roads and knee deep pot holes! But some people had no running water or electricity? Wow. I Feel very ignorant and stupid for not knowing how a lot of other people grew up it's such a kick in the head. That's how I grew up though, and what I know of my culture is things I learned when I was a kid on rez. When I moved away when I was 16 I feel like I left that traditional part of me behind. I know you can always learn and take steps yourself to grasping your cultural roots but I feel like that's easier said than done. "

"Execution is more costly because of litigation and them getting retarded and overcomplicating the method. If you want someone dead I could do it for 20 cents.

Lol what the fuck do you mean ""isnt compatable with a modern society"". If you torture and kill a single person, let alone methodically imprisoning, torturing, assaulting, and eventually murdering multiple people, you have lost any right to life anyone says might exist. I get confused sometimes by ""modern society"" because killing a fetus is fine.

Christian Identity - 21

Neo-Confederate - 43

Black Separatist - 193

General Hate - 100

Note: the groups tend to check more than one box, so you can't add them up without double/triple counting.  Eg, a single white-nationalist group is likely to also be counted as anti-LGBT and anti-Muslim and General Hate (and possibly others), for example.

"&gt; Eugenics gets a bad rap because of the awful things done in its name, but the overall idea of encouraging very intelligent and naturally fit people to procreate together is not by itself abhorrent to me.

That's how it starts out, and I know this is a bit of a fallacy argument, but it's a slippery slope. 

Encouraging ""good people"" to procreate is only 1 half of the coin. It's like Germany's youth camps where they would let Aryan race kids frolic unattended and make babies. 

The other side of the coin is prohibiting the ""bad people"" from having kids and that's where it all goes wrong. And you can't really achieve your goal without having both. 

Plus, good luck identifying the good people and the bad people. Humanity has been doing that for thousands of years and it is always a bunch of crap. IMO, your genetics make up like maybe 1% of your potential to be successful in life. The rest is just circumstances and privileges that appear to be tied into race. "

For me, it's that girl/girl isn't as valid of a relationship. My husband told me he's okay with me making out and hooking up with other women. We're not in an open relationship and we are happily monogamous. I don't think he'd be cool if I hooked up with another guy. Why would me being with a woman be any less valid? Cheating is cheating."

"Ok so here we go: [X] is the person I was in a relationship with.

Spoiler: Not a native speaker. Maybe I makes small mistakez.

I was still studying (Engineering), [X] was working (not an academic job, completely different field). We did the same sport and that is how we met each other. We got along pretty good, fun person and really refreshing to be able to talk to somebody who is not also studying engineering. 

We started going out, doing the sexytime, having good times. 

Then I start doing my master's thesis. The final project before I will be an engineer. I put my heart and soul into it because I really love what I do. 

When we are out, [X] asks me something like ""Hey, what exactly do you do there?"". Of course I am more than happy to explain every detail. I tell [X] everything. I am on fire!

[X]'s reaction: Eyerolling and ""oh my god, if only I had not asked"". 

Wow. that hurt. It's okay to stop me and say something like ""can you do the simplyfied version? Because I really have no clue"" or something. But you just saw me pour out my heart about the work I am fascinated about and THAT is your reaction?

From that day on I noticed the little things. Normal conversation: ""How was your day?"" - ""Good. As usual."" - Silence.

[X] did not realise that I want to talk about my work, my day, my thoughts. [X] was not interested (anymore?).

Even my father did. He once approached me and said ""You do realise that [X] is just not ... on your level, right? [X] does not share the passion you do. For nothing. The only thing [X] is really interested in is horseback riding.""

And in the back of my head I knew he was right.

Took me 8 more months to get out of that relationship. Because I just could not get myself to do that. We had 1.5 years of relationship. We separated in peace, we both knew that this was leading nowhere. I moved to a city 700km away. We are still in contact and I value [X]'s opinion. But we just have different lifestyles and expectations from life, apparantly.

tl;dr: When you realise that your partner is not your friend, he/she is not your SO. There can be a difference and you should watch out to actually have a SO and not only a person to spend time with."

"My point is that whether or not his memory is based on racism as you obviously imply, he absolutely did not say ""all mules are Mexican""; he said that *he remembers* Mexican mules. Maybe he assumed it, maybe he was told, maybe he made it up. You're basically demanding that he apologize and admit that his experiences don't describe the entire world. Why don't you ask him nicely to expand on his memories instead of telling him that he's intentionally dishonest and racist?"

"I'm bi, and I've met a lot of gay people who think we have an easier time because they think we can somehow choose to ignore our attraction to the same sex and ""pass"" as straight which is ridiculous, just because a bi person might end up with the opposite sex we can't shut off same-sex attraction, it's still there and most of us wish we could be open about it without being judged and stereotyped by both straight and gay people.

Also most people I know initially identified as bi when they were first discovering their sexuality and then realized they were fully gay so I think some people just think that's the case for everyone. Hell, when I first came out as bi when I was 14 I genuinely believed based on what I'd heard that I'd magically turn into a lesbian once I was comfortable enough with my sexuality. Nope, am still bi at 29.

"Sleep has been proven to help retain information learned during the day. This is the main reason why we do it.

Some research has suggested that nightmares, in early humans were manifested in order to practice scenarios that might occur in real life, such as being chased by a wolf. Modern nightmares are things like getting fired from your job, involved in a car accident, falling of a building etc. other reasons for nightmares are also manifestations of your fears, for this same reason (although the brain may not be able to distinguish between rational and irrational fears).

One final reason we sleep is to rest our bodies. Studies have shown long sleep deprivation can cause people to go insane, and even kill them! We sleep so that the necessary period of rest to sustain our active body can take place."

And their cages have to be completely enclosed (unlike the guinea pigs), so feeding them is a pain in the ass with all the opening and closing. They don't even get all that excited about food. The guinea pigs are loud and appreciative; the rabbits just sit there and get to the food when they feel like it. Every time I think I've connected with one, they kick and scratch me.

"That's a nice saying, but there is probably no way to determine whether or not that's true. In fact, it's almost certainly NOT true. There is anthropological evidence to show that war took place in areas of the world which had had no previous contact with other areas where war also took place. At the very least, this shows that war was invented in each of these areas.

In fact, group hostilities have been shown in non-human animals, as well, suggesting that it may be a pretty easy concept to come up with. It could very well be just a natural extension of sufficiently large communities."

The short answer is, a machine gun really isn't that type of weapon. If I try to point a machine gun at individual targets on the ground I'm really limiting its effectiveness.  I'm wasting the whole point of it being able to lay down a heavy rate of fire.  

Its more efficient for me to use the machine gun to ""fix"" guys, that is shoot near them so they have to drop down to a crawl, then let my buddies with rifles pick them off.  

Now, at the same time, yes I may try and walk my fire towards them and get some guys too, but it depends on the situation.

"&gt; for the implication to be true the first part about it being Thursday must be true for the second part about being hanged on Friday to be true.

Just want to point out that logically, a statement that begins with a false assumption always holds (ex falso quodlibet).

The prisoner's fallacy here is not a false assumption but that the logical model he created was incomplete. In particular, it didn't account for the impact of his conclusion on the situation. That's the paradox, that as soon as he draws any particular conclusion, he sets himself up to be surprised by any other outcome.

I don't think that the ""clever"" solutions work, either. If he expects to hang every day, then by Wednesday he's already been proven wrong and is again susceptible to surprise. If every day he says, ""Today is the day"", I believe that's cheating, and we might as well have the executioner break the rules as well and knock on his door at midnight or something. "

"I think if your parents knew you were gay/bi/etc it would help reshape whatever negative feelings they may have. As long as they don't sound like they're blatantly anti-LGBT, I think coming out to them would help them get their acts together and be more sensitive to LGBT culture.

"Which is great and all but the developed world started a path towards ""food, water, the most basic healthcare and some semblance of stability."" hundreds, if not, thousands of years ago. 

It took us a very long time to get to the point we are and the resources required to get us there were taken, abused, destroyed, rebuilt, stolen, fought over, etc. The countries with high infant mortality rates are either dozens of decades behind the developed world or logistically do not have and cannot get the resources to grow to the point we are at today.

We are essentially talking about a population that lives in a different time period than us and the steps it would take to get them where we are today would have to begin now and grow over a century or more. 

**TL;DR:** Basically, it won't happen overnight. They are today what we were 2,000 years ago. The difference is that they have more people because the ONLY thing we give them reliably and charitably is medicine.

"&gt; I think a totally free market would work,

This is the point I'm failing to get across.  So long as there are limited supplies and inelastic demand, there will NEVER be a free market when it comes to health care.  

Free markets are generally a good idea, they should be the standard, default solution to any given problem involving trade.  However, one of the things schooling at every level spends very little time focusing on is the fact that there are certain situations where free markets cannot exist.  Cases where there is fraudulent activity, where natural monopolies occur,  where agents are acting without free will, or other forces (such as inelastic demand) are at play precludes the possibility of a free market."

Let's see... substance abuse is out of control, groups of people loiter outside of nearby businesses, practically begging for money [understandable, honestly]. Hunger is common, and the rez dog population is immense - we don't have any form of animal control, and they're all aggressive. This prompts people to walk around with sticks or bb guns for self-defense that brings a sense of unease even though you *know* it's specifically for self-defense. 

Hunger was also a huge factor in my own life until my dad and sisters managed to find work

I hear of violence between two or more people occuring on an almost daily basis, kids roam the streets in diapers unattended, and even shootings have become slightly more common lately. It's hard to drive through town and see trash littered everywhere, plus the same group of people doing various types of substances near a local gas station every time I go to fuel up. My mom made the issues very clear to me as a child, but it seems normalized for everybody else around this area.

We're taught that drugs and alcohol are bad at a very young age-- *very young*, but that goes out of the window for a lot of people in high school since there's literally nothing to do unless you're a shut-in. Another issue is that if you try pick up the trash, it'll come back twice as much; you try to do things for the community: it remains the same nevertheless. Work is also almost non-existent.

It's like purgatory, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have at least some fun growing up. Our high school was decently funded, and the teachers were so laid-back I loved it. I also went to Denver, CO for my senior trip and it was like heaven compared to here lmao

"I've only worked on a few games, and they're rather niche, so you probably haven't played them.

The best stuff to work on is exactly the same as the best rule books to learn the game from. After all, I'm learning the game just like a new player, so the easier it is to understand everything, the easier it is to edit. The worst stuff is when there's a 20 page rule book followed by a 20 page rules reference. That makes editing extremely tedious because when I have a question about how something works it's not immediately clear the rules need to be edited -- it might just be something covered in a completely different document. A lack of redundancy is especially bad. Read stuff on ""actions"" in the main rulebook and something isn't clear. Go to check the ""actions"" section of the rules reference and it isn't clarified, so now I think an edit needs to be made. Nope -- publisher discussed in in the ""combat actions"" section of the rules reference, which was 3 pages over from the ""actions"" section. I just think that's a terrible way to design rules, but it's what some folks prefer."

"The fermi paradox really isn't a paradox. This is because it is based on faulty statements.

The first statement falls by the sun being a relatively rare star.

The second statement falls by there being no real definition of 'earth-like'. Merely being rocky and in the goldilock zone isn't nearly enough. I think that the chance of a planet like earth, with its composition, hot core, large moon and jupiter as a protector existing is exceedingly small. It also claims that earth is typical, which is ridiculous, since we have nothing to compare it to. The chance of intelligent life coming to fruition could again be exceedingly small.

The third statement runs into the steps we needed to take to get to interstellar travel (which we haven't yet). Stuff like oil being created, metals being workable, plants being the right type of burnable and a myriad other things that you need to get to space travel means that it could very well be exceedingly rare for civilisations to ever develop powered flight, let alone space travel.

The fourth completely skips over how long a few million years is. Humanity has existed for a hundred thousand years. We stopped being hunter-gatherers about fifteen thousand years ago. The idea that we could start a trip that takes a hundred years is out of the question, let alone something that takes a thousand years. Thinking in the terms of millions of years is quite simply ridiculous.

So if I add all those things up, you end up with a rare sun, two unlikely steps and a third step that is, as far as we know, impossible, and I am suddenly not at all surprised that we haven't seen any extraterrestrial life."

We all are. No-one feminist wants you to feel guilty for being born straight, white and male. That's another strawman (this thread is giving me hayfever).

What ""SJWs"" want is for people to *recognise* the privileges they didn't ask for, and the lack of privileges other people didn't ask for either.

Take a rich kid as an example. Did they choose to be born to a rich family? No, and making them feel guilty for that is nonsensical. *However*, if they choose to actively pretend they have no advantages, and act in a way that further entrenches their advantages whilst not helping others (even if they aren't specifically targetting others) then we might think that they're a bit of an asshole at least.

It's this same line of thinking that makes people upset when they learn a lot of the nuclear arsenal is still driven by older machines and even floppy drives.

"Eh, every older generation has worried about every younger generation as long as there have been people.  Young people have ALWAYS been reckless, thinking they're going to live forever, and latching onto some fad or fashion that old people hate.  Old people have always fretted that young people will never grow up and get serious about the real world, and will bring down civilization with their pettiness.  Seriously, you can go back in writings for thousands of years and find the same stories told over and over again.

Even if lots of young people don't consider their mortality and existential thought now, they will later."

"I live in Canada where everyone has access to healthcare. The struggle is finding a doctor who isn't going to send you for an HIV test every time you have a sniffle, who you can talk openly with, who will accept the fact a same-sex partner may want to be present, and things like that. It's the same thing for mental health; Finding a psychologist or psychiatrist that is accepting can be difficult but is important as you need to be able to talk freely in those situations.

"My aunt was very healthy at 66.  Fell over at home and complained of a headache and issues with feeling/control over her legs.  Went to the hospital to get diagnosed with a brain aneurysm that ruptured.  Had two surgeries that initially seemed promising, but she passed less than 2 weeks later. Luckily the two weeks was long enough for her kids and her siblings to fly/drive to see her at the hospital and say goodbye. 

The idea that it could happen to me at any time has frightened me ever since.

"I agree, but I don't think we can blame individual people for not making this connection. Eating animals is so ingrained in our society that it takes a lot to question it. It's difficult to accept this argument because it means admitting we are complicit in a horrible crime and we should change habits we have had all our lives. I do think things are changing, for example /r/vegan is growing very rapidly. "

"They dont have a right. Yes it is literally criminal.

"Completely.  The biggest tool for ending racism in this country is ending affirmative action (wait, there's more) and expanding social safety nets, single payer healthcare, and single payer college.  Take away the leg up that being born to the middle class gives you and suddenly poverty will no longer decide your future.  Eliminate the biggest factors in turning to a life of crime and watch crime go way down and education go way up.

Also watch as ending affirmative action no longer penalizes asians for being too high achieving by incentivizing schools to accept only enough minorities for Title 9 tax incentives and none more."

CLAIM:   When U2’s Bono announced that every time he clapped a child in Africa died, someone from the audience told him to stop doing that.


	FALSE
EXAMPLE:   [Collected on the Internet, 2002]


[Collected via e-mail, 2006]
Bono, whilst playing a gig in Glasgow, got the whole crowd to be silent and then began slowly clapping his hands. He got the crowd to clap along for a while, the stadium quiet except for the rhythmic clapping…

After a short period Bono spoke, saying that everytime he clapped his hands a child in Africa died …

Suddenly, from the front row of the venue a voice broke out in thick Scottish brogue, ending the silence as it echoed across the crowd, the voice cried out to Bono “Well stop fucking doing it ya sick fuck!!”

It's a hypothetical example of how small facts can have huge legal consequences. More like a legal thought-experiment. It's not a real story.
"We pretty much know what we don't know. For example remember a few years ago when the Higgs boson was ""discovered""? This ""discovery"" was an announcement of a confirmation of a theory with a certainty of 5 standard deviations. This means they are 99.999999999% sure that the theory is correct. You may think that there is stil that tiny chance that it's wrong. But the catch is that this tiny amount is known and predictions and decisions can be made based on that likelihood. This is true for all scientific measurements. We know the likelihood of each theory and make future predictions accordingly.

In your example of a cat wondering about a TV the cat may understand that the TV gets hot and that there are some moving images on one side and there are noises from it but it doesn't affect it so it doesn't care about anything else the TV does. A human could take the TV apart and find something familiar but I don't think many would completely understand how it works either. For that you need a lot of humans collaborating. Cats cannot collaborate in that level. (Or can they??)

Anyway. We can quantify how sure we are of some explanation. Our current models for the very small (quantum world) and the very big (astronomical scale) do not fit together now with our current observations. There are some explanations but they aren't anywhere near the certainty which is required for a theory to be usable."

"As they should, I live in Alberta, so I can't comment for the rest of the country. I'm a child of immigrant parents and was born and raised my whole life in Canada. 

Growing up it felt strange hearing about race problems happening in the States as I personally  have not personally dealt with anyone discriminating me based on my skin colour, everyone understood that we were all Canadian. Now though I have realised that people are just better at hiding their racism, especially towards Aboriginals. I makes my blood boil hearing the comments that people I thought to be decent say about Aboriginals. I hear it coming from people who aren't white too, from other immigrants, and people who themselves have faced racism, and it just boggles my mind. I don't understand how others don't see the person just the people. 

Whenever Aboriginals come into the store I work at, I now notice how most of my co workers treat them slightly worse and when they leave comment on how they had obviously just gotten their welfare cheques in, that they are off to buy booze and drugs next because ""it's how they are"". When they hear about how black people are treated, they come to the defence saying how it's not them but a product of their surroundings, their upbringing, so on and so forth. Yet, the moment a person of Native descent does something wrong or doesn't have a job it's because they are all like that, they just want handouts; but their upbringing in reservations is just as bad.

So yeah comments like these should change how  you view Canada. Racism is alive up here, it's just casual, accepted, and hidden. "

"&gt; Are we doing this for them, or are we doing this to keep their culture around, as we keep animals in a zoo?

I think this is as much about non-Native governments trying to atone (which, at least comparing atonement to the reason for it, it's too little/too late for that after more than a century of trying to erase their culture) as it is about Native people not trusting those governments after what they've done.

Sending officials to ""study"" their culture, especially if the end-goal is to force assimilation (which is what the boarding schools were also doing) is definitely not the right answer imo. Doing so both would mean acceptance of and actively taking part in the end of their culture (which is what many of them are trying to prevent) and supporting the work of the same governments that put them in an unwinnable situation in the first place. That isn't to say that doing so would possibly mean portions of their culture being documented and historically saved, but assimilation (either willing or forced) still would cause irreversible change to that culture, and ""saved in the history books"" definitely isn't the same as ""currently thriving.""

That said, I'm not sure what the ""right"" solution would be either, or even if there is one (or at least if there is one that doesn't involve generations of work and stability to achieve)."

I reckon there might have been a subconscious backlash there.

"Had a client, who was a wonderful man. I come from a skin and beauty background and after he came, I massaged him and noticed a mole on his shoulder that seemed dodgy. I asked him about it and he Kinda waved it off like ahh just a birth mark.
Before I left himself out the door, I looked him dead in the eye and said please get it looked at.
4 months later,  he's come back and books me. Upon him taking off his shirt he reveals A massive dent in his shoulder where I remembered the mole to be.
My eyes bulged and was gobsmacked. When I finally looked at him. He was silently sobbing. I turned and hugged him and he held onto me for dear life and explained that he had a routine check up at the drs the day after seeing me and decided to listen to Me and have it checked out while he was there.
Turns out if he had not had it seen, he would have dropped dead in about a month. And had to have a massive long surgery and radiation to kill it. He sobbed and poured his heart out to me and apologized for not taking me seriously. He spent the rest of the time massaging me.

I had another client who had come in with the intent of 'if my night is shit with a hooker, I'll just end it after'.

I have the tendency to pick up body language. I'm not psychic or believe in that crap. But men show a certain body language when something is on their mind. I talked to him for a bit before he booked me and he had explained to me that his mother died, his gf left him because he couldn't cope with him being depressed, watched his dog get hit and lost his job within a month. We chilled out in the bubble bath for a couple of hours, massaged hum, gave him some much needed tlc and just some light in his life.
2 weeks later, he came back and booked me again for a few hours. As we got back into the room he told me to close my eyes. When I opened he had a present for me,it was a box of fairly expensive chocolates and a card that he had written his undying thank you to me.
In it, had had explained to me that if a sex worker had given him a experience then he was at a loss for life and was going to end his life on the west gate Bridge (in Melbourne Australia). 
I sobbed my heart out and hugged him tightly. I told him that I'm glad I could give him some light in his life as to not end it.

Then I was arrested, and hospitalised, and started receiving treatment. When I got out, I couldn't bring myself to contact anyone. I was so ashamed by my behaviour. Then there was a short road to being jobless, and homeless, and self-medicating. And no one wants to be around for that shit."

"Fellow Alaskan native who grew up in a village on the kuskokwim river. The worst part about being from a village is growing up hearing about how WE have to stop the sexual abuse/rape/domestic violence with our people then growing up to watch what happens when it's reported. The victims are shamed. Treated like shit. Family and life long friends turn on the victim because it's uncomfortable and puts their family/friend in trouble. 

Moved to Fairbanks in middle school and literally couldn't function in a school bigger than my village. So I switched to a school with curriculum based around native culture in 10th grade. 2 of my classmates have gone to jail for murder. A good 85% of them are down town drunks/meth heads. We have so many good programs to utilize but we still need to do so much more for our people. "

That said, developing a dependency on these forms of aid is very common, which can easily turn into a cycle of poverty."
"My theory is that they're deliberately doing a cast reboot on OITNB because it had sooooo many second- and third-tier characters who were never going to grow or change or become plot relevant again, but had to keep getting written into episodes anyway.

"It wasn't just that, it was the arrogance of her campaign.

She basically blew off every state that voted for Bernie because she was butthurt that he dared to challenge her and she lost.  It was her ego that said she'd pick whatever his name was, like it matters instead of Bernie.  It was also her blowing off everyone by assuming that they'd have to vote for her.

I had 38 people in real life and online tell me that I should vote for her.  As a BernieBro it was downright insulting because 37 of the 38 had the same message; ""Vote for her otherwise you're voting for him!"" and that is not inspiring to say the least.  I wrote in Bernie knowing it was a throwaway protest vote, but I wasn't going to vote for her when it was so obviously rigged.  The one person who gave me reasons cited her foreign affairs record as Secretary of State, her performance in the Benghazi hearings, and her actions when Bill slept with that intern.  One out of 38 said positive things about her.  Not a good record.

"My aunt is Aleut. One of the many misconceptions about native people is the notion of tribal money. Very few tribes in the US are wealthy enough to dispense money to registered members, so it's largely a myth. One of the exceptions to this, though, is the Alaska Native Corporations, some of which are pretty wealthy and members do get money from this. The thing I'm still confused about, though, is casino money. My father (non-native) deals cards at the local tribal casino and I've never understood how that money gets distributed to members, if at all. 

Can anyone comment on this? I'd also like to know which other tribes have enough resources to provide money to their members."

Another mate then informed me my very much black out drunk reasoning was ""Well, see this bird is stupid hot and the only way I'll get on that is via this threesome business, so I figured I had to atleast have a little go at a fella to see if I could hack it, so I started on the easy level, one with tits, a skirt and a wang atleast 3 times as large as my own...in all respects.

I can't imagine someone actually arguing for this ideology without thinking it through a little bit first, and extrapolating it to groups they've been told are ""oppressed"" such as Females of all things. It's the entire reason I said you'd probably completely ignore the benefits they have, it's like a religion, it's not like you haven't heard my argument before, or haven't heard any of the benefits Females are given in our society, you just flat accepted at some point that they were worse off without anything to go by and ignored any of the counter-arguments, or didn't even search for them which may be even more worrisome.

I won't consider you a stubborn SJW for simply not arguing, at least you did that much, but I will consider you a ignorant SJW for taking up this ideology without even questioning it yourself first. Sorry, it honestly just irks me how people pick up such a thing so quickly, it honestly is a religion at this point with how much blind faith people put into it. "

"Haven't seen it on here yet, but Prions. Prions exist out there, and they are uncurable, 100% lethal, and . If equipment that is used for neurosurgery on a prion bearing patient is used on another, it can be transmitted to that other person. This is because prions can't be destroyed entirely by conventional sterilization. And on top of that, they can do some creepy things. For instance, Fatal Familial Insomnia. Once it onsets, it leads to progressively worsening insomnia that eventually leads to death, with things like hallucinations, paranoia, dementia occurring along the way. This one can be tested for and caught before it manifests with genetic testing, but nothing can be done about it. Then there is Kuru. Starts off with difficulty pronouncing words (disarthia), decreased muscle control, nodding or shaking of your head (titubation), and some other similar symptoms. Then, during the second stage, you're unable to walk without assistance, suffer severe tremors and ataxia. You'll  start showing signs of depression and emotional instability. And the laughing. Uncontrollable and sporadic laughter. The final stage leads to all of the prior symptoms getting so bad you won't be able to sit without support. You'll then develop dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), which can result in severe malnutition. You can also find yourself unable to speak, incontinent, and unresponsive even though you are conscious.

That's definitely part of the equation. I think the other big part comes from our egos. People identify with the groups and culture that they belong to. If your culture is ""good people believe in God and go to church"", then it isn't a stretch to convince yourself ""I believe in God and go to church, therefore I am a good person"".

"It wouldn't be such an issue if we (The US) were not such extreme dick bags about how we handle a lot of our foreign affairs. I wrote a research paper for US Foreign Policy in the Middle East, and I'll be up front I went in with the bias that we'd done some pretty stupid stuff.

What I didn't realize is just HOW shitty we have been. The more and more I read the more and more I came to the conclusion that if this had happened on US Soil we'd as a population have pretty much the same reaction. Starting with WW1 and moving forward the shit we are seeing now is pretty much the seeds we sowed.

It does not make current actions right but seeing the mistakes of the past puts it into a perspective I didn't have before. The most annoying part is watching our current policy change very little and expecting to get better results. "

Pushing pressers to maintain blood pressure with a few days in the ICU. Then the recovery finally got on track and things got better.

"https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/21/11/2047/1147770/Genetic-Evidence-for-Unequal-Effective-Population

Sorry, I was a bit vague by ""ancestors"" 

Basically males are more prone to dying or being murdered. Anyone one male could make up for the loss of a few of his buddies or enemies by simply impregnating all of the available females in his social group or under his control. So, many of your male ancestors died off before breeding, a few bred a lot, and most of your female ancestors reproduced (but not in the same numbers as the high breeding male ancestors of cours).  Think of Genghis Khan. Murdered lots of guys and raped lots of women. So the population consisting of his children would have one unique male ancestor and many unique female ancestors (going back only a single generation of course). "

"Societal Equality.

Ideas like inherent Privilege and ingrained societal castes are very astute and should be considered by many people, but unfortunately the people who care most about them tend to treat them as weapons in discourse more than ideas to be considered by all parties; ideas that can be used to push us away from those ingrained problems.

So for example, take White Privilege. This is something that is not inherently good or bad, it is simply a fact of our current way of life. Having any form of White Privilege doesn't make you any better or worse than someone who has any form of privilege, because everyone has privileges in some way or another, at least in the 1st World. It's simply an observation that should be used to help temper your opinions on others. Like a reminder that not everyone has had the same life as you, for better or worse. But unfortunately it ends up getting lobbed typically as an insult or as something that is inherently ""bad to have"", so the entire point of the idea gets lost in vitriol and hateful debate."

"An eclipse is a shadow cast by the moon on the surface of the Earth (which you most probably knew). This shadow is normally in space, because it can be cast anywhere.

The reason why the shadow only passes the Earth a few times is because the plane of the moons orbit is not the same as the plane of the Earth's orbit. For an eclipse to be seen on Earth, the moon has to pass through the plane of the Earth's orbit. Because. The planes are shifted, this happens only twice per orbit of the moon.

Besides that, when the moon passes through the plane it has to be in front of the Earth, which can only happen two times every year. This also causes the two annual lunar eclipses, but because the shadow of the Earth is way bigger than the shadow of the moon a solar eclipse is not guaranteed. The shadow can still pass besides the earth."

"-It's extremely ugly. All the Aliens in that show are grotesque and generic. The humans aren't much better. They're pretty generic too. And the squiggly pupils thing is so stupid. You can never tell they're even like that and when you can it's distracting. 

-It's really predictable and boring. The humor is almost always just vulgar or gore. 

-I just despise Rick. I have no idea how anyone can enjoy the show with him as the main character. Rick is predictable, boring,  unfunny, extremely unlikable and not well written. He's an fucking asshole, but he's not a funny asshole. I'm supposed to root for him but I just can't because he's pretty much the villain of the show. Rick can do whatever he wants and have anything happen do him and still come out on top with little to no injury.  The show has no stakes because whatever happens to Rick he'll just pull a couple of hairclips out of his ass and make a stargate. 

And he's like some kind of weird anti-character where any development is undone. I remember seeing Season 2's finale thinking ""oh shit, Rick finally sees that his actions have consequences, this is really interesting"".  Nope! Come Season 3 and destroys two governments with little to no effort or injury.

And Rick is almost never invested in the situation he's in. Why should I care if Rick doesn't care? Why should I care if Rick will be victorious regardless of what happens? I get that they're not gonna kill off the titular character (though it'd probably make the show better) but I have to believe that they can actually lose, which I don't. At least Homer Simpson would get the shit beaten out of him before he won, but Rick gets victory with no effort.

You can have a character be an asshole and still be likeable and funny, like Bender, but they have to actually be well written. It doesn't help that there's a huge oversaturation of asshole characters in adult cartoons and Rick brings nothing new to the table.

Okay fine, it's not a plot driven show, but again, the humor isn't enough to hold up the show on it's own. And rest of the characters can't either, since they're just the typical dysfunctional family you see in all adult cartoons. Summer and Morty and literally just stereotypically teenagers.

"Ive been caught 4 times.

1- Caught by girlfriends mum via tapping on the window. She was supposed to be out shopping but forgot her purse. Cue stern talking to by her step dad that night. We were at Uni so we were adults but still he werent pleased we were fucking in the front room.

2- Caught by mate at my house party. Walked in on me fucking a girl. Apologised and backed out. 

3- Caught by housemate when me and girlfriend were fucking on the sofa in front room. She weren't happy.

4- Caught by friends sleeping with girl on the beach when travelling in Thailand.

Ive defintiely been caught more times shagging but its hard to differentiate between those times and the times ive been caught wanking which is also a fair few times as well.

"People who can grill. Above xenophobia, Australians will recognize when someone's using a grill right.

I got to visit some family in Australia once, and we were at a park where all its new furnishings (grills, tables, seating, ect.) were already being used by young Korean-Australians. 

My Uncle points to them and I'm afraid he's about to say something borderline racist, but he just goes ""Us Australians like to think we can grill, but I'll tell you, those Koreans are on a whole other level.""

No anger, no fear, no frustration at the park being overcrowded or the grills being occupied, just respect"

"Mr. Clean Magic Erasers are fucking magic. Those with some comet and hot water and a bit of scrubbing will get built up dirt and grime off your bathtubs, sinks, and counters. I used to work for a housekeeping company and had to do a few ""move outs"", where the customer was moving out of a home, and I could get YEARS off built up grime off of tubs, turning them bright white again. 

Clean the insides of your trash bins, even if you typically use liners. I normally rinse the bin out with hot water first then clean it out with product and a rag.

Streaky bathroom mirror? Use vinegar. It smells icky at first but it really gets rid of the streaks. It doesn't have to he a whole lot either. 

Vinegar will also get pet stains out of carpet. More importantly, it neutralizes the smell and your pet most likely won't pee or poop there again.

Most of all though, a really good tip is to clean top to bottom. Also keep an order when cleaning the bathroom. Pour toilet cleaner in the toilet, let it sit while you clean the shower and tub, empty the trash and clean the bin, clean the mirrors, clean the sinks and counters, then finish with the toilet. Dust off your toilet paper holder (little bits of toilet paper dust builds up on it), dust off your towel racks, clean off your light switches and doorknob, and then sweep and mop the floors. When cleaning your whole house definitely leave your kitchen sink for absolute last. Don't want to dirty up a clean sink when you pour out dirty water or rinse rags."

If so, they will likely bitch about you when you are close to them to, and that's not a nice thing to have happen to you. Conversely, if they speak highly/defend those closest to them, they'll probably do the same for you down the road, and having someone have your back is always a good thing.

I'd make an exception for people that come from toxic family backgrounds.

My family's nuts, and I'm not about to inflict that on a guy without giving him fair warning and *extensive* prepping first.  But you can't lead with ""Oh, by the way, my family is fucking insane and while I will make every effort to shield you from them, by on guard at all times around everybody except my brother, and mom.""  You look insane, and the guy might not believe you.

So you have to ease a guy into it.  First step is funny stories that sort of demonstrate your family's dysfunction but don't send the dude running.  (Oh, my sister's kind of an idiot.  She had her car towed to a mall parking garage after it broke down on the highway, only to discover that she'd actually just run out of gas.  Despite the fact that she'd been driving with the fuel light on for days.)

Then you move on to general bitching.  (I cannot BELIEVE my baby sister right now.  She's got restricted car privileges because she got into a car accident that was 100% her fault.  And she lies to my mom about what she needs the car for so she can drive down to meet with her cheating ex!  This guy's set off more than one mental breakdown in her, *and* threatened to have one of her friends killed!  What the hell!)

Then you can start giving out actual warnings, because it doesn't seem as out there now that he has some background.  (This is a photo of my bitch aunt.  If she comes by, do NOT let her into the apartment.  She steals, and has a habit of getting naked in front of other people's boyfriends/husbands.  Oh, and she used to tie my mom up and leave her in closets for hours when they were kids.  So if she comes by, I don't live here and you want her to leave.  Got it?)"

"Casual Fridays. They're moronic. 

There are only two scenarios: Either the firm must present itself with a level of 'professionalism' for incoming clients that requires suits and a 'traditional' workplace, in which case, Fridays ought be no exception - client meetings still occur on Fridays, don't they? 

Or! The entire premise of having to wear business attire is flawed because the clients don't care at all how people at their desks are dressed, in which case it ought be extended to the rest of the days of the week to dress as you please. 

But having it as Fridays only is moronic, not to mention hypocritical. 

Add to this that you can't really wear whatever you want: If it were 'casual' in that I could wear what I genuinely wear around the house, I'd show up in a wife beater and dirty jeans. But that's 'too' casual, so in effect I have to dress up into something that I wouldn't wear either at home or out socializing, but also not business attire - in effect a second sort of business attire, just slightly more casual.

You gotta stop being so ignorantly assumptive that America is still somewhere near the top of the pile on this. *It is very nearly rock bottom.* Not comprehending this is willful ignorance on your part at this point of the discussion. 

&gt; In any case, your definition of universal healthcare is much broader than most and I think that's the main point of our difference. There are few, if any, countries in the world that have healthcare systems that operate in the way you're describing.

Not understanding what universal health care is when there's literally dozens of examples, including such tiny no-name countries as Canada and freaking Britain showing you up constantly, is the willful ignorance thing again. You keep calling the shitstorm in America a 'quasi universal healthcare system'; **you need to stop doing that.** No part of American healthcare is universal, and most of it isn't even healthcare. 

&gt; Think about that, a generation ago we were having people turned away from emergency rooms because they couldn't pay.

Currently you have people not bothering to make the trip because they know their family can't pay even if the hospital does manage to keep them alive. **That's not fucking better.**"

2) Work your ass off when you're young

3) Get any education you can

"He was always tight-lipped about his childood.  It wasn't until he was in his 90's that his kids convinced him to write down the story of his life.  I don't remember any interesting boarding house stories, but I do remember that a local Catholic priest became his mentor, helped him get part-time jobs, taught him how to drive a car, etc.  The priest *was* grooming him, but not the way you may be thinking.  He seemed to think my grandfather (devout Catholic, top of his class) would make a good priest.  One day, the priest took my grandfather to visit a retired priest.  When the older man asked my grandfather (then about 16) if he had a calling to be a priest, my grandfather said honestly, ""No, I want to be a doctor.""  The younger priest, who'd mentored him for many years, had very little to do with him again after that day."

"I was listening to an episode of the ""Freakonomics"" Podcast a while ago, and their guest was some Instagram star with thousands of followers. She's always promoted body positivity, and is a ""Curvy"" woman.

She decided to start exercising to lose some weight. She felt tired and was having weight-related pains in her legs and back, so she thought losing a few pounds would be good. (She's not obese, just a bit overweight.) She posted a few photos about her exercising, and the fact that she'd lost some weight already, and her followers went CRAZY. They told her they felt ""Betrayed"" that she promotes a positive outlook regarding appearances, yet was trying to change herself. She actually stopped exercising, so they wouldn't feel bad about it.

I thought that was a really stupid reaction. If they are ""Traumatized"" by her attempts at weight loss, then that's THEIR problem. If she feels that she needs to change her body, that is HER decision alone."

It has nothing in it, no bed, no books, no windows, just a hole in the corner to shit in, and a slot in the door to push food through and the woman will spend the rest of her life, locked away.

"Respectfully, I disagree.  

I don't think homeschooling is a good option, as it allows any parent with potentially dangerous/crazy ideas to raise their child with them in that vacuum.  In schools, teachers are held to rigorous standards that ensure we are effective.  What sort of standards would an active member of the KKK have to follow when teaching their child?  I know that's an extreme example, and I'm sure many wonderful students have been taught through home schooling, but I don't think it's the right move for the 21st century.  

I don't know the answer myself, I'd like to see state rules comply with one another.  Almost every state has a different idea as to what education should be.  So I'm from MA, I moved to IL, and my license didn't transfer, because of one random rule IL has that MA does not.  I think a lot of problems would go away if EVERY state sat down and hashed out some rules.  I currently work in alternate education as well... a for profit school that is just trying to milk the state for every penny they can.  Also not a good idea.

"Well, I can attempt to answer that! For one, the main problem a lot of vegans have with modern animal agriculture is that it relies on factory farming, which is not only cruel but unnatural. In the natural food chain you're talking about, at least animals have the chance to live more natural lives, be out in the wild, use their instincts, build families, etc., whereas in factory farms their lives are pretty unrelentingly terrible from birth til death.

The other point is that humans are capable of moral reasoning in a way that other creatures simply aren't (e.g. a lion isn't going to give a second thought to how an antelope is going to feel being eaten). So the argument there is that since we have the capacity to understand suffering and ethics, that gives us a responsibility to treat other life forms better."

"The early 1900s was also the greatest time in history for the working class back then, and yet people still lost fingers, so I really don't see your point on that. And if you don't feel as though you have a great work ethic, why bring up the fact that you've worked 19-hour shifts if it's not particularly impressive to you? I'm sure the point is that, if we generally aren't much more effective after 6 hours of work, and we generally don't need to work as hard to meet most of the needs of society, then there isn't much point to having an 8-hour shift: it would be superfluous if all of that is true. For sure, there are millions of people like yourself who can and would willingly work 19-hour-shifts with relative frequency, but a few million out of 7 billion is still ~1% of the population, so it's reasonable to speak in general terms here. I don't think anyone's acting as though an 8-hour-shift is difficult: they're just suggesting that productivity tends to go down, and our current levels of productivity may not be entirely necessary.

Sure there is a rare occasion that something that logically contradicts itself can be possible, but this is not that occasion. Being unable to lift something directly contradicts being able to lift it, either you can or you can't. To do both is logically and physically impossible without using the ""but god defies logic"" argument because that both changes the rules and misses the point of the paradox."

I had to drive her to her friend's house, this was about 5 years ago. It was a long drive and I was a bit pissed off because I really just wanted to stay home, play some games, maybe whack it a bit. So we're in the middle of nowhere, Ohio, and she turns to me, and mind you she's not THAT much older than I am, and she goes, ""Johnny, I have to PISS.""

Well, God damn. So my head is racing and I'm thinking, ""this is it, Johnny!"" Like I said, it's the middle of nowhere so we pull over and I let her out, right there on the side of the road. And then she just hikes her skirt up and whips her panties right off, right there, doesn't try to hide it or nothing!

"Specifically the problem lies with capitalism. Farmers in developed nations are capable of easily oversupplying world demand for food but that would drive down prices. So collectively through a series of convoluted mechanisms (such as subsidies to grow crops for biofuel rather than food) prices are kept artificially high so that farmers can earn a sustainable income in their developed country. The result however is that the poorest countries can't afford to buy the food!

I'm obviously oversimplifying the problem as local supply and local power struggles in poor countries is another big contributor to the problem. But the fact remains, we could very very easily produce enough food to make everyone in the entire world fat but instead 20,000 people will die today from malnutrition."

His wife leaving him for a lesbian really messed with his head and he has major trust issues after that. It's not an excuse, but a reason at least

I'd generally agree with OP though, in that while Ross does do some shitty stuff due to that, Rachel never tends to get called out on hers, which leaves a kinda unfair feeling to it all.

Plus, in your example of him being called into work late, was that the one where he snook Rachel into the planetarium for a really romantic evening? Because that's a pretty good way to work around that problem.. Rachel gave no workarounds when her work got in the way, and mostly just started getting angrier at Ross"

"You seek help, you keep seeking help until you find someone that can actually help you. You try medication if it's suggested that the root of your depression can't be worked on in therapy alone, then you try probably a few medications before you find the one that works best. 

You work on your every day habits. You try to remember that depression doesn't have a magical fix everything cure and you need to work on every day things to help it along. You eat better. You take walks. You try and not be so god damn cynical about everything in life because depression _lies_ and it's okay to be scared without hiding behind cynicism. 

Depression is different for everyone, but you need to find what helps for you, and the first step for that is some kind of therapy. "

"&gt;It would make sense for them to end stories like this, but they never do. I don't get it.

I suspect a lot of this has to do with the timeframe of the show.  Remember, despite how many years it's run in realtime, Piper is only supposed to be serving something like 18 months.  And I think all of the seasons so far only add up to around one year.  Hell, all of last season only covered 3-4 days.

So when most of the women around her are serving longer terms for more serious crimes, they really *can't* have that many being released legitimately.  

Which is another reason I suspect they came up with this whole ""shutting down Litchfield and separating the prisoners"" scenario.  It's just about the only way they *could* have a major cast changeover while still being able to hang onto the characters they want to continue focusing on."

He was wounded and immobilized, and an allied soldier was aiming to finish him off. The soldier apparently didn't have the heart to, and walked away. He could have killed Hitler right there.

1. If I go check the back for you, do not walk away and expect me to find you in a big store

2. Don't take anything from the bottom, it makes it look awful and might collapse

3. Do not leave meat on the shelf, especially trying to hide it.  I can smell when a steak has been hidden for a night

4. If you come noticeably on drugs, I will kick you out or watch you until you're out those doors, you know you are, do not wonder why I'm watching

5. Is it so hard to put your cart back or give them to someone and not leave it outside by a car or in the lobby

6. Shower please, I have to be within a foot of you, it's important

7. Be kind.  Don't come to me and go ""ketchup"" and then walk away as I stay where you can find it.  A simple, excuse me, where might I find ketchup is much nicer and won't make you a dick

8. Know your limits.  Old and need a case of water or short and need something on top, ASK, do not try to be a hero

9. I do not know when item come in specifically.  Could be tomorrow, could be sunday, could be some guy bought all 30 today ans won't be in until the manager does his invoices

10. The trash is full?  Alert someone, don't toss a half full latte on the top and hope for the best.

11. Don't break something and run, most of the time you won't be charged and we can write it off, but when you do this, it changes things.  Some lady just broke 50 soy sauce containers and ran away

12. We stop selling obscure products regularly, don't be mad when this day comes and we don't have Madagascar Red Ant larva

13. Control your kids, should be explanatory 

14.  No I can't give discounts on big purchases or near expiration items

15. Why ask me for cooking recipes?  Do I know a suitable replacement for cumin? No, but it's 4.29 for the cumin.  Not a chef, just a worker.

MY ADVICE: Be nicer, don't be lazy, treat us with some respect, be clean and sober."

"15, it was my second boyfriend. i just managed to get it at 15 because I was turning 16 in less than 2 weeks. I didn't take relationships lightly, and my first boyfriend, whom I broke up with 7 months prior, never got the confidence to go for it, even though I gave off go signals like crazy. My second boyfriend I was a lot more attracted to, and we had been dating about a week. He asked if he could kiss me, I said yes. In the moment, I had been drowsy (it was late), it was really hot in the room, and I didn't have as strong of feelings for him as I did a month into dating him, but, looking back at it, it happened exactly how I would've wanted it to: with consent and respect. I was a terrible kisser, of course, but it makes me really happy to replay the moment in my head, even if it had felt strange in the actual moment.

Edit: I also want to add in that I almost fell asleep and he was trying really hard to keep me up (tickling me, jokingly whining about my nodding off) so he could kiss me. It was so sweet."

"That's actually not quite correct.

There *was* a crash of an actual vessel... which was a prototype for a stealth bomber that was being developed. 

See, originally, the conspiracy theory in question postulated that the military was covering up the existence of extraterrestrial prisoners, which had been captured from a crashed spaceship. People were subtly encouraged to run with that idea, as it kept them gossiping about alien visitors instead of new wartime technologies. The mess was cleaned up, the affiliated scientists and soldiers went back to work, and a new prototype was eventually released to some aeronautical firm or another.

Nowadays, as you stated, most officials maintain that the crash involved a surveillance balloon... but a few months after the accident, an ex-scientist sold the concept for a stealth bomber model to a toy company, and a few higher-ups noticed a *striking resemblance* to the subject of a certain crash. The project was later declassified, though its connection to the famous incident has largely been swept under the rug, given that the development was taking place at Area 51... which has all sorts of its own conspiracy theories surrounding it, but which is actually just a facility for testing various cutting-edge weapons and flight technologies."

"Sure, no consequences so why the fuck not."
"I sat through the whole thing and found it insubstantial.

Even as someone who generally likes extended/director's cuts, I think half of Cloud Atlas was filler that served to lengthen the story without advancing it meaningfully.

Some of the timelines could easily have been cut from the film to make it clock in at under two hours yet tell an identical story. It's not particularly difficult to convey the concept of reincarnation. Many scenes actively avoided adding any interesting foreshadowing or intrigue, in favor of fitting in another period segment. It violated the first rule of writing fiction by forcing people to sit through what was not the most intersting period of the character's life, and not even knowing why.

If nothing further could be cut, it would have been far better off as a miniseries. It got a little bit full of itself thinking it was worthy of demanding someone's undivided attention for two and a half hours. You could see the ending from a mile away, too.

I like some visual tourism, so to speak, and enjoy good world-building. I'm also a Tarantino fan so I'm perfectly capable of appeciating a significantly non-linear delivery. Cloud Atlas attempted both but didn't do them nearly well enough to justify being as bloated and self-important as it was."

And the only reason that happened is because European powers didn't count their conquered subjects as the same level of sentience or consciousness en masse, kind of like how we view gorillas. 

It is one of the reasons why they just took whatever land they wanted abroad but in Europe they still relied on familial lines or historical claims to take territory or invade. My nation the United kingdom did awful things in its colonial past. It shames the memory  of all those who were abused and forgotten about to claim any of this was just or ""just what happens"" the colonial and expansionist era is full of ethnic cleansing murder rape and savagery that is level in horror to the holocaust.

It costs more to move them on a plane or a car because of their weight. I get this is sorta like a weight tax, I see the negative impacts it could have and I don't have a solution for how it could be rolled out without hurting and encouraging eating disorders, but how big some people are getting and are seriously being told they are beautiful (while they dry heave after going up 3 stairs) is insane.

"There is real science behind the concept of transgenderism.  Not saying there's not neohippy bull shit, too, but there is a solid scientific explanation for gender dysphoria, which is generally (though not universally) considered the root of transgenderism.

Here's the short version of one explanation:

All human fetus' start female and different parts of the fetus develop at different times so you can, for example, have a situation where a person's body defeminizes properly but the brain does not.  The result is a person with a male body but a partially defeminized brain and the mismatch can manifest psychologically as gender dysphoria.  There are multiple possible causes of this, like endocrine disorders (there's a much higher rate of endocrine disorders in the transgender community) but the bottom line is transgender people aren't just making this shit up."

"Really because those weapons had safety measures, that although 3 failed, the fourth and most important, did not. Hence, more than one safety measure. So to explain, one weapon just plummeted to the earth when the plane broke apart and did not activate its arming sequence. Good there. The other did initiate the arming sequence and even deployed the parachute. Which if you didn't know, nuclear weapons detonate above their intended target to create a larger blast radius. That being the reason for the parachute, controlled decent and detonation at the proper altitude. So although this weapon was in it's arming sequence it still never completed the final phase, nuclear fission. This produces the atomic bomb. It wasn't half assed but nuclear weapons were still in their infancy. This was bad but it also prompted further safety measures within the arming sequence to ensure we never came that close again. Mods were created and the defect was fixed. "

"Basically, my body sees the implants as foreign invaders. You know, since one is leaking and everything. So, your body is like, fuck this shit and starts attacking them. Unfortunately, as the implants are a part of my body (for the time being), the body starts making antibodies for itself, and also for my thyroid. Essentially my body is going on a rampage against itself because it doesn't know what else to do. 

The two main tests my rheumatologist did are an ANA (anti nuclear antibodies, which detects how your body is attacking itself and to what degree) and a TPO, or thyroid peroxidase (which measures the levels of antibodies the body has created against the thyroid). I know he did others, but those two are the most damning. 

And I hope you do go into rheumatology, I find it quite fascinating and important work. "

"They aren't wrong. It is hard to detect asteroids, but we have detected thousands of potentially hazardous asteroids. Nonetheless they did say IF we detect it early enough. As for deflecting one, we would need a lot of notice, probably at least a year ideally, but there are potentially viable methods for deflection. With enough notice a relatively small push should be enough. Something like a nuclear standoff device should be viable. I will concede that none currently exist, and nobody is 100% sure on the asteroid mechanics, but the technology is there."

"This one is supposed to be unsettling because it indirectly gets you to think about blood/bones. Most people are unsettled by seeing/imagining such things because generally in humanity's past past, if you were seeing blood, you were probably in a dangerous situation. Seeing blood means that someone just got killed, either by a dangerous animal, or far worse, in war. If your brain thinks you're in a dangerous situation the amygdala activates and you feel fear (unsettled feeling). 

But, tons of people aren't unsettled at all by blood."

"I just had a nightmare my toddler died. 

In the dream she had a slight fever that I used to stay up and monitor until it broke, but for whatever reason I decided to just sleep instead and trust she'd be fine. When I ""woke up"" in the dream she'd died from the fever. It was several days of me being numb, the burial process, mourning, me sitting in her room staring at her abandoned toys and wondering what I was going to do with all of it? Store it? Leave it where it was? Throw it away? Should we try to have another child? 

I woke up for real and felt around, but my toddler wasn't in bed with us (she often climbs into bed with us during the night). I checked her bed and she wasn't there. I stared at at and started to feel all around for her, picking up pillows,  checking under beds, in closets. I woke my husband in tears ""she's gone! She's gone!"" I cried. He shot up, looking through the house with me. Our baby was gone. 

I looked again in her room... and she'd gotten out of bed and fell asleep under her freaking dresser (it's on mid century modern peg legs so there's just enough room for a two year old to climb under and sleep, apparently). She's never done that before, and it was the worst timing ever. But I scooped her up, took her back to bed with me and cried for a long time, thankful she was alive and well.

The seceding states said that they had the right to Slaves and the right to secede if other states disagreed.  I really don't disagree that a state should have the right to secede, but definitely disagree with the right to Slaves.

And if you're going to say that there was also the economy or tariffs or something else - those were definitely uneven because the South was reliant upon slave labor, so it ends up being the same thing."

To clarify, less than 1% of Southerners owned slaves at the time. So one argument was ""how can it be about slavery if 99% didn't own people?"" 

Well, those 1% controlled about ~50% of the Southern economy - the work of slaves fed, clothed and sheltered those people. A swift removal of labor would've bankrupt and destroyed them.  The war was over financial position.

And white supremacy was used as justification for having slaves to begin with...

So.. it's both.

"It can happen if each player makes a different number of shots. Suppose you have 2 players, A and B, each taking 2 and 3 point shots. 

A takes 400 2 point shots and makes 200 of them, so a 0.5 average for 2 points. He only takes 1 3 point shot and misses it, for a 0.0 average. Add up all his shots and he has 200 out of 401 shots, just a touch under 0.5 average. 

Now B. He takes 50 2 point shots and makes 26, a little better than 0.5 average. He also takes 400 3 point shots but only makes 1, for an abysmal 0.0025 average, but notice that it's still higher than A's 3 point average of 0.0. But if we add up B's shots, he makes 27 shots out of 450, for a total average of significantly less than 0.5, which is also a lot less than A's total average. So now B has better averages in both 2 and 3 point shots than A, but his total average is a lot worse than A's. "

You can only go back in time, logically, if your actions in the past don't negate your reasons for going into the past (e.g. if you go back in time to kill Hitler you cannot succeed because success would mean you never had a reason to go back in time at all). You can't go back and change history, only make it what it already is.

But it's kind of a moot point anyways because so far as we're concerned time is a one-way street."

Donny is a horse that really really wants to be a unicorn. Most everyone says it's impossible, Bubbles, however, LOVES it/him because she LOVES unicorns. Some shit happens with a friendship montage for the two. They manage to sucker the professor into performing a SUPER DANGEROUS RISKY PROCEDURE to turn him into a unicorn, complete with him shrugging off the consequences and signing a paper that basically says ""WILL MAYBE KILL YOU"" without a second thought. Procedure is done. Donny turns into a rampaging monster wailing about how nobody will love him and how he's so disgusting and full of regret. Bubbles gets pissy that he didn't turn out how she wanted. Donny is still hopeless. Something happens to turn him back into a horse. ""Well this sucks but I guess I have to appreciate who I am."" Some unicorns show up and push Donny's hair aside to reveal that HEY! HE WAS A UNICORN ALL ALONG!

Also notable is that there are a lot of references to pickles in the episode. The procedure sequence briefly pans to a shot of a pickle being smashed. Take that as you will.

I kind of want to believe it's an allegory for trans people and that the writer is the one trying to cover their ass.

Now that I've seen the cruel person behind the mask it has me questioning how I could be such a bad judge of character. Are most people this fake and if given the opportunity to hurt others who aren't actively serving them would do so?"

"There's a movie on netflix called the diabolical. It starts off pretty cool, a family being haunted. Single mom, son and daughter. Mom has a scientist boyfriend. Dad is referred to as gone in very ambiguous terms. Son has some anger issues and has been dealing with a social worker. The mysterious entity is tall, bald, and hangs out around the daughter a lot. When they try to leave the entity grabs the kids, making it so they can't leave without getting very sick. Can you guess where this is going based on this information.

If you guessed that the dad is haubting the house and protecting the family, I'm afraid you're wrong.

If you guessed the son travelled back in time from forty years into the future by means of a mysterious company that's trying to buy the land the family's house is on to make a new lab after capturing him forty years earlier when he tried to get revenge on the murder of his mother which it turns out he, travelling back in time, caused, congratulations!

The Southern States would still have slavery if it wasn't for Republicans opposing the practice.  Abraham Lincoln was a Republican and the Democrats were the party of slavery, Jim Crow, and the KKK. 

In relation to the other examples (Mass incarceration and the drug war), they both illustrate what I'm talking about very well.  California can institute a terrible policy like their 3 strikes and you're incarcerated for life law, but it's contained to CA and does not inflict that same terrible policy across the entire nation.  The same would go for the war on drugs, as states invoke their rights to legalize marijuana, they thwart the corrupting nature of the Federal government imposing those rules nationwide.  "

* Our personal struggles and intricately complicated daily tasks are really all just absurd, and in the context of the universe, really don't matter. 

* Think of a task, any task that is so challenging that it forces you to stop thinking in order to complete it. For me that was hiking. And at the top of the mountain I could finally, on a physical and mental level, feel how truly small I was.

But let's say we're not talking about a patient who has googled ""back pain"" or something. Let's say we're talking about a very sick patient who has legitimate reasons to believe they have a certain condition including, for example, positive test results and a family history. 

And let's say the condition is well-researched, and well understood by some doctors, but you as a doctor know nothing about it and think it's pretty unlikely. 

In *those* circumstances, are you likely to look into it further to fill in the gaps in your knowledge? 

Knowing that doctors see a lot of patients who do come in with printouts from WebMD, or think they have cancer because they're experiencing headaches, how does a patient reasonably broach a potential diagnosis with a doctor in a way that won't be instantly dismissed?"

"He's talking about dark energy. 
  
The universe expands because, in very basic terms, new space is being created everywhere equally. The speed of this new space creation is constantly increasing. 
  
Right now it's force is not strong enough to challenge the fundamental forces, except for the very weak gravitational forces that distant clusters exert on one another. 
  
However if the rate of expansion keeps increasing at the same rate it will start to heavily effect the strength of gravity. Starting on more distant, less massive objects, but eventually reaching the point where solar systems are torn apart. 
  
Under these circumstances the universe effectively ends when dark energy reaches the strength to break all the fundamental forces and all energy dissipates into heat. "

Insurance doesn't pay a discount. Insurance has a pre-negotiated set of rates. If the hospital charges $20 for some ibuprofen, insurance will pay $1. If the hospital charges $20000 for some ibuprofen, insurance will pay $1. If the hospital charges $.50 for ibuprofen, then insurance will only pay $.50.

Basically because of the negotiated rates, it doesn't matter what the hospital charges. It only needs to be higher than whatever insurance will pay (from the highest paying insurer that the hospital deals with). That's the main reason why these prices are completely arbitrary and stupidly high.

(There are other reasons, like dodging taxes and being ""nonprofit"" because you can post huge losses despite having made money.)"

"The conversion therapy thing really hurts for me. Last November, I participated in a mock government thing. One of the bills we heard was on banning conversion therapy on minors in the state. I mean, one of the bill authors was crying as they presented it. When people were arguing for/against the bill, one girl came out. (in front of a room of like 75 people!) The bill was very practical, and it wouldn't take too much to put it into effect. Still, after all that, the sheer amount of people that voted ""no"" both hurt and amazed me, somewhere around one half. Most of the people from my school voted no. The bill didn't pass."

Don't get me wrong Dawn was annoying as hell - that  scream of hers urgh - genuinely never disliked a character more than when she kicked Buffy out of the house. This is my house to you need to leave? No ya torn faced boot, you get yourself and the rest to fuck. Buffy **died** for you.

A few days ago, one of my much younger cousins contacted me in hopes of getting an art lesson.  I'm a decent artist. Decent enough to do commission work anyway but I digress. 
 My mother, who adopted me at age 13 to pretty much be her maid/verbal punching bag caught wind of this and tried everything in her power to dissuade my cousin from learning from me. She started by saying I was sick, I'm not. I've no clue where she got that but I bet she meant sick in the head. When that didn't make my cousin drop me, she went on to say that there are much better artists in the family to learn from (there aren't) and that if she does go through with learning from me to not listen to a word I say in regards to life especially. My cousin was good enough to tell me all of this craziness. 
Now, you're probably wondering what I've done to make my supposed Mom hate me so much. The answer is nothing. She just loves making me feel worthless and always has. I let her adopt me because my options were to keep going through the rocky foster care system and be separated from my sister, or, stay with her and my adoptive dad and be emotionally abused for the next five years. 
Some of the most extreme examples of her abuse are, reading my journals out loud to a room full of people while I sat there in obedient silence. Then there was the time I had back surgery, got an anesthesia rash and she convinced me I had herpes. I was a virgin at the time but she wasn't having any of it, said she knew I was sleeping around and, ever so shockingly told the whole family about my ""whore"" disease. She also said that I should give up on anyone ever loving me due to said disease. Which I don't have...
What she said the other day is only so devastating to me because I thought I had escaped from her nastiness. I've been moved out for four years so when that came up and slapped me in the face it just...hit really hard. "
"I don't think that being alone is unsettling. That's the base case hypothesis for me right now until proof of the contrary (even if it's unlikely, I concede).

Am I being a pragmatic, or an objectivist or whatever this school of thought is called?"

In the saga, he orders his men to carry him towards the terrible beast; he then blinds it by firing two arrows from a longbow as large as a tree trunk, which he drew back 'as if it were only a weak elm twig'.""*

Now life is so bleak for both of us, that I can't imagine what a joyous, normal and peaceful family life even is anymore. And that's all I ever craved. So be SURE of it all when you say I do. Look at her family. Look at her track record (my ex had already ruined another husband and two other sons' lives). Don't let the sex fool you.

I gathered my mates and made up stories for them and they loved it. Well, real life changed my course and I ended up as an architect. I'm 34 now, but I decided to let go of everything and do what I wanted to do. Right now I'm working on getting my masters in Literature and writing an epic fantasy. 

Of course it might not get me anywhere but I'm going to give it my best for the rest of my life. "
"&gt; Beyond that, it's rare that a conquering nation would even give concessions to a conquered people. The rule of war back then was generally something to the effect of assimilate or die. 

That is the biggest crock of shit. Historical revisionism.

I know this because my European ancestors, a tiny ethnic group, right in the middle of Europe, survived being in the middle of pretty much every European war for 1000 years, with their land being claimed and reclaimed by different countries and monarchs.

Nobody was much interested in wiping out commoners, that was the tax base, and a source of future soldiers. That's why my family finally did leave Europe: the powers that be wanted to change their language and religion. This was just after the American Revolution. At the end of the French Revolution.

In fact, that is pretty much the history of the Germanic states prior to unification in 1871. A bunch of petty princes taxing the hell out of the peasants so they could build castles beyond their means, and then attacking each other to capture more tax base.

In terms of earlier chivalry, it was considered advantageous to accept the surrender of your enemies. A living noble could be ransomed, unlike a dead one. There are plenty of examples from English History of nobles living with their captors for extended periods of time, and even a few examples of them *leaving to collect their own ransom*. And coming back.

The last thing anyone wanted to do was start a trend of mass execution. It's quite likely the favour would be returned. And peasants and townsfolk were important resources. 

It was only later(and increasingly) that *lebensraum* type ideas became more common, with asymmetrical war, like the Indian Wars in the early USA. If at all possible, groups of people were not wiped out. That's why groups like the Mongol horde are notable and feared: they did this routinely."

There is this feeling I used to have when I was depressed that I call 'being in a wet tent'.  Imagine camping in a canvas tent and it rains.  Everything is wet outside and the walls of the canvas tent are wet too.  And if you come into the tent from outside then you track in water and there isn't a place to stand in your tent that isn't where you need to slept or store your dry stuff.  Your sleeping bag is damp as well because it absorbs the humidity.  You can't stay dry and you can't get dry.  There is no comfortable spot anywhere.  Now imagine feeling like that all the time no matter where you are.

"This is not advice! You lie about it, you'll get caught. I love the fact that some companies allow you to fire people for stuff like this.

His first day was by himself in the department he had ""vast"" knowledge. He was promptly let go because of this.

I'm not saying fibbing to look more desirable isn't a bad idea, it is, but that's not the point. Don't lie when it comes to applying for a job, the company may train you, you may have lied so well you dug a hole you never knew of. Then you have a burnt bridge "

I never lived on a Rez but I have been to them and some are well off and some aren't. My family is from Pine Ridge but my immediate family has moved states and stay in the city/ suburbs.  I know a lot of people from different reservations because of boarding school. I see that a lot of their family and friends commit suicide and it's sad. A lot of my friends feel like they can never get off the Rez and think they won't be able to do anything in life. I have been to Pine ridge and it's pretty bad and I wouldn't like to live there. But I have seen some really well off reservations and still there are big drug problems.

"I was only 12 and I crept down stairs when my mom had finished washing her power drill bits. It was Christmas Eve and the computer was looking so aroused. So I said to Daphne, ""Daphne"", to which she replied ""What?"", it was a very intense encounter. Anyway I first discovered Reddit when I needed a new skin for my onion so I hopped on to the World Wide Web and low and behold a picture of a naked man came up. After a few hours of analysing and drawing the man, I decided to get a cup of tea, it was at this stage that I realised I was actually tripping on LSD. Fortunately Gerald the fish came and took me swimming in what looked very similar to my car. Reddit is a good resource for sandwiches."

"It's basically NPR in a surreal horror world. The format is basically a new cast from Nightvale Public Radio, and treats all of the *really* weird shit around town as being completely normalized.

For example, there's a dog park in Night vale. Dogs aren't allowed in the dog park. People aren't allowed in the dog park. You're not allowed to look at the dog park. Ignore the hooded figures inside the dog park. Don't think about the dog park.

Also, it's illegal to believe in angels. Despite a large contingent of them (all named Erika) living in town. So despite them definitely being angels, since it's illegal to believe in them, they are very definitely *not* angels.

A recurring character is also The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives In Your Home. No one treats her as odd.

And things like that. Reporting on the surreal, bizarre, and sometimes Lovecraftian and just treating it as day to day reporting.

There's also the weather report, which is some indie music song they change up every week. Depending on your tastes you might like some or not like some, but it's good exposure to a lot of different types of music."

"I grew up in a couple small villages in western Alaska. We don't really have reservations but they're so isolated they might as well be. From what I've learned talking to my cousins from the south (actual Rez peoples) it's all pretty much the same, except for the climate and specific culture nuances. 

It's very dark and depressing in the village. Nobody really strays that far from them once they've finished high school, IF they managed to finish that. Half the town is drunk and the other half is very conservative. 

Having read a few responses I guess the thing that sticks out the most is how difficult it was growing up as a gay eskimo. Small town where everyone is in everyone else's business. Can't really let anyone know because of how homophobic it can be, especially my peers. Its a hunting and fishing community so it's very masculine and being gay is absolutely unacceptable. 

I never really got to express my sexuality until after I moved out of the village to a city when I was 21, and even then it was a rough transition. My personality was raised in a village and it took years to break out of suppressed habits. 

I now live in the ""lower 48"" with my bf of 5 years and I've finally adapted to living ""outside"".

I do miss home though. As depressing as it was it's still my home and it's still beautiful land. Nothing will change that "
"Selling things would be such a hassle though. If I were that rich and wanted to update my decor every few years I don't think I'd bother trying to sell all of the most expensive items (expensive by rich person standards that is, to us that would be *everything*) But I'm too waste-conscious to just throw something out if it's in good condition whether it be a functional desk lamp worth $20 or a chandelier worth $20'000. So I'd probably just donate stuff I didn't want anymore and couldn't be arsed to try and sell. Get the charity people to come and pick it up (they'll probably just sell it and have themselves a nice payday, but eh, what do I care, I'd be wealthy enough to have more important shit to worry about) And as long as nothing ends up in the dump before it goes through at least one other owner then my conscience is clear :)"

"I am a western coastal native. I grew up my entire life down in the Hoh river reservation, I'm halfbreed native Quileute, mixed with Haida'gwii. I live a decent but unstable childhood in almost a ""peaceful"" but isolated environment. many people used to earned their income through salmon and steelhead fishing but it doesn't come as easily as it did several years ago when there were more fish in the waters. 
I would used to always go to many dinners and pot'laches for drumming,singing and dancing, whether it be a name giving for someone or blessing a canoe. These days the culture has really seemed to die out to the point where it's almost rare for what used to be an occasion. I hope the next generation carries on the traditions and teachings. 
I really love and dislike it at the same time I had to grow up in such a small isolated area, mostly because of how beautiful of an area it is in the pacific northwest. It can be really creepy at times though especially during nighttime walking around the rez while it's pitchblack out. I've came across a teenage cougar once while walking out on a trail in the woods. 
It can be pretty hard growing up in reservations at times for some people due to so many people being poor at times and not having any real opportunity's while stuck in a place where they can't go out in learn very many lifeskills. I myself have gotten my high school diploma out of the way but am currently struggling to even get a car right now and the money to move out of the reservation.
I really do appreciate the fact I got to be born in to so much culture though, and wish to carry that on if I can in the future."

"Another thing you have to realize is that many of us ""whites"" have grandparents that were full blooded Indians.  Our grandparents often married whites and so as we descended we are now considered white.  This is the case for SO MANY people I know.

For instance, my great grandfather's mother was a full blooded Choctaw Indian.  She met my great great grandfather as he was passing through Oklahoma.  She became pregnant as he moved towards the west in the great expansion of the frontier.  If you meet me I have green eyes, dark hair and I attribute the color of my skin ( which is an Anglo warm very light brown) to my Indian side.

Indians have been absorbed into the fabric of our country.  So the legacy of the Indians remain, although somewhat unacknowledged because once our grandparents intermarried their descants became white---

"Thank you for considering whether or not this is an offensive question, I really appreciate it. I think that a lot of what needs to happen in order to help our people has to come from the tribes themselves.

"Yeah, lots of people don't seem to understand that feral dog packs are basically wolves. I had the same experience in rural South-East Asia (mainly Cambodia, but other places too), where poor villagers just cut their dogs loose and stop caring about them. In some places they just became wild animals again, and you now have packs of 10-20 starving dogs roaming the countryside, randomly attacking people. Every now and then they butcher a kid, and the local police or even the army has to move in and shoot dogs on sight. 

I used to like dogs, but after getting surrounded a couple of times by half a dozen feral dogs, they scare me shitless. "

"American here: I like 8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown, and Mock the Week is great too. But, there was an American comedian on Cats does Countdown who was asked if a show like that could work in the US and he said no. The reason? It's actually too smart for a fair chunk of the US audience. There would be enough people who would go ""what the fuck?"" and immediately switch to another channel. Now, these are his words and not mine, but frankly, I agree with him. I think that a lot of people would be turned off by that show unfortunately, even though it is radically different from the type of panels we see on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and from our current late night fair of news satire (of which there is slightly too much, IMO). Though, I'd love to see Mock the Week get a shot in the US. "

She felt much better after that, first time in a month, when none of the doctors would say anything optimistic.
Wierd things is, when my grandmother heard i was donating, she freaked out and said ""let the other guys  donate, not you!"". There are no ""other guys"". Everyone is someone's loved one. And most people i talk to are afraid of needles, or have conditions, or just selfish and too lazy.

Drink a lot of water beforehand, get a good night's sleep, and do not think much of it. Talk to people who donated at that place to hear the good experiences. Take someone with you to talk while you donate. It is fine. We are wired to lose some blood from time to time from when people roamed forests barefoot."

"We have a friend that we used to hangout with when we were in highschool. The four of use were like brothers. If one get into a mess, the other three will follow. We always cover each other's back and stick to each other through better and worst. But it all change when one of us started taking meth. When we were highschool students, two from our group used to smoke marijuana (which for me is fine) then as time goes by, the other guy stopped but the other one switched from weed to meth. We kept telling him to avoid it as he is already a family man and his kids are still very young. He never listens to us and even influenced one of our friends to use drugs as well. From a user, he became a dealer. Even though he distanced himself to us, we never fail to advise him whenever we have a chance. I even invited the two of them to come work abroad so they can put and end to their addiction. Our friend whom he influenced with drugs end up in jail for selling drugs for him. He didn't even bother helping our friend in any way possible. May it be a few clothes or food, he never cared. We started feeling bad about him for what he is doing. 

One of my friend even said that ""We cant do anything. Our words just fell on deaf ears. We'll just attend his funeral someday"" because he's already on the drug watch list and probably might end up dead. "

When I was about 13 or 14 years old, I was helping my dad coach a Special Olympics softball team at the Missouri state games (my older sister was on the team). We were staying at a hotel that was filled with other Special Olympics athletes. One evening during the tournament, there was a big pool party for the athletes at the hotel pool. There were only a couple lifeguards (probably college-aged) on duty, and the pool was way over-crowded.

One of the athletes had a seizure in the pool, and sank to the bottom. Nobody, including the lifeguards, saw it happen. Another athlete, a young man with Down Syndrome, was swimming under the water and saw the girl on the bottom of the pool. He pulled her to the side and screamed to the nearest lifeguard for help. The lifeguard pulled the girl out of the water, scraping the hell out of her face on the side of the pool. The lifeguard then completely froze, maybe because of the blood covering the girl's face, and stood there just staring at her. Another coach and I ran over, found that the girl was not breathing, and began performing CPR. After what was probably only a few moments (though it felt like an eternity), she starting vomiting water and breathing again. 

I only played a small role in the incident, as the athlete who found the girl and pulled her to the side of the pool was the hero. Still, the whole event was something I'll definitely never forget."

"I grew up near the ""reservation"" for most of my life and it was about a 2 hour drive to see family out there, but for about 3-4 years I lived at least 6 hours away from them, so I would get to visit both sides of my family growing up (parents were separated, never married), and it was fine because those were the early years before both sides of my family started drifting apart from each other after the deaths of my great-grandparents. Plus it was odd for me whenever people asked about my mom's age because she had me in high school which is a common thing to this day out there.

During my early adolescent and teenage years I lived on the ""reservation"" and I can't remember much from those earlier years, but during my teenage years it was wildly different going from a predominantly ""white"" school to a ""Rez"" school, because the education systems were so different, but the tribal school system definitely falls behind in academics (possibly due to the kids not wanting to learn I suspect). Also, when I moved back to start in 6th grade I was placed with the 8th graders for the first 2 weeks while the school evaluated a test I took then eventually I got placed in my proper grade level. Now I didn't grow up speaking my tribes language, and in my first year at this school I was placed in a tribe language class, and had a difficult time speaking the language, due to it being my first time actually using more words outside of home. I spent about 5 years out there due to family complications between my mother and step-dad, as I was about to enter 6th grade at this school in Vegas. That was my experience in education growing up beyond the borders of my tribe and moving back and learning there.

When it came to seeing family as time progressed I noticed a lot of the little things about their dialects they use, and pretty much what they know when it comes to anything. I got lucky because my mom wanted the best for my brother, and that's why we lived off the ""Rez"" so we wouldn't end up like all the other children who live there (now some I know from back in middle school and high school did go to university and are doing well), but I think that really was just the environment the grew up in. My family is happy with how I turned out:

* no children
* single
* not addicted
* going to university
* having a job

I grew up in a cultural family so there are a lot of things that I'm suppose to follow otherwise ""bad"" things could happen to me. I wasn't strictly raised though through ""Native American Church"" until I started becoming an adult, so I developed my own thoughts on many things that I kind of see as unnecessary, but do them so that I don't upset my mother (although now I have started having an open mind to a lot of it because of where I am in life now). It's always been interesting answering the questions my friends ask me though about my cultural identity, so I indulge them and tell them how it is, or sometimes I introduce them to family.

This was all I could really think up of while typing this, I kind of trailed off in some areas I think, but if want to know more I'll answer them when I can. Right now though in life I moved away from my tribes sacred area, at least a 2 day drive away from home now, and it was difficult at first (still is but not as hard) due to never living away from family for longer than a week. Right now I am growing my hair out, and working on my personal health as well as working to maintain my cultural identity since I'm far from home now."

One night him and his buddy were hanging outside a restaurant after a couple of drinks, when a group of 4 guys walked up to them and started talking a lot of shit, and challenging them to a fight. My dad  thought to himself ""these guys dont look too tough I think WE can take them"". My dad's buddy threw the first punch at one of the guys, and my dad was immediately grabbed by multiple angles and got the shit kicked out of him. After about 30 seconds of getting absolutely destroyed the fight gets broken up. He picks himself up off the ground and is looking for his buddy. He's nowhere to be found. He asked someone who saw the whole thing what happened. The guy said after his friend threw the punch he basically high tailed it out of there, leaving my dad.

"This one hit a chord. I had a college professor whom I thought of as my mentor. He used to hang out with his students all the time, even having parties at his house where people would go hot-tubbing. I never did any of the hot tubbing but I went to one of the parties with my boyfriend. I mostly interacted with the professor in class.

Then one day, when I was just about to graduate I was talking to my professor in his office. He opened his desk drawer and pulled out a card with his phone number on it. He then told me that he was a photographer and would like to take my picture sometime. I was only about 24 at the time, but maybe I should have known that this was suspicious.

Fast forward to a few weeks after graduation. The professor asked me to have lunch with him. We went out to a restaurant then back to his place. He had recently split up with his wife, so no one was there. He asked me if I wanted to see some of his photography. I naively said yes. 

So he pulls out about 10 huge photo albums and in every single one of them are naked pictures of women. He tells me all these women are his former students. I was pretty shocked and told him that I wasn't going to take those kind of pictures. He proceeded to argue with me about the value of the photos so I left. 

The worst thing for me was not the shock of his disgusting hobby. It was the fact that I thought of him as a mentor and my value of myself as a student was partly based on his praise and encouragement. Shortly thereafter, I was turned down by every graduate school to which I applied. It turns out I was a bit overconfident in choosing schools. It made me wonder if all that praise and attention was legit. Probably not. "

So they had a wedding and he set her up in a business while he went back to adventuring. 

A neighboring wizard gave him a ring of conjugal visits as a wedding present: it teleported him to his wife for one hour, then sent him back. Limited uses. The guy put it to the obvious use at first, then started hitting up the priest at the village temple for healing potions. After he woke the priest at three in the morning to buy potions I had the priest lose his temper at the guy and refuse to do business.

After that he had to return to the usual newlywed stuff with his bride."

I've tried to be strong for my kids 21,17,8 but its been so hard. When he left my step sons stopped talking to me, one of them lived with us for over 2 years. 
 I've thought of suicide but then I think of my youngest. My family doesn't really talk to me. I'm too depressed for them. And my family wants me to be mad, I'm too hurt to be mad. 
 I think all the time how things would be better for my kids if I wasn't around. ( my 2 oldest help support me since my husband left. I have had major back problems and through my whole marriage we agreed I'd be a stay at home mom.) My husband struggles paying for part of my living and his own living. If I was gone my oldest kids would have plenty of money from their jobs to take care of them selves. And my husband would care for my youngest. She's always been a daddy's girl anyway.  
I'm lost, broken, and alone.

Shortly after he left us and told the kids he would always be just a phone call away he moved to California. Two states away. He's not a phone call away and my kids blame me. 
We never really fought through out our marriage. Hell we were the couple everyone wanted. 
Now he's gone, I don't even know how to picture a future without him.

"I was 16ish in my basement watching Saw III with my mom, right at the beginning where Kerry is in the unwinnable trap. Right when she was digging in the acid jar to get the key we heard the door absolutely SLAM open upstairs which was odd because my dad was in another state at the time. 

The movie was pretty loud because I like to listen to movies loud but we could still hear stomping feet very obviously, as in multiple people going around the living room. So obviously we got the fuck out of the basement through the door in the back leading outside. 

The lights at the doorway were on, and maybe a minute or slightly more after we ran out and hid in the bushes and started dialing 911 we saw at least 4 or 5 shadows of people run out through the same door illuminated by those lights and disappeared into the woods. They left the door open because our dogs ended up outside.

The cops came and checked everything. The people had forced the front lock open with something really crude like a crowbar, I dunno, because it was scratched all to hell. They hadn't taken a single thing. The only thing they did was come inside, into the living room, and then follow the sound to try to find where the people were.

I don't know what they wanted to do with us. But they went straight for the sound of the TV so they were there to find people, not our valuables, of which we had a LOT out in the open. They were there for *us*."

"FWIW, the first season of Parks and Recreation was by far the weakest of the series. The characters were fairly one-dimensional, and the show was finding its feet. Like you, I watched a few episodes of the first season when it came out, and it really didn't do anything for me. A few years later, I gave it another try, and by the time I was a few episodes into season 2, I was hooked. It is one of the rare sitcoms that actually improved significantly as it went on, rather than becoming stale. I went from not liking it to having it be easily one of my favorite 5 shows of all-time."

"**Sex**

It is an undeniable fact that if you are born with a dick, you are a male. If you are born with a vagina, you are a female. No amount of social justice or reconstructive surgery will change that and you certainly cannot change that by identifying as a different gender. So when people get all up in arms that they aren't ""accepted"" for what they identify as, it just comes across as bitching.

&amp;nbsp;

**Sexual Orientation**

On the other hand, sexual orientation is something that is highly subjective and cannot be refuted. I can't tell a male who is attracted to males that he's wrong and that he's actually attracted to females... it just wouldn't be true and how would I even be able to prove it? So in that sense, I think sexual orientation is something that should be respected be everyone. Whether you're straight/bi/homosexual... no one can tell you you're wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit:

I stand corrected, as what I described at the top was sex as it applied to biological characteristics and is different from gender, which is a mental identity. So this comment doesn't really appropriately answer the question."

I didn't even showcase the way that I am thinking, I never manifested/presented an hypothesis on what causes it(mainly because it's not a topic that interests me that much, so I just won't go there and make an assumption). 

But yeah, I just pointed that the issue originates from the brain. What causes it, I don't know. 

It's akin to saying artifacting is caused by a problem in your GPU. I don't know what exactly in the GPU causes artifacting, neither did I mention/make an assumption about it, so bringing forward what causes the problem *in the GPU* doesn't invalidate in any way the claim that it is a GPU problem.

"That's a little similar to a point I'll bring up when discussing sexual orientation with others.  It's something an old friend told me in college.  I can't imagine *not truly being able to be yourself* around family &amp; friends, not being able to vocalize or act out your desires or attraction towards others.  Life can be tough enough as it is, but then having to hold back a huge part of your life has to be really tough.  Add to it dangers you mentioned, etc.  I know it's repetitive, but damn...

"That being LGBT is much more than ""who you like,"" ""who you sleep with,"" or what ""genitalia you're into."" 

In a lot of ways, we encounter the world in a fundamentally different way than straight people do. And for all we have in common, we also have experiences you'll never have, and you have ones we'll never have. 

At least for me, I engage in a constant process of judging how ""gay I'm coming off,"" depending on the company of the people around me. That process, while a part of my daily life, is not, I think, necessarily something a straight person can immediately understand.

Battery is a worse charge than assault.

Splooging on someone, is battery.  If what you are saying is correct, it would be battery with a biological agent."

There is a small field there a little ways off the road connecting to a swamp with a large circular grove of trees thereabouts in the middle of the field. This is where the bombs still are buried to this day. It is much safer for them to be left there in the ground than to risk exhuming them. 

That grove of trees has a eerie feeling being around it. I always feel some fear while also being thankful at the same time when I come around the area. "
"I hate equating car deaths to gun deaths, the primary use of a car is not to murder someone.

You can't just be like ""in the future we're not going to give guns out to just anybody"" because these people already have them. Until people themselves take responsibility for it then there can't be change.

So I spoke about it with my doctor who prescribed me medication that helped to an extent, but it wasn't until I entered therapy that I started to feel like myself again. I no longer take medication to treat my depression because I did not care for the side-effects, but I do continue therapy and have for over a decade now.

My dad's sister basically killed my grandma (her mom), and no one did anything.

Grandma suffered from dementia during her final years and got progressively worse. My aunt was already living with my grandparents and turned her house into a pig stye with her 10 kids and dead beat baby daddy living there in squalor. As grandma got worse, she began to wander and leave the house. Since my aunt was caring for her million kids she started to lock my grandma in her room so she wouldn't go anywhere. 

Aunt basically used grandma for her money, made my grandma sign all rights to my aunt financial wise and used her money for meth. Our family tried to get my grandma into a home but my aunt refused and got mad. Apparently everyone was afraid of her. 

When grandma died, my aunt was the ""biggest mourner"" crying around. Meanwhile, she basically got away with everything. Now she's the ""born again Christian"" on Facebook, talking about morals and being a ""family"". 

While no one bothers to talk about it, I feel my aunt will get her due justice. "

I'm not exactly a Giants fan but between spite and my normal inclination to root for the underdog, I had a lot of fun arguing with/taunting Becca through 3 quarters of the Super Bowl. I was a huge asshole the entire time because who the fuck expects an undefeated team to lose to Eli Manning? I was so sure that the Pats would win that I held absolutely nothing back. The 4th quarter rolls around and it's closer than I expected so I started trying to be less of a dick. I stopped taunting her but kept on BS-ing about the game and doing normal Super Bowl cross-chatter. Then Eli slipped that sack and Tyree had the helmet catch and I immediately knew that they were going to win that game. I went silent and she was staring daggers at me. When the Giants went ahead Becca burst into tears and started full on screaming at me.

"Given the size of the Universe and distance between planets, I don't think it's unusual that we haven't found anything yet. Given that it would take, at minimum, 100 years or so for humans to travel to even the closest habitable planet, and that we've only had the technology to get off the surface of our planet for about that same amount of time, and that humans will probably die off in another 1,000 years or so, it seems probable that, even if there is other life on other planets, that it may very well have existed long before humans, never had the technology to travel off their own planet, or may be enroute to Earth but won't reach us for another 500 Earth years or so.

tl;dr: Space is huge. Like, really, really huge. Civilizations are small and short-lived in comparison."

"I really dislike golden retrievers. I grew up in a suburb with a ton of neurotic goldens, and they all were such a pain in the ass. 

The thing is, it's more like deep pity. These dogs (I'm assuming) were bred to actually *do* something, and instead they sit around on the couch and go ape when someone comes home, but they always get ignored or pushed away for being so hyper.

So maybe I just hate people who own goldens. "
"I think it is extremely beneficial for a child to have a YouTube channel early on in life.

Gaming commentary and constantly being able to think on your toes with what to say is *so* helpful in the real world.  (Interviews)

Our community of 300ish subscribers have been able to build his confidence with their constructive criticism and kind words.  I always try to read every comment to him so he knows what people like/dislike.  (Obviously ignoring the troll comments)

Getting to share a hobby with your dad is something not many kids in the world get to do at all, let alone have their dad in their life at all.  I hope that with our channel we encourage at least 1 dad to get more involved with their kid's life and just act silly and not care.  These memories are timeless and when I am 70 years old looking back at these videos I guarantee I cry like a baby."

I'm not going to argue about the merits of a popular vote vs an electoral college but calling the people who voted for Trump ""the majority"" is just factually inaccurate. Trump won with a plurality in the GOP primary (44.9%) and didn't even manage that in the general election.

Donald Trump is most definitely still the legitimate POTUS but he did not win a majority at pretty much any point of his campaign."

"On a related note, I had read somewhere that this is kind of why we have (common) Déjà vu. Frontal and temporal communication gets screwed up. Your brain interprets a situation you are experiencing much slower than you are storing the experience. Therefore, it isn't that it has happened before, but that your brain (temporal lobe) already computed what happened and stored it, before your frontal lobe could have access to the long term memory area. So, your frontal lobe sees that this memory is already stored, because it reacted much slower than the temporal lobe, and thus thinks this situation already happened.

I cannot find the source, it may have been reddit? lol I liked the explanation, though, it made a lot of sense.

TL;DR: Déjà vu happens because your brain stores the memory of what's happening before you consciously know what's happening."

Literally just the thought of endless great food is enough to make me want to live forever.  I don't get tired of my favorite books or movies if I wait a while in between reading/watching.  There's so much to re-experience, much less discover.

"It's depend on what kind of person you are drinking with , but here a couple suggestions ;

Online ;  Open-world Sandbox games are really fun when you are too drunk to complete a mission. GTA-5 with friends is a blast. The new races are really fun and there some adversary mode awesome to play with friends. I would suggest playing on a private server to avoid 13 years old kids ruining the mood. 
This is seriously my favorite game to chill with friends of any types of skills and you can get GTA for like 20-25$ on the net.

Space Engineer(PC)

Mess around in Sand box mode with big ass giant ship or do a Battle royale between you and your friends. My favorite late night game is basically everyone building a ship and facing each other in the middle.... the creativity of drunkness never cease to amaze me. 



If you want to play with your friends while at home and you dont have 2 pc , try those games. They are basically Local co-op supported.  (Plug a xbox 360 or Xbox 1 controller into the pc and you are gtg)


Broforce ; Contra fueled by American Freedom.
Gang Beasts ; da best fighting game.

It was always only one family member, and it changed every time I had the dream.

Also the first time I had a lucid dream. The world was ending and asteroids were about to destroy earth. In my fear, I had the realization that it didn't have to end that way, and I used my ""magical powers"" to deflect the asteroids and save everyone.

Also shortly before I graduated with my first college degree, I had a dream where I was standing on a frozen lake and was face to face with a lion. I knew I could never fight a lion with only my hands, so I feared the horrible death I was about to experience.

As the lion approached and was ready to lunge at me, the ice broke beneath its weight and it fell through.

That dream with the lion always seemed symbolic to me.

Still sad, depressed, and angry. All I can think about is I'll never get to see or talk to him again. Our entire lives we never lived more than 15 minutes away from each other. We were supposed to  grow old and watch our kids grow up and be best friends together too. Now it'll just be me by myself growing old with my family. We did everything together and now it's just me.

She doesn't have the strength to move furniture, I do. We are complementary and that is better than being the same. We have different roles, and if you want to think of it as sexist and unequal, than we most definitely see things differently. We are both happy and I hope the same for you :)"

20 plus years of living on my own I can say

Routines - very important.

Make sure you have a schedule for getting things completed. 

Keep your bathroom clean, you never know when you might have company or want to invite someone over. 

Clean your dishes right after using them. Clean what you prepared your meals with before you eat. Don't let things soak.

Keep a tidy place. You don't have to be overly anal, but neat. Make your bed after you get out of it first thing in the morning. Wash your sheets and pillow cases every other laundry day. Keep spare sheets.  

Sometimes it might be comforting to leave radio on low volume when you sleep.

Don't over buy food, kitchen utensils, dishes, silverware only get what you need. Two stories, 1. My family kept buying me sets of 4 dishware. I was single and very rarely had people over all it did was make me lazy to do dishes. 2. One of my friends bought a 24 glass set when he first moved out, lived by himself. Had dirty glasses all the time. If you only have 1 or 2 you will keep them clean.

You also might have to invest in things you never knew you needed. Vacuum Cleaner, Broom, Mop, Bucket, Cleaning supplies, air filters, water filter, trash cans, trash bags, lighting, light bulbs, candles, coasters, first aid supplies, shower curtain and liner, Clothes hangers, curtains. I hung blankets over my windows first time I moved out.

You don't have to get all of those things at once but will be convenient to have. Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, Liquidation centers good place to get essentials cheap.

I have lived in different types of places. Mobile homes, condos, apartments, and have even rented just a room and you have to remember you are responsible for yourself no matter what, unless you get a crazy stalker willing to do things for you, which can happen, but most of the time you got to wash your own ass."
"&gt; Sure, she’s laughing at my jokes but I’m hilarious.

"I went through the thousand plus comments to concur with someone else, but no one gave me that option. Are we really going to skip RAVENSWOOD??? How is this not universally accepted as the worst show ever? As if Pretty Little Liars is terrible enough, Ravenswood is a spin-off. Hannah's boyfriend, Kaleb leaves Rosewood to live in Ravenswood where there are actual ghosts, et cetera. It lasted only one season due to how awful the premise was and, probably, due to how unnecessarily scary it was for a channel called ABC Family. Lol. Because it got canceled, the producers brought Kaleb back to Pretty Little Liars to just act like he didn't spend ten episodes seeing actual ghosts. "
"About 5 years ago, my ex girlfriend's insanely religious sister converted her to Christianity through fear. She developed an unhealthy level of fear of going to hell. It was a very difficult when she stopped having sex with me because of ""no sex before marriage"". Whenever she would slip up and we'd have sex, it would become a serious issue for her and she would get very emotional. Fast forward a few months later on Valentine's day. We went on a date and it went well until we got back to my house. She gave me an ultimatum. Become Christian or she'd break up with me. I had a meltdown because I loved her and it was heart crushing. I caved in and said yes. I was honest with her too by telling her that I was going to have to fake belief until I actually did. The whole ordeal fucked me up big time. I dated her for another year while pretending that I believed in God. It screwed up my psyche and I constantly had to suspend my actual agnostic beliefs every day. I actually started having psychotic episodes from time to time. I was hospitalized once and paramedics were called too another time. She broke up with me after the last psychotic episode I ever had. She held my hand in an effort to calm me down and I ended up squeezing it really hard without realizing it. I felt like a monster even though it was unintentional. Yes, I regret my decision of converting to Christianity to try and save a relationship. It might be the worst decision I've ever made. I don't resent her for it. If anything, her sister was the person that caused it. I don't resent her either because she is nuts. She seems like her mental health is deteriorating. I got a phone call from her a few months ago out of the blue where she was having hallucinations. She was crying and saying that she's in hell."
"Worst.. honestly the worst was when we thought my mom had cancer 11 years ago. Not any fault of her own obviously, just my worst memory involving my mom. They told her it was stage 4 and we were all distraught over it thinking we would lose her. In the end it turned out she had a benign 7lb tumor and it was so large it pressed on her lymph nodes which made them look like it was more advanced stage. Biggest miracle when the surgeon came out and told us she didn't have cancer. But yes, that whole time was awful and scary.  Just thinking about it makes me feel sick. She got hurt a few weeks ago and has been in the hospital and it brought all of that back, it's an awful feeling to think you might lose your parent. 

Best .. it sounds silly but it's the little things from growing up. My mom was in a wheelchair so there's a lot she couldn't do with us, but little things like she'd sit and color with us or play with play doh. Or we had a tradition for years that at least one Saturday a month we went to the movies, shopping, and dinner, just me and my mom and sister. Those memories are the best of my childhood.

"If you don't have a job, this is your job. Pick a time to start and a time to stop each day. Be tenacious and don't stop when you run out of options on monster.com - contact recruiters in your area and in your field and proactively give them your resume, ask to sit down and discuss what options they have and what you're interested in. Look up companies in your field in your area, or areas you're willing to relocate to and browse their careers pages. Call people. Walk into businesses. Dress for the job you want every day. Be detailed on your resume but concise, be sure to outline all of your strengths, not just your certifications. 

And don't be disheartened when this doesn't pan out in a week, or even a month, just keep at it. Tenacity and initiative go a long way."

"I e-mailed a girl when I was in 7th grade and told her I had a crush on her. She was attractive, popular, funny and was also a cheerleader. You know, basically like every boy's dream girl. I was the kid who was labeled as a loser and I also talked with a lisp so honestly, I didn't really have a chance, but you know how that goes.

We were friends, because we had some classes together, but that was about it. Like I said, one day, my 7th grade boy hormones got the best of me and I decided to send her an e-mail and express my feelings to her and how much I liked her. Much to my surprise, she did e-mail me back, and say we were just friends. I was disappointed and instantly regretted it.

From there on, I didn't go for any girls that were blatantly out my league. I guess it's pretty tough to fuck something up that I would have honestly had no chance of getting in the first place."

Though, with my fiance being autistic and my having adhd, we went into this knowing we were going to hit communication bumps and planned accordingly. In fact the only reason we had a rough patch this year was because of our roommate grating on us both so badly that we ended up taking it out on each other.

Edit:
&gt;Key findings for this update, which are consistent with previous research, including research done by the Office of the Chief Economist (OCE) are that:-In 2015, there were 9.0 million STEM workers in the United States. About 6.1 percent of all workers are in STEM occupations, up from 5.5 percent just five years earlier.-Employment in STEM occupations grew much faster than employment in non-STEM occupations over the last decade (24.4 percent versus 4.0 percent, respectively), and STEM occupations are projected to grow by 8.9 percent from 2014 to 2024, compared to 6.4 percent growth for non- STEM occupations.
&gt;-STEM workers command higher wages, earning 29 percent more than their non-STEM counterparts in 2015. This pay premium has increased since our previous report, which found a STEM wage advantage of 26 percent in 2010.-Nearly three-quarters of STEM workers have at least a college degree, compared to just over one-third of non-STEM workers.-STEM degree holders enjoy higher earnings, regardless of whether they work in STEM or non- STEM occupations. A STEM degree holder can expect an earnings premium of 12 percent over non-STEM degree holders, holding all other factors constant.

"For me personally, I don't see any reason to just be a dick to somebody for no reason. And yeah I was the ""nice guy"" and ""King Friendzone"" in high school. I've just always put others before myself because I'd rather see somebody else succeed and know that I helped in that success, rather be succesful myself, which has taken its toll. 

I used to be a doormat back in high school because I was pretty much desperate for friends. So I'd like give my lunch to some guy instead of eating, give up my last pen because some random guy asked or give all my answers to literally any girl because maybe, just maybe, I might not be a loser any more. Didn't do jack shit, but go figure. 

I feel like my kindness has gotten me a few best friends though. So it hasn't been all doom and gloom. Although, dark days are common for me. I guess I've just decided to take the good with the bad and just deal with all this shit called life."

Turns out this was a popular kidnapping technique (putting something on a windshield) and a young woman was kidnapped that day in that parking garage when the mall closed. It freaks me out to think about if I would have left work earlier, or if I had read the note in the parking garage instead of at home.

"It's a mascara with a different formula to regular mascaras. It essentially forms little polymer tubes that constrict around your lashes as it dries instead of being a more oil/wax based coating like most. When you wash it off it doesn't smear or run, it just clumps into these little black goopy things, you just rinse it off with water as it makes the tubes loosen and release from the lashes. Because it doesn't dissolve when you wash it off, it also doesn't smudge underneath your eyes throughout the day.

"So what you do, is you get a whole bunch of ice.  You fill up the bathtub with cold water.  You pour all the ice in.  Submerge your body entirely (not head though, pls – scary scary).  It's uncomfortable, no?  No; it's *refreshing*!  Feel the weird way your breathing changes.  Your limbs tingle, your nerves firing like crazy.  Adrenaline should kick in, and you'll start to feel **alive** in a way that you haven't for a long time.  Shiver.  Embrace this.  This is happening.  Fingertips numb.  You're alive.  Teeth chattering.  Breathing quick, shallow.  Heartbeat fast, strong.  Very alive.  That adrenaline feels good.  You're uncomfortable, chilled.  Climb out of that tub, wrap put on the coziest clothes you own, wrap yourself in the thickest quilt you can find – bonus points if it is still warm from the dryer.  If you have a heater or furnace or fireplace, whatever, sit near that.  Feels good, don't it?  You can't feel that contentedness and comfort as you warm up and the adrenaline calms down if you aren't alive.

Then, go do something.  Keep yourself moving, busy, occupied, because once you stop it is so hard to start again.  Find a hobby, take up a sport, just run run run.  Run away into the woods for an hour, enjoy your own company, the even patter of your feet, the wind, the birdsong.  Do something.  Anything.  Set little goals for yourself, and build them up slowly.  You'll be fine, if you put a whole lot of work into being so."

"Years ago my boyfriend and our roommate were looking for a roommate. Having had success finding a roommate Craigslist before, we decided to go that route again. We put up an ad and got a couple of responses, one was from this girl *Janelle*. She seemed fairly nice and even sent a picture of herself.  She said he was from France but had duel citizenship. She was going to be attending a local university, but was currently doing research in Alaska  and couldn't meet us or move in until our lease was to be signed. 

That's when I started getting red flags.  I tried looking her up on Facebook, there was no trace of her on there. So I tried googling her, nothing. I finally brought it up to the bf and the roommate, they were convinced that I was just being jealous(which I can understand how they might have reached that conclusion)  and didn't want another attractive female on the house.

After a while my roommate started believing that I wasn't just being a jealous bitch, something seriously fishy was going on. My boyfriend refused to believe me, until she emailed us that she needed us to western union her some money to help her have her car delivered. He almost went through with it, until my roommate and literally told him he couldn't do that. 

We confronted her and then she magically stopped replying. It ended up leaving us with less than two weeks to find another roommate. We ended up having to go with the guy who showed up drunk to his interview, and *shockingly* turned out to be a raging alcoholic.


**tl;dr: found a roommate on Craigslist, who turned out to be a scam artist. Roommates ignored the redflags because she was attractive. I was right, but ended up settling for a drunk instead**"

"Can't speak from experience but we used to have a friend in middle school and first two years of high school, who we all knew was a compulsive liar. Dude lied about everything. After awhile it just got old and we stopped hanging out with him. The thing that really made me mad was that every time he lied, which is basically whenever he opened his mouth, it would just insult the shit out of me. How dumb do you think I am? I'm not sure what the kid is up to now or if he ever stopped. I know after we kicked him to the curb, he blamed everyone but himself. Probably an indicator he has not stopped is I randomly saw him downtown and he told me he was in college taking computer courses and then I bumped into his ex and she died laughing after I told her I randomly saw this dude and told her what he told me. Turns out, he's not in college and works at a car wash. Also, she found grindr on his phone... and apparently he's hard core into drugs.

"Isn't DAPL totally unrelated?

From what I understand the construction was run by the tribe months beforehand and they simply never got a response, so they moved the pipeline to outside those boundaries. The same pipeline went through a bunch of other tribal groups but they all came to an agreement before that point and there was never a problem there.

While this probably feeds back to local government issues discussed by other protestors, the fact is that, at least from what I was told by groups AGAINST the pipeline, there were many, MANY chances to change how things turned out that simply weren't taken."

Others say he was simply an angel.

He wasn't being completely serious but he wasn't pretending either. I'd like to note I'm not very religious and respect all sects of all Abrahamic religions. "

"Im a bit late. Im excited because i get to see caspa on the 9th. Ill be going out of town for it and someone i met on tinder there wants to meet up. I know they are literally using me for drugs but im just excited to have someone to spend time with. Currently I think I can live till the 9th. Im hoping for after new years but itll most likely be after halloween. 

Also i use to have a crush on a chick who i knew had feelings for me, maybe even loved her if I can say that. Idk havnet really been very interested in someone before. Well in the winter I finally got really drunk and just confessed to a lot of what I was feeling. But also just said I wanted to figure things out and really learn whether I have true feelings. Within 2 weeks she had a boyfriend. It hurt but it was within her rights. So to spare me the pain of watching it all on facebook I just unfriended her. She could still contact me through snapchat and messenger if needed. We really didnt talk much since then. This also gave me the time to work on my feelings. I realized I think that maybe I didnt love her, and maybe I was just trying my hardest to force myself into the thought of it because really this girl was the first person to show interest in me. She has now added me back on facebook, i later learned she broke up with her bf so thats probably why, and I thought okay maybe talking more again will respark the interest. But ive noticed that every time I get a message im no longer excited. Ill even sometimes put off even reading it. She lives 2 hours out of my city so seeing her in person is hard is a chore. But I ended up driving to a city in another province for a music festival, the kicker is that where she lives is only a little out of the way. And adding an hour to an already 8 hour drive isnt much. So i asked her if she wanted to hang out on my way back home, I could take an extra day off and we could just chill the whole day. She agrees. Well I had a fun time at the festival I actually ended up meeting the person mentioned in the first bit before this. So I text her saying im about to leave the city, note that I spent a good 8 hours site seeing before leaving, and head her way. Turns out shes in another town looking for a ride home (went to a concert or something) I say I can give her a ride home if needed but keep looking for a ride. Well im 1 hour away and I get a text saying ""I dont want to go home anymore."" because of her breakup or something. Im just in awe. I literally ask her to hangout, then she adjusts those plans so that I have to pick her up from another town, then she just cancels? I can get youre emotional about the break up and need time but couldnt she have told me while I was still in the other city? I easily could have crashed at some people i know's place or got a motel and partied for one last night instead of driving 8 hours on 3 hours of sleep just to see her. This really cemented my idea that I have definitely lost feelings for her. 

But because of this I kind of have the feeling im going to die alone. ive never dated, jesus to lose my virginity i got an escort. The only other person whose showed the slightest interest in me is the girl i met on tinder in a city 8 hours away. Who is 90% using me to get free drugs but as I said I honestly dont care at this point. Ive had to pay people in some way to show interest in me for as long as I can remember. And honestly im juts happy to have someone to do drugs with. I used to have a friend who would go to shows with me and wed get fucked up but because he moved out of town and his job is the style of 2 weeks on 2 weeks off or what ever schedules conflict. Hes basically my only friend at all and I considered him my best friend when he lived here. And I believe at one point he thought of me as one of his best friends as well. But even though hes got a new kid where I live and he comes here every time hes off im nothing but an after thought. I will see snaps of him out with his other friends while here. I mean jesus I got invited to go out once, and he forgot. But he didnt forget to ask me after they were done at the club for me to pick them up. 

idk i just edited in a lot of shit and shared probably more than i should ahve but thats just some of the stuff on my mind. "

"Two years ago. We were renting a house in town and at 2am I went outside because I heard the dog barking. Turns out there was some drunk dude in my front yard, so I asked him what he was doing there. He rambled about how he was hiding from the government and they were after him. I politely asked him to leave my property because he was upsetting my dog and I didn't want my kids to wake up, I went in the house.

About thirty seconds after I closed and locked the front door he started banging on it and shaking the door really hard like he was trying to get in. He kept yelling ""open the door!"" 

I immediately went to my bedroom and grabbed my gun and stood in the living room with my gun pointed at the front door and yelled that I had a gun and if he opened the door I would shoot him. He kept banging and trying to open the door. I called 911 with my free hand and told them to get there ASAP and explained the situation. As I was on the phone I still had my gun pointed at the door with my other hand and he was still trying to get in. I yelled at him ""if you breach the door I will shoot you!"" But it didn't deter him, he kept trying to breach the door. 

I told the 911 operator that I was going to shoot and possibly kill him if he broke through the door, she said to do what I had to do.

About 90 seconds after the initial 911 call the police arrived and arrested him. My adrenaline was pumping so hard that it took me hours to calm down, I got no sleep that night. 

It also made me realize that I never want to be in the position again where I have to potentially take the life of another person. I'm so glad he didn't breach the door. I hope this was the first and last time I ever have to draw my gun to potentially shoot another human being."

"You might feel differently if you found yourself in a relationship where it feels like their state of happiness rested solely on you, and they took no personal responsibility for their own emotional state. It's exhausting being the cheerleader in the relationship. Nobody can be the upbeat, bright-side person 24/7 that the other one relies on. You're basically stuck doing all the heavy lifting (emotionally, so to speak). This is not to say that you should never be giving, loving, their biggest fan, etc... but you gotta get that in return, too! Some folks are givers--get a lot of joy out of it--but only realize once they are truly exhausted and just need a little TLC themselves that they aren't getting much back in return.

It's not about being happy without them, or being happy single.  It's about if you are resilient enough to make the best of whatever situation you are in--single or in a relationship. Learning to be resilient is a great skill to bring to a relationship.

"As a teenager, I had a below-minimum-wage serving job at an upscale hotel. I was given a rack of wine glasses to polish for a fancy corporate dinner. No problem, the hotel had loads of cheap wine glasses and we polished dozens of racks of them in a day. It was a quick task if one applied pretty firm pressure to get the water spots off on the first try. So I set about polishing as usual. I tore big chunks off of three of them before my manager noticed and banned me from ever touching them again. My broke ass had never seen real crystal before. They were worth about $400. Each."

"Disliked the dude because everytime we went out drinking (we usually do after work drinks on Friday nights, as you do), he would get rowdy and loud in an annoying way. 

He was cool when I first met him sober, but goddam, he was annoying when he was drunk, wanted to drink to the crack of dawn,  pretty much overstayed our night's itenary (if that makes sense when put into the context of a random night out drinking). I just gave him the cold shoulder and eventually stopped talking to him. 

My friends stuck around for a bit, until the night said subject wanted to attack me whilst at our mutual friend's birthday because I was joking around with someone else around the area. 

Sensitive fuck... there were 10 others at the table who either know him, of him or never met him, every one of them was ready to pop off and whoop this guy the moment he pulled that shit on me...

And not to sound like a gangsta or anything, I was a little shooked when he threatened me... think about it, you are having a lot of fun, joking around in a relax environment, then next minute this guy threatens you.

Reasons:

2. I hesitate to equal Dollhouse and Westworld.  I loved both so much.  That said I do agree that after watching both I realized that about 75% of my ethical/philosophical/sociological questions I had about Westworld were mostly the same ones I had already considered after watching Dollhouse.  So there wasn't a lot gained on that front from Westworld.
3. Having people who haven't seen West Wing recommend Newsroom would definitely be infuriating.  But mostly if they'd watched the whole of Newsroom without seeing West Wing at all.  Because the first season of Newsroom was amazing, and more-or-less at par with the latter half of West Wing.  Aspersions further than that would make me a little cross."

I learned that her and her mom staged the wreck for insurance fraud. I was so happy because she was alive. But I was mad that nobody bothered to tell me all that time. Then I was woken up and realized it was all a dream. Her shitty excuse of a mother really did give her barely 14 year old daugher keys to take ger friend home. She did decide to try and show off by flooring the car on a gravel road and caused the car to flip multiple times. She was in the hospital for two months completely brain dead. And I had been in a fight with her for a while before this happened and too proud to let go of the petty anger. My best friend died thinking I hated her. Just like my father did when he committed suicide two months before that wreck. (I also held on to hard feelings with him.) Sorry that ended up more depressed than scary.

"Jc turkeys, man. I sometimes go for a jog around the small field/forest close to where I live, and there's a farm with some chickens and other generic animals there, the sheep are sometimes left to graze out in the field. 

But one day I came across a freaking turkey leading some girl-turkeys all pompously down the path I jog on. Saw me coming within like 50 meters range, immediately stopped and started that weird chortle sound, loud af. 

No way around them, and definitely did not want to just casually walk past him, he was huge. I spent quite a few minutes just figuring out how the hell am I going to get home. That bird was an asshat. "

When they stop trying, then their life obviously starts going downhill, and they feel like there's nothing they can do to stop it, because they have taught themselves that they're ""helpless."""

"Black mold may cause symptoms that may be diagnosed as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but I wouldn't say it causes CFS.  Researchers are still studying CFS and no one knows the true cause and it's likely multiple illnesses all lumped together due to a lack of actual tests that may be run.  Most recent theories surround  mitochondrial dysfunction... but there isn't enough research yet.

Black mold does not cause Epstein-Barr virus, obviously it's a virus, so it is spread virally.  Black mold may weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to Epstein-Barr.  Also, Epstein-Barr has links back to Chronic Fatigue, as it's often present in patients diagnosed with CFS."

"I'm not that sensitive to mp3 compression. 160kbps VBR sounds as good as lossless in blindtests to me. 

On the other hand, recording quality and mastering make a massive difference. Many mastering artists play the loudness war and end up clipping their signal. This results in less dynamic range. Recording methods such as the way the mics are set up can drastically change the spatial cues in a stereo recording. 

I usually find live recordings to sound the most lifelike. There are also a lot of really amazing electronic music where the artist is brilliant expressing spatial cues in their instruments. "

"Bulbasaur has the most advantage on the gyms and the wild areas. It breezes through Brock, Misty, Surge, Erika, Giovani, Loreli and Bruno. Also many wild areas is weak to it considering Rock, Ground and Water filled the majority of Kanto. 

Charmander: Only effective against 1 gym, the grass gym but beside that gym you can find Growlithe and Vulpix, making training Charmander early isn't really worthy.

Squirtle: It's SE against Brock, Blaine, Giovani, Bruno and Lance. It also has a better movepool than Bulbasaur.

Squirtle despite all of its advantage, water type is not needed until halfway when you get Surf and when facing Blaine. And Blastoise is also among the worst water in Kanto. Slowbro, Starmie, Cloyster, Gyarados and Lapras are arguably better options. Unliked Venusaur, its only competitor is Exeggutor in Gen1 (not anymore in Gen3). 

Charmander heavily relies on other pokemon to progress. While Bulbasaur can work alone until the Psychic and Fire gyms, by that time you have either an overleveled Venusaur or a full and good leveled team.

So Bulbasaur &gt; Charmander &gt; Squirtle"

"Treat women decently. Don't put women on a pedestal but don't look down on them either. That's the main thing really, once you can interact with women as if they're human because, spoiler alert, they are, it becomes easy to take it to the next level.

As for long term relationships, those are hard. You'll have to work for that every day, so find someone who's worth it. Never take your relationship for granted. And find someone who does the same for you. Good and stable marriages are between equals who trust each other.

Marriage is a different thing entirely. You're making a promise that ideally lasts a lifetime. Manage expectations, talk everything through. Details, wishes, wants, etc. You have to be able to talk about everything if you're going to make this commitment."

"I don't know you hun and I am single and way younger than you but I just want to let you know what your husband did was shitty and in no way is your fault. 

It's ok if he wasn't happy anymore but the fact he just left everything and told you to leave just like that is cowardly. 

I guess you haven't talked with your kids about the reason why he left? If your daughter is a daddy girl she might want to go and live with him, if he doesn't want that, another reason he is not good for his family. 

Don't think your death will repair a thing, it might help financially but emotionally? Your family will be forever broken, today your kids might think they are angry with you but if you do it they will blame themselves. They just don't understand the situation but every kid needs their mom, don't leave them because of money, they need you even if they are 80 they will always need their mom. 

I hope your life gets better eventually, I will have you in my thoughts. "

"I live in Alaska and we don't have reservations (except 1 or maybe 2?).  But many villages are dry - booze is not allowed to be sold or consumed.   There are also a few things Natives are allowed to do that other people can't do.  Natives can harvest ivory, can have eagle feathers and do whaling that others can not.  Up here in Alaska, Natives have special subsistence fishing and hunting rights on federal land.  Certain types of Native land are not taxed - in Alaska we have native allotments (up to 160 acres of land owned by individual natives).  There is also ANCSA which is the alternative to the reservation system.  ANCSA established native corporations and transferred 44 million acres of land to natives that are held fee simple (they are not reservation lands at all). ANCSA has its drawbacks but after reading this thread (especially the natives weighing in), I am more convinced than ever that it is superior to the reservation system.  I think Alaska natives have a higher percentage of people going to college, a higher percent working for their people than the native people living outside Alaska.  We also have tribes (different from the for-profit ANCSA corporations) and our tribal entities generally provide a comprehensive set of services in a very challenging environment - the state is huge and costs are very high.  I think we are doing better at preserving the cultures too.  Partly because we have not been relocated - as outside Indians have been.  We have thousands of natives living on the same land they've lived on for thousands of years.  The goal of ANCSA was to bring natives into the economy and to settle the land claims.  By some measures it has worked.  Collectively, native entities are the largest employers in the state, and Alaska Natives are the largest private land owners in the world.  We also have all the problems detailed in this thread.  But it sounds like we have a bigger percentage of people living very good lives.  

One last thing: poverty sucks but material wealth isn't everything.  I think poverty among native Americans is the symptom of spiritual dis- ease  that is a direct result of trying to live in a very materialistic world.  "

"I would say you're correct for some cooking methods, and incorrect for others.  

Most of the ""meat"" flavor comes from browning. Brown a chicken breast in a pan with a little salt and oil, and it tastes very different that if you boil it, or cook it in a slow cooker, or with another non browning method.  

When the meat isn't browned, I'll agree with you. The meat is mostly bringing texture to the party. Whether that's in soup, or tacos. The seasoning is the main star.  

On the other hand, when you grill a steak, or cook a burger, you don't really season these with much more than salt / pepper.  Maybe one or two spices, but rarely a complex sauce or marinade. You brown / blacken the meat, and let those flavors develop and come though.  

Why?  Well, the cooking process actually changes it chemically, and develops the flavors. As Alton Brown says, the best meat is the stuff stuck to the bottom of the pan. That's why you deglaze the pan to get those flavors back into your dish."

"Again, you can find out the answers to all of this in this thread alone, but what the hell, I'll answer. Full disclosure, I'm a Francoamerican white chick, so I could be dead wrong, but here goes. Any Natives/First Nations reading this, please let us know if I'm full of shit. 

Let's start with a briefish history lesson. Am on mobile, so sorry about formatting and typos. 

Natives are poor because the US government, historically and to this day, has been and remains massively corrupt, or, at best, incompetent. The reasons are long and myriad, but it boils down to this: Europeans fucked them over royally when they 'discovered' the American continent, and those that managed to survive the onslaught, both deliberate and accidental (it was part genocide, part disease and tribal warfare that wiped them out), were forcibly 'assimilated' into white society, sorta, as second-class citizens, and those that refused, were mostly killed, or otherwise squared off into ghettoes. These were early reservations, but make no mistake, this wasn't out of service to the Natives, it was a calculated act of war. Whites were basically damning the rebellious natives to a long, isolated life in a barren, desolate wasteland, where they became their own problem to deal with. This is because they didn't exactly give the Natives the sprawling, fertile, beautiful (sacred) land that was taken from them. Hell no. The piece of the pie the Natives got was the tiny slice the chihuahua managed to sneak off the table, and later shit out in a spluttery mess. Long story short, humanity evolves a little bit, white guilt seeps into mainstream, and they looked back at history, and thought (rightfully), 'Golly gee, we sure were colossal dicks to the redskins. Maybe we should make a half-assed attempt to rectify that somehow'. And while their intentions were good, they rectified the issue in the worst way possible: with zero foresight or long-term thinking, or any understanding of the many, nuanced complexities of how poverty and crime and oppression are self-fulfilling cycles of vitriolic desperation. It's basically the snake that eats its own tail. 

Anywhoo, whites felt bad, and looked at all the pretty land they took from Natives, and decided the best course of action was to give some of it back to them, as sovereign land, so they could scratch their good deed of the day off their collective to-do list. While this was a nice idea, like I said, there was pretty much zero lateral thinking behind it, and they effectively put a bandaid over just one symptom, rather than fix the cause. If good intentions pave tje road to hell, then the Reservation road was made of gilded shit. The Natives took this land, which was mostly better than the Mordor they were given last time, and in some places, actually quite nice geographically, but then a critical error was made: they gave those people sovereignty, while simultaneously funneling a pitiful amount of government funding to them. A sweet, but cosmically stupid idea, because now you have this group of disgruntled,oppressed, marginalized, impoverished people, squashed into a little fenced-in slice of heaven, where they are given little to no choice but to be entirely self-sufficient due to the teeny little fact that they were marginalized to begin with, which means that they weren't exactly found watering the roses along their white-picket fences. Combine that with the fact that the government gave them juuuust enough money to not have to work (in the beginning), and bam, a few generations in, you have a massive shitshow, because that was the perfect recipe for abject destitution. And like I said before, poverty is a vicious cycle, and makes monsters of us all. Don't think for one minute that you wouldn't do some questionable shit if it means not starving, because you would. You may think you're above that, but you're almost certainly wrong. When humans are brought down to survival mode, the animalistic side of us comes out. Hell, it comes out on fucking Black Friday. So imagine how bad it is when the thing you're trying to secure is not having your kids starve to death while your husband, miserable and angry with the world, drinks his sorrows away. 

Pretty much the only Natives that are wealthy from casinos would be those who are corrupt assholes and keep the money for themselves. Generally, those are the tribal elders. Not all reservations have casinos, and not all of them are directly feeding greedy, selfish people, but it does happen. I'm not sure where casino proceeds go, though. Almost all reservations, regardless of tribe, live in third-world poverty. Some more so than others, depending on tribal leadership, size, proximity to a larger city, geographical location, historical treatment, among other factors. 

That pretty much sums up my knowledge about this, at least in terms of answering your questions. "

"I've got a good life so I shouldn't complain, but I'm going to type this all out just to get it out of my head. I've got quite a few people I would consider very close friends, who I really love and I want them to be happy, but sometimes I can't tell if they feel that way about me. I think I'm a very touch-oriented person, if I could I would always convey friendship with hugs and physical contact, but I think because I'm male people assume I don't want that kind of thing or I only do for sexual reasons, which isn't true at all. Additionally, most of them are friends I have who I know through my Catholic church and I worry they wouldn't accept me if they knew I was bisexual. I planned it come out to a couple of my friends about a month ago but I got emotional and nervous and never got around to it. Most of my concerns are just ""but what if they hate me?"" over and over again, and jet lag has made my insomnia much worse the last few days so I've been left lying awake thinking about these things. The combination of all that leads me to feel lonely even when I'm with my close friends and family. 
On another slightly related note, I've had concerns that I might be trans for about the last 6 months. I don't think I am at this point, I think those are feelings mostly driven by being girly when I was a little kid, how being male affects people treating me differently (assuming I don't want hugs, thinking I'm always thinking about sex, etc.), and being bisexual, but sometimes I feel the really strong want to have breasts, kind of in flashes, and I wiry that I might really be trans, and how much that would change my life, and how much my friends might all hate me for it. 


Thanks for reading this, anyone who did. "

"This happened at my Junior Prom. Before I get into the bad part, I need to explain a few things.
1. Tickets were $50 per ticket.
2. My school was notorious for singling out those who weren't part of school club/athletic activities.

I wasn't going to go to prom, but my friend, JJ, and her group decided at the last minute that they weren't going to go, so she gave me, and a few of our other friends, her group's tickets. Around that time, a friend of mine asked me to go with him to the dance. I told him yes. It was my first prom, why wouldn't I say yes? Especially to a friend. I told him that he only needed to buy his ticket since a friend gave me hers. I realized something though, my friend's name was still on the back of the tickets she gave me and the others. We didn't care though, figuring it was just so they could be returned to her, in the event that she or someone in her group drop their tickets in the hall before prom.

Anyways, I'm excited and my Step-mother takes me to get a beautiful blue dress and gorgeous silver and blue sandals to go with it. Even my aunt, uncle, and little cousin, who lived four hours away, came down for the weekend so they could help me get ready/take pictures, ect. So the night arrives and I have my hair and makeup done, jewelry bought for the event, and I'm all dressed up. My date arrives and we take pictures together, then get into his dad's car and he drives us to the prom. We get there before the doors open and everyone is excited, my friends, who were going together and are both girls, were a bit late, but I didn't mind. 

As we got up to the desk where we'd hand over our tickets, I felt my stomach flip. They were crossing off NAMES whenever someone handed them their ticket and was let inside! Unknown to pretty much everyone who bought the tickets, once you bought them, your name was put on a list so they could figure out who paid and who didn't. We walked up to the desk and they found my date's name, but not mine. I stepped aside so the people behind us could get in and I went to the principal who was nearby. I told him that my friend had given me her ticket because she didn't want to come anymore and he didn't apologize or anything, he just said ""If you didn't buy the ticket yourself, you can't go in."" Basically, if you bought a ticket and decided not to go, you couldn't give your ticket to someone else because THEY wouldn't have to pay to go in! Fucking cheapskates! I told them it was unfair because of a couple things.

1. They announced the rules for getting into prom and receiving tickets, and they never said ANYTHING about this, and I know that because they announced it every day in the morning for a month beforehand.
2. I read the rules on the website, and they hadn't even updated them for that year, it still had the rules for the year prior.
3. It never said anything about this on the posters around the school either.

So I was denied entry and I was devastated. I told my date to go on in while I called my dad and aunt, who I knew could talk sense into the principal. My date had paid for his ticket, and I didn't want him to miss out on the fun, but he stayed with me. I called my dad and stayed calm and he said he'd be there in a minute (we lived only a few blocks away from where prom was being held). Then I called my aunt and I broke down, because I had been so excited for this, but I was being denied in because of a petty and cheap reason. If the ticket was paid for, what did it matter who used it? She told me to calm down and that she'd be there. 

While I waited, I met another girl who had been kicked out for the same reason. Her friend couldn't go due to a family emergency, so they gave her their ticket so it would be used. So it wasn't just me. My dad showed up not too long after, and he was pissed. Like, 'you hurt my baby girl' pissed. He approached the principal who kept refusing to let me in, stating that ""If she's not on the list, we can't determine whether or not she goes to this school."" Fucking really? He knows I go to that school, along with my other friends because he made it his mission to single us out because we didn't kiss the asses of the athletes. Yeah, it was THAT kind of school. I guarantee that if I was a cheerleader or softball player, I would have been let in regardless. The principal was scared of my dad, so he called security over and my dad asked if I had my school ID. I always kept it in my wallet in my purse (which I brought with me), so I said yes. I hoped that would be enough to verify who I was so they'd let me in. The principal refused, saying it didn't matter and that I wasn't going to get in. My dad told him that he was going to go to the superintendent of the school district about it, and that he should expect a very bad phone call. 

My poor date stayed with me the whole time and when I was going to my dad's car, I told him he could go in and have fun without me. He looked pissed (not at me) and said ""If you're not with me, what's the point?"" And he went home. So not only did they ruin MY night, they ruined HIS too, along with other students who were denied for the same reasons. I even called my friends and told them not to bother showing up because of it. They did anyway, mainly to see what the hell the problem was and the principal looked at them (One was wearing a tux because her dress she planned to wear got the zipper broken that day, and the other was in a regular dress, they were going as friends) and said ""You can't go in, but not because you're gay."" Like, what the hell?

I went back home and my step mom was livid ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" My aunt and uncle showed up and my aunt gave me a big hug, apologizing for how the night went. My dad said he'd call the school board the next day and I could stay with my aunt in her hotel for the night. She, my uncle, and my little cousin took me to eat at my favorite restaurant, Olive Garden, while I was still dressed up, telling me that they wouldn't let my dress and makeup go to waste. The waitress asked me if I was going to prom after dinner and we explained what happened and she got angry about it as well. 

My dad called the school board the next day and talked to the superintendent, who had no idea that this rule had been placed without his knowledge and he apologized profusely, saying that it should have never happened and that his own daughter was there and he'd react the same way if it happened to her. It also brought up concern because this school also charged tickets for, get this, the fucking GRADUATION! You had to BUY TICKETS for your relatives to see you get your diploma, and he got worried that they'd pull the same stunt there. My dad told him that me, along with the others kicked out, was to receive an apology, or he'd be suing the school for the money spent on my dress, makeup, hair, shoes, and jewelry. Also, he'd talk to the news station that broadcast in our state, and we all agreed to tell them what happened if we didn't get an apology. Our school valued face and any scandal was brushed under the rug (there was a huge sexting scandal involving the football team that was kept quiet because the team was going to state or something if that tells you anything), so this threat scared the shit out of them. The superintendent did nothing wrong, these rules were placed without his knowledge and he personally came to us at lunch later that week and apologized for what happened. "

I think, in my case, it's more important to understand that no, they will not always be able to make you happy, and that's ok. Caring about and valuing yourself take that place for me, and while other people caring about me make that easier, I cannot rely on that alone."

"We played D&amp;D. He was terrible.

As a player, he was always trying to be the center of attention - he was great at getting into character, but his characters were terrible. He'd wheedle and negotiate for combat bonuses. I learned how to ""play"" him eventually, largely by giving him excuses to run off and do his own insane side-mission while the rest of the group engaged in stuff like *teamwork* and *not being jerks*.

As a Dungeon Master, though... holy shit. His homebrew setting was practically sucking Steven King's dick. There were aliens, but they only existed to show how cool (white) humans were. He also wrote homebrew rules - which I'd done for my game, to be fair. However, where I tried to strip down the rules for speed and simplicity, he turned the simulationism up to eleven. It was kinda cool when we were keeping track of water as we trekked through the desert, but less so when he made a single combat (for one character) drag on for *three sessions* because the player in question ""hadn't beaten it yet"".

This was all on top of being a painfully mediocre chef - he'd cook for the group, which was really thoughtful, but he'd hold it over our heads if we pointed out that the food was unbearably bland, assuming he didn't just ignore us. It got so bad that we started chipping in for pizza on the regular. He was also low-key racist, to the awkward confusion of our one black player (also my best friend), and was enthusiastic about a number of conspiracy theories - many involving pyramids - despite being otherwise intelligent and well-educated.

Eventually we got tired of his shit. To this day, my best friend and I use this man's name as an adjective for such behavior, and use him as a barometer of what not to be."

"I was born just a couple months after the Internet started being publicly available, so I feel like I can answer this question. As far as early childhood, it didn't affect me much. It kinda sucked for anything fun until the bandwidth got good enough that you didn't have to walk away from a YouTube video to give it time to load or when you couldn't be on the phone AND the Internet at the same time. So I pretty much did the same kid stuff my parents did as a child. 

BUT, when I got into the ""you have to actually research things"" phase of school, it almost felt like cheating. I remember an encyclopedia CD my parents bought that was pretty much obsolete as soon as they bought it. I feel like, at least where I went to school, the system hadn't caught up with technology enough to realize the inefficiency of how they were teaching some subjects because the Internet existed. By the time I got into high school, they had started integrating it into the curriculum, but we got away with SO much stuff in middle school. 

One positive thing about it though was how much it broadened my horizons. Being from a place that didn't have a stoplight in the entire county, there wasn't much to see. But I could easily look at anywhere in the world and learn about it from people who have traveled or even lived there. That's something that no generation before me had ever been able to do, and the awesomeness of that has never been lost on me. 

Also, online gaming. When that first became a thing, we all went crazy. "

Data Entry Jobs: This includes Microsoft work typing jobs, legal document typing jobs, book typing, and converting JPG files to Microsoft word files.   
Transcription: A very straightforward and lucrative way of making money from home. A transcriptionist have to convert audio files into text files. Their are 3 types of transcription jobs: medical, legal, and general transcription jobs.

"This is pretty long but here you go: 
I got drunk for the first time at a friend's house whose family didn't know we were there...To make matters worse, we got shit faced off of Snapps and ate nothing but Doritos. The guy later pulls out a water bong that I hit for the first time in my life (great choice). Anyways, his room was at the top of a bunch of stairs, and I had to leave to go home because I started getting scared of how bad I felt. No surprise there but I didn't realize that my balance would be so messed up and had to painstakingly go down each stair, one by one, so his parents wouldn't find out we were there. I was drunk AND high, trying to make no noise and not die at the same time.

Half way down, I start getting nauseous, everything's swaying. I tell them I think I'm going to vomit and as soon as they start freaking out, I put my hands over my mouth and projectile vomitted down the entire stairs.
I was so embarrassed to be puking I tried covering my mouth and swallowing the vomit, which only made me vomit more. I was puking Snapps and doritos, so my vomit looked red and it completely covered the stairs, making it near impossible for me to get down without falling.
To fix this, my genius self got down on my butt and started sliding down each step, one by one, puke covering my ass and making it puddle down the stairs with me.
I ended up getting home safe, covered in red doritos puke. I never went back to the guys' house because I was so embarrassed he had had to clean all the vomit up. His parents never found out, though, which was a God damn miracle."

They all kept messaging me regardless. One of my friends would send a picture of something cool they saw that day. It was incredibly loving but at the time I still didn't have the strength to reach out.

When I finally built the courage to go see them, I found out they had been a united front in trying to help me. They had formed a little council that's main duty was making sure I was okay. I have a few different friendship groups and they had banded together. 

I'm getting teary just thinking about it. That level of love and care is so precious. I hope that I can return that support to them when they need it too."

"Wasn't entirely the case. Even with Franz dead, there were a lot of opportunities to stop a war. The exchanges between the diplomats, the untimely leave of Kaiser Wilhelm after the blank check, and the fact that Franz Ferdinand was a moderate aiming to ease unrest in  due to ethnic/cultural differences with a show of force. Nationalistic fervor was really booming at the time and some sort of diplomatic backlash would have happened anyway and it would be used as Casus Belli for an armed occupation at the least. Still, the mere difference of Franz Ferdinand's survival would have changed the entire course of modern history. "

2 weeks ago when we picked her up she told us that I was mean and nasty,  and that daddy was nice. This week she told us that daddy is mean and nasty,  and that I am nice. We are confused about what game he is playing, but he as always been a manipulator. None of this was happening before we filed for custody,  and he found out about me."

Long story short (and I've talked about my ex way too much on Reddit already) I never really completely loved her.  I had a crush on her, and managed to sustain that crush for the entire time we were together.  

The first warning sign I ignored was this one morning - and I remember it so clearly - when I showed up to her apartment after she'd been out the night before.  She came to the door in sweats, hair disheveled, a bit of puke on her clothes, smelling like the floor of a bar, and I thought at that moment that she was the most beautiful girl in the world.

I couldn't see the real person.  I was crushing on her, not in love.  That continued for years.  I failed to see her faults let alone accept them.  She was hot and I was stupid and even when she came out and said she didn't love me anymore and was leaving, I still had a crush on her.

I thought it was romantic and noble that I couldn't see her flaws.  That I loved her no matter what.  But it wasn't love.  It was a crush."

  In real life I don't ever talk to strangers, basically it's, work, networking with clients, school, pay debts. But not if i meet you in an online game.

  running around convincing people in an mmorpg that I'm selling my friend for 1 million gold. Challenging the same guy to a rematch after he beats me 7 times in a row and announcing ""tis only a flesh wound, fight me again, like a true man!"" every time. Swearing to haunt people in the afterlife. telling someone who shot me but was on my team that he ripped me from my loving wife and kids and he should be ashamed. 

  Anyway I just spent time confusing people and I don't know how to do it any other way. It's like my crack, I try to take it seriously but it's so easy to slip back into the old ways.

They have to work together to find a way to survive in such a dangerous environment and with the limited resources they have. Also, they have to stay naked the whole time.

I don’t understand why anyone would ever direct/participate in such a show.

No but its mostly my fault. I drive people away and isolate myself because it makes life easier.
I left my job in December after coming into some money.  Not a ton but enough that I could stay home and be with my son.  He's 16 and hates school.  I let him do online school but he still failed this last year.  He wants to drop out but I want him to keep trying.  Now my money is running out and I'm looking for work at home jobs. I was at my last job for 3 years. I'm still friends with people on facebook but no one checks in on me.  I have gone in there to say hi and I hear how they miss me but no one tries to talk to me after.  I feel alone.  And I feel like I've failed my son.  He's a fantastic kid.  Just doesn't want to try when school gets hard. I also miscarried in 2013 and she would be 4 here in September. I try not to say anything to anyone because it's my burden and people have said I shouldn't be sad anymore.  I have 3 cousins who all have kids that are 4. I love seeing them but it still hurts.  So lots going on and I have no one to talk to.  I really hate being depressed and I try to be happy and healthy.  But I really miss my friends.  And I wish they would reach out instead of me being a bother.

"I think most of the reason he was so unpopular was entirely in his image. He very much played the part of a politician rather than a leader. The blue-collar chicken farmers and watermen on the eastern shore didn't respect him. The people in (especially inner-city) Baltimore didn't dig someone who appeared so fake and silver-spoony.

I'll be honest, it probably has little to do with his performance as a governer and almost entirely to do with us just being tired of him and wanting nothing to do with that guy. He was simply a poor politician."

I don't have depression.  I just have crippling anxiety. I became an amputee in 2016.  I became an amputee because of a blood clot that formed in my leg while I was in a coma. Waking up to having one leg was pretty horrible. But I decided to go into this new life style as an amputee positively as I have always gone into every medical shit show of my life. But I'm beginning to realize how hard being an amputee actually is. Getting a job as an amputee is way harder than getting a job as a person with two legs. The way people look at me just gives me such bad anxiety that I actually spend a lot of time at home now. I just feel like my life is speeding by here I am 28 turning 29 in 2 weeks and I have nothing to show for it. I'm looking for a therapist but haven't found one I like yet. I just feel myself getting sadder and sadder. I'm really nervous I'm gonna do something irresponsible. Part of me wants to go to a psychiatric ward. But my boyfriend of 4 years doesn't think it's a good idea. I just i need someone to talk to. I'm beginning to hate myself and I really don't like being this way.

"Ah, but you are much more hip and cool, and with the times in your morals, right? No. I'll address your last paragraph to start with. It's not ""fairy tails"", it saddens me that you believe that, and I genuinely hope you reconsider, God is real. There has definitely been stuff that side with the fact that the Bible is true, but just out of curiosity, what do you believe in? How do you think we came about this earth? There was chariot wheels and such found in the red sea, which coincides with the story Moses. There was a canyon (or something of the like) formed, which many believe to be Noah's ark, as it measures about the same size and shape, if i am correct, of Noah's ark. Also, the Bible lines up in history with every event that was taken place, and I believe it is the oldest book to date. It's standards are so ancient, yeah it's old, must mean its irrelevant. Anything that anyone before the 2000's said? Nah they aren't hip enough to know the flawless moral standards we have today, they didn't know what they were doing, right? How exactly would they be a LITERAL CRIMINAL? Not only does that not make close to any sense, but even if I took it for what I believe you are trying to say, it still wouldn't be true. Gay's are still being killed in a decent bit of places, that's not criminal, thats the law. Transgenders are banned from a handful of nations. I don't know the moral guidelines completely in other religions, but I am sure there is many religions that follow similar guidelines, at least some of them. Now, how on earth is that criminal because I don't support gays? How is abstinence criminal? How is not taking the lords name in vein criminal? A lot of the ""morals"" that are so ""outdated and ancient"" you still follow today. Murdering people? That's a commandment in the bible. Lying? Obviously not against the law, but frowned on in many situations. Stealing? That's a commandment in the bible. In fact, you swear on the Bible when you go to court, I wonder why that is...

Now on to the rest of it. Just saying to start this off, your credibility went out the door after your 3rd paragraph, and even more so by your last. [Here is an article] (http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160627-i-am-gay-but-i-wasnt-born-this-way) and [Here is another one] (http://www.debate.org/opinions/do-homosexuals-choose-to-be-gay) that (the 2nd one) has both sides on it, but many people are for what im saying and such, feel free to read through. You are pretty sure that nobody comes out and say that they're choosing to be gay though, right? You either have no knowledge in what you are talking about or are just ignorant and trying to prove your side. Anyways, you going back to ""go and choose to be gay for a week"" doesn't apply, as I already stated, as we are born straight. I feel like you were kind of missing the point with the bestiality thing. I was saying you could say you were attracted to dogs, that doesn't mean you were born that way. You just like it, and it's a choice.   "

https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/

&gt;A compelling body of research is now available, from many leading academic researchers and from respected research organizations such as the National Bureau of Economic Research, the RAND Corporation, and the Urban Institute. No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelors degrees or higher, although some are forecasting high growth in occupations that require post-high school training but not a bachelors degree. All have concluded that U.S. higher education produces far more science and engineering graduates annually than there are S&amp;E job openings—the only disagreement is whether it is 100 percent or 200 percent more.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;unemployment among scientists and engineers is higher than in other professions such as physicians, dentists, lawyers, and registered nurses, and surprisingly high unemployment rates prevail for recent graduates even in fields with alleged serious “shortages” such as engineering (7.0 percent), computer science (7.8 percent) and information systems (11.7 percent).

They said ""hi new white people, welcome to our land"" and we said ""shut up you *Indian*, from *India*"", and the NAs said ""what is this India of which you speak?"" And we said ""oh, so this isn't India?

"Truth.

You exist, you act, and those actions are 'true'. they happened.

Then, as god, you erase the universe and build a new one.

Did not the prior exist as truth?

**Another example**:

you exist, go back in time and kill your grandparents, and *poof* out of existence.  Was not your existence true?

So, truth seems pretty variable to what can be known as true. Or, that in turn, what is true by what currently exists may have possible existence in truth beyond or substituted for what exists, in place, right now.

Why?

"The paradox of choice

Have you ever gone to a restaurant, and felt overwhelmed by a menu with too many choices? Intuitively, you'd think that if you give people more choices, and therefore more freedom,  they'd generally be more satisfied by their choices. But in practice, having too many choices often is detrimental to the chooser, because it leads to more stress and dissatisfaction. That's why most well designed apps strive to have as little options as possible."

Come the 1990s, the EEC ( European Economic Comittee) changed to become the current EU.

They are basically trying to do what the Kaiser attempted in WW1, and what Hitler wanted in WW2 - one country, one currency, 1 ruler, 1 army

The EU dictated what a country can and cannot do. How the hell is that fair?

But don't beat around the bush.

Sometimes they will be a little shy about phone numbers and maybe offer to give you a kik id. That's fine. Go with it. The important thing is to get things off Tinder as soon as possible. It's too easy to get lost in the shuffle if she has a lot of matches.

"I don't have a phd in Native American studies, no. Yes they got an unfair deal (the one forced upon them by the government). They deserve a lot more contiguous, sovereign land. But the truth is that under these reservation systems there is a unfair distribution of resources and no private land ownership by members. If they are going to have any chance to improve their lives they should be able to own their own land--and my understanding is that this is prohibited by either tribal law or us govt acts. The government agents and ""liberal"" allies of native Americans are the ones who benefit from the perpetually impoverished, captive spectacle of what was once a great society. "

"&gt; I hate equating car deaths to gun deaths, the primary use of a car is not to murder someone.

The primary use of a gun is not to murder someone either.

&gt;I don't understand how having a gun increases your quality of life.

There is a huge difference between inner city gun culture and rural gun culture.  Most of the population lives in a city and has only ever seen the gun culture of that environment.  It is difficult for me to describe without having experienced it.

There are many people in this country who use shooting sports as a primary means of entertainment and bonding.  They have family traditions, holidays, and core memories built around the use of these guns, to say nothing of the industries themselves and all the jobs they support. 

Guns are also much more necessary for people in rural environments for safety. I have had several occasions where having a gun saved my family and my livestock from a wild animal that had rabies and intended us harm.  I would have likely lost my livelihood without one.  Also, there are many places in the country where cops are more than 30 minutes away, that have no cameras or security devices, so there is little deterrent for crime other than the possibility that someone on the place is armed and home."

"I am simply suggesting that we remove the sovereign government aspects of the reservations and ""county-ize"" them.  Then they become parts of the states or provinces they live in, and they contribute and receive benefits of the whole state and local government levels, as well as crucial oversight.

I do not want actual cultural assimilation as a specific project.  There may well be assimilation that comes of this, but it will be the choice of the people living there.  Maintaining up to date educational and solid law enforcement actions will allow younger people to leave and get good educations.  Then they will have a real choice.  That choice could end that culture after the elders die out, but that would be the choice of the young people, which they should have every right to.  

The best way to atone for screwing up their ancestors' cultures and lives is to allow them to benefit from what we built on their bones.  Otherwise, we're just massaging our own guilt, while at the same time, actually denying them the positive aspects of what came out of the conquering culture.

* Some of these civilizations might develop interstellar travel, a step the Earth is investigating now.

That are simple and maybe a slight bit hipsterish or rock liking. I could keep on going but the point is that I have a very defined type. You can almost immediately tell if a woman os my type or not so that woman passing by is not so likely, (In fact I honestly don't know how to meet women of my type but that is another story). The same logic applies to many people.

"People understand more than I think you think

1. There is no singular thing that is conciousness. There is no ""you"" running or even watching the show. There are a bunch of semi-independent tracks simultaneously doing their own things (basic visual processing, object recognition, motion tracking, assigning identities to faces you see, etc). Some tracks are more closely connected than others and are able to modulate each other's activity (hey, that's the cute new guy, pay attention to where hes walking) Or even their own activity from the top down via feedback loops (hey that looks like the cute new guy but I'm not sure, spend some extra time figuring it out instead of moving on to the person next to him). Every once in a while disparate tracks get connected and can end up passing weird info back and forth like in synesthesia (hey, that's the cute new guy, seeing his face makes me literally taste strawberry).

Based on 1. it makes sense our brains are mostly modular. It's not that visual processing areas function differently than audio areas but that they're plugged into the overall system of inputs and outputs. We see because that's what the brain does with that kind of input. The revolution happening in machine learning (deep learning) is based on compsci guys finally applying this principle and creating an algorithm that imitates it. Give a deep learning algorithm visual input and it learns to see. Give it audio and it learns to hear.

Those algorithms basically work via hierarchical abstraction and classification. Take your pixel array, group it into lines, group the lines into shapes, shapes into things, pass that off to the face area (hey this thing looks like a face, figure out who it is. Oh it's that cute new guy). That's basically how the brain works too.

To start to move towards what people are really talking about when they talk about conciousness, what is thought at the most basic level but multimodal hierarchical abstraction and classification? Chair is the abstract classification built from all things we recognized as particular chairs. Sitting is an action built from a bunch of individual muscle movements. Sitting in a chair is an abstraction combining both. As the brain gets more abstract it gets more recurrent so we can feed abstractions into other abstractions like language and use that to exert more top down control (My friend said the cute new guy is sitting in the red chair so I'm going to go find him requires understanding the abstract classification that each of those words represents, coordinate muscle activity to survey and move about the room, and make the higher level visual areas simultaneously look for red chairs and cute new guys, whichever comes first).

If you built something that does all that it would be an extremely intelligent robot. Maybe though you still don't think it's conciousness in the way you think people are. But as I said at the start, there is no you the way you think there is either. Split brain studies and experiments demonstrating decisions made before awareness of those decisions show that we basically just make stories up as we go. There are tons of ways to interrupt that process but usually they go along pretty well. That's why brainwaves can be used as a proxy for conciousness sometimes, the show everything is operating in sync and there aren't major gaps between what the different tracks are doing. A lot of mental illness though comes when that smooth operation begins to fail. There's some evidence schizophrenic brains have tracks that are too connected to function properly. In certain phases of sleep where you aren't dreaming your brain is just doing random shit cleaning out cellular garbage and the only coordination between tracks is the base level necessary to keep living. As you dream coordination increases but theres no sensory input so your brain starts with noise and then runs over it enough times that it turns into thought and ideas based on abstractions it already knows. (Look up deepmind dream to see computer algorithms do a similar thing).

The last big piece that people often group in with conciousness is feeling or emotion. There's been a lot of work on how much of what we call feeling is shifts in our physiological state. On top of that, because there is a top down feedback in the brain, the other big piece is modulation of brain function. The feeling of fear is a combination the physical feeling in your gut and the tracks of your brain that get extra resources. Same with sexual arousal (The cute new guy touched my arm. My stomach tightens, my brain starts to pay more attention to physical touch and ignoring abstract concepts my plans for the night, etc)

Acting like ""we"" don't know anything about conciousness is like saying there's no picture on a low def tv. Maybe we don't have all the details or as crisp a picture as we'd like but we have a lot of information about what it is and how the brain does it"

"2 drinks is going to be around 200 calories on the low end. Say, 2 beers.

Which is 1400 calories a week 

Which is 72800 calories per year.

So you'd have to cut out 200 calories from your diet, daily (give or take) in order to avoid gaining roughly 20 pounds from *just* alcohol.  

You can eat healthy foods and exercise and gain weight.  Calories in, calories out will still apply.  So to accommodate 200 calories, you'd have to cut back that amount in food, in order to drink and not gain weight.

Edit: I just went and checked average calories for a beer - which is roughly 150 calories.  So 2 beers a day is around 300 calories.  Most people burn less than 300 calories at the gym. "

"I used to have this friend named Sheridan in high school. In 10th grade we met but we didn't really talk that much, 11th was about the same but senior year we became really, really good friends.

We hung out everyday and used to tell each other all about our girlfriends and such. He was my most trusted friend at the time, which was kind of weird for me since I had some weird trust issues from always getting other friends using me and not really wanting to be my friends.. if that makes sense
But that's not important.

Anyways, there's an amusement park called Lagoon a few miles from where we live, it's a pretty fun place and it's a good hang out spot in the summer for teens. We spent the entire year being friends and when the amusement park opened for the year in early June, we decided we'd both ask out a girl if they wanted to go to the amusement park with us and just hang out for the day.

I ask out two girls before one says yes, he only needs to ask out one.

The day there was pretty fun, we went on rides, played the side games, at lunch and dinner there, and overall had a really fun time.

Towards the end of the evening we decided to switch into our swimming suits (which we had brought with us) and go to the waterpark section of the amusement park.

So, we get our stuff and go into the water park. We haven't changed into our swim suits yet so the girls go into the girl locker room and me and Sheridan go into the boys locker room.

For some reason, Sheridan got really self conscious about his body all of the sudden. I asked him jokingly what was wrong and he got very offended, saying things like, ""Fuck off, dude."" and ""Leave me the fuck alone.""

I'd be joking with him, but he sounded very serious, so I decided to lay off and get dressed. Instead of getting dressed with me he runs with his swimming suit into a bathroom stall. I get dressed and go out of the locker rooms to wait for him.

After 5 minutes the girls come out but Sheridan still hasn't come out. Another 5 minutes goes by and me and the girls are starting to get worried. I tell them I'll go check on him.

I walk into the locker room and can see his feet and clothes everywhere under one of the stalls. (The locker room and bathrooms were in the same room, by the way, this might be confusing)

I thought he was masturbating so I get a genius plan to pop out under the stall and say ""boo"" or something.
I creep up to the side and slide under the stall and shout ""STOP MASTURBATING""

He was masturbating. But that's not the bad part, I expected that. The scary part was I discovered he was a hermaphrodite. I would have never known. I have nothing against hermaphrodites but I was absolutely shocked at finding this out. It explained why Sheridan was self conscious about taking his clothes off in front of me and everything.

He started freaking the fuck out when he saw my facial expression change so quickly.

""DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK? OH, GOD"" he kept saying over and over. I kept saying ""sorry"" as much as I could but he was absolutely furious.

I felt absolutely awful, still do in a way. I get him to calm down and he starts yelling at me, ""I need you to never tell anyone.""

I say something like, ""Ok dude, I will never tell anyone, I promise. Is there anything else I can do?"" , he responds, ""No."" but I keep insisting that I do something else for him. He keeps telling me no, so I suggest we go swimming now. As we're walking out he says, ""Wait, I need something else."" ""What do you need?"" I ask. ""I need about tree fiddy.""

It was around this time I realized Sheridan was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damned Loch Ness monster had gotten me again! ""Damnit Nessie, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!"" I yelled as he swam off into the distance.

I didn't get laid that night, neither did any of those girls. I'm sure they were confused when I tried to tell them the story and they probably didn't believe me."

No ideas, no conviction, no leadership, no strength just Brexit means Brexit and Strong &amp; Stable... that worked well didn't it? The US really is in for a rough time but so are we and the worst thing is both situations are self inflicted. Good times:)"

"It's only half of the story my friend.

Here's my perspective : We as a society became way more open to be free and feminine,I don't get shit for wearing pink,if I get raped the people close to me wouldn't shame me etc.

Now if I am accused of rape all the feminists will jump my ass to kill me basically in the media,or if I'm being near children then it's the woman who calls the cops on me because in her mind ""man = rapist,pedophile"" and that's an image that was created/made stronger by feminists.

So no,I don't need feminism.

I need a movement that will stop sucking up to women/black people etc. because they were opressed by ""my"" (not really) ancestors and giving them rights that they don't deserve just because they are an ""opressed"" group. (Aka. the victim card)

MRA makes a public meeting to talk about men's issues?Lol nope here we feminists will come with honks and csll them fascists without knowing the meaning of the word because white straight men never have problems in life!Impossible!Patriarchy!

" Duke Hwan of Khi, 

 First in his dynasty,

 Sat under his canopy 

 Reading his philosophy;

 And Phien the wheelwright 

 Was out in the yard

 Making a wheel.

 Phien laid aside 

 Hammer and chisel,

 Climbed the steps,

 And said to Duke Hwan:

“May I ask you, Lord,

 What is this you are 

 Reading?”

The Duke said: 

“The experts. The authorities.”

And Phien asked: 

“Alive or dead?”

 “Dead a long time.”

 “Then,” said the wheelwright,

“You are reading only 

 The dirt they left behind.”

Then the Duke replied, 

“What do you know about it?

 You are only a wheelwright.

 You had better give me a good explanation

 Or else you must die.”

The wheelwright said:

“Let us look at the affair 

 From my point of view.

 When I make wheels, 

 If I go easy, they fall apart,

 If I am too rough, they do not fit.

 If I am neither too easy nor too violent

 They come out right.  The work is what 

 I want it to be.

 You cannot put this in words:

 You just have to know how it is.

 I cannot even tell my own son exactly how it is done,

 And my own son cannot learn it from me.

 So here I am, seventy years old, 

 Still making wheels!

 The men of old 

 Took all they really knew

 With them to the grave.

 And so, Lord, what you are reading there

 Is only the dirt they left behind them.”"

"What really pisses me off is when people drive like total assholes for no reason at all. Speeding in the left lane I get. 

But cutting you off just because your lane seems slightly faster? Do those people have the IQ of a brick? If you observe traffic for any amount of time you can tell it doesn't ultimately get you anywhere. 

Ironically, the reason why traffic is stop and go is because of those people. Someone cuts you off, everyone behind him has to slam on their brakes, and the wave goes all the way back. 

If they just drove smoothly traffic would literally go twice as fast and it wouldn't be a miserable experience. "

"Not true. I work closely with people from the US in engineering and we always have to calculate the measurements on our drawings into inches because even engineers in the US can't handle mm without problems.

Apart from that there are huge benefits for everyday lives to have a measuring system that has easy relations between different units.

""In metric, one milliliter of water occupies one cubic centimeter, weighs one gram, and requires one calorie of energy to heat up by one degree centigrade—which is 1 percent of the difference between its freezing point and its boiling point. An amount of hydrogen weighing the same amount has exactly one mole of atoms in it. Whereas in the American system, the answer to ‘How much energy does it take to boil a room-temperature gallon of water?’ is ‘Go fuck yourself,’ because you can’t directly relate any of those quantities.” - Wild Thing by Josh Bazell"

I get why people see it as not fully condemning Nazi's but in reality, he did, he just also pointed out that there was also violence from other groups that should be pointed out to.

He definitely could have approached the situation better though, he just has a special way of putting his foot in his mouth. "

And when gigantic volcanic outbursts had massively polluted the upper atmosphere, weather patterns had reverted to normal within a few years. This set strict limits on how far the climate system could drive its own variations independent of outside forces...But these divergences were within limits set by the overall long-term average global warming. In fact, it had become a test of a good model that it should show fluctuations and variations, just as the real climate did. For predicting future climates, it became common practice to run a supercomputer model a few times (usually three to five), with slight variations in the initial conditions. The details of the results would differ only modestly, and the modeller would confidently publish an average of the numbers. To be sure, the models were built to be stable."

You don't seem keen on sources yourself so why is the onus on me?

It's like orange juice.  Orange juice has vitamin c, therefore it's been marketed as being a healthy choice.  In reality, it's loaded with sugar, and you can get vitamin c rather easily through greens, peppers, broccoli, and other sources that aren't loaded with sugars.  Therefore, the marketing of orange juice being healthy is misleading.  Similarly: There are things in wine that are beneficial to your health - but nothing you can't get from other food sources.  The alcohol in wine is not the part that is beneficial.  "

"Lol it's the experience of marriage that counts.  

And yes 50/50 states don't mean that in practice, I will give you a prime example.  In a 50/50 state with mandatory child support done via calculation (to be neutral though in practice it's dis-proportionally impacts men hence it's really an intentional backdoor policy to screw them and intentionally so) the way you get around this is immediately file a baseless TRO (which has a low bar of proof as it's a civil standard) and that immediately costs the guy custody even if completely unfounded because by the time it's all figured out, EVEN IF YOU BEAT IT (which you rarely will), the child has already been ""sole"" custody of the false filer for often a year+ and at that point the court will decide it's in the best interest of the child to remain that way to not disrupt their life.  It's an open secret family courts do not punish perjury by women so there is zero downside as a women to file. I've flat out seen Family Court judges tell women at the bench, off record, that immediately following court when he rules against her they should go two doors over, file a frivolous TRO, and then come back and he will change his verdict.  And even if you magically are the black swan as a chick and lose, if you look at the statistics only something like 1% of deadbeat mom's are ever actually forced to may the child support they are in arrears of even when they do joint custody and none of them are ever jailed.  As a guy if you go to your states child support enforcement agency and demand an audit of the mothers income to reduce child support you will get told to bugger off but women can file, and they will support, annual audits of the dads income which not surprisingly never ends up reducing child support even if he makes less or she more; at best it remains the same.  Don't confuse whats on paper with actual practice of family courts.

I spend a lot of time around family courts and the only way as a guy you are getting a fair divorce is to go nuclear immediately.  Don't move out, don't leave, don't give her the kids, etc.  When you decided to divorce (or if she serves you) immediately file your own false TRO against her claiming physical abuse; make sure you also call a domestic abuse hotline and spend that first week or so in a family shelter (for documentation). If you are serving before you file your first preliminary paperwork drain everything from every account including your retirement (the 40% hit you will take for early retirement is less than the 50% hit you take giving it to her plus it's more satisfying) and give it a friend in cash (perfectly legal as long as it's done pre-filing); in court say you simply hit a low point in life and blew it on strippers and beer to cope with the abuse (also perfectly legal).  Ring up shit loads of debt on all joint credit cards that way best case she eats half of it; you can also ""assume"" the whole thing which makes you look reasonably in front of the court as a bargaining chip.  Immediately change all passwords, remove joint accounts, destroy all past emails, records, etc anything that could be used in discovery (PRIOR TO YOUR FIRST FILING.  ONCE YOU FILE MOST OF THIS STUFF IS BORDERING ILLEGAL TECHNICALLY); remember divorce is a civil process so different burden of proof, the 4th/5th won't protect you.  Once you file only communicate via email, SMS, and letters; ensure all emails/SMS/letters have electronic/USPS delivery notifications on them.  Never meet in person (for fear of your safety OFC), do not communicate via phone, and if she shows up for any reason simply file a new TRO if yours expired and claim she is still threatening/harassing you.  For important documents notarized everything.  Also always pre-preemptively file if you can, it's always better to be the first mover on a divorce.  Always be the more reasonable party but if she misses a single date, immediately move for divorce via default.

She will do all of this even if she doesn't think about it because her lawyers, the judges, her friends, the child support agency, etc will all counsel her on how to milk the system to fuck you over to the maximum extent possible. You need to preempt everything."

"I have some kind of muscle illness or a problem with my nervous system. It basicly looks like a muscle tremor but when I pick something heavy up the tremor gets increasingly stronger depending on the weight of what I pick up. I spent 3 months worth of time in diffrent hospitals where they looked at absolutely everything. All organs checked, muscles checked, annoy liquid checked etc. The thing that the doctors just couldn't understand was that on one day when they checked the electric currents in my muscles everything seemed fine. On the next day however it looked completely abnormal. They actually went as far as checking me for stds because no one had a clue what's going on. So the diagnosis literally says I'm perfectly healthy. So to counteract that weird disease I thought I should hit the gym, which I am now doing. I'm trying to increase the weight I can carry before the tremor kicks in. I guess it has a good side effect of me being way more healthy as a gamer. And I also look better, so that's great."

"Every one of those remedies you mention is within the scope of authority of Congress.  For that matter Congress can even pack the Supreme Court and get enough justices to overturn the judicial precedence you state is a constitutional issue.

Rather than going to an extreme though, it is something that laws enacted by Congress can change where jurisdictional issues can be dealt with.  If it will take a constitutional amendment, then perhaps one needs to be drafted and for this to become a real national issue in terms of how native reservations are addressed in the context of federal, state, and reservation sovereignty.

I'm presuming that due to the Navajo tribal court system being well established as well as the Navajo constitution that guarantees civil rights as well as submission to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn decisions of that tribal court system that they are given a much more free hand in terms of enforcing tribal laws (like speed limits on public highways going across the reservation).

I do find it a bit weird at how shocked they are when someone they attack fights back though. It's like they think they have a right to assault people without consequences.

Probably they keep their faces covered in part due to legal repercussions, but largely...because they're ashamed of themselves.

"Thats great - Germany is welcome to run their country however they want.

I'd think a country with Germany's history would be extra careful about allowing the government to restrict speech. The last time that happened worked out very poorly.

&gt;If democracy allows actions that destroyes the democracy itself, it is defenceless and vulnerable. Thus, to defend yourself from systems like fashism, socialism or communism, the state needs the power to act against abusive speech, meaning exactly the speech that I discribed.

Ridiculous conclusion. It requires so many assumptions that frankly require ignorance of history to believe that its not even worth discussing. 

&gt;The only good thing about the current US is that the skilled demagouge you have is a terribly idiot so that he was not able to destroy the american system like Hitler did with Germany.

First, fuck you for comparing Trump to Hitler. The largest stain on modern human history does not compare to minor disagreements you have with our President. Conflating the two is shameful and disrespectful to the people affected by that.

Furthermore, America's protection on free speech is another roadblock Germany no logner has, so when the next Hitler tries to squelch free speech and flood the streets with propaganda, just like he did in 1930s Germany, there is at least a large hurdle to clear instead of declaring it ""hateful"" and lighting the world on fire again.

"Dog ownership should be severely restricted.. Too many people just don't have the space and/or training to appropriately handle a dog. Due to the limited space/training, not only does the dog suffer, but the nearby neighbors of said dog owner suffer as well.

The minimum requirements for dog ownership IMO should be as follows: 

-no residential structures within 250 feet of your property line.. this is so that neighbors aren't rudely woken up at midnight from your pet's constant barking.

-minimum 1 acre of fenced land for your dog (with each additional dog requiring an additional 1/4 acre).. This is for 2 reasons. 1 - so that the dog doesn't leave shit in your neighbors yards &amp; 2 - so that the dog has the ability to get the exercise that it requires without being restrained by a leash.

-owner must get a license to prove that they are capable of training/caring for/controlling the dog... I think the reasoning for this is obvious, and yet, I know many people who should have no business having pets but do anyway.

-Taking the dog off the owner's property must be done with a permit... This is to protect people from annoying dogs on bike trails, sidewalks, etc. Also protects people from having to deal with people bringing their pets to family gatherings (no! your dog isn't welcome at my house for my cookout! don't bring them!)."

"Scientifically, life begins at conception.

I'm not sure where you're getting the impression that I care about what other women do with their bodies when it doesn't affect someone else.

Do I care if a woman gets a tattoo of her moms favorite flower? Nope. Do I care if she pierces her lips? Nope. Do I care if she takes the life of another person? 100%, yes, because she is now doing something that affects other people, particularly the person that she's murdering. "

"Not a universe that is enough like ours to even share it's universalities, it's irrevocably true laws. In a multiverse scenario, it's possible for a universe to exist where one may create a rock so heavy you can't lift it while simultaneously being able to lift it, but what else must be true in order to allow that to occur? The state of that universe might be so unrecognizable and adhere to such a vastly different set of laws that to acknowledge this logical possibility without also acknowledging it's unrecognizable state would seem to me to be optimistic at best. Like, sure it's possible a universe exists where sound is a physical substance and atoms are larger than mountains, but what kind of universe would that actually be? It would be meaningless from our vantage point here. So yeah, a universe probably exists where a god can create a rock so heavy even he can't lift it, but only if we ignore or current ideation of what it means to be a god, to create, to exist within our particular state of reality.

"It's subtle but it's very clear that Sansa was sending away Brienne because she was contemplating having arya dispensed with (ok so she probably hadn't definitively made any decision).  Littlefinger plants the seed very deliberately during their earlier conversation: he points out that Brienne is sworn to protect Arya too (*wink wink* *nudge nudge*), and lo and behold, Sansa commands Brienne to gtfo of winterfell, despite her protests..  Already in earlier episodes commentators have noticed that Sansa and Cersei sported the same hairstyle (GoT is big on this type of symbolism), and remember two episodes ago Jon ruminates that Sansa almost seems to admire her. Rather than seeing Arya's big confrontation with Sansa as an over-reaction to the letter, I think it is more of a badass warning from Arya that she is not to be trifled with.. 

If you think I'm alone in seeing this, check out the WaPo recap of the episode (or others). I am not the only one who noticed that Sansa was seriously considering neutralizing Arya somehow to make sure that the lords would never see the letter."

I would probably condemn Nazis/KKKs in future events but not with ""big"" words. Meaning I'd probably say something like ""To those of you exercising your free speech rights on the right, don't get violent. Stop it, just stop it."" I don't really care about only ""bashing"" the Nazis/KKKs because they are no way voting for anyone else but me. They will understand I said what I said because I had to and not that I wanted to. And by saying this, MSM would be unable to attack my response and would in fact likely compliment me which I can use as ammunition against MSM.

Depending on how important the Meuller thing is, I'd do things differently. I have no idea how important it is as only Trump would at this time. If it's actually a big smoking gun thing or whatever, I'd do whatever I can to cover it up. Violence maybe if necessary (no murders though) and definitely blackmail/bribery if possible. Threats may be necessary if they might work. However, if not I'd start a campaign in which I attack democrats for spreading fake news and saying how mueller is a shill for the democrats and is being paid by soros. Trump voters would eat that shit up and Republicans would be afraid to impeach me as there would be strong outrage by their constituents. I would reiterate plans for MAGA, walls, healthcare, etc. and hold rallies again. If I legitimately didn't collude with the Russians, I wouldn't do a thing about this and would let meuller find no evidence at all and then spam that shit everyday to discredit MSM and democrats.

"Read the whole law please. This is straight from the link you posted, less than a paragraph down from your quote:

&gt;776.031 Use or threatened use of force in defense of property.—

&gt;(1) A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, except deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to prevent or terminate the other’s trespass on, or other tortious or criminal interference with, either real property other than a dwelling or personal property, lawfully in his or her possession or in the possession of another who is a member of his or her immediate family or household or of a person whose property he or she has a legal duty to protect. A person who uses or threatens to use force in accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat before using or threatening to use such force.

&gt;(2) A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force only if he or she reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. A person who uses or threatens to use deadly force in accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground if the person using or threatening to use the deadly force is not engaged in a criminal activity and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.

If someone is breaking into my car, I can draw on them. If they don't leave immediately, I can shoot them. My initial quote was a summation from a defense attorney's website. Considering the very next line item in the law allows you to draw on someone breaking into your unoccupied vehicle, I think we can both see that specifying occupied is largely unnecessary for the scenario I laid out."

My love for myself or another human being will always outweigh that of an animal. That doesn't mean I don't love them. I have 9 pets. I'm also not gonna avoid pet food that kills animals either, because that's inhumane, they are not biologically set up to be made vegan.

If you look at history, our actions prove we're pretty nasty animals. We do seem to be evolving to be more benevolent.  I only judge the individual meat eaters who are dicks about it. Seriously, if you don't even acknowledge those poor animals  are suffering horribly, you're pretty much trash. Have a little respect for them. If you're not occasionally horrified by how they're treated, then you're probably a psychopath with 0 empathy. I don't mind jokes though.

Christmas comes around and I open a gift (from mom) revealing a Kindle.  I immediately look at her and then to my sister (we're both late 20's then) and ask her if she wants a Kindle.

"&gt;False - sugar still in the fiber matrix is digested differently.

There's tons of research on juicing, I'm not gonna argue about it.  But again, we're comparing pre-packaged processed garbage juice drinks from brands like Minute Maid to freshly squeezed/blended juice, they are totally different nutritionally and freshly squeezed juice does not lose much nutritional value and the sugar is mostly the same.  It's the factory processing to mass produce pulp-less juice drinks that's mostly responsible for the issue you're talking about.

&gt;Also people don't drink the juice equivalent of one orange, which would be a couple tablespoons. They drink the juice of 4-8 oranges at once

People over-drinking doesn't make juice itself unhealthy though.  Mix it with other juices, ideally purees instead of fully liquid juices.  A juice bar isn't serving you 4-8 oranges in a single drink either.

I actually have a theory that our base 10 numerical system is not adequate for the processing of information at that scale. I don't know what we could use instead but since base 10 has inconsistencies such as pi and 3.33 repeating, it is not adequate for use with extreme equations.

"&gt; IT HAS BEEN THE CENTER OF MOST INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS

Religion is a super excellent tool for controlling masses of relatively uneducated people. Give them morals and guidance, ways of acting then tell them that a big ol' magical god will reward them, push that into them from when they are tiny little children and they'll believe it for the rest of their lives.  
  
Whole lot easier than educating your peasants and a super effective tool.

"Just because there are homes that are vacant doesn't mean that there are homeless people who deserve those homes. Those homes still need someone to maintain them, and the owner currently either does that or has abandoned it and it's a shithole.

Just because you give someone a house, doesn't mean they'll be able to maintain it or to suddenly get a job. Homeless people are homeless for a reason. They're either drug or alcohol addicted, mentally disturbed or retarded, or just complete criminals (I know, there is like a 1% of normal people who end up homeless -- they are the exception, not the rule, and do not spend their entire lives that way like the other 99%). 

There is obviously a glut of houses due to government subsidies to housing (the mortgage interest and property tax deduction credits, easy lending policies that have continued despite the crash in 2008, etc.) and hopefully the banks who own those empty homes finally get to take huge losses instead of getting taxpayer bailouts when the housing bubble pops again."

On a local level, the world become an increasingly unsafe place throughout the sixties and seventies, increasing in unrest and serious crime until the nineties, dropping in crime with a swing to the hard right until 2007-2008 when the left rose again in the west and leading again, to an increase in a lack of safety and a rise in crime.

The right at no point ever committed the crime, and at no point that I'm aware of.

The left however, decided to blame the right for problems they caused, and instead of facing their own shortcomings, shrieked in ever increasing desperation as none of their plans worked, always backfried, and lead to worse and worse problem.

It already reached it's peak, and there will be more conflict until the radical left is put down again, and the circle goes around and around.

At the age of two she can be a bit difficult with some food (which is perfectly normal), but most of the time she will completely clear a plate/bowl. And one of the weird things about being a parent is, you feel so proud over trivial stuff like this. Therefore she mostly hears ""well done for eating it all up! I'm so proud, you little fatty!""

"Jesus Christ, that man's wiki page brought a bunch of revelations I never knew about.

""Frequently criticized posts of his from August included one in which Zimmerman called Obama an ""ignorant baboon"";[79] one in which he posted an image of Vesper Lee Flanagan, an African-American former news reporter who shot and killed two ex-coworkers during a live broadcast, and wrote, ""If Obama had a son..."";[80] and another in which Zimmerman typed, in response to people who wanted him killed, that the United States understands ""how it ended for the last moron that hit me"" (in reference to Trayvon Martin).[81]

In September 2015, Zimmerman retweeted a photo of Martin's slain body posted by another Twitter user, who had the caption: ""Z-Man is a one man army"". Several days later, Zimmerman posted a letter saying that the photo in the original tweet was marked as “sensitive” and was blocked, so he retweeted it because of the text message without seeing the photo.[82][83]

In December 2015, Zimmerman tweeted two photos of a topless woman he claimed was his ex-girlfriend, and accused her of cheating and of the theft of his firearm and money. He included her phone number and e-mail address on his tweet. Less than two hours later, Zimmerman's Twitter account was suspended by the administration of the resource, according to their policy against posting another person’s private and confidential information, including e-mail addresses, phone numbers and familiar photos.[84][85] Zimmerman's tweet included a statement against Muslims.[86]

And, of course, this gem:

""On May 11, 2016, Zimmerman posted what was planned to be the auction of the firearm he used to shoot Martin. The post, in which Zimmerman wrote the gun was ""an American Firearm icon"", attracted controversy. ""


I used to be one of Zimmermans defenders, but if his actions post the shooting have proven anything, it's that he's exactly the monster the media made him out to be, Democrat or not."

"Edit: Dude asks why it's different, I explain why it's different, and here come the right-wingers with the downvotes. Bring it on you insecure man-children. I welcome your hate.

Dude, there is no ""more and more socially acceptable to be racist against white [sic]."" What there is, is a greater understanding of how white supremacy, unconscious bias, and structural racism work together to belittle and oppress non-white folk in the US. Also, it's not a legitimate question because it totally fails to take into account the completely unequal starting points of this argument. 

A good illustration of this is something that is going around social media right now. If I ask you about your heritage, where your family's from, you can say with some degree of certainty that so-and-so was from England, or Germany, or Italy going back however many generations.  

If you ask an African-American the same question they literally cannot answer you, because they don't know. Their heritage was erased by slavery and white supremacy. Their heritage is slavery now. 

No one is asking you to be ashamed of your skin color. But being that proud of being white means you tacitly acknowledge what the benefits of whiteness have cost people of color for 500 years. 

One last thing, this whole idea of race being contentious or cause for pride was a political act by plantation farmers and Southern gentry to prevent two things: Americans running away to live with Native tribes, and poor whites and poor blacks from making common cause against them and redistributing power and land.

It's a somewhat loosely debated topic what happens when your under, and whether it's a memory loss (and like paralysis), true pain blockage, ect. But there are strong cases for what you were saying, that it is a total pain blocker since the symptoms associated with feeling pain aren't present (increased breathing, increased heart rate, ect)

"On the herbicide pesticide side of things: (from the same article)

&gt;While significant reductions in pesticide costs are observed for both HT and IR crops, only IR crops cause a consistent reduction in pesticide quantity. Such disparities are expected, because the two technologies are quite different. IR crops protect themselves against certain insect pests, so that spraying can be reduced. HT crops, on the other hand, are not protected against pests but against a broad-spectrum chemical herbicide (mostly glyphosate), use of which facilitates weed control. While HT crops have reduced herbicide quantity in some situations, they have contributed to increases in the use of broad-spectrum herbicides elsewhere

(edit)
on the yield side:
&gt;On average, GM technology has increased crop yields by 21% (Figure 2). These yield increases are not due to higher genetic yield potential, but to more effective pest control and thus lower crop damage [27].

shortcuts can make for misconceptions on what the reader thinks he is reading. 

So, the plants they talk about here does not produce bigger fruits, only has less problems with yield decreasing factors such as weeds and insects."

"&gt;  but it happens

over and over.  about everything.

Things I've had that went undiagnosed/untreated/screwed up by a doctor:

-a staph infection that needed antibiotics, the kind I was prescribed were the wrong kind because a panel was never done to see which one I needed, and almost cost my entire foot instead of a toenail and some bones in my foot

-i went to a doctor and said ""I have a middle ear infection and it's draining, i need something for the pain"" and I was told ""You have media otitis with effusion"". The asshole literally just parroted what I said in latin and charged me my last dollar.  I was a dumb kid.

-I was offered an MRI to scan for brain trauma by a doctor who told me ""these things happen sometimes"" when I was all mentally jacked up.  Turned out to be anemia, purple fingernails and everything, a bottle of b-complex fixed it in literally a day.

-I have a daughter who hit 5 years old before her allergies were identified because I paid out of pocket and told the doctor what to run panels for and his nurse turned it into the magical code that the hospital lab would run panels for.  Up to that point, we had almost half a dozen doctors tell us everything from ""she needs to get vaccinated"" to ""if you just fed her what she's allergic to, she'll be sick for a few weeks and then her body will adjust"" to ""this is because you kept her too clean and don't feed her enough variety"".   Turns out, all that advice literally would have killed her.  Great job, doctors!

-My wife was on 3 different asthma drugs her whole preteen and teen years, and as soon as she moved out of a house with her mom chain smoking in it, the ""asthma"" went away, after she was weaned off her meds

-I have had a doctor check my blood pressure every time I've been looked at, just like everyone else.  A year ago, I was trying to figure out why I had a headache for the last year or two almost every day, and found out my blood pressure is very abnormally high.  I am on track to die when I'm 55, and there's just about nothing I can change lifestyle wise to fix it.  How have I gone the past decade and nobody fucking noticed that it's not normal for a 25 year old to pull a 155/94 sitting in the waiting room for an ingrown toenail?

These are the ones I can remember off the top of my head.  I have no stories to the contrary.  I've had some doctors do well treating things, like a good root canal one time and a good job stitching together a finger I put in a table saw.  Not exactly diagnosis.

I am sure there are doctors who read journals, keep up with their field, attend seminars to continue learning, and like to try to get the right answer.  I've never met one."

"Interstellar.

First 1/3 of the movie you get to know the protagonist's family (btw. the only one acting good in this movie is Murphy - Cooper's daughter). And then, you do not see her anymore for like 4000years (that movie is that long, right?). 

Anyway, you seem to even forget that there is life on earth in between the landing on the planets. Losing one trash character after another. And then there's Matt Damon. Why him? Why did he do, what he did. He betray's his friends and **poof**.

Then, there is the only good thing in this movie, their try on replicating a room in the 4th dimension is quite nice to look at.

Afterwards there is the travelling space ship where earth citizens live - the end.

"Let's think about this for a minute.

During your lifetime, you will incur $(x) amount of health care costs. Insurance companies hire actuaries to figure this stuff out, what the average HC cost per person per lifetime is.

The way we do health care today is very sporadic. We wait until there is an actual health care event in your life to start paying for it. And then it's outrageously expensive.

Knowing that your life will most definitely incur a certain amount of HC costs, wouldn't it make sense to amortize that cost over your entire lifetime? It would certainly be a lot more manageable.

Obamacare tries to do that in the free market, but you still have the problem of companies needing to always make profits, even during downturns. That's why for-profit insurance companies leave the ACA exchanges.

Government is best able to handle lifetime healthcare, because it can weather downturns without sacrificing quality of care."

All I said is that sugar is not good for you regardless of where it comes from. This whole thing started because I said eating an orange is a better alternative to just drinking straight up juice (sugar water).

No shit adding sugar to food is not a good idea. This is because if you eat a well rounded diet, adding additional sugar to it would exceed the recommended amount. Your dumb ass said eating several servings of fruit a day was not bad for you. Then you link the FDA who puts an upper limit on the amount of sugar you can eat regardless of where it comes from. Eating several servings of fruit would exceed the recommended limit.

&gt; Don't depict an orange as the lesser of two evils.

"This is a statement by a person living in constant fear of the unknown, who secretly yearns for a life with a written and clear meaning.

We have freedom of choice in these matters as they are entirely personal, even a slave has these despite being controlled physically in the world, their mind is still their own even if it isn't given form in words. 

However when one has true freedom as many more enjoy in today's world, this becomes intimidating due to the seemingly infinite choices of ways to live life, and ways to interpret it through thousands of philosophies and religions. Some adopt a world view of fear as in your statement, I personally find one of optimism and appreciate that I can make of life what I will. Being right isn't important, it's that it is yours. No one is truly correct with regards to answers to these questions, therefore there should be no fear of failure. Just do the best you can in your life, that's all we have. 

TL;DR - There is no single meaning, no single purpose, and no single value in life. We make our own, and no answer will be truly correct, and whatever higher powers that be have allowed it to be this way meant for us to determine our own fates. This is what it means to be an intelligent life form."

"I'm sorry but, for the love of god, stop trying to promote these kinds of charities, they continuously do more harm than good and are responsible for the continued existence and suffering of the endless starving victims in poverty.

Feeding these people doesn't contribute to solving the problem at all, it contributes to stalling it for a bit, and in the process, makes it much worse. By receiving handouts these countries not only grow more dependent, but allows them to keep breeding and having even more innocent children which then have to suffer even more because their nations are never going to develop properly. They have become the equivalent of human pets, where the majority of them will suffer a slow painful death from starvation, and this will keep happening because of rich people who want to feel good about themselves and the starving families in poverty who just continue having 12 kids each.

  Does anybody layment Genghis Khan's killing of millions? Even today the sheer numbers of dead killed by the Mongol horde is unrivaled. They eradicated entire cultures. On the fringes of their empire, in Eastern Europe traces of their conquest are still there. Hungarians Bulgarians and Turks speak languages related to those from Central Asia. One of the greatest libraries in the world, in Baghdad, was completely burned. The ink of its books were said to turn the Euphrates black.  
  
  
  
  Does anyone lament the Islamic conquest of the Near/Middle East and North Africa? Their conquest of South-Eastern Europe? The destruction of native cultures, the forced conversion to religion to the point where all of these lands at one point were thought of as Arab? I only say 'were' because Southeastern Europe is not no longer thought of as Arab. But the rest of these lands absolutely are with the possible exception of Turkey and Iran. It's still going on today. Look at videos of Isis smashing statues as they attempt to completely erase 5,000 plus years of human history and re-write the culture.  
  
  
  
  Speaking of modern atrocities, I wonder if you can be bothered to speak of the horrible things being done in these countries, and many others, to this day? Or do you just feel it necessary to harp on the horrible misdeeds of white people only because it's fashionable and safe to do so?

"&gt;My girlfriend can come from penetration alone and I have several dildos and a harness for that purpose. But she wants it maybe 1 out of 5 times we have sex. She's bisexual and had dated mostly men until me, and she said if she were with a man shed basically have to have penetration more often even if she was horny but didnt want a dicking that day because all of that other stuff ""doesn't count"" to men.

Unless ""other stuff"" included oral, sounds to me that they wanted to ignore the dick. 

&gt;it starts when it's hard and ends when it ejaculates.

This is why people say that the woman needs to get off first. It's because plenty (if not most) men come once, and their mood is over. That's the trade-off for having easier-to-get-to orgasms. For woman, it's different. Sex doesn't start with penetration, but for plenty of men, if they already got their partner off, it ends with ejaculation."

"&gt; Depends on how you define violent crime.

I'm going off the FBI/DoJ definition

&gt; but women make a significant majority of rape victims

this is much less true than you'd think. if you include ""made to penetrate"" in rape stats (which most places don't), it snaps to near symmetry. 

also worth keeping in mind that we're talking about ""Walking home alone at night"". the overwhelming majority of sexual crimes, especially rape, are committed by people known to the victim. not people accosting them in the street. 

&gt; Plus a lot of on-male violence is gang issues or cartel activity.

i don't think someone shot by a gang banger is somehow less valuable because of it. but even if you take the most liberal estimates on gang violence and exclude them, men still vastly outnumbers women in the body count. 

&gt;  Fear is definitely not the answer, but pretending that there's nothing to fear isn't either.

not *nothing*, but nothing more severe than what men live with.

&gt;  The solution lies mostly in education and strengthening of the justice system.

yes, but that's true for everything always forever. it's not actionable at a personal level. anyone reading this post has a much greater ability to teach their daughter not to quail at every bump in the night than to reform the entire justice system."

"&gt; part of shared household means making sure that things are liveable

the only difference is the definition of 'livable' and I bet your definition is much narrower than your (male) partners.

I always find it interesting that this isn't seen as both sides compromising but instead one person has the 'correct' version of how things should be and the other person's opinion is 'wrong' so it's not *really* a compromise, it's one person who's wrong *learning how to be less wrong*."

"&gt; When I say the housework expectation fell to me it was more of a broader statement on the emotional labor of keeping a household running. They did housework and chores for the most part. But it often fell to me to organize that work. For example if friends were staying over I was the one who would have to remind them the laundry had to be done before they arrived so clean sheets would be available. It's a small thing. But it was hundreds of small things daily/weekly/monthly. They were willing to do housework but I had to tell them to do it first or they would ""forget"".

To be fair, most women will expect men to do the heavy lifting. I'm perfectly fine with that, but then they shouldn't get frustrated if she has to do a lot of ""small things"". I think that both parties should contribute to the household, but the household isn't limited to laundry or cleaning. I've lived on my own for years, so I have no issues doing basic housework. It just has to be fair.

You are right to say that there are some traditions at work here, but that's not all there is to it. From my personal experience, it just feels natural for men to focus on the doing tasks that require more power while women focus on other tasks. Like, for example, I'll scrub the floor real good and she'll clean the tiny annoying things that I'll just drop on the floor. Teamwork, but each playing to their strengths."

My best guy friend James is a total dork. He told me a story about how he accidentally locked himself outside in his own backyard a few weeks ago.

...naked hehehe.

He said he had a towel on and was checking the backdoor for some stupid videogame he had shipped to him, tripped, lost the towel and locked himself outdoors totally buck naked.

Just imagining him out there...his slightly chubby belly, that bubble butt he's hiding under his nerdy khaki pants, and that little penis flapping in the sunshine.

Oh my God what I wouldn't give to witness that virgin boy naked and helpless out there. Fucking hilarious!!! lol

"NSFW

Now, Snape is ready to cum. He grabs his penis and fell the throobing coming…and them…the cum-tastic delight goes out of his powerful snake hose and fills Laa-Laa’s small vagina with a gorgeous and thunderstriking goo that overflows her and wash the last pureness that yellow and sexy body had one day.

She cums too, and now, she is a complete fl, a yelow and tasty alien woman girl with nice and softly cotton breasts. Her Telletubbie body got gorugeously tasty an even her brothers think she is delicious now that she have breasts.

Dipsy cums inside Tinky Winky too, and the two cotton alien boys now discover what it takes to make a real action hero.

“Boys” said Snape “you have graduated. You now are full fledged mature and responsible adults. You can take care of your own butts and do with it all you deserve.”

Poo was a little sad, but she know her time will come.

“Snape” said Tinky Winky rubbing his cum covered and hurting ass “We must escape, the perischope woman is already searching for us, because we haven’t returned to sleep.”

“Okay Tinky-Winky, you lead the way” and the Telletubbies and Snape followeed Tinky-Winky’s down the hole they excavated. The cave was very dark and long, but Snape used his wand to iluminate the way.

As they walked, down the cave, a light at the end of the tunnel was near, and they raced towards it. But someone was expecting them. A figure was facing the cave, with his back turned against the light out of the tunnel.

“You shall not pass.” said the voice

“Who are you?” askjed Snape

“I’m very disappointed with you Snape. I thought you had a rocky shadow heart. But it seems I’m wrong. It was a mistake sending you here to placate these little rainbow bastards. A mistake I’m going to correct.”

“Wait, I know that voice…it’s-” and them, the figure emerges from the light, create a flowing flame around him, and his face is revealed. It’s Dumbledore!

“No! You!” shouted Snpae.

“Yes, me!”

“Why do you want with the Telletubbies?”

“Oh, you don’t know? They are Death Eaters Snape! We must kill them!”

“Death Eaters? That’s impossible!”

“No…” said Tinky-Winky “it’s true. We worked to Voldermot.”

Snape got awed:

“No…why?”

“Voldermort promissed that he would free our homeland from the dementors horde invasion. But, as we worked for him and infiltrated inside the Hogwarts, Dumbledore caught us. Now he absorbs our energies to fuel his mecha-bulldozer that-”

“Shut the fuck up!” cried Dumbledore. “You now will die!”

“No, I will not permit!” said Snape. He created a strong bound with those aliens, and he can’t let them die, even if they are working for the enemy.

“So” said Dumbledor “you will die too!” and Dumbledore invoke the killing speel from his wand. But them, Yinky-Winky, from the bottom of his purse, pulled out a Colt 45 Revolver and shoot Dumbledore, but the wizard deflected the bullet.

“HA, you cannot kill me!”

“Snape, go, save the Telletubbies, I’ll buy you time!” cried Tikny-Winky.

“No!” shout Laa-Laa “we can’t let you die here!”

“But you must, our he will kill us all and no one will can save our homeland!” and the Tinky-Winky advanced in the Dumbledore’s direction shooting rapid bullets at him.

Snape used his wand and started to drill a hole in the cave, circumventing the vicious battle happening near the entrance. Snape and the Telletubbies managed to drill another hole out some feet awya from the confrontation and gotout of the cave. They raced away from it, and at some distance, they saw Tinky-Winky shooting Dumbledore:

“Dubledor!” cried Tinky-Wink. He picked a hand grenade, pulled the pin, threw it at Dumbledore and shout “Die BASTAAAAAAAARD!”

“NOOOOOOOOOO!” and the cave exploded, lauching debris all over the place.

“Fast Telletubbies,” said Snape “HIDE!” and they did. A lot of rock felt from the sky and fumes and dust covered everywhere.

“Tinky-Winkyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!” cried the three Telletubbies, and Laa-Laa tried to run and find her purple brother, but Snape prevented:

“No, you can’t! This place is unstable, we will die staying here!” cried Snape and the earth started to shake. They raced away from the crumbling Tubbydrome Supertronic, avoinding the falling rocks and the posion flower that attacked them.

After a while, they reached a safe haven.

Laa-Laa was very sad and crying much:

“Why? Why we let him die Snape?”

“Oh Laa-Laa, he saved us and was his desire that we escaped.”

“But it is not fair…”

“I know…I know” and Snape hugged Laa-Laa, and the other Telletubbies did it too.

Now, these four heroes must find a way to save the Telletubbie planet from the horde of dementors that are trying to invade and conquer the place, slaving all of the millions of telletubbie inhabitants. Who is behind all this? Is Voldermort involved? And Snape and Laa-Laa? Will they be together till the end?

Snape says:

“Laa-Laa, I promisse, we will avenge your brother…”

The End?

If the man wants it and the woman doesn't, then the woman can either get paid for her labor at a rate she chooses or the abortion will occur.  If the first occurs, then the woman is not forced to pay child support and must give up her parental rights and be allowed no contact for 18 years."

"This will likely get buried, but here we go.

Sperm count on men has dropped nearly 70% past 40-50 years in Western countries. Officially the reason is: we don't know what is causing it.

To get this rapid effect within 1-2 generations, an external stimuli (non-genetic) HAS to be the reason. Unless we live in a Matrix, that is...

Now, we feel ""safe"" within our normal consumerism, yet it's VERY likely that something in our lifestyle that is related to products we use, is causing this.

My guess is plastics and there is quite a lot of studies to backup the claim to an extent. Many, many plastics act as hormone inhibitors, causing severe changes in our bodies.

In theory, non-ionic radiation, could cause changes that we are completely unaware of.

Other guess could be commonly used pesticides or herbacides called neonicotinoids, but that's unlikely since those are relatively new, yet causing issues to eg. pollenating bees.

Whatever the case, this drop in sperm count is alarming and only present in the rich, Western world. It's causing infertility already.

Over every tenth child in Denmark is already assisted with services from fertility clinics.

"I didn't randomly choose a study, I looked at the study you linked.  It's very hard to definitively prove much with regards to psychology.  I also didn't say that it caused schizophrenia, just that it may cause earlier onset of symptoms.

(“While cannabis may have an effect on the age of onset of schizophrenia it is unlikely to be the cause of illness,” said the researchers, who were led by Ashley C. Proal from Harvard Medical School.

“In general, we found a tendency for depression and bipolar disorder to be increased in the relatives of cannabis users in both the patient and control samples. This might suggest that cannabis users are more prone to affective disorders than their non-using samples or vice versa.” Future research is needed to understand this relationship.)

From your linked article on a study.


Also a proven correlation of something causing something would be a causation.  

As a quote from you: ""So the only thing in the world that can increase one's risk of getting schizophrenia is the fact that they have a familial risk."".

Schizophrenia isn't purely genetic as monozygotic twin pairs who are genetically identically don't always both have or not have it slightly above 40% according to data gathered from the Maudsley twin register.  This means that there are other factors.  It may be that a genetic predisposition is required, HOWEVER it means that these people without encountering these factors which may include marijuana may never get schizophrenia. "

"So let's say a community is addicted to crack cocaine. The solution is then to bring in ecstasy, a slightly less harmful drug, so that less people will smoke crack and more people will do the less harmful drug?

No.  Society as a whole actually benefits from a system of roads, it's not just redistributing wealth to other people.

"Since gluttony is sin, which of the Ten Commandments does it break?
There are some who, in prayer and other acts of religion, are always in search of pleasure for their senses. They try to feel and taste God on a physical level, as if He were tangibly accessible to them in their acts of devotion. Their false faith comes from the enjoyment of seeing, touching, smelling, hearing or tasting their personally created god that comes in such forms as traditional liturgies, images, incense, music and sometimes food.
Paul writes in Philippians 3:18-19 that gluttons tend to concentrate on physical things, neglecting their spiritual relationship with God:
For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame—who set their mind on earthly things.
We may think such idolatry is rare among us, but the apostle says there are ""many . . . whose god is their belly,"" their appetites, their physical senses. They break the first commandment, ""You shall have no other gods before me,"" because their desire becomes a higher priority than their Creator and Sustainer. Gluttony breaks the rest of the commandments as well:
The second, when we serve or relinquish control to our physical desires. Colossians 3:5 says, ""Therefore put to death your members which are on earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry."" We ""bow down"" to a false god when we gratify our lusts of the flesh and of the eyes (I John 2:16).
The third, when we fail to uphold God's name—and all that it represents—in glory and honor. Many call themselves Christians and claim to follow Christ, but lack the holy character God wants us to have (I Peter 2:5, 9). Is ""Glutton"" the name God wants His holy people to have? I Peter 1:15 answers, ""He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct.""
The fourth, when we use the Sabbath, a feast day, to crave and overeat. Sometimes we do this under the assumption that, since we are fellowshipping, we can eat excessive amounts. Eating or drinking too much is seeking our own pleasure, which Isaiah 58:13-14 warns against in the context of the Sabbath:
If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on My holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy day of the LORD honorable, and shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words, then you shall delight yourself in the LORD. . . .
The fifth, when we do not wisely use the many years of support and training we received from our parents. A child of any age who does not have self-control is a worry and an embarrassment to his parents. The glutton, abusing his body with excessive food, may not live even as long as his parents, fulfilling the inverse of the commandment's promise.
The sixth, by systematically and continually destroying the body and mind that God has given into our care. It is slow suicide. If parents are gluttons, they teach their children to do the same, thereby eventually killing them as well. ""We are facing a real epidemic of obesity,"" said Dr. Jeffery Koplan, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""All segments of the population are getting fatter, but the highest increase is among the youngest ages. . . . There is no worse harbinger of what is to come."" Since our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit (I Corinthians 6:19), to destroy it knowingly is sin.
The seventh, when we over-eat, over-buy, over-accumulate as a ""get"" way of life. Our way of life is our religion, and if it is a lifestyle of excessive desire, our religion is in competition with God's way of life. This, in effect, is spiritual adultery, as seen in Jeremiah 3:6-10. God says in verse 9, ""So it came to pass, through [Judah's] casual harlotry, that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and trees."" These idols, worshiped on the high places, became the object of Judah's excessive desire, just as food, drink or any material thing can be.
The eighth, when we take more than what is balanced and needful, thus more than God has given. In addition, by hoarding for ourselves we steal from others. Certainly, when there are people without enough, for us to consume more than we need is wrong (Proverbs 22:9; 11:24-26). A society that over-consumes at the expense of others is, at the very least, greedy. Wastefulness is a by-product of gluttony, and Americans no longer live by sayings like, ""Waste not, want not!"" We live in a careless, throw-away society, but the day will come when this gluttonous nation will lose everything and be taken into captivity. Proverbs 23:21 predicts, ""For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty.""
The ninth, when we are gluttonous while calling ourselves Christians. This is a lie and hypocritical, misrepresenting God. Commonly, gluttons blame a thyroid problem or claim it is a disease, thereby relinquishing responsibility. If this is not true, it is a lie. It is also a lie if we think that giving into excessive desire will not hurt us. God speaks of such self-deception in Jeremiah 7:8-10:
Behold, you trust in lying words that cannot profit. Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom you do not know, and then come and stand before Me in this house which is called by My name, and say, ""We are delivered to do all these abominations""?
The tenth, when we are not satisfied with what we have and desire the possessions of others. A glutton wants even more than he has. Children must be taught not to want the biggest piece of cake or the most ice cream. Solomon had one wife, then he wanted another and another and another until he had hundreds. Solomon was a glutton, which his power and wealth made easier.
As James says, if we break one commandment, we break them all (James 2:10). With gluttony, we can specifically break each one."

"We British did horrible things in the past but we realised what we did was wrong and looked at ways to make it better. We gave back land and independence, paid an enormous sum of money to these countries to help them get on their feet. Helped train their governmental services and public services such as police, fire and ambulance. Helped get their healthcare system up and running. Offered unconditional citizenship to anyone who was born in a state which was subjected to colonisation. 

Whilst what we did was wrong we recognised it. With the atrocities that America took part in, alot of Americans seem to just want to put their fingers in the ears and pretend it didn't happen or that they had some ""right"" to do it. America is a nation built on colonialism, terror and subjugation. Whilst it doesn't have to be a defining characteristic of the country, they should at least realise that it happened and do things to pay back to those people a little bit. Tearing down statues is just another way to erase this history. "
"What people ignore is that they take the easy way out... that's not inherent to Aborigines, its inherent to US ALL.

Its the reason why some Aborigine leaders themselves have said the 'dole', Government handouts are holding them back.   Why make an effort if you can lay and be looked after."

This is strongly linked to the methods that men use. [This book](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W5WHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) cites two studies showing women use less lethal methods such as self-poisoning or jumping, whilst men use more lethal methods such as firearms or hanging. The [same book cites a 2008 study in China](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W5WHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), where the rate of suicide is at least equal (or higher for women in rural areas); this is because the methods of suicide are not divided along gender lines.  

This isn't to say that male suicide isn't a problem, or should be viewed as less of a problem than female suicide.

"'We know our limitations'

Do we though? We know some of our limitations (we cannot fly unaided, we cannot travel faster than the speed of light, we cannot see infra red with our eyes, etc.), but we don't know all of our limitations, because we might not be able to comprehend what those limitations are.

Let's use my cat example again, the cat might have some pretty good theories on what the TV is. It might be able to think it's some kind of toy for humans, or that we need it to live, or (most likely) that it's a cool, warm box that lights up sometimes. 

But it could never understand what the TV actually is, no matter how much time or how many cat resources it used. 

I'm just speculating that the same might be true for us, and that we cannot know our limitations, because we might think we have the right answer, but are actually miles off the mark because we could never understand it.  "
It probably is widely believed as the most common reason though.  I have heard more than one argument that we need to just build free public housing for homeless people and/or let them live rent free in foreclosed houses and the problem will be solved.

"I guess it's not theft. It still seems deceitful to me and it's not like they 'deserved it', theyre probably just lonely. Have I misunderstood that you offered these pictures in exchange for them giving their money away?

I understand theft is too strong a word but I retain that something is off about not giving people the thing which you used (by way of a promise) to incentivise their giving money away (even if not to you yourself).

If I'm wrong, as downvotes indicate, please explain it to me. Maybe I'm taking it too seriously - although at least to me $25 is a lot of money."
"It's unfortunate that prison is a business in America. I think that might have something to do with sentencing seeing as corporate America has quite some influence on politics.

It really isn't like that here in Denmark and I am certain that the rehabilitation is much better here. That being said a lot of the sentencing here is way too low. I guess that's a money issue here too seeing as the government pays for the prisons. What can you do ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

"You realize someone has to report news, right? Demonizing all media is not particularly intelligent. It's Trump's own fault he attacked the media, and continues to do so. It's an incredibly stupid move for a public figure. And while this may not be the end of the world, having an ineffective, regressive president can do a ton of damage. Based on the last 8 months, this president is horrible. To be fair though it isn't just him. It's his administration. And various congressmen/women.

And it may be time to stop referring to those that don't agree with you as goons. Or libtards. Or whatever. That only makes the issue worse."

"""laundry and remember birthdays/pick up cards/ make the shopping list""

Unimportant was a misuse on my part. More like after thoughts. Things that go on the back burner ""Ill get to it when ever"".

I feel like women tend to be cognizant of their partners day to day well being more, not just ""oh I really think laundry is important in my life"" - Agreed, but no one is forcing you to be that way. If you don't want to be a care taker, then don't. It's simple. The trick is if he isn't up to your standards, find a new one. Don't keep doing these things for him and complaining about it. Just my own experience (that's my disclaimer I'm not making any scientific statements here) but generally men and women just have different levels of comfortability in living conditions. I'll wear a pair of jeans twice and not worry about it. Ill go shopping after I've eaten everything in the house. And I would rather send a text message than buy a birthday card or I'll offer to take someone to dinner.

"You need to educate yourself. Oppression has occurred to all kinds of people in the history of the world. And in the history of the world, the 'oppression' that both females and males face in the West is nothing compared to instances like the entire Jewish race being sold into slavery, or entire genocides.  

I believe you should be ashamed for comparing sexism that happen to both genders about different things about things like slavery, genocide, inquisition, and other different forms of true oppression. Just as much as we need to end things like racism, this madness of victimizing your own person needs to end now, before you defile morality even further than it already has been by right wing people with your sheer insanity. Both right wing and leftist ideas are too far gone now."

One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy any more. ... That will change immediately if global emission rights are distributed. If this happens, on a per capita basis, then Africa will be the big winner, and huge amounts of money will flow there.""

There are some interesting articles written by porn stars and others in the industry that demonstrate how badly the industry treats the women - and men - who take part in the films. It's a poor decision to start with and often girls go expecting to be starring in a film where one girl and one man have sex, only to find halfway through, two other guys join in and suddenly she's having to do stuff she never thought of, or she won't get paid.

And how do you know the girl you're watching is doing it consensually?

And who fooled her into it, telling her she was going to work in a bar to make money for her family who are desperately struggling back home.

When the other person finds that someone else the truth is out. You are forced to deal with it internally. Often the friendship suffers the same fate as it would have if you had said something, with the exception that it could never become more.

You miss out on the chance for something great happening because you fear the alternative.

Friends come and go, when you're 20 it feels like you will be friends forever. When you're 40 you look back fondly on all the friends you had that had since drifted away through circumstance or unfortunate events."

"And that is what I meant by common sense. The actual law enforcement should have a little tact itself (and to be fair, it often does). As much as laws try to he as objective as possible, they're enforced by human beings. 

For proof that system works, notice that the first amendment protects most free speech, but not all. Threatening someone IS a crime. Going up to someone and saying you'll kill them is in itself a crime. Saying you have a bomb and intend blowing up a building with it is in itself a crime whether you end up doing it or not. You can grab this and find example like yours but in practice they just don't happen. Because the law enforcement fortunately often has enough common sense to avoid those cases. 

Saying ""I swear one of these days I'm gonna end up punching that guy"" isn't going to get you in any trouble. Sure, laws are abusable, but in this case I think it's better to have the law than not.

After all, if making abortion flat out illegal doesn't reduce the number of abortions, then surely making abortions slightly harder to get has no effect on the amount of women who have access to abortions."

"Another reddit said we are consuming more water and less soda. So we’re killing the soda industry. But I think we are killing the sugar industry as a whole. Can you imagine a whole generation used to wake up in the morning and eat sugar for breakfast?

Things I can’t wait to see die are tv, cars, diamonds, magazine, usps, and credit cards.

Tv - man is it atrocious. I haven’t watch tv since high school. Sometimes I’m over at my in law home and i channel flip and the craps they have are unbearable. Most channels are just talking heads with nothing better to do but dissect every little thing. Watch CNN and they have a panel for everything and all these people supposedly represent some demographic? ESPN is even worse. It just Sports, a bunch of grown men playing a game. Do we need to put on our serious face and debate who’s the goat? That’s internet banter, but seeing live people sitting with suits on doing that is something else.

Cars - I can’t wait for the day I can hail a self driving Uber at my doorstep then drop me off at my destination. No car expenses, no parking, no awkward human interaction. It will be glorious.

Diamonds - again a whole generation used to value these rocks and spent a whole month salary on them? Geez, it just shiny rocks. There are plenty of shiny rocks. De Beer must be shitting in their pants.

Magazine - at this point magazine are just printed Internet that kills trees.

Usps - I’m going to remove my mailbox. Nothing in the mail but ads and scam offers. Everything important would already have my email.

Credit card - stop falling into the trap of using money you don’t have and stop giving too much power to these credit rating companies. Private companies shouldn’t be able to collect info about individuals and then sell it to other companies to report how trustworthy you are at paying bills."

You CAN make a living without a specialization or degree, but it is not as easy as taking the first job you get and expecting it to pan out.

"I think that I am weirdly unique. I look like I am into all kind of things sexually, both identity and orientation, and I totally totally AM!

I only dated girls and had sex with them but in last half of year my libido for some unknown reason went crazy. Maybe it has to do with my looks, I am quite skinny but not without some muscle tone, my face is in a girlish way good looking, so I think I could be attractive to both genders.

I am really into, with consent, sexually dominating girls, but I am also totally into them doing the same to me, but I also would like to try guys sexually dominating (errm obliterating me) in the same way I can dominate a girl. and I also want to dominate some guy shorter than me, androgynous and hairless. I also want to get cuckolded, just looking how musular guys owns pussy of some girl I have known as a friend for years and then lets me eat out massive creampie(s?) is probably the hottest fantasy to me. Yet I also masturbate on thoughts of making some girl who has arrogant rich boyfriend cheat on with me. Just a fantasy tho.

I could easily look like a twink, but not with feminine or genderqueer overtones. The only problem is that I still really want a happy relationship or dating abilities with girls and the other problem is that I am 6'1 and 152 pounds wich is a bit too much for a submisive sexually but I could be skinnier.

I have much free time on college and could do this if I finally start, I would like to also dress as some form of alt-boy with ear plugs and piercings (on my tight  belly hah). I am just overthinking much. "

Racial Characteristics: 

Pie-faced, neckless, bandy-legged sots who almost never fuck. Ignorant and superstitious, they are in utter thrall to the vile, conniving priests of their dark and barbarous religion.

The principal delights of the Irish are in quarreling and fighting and killing each other with bombs. They can be trained to do nothing useful that a dray horse can't accomplish in half the time, and they spew out a continuous stream of mumbles and grunts which they fancy to be ""poems.""

You just got triggered by words on the internet, and you are trying to suggest that I'm feeling incredibly on edge. Then to proceed to reveal that you care waaaaaaaaay too much about the internet. Not only the personal attack, after I've said nothing rude or disrespectful to you what so ever. ""cunt"" but actually the fact that you suggest being downvoted on the internet would effect my mood, obviously because it effects yours.

Well, that kind of makes you a fucking idiot right? Because you didn't ask that at all, and then after this sentence you proceed to whine and cry and talk shit to me for no reason? So if that was the plan, why didn't you ask that in the first place, instead of just asking for a link, are you stupid? And second of all, if that was the plan here, maybe not talking a bunch of shit like a triggered weeaboo would be a better way to understand my argument?

My argument was the fact that all mental illness is not genetic. I never said it can or cannot be, I said that it can be both.

&gt; And how do you believe that a random reddit user is an expert on psychology? Aren't people here clowns?

Where did I say anyone was an expert on psychology?

Where did I say people here are clowns?

I used to do it. I didn't spar with people; it was purely for exercise. But also, you're right: If I was going up against some gigantic thug, it would be stupid. I'd kick him five times, and then he'd look at me and kill me.""

"I would say that's stretching the definition of the fallacy fairly thin. Feminism is about improving the societal options for women. It's not about destroying men and hurting them. 

I've been in an abusive relationship. I was hit more than once. I was shoved and almost cracked my head open on a porcelain window-sill, which may very well have done serious damage in any number of ways. I've had knives pulled on me more times than I can count. I had a shoe thrown at me. I've been bitten, scratched and out-right punched in the face. 

I was constantly accused of cheating. I was verbally abused. I walked on pins and needles and suffered through many alcohol induced black-out drunk evenings where I was the only one to remember the arguments from the night before. I was no saint by any means, and I certainly didn't help the arguing. And I understand that, if police had been called, there's a high likelihood that it would have been me to have been arrested regardless of the actual person at fault or perpetuating violence. 

But just because men suffer injustices does not make feminism inherently evil. Both genders suffer different, and in some cases heinous tribulations. I will not call feminism and a movement intended to reduce suffering evil simply because I've suffered personally."
"That's largely due to the way men and women generally display aggression with each other. Men tend to be physically aggressive with regard to peer group dominance, whereas women tend to display social aggression. Social aggression is the practice of insult, ostracism, and rumour mongering among peers for the purpose of gaining or maintaining social dominance. It is a skill that girls develop quite early. Boys start to develop the skill in adolescence, but girls have a huge head start by that point.

That is why when men ""roast"" their friends, it is not immediately seen as a method of seeking dominance. Only after repeated and frequent occurances, will you see defensive posturing start to occur."

"The more sex a person has the more desensitized they become to sex.

For men this means they last longer, which is good because this gives them more time to please a woman before they orgasm and can no longer maintain an erection.

For women this is usually bad because this means it takes longer for men to please them, and men by large margins orgasm faster than women. And once a man orgasms he loses one method of bringing a woman to orgasm, along with losing sex drive during his recovery period."

However, the first place my mind goes when I see a male or female who didn't make a conscious effort is that they don't care about their image and, similarly, other people's opinion of them.


As a straight male, an ""ugly girl"" who has clearly put a ton of effort into her makeup is far more attractive than a ""pretty girl"" who has not put in as much effort, because the ""ugly girl"" has demonstrated she values my opinion more than the ""pretty girl"" by putting in more effort.

"So why can't you just say intellectually disabled, or mentally disabled. Obviously people are unaware and/ or inconsiderate of how people with disabilities feel about being labeled as ""retarded"", when there are plenty of other nicer, more natural ways to describe them. You don't refer to a black person as the n word do you? After all they're black? You don't call a Mexican person any derogatory names do you? No, you refer to them in the most natural way possible.

People were getting stabbed and run over and shot before refugees came. Most of our mass shootings in America are by Americans with easy access to guns. 

One of the biggest gifts given to me is having grown up in NYC. We have people from all over the world fleeing war, poverty or simply wanting a better life. 98% just want what you and I want - family and a job. 2% of EVERY group has criminal elements. It's more an issue of human nature than being ethnically inferior. In NYC we have Russian and Italian mafia, Latino and Chinese gangs, Irish Mob. Do they speak for the whole? Growing up in Brooklyn Italian mafia was a big deal. Most Italians were good, hard-working people. A small group of them were killers and criminals. Does that make ALL Italians bad? You'd be ignorant if you said that.

The same thing you're saying is what was said about Jews fleeing persecution early 20th century and history looks back on that in disbelief. I don't want to be on the wrong side of history again. Besides it's not about political correctness, it's law. The Geneva Convention says it's our duty to take in refugees. 

I was in lower Manhattan on 9/11 and saw the towers come down with my own eyes, and I'd still gladly take in refugees. I'd prefer them as a neighbor over people who think like you. "

"First off, sorry I missed the per capita part. Second off, if you go off of the 2010 census, 2.9 million Americans identify as 100% Native American/ Aative Alaskan, and 5.2 million who identify as part Native. 

https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-10.pdf&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwh-3vhevVAhVR5mMKHRiUB88QFgglMAE&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxjJc4af3CQWIQqABrodTx4dJmtg

If only half of the full Native population was being paid $100,000 per year that would be $145,000,000,000. The U.S. national budget for 2015 was 3.8 trillion with a discretionary budget of 1.1 trillion. Your trying to tell me that over 10% of the discretionary budget is being given to native Americans, yet somehow there is widespread poverty throughout their reserves?

All of the money is given to the tribes to distribute, and most of it is for social programs. The government does not send cheques directly to an individual other than those who qualify for pensions. 

But yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't know what I'm talking about."

"I understand where both of you are coming from in this thread, albeit I think the guy you're responding to is still being more civil than a lot can be. My wife had a coworker who was transgender and every single news article about transgender was an attack on him personally.

My favourite was when Rhonda Rousey said she didn't think a transgender should be allowed in the MMA because she'd still retain male strength but compete in a female setting. From a layman's standpoint Rhonda was perfectly allowed to have that view. She didn't even present it rudely. Hoo boy did my wife's coworker lose his fucking shit over this simple comment. It doesn't breath healthy relationships if you lose your goddamn mind over a simple misunderstanding.

(And for the record on what I referenced, apparently scientifically it shows when transitioning you actually lose the male advantages but how is a random person supposed to know that?)"

"I say this all the time: the devastation of WWII in Europe created a shift away from nationalism.

However, Europe also has the benefit of being a continent of relatively concrete monocultures. While France has different regions, it is still essentially *French,* and the French Academy has protected ""Frenchness"" for hundreds of years. And while immigration to mainland Europe is changing that, it doesn't hold a candle to the US.

There is no ""culture"" in the United States, and that tends to make our sense of community much smaller -- certainly not a national level. When I hear the question ""Why doesn't the US just...?"" I know immediately that it is someone who does not understand the scope and variety of the United States. 

It's much easier to unite a generally homogenous group of people in a small country on something like nationalized healthcare, but try doing it a country ten times the population and 50-100 times the size and you start running into issues very quickly.

EDIT: If you think America is a monoculture, and that's why you're downvoting, you are ignorant."

"&gt;Once you take into account other factors such as poverty, disability, class, homelessness, sexual orientation, childhood abuse, etc you'll find that a lot of white men aren't particularly privileged but in my experience white men are usually judged on their race/sex and marginalized by certain groups irrespective of what their actual lived experiences are.

Yes, there are poor white men, some LGBT white men, etc. But you've never had to fight to have your personhood recognized solely because you are a white male. That's never been the case in this country. Not for voting rights, housing, politics, etc. There's even been periods where the entire US Govt was solely white men. That's not the case for any other demographic.

Again, no one is saying white men are free of problems in any form. There are lots of problems for the simple fact for being human. But I think we also have to realize that as minorities find themselves gaining more influence (politically, especially) that views on race/gender/whatever from white men aren't as dominating as they once were. This isn't an attack; just a fact. It used to the be the case that talking about race was quickly put down if the perspective wasn't that of a white man. It's not as if those centuries of social order just disappear overnight or because a law was passed."

Trump is president 
How will they know I'm vaping when I hold in the smoke until nothing is exhaled? 
"Left $240 cash on the table, which covered dinner for 8 of us and a good tip.  When we were all out front heading to our cars,  the manager came out looking for our money.   Somebody had stolen what was on the table, and we had to pay it a second time.    
I felt terrible because it was my father and future father-in-law who ended up splitting it twice.   The meal was meant for our families to get to know each other.   "
Last time I checked Trump didn't treat national secrets like office gossip and let militias kill American officials

"In circles where people of different races actually have productive conversations about race relations and confronting racism and prejudice there is a definition of ""Racism = Prejudice + Power.""

In our current American society there are surely non-whites who hold prejudices against white people. But there are few, if any, institutional means by which those people can have the power to impact white people in structural ways. When we say that there isn't institutional racism against white people that is what is meant."

"I feel like it's a great ending for a book but not for a movie. I feel like part of a horror movie is how someone escapes or wins, so it really subverts the expectation.

"ok those are just your friends tho. i think you underestimate how many people smoke weed and how many people live successful lives while doing it

you just speak like such a product of propaganda. as if weed is bad. if someone likes weed and it makes them happy, then its not bad for them. weed isnt a drug that ruins lives

you act like theres potential downsides? not many dude. very few. to the point where its essentially harmless"

"Or so you think. Academia-NGOs funded by George Soros are brainwashing younger generations loathe their own racial makeup (if they are white) and to sow racial division. Basically it's laughable and will only backfire by making more people woke and resistant to virulent liberalism.  The left is trying to shame toxic masculinity, and assorted buzzword labeling of white heterosexual men.  In actuality we are in the gym enjoying life, doing cool shit like golfing and drinking beer without looking things to virtue signal. "

"I don't think it's remorse, it probably felt really good to take that dump after holding it as long as he could. There is a difference between looking remorseful and being remorseful. Dogs read our faces and try to interpret and mimic as best they can. Some are better than others. 

He absolutely knows that he isn't supposed to poop in the house and that I get upset when he does. He's using his bag of tricks to let me know that he tried and to try and get a positive outcome that gets us back to treats and hugs as soon as possible. That sounds pretty fucking smart to me.

You're right in that we tend to anthropomorphize their emotions, when we have no idea what their emotions truly are. We have an interpretation of a dog's interpretation of our emotions mimicked on their face. We think. What I think you are downplaying is that although limited, this is a form of communication through which we try to understand each other."

Number one rule of all rich people throughout history is make the other guy give up his money before you give up yours. Him being from NYC (and me too) makes it all the more relevant.

Everything in them was disgusting.

"I'm sorry about your downvoting. Clearly these people have no clue what they are talking about. 

First of all people, go work a service industry job for just one week... then downvote the guy.

Not every employee is the same and therefore your experiences are never the same. His point remains valid; his expertise is far more valuable than the 20 year old who's barely been waiting tables, and doesn't even know the difference between a Cabernet or a merlot let alone the plethora of knowledge that is obtained in just WINE. Ignore the food, beer, spirits and the fact that a lot of people expect you to be a part time therapist/entertainer for the evening. 

So let's continue this argument now understanding that not every employee is equal... you are wrong yet again. No, employers will not pay him more for his service, despite how well he personally does for them. Maybe some will, most will not. That's why there are trends in the industry to staff kitchens with illegals or underpaid migrant workers and the practice of paying 2.15 an out to servers. OWNERS DO NOT WANT TO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES MORE THAN THEY HAVE TO. 

And furthermore, no, he should not have to get a different service job. He spent years training in his craft, and he's damn good at it. Why should his customers have to deal with little miss chilis waitress and not get the service they deserve. 

Just to use my analogy in bar tending... you can work at the same pub for 30 years pouring jack and cokes and opening bud lights all day... doesn't make you a skilled bartender. That person isn't comparable to the hipster mixologist who makes his own house bitters, squeezes fresh locally sourced fruit in season ,while checking and maintaining consistent PH levels of the juices and syrups used daily, and an encyclopedia of cocktails memorized with the ability to recall them instantly. I could go and on about the differences in a bartender and a mixologist. 

A school bus driver is not comparable to an army transport unit on the battlefield. One deserves more money and praise than the next. 

That being said, yeah the tipping system sucks. We have all seen that same Adam ruins everything video that you now quote to sound informed on an industry y'all clearly have no understanding of. It would be nice if skilled workers were paid more than others, but until American companies adopt more systems of profit sharing, you will have to tip your waiter/bartender. And when you get that good, knowledgeable, skilled service industry employee, please tip them appropriately. 

Remember that your $8 burger and fries combo could have costed you $15. You're $30 ribeye could have costed you $60. And that $350 bottle of wine, well it would still be $350. Because that's the standard practice. 

Restaurants are extremely hard to open and run successfully, lots of product are wasted in the process by incompetent employees and customers and they are expensive to run and maintain at a proper level. It's not a simple as your employer should pay you more and the customer should have to tip. There is a lot of working parts in this equation"

"False.  Not everyone is equal, and discrimination is useful under the right circumstances.  This example proves both of my points: pedophiles.  Pedophiles are objectively not morally equal to non-pedophiles, and as a society, we should discriminate against them."

"I might be wrong but it feels like girls do get away with it because stuff like that is usually done in a cutsey, non sexual way just to be coy and playful? Where if a guy does it it seems like he's got some ulterior motives beyond it? Obviously doesn't apply to most people, just trying to think of a reason it's a thing in the first place."

"Actually it isn't a great idea. 
I am not judging parents who do this, i can't imagine the stress you have with a baby and nobody can be or act perfect all of the time and yes before you loose your mind let your baby cry in the crib and go away for a while but it is still not the best option.

Babies cry because they need something or somebody or are hurt, you should not really stop before you don't know how to give them what they need.
I read a study that letting you baby cry is actually a horrible idea, the baby stops after a while because it goes into survival mode and wants to save energy but it is still stressed. It feels probably lost,alone and frighten, i don't think this is healthy. 

I am talking solely about babies, not grown children who through a tantrum. Babies are not manipulative, don't let them cry if there is another way."

"I found the book to be unbearable. The characters were absolute garbage and you are unfortunately reading from the husband's point of view. It might have worked better from a 3rd-person perspective, but I just found it aggravating that the husband would constantly think stuff like, ""And that was the 3rd lie I told the police..."" without the reader knowing the lie. It felt like a case of, I am reading this character's thoughts, but not all of them for plot reasons, which felt lazy as fuck. I made it about half way through the book before I got tired of the characters and then googled the ending summary."

So I look up again and I finally realize, oh shite, it's a woman! Upon this realization I lightly elbow my mate and inform him that the mythical creature known as woman has entered the store. To which he immediately turns around, stares for a couple of seconds, and then says ""Oh shit, you're right!"" Our perplexion subsides soon after and we go about our business.

"I don't know where the 10% thing came from, but I always interpreted that not as we only use 10% of our physical brain but 10% of the potential a brain our size is capable of. That percentage is probably off too or unknown (and maybe impossible since I'm not sure if you can calculate a single measurement of the capability of a brain), but i think it's plausible to be 10% or at least somewhere significantly lower than 100% for most people as we are not mostly Einstein's and Stephen Hawking's, and who knows if even they are close to having a perfectly operating brain.

Anyways, I actually enjoyed Lucy. The telekinesis and turning into a higher dimensional being thing was whatever, but the movie did get me thinking what we would be capable of if we had perfect memory, speed, ability to process many thoughts simultaneously, etc. You can't control time, but one could certainly perceive it faster to the point where it seems time is slowed down. One could mentally calculate things happening in the future to a certain extent. Maybe one can actually have heightened senses (long distance smelling/hearing/etc) by the brain being able to discern signals triggered in each of our sensors better with more acuity. There certainly were impossible things in Lucy,  but it did hit the Sci-Fi criteria of presenting a thoughtful idea, albeit some of it being unrealistic. In that way, it was more of a sci-fi movie than most other sci-fi's these days which are actually either horror films or adventure/action."

"You're projecting an awful lot here.  I didn't say anything about ""keeping it real"".  In fact quite the opposite - men are lying assholes by their ""fake insulting"".  Men generally understand that this is joking behavior and is not meant to be serious.  I assume you have seen this behavior in men have you not?  

I'll also assume you have seen women give fake compliments. They also generally know that this cannot be taken at face value. Have you not observed this as well?

So I am equal opportunity abuser - both sexes have their social flaws.  While these actions are by no means exclusive to either gender, they are generally fairly accurate, IMO.

I agree with your other points though. I somewhat understand their reaction to some of these feminist bloggers though. They (only talking about the worst of the worst here) usually will paint certain aspects as a game to be sexist when it is not just to generate controversy for revenue. (Same batch of people who create articles that over exaggerate the bad aspects of modern feminism. Thus creating a vicious cycle.) Other than that they always respond in such a toxic way that it makes the situation a million times worse. They earn the image they so desperately try to defend themselves from. "

"It's plain ignorance. Walk into a coin collector's forum and tell them you found a penny from a century ago and decided to give it a chemical bath to polish it up again and see how they react.

The fact is, there are people who are experts in this; people who have careers, hobbies, and social lives built around niches like ""antique furniture"". They have standards and best practices. They have common beliefs that are set by what the bulk of the community agrees acceptable.

You can ruin your furniture if you want to. You can even tell yourself it has more value *to you* in its ruined form than as something anyone would actually be interested in. But to the experts in the subject, to the appraisers, and basically to anyone who bothered to do five minutes of research on the subject, you've just destroyed the object's appeal and its financial worth, and you'll be lucky if someone wants to pick it up for a challenging project to restore."

You are lumping all drug users together and assuming that they all have the potential to be child abusers and even if they do take good care of and love their children, they should still get the kids taken away just like an abuser because it's better to ruin the life of a drug user who has done nothing else wrong than risk that the child might be in danger and leave them put.

Meaning you should be able to avoid it or brake in time. The driver could have been going too fast in a neighborhood and hit the dog at the last second. In which case the driver is still responsible and should fix their own car.

"&gt; Getting pretty annoyed of writing entire pages for you only to get single sentence replies, but hey, guess that's what the ideology boils down to right?

It's hardly my fault if I can express myself and my questions more succinctly than you.

-------

&gt; if the word ""thug"" was ONLY used to describe Black people

That fails on multiple counts, though. First and foremost: white people are better off than black people in the general scheme of things. Employment, risk of poverty, risk of death, almost all metrics favour white people. Saying you're ""privileged"" is literally saying that parts of your life are likely easier than someone without those privileges. Do you think it's just as bad to talk about ""rich privilege""?

&gt; Innate advantages people are born with based on skin color or other attributes (which nobody will ever talk about outside of wealth and being White).

Again, I don't think you're pulling a decent sample size. Other common privileges which are discussed regularly, at length: being able-bodied, being straight, being cisgendered, being neurotypical, being male. 

&gt; There are innate advantages and disadvantages to everything

Sure. But the majority of the advantages land in the corner of ""being born white"". 

&gt; Personally, I think women are better off than men in America by a fair amount of measurements

Personally, I'd ask you to justify this.

Simple question: would you have a problem with people talking about ""rich privilege""?"

And even just a few decades ago, it was still commonplace for women to be stay at home Moms to take care of the kids. It's only very very recently that childreering has become a two parent job.

If you really thought that man made climate change is the biggest existential threat to the world you would not be in favor of people from the lowest carbon per capita producing countries immigrating to the the highest carbon per capita producing countries. Why would anyone turn a low energy consuming person, and their future children, into high energy consuming ones?  It makes zero sense from a scientific perspective.


[Here's Michael Mann's \(The Hockey Stick guy\) prediction that the West Side Highway would be under water by now.](http://www.salon.com/2001/10/23/weather/)  He also said that restaurants would have signs in their windows that read, ""Water by request only.""

He is citing predictions that didn't happen. What do you call a theory that makes wrong predictions ?

"Personally I think it is fine for medical purposes but other than that I am against it for 3 main reasons:
#1 It is worse for you than cigarettes. But yet cigarettes are almost never seen as a good thing, and there is some push for illegalizing them. So how is weed different? A lot of people say that people don't smoke it nearly as much as cigarettes, but to be honest I think the only reason for this is because it isn't as easy to obtain. Legalize it and I gurantee it will be smoked more.
#2 It is addictive. You may say plenty of other legal things are addictive, but they don't alter your mind nearly as much as weed.
#3 Frankly, the amount of stories I have read on reddit in which someone casually mentions them smoking cars and driving weed scares me.

Although let it be known I don't think the users of the drug should be arrested, but rather the seller of it.

Edit: I have no idea why the text is so large. If anyone knows a fix please tell me

Edit: Why the downvotes? This is a post wanting reasons why weed shouldn't be legal. If you disagree with me I have no problem with this but I want to know why, this way if I am wrong about something my opinions can be changed."

"How often do you need to get some place that would be a pain if not for a car? For me its once to twice a week. That would be (generously) $40 per week for ride sharing.

But Trump is fixing it. He is an American first! He is serving us first! He didn't have to run for POTUS! He is already a billionaire! But he knows that this country is hurting and nobody is standing up for it! And despite all of the liberals mocking and attacking him, Trump defied the odds and became the savior that this country needed!

And he is already doing pretty well as POTUS! Bringing jobs back to the United States! Protecting OUR borders rather than letting potential terrorists and threats in! Saving industries that have been harmed by globalism!

"First and foremost, Trump did not mock McCain for having brain cancer. McCain was a tremendous failure for being captured. Trump doesn't like incompetent soldiers who were captured. It just so happened that McCain was later diagnosed with brain cancer. The brain cancer is irrelevant. 

Trump didn't get to where he is now by praising anybody he ever met. Trump ran numerous million-dollar businesses so he had to cut the apron strings and get rid of those people that he thought were failures. Get rid of the defective employees to make the business more successful. Being cutthroat, knowing when to cut people out, and viewing people as tools rather than humans. That's the strategy he used to become a billionaire. Of course that mindset would be present in Trump's political sphere as well. 

Also how presidential is it to mock the Special Olympics on live TV, Barack? Trump made his remark towards McCain during the campaign, where mudslinging is expecting. Obama made a distasteful joke that insulted disabled people on a comedy late night show. 

I swear, the people on this subreddit are severely liberal and only choose to attack conservatives. Let's exacerbate the Republicans's wrongdoings and completely ignore the Democrats's. "

"It wasn't a sign of oppression. The main reason the civil war was fought was over state rights. Robert E Lee wasn't pro slavery but he wasn't going to speak out against slavery when some of his higher ups were for it. Just a little history research would do this world some good. I'm not alt right or whatever people want to call it, but I am a huge fan of history. It is the truth that victors write history.  I'm not advocating the south or slavery. But we can look further back in history too. The Persians for example were made to look horrible by the victors when in fact the Persian government was quite fair for its time. They said that local governments can hold their positions and freedom of religion was established through out the empire, so long as people payed their taxes. I don't believe history should be destroyed because then it's doomed to repeat itself. Brothers fought against brothers in the Civil War and to discredit one sides bloodshed because a small percentage of that side would own slaves seems a bit drastic to me. That's just my 2 cents though."

"&gt; there are many people who have the opposite experience. for example where my friend works, the manager is very nice to, and lets men get away with everything, but the women are treated terribly.

Yea, that happens everywhere. I was referring to thing that could/should get a man fired. Treating your employees like garbage, regardless if its sexist or not isn't relevant here. You can't get fired for being mean.

I mean like, talking shit to a client that has done nothing wrong, or specifically asking a client not to schedule an appointment because there is drama in the work place, and so and so are really competitive, etc.

&gt; That's not true at all. There are lots of masculine hobbies that can get a girl labeled a lesbian, whether it's true or not.

Nope, that isn't true at all. There is no such thing as a masculine hobby that a woman can do, that'll get her labeled a lesbian. I don't know why you bother talking out your ass. A tomboy is what people assume about women who do masculine hobbies. What you are talking about doesn't exist.

I don't get people like you. You think I don't understand exactly why you are replying?

You hate how everything I just said is true, and you are incapble of refuting any of it. I guess I should add to the list, talking about sexism without getting some idiot arguing against them with no argument. 

See if I was female, you'd just take my word for it, and leave me be. Since I'm a man, you feel the need to educate me, despite you being incapable of making a valid point, or refuting any of my points.

&gt; only if she's willing to sleep with someone she likely isn't attracted to.

Yep. So what I'm saying is true. A woman can literally get laid whenever she wants. This is why its important to use logic and forethought. That way you can avoid situations like this where you think you are disagreeing with someone, but in reality you are just supporting their argument.

&gt; men can do that too.

No they cannot objectively speaking. I can tell you are a sexist misandrist, I can tell you hate men. You just hate the idea of someone like me pointing out all the privilege you have as a woman. Try making an online dating profile as a man, like every single profile you see, and watch as all these desperate unattractive women would would sleep with anyone don't match with you lol. I'd be impressed if you got to a point where you were actually able to display your personality.

&gt; there are lots of very desperate unattractive women who would sleep with anyone who is just a little nice to them.

Nope. Those women don't exist.

&gt; what's wrong with being pro women?

Nothing. 

&gt; i'd understand if you said anti-men, but the way you worded it sounds like you personally think that supporting women is a bad thing?

Yea, because you are a sexist misandrist. You need to make wild assumptions about my beliefs and mentality in order to form a counter argument. Its how narcissists convince themselves they are right, when objectively speaking they are wrong.

&gt; Only if the man is desperate and has low self esteem. Men can also get away with this is if the girl is like that. This isn't a gender thing, it's a power balance thing, men and women can abuse this.

Objectively speaking not true. That said, you just said a bunch of words and forgot to make a point. Proof that what you say isn't true, is based on the fact that men are always expected to make the first move. Yes, if that wasn't the case, you'd be right. But it isn't. To women putting in effort into a relationship means putting yourself out there so guys make a move on you lol."

So maybe you feel targeted, even though you describe yourself as not like the person I describe, because you do use weed to escape the real world.

Also, I was never more depressed than when I used to smoke all day, every day. I did that for probably 4 years straight, and was always depressed if I wasn't high, so I was always high. Kind of like how an alcoholic is depressed if they're not drunk.

Once I stopped smoking my depression went away. That begs the question though, did my depression go away because I quit smoking or did I quit smoking because my depression went away? I think it's the former, because depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain and weed causes chemical changes in the brain.

I support recreational use of weed. Just like I support recreational use of alcohol. I support prescribed medical use of weed. Just like I support prescribed medical use of Xanax and Zoloft.

"I used to feel exactly like you. I really did. Until I became an addict myself at age 32. I was using everyday for 4 years. I was also a good parent who never put my children at risk. There are a lot more people like me out there who are addicts but nobody knows. My own parents never knew about my drug use, which is hard to believe, I know. As crazy as it sounds, it does depend on the drug. There are substances out there that pretty much make it impossible to be a good parent, but there are also some that are addicting, yet you still have control of everything you do. I don't buy drug use as an excuse to abuse children because I have always loved my kids and provided for them, been involved in school and extracurricular activities, they've had more opportunities of traveling, fun vacations, toys than a lot of kids their age, as well as non-material things such as love, affection, learning together, laughing together, and telling them in multiple ways that they are beautiful, smart, and kind. I'm definitely not a perfect parent by any means, but the mistakes that I've made are common parenting issues that didn't have to do with drugs. Anyone who abuses their kids are scum to begin with. People just only hear about the drug users who are terrible people, but there are some who are good people with a bad habit and who still care more for their kids than anything else in the world, especially more than a stupid drug. I'm not saying it's a good thing- of course it's better to be clean. But, in situations like mine, taking the kids away, despite knowing that they are unharmed and cared for is just going to throw that person deeper into addiction. Working with that person to get help and giving them support and someone who believes in them is going to give them lots of motivation to get clean. Basically it would be breaking a family apart when it's not necessary. I DO NOT think that MOST cases are like this, but to lump all addicts together and say that they all should get their kids taken away is, imo, a mistake that could make things much worse in some cases.

"Funny.  This past weekend we were at the air show in Chicago on Oak Street beach.  My wife suggested we get a rental umbrella and she sent our kid over to check the prices.  $20 for an umbrella and $75 for a canopy thing.  We passed.  Anyway, a little while later after the show was over, we saw a kid gathering up the umbrellas in a pile on the beach.  I pointed this out to my son and said ""Listen, when it comes time to get a summer job and you want to come downtown and do something, you DO NOT want to be the kid having to gather up used beach umbrellas, ok.""

Lily-white from the neck down, his slightly chubby belly shaking, his adorable small penis and balls flapping and his surprisingly cute, round, white bubble butt jiggling behind him.

As he touched the wall of the hallway and ran back, we heard a bunch of college freshman aged girls yell ""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! WORK IT NEKKID BOY!!!"" and take out their cell phones.

On imgur a week later we stumbled onto a post that said ""NAKED GEEK BOY GOES WILD!"" with a crystal clear, HD shot of my naked boyfriend streaking bare-assed from behind. It had over 100,000 views lolol.

"Where do you think dogs in shelters came from? They're from puppy mills or BYBs. Personally I'd much rather buy from a breeder who knows what they're doing, dogs are health checked, parents have stable temperaments and structure, puppies are properly cared for and raised with Avidog/Puppy Culture guidelines, sold on contracts to carefully screened homes, breeder is matching each puppy to the home based on the family's needs and the results of temperament evaluation (not Volhard, that test sucks), etc. There are amazing breeders who truly care about the quality of the dogs. And your breeder is a forever resource with any question you have, or if something comes up and you can't keep your dog, your breeder is your rescue. The breeder I got my puppy from? She took back a 7 year old when the family had to move to Hawaii to care for a family member. It's insanely expensive to get a dog to Hawaii and pretty stressful for the dog, and they couldn't afford it on top of their own move and caring for their family member. Breeder took the dog back, marketed, and found a new home. We wouldn't even need shelters if we stopped buying from BYBs."

"It wouldn't be if everyone had the mindset of upvoting content/comments based on which numbers are satisfying to look at. Lol, that sounds so ridiculous just thinking about it"
"&gt; How dare we want our income to support us *without wanting to learn a valuable trade that will give a worthwhile return on our investment in our education*!

FTFY"
"Unpopular opinion: That was the moment I realized I hated Shrek 1. I'd had my doubts all the way through, but that was the point I felt it went mean-spirited.

I've enjoyed all the other Shrek films, except 3, and both Shrek II and Puss in Boots are tremendous and wonderful films, top of the heap."

"We call them that cuz they look and feel microwaved, doesnt matter who's making them"
So she alcoholic?
"You can ""experience"" ASMR? I just thought it was a cringey and unsettling video genre."
"It's not mine, it's hers. I was with a virgin and we just couldn't do it because it hurt her too much. So we went to a movie and she was trying to be naughty,  tried blowing me and threw up all over my crotch."
that little stupid ass bitch. That's who you shouldn't be fucking with.
Pretty Gay
Why would he be? You need the space to get up to highway speed because it's basically impossible to merge without matching speed.
Straight marriage. It just ends up in breeders dropping their crotch fruit all over the place. 
I think millennials aren't as materialistic as previous generations.  They'd rather spend money on travel or activities than fancy food.
"Would you never again have sex with a woman just because you watch porn? Pedophilia is grotesque and there is zero proof encouraging child raping desires in this way in any way stop child rapists from raping. Rape, even raping children, is way more complex that just lusting. You literally endanger children and make pedophilic, child raping desires the norm when you allow shit like this.

Get help, don't fucking encourage your sickness. 

Also, there is no proof that pedophiles are born that way. We just have yet to figure out how human sexuality works."
"That's certainly true, but I think that irrespective of the quality of food, millennials are less likely to focus on restaurants than older generations.  I'm also a millennial.  My parents often go to restaurants to hang out with friends, while I prefer coffee shops, bars, the park, etc."
Trying inhaling the scent of 5 years worth of daily newspapers stacked up in a hoarder's house. You won't like the smell of newspapers anymore after that. 
Shenanigans shenanigans shenanigans shenanigans shenanigans shenanigans. Can i have my pistol whipping now please. With a wristy.

"Completely agree. The vocals in no way match with the face melting instrumentals. When they first came out, I remember thinking, ""Holy fuck! This is badass!"". Then, whatshisface would start shitting up the song with his fucktarded vocals and lyrics. Would change the station or turn the radio off altogether. "

"I'm not really comparing myself to non programmers, me myself, I never even tried programming till last year, that is when I saw i was special at it, created programs much faster then others with no help without any prior experience "

"I think I'm pretty gifted in programming, last semester year in computer science I never studied a minute and rarely asked for help while everyone else was struggling to get a C in the tests and programs while I wasn't studying and getting best test scores on many tests and quizzes "
He got two scoops of ice cream and eats bacon and eggs for breakfast 
"It's a natural extension of the core philosophy, which is sick and twisted. "
"My personal viewpoint - no one should be allowed to own a gun - any gun - without showing just cause. And ""personal protection"" is not a just cause. My reason? No one NEEDS a gun. Reducing the number of guns reduces your need to have a gun, not the other way around. Plus, the ridiculously east access to guns in America feeds the world with high-powered, cheap guns; leading to increased violence everywhere. "
"That's a size thing as well. If you're the smaller person, you should move."
AHAHAHAHA
