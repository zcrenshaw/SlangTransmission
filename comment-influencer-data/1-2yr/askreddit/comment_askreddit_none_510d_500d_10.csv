"I think your understanding of weight it very off. 600 is excessive but 300 is actually not that large of a person. I sit right in that range and walk, run, lift and do everything else normally, including sex."

"You're correct, this is not a thing."
"Well, race is more of a individual thing right? 

Like if someone had brown eyes you wouldn‚Äôt say they have heterochromia because one of their parents had blue eyes.

So that‚Äôs why I thought of vitiligo, when I hear biracial I think of having both at the same time somehow.

"It's not middle ground, it's mansplaining. "
"eh, i agree with you about wanting to wear a condom. my girl feels the same as you do so we never use one. what i do is keep track of her cycle. i recommend you do this too. the rule i have made is, from the day her period starts (aka the day she first starts bleeding) it is safe to then cum inside of her for 7 days after that point. (note: we have sex during her period but i know a lot of people don't - not sure how you feel about this topic.) After those 7 days are up, you now have 14 days where you CANNOT safely cum inside of her.  after these 14 days are up, you now should have roughly 7 days more until her next period starts. These 7 days are also safe to cum inside (during this time period right before the period starts is actually the safest possible time, because the egg has already left, so it is actually impossible for her to get pregnant)   so how it goes is.  14 days in a row with 0 chance to get pregnant, 14 days in a row that there is a bit of a chance. tho actually, she can only get pregnant for a period of 3 days, which is in the middle of that 14 day period. i just say 14 days to be absolutely sure."

"As a guy who can relate to exactly what you feel, I would try intermittent fasting and general caloric restriction for a few months.  I went through a lot of bad acne and figured this is life, I wasn't fat at all, in fact I was pretty fit but decided I wanted to be extra lean and did intermittent fasting (sometimes 24h fasting if I was feeling good) for around 3 months.  I lost 20lbs in around 4 months.  The acne is still here but it's not life altering, I don't have breakouts that make me wish I was at home instead of Disney world.  I honestly beleive my acne was hormonal and the fasting helped fix whatever was out of balance. "
And how much of space has been mapped already? Probably more so than the ocean LOL 
You prove one of my points.
The article you referenced is just an opinion piece of on why the study design of a particular African study was flawed. There is still evidence from developed countries that show a reduction in non-HIV infection rates for adult males who are circumcised. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2907642/

"But also, it is frustrating when you go to a lgbtq night at a club and it's pretty much all straight - seeming male female monogamous couples.  If you are in one of these couples please stop, you're not supporting the gay community by showing up, you're making it impossible to flirt. 

Edit, haha I guess I found the assholes who do this.

To be clear: if a venue goes out of their way to have a night for LGBTQ people YES it really is inappropriate to show up with your opposite gendered partner and use the space to feel cool and good about yourself while you get drunk and grind on each other. You are selfish and oblivious. And if you are a straight guy coming to pick up bi women, get out, no one wants that. 

  Seriously why do y'all need to show up to the ONE PARTY YOU WEREN'T INVITED TO?  When you can go to any other one anywhere?"

Also, we have [Ghusl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghusl) which is also required... 

And mind you, this is even forced if you want to pray. You cannot enter mosque and pray if you don't do this. ...

"&gt;Just that there are more male attacks on female. 

Men are more often the victims of violence than women are.
Women therefore experience violence less. Men are therefore more victimised by violence.

Statistics are fun!

&gt;Males are more violent and larger, in general.

Women are also irrational, emotionally swayed and less fit for competitive environments. It's all in the biology, you are allowed to characterise men as dumb brutes but when you point out the misgivings of the other side, it's now ""wrong"".

"I'll probably delete this later, but how is the idea of ""gender"" not completely sexist? It implies that there are differences between men and women beyond what sex parts they have. How is the idea of being trans not completely dependent on sexist cliches specific to men and women?

That is often a sign that someone is gay.    

&gt; They would have come out by now. 

Says who?  Some people have a really hard time realizing they are gay.  It takes something like a heart attack and almost dying in their 50s or 60s for them to get real with themselves.    

&gt;One of them is quite the playboy with women.

Sounds like he has something to prove.  Also, sounds like he moves around to different women a lot, which suggests that they never quite do it for him.     

&gt;If he was secretly gay, why would they enjoy sex with women so much?

If he was secretly gay he would put on a big show about how much he likes sex with women, which is what it sounds like he is doing.  You have no idea how much he actually enjoys sex with women.

"What a scumbag.  

As to you feeling guilty for not immediately believing the person who said they were raped, my ex said her ex boyfriend and her dad had each raped her.  She later admitted both were lies.  She also claimed that I had physically abused her after we split up which was also a lie.  It isn't shitty to hear the other party out and yes, some people really do lie about rape.  It sucks that it happens, but it does, so being open to the possibility that someone could be lying isn't a bad thing just like being open to the possibility that someone could be telling the truth isn't a bad thing.  Be supportive, but be open to the possibility that what you hear may not be accurate.  It's why we don't convict people solely on the basis of a single person's testimony: it's never ""beyond a reasonable doubt."""
