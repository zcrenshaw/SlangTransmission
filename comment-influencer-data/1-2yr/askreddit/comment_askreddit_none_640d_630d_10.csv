"Why are gay men delightful to spend time around and yet lesbians are horrible? I say this as a straight male. Gay men express themselves through their sexuality similarly - but yet it doesn't define their characters. Lesbians have to live and breathe Lesbianism. At least the ones I know. They're like vegans, atheists and Jehovah's witnesses rolled into one. You MUST know what men were barking up the wrong tree when they came onto you. You must know how much we love P!ink and plaid shirts. You MUST know how as a straight white male you are not entitled to have an opinion on anything and you are NOT part of our club and you do NOT exist in our little bubble. We WILL congratulate ourselves for every day of our existence, every sexual conquest and every little bit of lesbianism we spread.

I mean....fuck, I love the idea of girls getting it on. But damn if you people aren't the WORST to spend time around! Every lesbian I've known has been a fucking idiot. You know, the Pankhurst spouting sleeve tattoo sporting ones who say you're mansplaining when you disagree with them? Most gay men I know are great fun to spend time with."

"I think Canadians are high and mighty with their crown BS. They are very narrow minded with their gun laws and believe it is best to leave it up to the government to tell them they cant own guns.

her, we sell cups for the machine, i have you charge you $6 for the cup
me, i don't need a cup, just pass me one of those plastic food trays, you can have it back after.
her, can't do that
me, okay, i'll just come back there, and drink from the tap using my hands,
her, ummm, no
me, so...at this point you are denying my access, to publicly funded clean water - correct?
her, yes, you can't have the water
me. *inhales* let me tell you about the united nations charter of basic human rights - in perticular the section on water - and how its a nessessity to human life - and how it is a crime to deny one human the right to water with exception if giving said water would harm yourself or your family...

i should point out, the machine was on my side - if i was a dick i could've nabbed any of the stupid sugar drinks - - - i just wanted the water. fought hard for it after all. "

"Transgender man is not hermafrodyte. So they have not one single part in there body that is feminem. Wich makes this a mental illness. Now I don't care what you do I will treat you like a lady if you want to and even kiss you like one if you come to visit. But atleast admit it is a mental illness which maybe could be solved if someone would talk to you about your problems and said what is wrong with it. Instead of the tolerant people we became now and say everything is alright, nothing is wrong. If you got to a doctor 50 years a go and said you want to be a female, that would be bad. 
20  years ago you needed to do a whole traject of pshyciatry tests and it took years before you could make it happen. It also made alot decide not to get true with it it also made others hate the wait. If you now go to a doctor and you say the word women on your appointment, you walk out with a vagina..even before puberty hits you . Now it's all hunky dory but if we continue like this in about 25 years you can identify as a fucking elephant and get yourself a trumpet sewn on your head. Afcourse hey, if it makes you happy no problem. But don't come complaining to me if your neighbour installed a whale mating call vocal cord because it made him feel better. "

"Straight people have all these weird rules about stuff like this —
 especially the way that so many people treat dating someone as rendering them forever out of bounds for their friends, as if they've peed on them and claimed them. Now, maybe they *did* pee on them; but we're not wild animals, and we don't mark territory like that.

Part of this is almost certainly that straight people have a much bigger pool of potential partners than most LGBTQ folks do, even in relatively big cities, but I think this stuff probably gets in the way more than it helps.

Yeah, in general, most 30-year olds won't tend to be compatible with folks who are still ""college-aged"", and there's probably not much point in looking for long term relationships there, but as long as you're not being a creep, and as long as you follow the [campsite rule](https://www.thestranger.com/25-years-of-the-stranger/2016/10/12/24611204/savage-love-glossary) in any relationships, hookups, or FWB situations, lots of these black and white rules seem pretty silly to me.

If you meet another adult and it works…go for it. Just be thoughtful, careful, respectful, and caring, and you should probably be good to forget about math.

(Just to be clear, most people who specifically trawl for partners who are much younger and much less experienced than them *are not* being thoughtful, caring, or respectful. They're generally being manipulative creeps, but the half plus seven rule isn't stopping them, either.)"

"Except that it's not that simple, because treating women the same as men is actually considered sexist by feminists. They're not okay with equal rights and equal treatment, they demand equal outcomes. How hard is it to not be sexist? Easy, by a conventional definition of sexism. But naturally, feminists warp and distort the definitions of words to increase their purview and power. Everything is sexist. Everything is racist. Are you male? Did you speak? That's sexist."

Having been in a (bad) relationship with somebody that was literally psychotic and needed FAR more than any one (or 5) people could provide, I can tell you that people's needs are all over the spectrum. As long as you demonstrate clearly that it's not the fault or shortcoming of your husband, and offer him the same freedom to fuck other people, I have faith that he will understand your position.

Telling him what you need ahead of time is far better than waiting for the dam to break, and cheating."

&gt;“Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1784. 

This hadeeth indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will feel proud of his ummah before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children. 

Look if you don't believe your religion, or have the guts to abandon it because you're beliefs are not compatible then why should I care about your label?

Your prophet had 12 wives, polygyne is a system to maximise the birthrate.

I care much more about having ancestors than I care about, fame beyond the grave. Sure you can do great things in life, more reason to create people that can do so.
