Uber is mad expensive and I live in an outlying area. Very def not driving. So opted for a stay in. Gonna be odd not being hungover in the morning.
"actually, kids that grow up really wealthy think like this during grade
school. they just don't know any different, so you can't blame them. 

i grew up in the public school system where people were ""cool"" based on their looks or being stupid fucking rich. but my bff at the time went to private school and their life was like, sure it's great if you look good, but coolness was def established via how much your family was worth and how big the house was and what job you had, etc. so some kids that were in very well-off families, like in the 6 figure income range in texas, still felt like they were poor.

from another perspective, i also remember watching this doc done by a rich about rich kids and he was like ""i just assumed how i lived is how everyone lived."" and that's true for all of us as kids, so i can relate. when you're very young, you're sheltered and you view is very myopic -- you don't have much to compare. 

anyway, that's all."
yeah he def plays up the attitude for TV. i’m sure if you were willing to learn and take advice he’d be chill
