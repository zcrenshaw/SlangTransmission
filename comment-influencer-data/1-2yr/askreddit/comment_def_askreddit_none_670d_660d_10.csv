Omg!  I refuse to believe.  There is def a delightful supermarket filled with happy piggies doing their shopping 
"
I was on a rugby team and we were animals who def thought we were cool. 

I had to lock my door with a Padlock or people would use my couch. I could not even open it without bringing on the flood. So if I would crawl in my secretly opened window if I needed a respite.

21 empty keg pyramids people set up and jumped through. Paint can dumped down heating vents. Fire extinguisher blitz. Knife throwing in the walls. 5 years of cheap tiles layed every year broken through all the way to the old wood floor in some places which had decomposed and mixed with spilled bear to create mud spots. Beer Pong table was a road sign. Flip cup table was a broken 52 inch flat screen resting on a broken mini fridge. Fence was made of all sort of materials nailed on haphazardly to cover the holes from people regularly tackling other people through it. Filthy couches for standing on only, not sitting but used like an elevated platform on a dance floor. And maybe the best, holes literally punched through walls to watch people having sex. Also pretty much everyone was constantly decked out in thrift store apparel which the seniors passed down every year building a collection of ridiculous cloths that made up most of our wardrobes. "
"Of course but headlines like DEADLIEST SHOOTING IN HISTORY are a red rag to a bull for some people who want to top it, and I would say that type of thing is def damaging "
"Why has **Troll 2** not been mentioned yet? Here's the top review from IMDB:

&gt;This is it, folks: the worst movie ever made.

&gt;I know, I know, there are many who argue that ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" are worse ""films"" than this one. Well, I'd advise those people to give ""Troll 2"" another viewing, this time with an open mind. As something of a self-made authority on the worst of the worst in modern cinematic torture, I feel qualified to make the bold assertion that ""Troll 2"" is the cream of that particular crop.

&gt;From its laugh-inducing soundtrack (apparently recorded using only a vintage 1980s Casio keyboard) to its unilaterally awful acting, ""Troll 2"" is a life-changing experience, similar to the Middle Ages' trials by fire. If you succeed at ingesting this festering piece of cinematic detritus in one sitting, you will emerge a new person, like a phoenix rising from its own ashes. The watching itself may be painful, but it is ultimately worth the pain to be able to say, with conviction, ""I survived 'Troll 2,' and I'm still technically alive.""

&gt;The special effects in this movie are, indeed, special -- like a one-legged blind woman with Alzheimer's. Trivia: one of the various Emmanuelles from the infamous ""Emmanuelle"" series of soft-core porno movies designed this movie's pitiful costumes. That should give you some indication of their quality.

&gt;The acting -- my God, where do I start? Suffice it to say that, if you set any cast member on fire, I would lay down even money that he or she would have a hard time convincing onlookers that it hurt. They're really that bad. More trivia: One of Elliot's ""boys"" in this movie would later go on to reprise his role (Disposable Character in Bad Movie) in the Lou Diamond Phillips classic ""Bats."" Even more trivia: The father in this movie was a local dentist, and most of the extras were bona fide Utah residents, as well. Talk about low-budget.

&gt;Back to the soundtrack -- There's not a single scene in the movie where the music is appropriate to the on-screen action. I get the impression that the ""composer"" employed for this stinker was, in fact, a failed auditioner for Def Leppard's still-vacant keytarist position. Seriously, it's rare, even in straight-to-video dogs like this one, to hear music of this woeful caliber.

&gt;What more can I say that hasn't already been set forth in previous reviews? This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and that's saying something. It's physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting to watch this film -- I recommend doing it alone, at least the first time you see it...that way, you can concentrate on its truly majestic badness -- and on feeling your brain cells die off, one by one, until you are no longer able to speak.

&gt;Good luck to you, if you decide to watch this one. It doesn't get any worse than ""Troll 2.""

&gt;ADDENDUM (October 2007): This is still the worst movie of all time. Its status as such will never change. ""Troll 2"" is simply the perfect storm of bad writing, casting, direction, cinematography, costuming, score, makeup, effects, acting, editing, and inspiration.

&gt;UPDATE (June 2010): I just watched it again. Alone. In one sitting. God help me, some component of my brain must be fundamentally defective.

&gt;POSTSCRIPT (September 2013): This film continues to alter the life of each man, woman, and child with the good fortune/taste to bathe in its glory. I could not recommend it more strongly. "
