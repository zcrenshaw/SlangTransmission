"Honestly? I'd say stick with stuff that's more traditional or neotraditional. Notice how all those styles have pretty thick lines and bold colors. Also black. Black is essential to a tattoo. Sure, you can do super pastel-y and watercolor designs, but they tend to fade and need more touchups. Black holds up in the skin the best. 

But again, I'm but a mere apprentice and there's a lot more to learn. Def ask your tattoo artist."
"Work friends is the easiest route to go.  Pick co-workers who are in your age bracket, not-married, and have a social life.  Try to slowly work your way into that group.  So start with going to lunch with them like once a week... then progress to after work drinks on a Friday.... then from there you can kinda get involved in their social world as long as they seem receptive.

Other than that... co-ed intramural sports leagues are the way to go.... so def. check that out."
I'd def be interested in the supernatural ones!
