"For some reason that reminded my of my story like that.   Met a girl, went out a couple times. Once we went to a club which she invited me to, after 2 minutes she just left me standing there to talk to some guy, 20 minutes or so pass and I said fuck it, and went home.   A week or 2 later she (worked in the music industry) and invited me to have dinner with Chris Connelly of Ministry/Revolting cocks, as much as I loved them, I wasn't going to be second banana and said no."

Except for the fact where it basically implies you find the other partners body unattractive?
Why did you spell aunt like that? Always thought that pronunciation was weird. As opposed to Aunt. 
I've heard both sides of a marriage and women do this as well. So many people in shitty marriages but the sheer amount of effort to get divorced keeps them together. I had to recently dump a friend because of the constant complaining about their SO and how her husband doesn't help with parenting.
The smuts do.

Never!  How could anyone do such a thing?
You think a single reddit comment qualifies as a big deal?

"No open carry and no handguns. I like Canada‚Äôs gun laws. We are allowed to have hunting rifles (but not openly carry it around in public) and no handguns. So if you‚Äôre worried about not being able to protect yourself if there‚Äôs an intruder in your home, you‚Äôre still able to. "

"I can confirm your words with numbers. 

I can repeat. It figures, the scientists are not historians or demographers, it figures publicists. 

They were written in the early 90s. the Study of this issue in the Soviet Union was banned. So it was all based on speculation.

Since then, this question is studied by real scientists, on the basis of documents, not fantasies."

"To be fair though, homosexuality isn‚Äôt natural in animals nor plants. Even in humans it isn‚Äôt natural, it‚Äôs all based on the environment the individual is in and other factors. I don‚Äôt care if someone is homosexual, but I hate it when they say it‚Äôs natural."

You act like this is a hard question. All of the top comments say very clearly how to react. Very rarely will doing what is told get you killed.

"It's interesting that you automatically associate believing in God with Christianity. As if there aren't 100+ other systems that have at least one god in them, each with their own creation story (figurative or literal). 

I find it funny that Christians try to justify their entire belief system by just asserting that there must be a God. As if that gives any validity to their specific system that goes way beyond just why things exist.

We are certainly lucky to be graced with your wisdom
Your story literally has no point. You dumped him because it was an alpaca? Lmao wtf

"By the looks of it you‚Äôre main argument for most hits is that these issues were all created by men and kept alive by men. I dont know if you looked through the whole article but there was an entire section dedicated to articles and sources of feminist disrupting men from trying to make any progress on their own rights. You say you would help join the fight but then that makes you one of the few and I respect you for that but now we need to involve the rest of the feminist movement. If it‚Äôs men on men why are feminists intervening? I feel like you didn‚Äôt really look through any of the sources of the article or at least read their descriptions but they‚Äôd be more explanatory. 

Towards the end you seemed to make several unfounded assumptions of me as an attempt to make look like what exactly? I‚Äôm not sure but you‚Äôre partially right I‚Äôm not giving it all I‚Äôve got atm. I do my little part to raise awareness which is a little intimidating since I live in Seattle. It is also why I didn‚Äôt jump into a full blown rant or attack and just said take a look at this since it looked relevant because I dot personally feel like I‚Äôm out of touch.

"Aldis in America looks like a warehouse where food was just sprinkled around every aisle and they only recently, like a year ago, accepted plastic instead of paper. Every time I go there I go to get a shopping cart and realize I can't because I don't carry cash and they require a cash deposit to use a fucking cart.

I'm glad they treat their employees well because customers are an after thought"

"The thing about Christianity that a lot of people overlook is no sin is worse than another.

So 2 guys butt fucking are no worse than you lusting over that hot piece of ass at work, or that murderer that was released last week. If Christians left the judging to God maybe we'd all live a happier life. "

This is really important BECAUSE some people see 'being racist' as a personal thing while some see it as an institutionalized, systemic thing.

So, ask your friend to clarify."
