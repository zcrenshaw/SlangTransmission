"I had a older woman smack me on the leg because apparently I was in her ""spot"" in the sauna.

No excuse me or anything just a smack and a point to love over.

She spoke perfect english she was just a bitch.

I was abused as a child and I am very strict about my personal space plus that was just rude.

I wanted to hit her back but I for up got the manager and he kicked her and her crew out.

Apparently her and her friends made a habit of doing that, they felt because they were older it was ok.

It wasnt."
"Definite ""no.""  I've made this mistake and ended up waiting an additional 40 minutes for someone who was ""10 minutes away!""  I was being paid, of course, but it wasn't worth the extra $8 bucks on my check.  Now they can fuck off."
I strongly dislike people that see an opportunity to take advantage of the situation and act on it. He was staring at his sunglasses during your apologies because his brain caught on to how he could milk this and was working out the deets. 
I thought you were going to say he was trying to purchase a gift card with the same gift card. That would have been hilarious. 
You're right. She probably didn't learn anything at all. 
"Wow, the fact that she proceeded to complain about the quality of her haul too...my freaking word..."
"&gt;CR: scoffs ""But my house is all nautical themed. You should have a lot of nautical stuff.""

Yes, Yes silly of us to not stock thousands of dollars in merch because one person might want to buy some of it."
I'm requesting stories about how you shot down customers who treated you like an idiot.
"""is it in feet or meters?""

""i dont know!""

""is it a small area""

""I dont know!""

""this is ridiculous. you muck up my - ""

*punches lady in the face, in Just World*"
"That's awesome he made her leave. I would've wanted to smack her back and say fuck off, but really getting her kicked out is better. "
"That is really weird. So you gave her small bills with each purchase, she just choose to use larger ones.

That screams fraud to me."
There's always that one good person who realizes you're a person too
"I love how she makes it your fault that she decided to go shopping rather than making sure she was at the school on time to keep her 6 year old granddaughter from waiting outside in the cold for her. As much responsibility as she's lacking, it's scary anyone would entrust a child to her!"
"‘Excuse me sir, I am not a slotmachine...’

Seriously though, the “You’re buying both games.” was perfect!"
"Working in a family owned shop was one of my favorite jobs as a teen for this exact reason! We were a bit popular for our area and had a good selection of items so people would come from all over to shop there! The store hours have always been 9-7pm and not a second later as the owners liked to have family dinner by 8pm every night. 

I would get people calling in at 6:59 saying they were 5 minutes away and needed to grab something quickly and we would always just hang up on them and watch from either inside the doors or as we were walking out as they went up to the dark, locked store and try the door handle...a few times we were even bitched at from the customer for not bending over for them and that they were calling corporate...which was my bosses house phone that they never answered! "
"I had an old lady nearly run me over with her motorized scooter then poke my belly after saying I ""Look like I'm ready to pop"". I'm 6 months pregnant and honestly not that big. Like small enough for people to not even know I'm pregnant. I was too shocked to say or do anything. "
But her house is all naitical themed.
"Wanna bet ""I called the bank and they said I had over $2000 dollars on it"" really means ""I got a letter that said I was preapproved for up to $2000."""
Well that was nice of them to send you flowers. 
"I know! I'm sorry your stolen change is ""just"" pennies?!"
I’m glad you recognize the concept of “not with the extra $8.” I have employees who bleed out the clock and stay an extra hour to get a little extra pay. Good for you for the entire almost $10 you got after taxes. 
"Personally I hate it when customers touch me. I would have explained realllllly sweetly what you were going to do, because then she would realize she doesn't have to touch people."
Isn't it great when people don't understand their own language?
"&gt; I don't get paid past 5:00pm

I’m pretty sure that’s illegal in most places; if you wind up having to work past 5 for a legitimate reason (late cursetomer, big spill you have to clean up right at the end of the day, etc.), the company is probably required to pay you for that time."
"I wish just once that the other customer would respond to the crazy customer by saying ""you're an idiot lady"" or something to that effect."
"We once had this big ass biker guy standing in line waiting for food at top lunch rush. The lady in front of him was drilling my employee and refused to let me, the manager, approach. She would immediately put her hand up and state ""this is between us"" she was yelling at this poor fifteen year old that when we said 3 minute wait on a cook-to-order item she didnt get it until 4 and a half minutes and telling this poor kid he didnt amount to anything. The biker just calmly taps her shoulder. Asks super softly if shed ever worked service. The woman responds with ""No. I would never be caught dead in a felon's job like this."" And ignoring her insult to us he just yelled ""Then Shut the Fuck Up"" and as much as I SHOULD have kicked him out, it was the most vindicating thing to watch ever. "
You should have replied with a link to the address for your store 
"I get a mall employee’s discount at one food stand at my local mall.  I haven’t worked at the mall in 11 years.  I’ve told the stand owners that I’m not a mall employee anymore, but she insists.

Thank you, Aunt Annie’s stand owner!  You are awesome!"
If anyone were to use a derogatory term when speaking to me (regardless of whether or not the word is aimed at me) I would refuse to service them. That is extremely inappropriate and they should know better. I won't reward behavior like that. 
I hope you triple checked that those larger notes were genuine.
"We’ve got our staff tip jar out for xmas. The amount of people who think it’s ok to ask if they can have some of the money from our jar to put to their total is ridiculous. 

As for the lady I hope Karma gets her. "
"""Maybe if I barricade myself in the bathroom, I'll escape the evil grasp of loss prevention!"""
"I see your logic but I also see their logic too. One extra hour isn't a whole lot but if you can do that every day, that's almost a whole nother days pay right there. It adds up over time and it is smart."
He was also probably trying to figure out the highest amount he could claim they cost without looking TOO greedy.
"I just straight sat ""do not touch me."" Most are embarrassed but regardless, no manager is going to say you should have let her touch you. But really little old ladies are the worst! When i was younger I would always get grabbed by the bicep. Either I don't look as approachable now because of age, or handedness or I just leave too much space to present the opportunity, but it's been a while since it happened. "
"Most of the time, i let things slide. They don’t know my jargon, I don’t know theirs. Tropical does imply hawaiian shirts and coconuts. But I have conifers that *only* occur naturally in the tropics. I’d love to sell her one.

I say stupid stuff all the time. I don’t ‘educate’ people who obviously work in a field I’m not in though.

“You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.”"
"It wasn’t wrong. That would be my first thought and if I spoke sign language, I probably would have done the same thing. 

He’s just a weird guy. Who didn’t think someone would assume he’s deaf if he wrote notes instead of using his voice."
I bet if she knocks over a glass while eating out she yells for the server to complain about the unacceptably messy state of the restaurant.
"Or OP could be Salary, which have fixed hours scheduled."
The sad part is he's sure to take it out on the kid when they get home.
Ahahahahahahahaha! This is one of my fav stories now lol. I love how you force him into buying both games with a blank stare on your face. 
There was one time a guy lost his gloves in our big store.  I had remembered seeing them so I told him where I had seen them and went on my way.  He couldn’t find them and demanded that I pay for his “very expensive gloves” because I had last seen them so I was at fault.  Newsflash: We’re not responsible for your stupidity...
"I'm a bit split by this to be honest. As the manager, no one can tell you not to handle something. Honestly, the moment she said that to me I would have told my employee to go in the back.

Once the manager steps in, this is between the manager and the customer. The customer does not dictate when a manager is 'allowed' in a conversation. While what that biker did was good, he had to do your job for you."
"I worked at a gas station in a rural area that would close at 9 PM every night. I'd shut off all the lights except for a few interior ones. Without fail, at least a few times a week, someone would pull up at 9:03 - 9:10 and try to pump gas, standing there in the dark. Or they'd knock on the window and yell ""Hey! Are you closed? I need cigarettes!""

The best is that after they repeatedly complained about it to the owner, he eventually decided to extend our hours until 10 PM. And these same exact people would then show up at 10:05 PM, knocking on the window, asking why all the lights are out.
"
"I have a similar story. I don't work in retail, but I do work in a huge warehouse for one of the UKs largest DIY stores (we're in the largest 3 globally, if our sales pitches are to be believed).

I was walking in one morning in my uniform (same uniform as the store) when a car pulls up besides me just outside the entrance. A middle-aged women gets out and retrieves one of our toilet seats from the backseat before thrusting it at me.

Me &amp; CL = Crazy Lady

CL: I need to return this!

Me: Errr, I'm not sure what I can do to help you with that. You need to return it at a store.

CL: I bought this HERE!

Me: I'm sorry, I think there's some confusion. We don't sell stock, we ship it to stores. It's a warehouse.

CL: Yes, I bought it from your warehouse yesterday.

Me: Look, sorry, we don't sell stock. We're not even [DIY Store], we're just a logistics company that runs their distribution centres. We can't sell stock or process returns. You need to drive into town to the store.

I then give her directions to the nearest store, meanwhile she stands blank faced.

CL: This is fucking ridiculous! It's within its return period, I checked! They told me I could return it if it didn't fit my toilet and now security won't even let me into the store!

Me: Wait, do you mean store as in [Town name] store, or here?

CL: HERE! Stop telling me it's not a fucking store! It says it on the building, it says it on your uniform!

At this point she starts jabbing at the logo on my uniform, so I raise my voice a bit.

Me: Look, security won't let you in because we're not a store and the public are not ever allowed in. Not ever. There are no tills, there are no sales staff, there is nothing on sale. Head into town, go to the store.

She absolutely flips. She throws the toilet seat at me, before screaming like she's just heard her kids been ran over.

CL: You fucking con artists! You think you've ripped me off? I'm charging back my card! I'm going to citizens advice, trading standards, the ombudsman! My brother-in-law is a solicitor and he's going to shut down every fucking store!

She gets back in her car and tears off. I pick the toilet seat out of the bushes and walk into work to find security has been pissing themselves watching the whole thing on camera. Thanks guys.

Never heard anything back from it, but fuck me has that crazy bitch stuck in my mind."
"""Kids these days have no manners!"""
"Customer: Just look it up! It's on the system."" *gestures continuously toward my till which is incapable of doing anything other than taking payment for things*

You: *Opens till and places different banknotes on the counter* OK, my system here has the queen, Adam Smith, Winston Churchill and Charles Darwin. Which one of them is going to tell me what I need to know?"
"The ""I'm calling corporate"" thing is so annoying especially when you work in a place that doesn't have a corporate office like yours lol. Customers bring up that word like their calling the cops or something and think it's gonna give them everything they want and sadly it can. "
"I love when people say anything that means ""but I need it"" as if you're just hiding it for the people that ""really need it"". And when you say you don't have it, it's really that you don't care about their ""problems""."
