emotional detachment
"This is illegal - you are not allowed to mail explosives, but New York pizza is the bomb."
Paying 80% of your annual income in rent. 
"Go to The Door, they specialize in youth issues (homelessness/mental illness/education needs/etc) up to age 26. 212-941-9090 or walkin until 8pm at 555 Broome st. 

check with Covenant House, which is a youth-only shelter that also provides services. 212-613-0300 or walk in any time. At 460 W. 41st. "
How would we know what's hit the West Coast/Midwest/South? It's not like we pay attention to them.
He's not taking about someone who goes to your school with an empty room. He's talking about resources through your school for people who can't afford housing. 
It's an inconvenience with no immediate benefit to residents. 
"Dude, it's up to you. Personally I don't, and I don't feel like a dick ignoring them as I walk in or out. I have my own financial worries, and if I had money to spare, and I was feeling charitable, I don't mind grabbing them a drink. Don't have an existential crisis over it. You fed a person. Even if they didn't deserve it, it was a cool thing to do. Just don't feel obligated"
"The High Line a pretty good call- two places I like by the bottom of it are Los Tacos No 1 in Chelsea Market, and Ample Hills ice cream shop inside Bubby's. Both are kind of trendy, and have lines, so depending on what you consider ""chill and unpretentious"" they may not qualify

Also, word to the wise- the folks who talk most about being ""chill"" and/ or ""unpretentious"" are usually pretty fucking unchill and goddamn pretentious ;)"
"Morally, if you make incidental eye contact with him you're obliged to fondle his balls. It's just the right thing to do."
"The PAs are quite often full of themselves and act like they are working on a cure for cancer.  Recently one told me I could not walk down the block to the entrance of my building and suggested I go around (so 3 blocks instead of 1 block) even though nothing was being filmed at the time.  I suggested he go fuck himself.

I live in an area that's VERY popular w/ the film and tv industry and it gets tiring when they're there week after week with their giant trucks, craft services and bullshit attitudes. "
So we'll send something from 2 Bros. I don't think that's cheese. 
"From your post its clear that you don't want to live in this place and would be moving solely for the career opportunity. I think the key question is, if you do put in your two years in East Bumfuck, will you be in a place to move somewhere you'll actually want to live?

Personally, I don't think I could live in the type of place you're describing unless it was temporary with a fixed timeline for returning. 
"
"I bring bagels and cream cheese, but I drive. Maybe black and white cookies?"
Employer here. I have a feeling I'd fire someone who acts like you. 
not having a goatee and cargo shorts
aw shucks you had to pay taxes on your earnings. That sucks... Welcome to everyone else's life.
It's my favorite place on earth. I also hate it with every fiber of my being. 
"All of those restaurants are great but we're not foodie Mecca simply because we have lots of upscale restaurants run by celebrity chefs. We have tons of amazing, inexpensive, authentic cuisine, that doesn't require $150 and two hours in a seat.  "
"&gt; no immediate benefit to residents

I see you've never walked out your door to an unattended catering area"
A drive to wherever you're selling your car. 
"Parent situations can be tough, but legally she can't kick you out without taking you to court. It's your place too."
Doin this later today thank you 
A dozen cookies from Levain. 
"Don't feed the cats... they will eat the roaches after a while
"
Fake weed edibles 
"There's a homeless guy who jacks it every morning at the W4th station on the bench, most people I see don't even feel morally obligated to leave the bench. What's the best case scenario, you give a homeless guy blueballs? What's the worst case scenario? You get murdered by a fully erect hobo. Your morals, your call, I don't know how I wanna go out, but I do hope that it includes zero horny homeless men."
"Can you tell us what you did, how it worked out for you, and where you're living/working now? It would be useful to show to others who ask for similar advice in the future. "
Your school should also have some resources to help you. Have you reached out to anyone there?
"if he doesnt fix it today, say you smell gas. He'll send a guy immediately."
"It's pretty close to impossible to get entry or early-level work in NYC without physically being in NYC. Lots of people say they want to move to NYC until they're confronted with the reality: cost, the noise, leaving all their family, strict/choosy landlords, or whatever other hardship, and then they back out. It's a waste of time from a HR point of view.

So your #1 in getting a job in NYC is being in NYC. Best option is to stay with a friend for a couple weeks, 2nd best is a 1 or 2 month Airbnb or sublet till you get yourself squared away. "
Paying a broker thousands to find an apartment. This is definitely a NYC thing. 
"Please don't support this place.  A good percentage of their puppies are very sick, and they come from puppy mills.  You can go pet puppies at just about any shelter. "
"""Also, word to the wise- the folks who talk most about being ""chill"" and/ or ""unpretentious"" are usually pretty fucking unchill and goddamn pretentious ;)""

SO TRUE lol"
"Tell your landlord to call an exterminator.  You shouldn't have to live with ""not that bad""."
"In the mid-90s, you'd look at classified ads in the Village Voice and New York Press. 

Or you'd see a flyer at the grocery store.

Or you knew a friend who had a friend, etc.

And brokers were always an option. "
I don't know why no one has mentioned it yet but your best option is to take a LIRR train from Penn to Jamaica and then take the airtrain directly to terminal one. It's the most direct and fastest route and the most cost effective too
You would be 100% in the right to call the police. I'd even suggest going down to your precinct and reporting the two previous incidents so that they have a record when you do call. 
"An inability to say please/thank you, unhappiness I can't order whatever food I want at 10pm and get it delivered, and a mild annoyance at the pace at which they do things. 

Or, like others have said, cookies, bagels, bread, or donuts. Pizza or a corned beef/pastrami plate, if close enough for it to not deteriorate too much. "
$800 a room is nowhere near rare. That's standard for most non-fancy hoods
"Yes. It's corny, jingoistic, and loaded. There is no signage anywhere on or around 1WTC referring to it as the ""freedom tower"", and as far as I can tell it is a term coined by Fox News. Between calling it that and sticking an antenna on top to disingenuously make it 1776 feet tall and the tallest building in America, it feels like I'm living in a south park parody version of my own country. "
I'm gonna bring a felt pizza rat from the pigeon lady at Union Square.
I once brought a bunch of Levain cookies as a host gift and they were a hit.
"I wonder if it's meaningfully different from just leaving pizza out on your counter overnight and eating it the next day, which I'm super classy and would definitely never do"
Tax 1 is called the you got screwed tax. 
"I think he was just trying to take full advantage of your kindness- not like he was trying to trick you or be malicious, but like he needed food for later so he was getting as much food now as he could. He *was* pushing it with the bag of chips and two cookies though.

I buy food for people as well sometimes. I don't know what beggars would spend my money on if I gave them cash, but I *do* feel bad for them, so it's just a better option.

If you want to stop, then stop. Keep in mind that this was one guy though. You were just being a good person."
"Ya, I flew with bagels and cream cheese once. The bagels were fine, but the TSA confiscated my cream cheese. Fucking police state ;)"
