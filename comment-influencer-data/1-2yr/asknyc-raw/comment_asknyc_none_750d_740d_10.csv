"I know you're either going to get ignored or down voted but this is probably the best post of the week. ""baby let me bang your box"" was the song of my formative years. #nativenewyorker"
"Others will chime in on the employment search, but you noted suicide. You are so, so young. Don't fall into the NYC trap of thinking everyone at your age is super successful, independently rich, and 100% sure of their life's path. Technically, you just this year [became an adult mentally](http://www.nycjusticecorps.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Stages-of-Adol-YA-Development.pdf), which leads to the common ""quarter life crisis"" we all go through. You're seeing your life in a new scope and it's scary - but we're here to tell you will come out the other side. 

* You're not ""desperate"" - what you described (willing to work anywhere and do anything) means you've got a good work ethic.

* You are not a burden to your friends and family if you need help. If they needed help, and you could help them, you would do the same. That's how life works - we all take turns helping each other. The greatest burden you could give them is having to mourn your death. 

* Eviction is not quick, nor is it the only possibility. Talk to your roommates. Make a plan with friends/family for a fallback option. Couchsurfing is also an option.

* All you need to survive is someplace to sleep, a pot to cook in, and a bag each of rice and beans. Don't overthink your bills - those can wait. Your credit score is not a barometer of worth, and at your age it's pretty meaningless.

* You got this. Good luck."

Why don't you just call them and ask instead of asking people on Reddit
"I don't miss driving because I hate driving, but I do miss the autonomy that comes with having your own private vehicle take you door to door without the rigmarole of walking a few blocks to this or that train station and waiting 5 or 10 minutes for a 20 or 30 minute train ride.  Especially when it's raining or freezing or late at night when you're tired as hell and just Done With It.

So with that in mind, they might like an Uber gift card for those days when you're like ""fuck it, I just want a car to take me there asap"" which can be a godsend.  Things like making a doctors appointment or running late to meet a friend at the movies can be made 95% less of an ordeal with a private car to take you, obviously."
"You can up &amp; down the courthouse steps, Law &amp; Order style. 

But the best/worst stairs are in Morningside Park. There are absolute shittons of stairs. "
The aroma of fresh urine with a hint of moist anus. 
"It's not required if the participants in the conversation are in your home. You have the right to record video and audio of everything that happens inside your apartment, and you are not required to provide notice or obtain consent."
"It's fairly accurate. It doesn't always know all of the station closures, so definitely check the MTA website as well."
"I'm going to say Olive Garden, because they treat you like family."
7:00 AM to be safe. 
Via is always the cheapest but only because it is a shared taxi. The upside is that they have a flat fare of $5 for almost all journeys but the downside is that they don't s serve all of NYC. 
yeah but what if they arrest him over the phone?
"If you need a job quickly, you can cross off any government jobs. MTA, USPS, Sanitation - they all have testing procedures with set timetables and you're not getting hired ASAP from those. Moreover, the benefits make these pretty desirable jobs, so they're not easy to get. 

You should be contacting staffing agencies and looking for temp work. Just google ""nyc staffing agency"" and start calling or submitting your resume online. You can get boring, awful, stupid, temporary work pretty quickly provided that you have a degree and are capable of acting like a grown up in a business environment. 

Temp gigs will get money in your pocket while you try to figure out a longer-term solution. 

Also, don't forget that [NYC Well](https://nycwell.cityofnewyork.us/en/) is out there. You can text ""WELL"" to 65173, call 1-888-NYC-WELL or chat online. "
"Washington heights - near the cloisters.  there are a bunch of HUGE staircases off the 181st A train station.  Most notably at 187 &amp; fort washington , next to the chase bank"
"It's pretty accurate for travel time once you're actually on the train, but doesn't take into account waiting for a train. I usually pad it by 5-10 min for this."
"Just make it $1490. If I saw the ad, I would assume you were hoping get a fellow Nazi for a roommate. "
"When I was young and first moved here, I would have killed to have a roommate with a dog. I wasn't ready for the long term responsibility and couldn't personally make a commitment, but I have always loved dogs and would have been super happy to have a roomie with a great dog. At the time, I was working either 4-midnight or 6AM-4. It might require some effort, but I'd bet amenable folks are out there. "
Have you tried calling the Marriott.
"These are regulated by the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA).

I don't think there is any maximum rate, so long as they comply with the signage standard and other regulations: http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/businesses/PedicabBusinessesAndDrivers.pdf"
"High school science is one of the most needed positions. You are way better off than someone with a general elementary school degree. There was a point where there was a hiring freeze for everything except high school math and science and special ed.


Staten Island jobs are really hard to get. Teachers who live on Staten Island all want them. I work in East New York and have a gym teacher and assistant principal who have been trying to get SI jobs for like 10 years. 


The commute might suck, but you should take whatever job you can get. It'll be easier to transfer to a closer Brooklyn school once you have a job and especially once you have tenure. If you can't get a job (and school starts in two weeks, you should have been asking this months ago), look into subbing. You'll get to know a lot of principals who might know of schools with openings and can recommend you.


 If you work in a high need area, the NYC DoE has some programs where they will pay back part of your loans."
"I've never heard of a private library in the city. I just use the NYPL or sit in Barnes and Noble :) 

What's special about a private library?"
Most likely they were shut down by a health inspector. Did you happen to see a grumpy person with a clipboard?
[The Beekman Hotel bar](https://www.luxdeco.com/styleguide/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The-Beekman-Hotel-New-York-----Bar-Room-----Martin-Brudnizski-interiors--------James-McDonald----LuxDeco.com-Style-Guide.jpg) is insane and makes me feel like a 19th Century aristocrat while I'm there 
"If that was my budget for accommodation, I would probably try for stuff near Union Square. It's a great area with many transportation options and you can walk to lots of other great neighborhoods. I would also recommend buying the $31 per person unlimited week long metro card as it will let you just hop on and off the subway as you please. "
"Former soldier, wanderer and New York City native. NYC is one of a kind. Sure you have cities that have echoes of NYC but there isn't a place with the same history, the same collision of cultures and the same attitude.

Queens native here as well. Good luck in your studies!

"If youre making $70k a year you can definitely afford to live somewhere better than bushwick, and I bet there are more affordable doggie daycares than $400/month. There are alternates like hiring a pet sitter some days or a dog walker, doesnt have to be a bougie dog hotel. "
"It was fun to watch together with all my office mates, share glasses and stare into cereal boxes. Would have been better had it been the full enchilada. "
Building is probably up for sale. 
"Given the law of supply and demand, I'd say they're probably *correctly* priced."
"That happened to me one time, except the announcement said ""1965,"" and when I got out at Times Square it had a ton more porno theaters than I remembered and the cars looked all weird. "
It's really sad. They could actually be a fun and useful mode of transport if they weren't charging scam-high prices. 
You sound stressed out. You should smoke a joint and relax.
No. It's actually still 1976 here. You'll probably die tbh.
"You didn't ask a question...  
&gt;I have applied to schools that are within a reasonable distance in Brooklyn  

Reasonable distance is anywhere in the city. I know Queens teachers from New Jersey, Bronx teachers from Long Island, Manhattan teachers from upstate NY. Apply for New Jersey certification and look for jobs there too."
If you didn't pack your bulletproof vest I'd recommend hiring an armored security car to escort you from Times Sq to your Broadway show and back to your hotel so you can cower there safely
NYC's suicide rate is below the national average.
"Because she's Greek and we're a Greek community - Bay Ridge is actually a surprisingly blue neighborhood. Although, even the Democrats aren't exactly hyped about DeBlasio. 4 of the 5 council candidates are explicitly anti-DeBlasio (Brannan is being endorsed by the Mayor).

That said, even though he's not great, DeBlasio is still better, in my view, than the weak competition. Albanese isn't compelling and Malliotakis, like most Republicans seems to be able to highlight problems, but has no sense about fixing them without just creating new ones. 

For instance, her view on illegal home conversions. She highlights a real problem facing people in the city that causes higher rents, poor living conditions and fire safety concerns. Her view is:

&gt;“The laws are not being enforced with the Department of Buildings so those are issues that I think need to be addressed. They are not enforcing the laws when it comes to the DOB in regards to illegal conversations, which is adding even more congestion because you have multiple families living in a one-family house.”

BUT, if you enforce these laws more strenuously without consideration for the externalities, what you've done is create a homeless problem. People down live in squalor because they *want to*, they do it because they have to in order to afford rent in a predatory marketplace. So, what would Malliotakis do about this new problem she's mindlessly creating? 

&gt;she argued strenuously against the building of new homeless shelters in various neighborhoods, as well as the construction of new jails, which is part of the plan to close Rikers Island. “The idea of building 90 homeless shelters across the city will be heavily rejected by the communities and I don’t think that that’s what people feel the solution should be,”

Fuck 'em, basically. Highlight problem. Solve problem. Create new problem. Now it's someone else's problem. 

So, I think she's bad for the city. Or, at the very least worse than DeBlasio even though his bright idea was to subsidize hotel stays for the homeless, less a solution than a band-aid that also functions as a welfare-for-hotel-owners bonus. "
You have to be more specific than that. The Olive Garden in Times Square is the best one.
"Yup I remember.  Public Access tv in NYC was a thing of beauty.  I remember some show where a rabbi in full orthodox outfit was going on and on about..  idk what, whatever orthodox rabbis talk about I guess.  Actually maybe it wasn't a thing of beauty and I'm just grasping on to the nostalgia because I hate my life."
"I'd ask the super and call him out on lying, but don't mention that you have audio. NY requires one party consent for audio surveillance, and being that you weren't part of the conversation, you're not one of the parties. IANAL though, so somebody might be able to guide you better here.     

Those might have been prospective buyers / broker / current building owner if the owner is looking to sell the building. That's the only thing I can think of regarding the details here.
