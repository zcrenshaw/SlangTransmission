"I think this is a smell you either love or hate, but the hot nuts carts smell so good, especially on a particularly cold night."
people standing in front of the subway doors before letting people out. old dog shit on the sidewalk. potholes in the bike lanes. seeing chicken bones on the sidewalk while i'm walking my dog. people walking slowly 4 or 5 abreast in the sidewalk. tourists with selfie sticks. roaches. missing my train by 15 seconds. having to swipe my metrocard 20 times because the reader is busted. watching the knicks snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. 
"The constant feeling that one should be taking advantage of the city all the time, and keeping up with all the unique fun things that are going on here. Sometimes I feel like I live the same kind of life I would live in Bumbfuck, USA in terms of work/home/repeat "
Meanderthals.
Trying to get anywhere on the subway on a Saturday or Sunday
"• Drivers who honk incessantly out of frustration when they're stuck in a traffic jam

• Large, metal construction plates that clatter when traffic drives over them

• Jackhammering after 10 PM."
"For a serious answer, I assume that a lot of people live in smallish apartments so it confuses me how people out in public are oblivious to the space they're taking up and suddenly lack spacial awareness."
You mean the single person who can block the entire sidewalk by walking down the center and slowly drifting side to side?
"""Excuse me sir, are you Indian?"" said the well-dressed South Asian man. 
I had just withdrawn some cash, we were both in the interior ATM enclosure of a Midtown bank.

He just flew in from India, he said. 
Bags were lost, needed some cash to tie him over til  the airline found them. 

Any friends in NY? First time here, no. 
What about wallet, credit cards? Yes, he has them, but in the bags. 
Won't the airline give him a place to stay? No they said they couldn't, only that they would call when the bags were recovered. Seven more questions, seven perfect answers, not a beat missed.  

I ran out of questions. 
I looked him over silently. 
He looked at me pitifully.

Hopefully.

I had my hand in a pocket, could feel my $20 bill there. What if true? This poor guy...
Then something spoke to me. And I was instantly convinced. And I said: 
Sorry. Can't help you. And turned and walked away. 

Wondered if I did the right thing. 
 Then about 2 months later, on Broadway, in lower Manhattan by Wall Street, I had just withdrawn some cash at an ATM, when I heard from behind me: 

""Excuse me sir, are you Indian?"""
"HBO had a [series](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/arts/television/hbo-presents-redemption-about-struggling-can-collectors.html) about this. It's not very profitable. 

For many Chinese people, it's also something to do that passes time. Especially if their partners have died/children aren't living near them. It's actually really sad. There have been other [threads about this too](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/3zean4/bottle_ladies_of_nyc/). "
Waiting for my dog to pee so I can go back inside.
"You're in NYC. Everyone of every age does everything. Cept babies, those fuckers still stay on their high horse."
"Fuck plastic bags, we're so far behind other cities. It's awful how many grocery stores just throw them at you here with no care in the world. "

"When you walk by a dry cleaning place and the vent blasts you with that warm, clean linen air."
People hassling you for things while you're trapped with them on the subway. Whether they're panhandlers or those break dancing guys with the boomboxes or anyone else. 
"There is a lot of little shit that annoys me or makes me wonder what the fuck is wrong with people but there are two things that actually piss me off and make me nuts: 

* people who live here who just bitch constantly about everything and never take an advantage of the city (fucking move back to Charlotte if all you’re ever gonna do is whine about how expensive it is and only ever go to the same fucking dicey Irish bar so you can keep banging the married bar back, Christina) and 

* people who move to a neighborhood and never take time trying to appreciate the shit that makes it tick, just look for things analogous to the last place they lived (not to say things should stay the same forever or anything, but at least fucking try a Greek coffee over your Starbucks sparkle frappuwhatever once if you’re gonna move to Astoria)"
I always use plastic bags for small garbage pails in the house.  What do you guys do for bathroom garbage?
"I watched a man on a Coney Island-bound F train eat a six piece KFC box, pick the bones clean, and toss each of them on the floor. 

He was fucking huge and terrifying and absolutely full of chicken so of course I said nothing."
"So, dating doesn’t really work like that. There’s nowhere to go where you can check off all your boxes and just get a serious relationship. Dating is sorting through ten tons of shit trying to find your wallet, you can either have fun with it or you can cry the whole time, but you still have to reach into the pile. Dating in NYC, especially in your early 20’s is extremely shallow as you know, but there’s no shortcuts. You can try joining some meetup groups that interest you or involving yourself in a hobby but any platform like tinder is inherently based on finding casual relationships for the vast majority of users. Not for nothing your attitude is kind of off putting as a guy, it seems like you’re looking to collect a trophy as opposed to actually get to know someone."
"How fucking loud the garbage trucks are

How there are 40 different trash companies that pick up trash on my street bc the trash system in nyc is a relic of the mob era 

How they park in random spots for half an hour at a time to let the trucks churn and compress 

90% of what I hate about the city is trash related tbh"
"Elderly Chinese people who don't speak English, have little job skills, and haven't worked in years aren't getting hired. Even for a minimum wage job. It is not at all lucrative but people collect cans because it's ""easy""(takes no skills) and something is better than nothing.

Its funny because I would guess people who simply beg on the subway/streets make way more. But maybe people who collect cans have too much pride to actually directly approach people so they just collect bottles."
"The entitlement of people who have lived here for a while.  This is not YOUR city. This is OUR city. We all live here together.


  I'm looking at you, neighbor, who is on the community board and is waging war against adding bike corrals because it decreases street parking on your block.  Because, and I quote, ""how would I get to Lincoln Center on a weekend to see a show if I can't have a car?""  You would take the train like the rest of us. It's not my responsibility to subsidize your use of public space for your private consumption.


I'm also looking at you, other neighbor, who owns three cars and uses illegal traffic cones to block spots for yourself.


Additionally, I'm looking at YOU, neighbor, who has cameras all over your building but refuses to share the tape when someone's car gets broken into directly in front of your house and then brags about how ""youve had cameras for years and have always pretended to lose the tape when the cops ask for it."" You have no problem, however, calling the cops when you deem that someone is being too loud or doing something you don't like on their own property.


Also you old neighbor who is complaining endlessly about trees being installed on our block because ""bad people"" can hide behind them. You are going to be way dead by the time that tree is big enough for someone to hide behind.


Again, I say, this is not YOUR city. This is OUR city. So knock it off- sometimes you have to deal with things that don't directly benefit you to be a good neighbor and citizen ."
"Honking is definitely mine. It's not supposed to be an ""I AM ANNOYED"" button, but that's how it is used. Any dumb motherfucker who finds his or herself on Broome Street trying to get to the tunnel at 4:45pm on a Friday afternoon has absolutely no license to use their horn."
"Why do you think you'd be the oldest person at a meetup? People in their 30s (and beyond!) like to do things, too."
"People who move here/visit and act like this is their personal playground and not a real home where actual people live. These are the kind of people that never say hello to neighbors, block the sidewalk, throw loud parties, puke on the street,  pay insane rents because they know it's only temporary for them, put fucking ""love locks"" on the bridge, etc. 

This isn't a movie set, it's a place where people live. Quit acting like it was built exclusively for your personal party montage. "
"lol I love that this posted so quickly. Yeah, that was one hell of a roar! I'm in Sunnyside, Queens.. sounded like it was right on top of us. Didn't see any light though. "
"Jackson Heights - Scrabble was invented there, and if you take a look at the street sign at the intersection of 81st St/35th Ave, the letters are all given their point values from the game (http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/new-scrabble-street-sign-queens-commemorate-birthplace-board-game-article-1.160189)"
"[Try to avoid switching to another turnstile.](https://www.quora.com/New-York-City-Subway-What-is-going-on-when-the-turnstile-says-swipe-card-again-at-this-turnstile)

&gt; It means that you hit the first three sensors, which detected your card and deducted your fare, but you missed the last sensor, which actually opens the gate. (I don't know why there need to be two separate sensors for fare deduction and gate opening, but that's the way it is.) If you swipe again at the same gate and hit the fourth sensor, it'll open. But, if you swipe at a different turnstyle, which doesn't know that it just deducted a fare from your card, then that second turnstyle will deduct another fare (or will exclude you from entering with an unlimited card).

"the guy is from dubai, expensive SUV, has money for a plane ticket here and back but not the $10 for the subway and air train it costs to go to JFK?

"Introduce your self. Get to know the colony. There will be many, many more."
"I just wish we had some kind of force of people, maybe even taxpayer-funded, that would go around and enforce traffic laws. "
That was my commute for two years. Always “train traffic ahead of us.” What train traffic? Why is this mysterious train traffic always ahead of MY train. Why couldn’t *I* be the train traffic ahead of someone else? 🤔

I would like to see more elevators though as people who are disabled or can't get around might feel limited in terms of accessibility. Just because you and I can walk up the stairs doesn't mean someone who isn't able-bodied shouldn't have ways of getting around easier. 
"My last words are going to be: ""Just...fucking...pick...up...after....yourselves...you...fucking...**animals**."""
"As a city work, who drives a 60 ton truck through the streets of Manhattan, I don't understand why this ""double park on alternate side"" nonsense is still permitted. Especially when other people don't move, and I can't squeeze the truck through. They need to tow cars that don't move, it is dangerous if municipal vehicles can't make their way through. 

If I fire truck is responding to an emergency, and can't squeeze past your car, and the idiot who didn't move his, they will make their own path.

I see people sitting in their cars for 2 hours waiting for the street sweeper to come. To me, if you don't use your car everyday, don't own one in NYC. "
"How would they even be a scam??? It's a churro....just ask how much they cost if you're worried about it.

"Lol. What the fuck do you think? 

Sorry, no matter how well dressed, no matter what the story - stranger with a sob story wants money = it's a fucking scam.

"If not wanting to get shanked while riding the train is ""going soft"", then I'm the Pillsbury fucking dough boy.

"If you're going to double parked, you need to be available to move your car. Not everyone can ""plan around"" the idea that an entire neighborhood is going to double park, because there's nowhere to go.


If ASP is from 9:30-11:00 and you need to leave at 10:30, are you supposed to leave your children for an hour a day or get to work late every day? I've also had situations where I had multiple meetings for work--there's no way to plan around it.


Part of the ""unspoken agreement"" is that you are available to move your car."
