"The tunnel between the 1/2/3 and the A/C/E in Penn Station. Mother fuckers, the tunnel is supposed to be fucking bidirectional. I have to throw elbows.    

Actually just the Penn Station area in general. "
Experience subway delays on a less crowded platform at that hour.
"I can’t speak for parents but as a former kid raised in nyc.

elementary school 2 blocks from my house. Middle school 5 blocks. High school by subway.

After school / Hebrew school program picked us up and walked us over (3 blocks). My parents did not pick us up
from school. Either after school
Or Stayed home unsupervised from about age 11.

Sleepaway camp in the summers

Starting riding bus alone at 10, subway alone at 12, daily subway commuter at 14.

NYC kids tend to be very independent. 

I dunno for schoolage + it doesn’t seem complicated. From what I observe toddler years are hardest. "
Ask to be a student of hers and join the studio. Then when she's not looking steal her ceramics and open up a studio next to her and drive her out of business. 
The twisted metal remains of a destroyed umbrella.  Either blowing down a sidewalk or crammed into a corner trash can.  
Because normally there's no traffic going towards the Holland tunnel at 5:00pm on a Thursday. I honk to let others know how surprised I am at this unforeseeable occurrence.
Times Square or the void between FiDi and Chinatown.
"Do I have to pick just one? Let's start with the easy ones:

Times Square, it's ass. There are tourist trappy places in other cities that I still find charming and worth visiting (see: Seattle's Pike Place Market), but Times Square is just an irredeemable mess.

Penn Station and surroundings. It's dirty, run down, has little to no good food, and Penn Station is some kind of hellmouth in and of itself. Every minute I have to spend in that neighborhood is a pain.

Now to some of the less obvious choices...

2nd Ave, between 9th St and 14th St. Aggressive non-stop aggro bro-fest. St. Marks can get pretty bro-y, but that stretch of the Village takes it to a whole new level.

Hell Square on the LES. It's like the above levels of aggro bro-y-ness, but squared. Maybe cubed.

The Queensborough and Midtown Tunnel ramp-areas, I hate it as a pedestrian. Speeding, over-aggressive drivers who will run you down without a second thought. All of the pedestrian crossings in that whole vicinity are death traps.

Varick St on the western side of SoHo. Same reasons as above - death trap for pedestrians caused by the 10,000 cars all trying to squeeze into the Holland. Turned down a job offer near there and this was part of the decision - the fact that the whole neighborhood is super desolate doesn't help."
I think most New Yorkers are OK with the deal that they will have less saved up for retirement as long as they don't have to live west of the hudson anytime soon.
"Take up photography? Taking pics of normally bustling streets when they’re empty can be cool.    


Or you can go watch the fruit wholesale markets set up around Chinatown and the Manhattan bridge.    

Or walk on the Brooklyn bridge and see the sunrise.    

Birdwatching in Central Park.

"My office is on 46th &amp; 6th, in an area I like to call the Bermuda Triangle of tourism - it’s equidistant from Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and Bryant Park.

So yeah, that area."
"When i was homeless in nyc (about a year, 5 years ago), i stayed out of shelters. Life is less harsh than people. I managed find other homeless people and find my way into squat houses. The one issue I see there is that the life style is somewhat luring. It took a lot of self discipline to get a real job and save up for getting a place (which I did, and the people saying is not possible are wrong) instead of wild out with my homeless peers at the time.

There is a place in China town called Streetworks, they help out with showers and supplies, shelter and jobs, they are not the typical homeless shelter, it's chill volunteers. 

Libraries and access to Craigslist is very useful, my first job was a barista. They had no idea I was homeless.

My side gig was collecting free books from Craigslist free section and selling them outside grand central with a ""take something leave something"" sign, people were sometimes generous.

Dumpster diving is very useful, college dorms specifically throw away so much sellable stuff. 

Once you've gathered just about enough money and have an ongoing in flow of it, not much, a thousand will do, start asking people, everyone you know if they know anyone with a place to rent. 

I hope this was somewhat useful, if you have specific questions, feel free to ask.

"The stretch of Northern Blvd between Steinway and Jackson Heights that has like 8 car dealerships.  In particular the huge lot at Major World pisses me off.  A car dealership enclosed with a barbed wire topped fence is the worst possible eyesore in an urban environment.  The stupid Major World commercial that shows us a massive lot with the decidedly vertical skyline nearby is like taunting us with this failure in urbanism.   It should be a fucking densely populated neighborhood of mostly non-drivers, not a a damn parking lot.   "

"Call Con-Ed. Explain discrepancy. Tell them that you just moved in and that this is obviously a mistake. As technician can only get out there after bill is due, ask if you can have any late fees waived until this is checked out. Always be kind and courteous on the phone and it will go a long way. For the most part they do want to help, you just have to be patient and point them towards a solution. You should ask to speak with a manager if the first customer service rep is unable to help. Just tell them you appreciate them trying to help but you think a manager may be able to assist you further. As it is a rental building alternatively I would also mention the history of that apartments electric use. If they see an average before you moved in and it’s way off this may help as well. -This is just my opinion as I have had success dealing with many companies on the phone in the past. I hope this helps!

"I'm a woman and started walking around by myself when I was 10 and taking the subway by myself at 13. So far zero bad or dangerous things have happened. That advice sounds like CYA for them so that on the rare chance that anything happens they told you not to. But statistically you are so much more likely to be raped by one of the men in your group than by some rando on the street.

Generally don't be an idiot-- if there's a dark street without a lot of people and you see one man hanging out there, maybe turn down a different street instead. Don't be drunk with your wallet hanging out where someone can take it. Don't walk in front of moving cars. If you do basic common sense things like that, you should be fine."
"The light turns red up ahead. I roll to a stop. I tighten my hands on the wheel, then stop. Breathe.

I am eight cars back. If we can all just work together this ONE time, *I* will make it through the light. But, there is a moving van. That worries me. Don’t think about it. Maybe 90 seconds pass with me staring at this van. 

Green. Come on, come on, we only have maybe 30 seconds. Sometimes 2 seconds pass for each driver to get off the brakes. Man, forever!

Time slows as it happens. The van’s driver door pops open. His engine is STILL running! What are you doing?!?! Three cars behind me are honking. The driver takes a slow step in the road, my GODDAMN road where I should be driving to get home!!! The light turns red, he walks around the van out of sight. I haven’t moved. 

But we can go around the van. The mini up ahead just jets by the van, great. The next car rolls forward, brake lights on. You going, buddy? Do it! He stops. He honks lightly, tentatively. I push my horn down so hard I swear the steering column moves. The glorious anger shrieks out at him, joining a chorus of motherfuckers just get us out of here!

He rolls forward, he has almost a foot on either side of his car. Why is he even in the city??? He clears the obstacle just as the light turns red AGAIN! Even the SUV with the T plate breezes through. I am through.

We line up. Only two cars ahead of me. I’m gonna make it through this time. I wipe the sweat off the back of my hand on my shirt. I deliberately unclench my teeth. My jaw aches, my knuckles ache. I look at the white crossing signal, it’s my whole field of vision. Just this white walker. Evil bastard. 

Suddenly I snap to and the red don’t cross guy is blinking. The green light is coming, I’m gonna make it! I see a couple walking slowly to the light. She glances at the crossing signal and slows but he doesn’t.

The crossing signal goes solid red. They hesitate. My crossing signal goes white. Here comes the green! People start crossing with the signal, but that’s okay, neither of the cars ahead of me have a blinker on, they haven’t even nudged over to the right. 

1 second passes and the green doesn’t come on. Oh my gods this is one of the new “ped-friendly” lights where they let people go first! Noooo! The couple looks up and sees the light is still red, so they can cross. 1 second passes. The couple starts crossing in front of my lead car. No, no, no! I slap at the horn and they startle visibly. The guy takes a step towards the three cars he’s standing in front of and is bathed in glorious green backlight. 

All the cars in the world are now honking at him but he’s standing his ground for 1... 2... 3 seconds. A hero for sure but he’s a soldier of evil right now. The woman pulls him out of the intersection, laughing. 

My lead car finally rolls forward and immediately turns hard right towards the people crossing, then stops! The ASS of his car is still in our crosswalk! Blocking me and the SUV from passing him! There is a whole goddamn intersection for him to pull forward into and let us pass by.

My horn is on. My horn will always be on. The light turns red. "

"This is a false dichotomy.

Don't renew your lease, because you don't know where you'll end up. You might get a job in another part of the city, or indeed in another city, and want to get something closer to that.

That doesn't mean you have go home though. You should be able to find a flexible month-to-month roommate situation or something if you put your mind to it."

"Not only is it not too much, it is literally illegal. Here is the NYS tenants guide: http://www.ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/publications/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf


You're looking at page 25 for what this is. You must be giving reasonable notice, and if not, can prohibit entry into your unit. You can't outright prohibit it if reasonable notice is given. Now reasonable *is* open to interpretation, although most jurisdictions deem 24 hours notice as reasonable. 

If you are not being given any notice whatsoever, this could turn into a legal battle (that you'd win) but that's really up to you for the trouble. 

If you want to be polite I'd cite the law to them and just ask they give you something. If you WFH just say you want a couple hours or something.

"My kid is not yet in school, so others may be able to answer this more directly....but one big difference is that lots more is walking distance in NYC. We are aiming to put our kid in a preschool that’s a whopping 6 blocks from our apartment, so it won’t take that much extra time to get there (beyond the challenges of getting a child out the door that every parent faces). 

We walk everywhere, and use our stroller a lot. I frequently see preschool aged kids in strollers - and if not, then they have scooters or similar to help them keep up. 

When we do take the subway, I put my toddler in a carrier and that makes the stairs less of an issue (but I only take him on the subway a couple times a month). "

"I love going to places that are normally super packed. That’s when I would run back when I lived in Manhattan. I lived in a pretty touristy area and would run early in the morning (like roll out at 4:45am or so). 

Washington Square Park is neat that early because it’s so serene. In fact, that whole NYU area is STUNNING when it’s empty. 

union square at 5:30 or so is so neat because you can watch the farmers market people load in and it’s so peaceful. 

I’ve not been to Times Square earlier than 7am, but it’s probably the same vibe. 

Bryant Park is also gorgeous before its full of people. I don’t think I’ve been there earlier than 6;45am though. 

Also, finding a Starbucks (I know, I know) and seeing the kind of New Yorkers in there that early is cool. To me, it’s a different slice of life than the 9 to 5 latte crowd. 

Basically: go to touristy spots pre-tourist arrival and see an amazing view of New York. It’s like your own private world. "
This is the most out of touch post I’ve read on this subreddit in a long time. 
"Becoming a police office is now an easy come up like going to the military, i have school mates who became cops and firefighters just because it’s an easy job with good benefits if you do the time, but they don’t enjoy it they are constantly hated, my friends are all minorities and they said the thing that bothers them is when fellow minorities see them and hurl insults at them for being on the force.  But my friends have all changed since becoming cops, they like to run red lights, cut over sidewalks, carry their guns when off duty etc.. they job changes them, between pressure to meet ticket quotas and Sour public relations it’s easy for cops to gang up and form a them vs us mentality thus adding fuel to the already broken system of trust between police and the community.

"I wake up at 5 am every morning so I can go for a run. The city is almost tranquil at that hour. So, I would say just go for a walk, jog, bike ride, etc. I bet riding through the streets of Manhattan when there is no car traffic would be awesome."

"I personally only do it when someone makes a dangerous maneuver (tried to cut someone off, didn't look before changing lanes) or when someone is holding up traffic for a long time (like everyone in front of them moved and they're on their phone, or 2 cab drivers are talking to each other and not moving up.) Even when traffic is at what seems like a standstill, drivers are really irresponsible and careless."
Eh. Fuck 'em.
"When I first moved to nyc, I tried rollerblading through time square. I'm an idiot."
"Honestly just get out of the city. Yes there are social services here, and yes they're super dense. But the cost of living is crazy high. How do you expect to save up for rent or a deposit on a room that's not sketchy and bad for an addict to be around?

Do you have family elsewhere that will take you in? Is there another town or city that you're familiar with that you can transfer to? Can you start applying for jobs in low COL areas and go be homeless there until you've saved for a place?"
