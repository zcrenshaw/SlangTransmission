"A foreign friend was horrified when I ordered something at a food place with ""Lemme get a...,"" but it's the politest phrase I know.

"Fuck outta here.

"I was in a similar position. The utmost boredom killed me; I asked for tasks/initiated new projects but the bosses weren't on the same wavelength. Took online classes relevant to my skills, and applied for a new job. Couldn't be happier!

Edited: I took courses in data sciences and visualization. New job pays 25% more."
I like when deli guys call me boss.  Maybe I shouldn't like that but I do.

"Maybe not the stupidest, but definitely the strangest. 

In college, I had a roommate from Maryland who had never drunk a beer (he was a sophomore). Upon learning this, I offered him a beer. He took a sip, put the bottle down on his desk and declared, “Oh, tastes good.”

Three days later, I’m at my computer, writing a paper. He’s at his desk. Out of the corner of my eye, I see him pick the beer bottle up. He says, “Thanks again for the beer, I’ve really been enjoying it.” And he then proceeds to take another sip. 

I think at some point later that week, he finally finished it. "

"I agree with everyone here saying that in this instance you should have just let them pass. However, as a woman, if I were being sexually harassed on the the train, or if someone were persistently bothering me in some other way and not showing any signs of stopping, I would appreciate someone speaking up in my defense.

"Hold on, I have a list in case I ever decide to get into comedy.

* Set up pot of boiling water \(on open gas burner\), and then left the house to go do laundry 3 blocks away while no one was home. \(I came home before the house burnt down.\)
* Have 5 open jars of marinara sauce in the refrigerator at the same time, because he keeps forgetting if he has any.  Similarly, buys something the rest of us wouldn't touch, forgets its his, takes a picture of it and texts it to me to ask if it's his. 
* Steal fruit off the tree in an abandoned lot and end up in with a sprained ankle
* Lose the remote control for 2 days \(it was in the freezer\)
* Microwave a fork
* A favorite: I come home and the window in the living room is wide open. I close it. A few minutes later roommate comes into the room with a blanket and curls up by the window and is just chilling there all happy. I'm doing stuff, so whatever. About 3 hours later, I say ""what are you doing?"" and he says, ""it's so nice out! I'm sitting by the window and enjoying the breeze."" ""Dude... the window's been closed for over 3 hours."" \- he legit did not notice. "
"I've got some insight into the restaurant supply bit, so maybe that can help? The late 1800s, early 1900s started a peak of Italian immigration. Unlike the Eastern-European Jewish immigration from the 1880s-1900s, this wasn't huge families coming together, it was men. Single men. Saving up to either bring their families or making bank and heading back to Palermo. Did you know about 40% of Italians who came through Ellis went back??

Anyhoo, due to it being a male-dominant migration, and due to some cultural stuff about who cooks in the family, you've got millions of guys coming to America who have NO idea how to feed themselves. Enter the enterprising few cooks who open thousands of Italian restaurants to cater to the hungry Italian worker. These were NOT family joints with tarantellas and ferns, this was cheap eats for broke newcomers. 

Some enterprising Italians figured out it was as lucrative, if not more so, to open restaurant supply stores. These were for massive pasta machines, pizza ovens, pots, pans, stools, tables, all the stuff for an Italian joint. 

After 1924 when we passed laws that forbade any more Italians or Jews entrance into America, the Italians stop coming, the bachelor restaurants slow down. However, as we enter the era of 2nd and 3rd generation Italians entering the middle class, the restaurants become more family oriented. And after WWII, people stop exoticizing Italian food and it sort of becomes ""American"". 

Then, all these Italians who own restaurant supply stores have kids and grandkids who live on Long Island who don't want to run a business in Lower Manhattan, so they start to die off. 

Then it's 1965.

In 1965 we lift that law that had stopped ""non-desirable"" immigration into the US (which included Italians and Jews) and by that time no Italians or Jews WANT to come to the US. But a new group does!

CHINESE!

A group who had been excluded in any major numbers *since 1882*. Who comes? Men. Can they cook? Hell no. The chinese restaurant for the immigrant male is the new boom. And some enterprising Chinese men buy those stores from aging Italians. And here we are.

And restaurants need lighting, so I guess that's why they're there. One bonus for Bowery is that it's accessible by truck, unlike the LES or Little Italy, so it's the place for stores for things that will be delivered somewhere else.

"Sorry to sound incredulous, but you can deal with a single room, dorm style bathrooms, roaches, and what frankly sounds like incredibly shit living conditions but you couldn’t deal with a 40 minute subway commute from, say queens? To me your quality of life sounds atrocious and the trade off of a commute for a real apartment seems like a no brainer."

"I'm a woman and I had a guy standing over me with his hand in his pocket jacking off for about 4 stops until I confronted him to stop. he said ""sorry! he had to pee"" no that was not what was happening. Then I told him to get off at the next stop and he said: ""can you at least appreciate that I apologized?"" WTF no! You want me to thank you? I should have reported him. Anyways not a single person stuck up for me and so I actually left at the next stop because I felt so violated unsafe at that point. If it is a safety issue please stick up even if is just starting a conversation with the person they are harassing to divert the harassment. If it is just begging I think they want the reaction and it's better not to engage. It is shitty though."

"&gt; If it is a safety issue please stick up even if is just starting a conversation 

There was a obviously unstable homeless man following a middle aged woman on the street the other day, yelling at her and being very aggressive. A random businessman on a citibike stopped and just said something to the effect of ""What's going on buddy, are you OK?"", and engaging with him. It gave the woman time to get away.

I really appreciated that he did that and it stuck with me. "

"I take the A every day for work. The A is the worst. One day, an extremely drunk dude yelled at a group of admittedly attractive British(?) girls who got on at JFK. They were very clearly tourists and weren't expecting it and they had the most horrified looks on their faces. I started a conversation with this drunk, crazy dude and held it for 45 minutes until my stop. It was pretty taxing, but I figured I'd rather take the annoyance than them."
"Used to live in one, don't anymore. It's hard to block out the street noise. You'll hear any conversation that happens outside your building. It feels weird that people sometimes loiter right next to your window even if they aren't looking in. It sucks to have to close your blinds all the time and get less light. If you have a bar anywhere near your apartment (within a block) the noise will get really bad at night."
"Man, I want whatever your roommate was smoking.  His version of life seems delightful, carefree and full of adventure. "
"My guess is that the signal failure is screwing up the switches at Queens Plaza, so the M can't cross over there.

If the M can't cross over, then it either has to run express from Jackson Heights (which will congest service even more) or switch to the F at 36th st. 

Since it is running over the F, the F was rerouted to ease switching congestion. It does not have to switch tracks to run via the M in Manhattan"

"I was in a similar position, so I went back to school! I started a full time Masters program that does classes on Saturdays and used my time at my desk to do homework. Worked out perfectly because my homework is pretty much indistinguishable from regular work (unless you're reading over my shoulder) so I actually looked like I was being MORE productive. Plus now I'll have my Masters (two months left to go!) and can transition to a more exciting/better paying job, and I can count on one hand the number of times I did homework at HOME.  Plus people find it REALLY impressive that I managed to juggle both...it's just my little secret that it wasn't much to juggle. "

"Don’t know that there’s a “story.” It’s the lighting district. Just like the flower district or the fashion district. Or the financial district for that matter. At some point in the past one lighting store was successful there, another one moved in to compete, then another. A lot of these stores today are owned by either Chinese, Jewish, or Italian owners and the area happens to be in a place where these immigrant communities resided. If anyone has any other insight I’d love to learn. "

"I had a college housemate who was so sheltered she didn’t know how to do anything.

Her parents would come once a week, take her out to a restaurant and buy five to-go meals at around $20 each so she’d have something to eat until they visited next. This instead of groceries or making EasyMac and grilled cheeses like a normal college student.

We asked her to help out with chores. SHE USED THE BATHROOM SPONGE ON THE DISHES. I still shudder..."
