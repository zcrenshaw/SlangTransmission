"I felt like I was in a rut for a while. Every day was the same commute to work, lunch at the same deli, after-work drinks at the same local bar, talking to the same people, doing the same fucking thing every day.

And I felt like shit about it, because, I mean, this is *New York fucking City*, and literally *everything* is going on out there. And I'm just this fucking goober taking up space on the same damn bar stool, day after day after day.

So one day I went out and bought a paper Rand McNally map of the city, and I got a highlighter. And I started walking. Every night, I'd pull out the map and highlight where I had walked.

When I'd pass a bar that looked interesting, I'd stop in for a drink. When I got hungry, I'd find a place I've never been and try it out. When something looked fun or unique or just, like, whatever, I'd check it out. And I'd go home and highlight everything.

As the map started filling up, it kind of became a game. ""I'm gonna try to cover all of Hell's Kitchen today."" ""There's three blocks in Williamsburg I never hit, let's go take care of them."" ""Shit, I haven't been north of 96th street yet, let's go fuck around in Harlem."" Filling up that map was a *passion*, man.

I subscribed to a bunch of blogs and newsletters and shit. Brooklyn Vegan does a daily 'What's going on today?' post. Brokelyn does a weekly roundup of events. Nonsense list, Oh My Rockness, restaurant maps from Eater, everything. Whenever something looks good, I just *go*. ""Oh, I'm tired today, I wanna just go home and Netflix."" No. Fuck that. Go do a thing. Fill the map. That's become a motto for me.

And you know what? I still don't feel like I'm getting the most out of the city. It's impossible. There's just too much shit. And even when I get that map filled up, I'm gonna have to do it again, because everything's changing all the time.

You could live ten lifetimes in New York and just barely scratch the surface of everything there is to do here. And it can feel really daunting to even try sometimes. But I think the trying is what matters. You'll never live anywhere else like this, where you can just *discover* new shit all the time, every day. Even old shit. Even shit everyone else already knows about and has already gotten sick of. 

Go out and fucking find it. Fill up your map. There's a bar in the Village you've never been to that's gonna become your new go-to spot. There's a taco joint somewhere in Queens that's gonna blow your fucking mind. Your new favorite band might be playing in Bed-Stuy tonight.

Just keep filling the map."
"Most of the bodegas these days are owned by New York's Yemeni community, and they get set up through connections in this network. It was the Koreans before them, and Dominican and Indian community networks have decent portions of the market as well.  Bodega owners know each other, have suppliers and financers and landlords in common, and help each other get started such that you can have a guy with no money and limited English owning his own business soon after his arrival to the USA.   
    
You can set up a bodega on your own just the same as you would any other small business, but you don't see a lot of people outside these insular immigrant networks choosing to do so because the margins on bodegas are razor-thin. You're often making just a few cents per transaction and need to be open insane hours staffing your own store in order to turn a profit, dealing with commercial rent prices growing out of control all over the city. It can be stable income but you'll never ever get rich off it. So why pay 10K in rent each month to sell cans of soda for coins when you could be paying the same to charge hipsters a 1000%  markup on avocado toast?  
    
But the connections that these immigrant communities have forged over the decades drive down costs for everyone, so that they can afford to stay in business and we can still get our $3 BECs. They can find suppliers, employees, landlords, etc willing to work with cash under the table.  They can get informal loans rather than trying to get approved by a bank with no credit history, get cigarettes smuggled from out of state to avoid taxes, find deli workers willing to take less than minimum wage, inherit existing bodegas from one another, get better deals on supplies, learn their way around permits, etc, etc, etc. That shit is essential for keeping the bodegas cheap and in business, and you'd be hard-pressed to stay competitive without those connections.   
  
If you run a bodega the way the government expects you to, you'll have to either charge prices that will send your customers running to the Yemeni on the next corner, or you'll struggle to pay your overhead  as you're making way less money than him."
"This is such a stupid “le wrong generation” post. Yes of course drug fueled debauchery still exists but not on any iconic level like CBGB’s. We don’t know today what will be iconic in 30 years, CBGB’s was just a shitty dive bar with live music until all those bands made it. Look up Max Fish and all the shit that went down there in the early 2000’s and all the major artists that hung out there. There’s somewhere in the city right now with a future Grammy winner doing lines in the bathroom, it’s just that you don’t know them yet."

"I already provided a response in the nyc subreddit, but just reposting my answer here as well. 

&gt;She is afraid to call the cops because he IS a cop. She thinks the other cops will just take his side, and then he will be even angrier and crazier with her for reporting him. She is scared of him (and I am too), so she just does nothing. What should she do? His behavior absolutely isn't okay. For reference, he is with the NYPD.

I know the immediate reaction is to assume other cops will immediately side with another police officer but it is highly unlikely another officer would be dumb enough to risk their career over something like this. Despite what most people think the NYPD takes domestics very seriously, especially involving another officer. Even if the responding officers wanted to look the other way, they can't, procedures are set up to ensure this type of job is handled properly.

Here's what your friend needs to do. Call 911 and say I want to make a report against my ex who is also an NYPD officer. This automatically creates a notification to IAB and a supervisor will have to show up to the job as well. When the police arrive, make sure they take a report for at least harassment. If they are about to leave and a supervisor does not show up, make sure you request one. After the report is taken, call the command that took the report in approx. two days and ask for a report number (you just have to provide your name/dob and they will give you the info). Write that number down and save it. If there's any other unwanted contact, immediately call 911 and document it. Whether or not a crime has been committed depends on additional details and what will happen to the officer will depend on IAB's investigation.

Sorry this happened to your friend and wish her the best of luck."
"A lot of damn misinformation here. I have been working as a paramedic for 12 years in NYC, so I can give you a better idea of how the system works.

The 911 EMS system is run through the FDNY. They set the protocols and standards that need to be followed if you want to work in the 911 system. The participants in the 911 system are as follows:

FDNY 

Hospital based

Private contractors that hospitals hire

So if you see an FDNY ambulance, or an ambulance with a hospital name and an FDNY half moon sticker on the door [like this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/d8/91/82d891a80f58a6f0e78a4e2731fe1ca8.jpg), that means the ambulance is part of the 911 system. 

So when you call 911, the system looks for the closest appropriate 911 ambulance. It doesn't distinguish between hospital based or FDNY. The only distinction made is level of care, which is BLS (EMTs) or ALS (paramedics). Other than that, we operate the same way. The only huge difference is the FDNY ambulance personal get paid by the city, the hospital based ambulances get paid by their respective hospitals. 

Now you do have something called private ambulances. You may have seen them all around, companies like SeniorCare, Midwood, Assist, Instacare, etc. These ambulances are used mainly to move patients from one hospital to another hospital, to bring patients home, or they may do private emergency calls. 

So with the call you described, if that man collapsed on the street, and one of the private ambulances witnessed it, they are allowed to take that patient. It isn't a turf thing, it's just that they were the first ones there. I find it hard to believe they told another ambulance to stay away, but again, I wasn't there. It isn't a money issue, it's just the patient was already being treated by a crew. What i would be itnerested to know is if you saw a ""private"" ambulance, meaning one of those transport ones, or if it was a hospital based ambulance, which means it was activated through the 911 system. Regardless of where the ambulance comes from, all cardiac arrests receive two types of ambulances, the ALS one (paramedics) and BLS ones (EMTs). So if they had the appropriate levels on scene, there is no need for additional ambulances. It just creates a ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" situation. "
Because we live in a city with 8+ million people and not a quiet suburb.
"This is an excellent response but you did forget the most important step in opening up a bodega in NYC; obtaining a bodega cat. As I'm sure you know, one does not simply just go out and buy a random cat. No sir, the bodega cat must choose you. It's a sacred and ancient ritual that is shrouded in mystery and health code violations. "
"Are you staying in Times Square/Midtown? I work at a bar in Times Square, that I admit is pretty shitty, but Brazilians have always been the nicest guests. If you're around with nothing to do early evening friday I'll buy y'all a drink at my bar. "

Objectively, I think I'd be hard-pressed to really argue that the B is the worst train -- it's not nearly as crowded or awful as some, at least most of the time.  But, for me, it's the worst. "

There is no tattoo anyone could get to commemorate a vacation that I wouldn’t cast some shade on. 
"New York is a city of extremes, both good and bad. 

Want food? Every cuisine is at your fingertips, whether you want upscale dining or a greasy finger joint. Want entertainment? Here's Broadway, here's every single show from famous performers in MSG down to the no-name up-and-comer gigs in the boroughs. Want a park? Here's Central freakin' Park, or Prospect Park, or Corona Park, or Van Cortlandt Park. Classic architecture, check. Famous landmarks, check check. Great job opportunities and high salaries, check check check.

Want to go somewhere? Public transit can get you anywhere within the city. Every major airline goes to one of the two international airports, either one half an hour away. America's only functional rail corridor goes right through New York. Whether you want to go to another big city (Boston, Philadelphia, DC) or a relaxed getaway (Montauk, Martha's Vineyard, Asbury Park) it's easy to get there.

Hate crowds? Every day, over 4 million people squeeze into Manhattan on its narrow roads, decrepit subways, and sidewalks choked with garbage bags. Tourists halt every other step to take photos. The extreme driving style of taxi drivers makes traffic even worse than it already is. Hawkers will try to sell you something, no sidewalk or subway car is safe from homeless people and ""showtime"" performers showing up at any moment. Say goodbye to sunlight, as Midtown high rises block the sky and channel chilling winds that would make Chicago jealous into the streets.

Your commute is almost guaranteed to be long, since the most coveted neighbourhoods haven't built a new affordable apartment building since 1963. The apartments that *do* get built are snapped up by Chinese and Arab businessmen as investments, driving up the price. Decent living spaces dwindle as they are cut up into absurdly shaped studios. Every block has at least one ""for lease"" sign that's been there for months if not years, as businesses fail to keep up with rising rents. 

New York is the best, worst city."
You must speak up. 
"NYC 911 Paramedic here, I work for a hospital under FDNY in the 911 system.

You can request to go to a hospital within 10 minutes of the nearest hospital and the crew is able to grant that request on their own without any additional input, provided that you are stable.

If the hospital you would like to be transported to is more than the time to the nearest hospital plus an additional ten minutes away, the crew has to call FDNY’s on-call doctor for permission. Ordinarily, this permission requires some articulable reason why a nearer hospital is unsuitable. In all cases it is at the discretion of the FDNY doctor and the FDNY operations people based on the overall needs of the city, taking in mind that the longer transport will take the ambulance out of service for a longer time than it would usually take to transport a patient to the hospital.

To deal with your specific hypotheticals:

1. Knowing a member of staff is really not a good enough reason to go to a distant hospital, to be kind of blunt about it. You have to realize that the ambulance that would take you is also responsible to respond to life-threatening events in a particular area. Taking the ambulance out of service for a protracted transport may not be doing the greatest good for the most people. If the patient’s condition warrants transport to a trauma center, they should go to the nearest trauma center.

2. A stroke patient needs to go to the nearest stroke center. All NYC 911 EMTs and Paramedics know this and we have a computer that tells us which stroke center is closest. This is pretty much non-negotiable. Bypassing the nearest stroke center for one that the patient or family subjectively prefers could result in the patient having a worse outcome due to delaying treatment. Typically a stroke patient will not have the decisional capacity to override this.

Hopefully that clears things up!"

"NYC is a 24/7 city with bars and restaurants always opening, means that we have more access to alcohol than many other places. 

The fact that you can easily live in NYC without a car (and in fact, many times it's preferable) can definitely have an impact on drinking. Excellent bars abound ranging from neighborhood dives, to cheap and abundant happy hours, to one-of-a-kind speakeasies serving up unique cocktails. It's hard not to get caught up in it all sometimes...

My BF and I are both whiskey enthusiasts and enjoy going out. I'd say we probably drink about 3-4 nights a week and tend to go pretty hard on a Friday or Saturday. We both have stable jobs that we're good at and it doesn't impact our productivity or mood, but as I get older, I do find that hangovers are worse than my early 20s, which makes me inclined to slow down a bit.

Then you have to figure for maybe 80% of buildings, there is a retail storefront on the ground level, and some have bars or stores in basements and on the first few floors.

"My career opportunities here are pretty unparalleled aside from LA, Vancouver, and London.

I definitely veg a lot at home, but I make it out to crazy and unique events, some insane parties, I love finding unique bars and restaurants, visiting the museums and hanging out in some pretty cool spaces.

But I do those things at my own speed. I don’t feel this weird pressure to ALWAYS be taking advantage of the crazy stuff going on in the city. Like dude, if I wanna spend the weekend in bed just napping, eating Korean take out and watching Netflix, you better believe I’m gonna do that with no shame. All that stuff will still be there.

"Really, really depends on where in Brooklyn.  Street parking is possible in some places, impossible in others.  You can plan on $400-500 for a monthly garage.

If you do wind up in a neighborhood with street parking, keep in mind NYC isn't a ""park it and forget it"" town.  You'll have to move it at least once per week during the week for street cleaning.

I'd encourage you to consider selling the car and grabbing a Zipcar or Car2Go membership if you want to zip out for the weekend.  

Most people don't have cars here not out some sense of environmental insanity, but because you truly don't need it.  You can have your groceries delivered to your door, you can take an Uber to Costco or Target.  If you're making enough money where $400 a month for parking doesn't bother you, good on you, but there are cheaper and less difficult ways to accomplish what you're trying to do."

You do realize that ""crackheads, criminals"" are the *least* likely to make it a homeless shelter in the first place; that's why you are most likely to see them on the streets.  Most people who stay in homeless shelters have full time jobs and families they are trying to support, but can't afford the cost of living in this city.  They are staying at shelters because they need a *safe* place to spend the night, not a place full of crime and drugs.  You are entitled to your conservative ideals, but let's use some rational thinking here.  My recommendation to you is to go educate yourself about homelessness in America and do some volunteer work instead of complaining about poor people ruining your ritzy neighborhood, which by the way is incredibly unlikely in NYC.

 No. Portland is a “cool” city.  Pittsburgh is a “cool” city. NYC is the motherfucking planet.  Sure I eat food that would be considered novel in most places. Sure I go to world class museums and lose myself in the vastness of human knowledge and achievement.  But even if I were too busy or broke to enjoy those things it wouldn’t matter much because the real value of the NYC experience is the beautiful chaos and the most comprehensive cross section of humanity any city could offer. Just riding public transit and walking around is energizing and inspirational.
