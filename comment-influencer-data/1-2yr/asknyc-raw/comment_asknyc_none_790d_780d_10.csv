"I think everyone's definition of dangerous and normal is different. I don't consider being offered weed as dangerous, or offended by a homeless beggar. If someone was to demand my wallet, then it's a different story."
"You were in a NYC park at 1am... what did you expect?

It doesnt matter how wealthy the area is, going to a park that late at night is gonna be filled with the people you described. did you think it would be some beautiful late night landscape full of beautiful people?

Greenwich village is super safe, youre an idiot. Just stay out of dark parks that late and youll be fine and see the Greenwich village that you love so much. "
Who the fuck knows?  It's not like there's a fucking Gallup Poll.
"It is mostly a joke. Except for the part that if you live in NJ you'll have a hard time getting people to come to your place (one night stands or best friends, just not easy to do).

It usually really boils down to the commute and the extra cost of NJ. Queens to the Bronx to Brooklyn to Manhattan to Staten Island is all one transit system. It's all in my unlimited. It's all covered by yellows. The second you start going to NJ, you're talking two transit systems and a heft hike in how much a cab home costs. "
Greenwich Village is definitely one of the safer neighborhoods. I think it's more so that you were in a park late at night - you could be in one of the safest neighborhoods in the world and I still wouldn't do that.
"OP - My husband is a Boston fine dining server than transitioned to NYC fine dining. If you can let me know where you worked in Boston via PM, I might be able to see if he knows any chefs who know those places and what kitchens they're in - they'll talk to front of house.

Also, though, like legit get out of American wine. No one gives AF about US wine. Learn your French, Spanish, sure, but get on South American and African wines like yesterday."
"^^ This.  Especially since you're around NYU and half the folks at the park at college students many of whom some weed.  

Also.... its weed.  Not like they offered cocaine. "
"Totally normal to hit up bars alone here. It takes about a year to develop social networks in a new city, so don't feel bad that you haven't made friends in a month. "
Knicks starting five should have room for you. 
A townhouse in the West village with a garage? Yes thank you. 
"Avoid people who give you stuff on the street (possibly excluding free food/drinks from those little pop-up stands).

Especially be aware of:

* Guys giving out music / mix CDs. They might come across as friendly, offer an autograph. Then they try to force the CD on you, saying they can't sell it normally now because its got your name on it. Then a bunch of their friends suddenly show up around you trying to 'politely' convince you to buy. I see this just about every day at Times Square, they know to look for tourists.
* [The fake buddhists](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/nyregion/fake-monks-begging-buddhist.html). They give out these little fake looking golden tokens then try to press you for donations. Though recently around Times Square I've noticed they also try to get contact information (saw a guy getting a lady to write down an e-mail). Not sure what they'd do for that - solicit e-donations? Not a bad trick, websites can be made to look legitimate

Also, don't give money to people on the subway. Just don't - especially people panhandling. The subway is not a form of social support. That goes double for entertainers - if you want to see street acrobats, head to Union Square, Washington Square Park, Herald Square, Times Square, or just about any other major tourist area. You'll find them there. Don't give them money for doing flips in the middle of the subway car. 

On a less grifter-focused note, if you see a restaurant chain you recognize from your home town/city, keep walking. You can get that food back home and it will probably taste better. Eat at small shops, carts, hole-in-the-walls, etc. Take chances. Eat tasty food. Get diarrhea. It will probably be fine."
"Alone and undisturbed in a room with a free piano, no. 

This is my suggestion.

Go around to nursing homes. Ask to speak to the recreation director/co-ordinator. Tell them you miss your grandparents and want to entertain seniors. 

Many nursing homes have pianos. Some nicer than others.

Offer to entertain seniors, for free, play your piano, entertain some nursing home patients, the nursing home gets to demonstrate bona-fide recreation for when they get audited by regulators. 

win-win-win

The nicest pianos I have seen are at Menorah Home in Manhattan Beach Brooklyn, Mary Manning Walsh, Upper East Side, Manhattan and Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center, Fifth Ave in Spanish Harlem.

Looks to be Steinway Baby Grands just sitting around.

Might need to be tuned..."
"It is super unfair for both you and the landlord. I wouldn't say it is common but it happens. They can't legally get her out in any kind of timeframe that would be useful to you. It sounds like your broker is trying to do as best for you as they can (refunding all your fees). Were there any credit check fees that you had to pay? You should request those too.

Yes, you'll need to just look for a different apartment. 

"
"Mid 20's, single: this is the time you should be embracing the fact you live in nyc, not running away from it."

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_of_the_World_from_9th_Avenue

NY has way higher income tax, NJ has way higher property tax.  Both let you trade $/sqft for soul crushing boredom if you so desire.  

At least it's not Staten Island."
"NYU Law alum here.  There's probably not a safer place with 10 bazillion bars in a square mile radius on the entire planet than Greenwich Village, even at 1am.  The homeless people won't bother you, nor will the ""coke, weed"" guys on Bleecker Street.  Just keep it pushing."
I'd probably start with the City of New York museum and the transit museum if you haven't been to those yet. 
"I've had nothing but bad and confusing experiences with brokers who I've entrusted to find apartments for me. More or less similar to what you've described. 

I have however had good experiences with brokers I got in touch with about specific apartments I found on streeteasy. Email them, they respond quickly, and will meet you directly at the apartment you've already decided is worth a look.

"
"Went to a happy hour alone last week. Sat at the bar and journalled. It's 100% normal here.

If you're looking for more friends, why not join us at Peculiar Pub tomorrow? 6-??am.

It's r/NYCMeetups weekly happy hour. I just hit my one year a few weeks ago. We're a v friendly bunch."
"Did you move here straight out of college? Part of me wonders if the ""making friends in New York is hard"" thing is actually about New York or if it's about people moving here after college and discovering that making friends is a lot harder when you're not in school. 

I happened to land a job in Austin when I was finishing grad school and actually had a much harder time there socially--I think the car culture made it feel particularly isolating, particularly as someone who had lived without a car their entire adult life. That's not to say that you would feel the same--I moved to Austin thinking it was a temporary stop in my life, which definitely made things harder--but, at the same time, Austin is not all that it's cracked up to be."
"It has to do with the fact that many homeless people suffer from untreated mental illness. Then compound that with alcohol and drugs and a generally isolating and unforgiving life on the streets. This is not unique to NY but often found more in urban areas, possibly just do to population density. I guarantee you, you have people like this in Texas."
"Paying money to go up tall buildings. There are rooftop bars you can go to for a great view and only pay for drinks, not an elevator ride. "
I think they were just going along with title
I think the trick is that you sprinkle a whole bag of bird seed around your bench first so that you're protected by pigeons until you wake up.
"It's a mid-tier holiday honoring the American labor movement (the people who fought for unions and 5-day workweeks and such). It's often considered the holiday marking the ""end of summer.""

The majority of tourist attractions and restaurants will be open as usual. Shops will be celebrating worker's rights by having Labor Day sales, forcing all their minimum-wage, non-unioned employees to be at work.

Probably the only difference you'll notice is that all the tourist attractions will be busy for a Monday, with a lot of people having the day off. Book whatever you can in advance. "
"Did it once. It was a mistake. I came back. There are lots of things to the city beside it being ""a 24/7 city."" There's just more of everything and more diversity to the offerings. Austin is fine, but it's not culturally comparable to NYC. 

That said, I also don't want kids, so my calculus is different."
"Seems pretty obvious but: step to the side to let people off the subway before trying to get on. Honestly, even locals don't do that shit enough.
"
Because everything about NYC apartment hunting is awful and makes zero sense. I seriously cannot believe that these people expect me to pay 15% of a years rent to show me an apartment that I found on a website. 
Landlord doesn't give a shit about your relationship status. He cares about you guys mailing checks before the first of each month
mostly for bike lanes....dont cross the street without looking to see if there's a bicycle coming
"If you're dressed well, they won't bother you in hotel lobbies. I've slept in them before for 10-15 minute naps on their big comfy chairs."
"&gt;Should I drive, train?

Train: Why are you asking me? I'm a train."
"The TV, the pool table, the dart board, your drink, the tip of your nose, your wallet, the bleak darkness of this neverending existence."
"I'll tell you which station doesn't have AC- Herald Square, lawd have mercy in 85+ degrees"
I'm not sure what the sentiment is behind that statement but I don't just want to be a server I want to be a Captain/Sommelier. That's not something that takes little effort or lack of forethought and planning.
"I know how you feel (at times), but as you can see this sub isn't the best place to come for sympathy."
"Cigarettes, drugs...that and crying uses up a lot more calories than one would think."
The easy chairs in the furniture department at Macy's.
"Washington square park is notorious for having sketchy people sell you ""drugs"". 

1am in any town will have weirdos out, unless you're in the prime tourist spot like timessquare. and even then...

Greenwich village is not dangerous. Go back during regular hours. "
"Once you get a girlfriend, you can split the rent again. "
"Hate to burst your bubble, but marijuana is not an antidepressant but acts as a major depressant, and despite making you feel better at the moment (because you're numbing your feelings), using an avoidance strategy is only going to exacerbate any underlying depression.  Any reputable doctor would tell you to quit smoking and take up exercise, and maybe prescribe a clinically effective antidrepressant, but weed is not the solution here.  Good luck"
The transit museum is amazing. Be prepared to spend hours and read everything. It's worth it. 
"It's difficult to see so many people use a place that you want to make your lifelong home as a temporary stop off in life. They often work decent paying jobs, live in hot neighborhoods and are part of the reason that rent climbs precipitously and are a big factor in gentrification. 

While I understand that the hostile reaction is maybe not called for against you personally, I think it's telling that you didn't realize that this might be met with a ""well, then leave"" kind of response. The sub doesn't encourage people to move here; it won't encourage you to stay, either. "
"If he told you before you rented it that AC was not allowed you should abide by your agreement.

Not to mention if there is a rider in your least stating this you HAVE to abide by it."
"Andrew Cuomo has been waving his dick around NYC ever since DiBlasio took office.

There are now [over 200 NY Troopers in NYC and a new class is expected to double that](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/nyregion/cuomos-deployment-of-troopers-in-city-frustrates-police-leaders.html). They're all over the highways, handing out traffic tickets and an unprecedented rate. They're also invading the bridges, tunnels and airports, although they lack the security clearance to actually cross the TSA points, something the Port Authority Police can do.

&gt;At airports, troopers do not have the federal certification necessary to pass beyond checkpoints into secure areas. In one episode at Kennedy Airport this spring, a law enforcement official briefed on it said, supervisors from the Transportation Security Administration and the Port Authority Police Department had to ask two troopers to leave the secure area after they responded to a call of a traveler with a gun and went past the checkpoint.


To me, its a stupid waste of money intrusion, and nothing more than a political showdown between NY and Albany. There are already over 36,000 NYPD officers, there is the PAPD, MTA PD, Amtrak PD, Triborough B&amp;T PD, ... Why are we spending state money and resources to increase enforcement in the most heavily policed part of the state, while other areas of the station are grossly under-served."
"OP, ignore this person. They don't know what they're talking about. They're the worst person on this sub.

Starving artists with shit jobs make the hustle work still. This person is just trying to divert people moving here so they can be all high and mighty for ""making it."" 

Most restaurants don't give a shit whether you want to start your career as a dishwasher and move up. Nor do they care why you want the money. As long as you show up on time, mostly sober, and aren't terrible at your job, you'll do fine. "
Drunk Shakespeare and Manhattan by Sail were the last two I used. Thoroughly enjoyed both.
"If the screws are stripped, you can file a channel to unscrew them with a flathead screwdriver. It works quicker with a Dremel tool. 
"
"Everyone I know who lives in jersey also sticks basically to new jersey and manhattan, and the social scene, while existing, isn't as plentiful. Which is fine I guess, if you just commute to work and home. But if you want to like go to cheap shows, or have friends in the city who are in their twenties, you kinda have to travel into Brooklyn, queens, uptown or the Bronx. At least for my social circle and work place, the perspective is that people in NJ are either lame, spoiled suburbanites living with their parents, or squares more obsessed with saving $200 because they HAVE to get a nice apartment instead of like being cool millennials subsisting on the edge."
"&gt;I'm really interested in going to law school at NYU

NYU Law is one of the hardest schools to get into.  If you're put off by people selling ""weed"" at 1am, then you might not be cut out for law school."
"Money needs to come from somewhere... like the MTA budget Cuomo has consistently shitted on. 

You know like reducing mta budget by $65 million (breaking his promise to the people of New York) while allocating $564 million to the Van Wyck expressway. "
"So you want to be in Manhattan, under 127th St, in a rent stabilized apartment, no roommates, 2.3k, ""a ton of trees/greenery"", multiple subway lines, not too far from Herald Square, and not open to FiDi, Midtown West or East Harlem?

Honestly, it sounds like what you need is a broker who will give a fuck and hustle for you and even then, you might not find what you're looking for. That's a pretty extensive list of demands. "
"As mentioned, the one you're thinking of is probably 6 1/2 Ave, which runs between 54th and 57th Sts. 

This is provided through a city program called POPS (Privately Owned Public Space) which provides building developers a bonus to build more floor area than allowed by the Zoning Code if they provide some sort of public space at ground level. You can find a map of every [POPS here](https://apops.mas.org/find-a-pops/). 

While some of these are pretty cool (the [Elevated Acre at 55 Water Street](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7031584,-74.0085715,3a,75y,334.94h,96.5t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-hY-3HdxHyPQ%2FV_aUDHCYxrI%2FAAAAAAAABP0%2FEtiGjca3x5ksoQz617_6IlvtW8JepEqowCLIB!2e4!3e11!6s%2F%2Flh6.googleusercontent.com%2F-hY-3HdxHyPQ%2FV_aUDHCYxrI%2FAAAAAAAABP0%2FEtiGjca3x5ksoQz617_6IlvtW8JepEqowCLIB%2Fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya51.567642-ro-0-fo100%2F!7i9728!8i4114) and the [Ford Foundation atrium](https://tclf.org/sites/default/files/microsites/kiley-legacy/assets/FordFoundation/Ford_Foundation_slide2.jpg) come to mind), the reality is that a lot of these so-called 'public spaces' are no more than sad concrete benches in front of a tall office building, maybe a planter with a bush or two. Sometimes they end up being a featureless paved plaza that for some reason was allowed the distinction of being a 'public space' when in reality it's just a slightly wider-than-normal portion of sidewalk. "
Le Poisson Rouge has a dedicated 90s night every Friday with a cover band and a lot of people going all out and dressing up.  Never been but friends love it.
