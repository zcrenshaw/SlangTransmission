"Once you're into NYC you won't need to worry in the slightest -- we are very used to Muslim people, and headscarfs won't even get you a second glance.  (A burqa might, but even then no one would bother you.). This is an international city -- made up of people from hundreds of countries -- and you're absolutely as welcome here as anyone else would be.  

This is true, moreover, notwithstanding that one particular asshole who purported to be Muslim decided to commit a horrible crime.  We know the difference between Muslims and criminals -- even when the criminals claim to speak for Muslims.  Our strength is that we do not respond to such hatred by hating Muslims -- which is what the terrorists want us to do -- but only by hating criminals.  So you're entirely welcome. 

But, just know coming in that our border patrol is made up entirely of power hungry little assholes and that they make coming into America an unpleasant experience for everyone -- but particularly if you're Muslim.  They may well be rude to you, and if that deters you from visiting then... I don't know what to say other than that I'm ashamed of us for being so inhospitable at our borders."
"Please come &amp; enjoy yourselves.  The locals will only find fault with you if you walk slowly as a group across a sidewalk and slow us down.  If you need to stop and consult your phone please move to the right out of the flow of foot traffic. 

There’s a large Muslim community here that is simply part of the fabric of city, neighborhood life.  "
"Just me giving wrong directions, and then realizing it 30 seconds after they walk away, and just going ""Ah, well. They'll figure it out eventually..."""
"It’s funny. With Marine Le Pen, the “burkini ban,” etc., I can imagine a Muslim New Yorker asking the exact same question about a visit to France.

My personal perception is that anti-Islamic sentiment is probably higher in France (on average) than it is in NYC. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims live in New York City, and go about their business every day. You will see many women wearing hijabs, and nobody will bat an eye. "
"&gt; For good chicken, Popeyes.

Where's the lie?"
"i don’t think the majority of the gentrifying population knows much about queens since it’s not “cool” except for astoria and maybe LIC. i’ve lived in sunnyside for a while and when i tell people where i live, they more often than not react with confusion. i mean i’m fine with it, stay away and keep my rent down.

also JH looks like it’s a quick ride on the subway to the city but the 7 and EFMR are often in varying states of fucked, at least in the mornings during rush hour. so your quick commute, easily located off 5 major train lines, can blow up into an hour plus ordeal. regularly. "
Check out Times Square on New Year's Eve.
"""Just take a cab everywhere, it's easier than the subway.""  Not necessarily, and also you're gonna pay a shit-ton more that way."
I have almost have the exact commute time. Podcasts are good for this. You'll learn a lot of things.
"There are 8.5 million people who live here, and some of them are assholes, so I can't promise that no one will say anything mean to you or your mom. But it's definitely not the dominant attitude, any given train car will have people wearing all kinds of different things and no one cares "
"Eisenberg’s near the flatiron. 
Just order what looks good. Won’t blow your socks off but you feel a part of the city just eating here. So old school you can’t help but imagine this place 50 years back and feel the history. "
"Whatever you think, you did already a lot more than most of the people out there.... "
"Eh, I get wanting to see it once. Hell, every now and again on a real late night out, I'll pop off the subway if I'm passing through. It's impressive in its spectacle, but the NYE is beyond the pale. "
"It's pretty much universally illegal, but if you've spent any time in the resturant industry you know that legality is a meaningless term. If you want to peruse this till the end, contact the department of labor. If you expect to make an anonymous complaint and see change then don't hold your breath."
"I was a regular at both French Roast and Angelica's Kitchen. The best thing is not to get attached to anything in this damn city. 

Ok, I'm done being bitter."
Illegal wage theft 
"No.

Well, maybe on the FDR. It might be unsafe to walk on there."
"I'm a college student, so I'm pretty cheap.

$5 gets you a plate of heavenly peanut butter sauce noodles and ten steamed dumplings at Shu Jiao Fu Zhou. It's a hefty amount of food for a low price. Plus, those noodles alone are to die for."
"No, but in 1993 I heard a train conductor say over the intercom ""Stand clear of the closing doors you whores""."
No idea. This seems like it'll create a huge void for local news in the city.
"I hesitate to comment further on something I am not personally familiar with, especially because domestic abuse situations are very delicate, but I do want to say thank you for standing up for her!"
"Generally, I think it's silly to suggest going to the far outer-boroughs unless someone has a very specific interest in something worth their while. Why would most tourists want to ""See how real New Yorkers live""? 

One example that I see all the time is locals suggesting people go to Flushing for Chinese food. If you're a big foodie maybe, otherwise it's awful advice for a run of the mill tourist. "
DNAinfo and Gothamist voted to join the writers' union last week and rich dude decided to close shop in reaction to it.
"Yeah, I mean, Manhattan people won't even go visit you if you live in Queens unless they really really like you."
Waiting for alternate side to change.
Also stand on the right of the escalator if you don't want to walk up it please. Although even the people who live here don't do that...
Walking around mainly.
"I'd say next time, take a picture at the very least. It sounds immature and annoying for you to do, and it might not seem like you're helping much at the time, but a picture can go a long way when they're trying to find these people. I would call the police as well, and maybe even next time, if it's as obvious as this that it's abuse, then try to get to the conductor. "
"Jesus Christ, DNAinfo had an amazing wealth of knowledge. Fuck off. I don’t need these sites to know the weather or that there was, in fact, a terrorist attack on Tuesday."
Absolute Bagels
Easier because there are so many people but harder because there are so many people 
"your sentiments are shared! nye aside, i **really** hate seeing people telling first time visitors to avoid times square completely. just because some are 'too cool' for it doesn't mean that it hasn't been the nexus of city tourism for more than a century. i will agree that one shouldn't make a day of the area but it's within walking distance of everything else in midtown and definitely worth a visit. "
Go to a Key Me kiosk. Machines won’t ask questions ;)

"Jackson Heights in its current state is a decent neighborhood but doesn't yet have a lot of the conveniences or amenities that a lot of people are looking for, besides the affordability and Manhattan proximity.

Just a quick list off the top of my head:

* Food options are still pretty limited.  You have your share of Middle Eastern/South Asian and Hispanic foods but you don't have much variety past that as of today.
* Shopping options.  There are small clusters of decent grocery stores near the subway stops (74th/82nd Sts), but much of the other stores in the area are 99 cent shops, pharmacies, check cashing shops, and other places that you would think aren't needed on a regular basis.  There are many theories ranging from price fixing by landlords, to money laundering, to explain why outside business has such a hard time breaking into the neighborhood.
* Recreation/entertainment.  There used to be a really shitty movie theater on 82nd/Roosevelt that has since closed.  There are one or two small and underwhelming gyms.  The bar scene is a bit limited.  
* The housing situation.  Due to restrictions within the historical district, you're pretty much limited to pre-war buildings close to the subway, or small single/multi-family houses further from the subway north of Northern or south of Roosevelt towards Woodside/Elmhurst.  Not a dealbreaker for some, but others will pay a premium for creature comforts like elevators, doormen, fitness centers, central HVAC etc. - things you can find in neighborhoods both closer to the city and even further from it (newer buildings in Rego Park/Forest Hills for example)."
"""Oh take the pedi-cabs, theyre an awesome way to experience the city and take in the views, all for cheap!"""
"I had a friend who ran almost the whole thing without a bib, they eventually kicked him out just before central park. 

I think he was originally just trying to cross the street. "
"You ask the upstairs tenant nicely if they can put down some rugs. That is the typical solution here. 

You say you're moving from overseas - have you lived in a prewar walk-up in NYC before? This is extremely normal."
"To a really nice couple from Minnesota: Walk to the front of the line at the Wythe Hotel rooftop bar and say ""Hot tub Tony says it's cool""

I don't know why I did that."
"La Bonbonniere. Ancient, tiny, hole in the wall cash only diner, which is a nice change of pace from usual West Village fare"
"I feel just as sick and crap about the fact that people die on our streets almost every day and barely receive media/politicians' attention.

I'm angry. [Eric Ng, only 22 years old, was killed by a drunk driver driving on the same greenway in 2006](http://gothamist.com/2006/12/02/drunk_driver_ki.php). Advocates have been pushing for more pedestrian and cyclist protection there (and elsewhere in the city), and the city has been way, way too slow to respond. Pedestrians and cyclists are treated like roadkill here. Acts of terror or otherwise, we're incredibly vulnerable and our officials are not doing enough to keep us safe.  

I hope the fact that this incident seems to have been terrorism does not distract us from the fact that people are dying and getting seriously hurt on NYC streets every day, and we must demand that our electeds do more to protect us, terror or not. Putting in more bollards and restricting truck/vehicle traffic in the city can help protect us from terrorists and everyday distracted/aggressive drivers alike.

Edit: Many Greenway users have seen motorists driving on it. People routinely drive in what should be protected, safe pedestrian areas: some examples are people setting up private BBQs in parks (often see in Queensbridge Park and in East River Park in the EV). Some have reported this to NYPD or Parks Police and got a shrug in return. See something say something my ass."
bitch i love me some popeyes
"I've done this sooo many times. 

Someone corrected me once when I was walking home from duane reade with a 100 something fever and all I could say was, yea, I'm wrong, I'm really sick"
