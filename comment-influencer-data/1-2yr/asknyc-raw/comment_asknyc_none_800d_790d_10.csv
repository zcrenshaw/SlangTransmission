"Ignore it unless it gets physical that's my rule. As long as the motherfucker is not touching me he can go on as long as he wants.

On Wednesday I saw this middle age white lady on the train, there was a black man yelling all sorts of shit at her. She kept reading her book like nothing, when he left she looked up, saw my face of fucking rage and horror - bc god knows I fucking hate these crazies - and winked. "
"New Yorkers aren't ""mean."" The way we survive and maintain sanity is by rigorously respecting others' personal and mental space. We don't indulge in pointless chitchat or mindless small talk much. We have a pretty strict set of rules around personal space and subway/sidewalk etiquette, so if you violate one of those, you might get snapped at. 

Nevertheless, anyone in need of help--lost, sick or hurt, whatever--will find plenty of people stop to assist. We get to know the people who work in the bodegas and food shops we frequent, and will chat with them a little. It's not an unfriendly place by any means, it's just that the social language and customs are different--more brusque, more to the point, more concise. 

On a broader scale, I feel more connected to this neighborhood and this city than anyplace else I've ever lived. My city councilperson knows me by name, we have lots of city services that our huge economies of scale can provide, my kids are in really good public schools--life here is very good. "
"Yes but it isn't seasonal, misery is the baseline emotion of anyone who loves it here."
What a champ. She's a true NYer.
"The people who claim nyers are mean are the same people blocking store entrances, shoving their way into subways when people are trying to get out, blocking escalators, causing human pileups on sidewalks, and walking 1/3rd the pace of everyone else around them. Tourists come here and expect us to accomidate all of them, like we don't have to live and work here. This isn't disney world, yet they walk around like everyone is on a leisure vacation. If you blend in, nyers are more often than not willing to help you out quickly. Yes some are cunts for no reason, but most of us are normal people with shit to do"
"You should ask. It's totally normal for people in their 30s and 40s to have roommates here. If having a roommate is a deal breaker for you, you need to ask, as it's not a normal deal breaker here. Living in a basement is also not a standard deal breaker here.

That said, a dirty apartment not being a good sign is pretty fair, as is the bug issue (provided they're not actively working to fix it)."
"I'd take to wherever they are staying and scout the internet for coupon codes for delivery. Then order the cheapest Chinese food around. 

Eat it, save half, eat the rest for dinner. Then play video games. Then cry about paying rent the next morning in the mail. Check is stained with tear. That was your last check. Go to your bank branch 10 blocks away. Find out they charge too much for a page of checks. "
"I'm surprised you didn't try harder to make sure the money was out of your account with each check. If I noticed she wasn't cashing them, I would have hounded her, then started depositing the money to a separate account in case something like this happened"
"Eh. I'd argue that someone that randomly tells strangers to move across the world based on physical attributes is pretty mentally ill or stupid, and should be treated as such. 

He did not threaten her, he did not touch her. I'm not minimizing the *emotional* toll this kind of verbal assault takes. I assure you as a woman she's heard worse, and probably at a much younger age than you'd like to imagine. It fucking sucks. But to escalate it to a physical assault makes you the criminal, not him. It gives him, and others like him, more power."
"I think the second one is a remodel. 

The style is Nouveau Bad Taste.

You should check out the blog McMansion Hell if you want to see more poorly designed houses from all over the country. It's a much more informative blog than I was thinking it was going to be when I first heard about it because of the Zillow thing."
"You will get a ticket tied to the license plate on the car mailed to the address it is registered to. If you pay it promptly, I think there is some small processing fee. If you're late, you'll get a late fee.

Businesses and tolls near Canada will often be OK to take your currency, but you're not close enough here. No one is going to take your money in NYC - especially not the government."
"Incredibly, incredibly common. I know plenty of people who prefer it for a variety of reasons - not just fiscal ones. There's no stigma against being any age and having roommates. In fact, I know several couples who have been married for ages that have roommates. It's not viewed here the way it is elsewhere. "
Yep. That's actually pretty low. Some want 15% of the yearly amount
You'd better watch out.  There are people who were actually born in brooklyn that live that far out on the L.  
"Arguing with a racist ""is like playing chess with a pigeon, it doesn't matter how good you are, the pigeon is going to knock all the pieces down and shit on the board and parade around like he's won"" - Eric Cantona

Don't argue with them. If they continue to try to get a reaction out of you, people will stand up for you. However, if someone tries to physically harm you, you fight and defend yourself.

"&gt; I'd have a high-paying job so wouldn't be subject to the stresses

lololol"
"While you say you're trying to be empathetic, the commentary around who you think they are makes it seem like you're not being quite as successful as you could be. ""[T]hey seem like rent-controlled tenants"", ""this woman has some emotional issues"", ""Her English isn't great"" - even if all of this is totally 100% objectively true, thinking about it from this perspective is going to make it difficult for you to ""manage the relationship"" with them. A little sympathy, IME, goes a long way in these situations. I know you say you're trying to do this, but your writing betrays that you're not totally there yet.

Soapbox aside, I'd recommend that you try to find and talk to the husband. Let him know that you're going to get thicker rugs (the vast majority of your walking around area should be covered) and will try to work on your heavy walking and that you hope you guys can deal with this amicably. 

I would not go to the landlord or management or anything. I'd just get new floor coverings, keep shoes off inside, and try to pay attention to the footfalls during the day. 

Good luck!"
Super high rent.
"Subscribe to the [Nonsense NYC mailing list](https://www.nonsensenyc.com/)! 

They send out a batch of interesting events each week. It reminds me of the Stefon character from SNL. For example, here is [the last newsletter](http://nonsensenyc.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/archive/nonsensenyc/20170630090928/) which happens to include a cartoon carnival, an air mattress regatta, and a gay pride game show. 

I don't live in NYC anymore, but I have attended a few things from Nonsense in my day â€“ such as a moving party that walked across the Brooklyn Bridge, a Pee Wee Herman-themed Halloween warehouse party, James Bond LARPing... the oddities abound."

Chris Christie will personally come to your house and demand donuts and candy in lieu of cash. 
"Did you really think you could just live for free and not have to face any consequence? 

You absolutely owe the money. You know the money was never deposited, and you tried to get away with it. "
"One of the funniest things I've ever seen on the train was two kids who were yelling shit at a pretty generic looking middle aged lady. She looked like she might be a librarian or something.   She wasn't really paying them much mind, but then just snapped, looked at them and yelled: ""you know what, you both are loads that should have been swallowed."". The kids were so shocked they couldn't even react, then she got off the train. "
"The Post and the Daily News are not reputable news sources.

I'm a moderate, and I read the WSJ, NYT, and the newswires (Reuters/AP) to get diverse accounts of events/information."
"Every sitdown restaurant with a waiter, tip at least 18% of pre tax price. Waiters are not paid minimum wage. If you can't afford to tip, you can't afford to eat there.


At a bar, $1 a drink, maybe $2 for a complicated cocktail. 

Not necessary where there is a tip jar. It's nice to throw some change in, but those people do make minimum wage. 


Tip for services.  Cab driver. Manicure. Leave some money for the maid in the hotel room. Fast food delivery. Someone carries your bags to your room."
Go to the ER at Bellvue. The bills will be drastically reduced or forgiven if you're unable to afford it.
"Go to the actual precinct that covers your neighborhood. Tell the officer at the window you want to speak to the Neighborhood Coordination Officers (NCO's) that covers your area. If they aren't there at the time ask for their email addresses. Explain the situation and if you have documentation (record of 311 calls, video, etc.) show that to them. No matter what keep on calling 311 every single time it happens and please do not under any circumstances take any type of vigilante action. I don't know where you live but at least in my area chronic 311 calls are being taken seriously. I know that sounds like BS but it is true. If you don't mind letting me know, what precinct covers your area?

"Dude, that's literally a mile short of a marathon.You're not going to have any time to stop!"

"Nope, not safe at all. You're probably going to die. Did you ever see The Warriors? It's 100% like that. "
"Get a few roommates and live about 45minutes-hour from midtown, and that's more than doable."
"The A is great when it is express. 

However, the late night local A is one of the worst rides ever. I have seen more shit go down on the local A than any other train. It's slow, crowded and has the wrong mix of drunk kids, the mentally ill and fatigued night shifters. 

After midnight, you're better off taking the 1."
"ignore it. I'm a big guy, but i hate getting into altercations. plus you never know what crazy motherfucker has a weapon out there, and is hoping to instigate something. Headphones and sunglasses are my best friend in the subway. But yeah, if my SO was getting hassled in front of me, I probably would lose my cool for that. Fortunately she's extremely level headed and was born and raised here, and she woudl probably say the exact same thing.

But yeah, touch me, and it's on"
On my roof. PM me for an invite to my rooftop party.
"I like how people from NY tend to be upfront and speak their minds with things. I could never live in the South and deal with it's constant run around bullshit with conversations that drag on forever. I get that it's just the old timey, folksy politeness, Southern way of doing things etc but idk it skeeves me out and seems so disingenuous and phony at times. Stop asking me where I go to church.

I'd rather a person speak what's on their mind than giving me a fluffy filler sort of explanation that tip toes around things. Sometimes you don't want to have a 15 minute conversation when it's 9pm and you just want to get bread and eggs.

I also like how some people here aren't afraid to call someone a fucking asshole and argue with them when they see something genuinely fucked up. I kind of hate the crunchier areas of the country where there's a lot of passive aggressiveness around being proactive against people spreading hatred. But I can't entirely fault these areas for these kinds of behavior when there's barely any diversity to be had. "
"I don't believe any legal apartment building has only one form of egress.  Is there a basement with a door? Fire escapes? Fire stairwells?  In the event of a true emergency, a glass door can be broken with a heavy enough object.  A fireproof hollow metal door would be another story."

You should probably talk to a lawyer about this.
So you lived for free for 2 years? It's time to pay up.
"Where were you in May when this plan was offered to the Community Board 6 Transportation Committee? Where were you in January when the DOT held workshops to get opinions from those in the neighborhood? The DOT recommended this plan, so not sure what you expect them to do. Do you think you have some insight that they don't?

You missed your chance. Things change. You'll get over it."
"Being from Texas, I talked with a professor of mine about the New York thing and she broke it down for me like this. In Texas, it's rude to honk at someone who is taking a little too long to make a turn or going when it's green. You just don't do it unless it's extreme. But in New York, she said, it's rude for that person to take that long to turn or go on a green light, not the person honking. 

In any case, I've become well aware to get out of people's way, especially since I'm a slow walker. The big difference is the amount of small talk I've seen. In Texas, people will start a conversation pretty quickly while that's not the case over here. "
"I'd be more concerned over the cleanliness of his living quarters rather then the situation itself. You don't know the full story of why he's living there, but regardless of that he's not interested in keeping it tidy so that says something. Don't bother asking about living situations, most people aren't living in their dream homes in NYC. If you like someone just like them :) it really is that easy. "
"Russian Turkish Baths but same sex only. 

That is 100% non sexual. You will get kicked out for anything else.

Close to NYC is Fire Island. Drive to Robert Moses then walk east to enter federal beach area.

Be aware blatant sexual activity will result in arrest. Area monitored by park rangers. Many of the regulars know their mobile #s and will text them to report deviant behavior or harassment."
This is super normal. Just move back already and pick up where you left off.
"Don't spend more than $800 on rent, get roommates, don't eat out all the time or splurge like it's going out of style, and you can manage - did so on that salary for a few years. "
