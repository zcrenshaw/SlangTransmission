"Yep, this is definitely worth it, especially for the first year or so. Pay yourself ""rent"" and you'll get yourself a nice little nest egg going. 

Frankly, if there's a monthly late-night arts thing you want to do and going home would be near-impossible, you can probably afford to Hotel Tonight or something nearby for $100."
"Uhhhh yes. And if you don’t want it, I’ll take it. "
"You can stay on the downtown 6 train when it is at the last stop (city hall) until it wraps around and goes back uptown. This allows you to see the old and abandoned city hall station.

Probably because you know people who grew up in wealthier areas of NYC and not in working class parts where the accent is more common. 
"Not really an easter egg, but Grand Central - 42nd Street has a lot of entrances that don't go through the station building, which let you avoid the giant crowds. For example, the entrance next to the Pershing Square Starbucks drops you directly on top of the 4/5/6 platforms, while the one by Blue Bottle Coffee leads straight to the S. You can also travel pretty far (for example, to 335 Madison) without going above ground.
"
"Do not let the kids on your parent's property. They are exposed now to all sorts of civil actions should a kid get injured.

I would visit the school. Get the name of who you speak with. Write a certified letter, return receipt requested, ID on delivery. 

Following that, bring a copy of your letter and ask to speak to the community affairs officer at the precinct. Follow up with a letter to that officer in the same manner.

Be aware that in New York State in a civil case, a defendant can not argue comparative negligence against a child. You really need to put this on the school and give them actual notice which then as a defense you would claim the school was negligent."
$4000 a month is definitely enough to rent an apartment in Astoria. Also is anyone else surpirsed at how high GI bill housing allowance is?
The stereotypical New York accent has never been universal. It's mostly people from Bay Ridge and certain areas of Staten Island. 
A $20 tip won’t get you jack shit in NYC
More.
however much money you think you've saved...should've saved more. and then some.
"There is an abandoned NYC subway station that was painted in a way that when you look out the window on a train passing this station there is a Zoetrope cartoon thingy

Have you even sat down for 3 seconds to calculate how obvious this is?
"You're in the greatest city, but the weekend Netflix quicksand is just as appealing. Be intentional about how you spend your time. Go to LI, NJ, upstate. Find activities during your limited time off. Literally every great act is there once a year. Make it a point to see your favorites. It's expensive, but go to MSG. 

Lastly, location is worth it. If you can sacrifice amenities / deal with roommates, do it if it can get you into whatever neighborhood you want to live in. 

For me, at the end of the day, I knew I wouldn't always live here. Wish I had more of a ""screw it. Spend the money and make the memories"" attitude.

"6 1/2 Ave is pretty cool (though short).

"Asian man born and raised in NYC. My experience may be different with other Asian Americans, having grown up relatively integrated with American culture as a whole, and not having the experience of, say, growing up with only Asian friends or growing up in a place where I was the only Asian dude.

Let me just say that I know many Asian Americans that don't have trouble with their dating lives. In my experience, many of the Asian Americans that face dating hardships... well, it's not their Asian-ness. It's usually other, more personal, traits that make dating harder for them.

At the risk of stereotyping really hard... well, I know a lot of Asian dudes that really live up to the meek, insecure, Asian dude stereotype. Sometimes it manifests as being very timid. Other times, it manifests as trying too hard to appear cool, masculine, or whatever.

"Yes. I think it is beautiful here at Christmas with lots to do and see. It can be manic depending on where you go and when (Rockefeller Center on a Saturday evening is crazy, etc...) but the atmosphere is great and, for my money, you need the cold weather at Christmas. As long as you expect it to be cold and busy with tourists, then you'll have a fantastic time."
"Not sure if it’s a secret, but I love hitting those musical light things at the Herald Square subway "
I work at the Met so I might be able to help you! There is a public bathroom that is usually empty right near the underground entry to the Opera. The best way I can direct you to it is if you enter the glass doors to Lincoln Center that are across the street from Julliard and go straight until you hit a wall. Then take a left and there is a glassed in area that has restrooms. There are also a ton of security guys down there that will tell you hot to get there. Also if that doesn’t work you can go to lincoln center film society and tell them you are seeing a movie later but just need to use the restroom.
"Union Square during Christmas is delightful. The smell of honey roasted nuts from street vendors is divine. Drinking real hot chocolate, thick as mud, after a cold walk melts your soul. All of the joys of New York Christmas are because it's cold and you're still outside. Buy gloves, a good hat, wool socks, and go for a walk in the city!

But skip the statue of liberty, not worth it. "
"I'm literally trying to think how far away such an apartment would have to be for me to even consider *not* taking up this offer.  My answer thus far is ""Philadelphia""."
""" Some delivery guys will also hand out menus to their delis so you can order food to the line if you feel like it…"" I love NYC.
"
"I know that's not what you asked, but get rid of the car. 

Seriously, it will be an albatross in a very short time."
"I still hear it; it's most often from the blue collar folks and certain areas, like Staten Island. But overall, it's not pervasive throughout NYC.  "
"Hascids are notoriously litigious. Seriously, don't let the kids on your property. "
And deeper into Brooklyn and Queens. 
"You'll be cursing that walk any time the weather's bad, not to mention burning countless hours dealing with the G + transfer to get into Manhattan. Source: Used to live off the Grand stop"
"Most folks on this sub live here, so wouldn’t have much to offer in the way of hotels and hospitality knowledge.

However if I had to guess, I quite doubt that would be the case here. Vegas overflows with upgrades because of that’s their business model there (hotel is cheap or comped to get you to stay and gamble more). Think of nyc as a theme park - everything is overpriced and free shit is non existent. "
Damn. $48K just for rent? Most families in NYC live off that much as their entire income. Jeez. I’m in the wrong business.
"Instead of thinking about trying to sleep while there are parties down below your window, think about making friends with those neighbors and partying on the terrace along with them."
"Also, most things that are on the Scouting NY website are sort of Easter Eggs.

"A bit of a positive one, which might not sound it: NYC is just a city. It's really big compared to other cities, but it's really totally manageable. I had a few big worries: I'd get mugged in the subway; I'd only be able to live in an apartment with cockroaches; everyone on street would scam or otherwise yell at me. But it's totally fine. New York is very safe, it's crazy but you find your little part of it and make it your own. Since I'm from Toronto, I like to say that New York is just like Toronto, only bigger; Toronto has everything New York has... it's just that NYC has 12 of them and Toronto only has one.

One unexpected downside I can think of: while there's LOTS to do here, there aren't enough ""*cool*"" events compared to the number of people who want to attend. Free movie night under the stars? Line up starts at 3 p.m. and there is no space. Cool new rooftop bar opens in Brooklyn? It's either packed with a line or the drinks are $25 and they'll only seat you if you're ordering food. Food fair with nice food trucks and food stands? Expect to line up for 15 minutes per item."
It moved out to the suburbs of LI and NJ
I have started one but it just has my hard drive and undies.
"It's far and away going to be the most expensive part of moving here, so having it given to you is a pretty big leg up. Also, can't you try it and see how it goes and move if you don't like it?

Might also give you an opportunity to settle into your routines and identify where you are spending most of your time so you can make a more informed decision before you start paying [Insert Rent Here]/month to live somewhere for a year."
"My boyfriend and I usually get to the park around 7am. We bring a blanket, some snacks and drinks, portable phone chargers, and other things to do. The line starts to move around noonish and generally the people working the line will let you know if you won't get a ticket as to not waste your time.

Some delivery guys will also hand out menus to their delis so you can order food to the line if you feel like it. It's a great opportunity to just chill out in the park for a while."
"Oh yeah, drunk me has done it a time or 7"
I think this is the only time r/asknyc has given such an unanimous answer
especially regarding New Jersey.
"Try to see if theres a resource officer at one of the food incubators. I know of six. Not sure if they are still operational or if there are new ones.


Brooklyn foodworks   
Chobani food incubator   
Foody future  
Hot bread kitchen  
Bronx cookspace  
Pilot works. 

I believe Jersey also has a couple food incubators.

Good luck!!


Edit- not sure why my edit made a whole new post, but I'm keeping them both since they both have some helpful comments."
"Going with a historical perspective:

- Manhattan: Bow, as the word has been translated to ""the place where we gather wood for bows""

- Queens: Port, as it was named for the princess of Portugal and also for the waterfronts

- Bronx: Bridge, as the area was a major crossing point between NY and New England. Also it bridges many cultures.

- Staten Island: Kills, as it relates to the Dutch-settler named areas, also appropriate as it's an island and a kill is a body of water

- Brooklyn: Marsh, as etymologically the borough name comes from the word for marshland in Dutch"
"NYC is full of great parks.  Since you'll be in Central Park there's a great playground called Heckscher Playground at the southern end of the park.  Very close to it is the carousel.  

Also, look up Time Out NY kids edition and see what's cheap and free this week. "
Very interesting! Thank you to the OP and everyone who contributed to this thread.
Throw a stick in the air.  It'll land on one.
There's also one of those whispering posts on the mezzanine I think. 
just grab a pizza and bottle of wine and eat in brooklyn bridge park
Take her out there Friday night so she can meet the men that live there.

Holy shit, this, my brain remembers?? "
Look into taking the LIRR to Long Beach. Plenty of bars and restaurants walking distance from the train and so is the beach. 
My guess is Blue Point Blueberry Ale. They're owned by budweiser so there's tons of distribution and since they started on LI people can think they're drinking something local while at JFK.
