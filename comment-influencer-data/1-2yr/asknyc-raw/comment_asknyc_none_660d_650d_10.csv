I'd much rather have to rely on the MTA than literally any other public transportation system in the United States.
"A line from Brooklyn, through Queens, into the Bronx. Such a pain always having to go through Manhattan to get from one borough to another. "
I fucking love to give directions.
Most people who complain about gentrification are themselves gentrifiers.  They are the biggest cornballs.  
"My unpopular opinion is the Upper West Side is a flavorless utterly beige neighborhood. 

Also I love the G train"
Upvoted becuase this is *truly* unpopular 
"Literally every type of commuter/transport is an asshole. Bikers, Pedestrians, Drivers, Skateboarders and **especially your kid who rides their scooter like its a bugatti on the autobahn**"
"Don't know whether to upvote you for having an unpopular opinion

Or downvote you for being wrong. 
"
Buy a bus ticket and go somewhere where you have friends and family who can help you out. 
"I think Times Square is a neat place for a tourist to visit their first time here.

*ducks*"
"I know a girl who moved to NY from Ohio in high school and now lives in Flatbush and harps on gentrification so hard. Your parents are doctors, you went to private school and have a college degree, being black in a black neighborhood doesn’t make you a local."
No not anymore.
Because everyone else is wrong.
"Atlantic and Flatbush.  Two major thoroughfares in Brooklyn cross where there's a commuter rail terminal, major subway stop, and a sports arena.

Also Flatbush Ave violates the street grid so s number of other streets intersect nearby as well."
"De Blasio is a good mayor.
"
"Times Square was the first thing I saw after getting off the Megabus at 2AM. *Holy shit*, it makes quite an impression. I was immediately led down a dark side street full of garbage by Google Maps, which also felt very New Yorky. "
"Shuttle between 96th and 2nd Ave, 96th and Lex, 96th and Central Park West, and 96th and Broadway. "

"Sunnyside is quite safe and I believe Queens has more different languages spoken than any other NYC borough.  Discrimination will not be a problem.

You do not need a car here, at all.  I'm 47 and I do not have a license.  His quality of life will improve considerably, I'd wager."
"125th street connector between the 1, ABCD, 2,3 and 456.  

Uptown has no east-west connectors and desperately needs one. 96th street would be another option, but this would better serve people in Harlem, W'ton Heights, Inwood and the Bronx. It would make getting to and from the upper east side from the UWS, Harlem, W'ton Heights and Inwood MUCH easier. AND it would open up connections between Upper Manhattan and the South and East Bronx (and Queens to a lesser extent). Of course, it'll never happen, at least not until the whole of upper manhattan is gentrified :(

It’s just good balance. Don’t lock your knees.
If a tinder date challenges you to a video game they aren’t looking to be in public my guy.
Extend the astoria elevated to LGA
I love the bus system. It's efficient and way easier to track than the subway.
"Whether or not it should be called “pizza”, Chicago pizza is better than New York’s"
"Your wife is right, you can't give them a reaction, it's what they're looking for. Just keep walking, it's in real life trolling, and you can't feed the trolls."
"I love how ""gritty"" = black people going  aboout their daily business. "
"I would go to a Korean spa and get a service. It's really affordable and what you get for your money is amazing. I love the dry rooms. The salt rooms are really relaxing. The one I go to here in Jersey is really really clean. They have an amazing friendly staff and you can just relax. And yes it's communal locker rooms and baths so you're naked with strangers(men and women have separate bath rooms). But you get over it petty quick, and the whole experience just makes me feel more confident and centered.

Katz's Deli isn't that great. Fette Sau is not good food. and really expensive for bland BBQ. Same goes for Dinosaur BBQ.
There is no service worker who will turn their nose up at a 50% tip. You were very generous.
"You do like a midday freshening up. Touch up your make-up, hair, etc. Also, you're only here a few months. As you walk more and more, you won't get so worn-out looking."
i don’t think halal carts are *that* great and i especially don’t care for rafiqi’s
Tourists are good for the city.
"Ugh, no. I just go showtimed 2 mins ago in the way from Canal to DeKalb on the Q (of course the train stalled going over the bridge, too) and they are always objectively awful. I don't care if people perform in a stations but I have never thought to myself ""Gee, you know what this packed train needs? Guys doing backflips and stripper twirls on poles with loud music."" "
"I'm thinking Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, or maybe even Staten Island!"
"This is going to come across as insulting, and I don’t intent it to, but you have no idea what you’re talking about or the expensive nightmare that it would become. Firstly, they aren’t building any subways in westchester. Secondly, westchester does not *want* it’s world class schools rolled into NYC’s system nor do they want high density housing. Westchester cops get paid more than the NYPD, so do we now expect a few thousand cops to stay and take a cut in pay and benefits? Westchester County is almost double the size of NYC and includes 3 large cities and almost a million residents. Everything about this is a financial, political and social nightmare with almost zero positive points."
"New Yorkers are just as shallow and vapid as Angelenos, just in different ways. "
"If you can, walk around Times Square when nobody's around..at around four or five in the morning. It was breathtaking."

"Probably not, but the way people bitch about the MTA makes me think they've never used public transportation in other cities."
Extend it East under the river to connect with the N/W at Ditmars Blvd. and then on to LGA.
What the hell is a wicket?
