"LOL. The brand is Canada Goose.

And I live on UWS and work in Midtown East. Yes everyone is wearing the same jacket."
I honestly thought they were government-issued or something. Thank you. 
"I’d spend most of the 48 hours the way I’ve spent the majority of my time here: wandering around the city alone listening to headphones. 

Probably visit the neighborhoods near my old apartments first to say goodbye. Pay my respects to the bodegas and pizza places that sustained me. 

Get a strong, cheap whiskey drink at fresh salt. 

Subway out to a random stop in another borough and find a good cup of coffee and explore until I find myself back in familiar territory. 

Watch dogs play at a dog park. 

Stroll through Central Park, lay on my back in the grass, walk through an underpass, finally throw some cash at the trumpet player near the met. 

Take an indulgent cab ride. Pay him to just keep driving. "
Gristedes is the fucking worst and everyone know it.
Wait for the R train
"If I'm picking up the order myself, no tip, fancy or not. 

If its delivery, that's a different story. "
"Yeah Canada Goose lmao.

Everyone wears that shit. Those jackets are like 1K."
"It happens more often than you'd expect. Think of NYC as a collection of 100+ neighborhoods rather than one large city of 8 million. Outside of work, I mostly spend my time in like 3-5 of the same neighborhoods -- this is where I live, neighborhoods where my friends live, neighborhoods where I do my shopping/groceries, and usually a trendy neighborhood I really like but can't afford to live (haha, but I can definitely go to bars/restaurants there and soak up the vibe!).

That's to say, after awhile, I start to make friends/acquaintances in those five neighborhoods. I might chat with a barista, see regulars in the bars I go to, take the same route to/from work each day, have established routines. After several months (but more likely several years), you start chatting with those people, or you meet someone at a dinner party and then run into them on the street. We build tiny communities here.

I see people I recognize but do not know on my commutes/workday routine routes (""the guy who always wears different hats""), a couple of times a week. 

I run into a friend or someone I know well enough to want to stop to say hi 1-2x a month or so. Way more often in the summertime.

tl;dr NYC is a collection of 100 small communities, people gravitate to a few that fit them best. Others with same lifestyles also gravitate to those same communities. Mix and mingle. "
"I got attacked not two weeks ago on 34th and Broadway at 8:15 AM by a guy who hit me and then screamed in my face “WHY ARE YOU HOLDING ME HOSTAGE?! WHY ARE YOU HOLDING ME HOSTAGE?!” And then grabbed my arms and began grappling. I made eye contact with literally dozens of people around, saying “I don’t know this man, PLEASE HELP ME!”   The masses fled like cockroaches. I broke free and tried to walk quickly away, hoping this stranger would leave me alone- but he walked right alongside me, yelling in my face “TERRORIST!  TERRORIST!” (Which thankfully made everyone look.) I finally ducked into the first building lobby I could, and security chased him away. As I left the safety of the building,  a woman approached to reassure me that everyone “hadn’t abandoned you, we were all running around looking for a cop.” Small consolation, but I don’t blame them for not stepping in.  When I finally saw a cop (In Times Square,) I mentioned to them that there was a guy on 34th who was GOING to hurt someone today. They asked if I was the person who’d called 911 about it. I wasn’t, but was glad that someone did. 
 Anyway- what bothers me is that I’m so cautious. Extra alert for danger. Middle aged Mom from the Midwest who remembers not to smile at strangers on the street. And I got attacked. I’ve lived in Manhattan for 3 Years now. And it’s getting worse. Thanks for the vent. Stay safe, redditors."
"Fine dining with a twist of sinful greasy deliciousness? Get a burger and a hot dog at NoMad bar. Tell your wife you're going for that kind of food and she'll laugh at you till she gets there. Also make reservations and tell her to dress up a bit.    

Philly cheese steak - Shorty's.    

The breakfast staple in NYC is a bacon egg and cheese on a roll. Make sure you get one. Not a fancy one, but just a plain greasy one from a breakfast cart or a bodega.    

Fried chicken sandwich at Root &amp; Bone is pretty good. Also - spicy chicken sandwich from Fuku. Neither are disgustingly greasy but both are delicious and I think deserve to be in this category.   

For dessert stuff, your wife might want to partake, and you can feel free to indulge, in the [basic bitch essentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/7vji9j/what_are_the_latest_hiptrendy_foodsactivities_but/dtszand/) here.    

For BBQ, hit up Hill Country or if you need to find a restaurant in times square, hit up Virgils. Not the best, but decent.     

Definitely go to Katz's deli for a pastrami sandwich. Don't mind the price, it's a literal stack of meat. NYC staple right here.   

Alternate best burger but still upscale, Minetta Tavern. It's a steakhouse, so be prepared to spend $$.

What is really confounding is not how expensive it is but how overpriced it feels. You walk in and it feels like a typical cheap kinda crappy super market. And then you see the prices. Whole Foods is expensive but at least you theoretically get the feeling you are getting extra quality for your money.
"Just moved here from Texas and noticed the same thing. A black Canada Goose jacket with a Fjallraven backpack, and a pair of Sorel or Timberland boots."
"OF COURSE!! One of the best self-care opportunities you’ll ever have is time by yourself enjoying the things you love.

I go to shows alone all the time, because hardly any of my friends like the same music as me. Try it, it’s amazing and you might meet someone while you’re out! Also, going to the theater and dinner solo is amazing too. Just bring a good book with you and stay off of your phone. Really try to enjoy that moment of solitude and commit to it!"
"Nobody looks that sexy in a parka. Even a $1k parka. If you want sexy, go to Uniqlo and buy one that looks almost the same, and is just as warm, for $149 and spend the rest of the money on hookers and cocaine. "

"So for one thing, you're in a rent regulated building.  Rent regulation encompasses rent stabilization and rent control.  Rent control is a dying beast and is held onto or passed on to relatives from those who have been residing there since 1971.   You are almost certainly in a rent *stabilized* apartment, and specificity matters because the two programs are very different.  Control is a dinosaur, stabilization is alive and well.

In rent stabilization, the landlord is limited in what she can charge by the yearly guideline increase determined by the Rent Guidelines Board as well as 18-20% vacancy increases.  There are other ways to increase the rent in stabilized units though, and that's particularly through Individual Apartment Improvements (IAIs) and Major Capital Improvements (MCIs).  IAIs and MCIs both increase the legal rent.  The landlord can use those improvements to raise the legal rent above what the neighborhood going rate can bear, and so a preferential rent can be offered instead.  When a tenant agrees to a pref, he will pay less than what the landlord is legally entitled to pay, but depending upon how the pref is written into the lease, the landlord can retain the right to revoke the preferential rent at the next lease renewal.  The landlord can also charge any percent rent increase on a preferential rent as long as it doesn't exceed the legal rent, so if the legal is $2000 and you're paying $1500, the landlord can offer you a renewal lease next year at $2000/mo even if the Rent Guideline Board said there would be a 0% rent increase on 1 year renewals.

It's a totally typical real estate model to buy a property with stabilized units that haven't been renovated, do renovations to increase the legal rent through IAIs or MCIs, and then increase the value of the building through a larger rent roll.  The landlord can also refinance the mortgage at this point to get a more favorable rate, or use the increased equity in the building to put toward buying more buildings.  The more renovations the landlord can do, the more money he stands to make.

Transferring apartments within a building is not uncommon, and if you think that they're doing decent work, you could end up in an apartment with new bells and whistles at very little cost to you.  You may have some leverage in that the landlord wants to get into you apartment to do renovations and get a new tenant in at a higher rent, and so you might be able to negotiate a more favorable rent in your new apartment if you choose to switch.  You might also be able to negotiate a preferential rent *for the term of your tenancy* as opposed to the term of your lease, but you should consult with a landlord-tenant attorney to make sure the language is appropriate and that you are agreeing to something that will hold.  

**If you don't want to move from your apartment, your landlord *cannot* make you.** Your landlord is fully entitled to renovate apartments near you but if you feel that the construction is being used as a form of harassment to push you out of the building, or as a form of retaliation if you choose not to move, that is an accepted form of harassment and the city has a very effective task force to help defend your case.

The governing body that oversees rent stabilization is DHCR. This is their list of fact sheets: http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/  They are the be-all, end-all of rent regulation in the city and will help you know your rights.  DHCR also has a hotline that you can call for assistance."
"Stay out of that person's way and don't say or do anything to provoke them. Don't even look at them. Call 911 and provide a location and a physical description of the individual and then move on. Cops are everywhere in NYC, he's acting that out-of-control, one is bound to pick him up. "
"Not just a lack of nightlife but a lack of restaurants as well. Many of the restaurants only open on weekdays and close by 7 pm because they primarily serve the daytime swell of office workers.  That said, Fidi is becoming more residential and is a perfectly fine place to live that’s only getting better. "

"As someone who was incredibly afraid of bed bugs, and then had to deal with them ...there are a lot of misconceptions about having them, and having them in your building. We worked with a really great company who told us a lot about dealing with the bugs, and if they are dealt with appropriately, it shouldn't be a problem (that means that the tenants are doing their part, too, and not just having their apartment treated).


The reason bed bugs can be hard to get rid of is:

1) treatment is pricey, and either people don't have the money or don't want to spend the money to get it treated by a reputable company so they try to deal with it themselves &amp; fail

2) they get it treated by a good company but don't follow all of the instructions (what to wash/dry, what to throw out, etc)


Take them up on their offer for inspections, throw down diatomaceous earth, get a bed bug cover for your bed, check under your bed for markings every so often. If you are really that worried, maybe make an agreement with the landlord that you have your apartment inspected every month or so for the next 6 months. Honestly, I would still take the apartment, and this is coming from someone who cried hysterically when she found out about having bed bugs. "

There's also a vodka room where you can pay $20, put on Soviet-era military uniform, and drink all the vodka you want for a few minutes."

www.streeteasy.com is my preferred search engine for apartments in the city.

Generally you can look for apartments with the help of a broker or without one.  This subreddit and New Yorkers in general are split on whether they are blood sucking leeches or helpful advocates.  I am pro-good broker.  I will explain in a moment.

If you peruse Streeteasy and find an apartment that you love, unless it says ""No Fee"", you will almost certainly be contacting a broker who is representing that listing.  Some apartments will have exclusive brokers--meaning they're the only person showing that apartment--and some will not. In many cases, an apartment on Streeteasy will have ""just rented"" as soon as your inquire about it.  Sometimes this is the truth because apartments go very fast, or it can be a bait and switch.  In either case, the broker you contact will almost certainly follow up with ""But I can show you some others just like it!""   Some of those may be beautiful apartments intentionally on the very high end or higher than your stated budget.  A broker collects a fee at lease signing if they find you a place.  The fee is typically 10-15% or 1 month's rent.  It is sometimes negotiable. 

There are pros and cons to using a broker.  One: they do a lot of the leg work for you.  They have access to better listings than the layperson does, they often hear about listings before a layperson does, and they arrange for a full day of apartment tours, including mapping out an appropriate order, scheduling access with the landlord and so on.  Doing this on your own is a huge time suck. If you use a good broker, they will help you check out neighborhoods you hadn't considered and if you're new to town, that can be a huge asset. They can also negotiate a slightly lower rent in some cases but you can do that on your own too.  They'll also help you coordinate a complete rental application, which will include things like your bank statements, W2s and so on.

If you do find a place through Streeteasy, and it's not already rented, but it's being represented by a broker, you will pay a broker's fee for an apartment you found yourself and that's a bitter pill to swallow.  There are also some very unscrupulous brokers out there and there is a risk of working with someone who represents themselves to be a broker but then turns out to be a scammer.  For this reason, beware of too-good-to-be-true apartments.  They probably just stole the pictures off of somebody else's listing, with an unrealistically low price, and often some lie about an absentee landlord overseas.

What I have done twice now, and which I recommend to friends, is to factor in the cost of a broker as the cost of doing business and contacting a broker from a reputable agency FIRST, not just some rando from a Streeteasy apartment listing that looked nice.  Cooper &amp; Cooper provided me with our favorite broker who we still use, and he has since moved on to Compass, which is also reputable.  I also have a great broker at Modern Spaces that we really liked.  Often a broker will specialize in a certain area of the city but they can usually branch out.  A *good* broker is a good person, trustworthy, who you enjoy spending several afternoons comparing and contrasting apartments with.  Our broker sincerely has our best interest at heart.  A good broker lives and dies by his reputation, so he really does just want to see you in a place that's a good fit for you.  My husband plays online chess with our broker, and he checks in on us periodically.  He has invited us out to dinner with his wife.  He's found two apartments for my sister in law and possibly soon to be a third.  I trust him, and he's done great by us.  There are others out there like him! There's a great broker on this board too.

The non-broker route is to search for ""no fee"" apartments.  These are generally in bigger, newer buildings and sometimes they offer one month's rent free but be aware that your rent is now amortized and will jump up to the true rate plus an increase the next year.  Another no-fee route is to walk around the neighborhood you like and call management companies directly by the numbers they have on their buildings, or by asking building supers and doormen.  This is by far the best and cheapest way to find an apartment but it can take time, and because it's on foot and in person, you can't sort by pricing and what's available.  It's honestly the best but it's also a bit like throwing darts blindfolded.

This is a novel already but if your husband is working in midtown, you have a lot of transportation options.  Consider the Upper East Side, Upper West Side, Morningside Heights, Washington Heights, Hell's Kitchen, and Astoria or Long Island City, all depending upon where in midtown your husband's office will be and what kind of building and neighborhood you're looking for.

"I really don't think cell phones had, or have, much to do with people living near each other. Sure, you might have to plan a little more in advance.

You live where you can afford, and where you're comfortable. Maybe you make friends at a local bar or other similar location. But friendships are organic, and accommodate location."
