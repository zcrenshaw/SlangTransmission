Just assume it's from an AC and keep on walking 
"Tribeca, not even close."
"Sounds like we run in very different circles.

Lifetime New Yorker. Yea some people do coke, but if everyone you meet does coke, might be time to examine whether the common factor is something on your end."
"Yes! Easy way - trains ""drive"" on the right hand side, same as cars in the US. 

Uptown is on the east side of the street, downtown is on the west side of the street. "
"With my SO we’ll usually hit an oyster bar or walk around downtown and grab lunch or dinner. Getting drunk on the bus I usually grab a flask of Georgi and throw it in a 32oz Gatorade or throw a beer in a coffee cup, sometimes I’ll do an Irish coffee if I’m feeling classy. Whatever my beverage of choice I then choose a bus line and ride it until I see something interesting and then I get off. The bus is a really unique way to see your neighborhood, it allows you to see places you normally wouldn’t when traveling via subway or cab as it’s slow enough to get a good look and takes routes you maybe normally wouldn’t if you were walking or taking a cab. Also, you’re drunk."
That's one of the oldest scams in the book. You fell for it hook line and sinker. 
Don't do anything. Let him make the first move. Bet nothing comes from it.
"Summertime: air conditioning condensation

Post-rain: water coming off a fire escape

Winter: snow melt

In the Subway: drippings of rain from the ceiling

In all of those cases, it's probably only 1 in 10 parts urine."
"Yes you do, you just haven't seen them do it lol"
"Not stopping, walking away, and generally not engaging at all."
If I had an email saying no rent until the gas came on I’d be all about space heaters and zero contact with the landlord.
Your misspelling of perusing is so much better than the real spelling.
"There are a few that are pretentious in their own ways, but the UES has a much longer legacy than the rest."
Tribeca.
"Veselka and Empanada Mama for good food. Starbucks, McDonalds. There are some 24-hour gyms and laundromats too."
A quaint old lady watering plants on her fire escape.
Just tell me what neighborhood you live in and we can know the definite answer.
Ever since I watched *Mr. Robot* I now automatically think the CDs contain a virus to gain access to your computer.
"I’d ask the landlord to let us out of the lease early and I’d start looking for new living stitustuons. Sure, he’s the asshole and you’re right, but IME, not fucking worth it. GTFO. "
This is a real fine that is frequently enforced.

"You're probably not looking at reputable sites. Or you're seeing prices for  single rooms in a larger shared apartment. 

Streeteasy.com is reputable and much more reliable. "
You’d probably get better answers in a sub that wasn’t full of people from the place you want to leave.
"I usually do something respectable with my SO, but my favorite, favorite thing to do alone is get drunk and ride the bus."
This guy New Yorks.
"It's usually water condensation from an air conditioner. Window air conditioners are everywhere, and they all drip water. If it's a cold day, just tell yourself it's still an air conditioner, then think about butterflies or puppies or something."
"Nice try, ICE."
"They're blank.

Edit: I meant my mother"
"I keep an “NYC bucket list” of sorts in my notes in my phone so that when I wake up without plans, I have plenty of suggestions to myself that are ready to go. I add to the list as I hear about fun activities and restaurants, and then don’t have to search my memory for all the fun ideas I’ve had along the way, as they are already in one place for me to jog my memory. "
"The UWS and the UES for example actually have many (usually elderly) people of moderate incomes living there who have been there for 40+ years or more.  These areas have *always* been residential neighborhoods and not exclusively affluent.

TriBeCa is basically a ""neighborhood"" that was invented from scratch in the 90's. It was basically a commercial/industrial area with little to no residents and pretty much all the residential housing that was created was on the extremely high-end price-wise and the businesses that have opened-up there are catering to that clientele. 

It's also become *the* neighborhood for people from overseas who have been relocated by their firms to NYC, which also drives the prices *way* up due to the lack of price-sensitivity of these folks.

"Yes, I've heard horror stories about DSNY enforcement writing tickets, and they can hit small time landlords pretty hard. They will actually go through bags looking for violations, I've seen them do it.Yes, she is allowed to go through your garbage, legally I believe it's technically abandoned property. If cops don't need a search warrant to look through your garbage, your landlady can too."

"Sometimes it's some shitty wanna be rapper's shitty music, sometimes they're blank.

LIC - Construction
for sure. There's like entire stores selling 5 curated cooking knives or 7 norwegian wooden toys for babies.
"Good on you for getting out there and developing a social life. I've been here a year and don't know anyone yet. That said, I'm really surprised to hear this. I work in finance, even, and I don't know anyone who uses coke regularly, and it's not that people aren't open about what they're into using, either. You'd think it'd be most prevalent here."
"Roaches are everywhere. In general, it's a building by building issue. Look for a clean well kept building with an active live in super. Higher floors will be better than lower floors. Newer buildings will be better than older ones. All that said, one hoarder neighbor can infect a whole building. "
"Trashed NYU Students.

I'm assuming my neighborhood is self-explanatory"
"Wow, I didn’t know my eyes could ever roll so much."
They had one but the subways were messed up and everyone was late
"It depends very much on the area, anything between $1500 and 2000 in Manhattan below 125th Street is probably a bait and switch ad. That being said there are plenty of places between 2000 and 3000. "
This is how you don’t get your security deposit back to pay for perceived damages to the hallways and elevators. It is also a dick move. Big buildings do this so that people schedule moves while most residents are at work instead of screwing up weekend access to the building for everybody. 
"In the middle between the rows of seated people, usually where nobody else is standing. Don't clog the doorways."
"Was just in Tribeca tonight and it was just so snooty and new money. I go to the UES a lot and it's not pretentious, just rich. Old money doesn't care about you, new money has attitude. "
"Go to war. Fuck this guy. Call the cops every night, shit in his doorway, superglue his locks, find out when he sleeps and make a racket."
The subway seems popular 
"dollar vans.  At every stage of my life, I have assumed they have died off, but apparently they are still going strong.  Back in the day they would just ride up and down flatbush ave, ferrying people to Kings Plaza.  "
I’m partial to shake shack. 
"Tribeca, Soho, and Dumbo. Because not only are they rich, they are ""cool"" too! You might want to throw Williamsburg in there too. 

LIC has its own new brand of douche that basically consists of ""we aren't really Queens! We are just as chic as Manhattan!"" Sort of wannabes "
Pretty sure it would be very upsetting and might even get the police called if you yelled and sobbed uncontrollably in sheeps meadow pretty much anytime of day. 
"Also like...look at those camera angles and *think* about them. When we were paroozing zillow, I saw a few places that were 1500 - 2000 for one bedroom and it was like wow, I could afford that! Those places also conveniently leave out some crucial information like...square footage. The pictures will be perfectly angled so that your brain assumes there's more room just out of shot. No. If there was room, they'd show you. Those angled shots carefully only showing two out of four walls in a room are doing so, so that you can't see how absolutely small a place is.

I also know some places will take what is really a studio and essentially build a wall to be able to advertise it as a one-bedroom. Yeah it's a bedroom, but then buried down in the description is a little ""bedroom comfortably fits a twin sized bed!"" Like, my man, they can't even boast about a full fitting in there, it's gonna be a closet.

Now of course size isn't everything, plenty of people are 100% content and happy with small living. And it could encourage you to get out more! But truly, some of these miraculously cheap apartments are just *small* small. Like, smaller than you think for even nyc. And not chic, tiny house on TLC apartment living small. Just...small."
"You don’t have to clean your apartment, you just have to give them access. Assuming that most units in your building are of a similar layout, I’d be willing to bet he shows yours so often specifically because it’s cleans"
"No. Because it’s not even a campaign issue for the governor. Most people in NYC don’t know that Albany controls the MTA purse string, everyone just blindly assumes it’s a city agency and governor Andy is a master manipulator."
"UES West of Lexington, Tribeca, Williamsburg, Park Slope...all in their own ways."
