"I know this sounds horrid but I think we should have an opt out organ donation system and that anybody who does Opt out should be refused for receiving donated organs if they require a transplant. I understand some people are extremely anxious about giving blood and bone marrow donations can be intense and time consuming but once your dead your dead, no need for your organs  "
I use them to fuel my jacked up and kitted dually.
"A wealthy businessman is worth more than a mentally challenged person. A man is worth more than a woman depending on what skills and physical attributes each person have. Conversely, a woman can also be more valuable than a man. Your worth is determined by ability to produce favorable outcomes. Little Hitler would have been way more valuable than some random child. Some people are very clearly better and worth more both monetarily and socially. Some people have practically zero worth and serve zero purpose other than existing. Humans are replaceable and always will be. Some are much harder to replace than others, thus would seem appropriate to consider them more valuable."

A spat on twitter got a little crazy and suddenly everyone in the press and a handful of devs started sqwuaking that the entire industry from the developers to the fans is just absolutely packed to the gills with super nazis who also added women to their list of things to hate.

"Exchanging of ideas is what creates progress... The reason why America is such a land of progress right now is because it is also a land of opportunities. If you make your land a place that looks appealing to brilliant scientist or inventors or so on and so forth ... Then you will attract the greatest minds into one place and cause an influx of ideas which become hypothesis which are then tested until a new product is born... Thus progress happens.

"Transgender people have a higher rate of suicide even after they have been accepted by their family and friends and given support to transition to the other gender. I‚Äôm sorry but too much research suggests transgenderism (by choice) is a depression and a serious mental disorder.

Two genders. There are only two fucking(No pun intended) genders.

"Why not just put in the amount that she's allowed to eat for the whole serving, even if she eats it quickly? Seems to me the quick eating isn't the problem - rather, the problem is that if you give too much food that cat will overeat."
"more that most women now see any kind of advances as creepy or misogynistic, and because of that men are too paranoid of getting socially blasted for falling into that trap. Everyone just uses tinder now because we have all become socially paranoid due to exaggerated PC culture. It's such a huge step back from the 90's where everyone was pretty cool with each other and didn't take anything seriously, and were imho more comfortable around each other. What a sad time to be alive."
"Way it was explained to me is kind of like throwing trash out of a car (not promoting this behavior). If your car is going 60mph and you throw an object forward (such as a baseball) as hard as you can in the direction the car is traveling, the object will be going faster in the same direction as the car. Now take a vessel at the speed of light and do the same."
"Saw Inception at the cinema with friends like 8 years ago (damn!), tried to watch it on the computer once since then, but was constantly interrupted.

"yeah but you have to expose your children to those situations in order for them to learn how to act. yeah it sucks when theres a crying baby, but we as a society have made an agreement that states ‚Äòeveryone else put up with me as a baby, so ill put up with the babies around me‚Äô"
