"""I used to be a police officer like you, but then I took a burrito for free""

Yeah one time I put my arm into a badger hole and there was a badger in there
"You planned it out for weeks, and came up with ""Shake Spear""?

Damn..."
Is it normal for people in other parts of the world to randomly pick up plants to make tea?
So this is how guys feel when they read TIFUs about other dudes accidentally mutilating their penises...
No
"So you were tarred and feathered on the same night?
"
The look on your face when you remembered the burrito must have been priceless.
Wow what are the odds? You my son should stay in bed until the bad luck wears off........though I feel for you. 
Maeby you aren't to blame for this one.
I love you.
"Mmk, most of the TIFUs I read were circumstantial, yours was totally on you man."
"""The Burrito Bandito"" sounds cooler. "
"Well, first off sorry to hear of your experience turning out rough. Go see a doctor, and be honest with them. Too many people leave it to their ego to make these decisions and don't go go because they might be embarrassed. A little embarasament may happen but you may prevent scarring in an area which scars can deaden and even make it painful to stimulate. Take care of yourself."
Weeks...you spent literally hundreds of hours planning this joke and the best you came up with was a cheap masturbation gag?
This could’ve been so much worse. At least you were already cleaning up when he got home. I bet he laughed his ass off. 
I'm a guy and I cringed reading the title and the post
"in a world where people buy other people's soiled underwear, the old guy probably thought he scored big time"
At least he didn't fuck his couch
"All they had to do was say, ""hello sir, did you forget to pay?"""
Dude it's your family's fault for not telling you. If you like this Brianna talk to her and be cool about it ... she feels just as awkward as you 
"he laughed, hugged me, laughed some more, helped me make the bed, and then laughed some more."
seeing your girlfriend cleaning lube poop off the carpet kinda kills the mood for anal. 
Yeah... since when did going on a first date make you exclusive?  I’m sure those girls have never been on first dates with different guys in the same week...
Too be fair this was probably the best you could hope for. If your dad was having three affairs (that your mom knew of) the town is probably crawling with your half siblings.
so you said you were visiting the city. then you have an apartment. and what ever happened to that thing you had to do? this is a suspicious tale. 
lies. 
"Got to reply to this with a story. I was also in zombie mode. Went to gas station. (This was long ago, before ""pay before you pump."" ) Had a $20 in my pocket for gas. Put the nozzle in the tank and got it running. Fell asleep standing up leaning on the car. The nozzle clicking off woke me up. Gas pump said $20.26. 

Went inside, apologized for zoning out. Told gas dude that I was late for work, and would bring him 26 cents after I got off. Dude lost his shit, and said  I was going to pay him now, or he was calling the cops. 

I grabbed a notebook that was on the counter, scribbled a note in big letters. Then I held my drivers license up about a foot from the security camera, held up the $20, then handed it to gas boy, then held up my note that said ""I will bring this giant asshole 26 cents at 4 pm. Have a nice day."" Then I went to work. He was calling the cops as I left.
 Took the asshole .26 after work. Cops never came and spoke to me.

"That's the dumbest plan to get noticed in High School I've ever heard, congrats! "
"Police officer here. Three years ago, living in CO, the station got a call about a 'ghost' in someone's house. I wasn't the one on the phone, but apparently the person was hysterical and hard to understand. I arrived on the scene, this woman of about forty was standing in her front yard. The house is upper middle class, pretty bland.

She swears there is a ghost inside. The only reason we didn't disregard the call is because she claimed there was screaming in her attic. She claimed the ghost was doing it, I was supposed to make sure an animal wasn't stuck up there or something. She explains she has been hearing this screaming and bumping on the walls the past two days, she is the only one who lives there, no pets who could cause it, neighbors are in vacation. So, of course, the logical explanation is a ghost.

She was far too afraid to check the attic, so I head up there. It was full of cobwebs and musty, and of course the only lightbulb didn't work. I take a step, and all the sudden I hear banging and muffled yelling. Navigating with my flashlight, I head over to the source, a corner in the far back.

There was a hobo there. His leg had fallen through the floor and was stuck, and he couldn't get out. He started crying tears of joy when I walked over, thanking me and asking for help simultaneously. I pull him out, trying to scratch his leg as little as possible, and lead him outside after letting him stop and get some water.

He told me he was just looking for a place to spend the night, and I felt like he had gotten punished enough for his trespass. I asked if he needed anything else before I sent him on his way. Right when he opened his mouth to speak, I realised that he was a fifty foot tall, grey leviathan from the paleolithic era. He said ""Well, could I have about tree fiddy?"" I responded, 'I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy, Loch Ness Monstah! Get outta here!"" Looking defeated, he began to make his way to the nearest lake.

"Got one similar to this. When I first became a police officer years ago, in a small city, my training officer drove me around. He pointed out all the areas I'd need to watch out for. Typical first day stuff. Then we went into a convenience store where he grabbed a map off the counter and handed it to me and we walked out. Later in the day I saw a price tag on the map. I felt really awkward telling my training officer about it. He got red faced, drove back to the store, apologized and paid for the map. Apparently he thought the maps were free. 

On a side note, most gas stations give me free coffee. I appreciate it. I always expect to pay though and always go to the counter to pay. I don't want to be that guy that shoplifts a coffee. "
"The best way to get rid of crabs: Shave half your pubes, pour lighter fluid on the other half &amp; light it on fire... When the crabs come running out, stab them with an ice-pick! Works every time... "
My friend was about to hook up with a girl and she went to grab something as a substitute for proper lube because she didn't have any. She comes back with a handful of white cream and he rubs it on his dick and instantly regrets it. It feels like he's stoking the coals with his dick so he runs to the bathroom to wash it off. He said it hurt for a week and he found out later that it was callus remover. 
I'm saving this for every time I hear an obviously preventable story.

Obviously peeing was not the best follow up though. "

I live in the a rural area where mosquitos are a huge problem. This makes my skin crawl. We usually get a straggler when we open the door at night and spend a few nights waking up with bites.

This is the Maury shit I came to the thread for.
"My wife used to work at a pizza joint on the late shift. She was the assistant manager, so she had a certain amount of discretion. There was a string of robberies in the area, and she was often in the store by herself. 

She happened to know one of the assistant police chiefs from her bowling league, sh she called her up and told her, ""Spread the word, free coffee or soft drink refills for any LEO, from any department after 4 PM so long as they are in uniform, and come inside to get it.""

  When they started showing up, she also started randomly throwing in free breadsticks occasionally. She had MP's from the army base 5 miles away, state guys, and city guys dropping in too. Never got robbed :-)"

I’m surprised you didn’t throw up. Our vet recommends that we give our dogs hydrogen peroxide when they have done things such as eat socks.

"I'm going to share a story in commiseration.

Once when I had a particularly bad yeast infection, I woke up in the middle of the night from itching. I head to the bathroom for some Vagisil, but I declined to turn on the light to spare my sleepy eyes.

So, I grab the tube and swipe some on. As I'm putting on the cap, I notice the smell. That was *not* the smell of Vagisil. No, Vagisil isn't mentholated. Do you know what is, and comes in a similar style tube? Icy Hot.

There's a reason why they tell you not to put Icy Hot on mucus membranes. That reason is ""chemical burns.""

It's also worth noting that if you should happen to get Icy Hot on a mucus membrane, it is a mistake to try to rinse it off. No, ha ha. No, you poor fool. That makes it *angry.*

So, there I am, flat on my back in the tub, legs propped up on the wall with my labia directly under the bath faucet, small squeaks escaping my throat and tears running down my face.

On the plus side, the yeast infection stopped troubling me. I basically nuked the area.

"Your department should really use this as a training aid for other officers. Yes, LEOs are supposed to enforce the law, but should also use their own discretion and discernment in situations where, technically, the letter of the law was violated. In this case, your superiors as well as the gas station owners used theirs by not having you locked up.

"As is often the case, the title is not the FU. Lots of people have a ""dating life"" with no issues.

**The real FU is that you were using the SAME CONVERSATION for more than one girl rather than just having normal, genuine conversations.**

If you had just been messaging them without relying on a template, then you could've said. ""Oh, well, I didn't know you were roommates. And I hope it's OK that I planned a date with both of you. It's pretty typical for people to more than one first date on their calendar."" And then you would've seemed like a totally normal dude. Maybe one or both would bail, but you wouldn't have screwed up.

**But by having a similar conversation with both of them you are waving a huge red flag.** You're saying ""Hey, that conversation you thought we were having? It's actually a script."" And people don't like to feel like they are having a scripted conversation. It's weird. And people get turned off by weird. If they had a choice, they would probably prefer to go on a first date with a guy who has a fun conversation without needing a script.

**The real lesson is that if you want to appear attractive to someone, learn how to have a great conversation without relying on following a script. Yeah, it's easy to get a girl to like you in the beginning when you follow a script. But unless she's an idiot, she's eventually going to realize that your conversation skills are weak and get turned off by that.**

EDIT: from what I can tell from talking to women, conversation skills are a huge turn on to women, much more so than it is for men. If you're not good at conversation, that's OK: it's a skill you can learn and develop just like any other skill."

"Hopefully I can offer a bit more hopeful news.You may not have to throw everything out. I had bed bugs about 2 years ago now. Here is my advice. First get the exterminator in there and let him do his thing. If you never notice them again, you're probably fine. If you want extra precautions or if they are persistant, then get diatomaceous earth dust. It is a food supplement that 100% is guaranteed to kill bed bugs because it is not a chemical (sometimes bed bugs are resistant to chemicals), it is a powdery material that gets inside bed bugs and basically dehydrates them/shreds them up. I put this in every single humanly possible place in my home and lived in it for a month and a half along with a mattress cover that I also filled with the stuff. Afterwards I used a shop vac on my whole apartment, a spot bot on the mattress and couch, and had a steam cleaner come in and clean the carpets. Not an issue since. If your neighbor won't do much though and the bed bugs are still at her place then gtfo. I truly wish you good luck. Just remember eventually everything will be back to normal and fine, even if it takes months. You got this!"

Held up the entire line to ask for her number with everyone watching. She kept asking if it was a prank but I was 100% serious.

She was 16. 

I accidentally left without my chips and guac and she had to shout my name like 4 times to get my attention as I was leaving. Hardest walk of shame of my life. "
OP just discovered the thesaurus.
Honestly though that would be easier to fix
You thought you were a Cumbender but were sadly pisstaken.
"While this is how it **should** be, we were told at my university that even if you’re both drunk that the guy can be charged with rape. When asked what about the girl, they shrugged it off. Unfortunately people think that if a girl is drunk you’re taking advantage of her but if a guys drunk well, of course he wanted it."
"Based on your last TIFU, I think you secretly have a poop fetish "
"I mean, he succeeded, just in the worst possible way."
Grand Theft burrito.... What a day to be alive. 
"My girl says she doesnt use the restroom anywhere close to the time that we do it, otherwise she's more likely to have an accident. She will go much earlier in the day.

Food for thought. 

Also, you ladies are saints for taking it up the butt for us dudes. Thank you.

She also didn't enjoy it at first either but after several tries experimenting with positions and clit stimulation she loves it.

Don't give up on it!"
Just move to Alabama and you should be fine
"Friend worked at a gas station/convenience store in a bad area. They had a ""below 5$ its free"" deal going with the local cops (mostly donuts, snacks and coffee). Guess how fast 10+ police cars show up when he calls in a disturbance. "
I hope you guys used contraception...
"No, you. "
Imagine how amazing that would be. An accomplice to his shenanigans. haha
I would have ripped whoever added you back to the convo a new asshole. If someone backs out of something don't force them back in

Can't decide if this is worse than the coconut.
That sounds a lot like a paid protection racket lmao
I came here to point out these plot holes as well...
"By any chance, Did you have a clitoral laceration during delivery? Make sure you watch closely for infection- increased pain, redness, swelling, pus, fever or chills. I would let it be for several days without masturbating or stimulating. I'm sure you can find a toy that is not as powerful, I know they sell a vibrator called the Whisper for people who have super sensitive clits and can't handle strong vibration. Also, I would use lube next time to help as well. I'm so sorry this happened to you!"
Same girl ft. Usher by R. Kelly :o
Well shit.
Ummmmmm isn’t it the measuring system YOU invented??
It happens!  You can't throw a party at poop's house and not expect poop to show up every once in a while.
"but like... *why?*

I don't understand why you would want some panties from a dirty ass plane bathroom, if at all. Also, of course it was an old dude. It just HAD to be an old dude, lol."

"&gt;he told me I should take a plea bargain because he wasn’t going to fight for me with me still owing him money 

That borders on legal malpractice. As I'm sure you realize now, you had the wrong lawyer. We live in a surveillance society, but you had no witnesses, phone records, or video footage showing where you were? Or where she was? Three people (you, her, and the pastor's son) disappeared into the ether for nearly 24 hours without a trace. 

Defending you should not have been a huge job but once you took that deal you were screwed. 

For everyone else, get a fucking dash cam. "
Of course he met her again. They're married now.
And that girl was Albert Einstein 
How do you vomit comprehensively? Maybe I've been doing it wrong.
reddit no
"Also add lube, you rubbed it raw and should be ok, but does not hurt to triple check. 
Its not a bad thing if you need lube due to your body being silly"
I also have waxy ears sometimes. It is the worst. The first time it happened I thought I was going deaf in one of my ears (As a musician probably the worst thing that could have happened).
"I could have gone my whole life without seeing the words ""clitoral"" and ""laceration"" put together, but no. You just had to ruin that for me. "
Oh wow. How gruesome. 
"i think that people who are really into butt stuff are secretly poop fetishists

edit: a lotta people in denial about the ""shit"" they're into. go give yourself an alaskan pipeline or something"
But not a true *today* I fucked up

That's a bit drastic don't you think? What if he doesn't consent?
He said high school 
"So you saw a plant you clearly weren't familiar with (y'know, China - you don't live there) on the ground and without thinking injested it.

Downvote me if you must but my man, you are fucking stupid. But it is a lesson learned, and a funny story to tell to friends. And hey!you survived being poisoned. Nice job!"
"Seeing as the clit is basically the female penis, both men and women should find these things pretty painful to read. "
If you paid for that redbox rental hopefully you grabbed it before leaving. I once paid 20ish for a movie I forgot about and never watched. 
unexpectedly wholesome comment on a thread about anal and poop accidents.  
"""DROP THE WEAPON AND COME OUTSIDE WITH YOUR HANDS UP, A REGULAR LATTE AND A JELLY DONUT"""
"Gay guy here.

If anal is a regular part of your sex life, even infrequently, I'd invest in an anal douche. Cleaning well isn't enough. As soon as you stimulate the anus, your body starts releasing. That's what you experienced. 

An anal douche is different than a vaginal douche. And not as dangerous. I know vaginal douching isn't good for women. It looks like a turkey baster yet functions like a water enema. You can get them from most places that sell sex toys.

Its definitely tedious. But taking 20 minutes to squat over a toilet and shoot water up there until it comes out clear can be the difference between sexy times and disaster."
"A coffee shop I go to every day at precisely 8:25 now makes my cappuccino before I walk in, and when I go to pay, the cashier waves me off and says ""I got you"". This has been going on for almost 2 years now. I must have gotten thousands in free coffee by now."
Not as bad as the guy who fucked his dad's couch.
