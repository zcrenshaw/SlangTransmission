Where do you live? 
"**Intro:**  

What I gather from this thread is that you are looking for logical reasoning against your actions, sources to back up evidence-based claims, and generally a conversation surrounding these topics. First off I want to specify that if you were looking for the error in your thinking you are late. Your actions have already made a lasting impact on your daughter's life and while I admit some could be considered positive the whole 99.99% of them should be understood as destructive. Secondly, it is true that in the view of debate it would be on you to provide source material (burden of proof) for your claims. However, with the understanding that scientific law forbids testing in this area and most investigation will be old or hard to find I will do my best in providing source materials for my claims. I hope this keeps us from a ""Lack Of Evidence"" based conversation because this is personally an important subject. Now I will do my best to break down the error in incestuous pedophilic relationships in an organized fashion.  
_________
**Pedophilia**  

-We as a species have developed an intelligence that allows us to see that an action that may be physically pleasurable isn't always beneficial to us as a whole. If the ultimate goal is to be the most dominant species then pumping out babies makes sense and as such having children and pushing sexuality at younger ages could be a method. But we are past that goal and now aim for a different kind of Survival which means battling larger problems (like over-population) and organizing ourselves for better protection. Sex has become this connecting and emotional event probably in response to us forming tribes, Children under the age of 18 (age limit is argued) lack the capacity, life experience, and mental capacity to deal with these emotions in a constructive and healthy manner. You have asked for this to be elaborated so, I would go back to my own childhood. My own choices and emotions were far from clear and thought through. My parents went through a rough divorce and at the time I dealt with many emotions that lead me to blame myself. However, life experience and years of growth have shown me how wrong that was, now I seem to have the capacity to truly think through my emotions. Also, there is great scientific progress in the stages of mental development in children; Cognitive logic, and the emotions of others have not been seen in children prior to ages 7-11. Teaching sex to somebody completely ignorant of others feelings and emotions is unacceptable; its a recipe for creating at best a self-centered lover and at worst a serial rapist.  

-At some point you tried to make the comparison that preference is all that is needed in a sexual relationship
  
  &gt; Something regarding either pizza or a burrito 

Which I am honestly baffled you fail to see the err in. These are wildly different decisions; having sex and being intimate with someone is one that should be taken seriously with thought and emotional reflection even though society allows for things like one-night stands these too should be taken just as seriously. I wish to ask you what would your reaction be if your daughter at 3 or 4 did tell you how wrong your actions are. How destructive these relations have been to her; let's also pretend she did not elaborate on these thoughts backing it up only with a gut feeling. again How would you react to that?  

-Now I don't want to attack the process of talking to your children about sex and intimate relation, studies show that starting early can have a positive impact on how they review their learning experiences later on in life, plus it protects them from molestation when they are told about what is acceptable and what isn't. 
______
**Incestuous**  

-Society knows and understands these mental incapabilities and restricting sex at those ages is only an attempt to protect them from making rash decisions, that we remember ourselves making at those ages, and letting it change their lives forever. Another big issue with Adult and child relationships (especially with parental figures) is the overt and unavoidable power inequalities. Teaching a child about sex by acting on personal attractions to them has a real domination issue. Children completely trust adults in there lives and studies have shown this is extremely true prior to the critical skeptic phase of mental capacity. This shows that children could only learn that sex is supposed to be this dominating or submissive process, rather than a healthy neutral (or at least varied) experience that they learn from having these experiences with similarly aged partners later in life. (Sources: can't find it now but there is a good study by Vikram Jaswal at the University of Virginia about adult trust *Maybe Psychological Science published)   

-This also ignores that incredibly negative effect incestuous relationships have on our species as a whole. I personally never had any incestuous inclinations when I was a child, however I know others that like you felt some vague attraction to a cousin or had a curious thought about a sibling; these were (to my knowledge) unacted upon feelings and emotions that they later eventually had dissected discovering issues with their development and or events that where happening in their lives at the time. If some adult had pushed these feelings at that time it's possible they would have acted on those feelings spreading the harm further and possibly making life changing mistakes. Is incestuous relationships something you want to teach your kid is okay both personally and to prepare them for the world. 
____
**Generally**  

-You seem to not harbor very negative feelings about your early sexual experiences with the ""Adult figure."" Do you think it is possible the lack of a father figure made you susceptible to abuse by an adult. It seems possible by lacking the healthy father/child relationship, when you were abused it gave you a warped very dominating concept of what a father is that you have now used to fuel your actions as a father yourself. I completely understand though the difficulty in seeing the error in your ways. Not only would it require a critical mind molded by healthy adult relationships, but think of the effect you being wrong has had on your daughter. To accept a failure on your part would also be accepting the failure of your previous abuser, any actions since then, and a failure as a father. Because of this, I feel the need to at least give you my advice, you will more than likely refuse to see any specialist about this issue as I see CPS (or a non American alternative) being called fairly quickly (though this often depends on the doctor themselves). As such I recommend seeing a therapist about your childhood instead, or in general. Having them help you go over your emotions regarding your early abuse and/or about life in general is extremely worthwhile for all people. My only hope other then your personal well being is that in this self-focused therapy you gain the strength and self-criticism to see how wrong you are. 
___
**TL;DR** Children go through stages of cognitive development, as such they are not mentally prepared to deal with the emotions that come with an incestuous phedophilic relationship. Regardless the last thing you want to teach a member of our species is that ""It's okay because it feels good."" There are extremely clear issues with teaching sex in situations with such aggressive power inequalities. Incestuous relationships are extremely unhealthy even from a purely biological standpoint and teaching it as ""okay"" from a young age is a recipe for disaster. Please understand that your experiences as a child while positive in your eyes has likely warped your view of reality and for you to see you are wrong in this will take a great amount of self-reflection and will power. However, do not wait and let your daughter be the one to tell you when she is old enough. Seek phsycological help now, regardless if you feel justified.

"Unbelievable. 

Children cannot consent to sexual interaction. 

Fuck you, you vile piece of shit. "
Such an underrated question! I hope OP answers!
Username DOES NOT check out.
"Can someone please report this piece of shit ?

"Hmmm, 

Ever see Jurassic Park? I mean... I assume you have. It was, in the end, a story about the hubris of authority - that we can craft and create and determine outcomes on behalf of others. The belief that we can be Gods.

In reading this thread, it seems evident that you believe that your daughter's future can be controlled. That's hubris. And it's hubris because you don't get to control the relationship between your daughter and the world. Once she reaches a certain age, she'll have to face the facts about her life.

From reading this thread, I can make a few inferences. Hopefully they bear out. But I presume that you've been in contact with a community of pedophiles. In that I can infer that you've probably been in contact with people who were sexualized as children and turned out more or less fine. Perhaps they even seem, in some curious way, enlightened about society's knee-jerk reaction to their experience. A reaction that says their parents were evil and they *must* be broken humans - because how else could it be? That simply *must* be the case (they think) because if it weren't then how could we justify the vitriol for pedophilia on display in this thread? 

So, perhaps your beliefs reference experience where the supposed ""victims"" of pedophilia recall having loving relationships with their parents. Maybe some of them are still close with their parents and have gone on to lead normal lives. If that's the case, then the whole anti-pedophilia movement is based on fallacies. You have evidence based experience, they have conjecture.

I can also see that you're highly, highly rational. You deal with everything through intellectualization.

So, I think you'll hear me when I say that one thing you have done - undeniably - is facilitate an irreversible path for your daughter. You have done this while being a caregiver, and not trusting that she can therefore make responsible life decisions such that she could live independently of you. You have facilitated an irreversible life of secrecy and lies. Your daughter is now an alien. Her experience is incommensurable with that of her peers, her teachers, her friends, her future lovers, her coworkers, her guides. She will live every moment of every day being a secret outsider; an *other* - holding beliefs and experiences that nobody else holds; making decisions using reasoning that nobody else uses; trying to *act* normal when normal was never an option.

We live in a world that routinely wounds and kills its children. Suicide is an epidemic among our youth. Social media and the rapid pace of technology is creating a generation with no identity, no solid foundation. It causes desperate youth to self-harm, to self medicate, to take drugs with no labels that were invented weeks prior, to perform life altering stunts for likes. A world where TV reality show hosts threaten nuclear war with fat caricatures of foreigners; where reality is untenable; where the news is all fake; where nothing and NOBODY can be counted on as a reliable guide.

Your daughter must survive all of that - and she must now do it with a secret.

You have upped the difficulty exponentially for her life. And you have done so because **you** believe that you can control what happens; because you have rationalized your own alienation into a panacea for what's wrong with the world.

But you can't. *That* is hubris. 

You're a cocky, self-indulgent narcissist who has spent thousands and thousands of hours justifying his own alienation - and as a result you've made a decision for your daughter *to make her like you*. Because *you* have managed to convince yourself that you're better than everyone else, because you're smart and successful and caring and loving and *a good person* - so how could the fact that you're *also* a pedophile be wrong? 

You have deprived your daughter of freedom. You made her choice. You will *force* her to face *your* demons, to carry them without *any* support (aside from yours, I suppose - what convenient surprise).

Maybe she will turn out fine. Maybe she will turn out a brilliant and loving human - like I'm sure you think you are. But whoever she becomes - it will be because you made a decision that forces her to live in secrecy, isolation and in opposition to the society that she must thrive in and depend on. 

And if it goes wrong? If the fence fails and the raptors come to eviscerate her soul because she has such an incredibly hurculean task *on top of everything else she has to deal with*?

Then that will be because of your hubris. And if she fails, falters, suffers or dies - it *will* be because you're the John Fucking Hammond of this story.

But something tells me... You'll blame the dinosaurs for the deaths of the innocents; and you'll blame society for the suffering your daughter endures. 

Your daughter will blame you.

"
"I'm not being funny here, but I keep reading that you ""don't see it as wrong"". Well, I fucking do.

The reason it is wrong is because children's bodies and minds are not developed enough to either have relations with an adult, or choose to.

You are a sick individual, probably borne out of being a victim yourself - and I urge you to seek urgent medical help.

And if you refuse, you're a cunt."

"Your username is wrong. You are a horrible dad and when your daughter grows up, she will despise you. "
Done.
"I get hugs from my three year old son, and my seven year old daughter. I hug my wife from behind and kiss her neck while she’s making dinner. Then I talk to my kids about their day while I pet my dogs. My son and I usually end up having a tickle fight which results in a tickle fight between the two kids and I. That goes on until they call mom for Help then she comes to their rescue. 

Then we all eat and my wife and I talk about our days. "
"It said that he wanted to make sure his wife was okay with him molesting his daughter and that she wouldn’t view it as cheating because if she did, it might cause their daughter *distress* to know that she had been a participant in an affair.

I wish I was fucking kidding."
"Good reply, deservedly harsh and yet not emotional. You facted the shit out of him"
"He said he's been molesting his daughter since she was born......and also claimed that her baby noises should count as consent. He then went on to argue that he should be allowed to give consent on her behalf, as her father....for himself to rape her... I think I've had enough internet forever."
"Confirmed lost cause 👍🏼

Sorry for your life. I hope the best for your daughter. "
Is your wife okay with you having a sexual relationship with your daughter?
"&gt; She lived in Mexico so she just disappeared.

ay dios mio"
Who are your 3 ideal sexual partners?
I hope you’re just trolling. I can’t believe you’re trying to justify being a pedophile. Horrible human being.
What's you full name and address?
"One day soon you will be caught and your daughter will hate you more than she's ever hated anyone in the world. Maybe this post will be what gets you caught but more likely it will be her accidentally letting it slip to some one, unless of course you keep her away from everyone outside of your little family which you probably do but all it takes is one person. You'll be in the news and we will all know who you are. We will see the face of a pathetic little man.

She did not peruse you. Stop lying. No one here believes that "
"Didn't they track down some Isis dude and drone him in real time during an AMA?


It's the least we can do for this dude eh?"
"If by ""they"" you mean 4chan then yes, they also tracked a pedophile and got him arrested."

"Whenever I get stressed out, I try to think about roadside memorials. Those memorials are for people who died in route to somewhere. Someone was expecting them to arrive and they never did.

The LGBTQ community doesn't do that. You disgusting piece of shit.

You know what? I'm choosing to believe you're a troll. Your responses and complete disregard for right and wrong cannot be real.
"Because children have died from intercourse with adults. Google it.

And because children cannot decide what Tellytubby is their favourite, let alone whether they want to have sex with someone.

Children are taught different topics at school. They cannot understand algebra at age 6 for example, therefore algebra is taught at a higher age. Children should also be taught about sex when they fucking understand it - not when you want it."
"Of course, just like everyone else"
What's the first thing you would do if your SO and kids died in a horrible accident?

"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/murderedbywords] [Pedophile gets bodied by redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/7ui20i/pedophile_gets_bodied_by_redditor/)

&amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*"
"I've read the threads in here and your responses. So from what I can gather, you understand that this is not 'normal', you just don't seem to care. That's sociopathic behavior to a T. People are asking you questions, yet you dodge giving answers by either referencing 'research it' or that you 'don't understand' what is being asked. It's not 'sheeple' mentality to know that what you are doing is morally and ethically wrong, and you seem to not be able to accept the fact that indoctrination is a real thing.

You had mentioned that you were abused as a child, so you think it's okay to abuse others. That is mentality that is common in other abusers. Do you think what they're doing is worse than what you're doing?

I can tell you that indoctrination is a real thing, from a personal experience from a friend who is a judge. She had a case where a girls dad was abusing her, and she kept a journal about it. Early in the journal, she writes 'I hate this, and it hurts, and I don't want to see daddy again,' bit after months go on, the journal then reads 'I hope daddy comes over and sticks his pee pee in me again.'

You have a warped sense of reality and refuse to accept the fact that you may, in fact, be in the wrong. The long term damage your daughter will sustain from this is seeing it as normal, and she will seek it out, probably even as an adult. You think she's going to be able to have a normal dating life? You think that, if this gets out, she's going to be able to have friends? You keep saying that this is not the case, but where is your proof? You are making the claim, the burden of proof lies on you. Nearly the entire scientific and psychological community agrees here, that it's abuse, she is not mature enough to consent because she is not aware of what sex actually is.

You have really not answered anything, you've dodged questions and played mental gymnastics while claiming some kind of logical victory, while not actually giving any information. AMA stands for 'ask me anything' because it's expected that you'll get an answer. It's not 'ask me anything and I'll give you some smarmy response that does nothing to actually further my belief.'

I've narrowed this down to two things:
You're an internet troll who is trying to get a rise out of people, or you're someone who's moral barometer is so off the mark that you cannot accept anything except for what you've already been indoctrinated with by your mother, thus you thinking it was your own original idea and you thinking that it's okay.

Either way, understand that this is not normal, this is abuse, and you should seek help. Morality is defined by society around us, and what is and isn't acceptable behavior. And this is not acceptable behavior "
Who are you currently sleeping with?
Did you fuck my wife?
"I hope you somehow get tracked through your account and get caught, you’re disgusting."
"This was my initial thought, but the account has become incredibly detailed and carries very real hallmarks of serious abuse. The way that he's justified his actions and imagined the complicity and consent of his daughter and wife - while noting they understand the ""consequences"" if they were to tell - is so chillingly real that if he isn't telling the truth, he still has a deep psychological understanding of an abuser.

It's gone beyond edgy teen, at very least into the realms of an adult whose mind is consumed by this fantasy, and quite possibly in the realm of it being 100% real."
"It does in the sense that ""bad"" would be a grotesque understatement."
"So the difference between us is I don't have a personal bias. I know for a fact, due to experience, that children can't consent so you should know this too, yet you refuse to believe it so you can continue to commit rape without regret."
"I can’t wait till the FBI blows through your door, throws your disgusting piece of shit body on the floor, kneels on the back of your neck and puts you in chains like the heinous creature you are. You do not deserve liberty. You deserve a 5x5 concrete cell with a scheduled ass-kicking morning noon and night. 

Your lifestyle is untenable, your reasoning delirious, and your existence a waste. Your family deserves to see your last breath, and soon. You are, without a doubt, one of the lowest forms of existence. Please, resist when the authorities come calling. Run at them. Anything expedite your ceasing to exist. 

As for your daughter, I hope while you stare at the cold, gray walls of your cell, that you realize the innocence that you’ve corrupted. I hope that you realize the putrid, demonic state of mind one must regress to in order to behave as you’ve described. But you won’t. Your mind suffers from a sickness from which it cannot break free. 

You absolutely sicken me. Burn."
The brain is nowhere near developed enough to be able to make those decisions.
"In what way is your sexualisation of a non-consenting, innocent young child “to her benefit”?"
"Ha ha, you're good, I'll give you that!

However, it is illegal, and scientific studies show that it is damaging to physical and mental health. Therefore, the onus is NOT on me to prove why it is wrong. It is on you to prove why it's not wrong. And reading your comments, you're not doing a good job!"
"Yeah. Apparently she was sleeping with my brother too (he’s a year older and had his own room). So my brother found out about us through her and she wanted the whole thing to end so my bro told my parents about it. She lived in Mexico so she just disappeared.

My mother is very uncomfortable talking about sex so she didn’t really talk to me about it. She just had me go through check-ups and talk to other professional people about it.

My dad was incredibly upset, especially at my mom (parents divorced when I was 2). He told me it wasn’t my fault and that I shouldn’t be ashamed of myself."
"At the time I knew it was wrong but I let my lust get the better of me and I always felt extreme guilt and shame after sex. After we had sex the first time it was like a drug and I just kept coming back for it. 

I’m mostly over it to the point where I don’t mind telling friends, but recently I told some friends about it and they’re reaction to it made me feel somewhat guilty and shameful again hence I decided to do this AMA in an attempt to get those feelings out of my head."
I guess Vlad got his name for a reason eh?
"assuming you are for real, what would it actually take you to accept that what you have done and are doing is wrong? reading through this thread, most of your reasoning consists of wilful ignorance, denial and mental gymnastics. it takes two minutes to search ""child sexual trauma"" on google scholar - have a read and stop trying to pass off the burden of proof.

You’re fucking stupid. Babies cannot give consent and here you are molesting one. I feel bad for your daughter. She’s going to grow up and enter the real world traumatized by your actions.

There are many ways to show love, raping children is definitely not one of them. You are a horrible, disgusting person."

She can't even think about life goals beyond the latest superhero movie she saw, she is biologically incapable. The lack of physical ability to consent alone makes you immoral."

You WILL experience life changing consequences from this behavior.

My experience working with sexual abuse survivors is enough for me to see the extreme and severe effects of abuse and incest. The research in the area of sexual abuse survivors is so conclusive that it has become widely accepted across all areas of medicine and mental health.

What the fuck
"You're the only type of person I judge. Disgusting pieces of shit scum you sickos are. Your poor daughter, if all this is true. Keeping in mind you might be trolling. This is the internet after all. "
"Makes me wonder what your parents were thinking. If a 24 year old woman slept in my room when I was 14, I imagine I'd be crazy with horniness every night! Any chance they figured maybe she'd ""break you in"" with your first sexual experience? "
So that she could have a bed to sleep in. My family likes to have a housekeeper almost 24/7. All the other rooms of the house were taken so it was either that or sleep on the couch. Before I was 12 we would actually sleep in the same bed.
You're a bad dad
Can you show that a baby girl wants to be fucked?
How would you describe your girlfriend's boobs?
Talk me through the average 30 minutes of your life when you first get home from work. 
Hey man you’ve got a great life. Be proud of it. 
"Weathered and spotted, resembling that of an aged reptile or a wrinkled, dry piece of pig skin"
"In honor of my younger siblings, the years of therapy, and the countless dreams I have of strangling my own father. Fuck you."
"I know, never underestimate the power of retards with too much free time."
My take it's an edgy kid using TOR.  I want to believe that anyway.

"A lot of the crew members are dating/married, a few of my cast mates were in those kinds of relationships. Other than that though, there’s still plenty of hanky panky, as you put it. My friends and I would always ask “where did you go last night”, to find out the nationality of the person you slept with. "
Non-exclusive meaning that other things get you off besides children?
Make a wish
"A good chunk of my time working prize counter for the arcade was teaching other people’s kids how to count. This was a local arcade, not a Chuck E. Cheese or other franchise joint, and a LOT larger than Chuck E. Cheese on the inside with a lot more kids coming in and out. There was usually only one of us at the prize counter at a time, and we only had one “ticket eater”, so lines would form like crazy and kids with 5 tickets would end up waiting behind kids with 500 for LOOOONG periods of time, ESPECIALLY if the kid in front of them is an indecisive little shit who can’t count and keeps asking for items they don’t have the tickets for.

When a 3 year old comes up without their parent with a handful of tickets, it’s a little easier to justify having to walk them through what prizes they can and can’t get. Another good thing about kids that young is that you don’t have to elongate the process by asking them “what color?/what flavor?” for each item they pick. If you give them a blue life saver they don’t argue against it, you’re the authority on prizes and they’re just happy to have something. It’s when 2nd and 3rd grade kids come up to you unattended and pull that shit, then take five hours deciding exactly what color or flavor they want, that really gets grating. That’s when lines get crazy, especially when we would have parties and all of the kids in the carpool would come up at once. If you’re 9 years old, you’re genuinely expected to know that 10 is less than 50, or that your friends are going to hate you if you spend 20 minutes in front of them deciding what to spend your 5 tickets on.

I also recently got into the habit of wearing a few pop culture pins on my uniform when I’m working at the roller rink because we get a lot of teens in and I’d kill for someone around my age to come up to me and spark a conversation about one of them so I don’t strangle someone after the 50th parent comes up to me and says they don’t know their kids shoe size. A 10 year old boy told me he was a Genji main today. I think that kid takes the cake."
"Yeah, 4chan kinda uses the line between good and evil as a jump rope. I don't know how I feel about them."
What would it take for you to kill a baby?
I really don’t like the quotations around ‘live’
Why did you join a Satanic Cult?
"As ex self harmer myself, congratulations!! 💜💛"
This man is utter garbage. His poor daughter. 
"Nah just saving my time for someone who isn’t looking for attention from their GRRROOOOSSSS fantasies. 

I can post some dumb “I’m a cannibal ama” and come up with bullshit answers too if I didn’t have a life worth living. Someone who does or wants to fuck prepubescent children have literally no reason to live "
Why was she sleeping in your room?
"Well I mostly wear flip flops when I take the trash out. I have an exciting and awesome life. I have a great family, I’m a human being, my parents had sex when they did, and I live in the United States. "
"I'm assuming you mean what changed in my lifestyle and how I implemented the changes, so I'll answer accordingly:

1. I booked into my local doctor's office and get a referral to see a psychologist/psychotherapist (not a psychiatrist). This was probably the most important step that I took. DO NOT be scared, ashamed, nervous to do so - there's no shame in seeking help.

2. Learn about Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Mindfulness Therapy (ACT) as well as meditation.

3. From then, it took me a while to find the right speed to implement life changes so that I was challenged to make a change but not to the point of burning out. 

4. Set yourself small, achievable daily tasks that allow you to feel a sense of accomplishment but not to the extent when you become depleted of energy. The best kind of goal for me to start with is to make my bed each day. If you're having trouble getting out of bed, then maybe you goal would be to open your blinds/curtains and let natural light enter the room. Each day, complete you task and incrementally add extra tasks on top of it until you feel like you're able to control.

5. Begin your day with some light exercise. If your depression is keeping you in bed all day, I would suggest trying to commit to a 10-20 minute walk each morning. This will boost your endorphins and give you a sense of accomplishment.

6. Eat well. Healthy foods, vegetables, fruit. I also have recently tried intermittent fasting and eliminating as much gluten as possible from my diet, which has made a really great change. I highly recommend trying it.

7. Try to either cut back of temporarily eliminate drugs and alcohol from you diet. Alcohol is especially bad at keeping depression around. It's not categorised as a ""depressant"" for nothing. 

8. Get outside and see people as much as possible.

9. This falls into #2, but challenge all your negative thoughts. Try to catch yourself when you're ruminating and develop strategies to take your mind of things.

It will be up to either your doctor or psychiatrists (as well as your own) discretion as to whether you decide to take anti-depressant or other drugs too.
