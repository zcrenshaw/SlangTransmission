"Is your favorite Nintendo the Wii U or the Wii, U?"
Switch
Why? 
Missed opportunities OP. Could have called your throwaway account throwaway_pants2018
Your last name isn't Madbro is it?
"""Not a valid username"""
"Have you realized that your life is about to become an anime? If so, what have you done to prevent yourself from becoming a protagonist?"
BECAUSE IT'S FUCKING COLD
"Thats my entire primary school life. Other puns include ""YOUUUUUU"" - Soulja boy, ""All I want for christmas is ... U"", and various other cringe inducing ones. "
"I can prove it to the mods, if they really need verification for this one..."
Good joke.
Why ain't your username u/u? 
Yeah usually happens when I wake up but it only lasts until I go back to sleep
"B.C. here, I want to clarify that not all of Canada drinks their milk from plastic milk bladders and a good portion of us find it in fact weird."
‚ÄúUm...put it on! And I‚Äôm gonna be Sauron. And I want a costume where I can be Sauron. Ok mama?‚Äù
I live in India and buy milk straight outta the cow.
Every new person I meet tries to pun my name it barely affects me anymore.
"UPDATE:
I have arrived at the destination. Went in the back door and ran to the bathroom. Ripped the pants off to find a shit filled, mucus like mess in the back region of my boxers. The smell was *awful*. There‚Äôs no way that came out of my body, I‚Äôm still in awe. I cleaned up whatever mess was left with some wet wipes to realize I forgot the most vital part of the operation-the fresh pair of undies. I had to do what any sane person would, grabbed a bottle of febreeze and sprayed my ass and pants. I walked out, and aside from the strong smell of febreeze, nobody seemed too bothered. Although I am sitting alone on the other side of the room because everyone has separated themselves from me. 4/10 experience, but I learned a lot so I‚Äôm happy it happened. "
Thats concerning
"We normally get a 35% discount on any merchandise when we're employed there. We also get around 4 free tickets every 3 months we work to take anyone we'd like into the parks. Free admission and parking for ourselves of course, and 15% off third-party stores in CityWalk and for food carts."

"it started out how a normal person would shit their pants. I try to eat healthy, but we stopped at a mcdonalds for lunch and I pigged out. 30 minutes later I was letting out soft farts until one of them got stuck. Started pushing really hard until I heard a ‚ÄúFFFLGGRRGGGGGGG‚Äù and a wet feeling in my asscrack. That‚Äôs when I knew."
‚ÄúI just wanna be Sauron!‚Äù
Haha!! He also thinks the orcs are funny and his friends. So maybe I‚Äôm raising a dark lord after all.
Dude. Throw the underwear away. Clean your ass best you can and just wear pants. It's gonna feel weird but at least you'll be clean and won't smell of shit and febreeze.
Did the race perk of nord help you with this
"I lold. You are a good sport, U."
"Do you have any tips for, say, someone who has also shit their pants recently and has an hour until they‚Äôre home?
Asking for a friend"
Hey U!

"No, but some fellow witches and wizards do. I'm just there to do my best job at helping people have a great time."
Rock music I hope?

"Its Hinduism. But my parents are really into numerology and phonetics. It takes a full 9 months of trying and consulting to come up with a name that is unique. My full name is one of a kind, which makes it easy for anyone to look me up online."
"Welcome to the club. 

Engineering degree and finance postgraduate both at top unis. 

Now work in sales for minimum wage, 6 years of working 14 hours a day for 7 days a week at uni just wiped out all my motivation and energy.  

I think the one advice I can give you is to remember that 99% of achievements in life come outside of the work place. 

So what goals do you have for 2018 outside of your work life? "
"Yes. For many years I had days that were just low. I woke up and wanted  to not be there anymore. It was not  easy. But I found strategies to fight it. And then implementes habits that keep me away from those lows. In the beginning it was hard work every day. But now it is just my life and I can't even remember my last really low day.

I hope you'll find a way to deal with it and to overcome those depressive episodes. All the best!"
Are you a tits or ass kinda guy?
Has anyone ever tried to build a bridge out of you?
"***shits pants*** 

*I'm going to post this to Reddit*"
Nice. We can say ‚ÄúHow is U doing? ‚Äú
"Not a mod.  But please verify.  Also, why.  "
"No, U."
"Do you get annoyed when people call it, ""Harry Potter Land""?"
Of course we do! Us folks in Diagon Alley are respectful witches and wizards. I can‚Äôt speak for those that are in Knockturn Alley though... ü§î
Be there for them. Call. Text. Check up. Help them get out of bed. Watch silly shows that make them smile. Encourage them to choose to get better. No one can heal them but themselves. Tell them they‚Äôre strong enough and worth it.
"the only reaction so far has been
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that smell‚Äù
‚ÄúProbably just something outside‚Äù
‚ÄúGross‚Äù"
"I been working for 6 months so far in there and it‚Äôs hard to recall every odd question, but my favorite questions that I get are ‚ÄúWhere do y‚Äôall sell the magic sticks?‚Äù I also have really terrible memory so I don‚Äôt remember a lot of the guest interactions. I remember one time a lady gave me a business card for her service animal and it was the cutest thing ever."
Because why not. 
"Don‚Äôt sit on it, open a window and have a plan for the future."
I doubt the original Sauron would have asked his mom before he forged the one ring. I'd say your little dude is ahead of the curve.

No it's not. OP lives in Hong Kong. It's never cold there. His water is likely quite warm. Fake news.
How many showers did you have to take to stop being hesitant about just getting in?
I guess I should start. How are you? 
hopefully someone shits themselves again over the next 9 months just for this moment
"If [kid] had the One Ring, what would he do with it?"
"Well, there are 6 types of butterbeer. Cold, Frozen, Warm, Ice Cream, Butter Potted Cream, and Fudge. 
I've only had the actual drink once, just to try it out and I've had the ice cream because a fellow witch shared!"

What are the odds of that
"Listen to them op. As the proud recipient of a BA in art history, I second this. Just take all the electives but don't major in it. I've never once used it in a professional setting and I worked in a gallery for 4 years. "
"Ahh... Fuck it I‚Äôm just gonna say it.

Kid, major in something that is actually gonna give you the most likely chance of landing a job. Art or literature are not the ones. "
I am so glad that's what you meant. uuuuf!
"Funny you ask cause I‚Äôve actually planned this out.

We‚Äôre seeing family so I‚Äôm going to run into the house and pull the ‚Äúlong trip have to use the bathroom‚Äù before I greet anyone. I‚Äôm going to bring my suitcase in, wipe everything down, change underwear and shorts and put the old underwear in a bag. Sometime in the middle of the night I‚Äôll transport this bag over to a trash can where I‚Äôll stuff it under old trash."
"That's OK. People do it all the time. I am onto my 2nd career change since I graduated and I'm not even 40 yet. Although I have to say - if you're low on money or have student loans to pay, then get whatever job you need and grind it out until you're financially capable to pursue your passion. "

"‚ÄúFrodo!‚Äù

He hasn‚Äôt seen the Hobbit movies yet, but my husband showed him scenes of Smaug in his phone, and he‚Äôs excited to see it."
My parents are Hindu and believe  in numerology and phonetology which basically means they convert letters to numbers and add them up to get an auspicious number. Also they input phonetically powerful syllables into the name to improve future success in the individual. My name adds up to the number 1. (maximum of 9) and it apparently meant ill be the best at whatever I do.
Because it's a mind numbingly boring job. I picked it being money motivated and not knowing what I wanted. 
"Probably shouldn't put his real name here, even if it is just the first name."
"Probably won't change it, I am who I am because of it. No point changing it"
Pottermore has sorted me into Slytherin and I love embracing the inner snake in me! I have yet to get sorted by the Sorted Hat that they bring once a year :( maybe next year I‚Äôll request a day off and do it
"I quit my old job as a barista and wanted to work in the Simpsons area with my friend in merchandise.

Can we call you an Appalasian? 
"Hard to count because every day we watch one extended disk and it‚Äôs always out of order. I asked him what his favorite scene is.

‚ÄúUm...when the orcs try to eat Merry and Pippin.‚Äù"
"Who is his favourite character? Has he seen the Hobbit movies too?

I'm in med school so I guess I turned out alright.
I‚Äôm sure that shit gets old after a while

Do you get any cool perks for working there? 
"The hiring process was actually really laid back. They asked me what my favorite production of Universal Studios was, and I was just honest and told them ‚ÄúI would love to give an answer but unfortunately I don‚Äôt watch too many movies and I‚Äôm more into gaming‚Äù they were very understanding about it. Of course, like a normal interview, they would ask about your past work experience and such. Also I got hired with 0 knowledge about Harry Potter. When you get hired, depending on what type of job you get hired for, they give you 2-3 days of orientations to attend. Potter has a mandatory orientation called the ‚ÄúPotter Orientation‚Äù that you have to attend just so you have a little knowledge about the subject."
Do you feel like you are raising your lil brother?
They know.
He IS tasty ;)
I have somehow learnt to tell the different between a regular you and when someone is trying to call me. It's a weird sense.
"I'll let you in on 10 secrets of the asian nail salons.

1. Most workers are here illegal and get paid under the table.  If they have a license they bought one.  (somebody can go take the class and test for you under your name, it costs about $3000 to buy it) or they are using somebody else's license with a fake id.
2. Most nails salon use MMA acrylic liquid.  The Reason they use MMA is because it is 10x cheaper.  If they are using a big brush to get the liquid and the liquid is dark purple instead of light purple then it's MMA and stay away it will damage your nails.
3.  The implements are probably not being disinfected properly they probably just washed it with soap and water in the sink and that's it.  It needs to be immersed in disinfectant for 10 minutes to be completely free of bacteria virus and fungus.
4. Some say they are doing liquid gel for you but actually do acrylic liquid gel has no smell and is put under a UV light to cure.
5. The pedicure tub is supposed to be cleaned with soap and water and then run water with 1 cup of bleach in it for 10 mins.  Nail salons are too busy so they don't do it.
6. Nail technicians are not allowed to get out ingrown toenails or cut into skin
7. sorry to say this but they prefer not to do ""my den"" or black american.  They tend to go for the the cheaper basic services, they normally require more work on their feet, tend to be more picky and are normally bad tippers or no tip at all
8.  They reuse buffer blocks and files, ask for a new one!
9. drill bits have to be disinfected after every use but they dont
10. you can send a complaint about a nail salon on your states cosmetic board website they have to come check for any complaint"
Without hesitation he said ‚Äúthe one ring!‚Äù
"Bic is the only way to go for disposable lighters.

I dont even see how the shitty lighter company even stays in buisness. 

For all we know they went out of buisness 20 years ago and they're still trying to get rid of all the shitty lighters they couldnt sell."
Yes. In my balls.
Do you weigh as much as a duck?
"Being able to quantify and understand risk is probably one of the most important -- if not the most important -- component of any company. Your degree is not worthless; your resume just isn't ending up in front of the right people. Actuarial field is super niche, yes, but equally crucial and helpful. I mean insurance companies can't even function without actuaries."

"Haha they are so cheap, they usually give me a free one with a pack of cigs at my smoke shop.

About three to four showers. 
"What is the strangest, most outlandish question a tourist has ever asked you?

"Late to the game, as usual."
He just shook his head. So apparently no. It‚Äôs not a mine.
Just completely change clothes.  Say you felt sweaty and gross.
"Does it ever go away.? 

Another survivor here, although it doesn‚Äôt always feel like it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve overcome. Instead, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs always with me. I still have that nagging thought, like I want to die. I‚Äôm not at risk, I‚Äôm not pulling any stunts, or taking action to end my own life - I don‚Äôt want to let down my fianc√©e, my family, or the kids that I teach. This might sound selfish, but the main reasons I keep going now aren‚Äôt for me, they‚Äôre for the people that would hurt, or be let down if I left that way. 

Does it ever go away? Wanting to die, I mean. Feeling like you‚Äôre alive because you‚Äôve been guilt tripped, or peer pressured to stay alive. Does it go away, or does it just get easier? Or is it just a struggle every day?"
"Not the person who asked but I have advice, if you want to not be a protagonist in an anime then avoid unconventional hair colors, it way save you from a life of having to fight evil monsters."
"To overcome acute depressive episodes: I tried to comfort myself with a shower or bath with a movie (I told myself to go shower and afterwards I can go back to bed), depending on my mood and time of the year, make myself a cup of tea, go for a walk / to a strawberry or flower field to pick some berries or flowers, if I was able to find comfort in a friendship (I was very lucky I had an amazing roommate for a while), but that was the hardest part for me, I was generally looking for being alone.

My habits, that I implemented over the years:

‚Ä¢no alcohol

‚Ä¢sleep enough (go to bed early, get up around 7)

‚Ä¢eat well, everything in moderation, no overeating, no starving. Start ever day with a breakfast

‚Ä¢leave the house once a day. If possible go for a walk or even a run. But see something of the world.

‚Ä¢clean: a clean house is a clean mind and if you do clean and tidy up on a regular basis, you won't be overwhelmed by loads and loads of laundry...

‚Ä¢positivity journal: every evening I write down (really write it down, pen and paper or a document on the computer), what was good, what I enjoyed or what I'm grateful for on this day. It makes me focus on the positive things and the day ends with something nice.

‚Ä¢I'm sure there were more but I can't recall, it's been a few years..

Of course you can still go party. Of course you can still go to the all you can eat buffet and indugle - once in a while! And if you're down already, bad habits won't get you out of the mood. I was deep in it and I knew I needed a radical change. So I decided to quit negative things completely for a while. I ended up not drinking for two years, quit smoking, ate lots of veggies and so on. If you have a ""real"" depression, this alone won't work and you'll need professional help (which I also had!) and maybe medication. But it is a start.

Oh, and what helped a lot: declutter! I made it a years project: every month I'll throw out / give away / use up 10 items (3 books count as one item). I have away maybe half of my belongings and felt so relieved. My things seemed to suffocate me, but not anymore. I realized also, when I buy things, I just fill the clear space again that I just worked hard for. So I stopped buying things (only replace if broken and really needed). I saved TONS of money. I saved up so much, I was able to travel for half a year on two continents and (lemme count) 8 countries. And the trip helped a lot too, I became so confident in myself and grew as a person. Well... You see, it started with some smaller changes and it started rolling like an avalanche. Tiny steps first, big life change later. I do recommend to not tackle all at once. Start with one change today, add the next one in two months, then another in four... When you're used to change things you can add more here and there. But if you can start over every two months it's not too hard if you ""fail"" at one. Just make the next one better!

I wish you all the best, smile a lot and stay positive!"
"Huh, interesting! I'm from Ontario and just assumed this was a Canada-wide thing. "
"If you just sit around and get high, nothing will change. Nobody else will change your life for you. You actually have to get off your high ass and your high chair of self-pity!

Find out what kind of job your personality will suit, research what is required for that job, take necessary action to get qualified for that job, if lack of experience is your only problem then get summer job or anything within that field, even consider unpaid internships, moving to a location with better job oportunities etc.. apply for jobs you are only 50% qualified for, or jobs you might consider yourself over qualified for but hopefully within the field of your desired job. But work any low-end job in the meantime to get your ass outside and meet the world. And it's okay to work a low end job rest of your life, a job is just a means to an end, not everybody can have fulfilling jobs.

Ask people to hang out with you, chances are some old friends still wants to hang out but people are in general not good at asking others so if you are lonely, take action and do something about it. Find somewhere to meet new people. Take a walk in the park, get out of your house. 
Can you do this?"
"‚ÄúThe ring has to be destroyed!‚Äù 

I asked him again and he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna say anything.‚Äù"
"Yeah!! It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúThe Celebration of Harry Potter‚Äù and it happens once a year, at the last weekend of January. It‚Äôs really cool because all the super fans go and cosplay, so it‚Äôs a really nice experience working that weekend because you get to interact with all the people that are stoked to be there. During that weekend, they usually introduce new merchandise and products. This year they made baby versions of the H &amp; R sweaters and also introduced F &amp; G for Fred and George!"
That's what love is.
So honest question why do you not try to get a job in your field?
Typical Ontario...thinks that if it happens in Ont it happens world wide.
