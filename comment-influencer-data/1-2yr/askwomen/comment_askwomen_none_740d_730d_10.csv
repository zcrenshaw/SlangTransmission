"Not strictly speaking me... but my husbands sister makes cakes. She made a wedding cake for a middle aged couple (on the brides second marriage) &amp; drove almost 2 hours to deliver it. 
Anyway, the groom got so drunk before the ceremony that the registrar refused to marry the couple. The registrar offered to come back and hour later to try again. However, the groom carried on drinking and got even drunker. The bride refused to marry him, her sons ended up beating the groom up &amp; the police got involved. 
The cake was used for the wedding party that evening by the bride celebrating her new found freedom...!!"

That post where a woman said she would literally put her hand in a toilet and catch her poops and let them gently roll to the bottom of the toilet to avoid making a *slpoosh* noise.

"Not my wedding, but this was a real bossy bride. During the rehearsal dinner the bride got each of her bridesmaids up on stage one by one and had the hairdresser give them all matching bobs.

Honestly the tension and awkwardness as she announced this surprise ""fun matching hair initiave"" was real. It was weird seeing grown women getting up on the stage and receiving the chop one by one. There were definitely some tears as the bride provided live commentary and urged the hairdresser to go shorter on a two of them. 

One bridesmaid left early and the bride called her up on stage during the reception to ""make up for what she missed out on"". Again it was so weird and people were clapping and laughing, but it wasn't normal. That poor woman clearly didn't want to but was peer pressured to come on stage. That was a mistake as she left with the shortest bob of all of them.

I found out later there were some unresolved issues in that group of friends and it pretty much fell apart after the wedding. 

Bride and groom are happily ever married though. "
"My mom really just let me be myself. She didn't criticize or pick apart my appearance, and she trusted me enough to let me do most things I wanted to do (within reason, of course). I find that most of my friends who hated their moms either had ridiculously strict parents, or parents who didn't build up their confidence. I totally get that parents don't want you to make the same mistakes that they did, but IMO if you parent well and help your child make better decisions, they're more likely to do so. But I think you also have to accept that at a certain point, you can be the best parent in the world and your kid can still make poor choices, because that's really just life. "
"As a female living in India I can say yes it is. People here refuse to believe it. I need to step out of my house everyday and I am exposed to all sorts of perverts and assholes. Its not just about guys looking at you like they are going to eat you but every sleazy and sneaky thing you can imagine.

One of the most frequent things done here is victim blaming. Its common to hear the politicians or the abuser to say that the girl ""enticed"" abuser. Everyday I go out I make sure I am covered (jeans, top and sneakers) but I am still subjected to some form of unwanted and inappropriate gesture or action. Using public transport is a nightmare because if you get an aisle seat then some guy or the other will try to grind or rub against your shoulder. 

As a country which worships so many goddesses we don't know how to respect our women. I hope this changes or at least I can get out of this shit hole.

Your body creates discharge! It's normal! I thought I had a yeast infection for years. My mother never explained that to me and was furious with me when she saw the discharge when doing laundry. I didn't know what I did wrong ðŸ˜­
"Being in control of/domineering over their husbands. Like bragging or joking about how she gets to decide everything and the guy is basically just strung along for the ride and bragging about how he pays for everything. It is the single most annoying thing ever, I can't even stand to be around people like that

This attitude seems so common in married women that I'm almost worried it's some sort of venereal disease that I'm likely to catch as soon as a ring is placed on my finger"
"Women are emotional whereas men are logical. 

Interestingly, I've never seen a woman put her fist through a wall in anger, set a car on fire because her favorite soccer team lost, or shoot up a shopping mall because she can't get laid, yet we are somehow the more emotional sex."
"My cousin and his very sweet now wife got married two years ago.

 Hands down the biggest shitshow of a wedding that I have ever seen. First off,  they got really unlucky with the weather, and what was supposed to be  nice cool fall weather ended up being a heatwave with a dust storm.

 In their culture, on the day of the wedding, you started the groom's house, ate a bunch of sweets, took pictures and then headed to the bride's house to collect her and then go to the church. No one had planned for real food, so the only thing that we had to eat from noon until the wedding at 8 p.m. was super sweet sugary stuff. The air conditioning was not working and we started to feel ill from the heat and sugar. We are all in formal wedding attire. 

Things really start getting sloppy by the time we went to retrieve the bride, whose home also didn't have air conditioning. People were sweating so much, and one of my aunts went to hug an uncle of mine and left the outline of her makeup on his suit, basically stamping his suit with her entire face. From there we had to drive an hour and a half to the wedding venue, and on the way, another uncle  gets into a car accident because the traffic was so bad. 

Okay, so we finally get to the church. It is steaming outside, 100 degrees full humidity. The first very obvious problem was that they had been planning for an outdoor wedding and many of the dishes that they were going to have for their buffet dinner were mayonnaise and meat-based and sitting outside for after the ceremony.

The second very obvious problem is at the church they chose was a really really old church, like eight hundred years old and it didn't have any bathrooms in it. So I asked about the bathroom situation and there were only two bathrooms, and they were across the road, up some stairs, down a hallway....for  wedding of over 100 people, including elderly people with walkers and canes. 

So all that aside, we get in to the church and it's a  beautiful church, bride looks gorgeous, and the  ceremony gets underway. In the middle of the ceremony we notice the bride start to sway, and the guests start to murmur....she faints, wakes up, and then vomits on her wedding dress. 

She's horrified, humiliated, and then starts crying in the middle of the ceremony. During this super hot day, she didn't have enough to drink and she barely had enough to eat, so when everything calmed down her body caught up with her. The priest asked her if she needs to stop, but she waves him onward determined to finish the wedding. The priest says something really nice about how marriage is not about these random happy moments like a wedding, but about the challenges that you go through as a couple and how you thrive from them. 

Okay, ceremony over, she makes it through and then we head outside to the heat and the possibly rotting and poisonous food and lack of bathrooms. I managed to avoid most of the mayonnaise based foods, but my brother and sister did not.... they would suffer greatly in the aftermath. 
 
Most guests end up staying for half an hour or so, but it was so unbearably hot that many people start leaving early on in the reception.

The last major thing rounding out this disaster was when my grandfather, on a walker, told my mom that he desperately needed to get to the bathroom. As they were crossing the street to get to said bathroom, my grandfather said he couldn't hold it anymore and whipped out his penis to try to pee on the street. My mother was horrified, and told him that he couldn't do that, so he sullenly looked at her, put his penis back, and pissed his pants in anger and frustration."
"A guy approached me and asked me out on a date in the grocery store. Said he noticed me walk in and spent 5 aisles working up the courage to ask. He was adorable and nervous and it made me blush so hard, but I had just started dating my current SO so I politely declined. He was sweet about being turned down too. "
"One time in high school, when I was going through a rough time due to one of my parents being critically ill and in the hospital, my friends walked with me to the parking lot, and I saw my car COVERED in paper hearts. Each of the hearts had something written on it that they liked about me. I burst out crying. It was something out of one of those high school movies or TV shows. 

I grew apart from/ fell out with that group of friends in college due to some personality differences and petty drama. I'm not in touch with any of them anymore, save for liking a few of their photos on Facebook. But I will always remember that gesture as one of the most special things anyone has done for me."
"On approaching women:

"Oh boy. At my cousins wedding some kid knocked over this 4 tier cake, which wouldn't of been so bad if it didn't land on the bride. The poor girl was devastated. Bawling her eyes out screaming at her mom and then my cousin told her that he was sick of her crying over stupid shit all the time and they decided to get an annulment. Everyone went home after that. "
"It was raining. I stopped to tie my shoe, and noticed I wasn't getting rained on. I looked up and some random lady was standing over me with her umbrella keeping me dry while I tied my shoe. "
"He also did the super arrogant thing that incel types do, which is assume that no man in a relationship with a woman is happy.  He talked about how men want to bond with women but there's ""no one there"" and they're unable to form such a bond.  

Like, tons of men in heterosexual relationships have a great bond with their SOs.  You only think otherwise if you're living in an echo chamber of bad sitcoms and shitty groups online."
"That's so cruel. Not only cutting somebody's hair against their will, but doing it in front of a large crowd. Was the hairdresser okay with doing that? I mean I guess she was, lol. "
"I found parking downtown, on a weekday, in front of the building I had an appointment at.  That shit doesn't happen in real life!"
"My co-worker was supposed to get married about two months after me. I was so excited for her because she was a single mom in her 50s and it really sounded like she had met a guy who would treat her right (her ex, by her description, was abusive). She would complain about some of the arguments that her and her fiance had before the wedding, and while my wedding was super easy to plan, I chalked it up to weddings being stressful for some people and would tell her not to worry about the small things.

Well, a month before the wedding, she found out her fiance never officially divorced his ex he broke up with 15 years prior. She had no idea, but even if she didn't, they had been planning their wedding for three years and he had plenty of time to track his ex down and get the papers signed. He just made zero effort to do so. She told me they would just ""fake"" the wedding because she had already spent thousands on the wedding, and her fiance planned to officially get everything settled so they could go to a courthouse at a later date. Red flags already went up in my head, but I knew she had already gotten to the final touches on this and had family traveling from out of town, so I got why she didn't want to cancel the party.

Then two days before the wedding, she came home and dude's stuff was all packed and gone. No notice, and she's never heard from him since. She ended up throwing the party anyways and celebrating a ""bullet dodged"", but I know she's still hurting. The worst part is that he didn't just do this to her, but also her kids who he had bonded with for 8 years, and who he was going to be a step-dad to."

"I went to my coworker's housewarming party for her new home. I knocked on the door and was invited in, placed my gift on the gift table, and proceeded to make small talk and ask the gentleman who let me in how he knew my coworker and her husband.

"The position of your cervix changes depending on where you are in your cycle, and that's why sometimes it can get hit during sex when other times it doesn't. Also, you can tell when you're ovulating depending on the consistency of your discharge.

"probably how ""most/all"" 18 year old girls are attracted to the ""maturity and stability"" of a 38 year old.  Um no.  It does happen but literally all statistics show women like men around their age, and having been that 18 year old girl who used sleazy older guys for free drinks I find it funny how many guys delude themselves on this one.

Inevitably they'll be like ""Yeah well tell that to my 19 year old gf"" and it's like dude, people on My 600 Pound Life are married, your personal anecdotes mean nothing bye"
"Any kind of misunderstanding that could easily be solved if they just communicated.

"Someone posed the question 'in what ways are you being authentic to yourself?' a couple weeks ago and it didn't get many responses and the few that it did get were just use less social media, but I really liked the question and I've been thinking about it a lot.

"I remember this.

After the 'ohmygodwhy?!' reactions she explained it was because when she was young, her father used to stand outside the bathroom door screaming abuse and shaming her for pooping. :("
"Michael Puett, who teaches a very popular class on Chinese Philosophy at Harvard, really tries to fight against this question.

There are many selves or roles we play in life. And those selves will change over time as well, introducing even more dynamism into the system.

Finding your ""one true self"" is a concept that instead of bringing freedom, locks us into a struggle of searching instead of growing, remaining instead of becoming. 

This idea of a one true self or a core being is heavily based on Calvinism and Puritanism. Look into Max Weber or Frances Fitzgerald for more on this. 

There is a line in ""Gravity's Rainbow"" this reminds me about: *'If they can get you asking the wrong questions, they don't have to worry about answers.'* 

Hope I've provided a different perspective. In fairness, the system I outline could become just as restrictive and suffocating as the one I'm railing against. Best suggestion I can make is to learn all the ways, and the find the balance you deem appropriate."

"Anything having to do with how easy women have it in dating (and life in general).

According to a huge swathe of the dudes on this site, as long as a woman isn't fat and/or brutally ugly, she can expect to constantly be the center of male attention. That has never been my experience, but of course whenever a woman contradicts this truism the response is that she must be fat and/or brutally ugly."
"This is gonna get buried, but a few months ago women were talking about birthing methods, whether to go epidural or no epidural, etc., and how catty or high-and-mighty some women get when talking about their choice in birth methods. Someone said ""there is no medal for suffering"" in response to some women casting judgment against other women for choosing not to endure pain during childbirth. ""There is no medal for suffering"" has stuck with me pretty hard. I think about it almost every day, about one thing or another, and have even spoken it out loud in response to similar situations. 

edit: while it totally does apply re: childbirth, I use it as a philosophy in general--the ""hard"" way isn't necessarily better or worth more merit than the ""easy"" way, and people who try to be martyrs or act like they are high and mighty for suffering aren't really people I want to spend my time with.

"THIS right here! I remember being about 14 and reading some women's magazine and reading an article about discharge could be a sign of bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. Well, I had discharge in my panties every single day! I *must* have one of these conditions! So being too shy to really talk about it, I tore the article out and handed it to my mom. She said ""What's this for?"" I said ""I think I might have something, I have discharge in my underwear like in that article. Can you help me make an appointment?"" She just said okay, and then never made the appointment. In hindsight, it's probably because she knew that I was fine if all I was having was discharge, so she just didn't follow up. But seriously mom, you could have said ""Honey, that's normal, and unless you're having pain or strange smells, you're perfectly fine and normal."" Nope, let's just ignore your pubescent daughter and her confusion about her own body..."

"A friend of mine from high school became pen pals with several guys in prison immediately after graduation and started on a tear of dating said prisoners, including one guy who had been in prison for sexually assaulting a small child.

One of the guys she'd been corresponding with got out, and they started dating in person, and she quickly became pregnant. Despite the fact that this person already had four children with three different ex-wives (He was 30, and my friend was 22 at this point), she decided to marry him.

At the wedding and reception took place at a local spot with ""Country Tavern"" in the name. The bride was visibly pregnant in a brown and pink polka dot dress, and the groom wore jeans. I should say at this point - my friend was *not* a country girl, came from a family that was very upper-middle class and verging on high society, parents very influential business owners in the community, etc. So it was all pretty shocking.

The bride and groom moved in together in a house her dad owned, and the baby came along 3 months later. The couple got divorced 5 months after that. "

There was that ""Utopia"" show that was kind of similar, but they voted people in and out and had all these mini-competitions, but I'd want a show that's more about the struggle of rebuilding as opposed to a show that's about people competing to stay.  My show wouldn't be a competition - more of a social experiment.  I think the drama would produce itself in time."
"Exactly. We can have sex with men who will almost certainly not get us off and who won't give a shit if they get us off.

"Honestly, the first two cuts during the rehearsal dinner she seemed neutral on it. Later when the bride started getting involved (with a little alcohol in her system) the hairdresser got a lot more into it. One of the bridesmaids had just sat down and she wrapped a hair cape around her and immediately grabbed a hand full of hair, chopped it and theatrically let it rain down onto the bridesmaid's lap who just sat there with her mouth wide open in shock.

During the actual reception she only cut the one bridesmaid's hair that got away during the rehearsal dinner. It was almost like a show where the hairdresser kept asking ""good or should we go shorter?"" To which the bride yelled ""Shorter!!"" every time. She also paused a few times for photo opportunities and posing next to her 'client' while holding out the scissors. 

Thinking back of it just makes me feel awkward really. 

"
"I was a bridesmaid in a DIY wedding where almost nothing was done until the day before. To make an insanely long story semi-shorter:

-there was little to no communication from the bride leading up to the wedding. We had to reach out to find out where she wanted us to stay, when she wanted us to arrive, etc. 
-she threw a fit via text the night before the rehearsal because none of us had done anything to help them prepare (note: she never asked for our help)
-the bridal party painted all the signs (one of which she made us repaint)
-I helped assemble all the bouquets, which we were then told to redo
-the bride, MOH, and groom drove out to Home Depot at 8 pm the night before the wedding to get pallet boards to make a dance floor
-they then wanted to stain the boards until we convinced them otherwise 
-the bride and her MOH sat on the roof and drank wine while several bridesmaids and groomsmen painted the dance floor...in their rehearsal dinner clothes
-the bride was actually my husband's best friend from college and was his best ""man"". Both she and her fiancÃ© ""forgot"" to ask him to be in the wedding. 
-morning of the wedding guests are arriving and the dance floor is not assembled. Guests were literally taking turns nailing the boards together. With the tools my FIL just happened to have in his truck because of his job. 
-the bride was over half an hour late for the wedding
-did I mention this was an outdoor seaside wedding in Maine in May? The day of the rehearsal was 80 and sunny. The day of the wedding was in the 50s and a downpour
-no one tested the sound system until the first dance, so it didn't work properly. After dancing to the 3+ min song with poor quality...they fixed the system and did it again 
-oh, they also waited over half an hour after dinner had finished to start the dancing because the bride, groom, moh, and groomsmen went to play in the rain. Half the guests left before dancing or toasts started
-one of the bridesmaids was severely allergic to the flowers in the bouquets

And my personal favorite:
-after the rehearsal dinner there was a ton of food left over. One of the groom's brothers suggested they donate it to a food shelter. But his mother was adamant they keep it because she spent too much money on it for it to go to the homeless. 

But, hey, their vows were beautiful and they're still happily married, and the bride and I haven't talked since the day of her wedding, so...cheers!

Tl;dr: DIY means leave everything to the last minute, then make your bridal party do it!

EDIT: changed ""reception"" to ""rehearsal"" multiple times..."

My sister was a complete hellion, so it wasn't terribly difficult to look like an angel in comparison.

I will say this. I adored my mother. 

For my 16th birthday she took me around to different businesses to fill out applications for work because, for my state, I was now finally able to legally work. No party, no cake,  just applying and interviewing for jobs. And I didn't mind. Really. I knew we needed the money.

Every paycheck I received was direct deposited into her checking account. I never saw a dime of the money I earned. And I didn't care, because I was happy to help her and the family. It was nice to contribute.

This continued for years. And I didn't care. Honestly. If I needed something, I asked her... and if it was in the budget, she would get it for me. For example, I asked for a bicycle so I could bike to school/work instead of walk... and she went and let me pick out a bike.

Now, when I was 19 years old, had graduated high school, found better jobs, and was still giving her all of my money, she found out that I was gay.... and she gave me 24 hours to get out of the house and never spoke to me again.

This fucked me up for a long, long time. I was devastated. This is how I learned that love is conditional.

Just love your kid unconditionally, because they will love you unconditionally and unquestionably, by default... unless you show them otherwise. "

She's a nurse, and she was at a wedding where a girl was falling down drunk in the bathroom. Not only did this girl puke, but she pooped herself. Then her sister came in, also drunk, and they fought and somehow slipped in the crap and one got knocked out. My SIL called an ambulance. "
"There was a response on a thread about getting over feeling like you don't measure up to your partner's exes. The poster talked about how no matter how much smarter, prettier, funnier you think she is... that wasn't enough to keep them together. I'm pretty sure I stayed up at night just thinking about that and how true that is. I've never been in a relationship, but I imagine that thought may be helpful in the future.

"Story time! A couple of years ago while on a bus I was getting these creepy vibes from a guy. He was acting really weird, constantly looking around with a shifty look in his eyes. I saw him sit infront of him then suddenly stand up and move to where I was sitting. A few moments later I felt something like skin brush against my upper arm. It was his dick. In broad daylight he felt it was okay to pull out his dick and rub it against my shoulder. So I started cussing him out and basically yelled my head off. Thanks to the people around me I got hold of him and got that asshole arrested. 

While in the police station he defended himself by saying that he must have forgotten to zip his fly after he got off his shift as a waiter. The Indian Police can be pretty chill when it comes to stuff like this. But fortunately my family knows a couple of people on the force so they arrested him, got my statement and  kicked his ass. 

As a victim of childhood sexual abuse I had promised myself that if I ever found myself in such a situation I will stand up against the abuser. And that's what I did :) so I was pretty proud of myself. But some of my ""friends"" and extended family thought I should have just kept my mouth shut and got a different seat for myself. But fuck them :)

"As I've mentioned on here a couple times, I was at a wedding once where the groom slept with a bridesmaid at the reception. So that was the worst I've seen.  
  
I've also attended a wedding where the pastor was so drunk he forgot the couple's names and that they were going to say their own vows, and fell back on his standard sermon that he slurred his way through.  They ended up doing their vows at the reception later."

Women in India have no freedom to wear whatever they like, they cant step out of the house after dark and feel completely safe. I wish media would highlight the issue of eve teasing, sexual assaults a lot more than they do. I feel politicians and a lot of Indians are still in denial and think media is showing them in bad light and that we are a very ""cultured"" lot. since I have personally experienced harassment on public transport and in the streets on several occasions, I wish it was just a case of selective media.

Well come the wedding day my cousin wore a small, tight homemade ""wedding dress"" to the reception and had people pay to dirty dance with her. Well, lo and behold he wasn't fond of this idea. He started yelling, calling her a slut. She said it was her day and she could do whatever she wanted. In the end he threw a beer in her face and ran out.

I was **furious**, but I didn't yell, I just kept as calm as I could and willed myself not to cry as I told him, ""Look, my husband didn't bust his knee. He has pancreatic cancer, and he needs his medicine. I don't care who you have to fucking call, but I'm not leaving without those pills.""  He turned ashen and I turned around and took my daughter to the toy aisle. It was seriously less than 2 minutes before he called me back, sheepishly apologized and gave me the meds. Probably long enough for him to Google the name of the prescribing physician. I always think of that situation as a cliche scene in our ""cancer movie."""

"I was at the grocery store with my toddler sons, and there's shopping carts that look like cars/trucks that have two seats and two steering wheels.

He chose the pink hippie car so I loaded up both kids into the car cart and off we went to do our shopping.

"I hate that mentality too and I've noticed that men sometimes have the social training to go along with it. For example, my husband might ask me something like ""Honey, can I go golfing with my friends on Saturday?"" As if I have to give him permission...? My response is usually ""You're an adult... don't ask me permission, do what you want. If what you're really asking me is if we have plans that day, or if I was hoping to spend that time with you and would be sad if we missed out, then actually ask that."" We have had many interactions like that before. Another example is when talking to his friends - if he doesn't want to do something with them, instead of just telling them no, he will say that I won't let him. I hate that shit. Don't make me look like a controlling wife who mothers you so you can avoid confrontation.

"In one thread about one partners taking the other's last name in a marriage, I commented that since marriage is a traditional institution I wanted my wife to take my last name (to which she heartily agreed, no problem there) and everybody ganged up on me and said I might as well piss on her in the morning so that everybody would know she was mine when she left the house.

"""You're beautiful.""

I know some people hate this, but it was a really sweet moment IMO. I was walking on a busy sidewalk in broad daylight in one direction. He was walking in the other direction. As we got closer, our eyes met and I smiled because that's what I do when that accidentally happens, and when he passed me he returned the smile and said, ""*Mademoiselle, vous Ãªtes magnifique.*""

My smile grew bigger and I thanked him, and he went on his way and I went on mine. I never saw him again and wouldn't recognize him if I saw him in the street tomorrow, but I kept that smile for several minutes. It wasn't an aggression or a catcall, it was a genuine compliment with zero expectation behind it. He had nothing to gain from it except putting a smile on a stranger's face. "

"People who have close friendships to the point where they're basically family.

I mean, I've got a cool few friends but I've never had a ""bff"" that I was extremely close with. I get jealous when I see people who are in their 20s and still have sleep overs and get wine drunk with their bff that they've had since they were 8. "
"I already commented but just thought of something else (and men do this too, actually): being an introvert.

I'm an introvert. It's not a mental disorder. It's not a reason to be rude nor is it synonymous with social anxiety. I have lots of friends and spend most nights of the week out doing things; I'm not a recluse.

Being introverted does not make you more sophisticated than extroverts. You're not more complex because you ""can't people today."" You're not more worldly or evolved because you need six hours of alone time and you don't like small talk. No one actually likes small talk, but being able to navigate social situations and play the ""game"" as it were is an important skill that even we introverts can master when we have to."

I got a message from him saying that he couldn't go to the movie anymore and that he didn't think the relationship was going to work out (his reasons were honestly good reasons like working three jobs and going to school full-time simultaneously). I was crushed. 
I gave him the time old, ""I understand. Thank you for being honest with me,"" and ended up walking home in the dark alone, crying in freezing sleet rain without a decent coat or boots (because he was going to pick me up). When I got home I was soaked completely and my hair was frozen in chunks. 


It was the first time I'd honestly ever been rejected. It was quite dramatic. Luckily it was a Friday and I could just lock myself in my room and binge on TV shows and video games. When I emerged, I was over it."

"Last Wednesday, I was biking home from work and stopped at an intersection at the red light. About 1/2 a mile of my bike route doesn't have a bike lane, and the intersection is in that part. So I'm on a bike in an intersection full of cars. 


I was stopped, intending to continue straight. Stopped at the light of the cross-street (to my left) was a pickup truck waiting for their green left turn arrow. I biked up and stopped, the driver of the pickup yelled ""Hey biker!"" I looked over, like, you know, a person does, and he whistled and said something about ""Can you ride me?"" I looked away but he kept yelling. It was about 30 seconds until my light changed, he yelled and whistled the whole time, repeatedly making ""ride me,"" jokes and telling me to flash him. I had to stand up on my bike to get the momentum to get started, and he honked, whistled, and yelled about my ass. 


I kept going, about a minute or two down the road, he caught up with me and started honking. I moved over as far as I could, hit a bump, and had to brake and put my legs down to not fall. He then called me fatass and gunned it out of there. Shockingly, his truck was huge and his exhaust and muffler sucked. I only saw the last digit of his plate :/ 


Not only was he a big-looking man catcalling me (a petite woman), but he was in a truck and I was on a bike. He nearly ran me off the road. I've never felt so vulnerable. "

"You might just have anxious attachment. Meaning you are predisposed to worry about the status of your partner and your relationship. It's pretty normal and does not indicate a mental illness or abuse or anything like that.  Despite what a lot of pop psych will tell you.

I'm like that. My boyfriend knows and checks in more with me than he'd do otherwise. I try to watch for my insecurity and nip in the bud with a quick check in with him.

I would not listen to people that say there's something seriously wrong or something seriously wrong with you. I spent so long thinking there was something deeply wrong and that I didn't trust enough or something. It wasn't productive. People make way too many judgments about what anxiety MUST mean. Mostly, if someone is more anxious than others its simply because they are more prone for biological reasons. 

There's nothing majorly wrong. The wrongness comes in how you handle it. You gotta own it and talk to your partner about it. Just be like ""hey I get anxiety in relationships. It really helps if we can do check-ins about it and I might need you to help me calm down from time to time. I'm working on it from my end, but it'll probably always be a natural disposition of mine. So I can get better with it but I'll probably never be super chill about it.""

Then if they can't deal with that, then you just gotta move on, confident that you'll find someone who can deal with it. Just don't pretend you're super chill and then hit them with severe relationship anxiety two weeks in. That's when things go bad. "

"I wanted a new bed but didn't want to get IKEA and couldn't afford anything high end [so I built one](https://imgur.com/a/l4eic). 

Like what? I turned a pile of lumber into a piece of functional furniture? Heck yeah! I found a blueprint online and Dad helped tweak a few structural things but for the most part that's all me. I felt like I could conquer the world when I set it up in my room. Haha!

Edit: I created an [Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/8vVu0) with some of the pictures I took during the process. I used the plans for Ana White's [Farmhouse bed](http://www.ana-white.com/2010/03/farmhouse-bed-calif-king) and made the queen sized version. 

Some things we changed that aren't noted in the imgur album:

In the plans the side rails are glued and screwed into the inside edge of the posts. I made this around my 27th birthday and knew I didn't want it to be a permanent fixture in my parents' home. We opted out of the glue and recessed the side rails into the posts for extra / proper weight support. This did alter the overall width of the bed but since the mattress fits within the rails it didn't change the needed 60"" width of a queen mattress. 

Since the side rails were now recessed into the wood and didn't need to be hidden by the footboard we were able to lower the height of everything. I'm only 5' and when you factor in the high of a mattress and box spring things add up. Even with lowering the side rails and ordering a custom box spring height, the top of my mattress still sits at around 28"" so I have to climb into bed. 

I used 2x4s as slats to for the mattress and box spring to sit on and they're spaced ~4"" apart. I then cut and stapled pieces of a 1x2"" to sit between the slats to prevent them from shifting around. This is probably more support than needed but I'd rather be safe than sorry, and it also meant I didn't need a vertical support beam in the centre of the frame. 

In the plans the side rails and decorative pieces on the head &amp; footboard are 2"" thick pieces of wood. This almost doubled the price of each piece and I found it added a bit of unnecessary bulk so I got 1"" pieces instead. In the end I didn't end up using the 1x6 pieces on the head and footboards because I preferred how it looked without. 

I started this labour day weekend 2015 and finished just after Halloween. I did what I could alone on my holidays that week, and after work and on weekends after that. I wouldn't have been able to do this without my dad because I've never done anything like it before. I was, for the most part, ""project lead"" but he definitely guided me through the process!"
"If it's slippery like egg whites and shows up about 2 weeks before your period (generally speaking), yup, it's there to help the sperm swim up inside.  A few days later it changes to thick and opaque to keep crud out.    

Bonus: paying attention to the mucus is a much better way to predict your period than a straight calendar is.  Stress throws off ovulation, so if the goo tells you ""huh, ovulated a week late this month"" then you can *expect* a ""late"" period.  That saved me so much grief in college.  "
"Oh, another great one from an acquaintance:

Here in Brazil most people don't really speak English. Therefore most of the songs they like from foreign groups are liked for the melody only and people hardly ever care to check the lyrics for a translation.

And that's how a groom entered his wedding to the sound of ""And I still haven't found what I'm looking for"" by U2"
That women talk more than men. If anything studies have shown it's the contrary.
"And this is exactly the kind of self reflection and discussion that this question provokes which is why I couldn't stop thinking about it.

"Background: Mexican wedding - I wasn't allowed a canadian one because (and I quote) ""Im not paying for all of your friends to come eat, drink and celebrate."" All my friends were students and poor, all of his friends work in the oil fields and are wealthier so he thought it was a good way to have the wedding with ALL his friends there and none of mine. Joke was on him, 5 of my friends saved up and came, not a single one of his friends did. We had 14 other people attend only 3 people from his side came. The other 11 people were mind including friends and family who came from as far away as New Zealand. 

I could go through a huge list that was the disaster of my life 3 months building up to the wedding but lets just talk about my personal highlight.

My brand new drunk husband getting in my face pointing a finger at me and saying ""you're a LIAR, you did it on purpose"" over and over with increasing volume in front of my family. 

This was because his brother had proposed we all go to resort nightclub after the reception and I had forgotten because I was a. drunk and b. with my family who I hadn't seen in 5 years. 

His brother had been at the club by himself for 40 minutes and hadn't bothered to come back and see if we were still hanging out at the cabana we had been in for 2 hours. 

So I spent the next 2 hours of my wedding night being forced to apologize to his brother for being a ""LIAR"". I ended up finishing up my wedding night puking because the club was hot and I was dehydrated but I wasn't allowed to leave until they closed to placate my new husband and his idiot brother.

This one is super sad. :(

"Yeeeppppp. Betrayed by her partner and best friend on her wedding day, though I heard later that they had been having an affair for awhile (who knows if that's true or not).  
  
This was years ago and I can report that the same woman is now happily married to a man who treats her like gold, so that's something, but doesn't really change what happened. "
I just want to say that was a fantastic read.
"Anger is a ""permitted"" male emotion, but one that is destructive, so it needs to be suppressed. We're left with stoicism and anger as permitted ways to deal with things. That's a generalization of course. Anger is the go-to when stoicism fails. I agree that ""Women are emotional whereas men are logical."" is a false stereotype, but what is interesting is what is encouraged by media, parents and peers. "
What the fuck? I'll never understand someone shaming another person for a biological process that pretty much *everyone* on the planet does. :|

"I play my ""get pumped"" playlist, take a really long, nice shower, shave and lotion up, put on my favourite dress or jeans-and-top combo, and do my makeup real nice. Putting effort into my appearance usually makes me feel fierce and unstoppable."
"People who's parents paid their way through college. Even people who's parents put a lot of time and effort into getting scholarships, grants, etc. I had no help. I had no idea what to do. The high school counselor was of no assistance at all. I wish I had pushed through the confusion and just asked one of my favorite teachers or found someone who could help. 

Heck, I'm even jealous of people who could stay at home in a comfortable environment while they went to school. I moved out when I was 18 because my friend convinced me it was a good idea (it was not). I should have just stayed home even though it meant little space or privacy and sucked it up for a few more years. I was able do one semester full time while living with my parents and working part time. I was broke from paying my tuition and the few bills I had but I got good grades. When I had to work full time and pay rent it slowed down until one semester I put it off and never ended up going back.

It is VERY different than bragging about having so many children and talking about how women who aren't mothers are somehow without and missing out on life. "
"Someone I know wanted to get married at the church she grew up going to as it was also close to the reception and is a pretty church. 

Newer pastor decided to talk about how marriage is ONLY a man and a woman...when half the the bride's friends are gays and dragqueens and the groom's sister is lesbian. Then he also brought up political shit I think to impress guests that are in government in the front row but it just annoyed everyone like WTF does that have to do with marriage? When he was blessing them he blasted the bride in the face with holy water than a sprinkle.

It was the most awkward ceremony ever. Reception was fantastic though!  "

"* The importance of peeing after sex and wiping properly

* That your vagina won't become looser the more sex you have, or the more partners you have

* Basic anatomy (I am floored by the number of grown-ass women out there who don't realize that the urethra and the vagina are separate orifices)

* The hymen =/= a ""freshness seal""

* Labia come in all different shapes, colors, and sizes...and none of them are ""gross"". Nor does their length have anything to do with how many partners one has or how much sex one has.

"- Your breasts may get big and/or lumpy during different parts of your cycle. This is normal and you don't have breast cancer.  

- Kegels are not actually effective for everyone. If you have a tight pelvic floor, focus more on relaxing and releasing the muscles first, not on contracting them. This is a major problem for many women I work with; they're grippers and they suck in their bellies/contract their pelvic floor muscles all day (which can increase anxiety BIGTIME). I tell them they need more baggy shirts and belly breaths.

- Holding in #1 (constantly) can lead to bladder problems. Holding in #2 (too frequently) can cause you health problems because the longer you hold the stool in your colon, the more water is absorbed and the harder it becomes, which could potentially cause colon damage due to the effort and strain of expelling it later on. I did both of these excessively as a child. :(

- Drink a large amount of water after a night of drinking. Like at least a liter. Do not go to sleep until you do. You'll thank me in the morning.

- Your body odor will change with different foods, climate, stress and other lifestyle factors. This is normal. Pay attention to all the ways your body changes when you add or subtract a habit, to see what works for you.

- Advocate for yourself. Nobody knows your body like you do. Tune in to it, pay attention to it and treat it well. It's the only one you're gonna have and trust me when I say nobody will understand it and it's experiences more fully than you. If you need treatment, fight for it. Do not allow anyone to silence you.

"That any guy would have sex with an average woman (or any woman, as some claim).  This is clearly not true.  If it were men would never initiate breakups in casual relationships, reject women who came on to them, and that dating website thing where guys want to chat but they don't want to meet wouldn't ever happen.  Not to mention that there are women all over the relationship/sex subreddits who are being regularly rejected by their SO's.  Guys turn down sex with all kinds of women all the time.   "
"That not putting up with hate speech is somehow worse than actually spewing it in the first place.

"Is your hair chemically treated/colored/bleached? Then you gotta get a color safe sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. Color safe shampoos and conditioners have lower pHs so that your color stays longer and washes out much slower. 

Dry hair? Once or twice a week use an ultra moisturizing masque. When you get out of the shower, towel dry your hair and put in your favorite oil (argan, almond, coconut, etc), or a leave in conditioner.

Do you wash your hair everyday? Well, stop that. You're getting rid of your natural oils that keep your hair soft and moisturized.

Got split ends? Cut them off early or the split will travel up the hair shaft.

Do you heat style your hair? Use a heat protectant!

Consider your diet, too. Take a multivitamin and up your water intake, a healthy scalp helps healthy hair.

You reeeeeeallllyy fucked up your hair? Get a repair masque and slather it on. Do not wash it off! Braid your hair and go to bed. In the morning you can rinse the excess off, and your hair will be in better condition, albeit not better than before you fucked it up.

You suuuuper fucked up your hair with bleach but you want to color it to cover up your fuck up? Do a protein treatment first - got to spackle a wall before you can paint it.

Chlorinated hair from the pool or well water? Use a clarifying shampoo!

Also look at your hairbrush!! Get a bors hair one to distribute the oil in your hair evenly.

"Or that you can't enjoy lipstick AND rock climbing? People can have diverse hobbies and interests. They don't have to fit neatly into little stereotypes.

"I find that a lot of people on reddit tend to think they are all knowing of the motivations of women based on something they've only ever heard from men. A few examples:

* I see a lot of the ""Women are nice to their friends but they don't mean it, men are mean to their friends but don't mean it,"" and, okay, way to perpetuate a lot of really negative stereotypes, but also this is just not true. Men are equally capable of being fake and two-faced, and IME the majority of women have genuine relationships with their friends (as do men).
* When the subject of height comes up, two things are always guaranteed: a mention of how women are supposedly only attracted to men over 6', and then someone asking why and the inevitable ""because it makes them feel small and protected etc."" comment... What? The first statement is just false, considering the percentage of the (US) male population over 6' compared the male population who have been/are in relationships with women. Also, while by some technicality it may be the majority (as in, over half but still not a terribly significant figure) that prefer tall men, most girls don't have a rigid height preference and those who they cite as ""refusing"" anyone under 6'1"" are few and far between. The second is... weird. I've never known any woman who feels that way, and I'm not saying they don't exist, but that definitely sounds like a dude just lashing out against someone who wasn't interested and making up excuses to justify himself (like the ""whatever lol didn't wanna date u anway"" DM, but in real life). "
"A tomboy that shows a man how to shoot a gun/drive a stick/another 'masculine' thing and then when he's shocked she'll say ""my dad wanted a boy"" or ""I was the only girl of three boys"" and then she'll get progressively girlier throughout the film and he'll fall in love with her cause she's so feminine and then in the end she has a fight in heels. "
"&gt; As a woman, I often feel like a small, bumbly, emotionally charged little creature.  Estrogen is a funny thing: No matter what happens, I will journey through life, always confused by my own complexity, always feeling the need to protect myself, though always needing to overcompensate in that protection, always overwhelmed by how much love I have inside me, and always searching for someone or something I can pour it into.  

As a woman, I cannot relate to this on any level. I'm not confused by my emotions or motivations, and I haven't felt like a ""small, bumbly, emotionally charged little creature"" since I was about 5. 

&gt; When a man puts his hand on my arm, or pulls me into his chest, my mind just goes quiet.  I can sink into him, let go of the chaos, trust him to protect me and allow myself to put down my guard.  He can do it better than I can, he's stronger than me, and it helps me to relax.  

He can do what better than she can? Relax? Stop fidgeting? Again, can't relate. 

I respect that that's how this woman in particular feels, and I recognize that there are probably a good many women who share this feeling. I can also appreciate that way it's written; OP has a way with words that I really enjoy. All of that aside, this is one of those things that makes me feel awkward and slightly uncomfortable. When I was younger, this would have made me question my own femininity because I don't share those feelings. 

This comment will probably stick with me, but maybe for other reasons than what the first OP intended. "
"Nope. She was 32 and my cousin was 28.

Apparently, one day, she came in ""complaining"" about how this 30yr old dude likes her because she's sooooooo much more mature than other women his age (I can't even type that without rolling my eyes). She complains that he has kids, and then starts taking about how she MIGHT be ready to be a stepmom at 19yrs old. I want to puke now."
Bisexual people can't be happy in monogamous relationships.
"And you don't want to seem like an idiot. 

If you mess up on your own, like burning the crap out of a simple grilled cheese sandwich, it's oop, I guess it's blackened cheese tonight. Whereas in a relationship you feel like your failure is there for everyone to see and you feel more uncertain. Should I tell him we are just eating it anyways like I would by myself? Fend for yourself? Eat out? Try again (I don't feel like it, but I feel bad offering him burned food)? 

A healthy relationship I think involves growing into healthy boundaries/understandings of these kinds of things. Owning that mistakes/things happen, and you have boundaries or limitations. Like me making dinner involves no repeats if it's messed up. It's fend for yourself or dinner out or eat what's been made, though messed up. And I definitely had growing pains in my relationship with this one. "

"That millenials are entitled. Often applied to situations where millenials ask for things that are entirely basic and fair.

Excuse me for wanting to have the same opportunities our parents have, or hell at this point I'd even settle for a fraction of the opportunities the generations before had. How dare we be so 'entitled' to kick up a fuss when our basic rights and standard of living are being eroded?"
"That's definitely going to stick with me. It's also why I'm always so soft and careful when I'm turning down a guy. I've just heard so many stories about guys snapping when getting turned down.

Edit: It also reminds me of the episode of Master of None where it shows a typical night out for guys vs. girls. The guys walk home from the bar late at night complaining about mundane things (stepping in dog poop or something like that) while the girl goes home scared because she's getting followed by a drunk guy. It's striking though how often that kind of stuff happens to women. "

"Oh man, it's so cliche and I wish it weren't boy related but - when I told my (now) husband that I loved him the first time. I hadn't seen him in a year, after pretending that it would be too tricky to be together long distance. So when we met in a beach town, and I told him I loved him on the night of a full Blood Moon and we swam noody in the warm shallows - it legit felt like a movie. That doesn't happen for everyone and I am grateful to the universe for it. "

"A friend of mine introduced me to one of his female friends with the whole ""well, you both like anime and geeky shit, so you'll be bffs right away!""

And this girl is...nice but she's got a weird complex about femininity. She was genuinely disappointed that some of what I've read and watched is in the shoujo genre. She actually grimaced when I mentioned really loving Madoka.

So the whole evening was weird little insults about everything I do/like/wear. Wearing makeup? Ugh, she NEVER wears makeup because her time is VALUABLE, and women who wear makeup are just self loathing fools. Complimented my Ninja Gaiden tank top, but pointed out that she never wears tank tops, they're so girly and t shirts are much better, am I right guys? Love Danganronpa and my favourite character is one of the females? Ugh, typical girl, liking girl characters.

Thankfully she wasn't a typical girl, so that was a real relief I'm sure.

At first, it was sort of funny. I'd keep picking or mentioning more 'lady things' to see what made them terrible but after awhile it's just uncomfortable when someone just hates everything about you.

"I haven't had a problem finding partners who share my values and views. Like another poster said here, it's a preference, not a requirement. As long as my sexual needs are met, I likely wouldn't even question his use of porn, much less frequency. That being said, my reasons for not liking porn are largely ethical, and I infinitely prefer a partner that doesn't watch it at all. Additionally, men who are into porn generally do a really shitty job of hiding it, and their masturbatory habits become obvious in the bedroom."
"Met a guy on Tinder, had a great time talking to him. We tried to meet in person but we were both busy and couldn't make it work. Stopped talking to him after a few failed attempts.

Several months later, a friend and I made plans to hang out. She was hanging out at a friend's house. Drove there, opened the door, and realized her friend was Mr. Tinder.

We've been dating for a few months now. :)"
"It's not a strong preference so it doesn't really interfere with relationships, but I managed to find people who share my values and opinions on porn so it's pretty good. It's not about insecurity for me so much as it's about the fact that I think most porn is gross and violent."
"Our ceremony went off without a hitch, but the photographer got so drunk she couldn't even stand by the end of the night. 

She was super appolegetic about it, waived all fees, released all the photos to us in original format and etc. But none of the photos are any Good. we had a flash free wedding( as required by the church). The framed photo displayed on my in laws mantle looks like it was taken with a potato.

"My current SO and I fell for each other while I was in a fairly emotionally abusive relationship. We worked together and became very close friends but when I realized I had feelings (and didn't yet realize my situation at the time was so toxic) I stopped speaking to him. A month later at a work-sponsored booze cruise he came up and told me he missed me. I started sobbing, he gave me a choice, and I knew what had to be done. I broke up with my bf that night, packed a bag and left. 

That was a little over three years ago. I'm happier, healthier and more in love than ever.

TL;DR: my current SO and my origin story is basically identical to Jim and Pam from The Office. "
"I'm sick of the opposite. I have had way to many female friends brag about how many boyfriends or guys they've been with. Its even worse when they find out someone has never dated or has only been with one guy.

"What, like, ever?

Some parent let their kid run around a wedding without proper supervision and the kid wound up destroying (between the cake and the dress) multiple thousand dollars' worth of property the bride had probably struggled and saved to pay for.

That's not releasing stress. That's completely justified anger. I would have been screaming, too. Not at the child, but at his parents, for sure. They deserved to be screamed at."
"Yeah, I have tried to have casual sex and it's always been disappointing. I have way better sex with guys who actually give a shit about me so I just stick to having sex when I'm in a relationship.

Besides during the honeymoon phase there is excitement and I feel very special, if I didn't feel that I wouldn't be dating the guy. It is when that excitement starts to fade my insecurities start. Because I know and experienced, some people mix up excitement/lust with love and leave when that ends. Or, it is more likely my partner might seek for *new excitement*, compare me to other women, and/or take me for granted. Not necessarily of course but I have the worry."
"I'm sick of women still bragging that they're virgins or haven't had many partners. Whoop-dee-fucking-doo, girl. You're so much better than the rest of us dirty slutbags. Seriously, this is the 21st fucking century and I still see women rub this in other women's faces. "

The challenges would all focus on real life challenges facing society and the world at large that they would have to brainstorm solutions to, guided by and mentored by real world movers and shakers.

"Guy or girl pretends to be wealthy and successful to get the other person to fall in love it them.  The other person does then find out the success and money was a lie, but it's ok because they are in love now.

Then that those gold digger will forget about their preference because they have seen the error of their ways in wanting someone successful or don't want to be seen as shallow.  Then that the relationship built on such a unnecessary lie will be perfectly fine in the future because who cares about building trust."
"Don't rush into things because other people are. I found 24 is when a lot of friends started getting married and having kids. I was single and thought it was never going to happen for me. Now I look back and think I was so young! I was still becoming me. I'm just married now at 30 and I'm so happy I had my 20s to have fun with my girlfriends. I loved living with them and having fun. Generally having my 20s to do what I wanted when I wanted. I wish I'd stopped and took time to realise how great my life was at the time. (It's still great now just different great)

"-yes


-better than expected (if you got a good pro)


So here's what happened: I was gifted some money from my grandma.  I got regular headshots done (like for LinkedIn and just... .so I remember what I look like when I'm old. And I decided to get sexy ones done too because it felt SOO out of my comfort zone and I was trying to push myself because my therapist said to do that to build confidence  (though idk if that's what he had in mind exactly lol)

Tips:  


-go all out and get makeup/hair done, waxing etc.  get a good nights sleep and be relaxed and confindent



-a good photographer is worth the money.  research what you want and look at their portfolio. 


I wasn't afraid being in lingerie or nude infront of the camera because the lady was so professional and plus she has seen it all already!   I think they were tastefully done and I recommend a lady to do it in the 'female gaze' instead of the 'male gaze'


-one weird thing is that a male photographer that she knew asked if I wanted to do photos for free but I didn't know what that meant - I couldn't figure out why someone would wanna take free photos of me  or what would happen to the photos so I said no. 


Hope this helps!

"&gt; As I've mentioned on here a couple times, I was at a wedding once where the groom slept with a bridesmaid at the reception. So that was the worst I've seen.

Whaaat the fuck :( "
I often hear women talk about how well 'trained' their husbands are. Like he's a dog. It's unbelievably horrible and it makes me sound like a crazy person for daring to want an equal partner...
That's gotta be the oddest realization.  Was it awkward taking the gift back?
"Women kicking ass/doing physical jobs (police officer, detective, military, etc.) with heels on or with their long, flowing, hair down. Both are dangerous and impractical and constantly overused in popular media."
"I like it when people do that, but with food. "

It's a very hilarious delusion. They think the average 30 something man looks like Ryan Gosling and that when they're older they'll suddenly become physically attractive. 
"Yes, sexual assault is fairly prevalent in India. Yes, most women have to account for safety while making their daily decisions - travel, going out, housing, etc.

Having said that, it is also possible to lead a completely 'regular' life with the same dangers as any other big city. I grew up in Bangalore and then went on to live in Boston, Jakarta, and now Delhi. 

Sexual assault is real, and much more prevalent, in Delhi. But my life and choices (and risk) remain similar to those in other cities. A large part of it has to do with the privilege with which I live in Delhi. I can use Ubers generously when I want to, I can choose to avoid public transport if I want to and I live in a 'posh' residential colony with seemingly high security. Are there times when I feel unsafe? Yes. Is this higher than in Boston? Yes. But is it markedly higher? I don't think so. 

However, this doesn't take away the fact that this is not the reality for most single, working women in Delhi. "
I found that accurate in lots of ways but it was worded in such a way that it's a very....traditional view of men and women's roles and a little patronizing to women frankly
"I honestly have no idea. Except, well, to be honest this friend is not an attractive girl physically and not the brightest crayon in the box either. At the time this started, most of the other girls we grew up with were getting boyfriends and losing their virginity as they started college, and I think she just came up with this stuff as a way to find guys who would give her attention? I'm speculating, though."
"I remember that one too, so it definitely happened.

As I recall, it was basically, ""guys have this inner voice thing that follows trains of thought... do women have that?"""
"I think that if this works for everyone involved then great. 

Personally it's not for me, I like sharing a home with my partner. I have a lot of need for alone time and that's still possible for me in our apartment. Also purely financially, since I already *want* to share a home with my partner, it would be a waste for us to have to pay for two different homes. 

So it's not for me, but I don't see an issue with other people enjoying it."
"&gt; Did someone walk in on them doing it or something?  
  
You're talking to that person, friend :/   
  
Yeah it continued but weirdly and full of tension. Most of the guests didn't know or find out, but a select few did and reacted.... poorly (understandably). An aunt of the bride got so sloshed she had to be carried out of the venue while drunkenly raging. The bride wanted the reception to continue so she could save face and pretend nothing was wrong. Divorced within the year. "
"The undercurrent that women are all after men's money and they need to protect it by withholding material gifts and locking down a pre-nup.

"My actual wedding went ok, but my Mormon mother tried to do her best to sabotage it. I married a Catholic and we had a Catholic ceremony (minus the mass). Mum was massively upset at having to attend a Catholic ceremony! She wasn't going to attend at all but my siblings convinced her it would be petty not to. She sniped and snarked all through the preparations, didn't help at all but made demands that interfered with the rest of us, looked dour all through the ceremony, and kept commenting that it wasn't a real wedding (since it wasn't a temple marriage). I am sure it was her that ""coughed"" when the priest said the ""till death do you part"" bit (Mormon temple marriages are ""for time and eternity"").

Then after the ceremony my new father-in-law made the mistake of asking her if she would look after the wedding certificate (she had a large carry-all with her as she was carrying around her scriptures so she could make a show of reading them). She ""lost"" wedding certificate. The priest had to make a statutory declaration that he had actually married us."
"-A woman's core plot revolving around fertility, motherhood, or pregnancy.

-The ""shameful secret that makes her less than human and motivates her to be a villain"" is that she's infertile.

-Even though this is a total fantasy world involving dragons, there is a 45% maternal mortality rate, and a 0% infant mortality rate, unless it harms the protagonist in some way (the woman/mother is never the protagonist).

-If someone is pregnant, the entire plot then becomes their pregnancy.  Abortion or adoption is never once considered or mentioned, regardless of time period.  All pregnancies are carried to term, there is never a miscarriage, unless it can be used to harm the protagonist or antagonist in someway (the woman is never the protagonist)

-""It's (insert year/fantasy setting)!  Rape is common!""  This of course always means that the rape is presented in incredible, graphic detail, often taking up at least 10 minutes of screen time, and contributes absolutely nothing to the plot.

-The main woman character making a ""choice"" to dress in an outfit that is incredibly impractical and almost obscene."
My husband filled our living room with 200 balloons to propose to me 
"I signed up for okc on a whim last summer, and I met two men. The first, I was physically attracted to from the get go. We had a no-strings attached, casual sex relationship. I didn't enjoy his humor or his company very much now that I think about it. I just came back for the sex. It was exciting to be desired, but there was no spark other than sexual chemistry. 

I was still on the site when I finally decided to meet the second guy. We went on three first dates. What was supposed to be a simple fro-yo date evolved into going to the movies soon after, then dinner, and then a late night beach trip--all in one day. I felt the spark, but I still didn't want to believe that I actually found someone online I could have a real relationship with. 

The next day, I went over to the first guy's house. He immediately carried me into the bedroom before I could even set down my bag...and I felt nothing. I wasn't even interested in the sex anymore. My mind kept drifting back to the second guy, wondering why he hadn't texted me back yet. That's when I knew. 

I broke things off with the first guy the next morning. I went on many more dates with the second one, deleted the app within a month, and became his official girlfriend soon after. We just celebrated our one year anniversary last night."

"I hate hearing about how high their sex drive is. Like, I get the root of it is that women stereotypically have a lower drive than men, and that it's important to know that's not always the case. But it does get annoying hearing about how someone can have a million and one orgasms and is just *soooo* sexual they can't imagine going a day without it. It's like, congrats? I guess? I don't know, it seems to be a huge point of pride for these women- like how sexual you are is the contest for who can be the most enlightened, modern, liberated woman. It gets annoying. "

"I work for a nonprofit and we can only use our funds for specific disaster relief related things. As you can imagine, we've received a lot of phone calls over the last few days asking for hurricane relief. Unfortunately we haven't been able to help as many people as we'd like, so a few of the calls have turned tense. I was on the phone with a woman who wasn't going to receive help, and prepared for a barrage of hostility, but all she said was, ""Thank you sweet girl, I know you've done all you can."" I immediately burst into tears and am actually choking up now because, even when she is in one of the darkest times of her life, she was able to find a silver lining in my response to her. It was really sweet and has helped me continue to respond to people positively. "

"This one wedding I went to. They didn't hire a music band but apparently they also didn't choose the songs other than their first dance song. The venue played a bunch of songs that were soooo different than the style. Imagine a crowd of pop and rock fans listening to country. It was clear they also didn't even check the lyrics, some of the songs were about break-ups and revenge, I promise they even played I Will Survive (OK, that part was funny.) The bride's big wedding dress did not fit well with the size of chairs, nobody considered that I guess. Even putting two seats together didn't help, the length of the seating part wasn't big enough for that dress. More importantly, the groom was a very shy, socially awkward guy. He was doing well at the vows ceremony but at the wedding place, which was more crowded, the whole night you could tell he was super uncomfortable."

Yeah I only learned about the pee after sex thing when my bff got a UTI that turned into a horrible bladder infection because she also didn't know this. It would have been nice if...I don't know...some kind of sex education had been taught to us and told us this so my bff didn't have to go to the emergency room in horrible pain to find this out. 
"My now-husband came up to me while I was work. Apparently he was walking past with his friend, saw me and stopped in his tracks.

We have been very happily married for 6 years now :) "
"Okay, imagine growing up with a kosher diet and an Internet connection. Everyone online is telling you how amazing this taboo food is, and for years you secretly envy them.

You get your friends to suggest a brand, then you fry it just right and... It's not any better than turkey bacon.

"My nephew's wedding started 20+ minutes late. There was real concern it wouldn't happen at all. The bride really disliked my brother-in-law and didn't want him there. He did attend but sat in the back. During the ceremony, the bride didn't smile once and maintained distance between herself and my nephew. They didn't even hold hands or lock arms or anything when they walked down the aisle at the end of the wedding. At the cake and punch reception (paid for by my sister-in-law and brother-in-law), she still didn't smile. The whole day, she just looked like she wanted to be some place else, any where but at her own wedding. After the cake and punch reception, our nephew told us (his extended family) that there was going to be a BBQ dinner at the home of the bride's family or maybe at a family friend's house. But we never got an address so no one from our family attended the BBQ. He called his mother later wanting to know where we all were. Their daughter was born about four months later and they divorced two months after that. "

I don't have any kids (which apparently means I have no idea what being tired is...eyeroll) but it seems like whenever I follow a blogger or something and they have kids, anything they post about their children is picked apart by other moms. I don't even see the point in doing that...why be mean to another parent who's just trying to do their best? "
Give less fucks. Seriously. Dress for your size. Not every item of clothing will look the same on everyone. Do something that makes you happy. Make goals and crush them. 
"I once worked in a youth home/group home for kids in out of home care. I had a regular house that I worked in and that was fine with no problems, i was able to manage any challenging behaviours that came up.

One day I was asked to do an emergency shift at another house. I was going overseas soon and I wanted the extra shifts. It wasn't until half way through my shift that I found out that this house wasn't supposed to have a female staff member because it wasn't safe. One of the teenagers (who was double my weight and significantly taller than me) threatened to rape me and continued to act in a really menacing way. I called the office and told them to get a replacement staff member and they said there was no one available to replace me so I would have to finish my shift. I declined and told them that I was leaving and to take this as my notice and I won't be coming back to work. "

"I'm 44. I have to say that my life right now is pretty awesome. I bought a townhome 8 years ago that is perfect for my lifestyle, and since I live alone, everything basically stays the way I want it. I've basically furnished the whole house to cater exactly to my preferences, so there are a lot of throw blankets, soothing colors with bright accents, soft lighting, candles, etc.

I don't have to worry about anyone:

* Spending money unexpectedly that was earmarked for bills
* Making a mess that I have to either tolerate or clean up
* Disturbing my sleep
* Wrecking my stuff or using it without permission
* Using the last of something and not replacing it

And pretty much everything that comes with someone sharing your living space. My home is my sanctuary, and quite frankly, as much effort as I put into making it that way, the less I'm into the idea of giving someone the opportunity to make it their space as well.

I do the usual stuff anyone does: go to work, come home, feed pets, do housework, pay the bills. I live kind of out in the country, so I've tried to make a point to have parties/open houses and invite people over. As I get older, the more obvious it is to me that it is important to INITIATE frequently in order to nurture and develop relationships, even (and especially) friendships.

All of that takes up most of my time, and to be honest, I feel the happiest and most on point when I have a reliable rhythm that I can count on to accomplish what I need to do. Dating is fun, but it throws that all out of whack, and just seems to create a lot of extra work for ...not a lot of benefit. I enjoy being a good host and sharing the comfort of my space with others, but it seems like it quickly leads to the expectation that they can just come over and enjoy the services of Lasciel's Hotel and Spa without considering the burden that places on me, or that I might like my efforts to be reciprocated.

My home means a lot to me, and is the foundation of everything else I accomplish in my daily work, so I am definitely not inclined to mess that up.

Cons: 

It can be a lot of work. Sadly, house elves are not a thing so it's on me to keep up on everything, even if I'm sick or have other things to do. I have to start thinking about what to do if I get injured at home. Having my alone time be so enjoyable makes it habit-forming, and that can be isolating. And not having the safety net, so to speak, of someone else who is invested in my well-being can be intimidating. But that just makes it even more important to develop a good social circle and to put in what I want to get out of it.

Those cons are pretty minor, though. I can think of so many people, online and off, who are married and whose spouses are basically checked out, who ditch them when they're incapacitated, who wreck their financial security, etc. etc. so I am *very* well aware that having a partner is NO guarantee of stability or security. Just the opposite, even. (And I've dated a few guys like that, and am really glad I didn't marry any of them, because I definitely wouldn't have the life that I have now.)"

"Women are socialized relationally instead of competitively. We aren't taught to associate our femininity with dominance, but dominance is an integral part of masculinity. I also think women in general are taught that if we're unsuccessful it's because of something we did, whereas men are taught that if they're unsuccessful it's because of something someone else did. 

So I think a lot of guys grow up at the bottom of the pecking order, have no capacity to reflect on why or how they ended up there, and wind up looking for someone to blame, and then you end up with people like Eliot Roger who think women have conspired to deprive them of sex they feel entitled to, or shmucks marching with tiki torches because they think Jews and immigrants are stealing their jobs.

"I would do a yarn competition in the spirit of the Great British Sewing Bee or Baking Competition.  

Contestants could be knitters or crocheters (or bistitchual which would probably be advantageous).

Each week would be a new project (shawl, scarf, gloves, purse, slippers, stuffed toy, baby blanket, hat, daily......) with different fibers and weights of yarn.  The contestants would have to use a basic set of patterns that will give them the size and shape for the project but they would get to add their own unique ideas for stitch patterns and colors so each would be different.

Then there would be extra little skill competitions where the winner can win some designer yarns, dyes, tools.....  things like one week getting to shear sheep. Another week spinning yarn.  Another week playing with dyes (using sock blanks and another week using loose hanks). Maybe some weeks doing things they may not have done before in other skills like learning to weave or tat....  basically anything yarn based that broadens knowledge of how yarn can be used and enjoyed outside of just stitching it together.

I think it would be fantastic.  I would watch the hell out of that show.


Edit to add.  Oh and everyone would get to decorate and furnish a cosy work area so they can stitch comfortably for hours on end in a spot that shows off their personality.  There would also be areas with chairs, sofas, and all kind of gathering places to chat while working.    It would be really about everyone learning from each other and increasing their skills and techniques.  Not like shows where sabotaging and drama run rampant."

She is not my friend anymore ðŸ˜¢ He was not drunk and everyone saw his behavior.

The other one, they had picked all the music and didn't have a dj. The music was all one slow quiet beat the whole night with no pauses. I don't know where they found their music at but it had no lyrics and people couldn't even slow dance to it. People were heading home at 8 and the place was almost empty by 9:30.

&gt;Have you ever had to end a relationship over it? 

Not over porn consumption, but I have ended relationships over porn preferences being brought into the bedroom without my consent.

I'm not ""no porn ever"", but I would prefer to not be around if my partner is watching it, and I would prefer to not see it in browser histories. It's common courtesy in shared living spaces or on shared devices, right? 

I don't think this is exactly insecurity, but I don't need to know if he likes them to look underage or fit a cartoonish beauty standard because *that* would kick my insecurities into overdrive.

You didn't? Making your child give you all their money for years and taking them to drop off applications for their 16th birthday in order to do so isn't generally indicative of fantastic parenting.
I have burned a hole thruogh many pairs of panties. 
"&gt; that men can't be at a park with their kids 

I agree with everything you said but this one in particular is so funny because where I live there are 3 big parks near our house I go to every day and there are lots of single dads with their kids. No one assaults them, no one even cares about them. They just play there like everybody else."
"I took the last name Cox when I got married. It's shorter and easier to both pronounce and spell than my maiden name.

I also think it's funny but I am apparently an 11 year old boy stuck in a 34 year old woman's body."
"Im envious of my bf, he has a huge group of friends he hangs out with and i just sit at home waiting for him to come back."
"&gt; The goal isn't even to come to conclusions the goal is simply to think.

I don't know you, but I like you a whole hell of a lot."
"Yeah, like arguments are arguments, but to have no warning or a conversation explaining the reason the guy wants to end the relationship....? As she put it, she'd rather be cheated on than left without closure or any reason why he just disappeared after 8 years of building and planning a life together."
"one time I was at a networking event  with wine and cheese at university.  One of the older CEOs of a larger company was going from group to group  and chatting.  When he joined the group I was chatting with, people asked him questions about his career and at some point in the conversation, he said something like ""and if you play your cards right, one day you'll have a very pretty secretary, just like this young lady here"" and he slapped his hand on my shoulder. 


I wasn't even studying in secretarial school or anything and there was no reason for him to assume that I was a secretary"
In many many ways women are taught to prioritize men's feelings over their comfort.

"I went to do my laundry in my complex's tiny, TINY laundry room. It has four machines along the wall, an aisle wide enough for one person to stand and another to squeeze by, and then a table on the other side of the ""aisle."" 

Anyway, I went in there one morning and found a homeless man sleeping on the table in there. Uhh okay, not sure how you got in, but whatever. I said hello a couple times to wake him up. He asked me what time it was. I told him, and he said ""Shit!"" and started rushing out to leave, but not before tidying up the space and blankets he had been sleeping on.

So while he was doing that, I stood outside the doorway of the laundry room. He exited the room with a handful of garbage, walked across the driveway to the dumpster, and began walking back toward the laundry room. As he approached me, he said in an annoyed tone, ""What are you doing standing there all dazed and confused? You can go about your business.""

I said ""Yeah, ok,"" but I didn't move. I stood there holding my laundry basket. He went in and continued gathering his things. He looked at me and again told me I should just go about my business.

Look buddy, I don't care that you broke in here to sleep. But no, I am not going to walk into this tiny room with you, alone, and stand at the washing machine which is in the deepest corner of the room while you are blocking the only exit. I wasn't afraid of you until you started angrily implying that I shouldn't be. "
"The older I get, the more I realize that this sort of statement usually just means you have really appallingly underdeveloped social skills. Strange thing to brag about. "
