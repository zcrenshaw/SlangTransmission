No. People with issues like assholes. People, including women, with a healthy sense of self don't go for assholes.

"It's really hard to have friendships with men.  I took up a hobby that is relatively male-dominated and I had to take a step back from it recently because I could not deal with all the unwanted attention I got.  I would strike up conversations with people just to be friendly and nine times out of ten it would lead to the person trying to pursue me romantically or just doing/saying something creepy.  So it can be isolating and it's caused me to retreat into my shell more.  I might return to the hobby when I'm no longer single and therefore hopefully less of a target. 


That said, have absolutely nothing against any individual dude who asks me out.  I really, really admire folks who take the risk of asking somebody out directly and can graciously take no for an answer.  But there are also so many dudes who just kind of weirdly hover around me or slide into my DM's constantly without ever actually being direct about their interest, and being around that kind of energy makes me super-uncomfortable.

These days, most of my guy friends are exes with whom I'm still on friendly terms."

"Exactly like how they are in the messages and r/niceguys except they seem to think they can massage you

They follow you. Make “clever” comments on those around them, in an attempt to put others down and make themselves seem intellectually superior. 

A lot of patting themselves on the back. They say “you aren’t like other girls” A LOT. Trying to make you seem better/more worthy but the instant they realize you are in fact human, they throw tantrums and blame you for it. 

“You were the chosen one! I believed in you” and just as dramatic as Obi-Wan in that scene too. 


Then they later come back and apologize, citing their deep emotions and how much they like you as fault. Again blaming you for their inability to human.

I work with a lot of men in their 30s and 40s, none of whom have daughters.  Holy crap, I hear more vitriol for Justin Bieber than I thought ever possible.  The majority of them have never heard a Justin Bieber song (or so they claim).  I also do not enjoy Justin Bieber, but his music isn't made for me to enjoy anyway, and I have in fact heard enough of his songs to say ""nope, this definitely isn't for me.""  But I hear endless, unsolicited complaints about Justin Freaking Bieber on the regular.  None of it is based on the shenanigans he gets up to in tabloids, either, so they aren't complaining that he's a bad person or a poor role model.  Just ""how dare Justin Bieber sing his dumb songs.""  

Apply this to anything.  Books, TV shows, clothing, social media.....if it's consumed or directed at teenage girls, it is automatically bad.  No one stops to consider ""wait, I'm a 40 year old man....maybe Pretty Little Liars and liquid lipstick aren't about *me*, and I shouldn't worry about it any more than I worry about Matchbox cars or curling matches.""

"Going to a club to see a couple of my friends play a set, I was getting more and more amped up as I got closer to the venue. At first I didn't register that my stress level was through the roof, I'm going down the block to the door and just feeling super jittery, and I reach the club and don't even pause, just continue walking right past the door and went home. It was *almost* autopilot, because I knew what I was doing, but it was just... happening. I just did *not* want to be there at that moment, my brain basically just said ""No, you aren't doing this"". And I'd been there before, I was meeting friends, there was no reason for me to feel like that - I just did.  
  
Anyway, so I went home, felt *ridiculous* because that's out of character for me and I don't really have social anxiety or anything, so I was feeling guilty for missing their set after saying I'd be there...

"The United States government infected thousands of African American sharecroppers with syphilis in 1932 to study the efficacy of various treatments. 

Once it was discovered that antibiotics cured syphilis the government continued to withhold treatment and ensure the subjects didn't know they had the disease so they could study the long term effects of syphilis on the human body and track how the disease spreads on an epidemiological scale. The experiment wasn't shut down until 1972, it ran for forty years.

Like, Apple is a cute nickname and a cute name for a baby. But, that kid is eventually going to grow up and have to introduce herself as Apple. ""Hi, I'm Apple Paltrow"" just sounds ridiculous to me.

I think too many parents want their kids' names to reflect how cool/quirky/unique *the parent* is and don't think about the fact that a name is usually a lifetime commitment and the kid is a separate person. ""My daughter Apple"" sounds like a thing a really interesting parent would say. ""I'm Apple"" doesn't sound like a thing a really interesting person would say."

"I think one problem is you never know if you received any favors because of your merit, or your physical appearance. 

I also feel a little uncomfortable when I interact with men. I never know if they think I am interested when I am not.  I keep my head low. I have had men tell me I am full of myself, and they were just trying to say hello, not have sex with me. 

People comment endlessly about how you look all the time, instead of the substance you may have to offer. Looks are nice but it isn't something you necessarily earned. 

A lot of unwanted crushes/attractions from coworkers, as I work in a male dominated field. I can sense the staring at my breasts, my body, etc. 

I feel more responsible when I fail because people will think it is expected, as I am just a pretty and dumb chic. Therefore I work 10 times harder. "
" A lot of them are  scary to encounter in real life as a woman. Failing to recognize appropriate boundaries is one thing online, it's quite another in person.

Have a hospital birth? You're just brainwashed and contributing to the baby industrial complex.

"The mom of a girl I dated back in high school had a boyfriend with a nice house. My favorite part was the atrium in the middle of the house. It was filled with beautiful plants and flowers with water running through it and a small stocked koi pond.

"There is a man who works at a home store I frequent often. First time he met me to help me load furniture, he kept touching my shoulders or back and was just overall in my personal space. I got home that night to see that “Jimmy” had put a note in my purse with his name and number when he was hanging all over me that day. So cringe-y. 

I never called, never even considered, showed my BF the note and tossed it. Now every single time I go in there after that,  he puts a note or a business card in my purse yet again begging me to call. 

Annoyed one weekend by the prospect of having to brush him off yet again,  I left my purse at home then went shopping and he got UPSET WITH ME and confronted me. Asked me “how else was he supposed to keep communicating with me if I had a boyfriend” to which I replied you don’t, and asked him to leave me alone for at least the 6th time. Told the store manager that day and haven’t been back since. 

These kinds of people have NO boundaries, and you can often tell pretty early on, thankfully. "

"It is known that the universe is expanding, and that there is some mysterious pressure causing the universe to actually accelerate in its expansion.

This means that at some point, parts of the universe will actually extend past our horizon - meaning we will lose the ability to see and study those stars, planets, and galaxies.

This means that there will come a generation of scientists who will be able to read about all these cosmic discoveries, but who will never be able to witness them. As Neil deGrasse Tyson put it, for them it will be as though a chapter had been ripped from history.

But we have no way of knowing if we were already missing chapters to begin with."

"Almost. The government didn't infect them, they just targeted a population where it was likely rampant and narrowed their study to those affected. This shaves very little shame off the government, and everything else you said is accurate. I only butted in because it's a very common misconception. Also, our government has infected vulnerable populations with diseases in other studies. In fact, the US was infecting prisoners with malaria just before WW2 ended, which was awkwardly brought up by the Nazi's defense lawyers during the Nuremberg trial! Our guy dodged the questions, even lied a bit, and then helped draft the Nuremberg Code. As you correctly noted, the Tuskegee study had already started and continued until the 70s.

My husband took off on his motorcycle to deliver some mail to our son who had recently moved out of the house.  A while later I hear sirens and think, ""He's turned that bike over.  That's the ambulance coming.""  I very calmly got cleaned up (we had been working in the yard), got my shoes and purse and waited for my neighbor to come to the door and tell me that yes, my husband had wrecked his motorcycle and was on his way to the hospital.  

Got to work one morning when my boss was on vacation.  It suddenly occurred to me that he might return early if something happened to his mother (in a nursing home).  Sure enough, an hour later my boss and his wife walked in having returned from vacation two weeks early because his mother passed away overnight.

"Complain about how much makeup women buy, complain about how long it takes us to put it on, call us frivolous and vain, say that makeup is ""cheating"", etc. etc. 

Then when women don't wear makeup, we get constant comments that we look sick, that we're being lazy, that we're not putting effort into our appearance. 

Oh, and the classic ""women only wear makeup to impress guys, so you should listen to every opinion we have about makeup"". Uggggggh."
"There have been studies done where even if women speak up, like, 30-40% of the time and men speak up 60+% of the time, men see women as “dominating” the conversation.

In truth, I’ve found that many men talk a LOT because they think what they’re saying is very important. The only reason they think women talk a lot is because they make the misogynistic assumption that what women say is “frivolous small-talk, gossip, and chit-chatter” (never mind the fact that small talk is a conversational art and one that men can be VERY poor at) and they dislike hearing women’s voices. That’s honestly it. "
"Generally hating on things young women like. So what if they drink a lot of Starbucks? It has no effect on your life. It's, not, like, my thing personally, but why does that get hated on and me making coffee for myself every morning is totally fine?

"I feel like you have to try extra hard to be friendly and forthcoming so people drop the assumption that you're a vapid/rude/petty/arrogant/judgemental. It sucks when people won't even entertain the idea that you're just you and will be down right rude to you regardless. 

Some guys don't ever want to be just friends. If they can't get romantic or sexual, it's like they can't see you any other way. Or other girls think you're after their man...no thanks. I'm neutral to everyone and treat everyone the same. I'm just automatically friendly and nice, not flirting. 

Like others have said, some think you're dumb as rocks with no personality. I feel like I'm complaining. I was an ugly duckling growing up so I suppose I've seen both sides of the coin. It's just hard not to take it personally, to remind yourself that sometimes people are just taking their anger and insecurities out on you and it has nothing to do with you.

"I've known many people who seem under the impression that being an attractive woman is a life full of opportunity, kindness and positive attention because of our looks, but don't see the other side of it, and even when told about it, make very little effort to understand, because they believe the positive parts outweigh the negative parts.

What is the other side of it? Remember that girl you went to school with when you were twelve? The one who maybe developed a bit early or was pretty and was adored by the boys and was friends with only them, with the exception of a frenemy or two? The one all the girls bullied or were passive-aggressive towards and spread rumors she let all the boys feel her up? Every school had one. Its pretty much a trope now. The trope extends to the womans adult life; you know the woman who gets by in life by using her looks, develops no personality or skills than ends up alone by forty, wondering what happened? I see redditors discussing real women, expecting exactly that to happen to them.

Imagine being that girl and being completely aware of the situation. Thats a part that is rarely, if ever shown; god forbid we posses even a shred of self awareness or an IQ that consists of more than a single digit. But seriously, imagine that. Imagine spending your early adolescence, dealing with the aggression of other girls, which is generally emotional and psychological bullying and sometimes borders on straight up abuse, and boys who put you on a pedestal and treat you nicely only because they want to have sex with you. The duality is astounding on its own, but neither forms of attention both good and bad, set you up to be able to trust anyone, let alone want to. Now that sort of treatment is forgivable in young teenagers. But consider the fact that it doesn't end there.

Women still regard you with suspicion and hostility; its like being race car driver sometimes, they like watching you, but they love, love watching you crash and burn. Dramatic? Not really, the really insecure ones try to find something, anything wrong with you, so they can feel superior. Other women try to show you in a bad light to their partners. Some women try to seduce your partner to prove they can ""win"" the competition of attractiveness. Men open doors for you, are friendly to you, sometimes give you free stuff and help you if your car breaks down, ect. Sounds like a big upside until you consider that they are only doing it because they want to have sex with you - it doesn't make you feel flattered or desirable, it makes you feel objectified as fuck. Not to mention the men that can't handle rejection and become verbally or physically abusive - which is terrifying.

There is also the confirmation bias people form: you can't be intelligent, you can't be skilled, you can't be hard working, really your life is on easy mode. You just coast by on you looks and get so many benefits - you can't have gotten that job/car/house through work, some guy must have given it to you!

You sort of become an extension of other peoples' egos - a woman may dislike you because she views you in the ways mentioned above, and feels resentful. Or she likes you because maybe she feels insecure and having an attractive friend feeds her ego. A man may dislike you because he expects women like you to be easy and gets mad that you aren't sexually available to him, but are to everyone else (or so her believes). A man may like you because having an attractive woman around feeds his ego and he might think you'll attract more women. Ironically, it teaches you an awful lot about the human condition, how shallow people truly can be, how much value people place on beauty, and is ultimately a quite dehumanizing existence.


I think this is the third time I've posted this on reddit and the reason is because I can't say these things IRL or public. So many threads like this have comments accusing us of not being self aware, but consider how taboo it is for us, to honestly express that we are aware of how we look. It isn't if you do, but if we do, we are accused of narcissism, vanity, being uppity or having a superiority complex. It is taboo for us to have healthy self-esteem.   Apparently we are a living embodiment of that One Direction song; one can only be beautiful, if they don't know they are.

"Came here to say this. Before I worked in a female-dominated field, I worked in an office that was maybe 70% men. One of the new managers was a woman and so many guys complained that she probably only got the job because of a quota or because she slept with someone. Apparently none of them considered that maybe she was the best candidate for the job. 

Also, if anyone ever said ""Hey, maybe one of the 5 male managers got their job over a perfectly qualified woman just because they're a dude"", they would get a condescending lecture about ""maybe he was just better at NEGOTIATING and ASSERTING HIMSELF and maybe women just aren't meant to be leaders because of their BIOLOGY."" Conveniently ignoring the fact that they probably consider assertive women with good negotiating skills bossy, b*tchy, cold, unapproachable etc etc."

"My dog is absolutely not a cuddler. He's getting old and has arthritis, so he usually likes to sit in his own space. But...

Whenever I give the dog a gentle muscle and joint massage --either on cold mornings or after a walk-- he always leans over and gives my hand a few licks, like he's saying thank you. 

For my SO, I know it's when there is a thunderstorm. My dog almost never leaves my side and usually just straight up ignores my SO, but the moment there's a storm he asks to sit in my SO's lap. You know, for safety. My SO always acts like it's an inconvenience but I have totally caught them snuggling!"

"My junior year of high school I was in an English class. There was a guy there that you could tell wasn't the greatest at social cues. He would chime into the conversation with completely random comments (we would be talking about Doctor Who and he'd give us a fun fact about the Vietnam War), and he stared for an extensive amount of time and my friends and I. After school I had to wait an hour or so for my bus to get there so I was just walking around campus. He saw me and ran up to me and attempted conversation. Then he said ""I really like your red hair, it's very pretty"" ""Thank you"" ""In 6 months, though, when I take you home as my girlfriend my mom won't like it. But that's OK I'll love you anyway.""

Conclusion: The creepy guys are just as creepy in real life as they are online

"When I can tell he's a little nervous, but not crushingly self-conscious.  

When he doesn't try to get too physically close.  I take more than one date to warm up to someone physically, so a hug is perfect.  

"
"yes, the last time i ever saw my grandma, she had dropped me off at my moms. i had an incredibly strong urge to go back with her and cried in the house for a minute before deciding to go back out to give her a hug at least. she was gone and an hour later we got a phone call she had been killed in a car accident. 
i wish i could say that was the only time i have gotten that feeling. it isn't but i have learned to pay close attention to my intuition since then. "
"Still creepy, but they’re not as brave as they are when they’re anonymous online.

One example is this guy I met at university. We talked a decent amount about the video game that we both played, his depression, etc. He kept asking for us to hang out. I’d say that I didn’t feel like going out and he’d ask to bring his computer to hang out at my place. After this I started seeing him everywhere on campus, kept running into him. One day I ran into him twice. I think this was on purpose but I guess I’ll never know. He also kept saying things like he tries so hard with people but never gets anywhere. One day he blew up for no reason on a very harmless Facebook post that I wrote and wouldn’t stop attacking me. I basically said “wtf dude I’ve been nothing but nice to you” and he told me to “stop shoving my kindness in his face” and that I shouldn’t expect special treatment just because I was a girl (??). For weeks or months after he would randomly write passive aggressive comments on various Facebook posts/statuses that I made. I remember I said something like “I wish I was back in England.” (I had just moved to California a few months prior.) and he commented saying “I bet I know why.” (??) Eventually I told him to leave me alone and he blocked me because that obviously gave him the upper hand lol. "
"Every morning before the alarm goes off, my dog gets up from the end of the bed, comes to the top and burrows under the covers for one last, solid snuggle before we get up for work. It makes me melt every time.

Betty White is older than commercially available sliced bread. It was around 4-5 years after she was born that someone patented a machine capable of slicing bread in massive numbers on the production line.
"1. The whole meeting the parents freak out, I get being nervous but the movies make it seem hilariously doomed.
2. The demanding promotion, there shouldn’t really be any issues with this, do these couples not talk about what they’re trying to do with their careers?
3. The hot ex- boyfriend you run into at a bar while out with her, there’s a reason he’s an ex.
4. The first time he cooks her dinner, there’s always a fire or something.
5. How things get serious all of a sudden. In my experience it’s usually a gradual thing and not a surprise to either party. You’re just plodding along taking the logical next step.
6. The proposal. If you’re that serious about each other the M word comes up a lot. You would normally know where she stands on it. If you don’t then you shouldn’t propose.

Edit: your/you’re"
"It's not a pleasant one, but: your belly button is really just your old mouth."
"Probably prude shaming, I wasn't a virgin when I started real ""adult"" dating but I also wasn't interested in hookups or casual sex, nor was I interested in celibacy before marriage or someone deeply religious. I caught a lot of shit from guys who didn't understand that there's a middle ground. They usually decided to make fun of me for it, usually while we were making out. Because THAT'S what's gonna make me wanna have sex. 

Very little slut shaming sticks out in my mind other than an incident where an Evangelical woman told me I was probably going to get raped for wearing a tight t shirt. "
"Scary fact-of-life when you see all the abuse pamphlets readily available at the prenatal appointments. My midwife had a poster on the back of the women’s bathroom door that had lists of symptoms to be wary of, hotline numbers, counseling, women’s shelters, family lawyers and a phrase you can say to her if you feel threatened/unsafe but he’s at the appointment with you.

"i went with my dream job, because i thought it would turn into a legit career. i stuck with it through my twenties, and it never turned into anything resembling a career. i quit that job, started my own company with a friend/colleague, but i'm still not on a fast path to a reasonable career. so now i'm closing in on my 33rd birthday with a couple hundred bucks in my bank account, wondering why i didn't just get a regular job with regular pay. not that i regret my chosen profession, but like, having money would be cool. "
I dated a guy in my early twenties that I felt I had to pester for sex. That was the root of every argument we had over our 18 month relationship. Everything else was great.  Eventually he confessed to me that he was struggling with his sexual identity. We broke up on good terms and he started dating men.  We're both much happier now.  
"We have a couple things. 


Low-key out of the house time: We spend a lot of time together walking the dog, which is always nice. It gets us out of the house and moving. We’ll make tea, stick it in a travel mug, and just walk around the city with pup. 

Low-key at home time: Every couple of weeks we’ll sit down and be awful at Civ 6 together, it’s really fun. Occasionally, we’ll get drunk together and play Fallout 4 (one play through, we take turns playing). We’re also really big on the “being together, but doing separate things”. If one of us is having an off day, or a rough time, we’ll curl up on the couch and whomever is feeling under the weather will just watch the other play video games. We always play the same games when we do this, I play Dishonored, he plays Cities: Skylines. It creates this nice calming effect for us whenever those games are running. 

Going out time: All-you-can-eat Sushi. Literally the only time we go out for dinner just the two of us is for sushi. Spend the evening consuming our body weight in sushi. Every time he runs a marathon, we go for sushi. And then also just whenever we feel like it. 

A lot of our main hobbies are separate. We’ll go to the gym at the same time, but rarely work out together. I don’t go bouldering with him, that’s his time. He doesn’t lift with me, that’s my time. He runs by himself. I swim by myself. I feel like it helps us feel like we’re maintaining individuality, and don’t feel like someone’s intruding in “our space”.

But she's also never let me down :').
"Yes! A friend told us to get cocktail dresses in royal blue, and that was the only guideline. Thanks girl, wore that dress for years. "
"India, if it's a girl.

Democratic People's Republic of Korea if it's a boy."
Taking a normal name like Chelsea and turning it into an abomination like Chelseigh. 
"Probably the first one is mainly-dark color decoration. I really like the look of gray and couple other dark color walls for example, especially when it's combined with colorful throwpillows on the couch and a bunch of pictures on the wall. It's really beautiful. But I know I'd feel depressed if I saw dark colors most of the time so no way I'd have that in my own house."
"I have posted about him so many times on Reddit because of how much he has hurt me. But I recently found the courage to cut off a toxic and narcissistic friend. He made me miserable and is a self-absorbed asshole. Being his friend felt like being trapped in an abusive relationship, but without the romantic aspect as he is gay. Our friendship was always problematic. He had a really rough childhood and has faced a lot of homophobia. His mum also passed away a few years ago. These things made it hard to break free from him. Ever since high school, he has had a lot of trouble maintaining friends. He also doesn't have a proper job and lives off his mum's inheritance and unemployment benefits. People would find his snide remarks offputting and I've had other friends question why I'm friends with this person. I should've listened to them. I came to the realisation that he wasn't adding to my life and that he couldn't genuinely feel happy for me. He also started heaps of drama with some of our mutual friends, and it got to the point where he had hurt too many people for me to be able to stay out of it. I confronted him about everything and ohhhhh boy, he reacted badly. I copped a lot of abuse for it. He blames everyone else for his shitty behaviour and has no sense of accountability. I stopped replying to his abusive messages and haven't spoken to him since. I've also deleted/unfollowed him on all social media. The only thing I regret is not cutting him out of my life sooner. My mental health has really improved since I removed the narcissist from my life, which shows how emotionally taxing our friendship was. "
Yeah my midwife had a policy that the first appointment the woman had to go in alone for the first ten mins then the father could come in. First thing she asked was do you think you are in any danger and if there was anything in my medical history that I needed to tell her but didn't want to disclose to him. Good policy but so sad its something she felt was necessary.
"I was pretty conservative in college and used to be more like this (am moderate-liberal now), so I hope this can offer helpful perspective.

The people who oppose that sort of thing often view it as the ones in the ""safe space"" covering their ears and refusing to listen. They don't see it as ""I'm setting an area for myself and others where I can talk to people who understand and not be interrupted by people who don't""...they see it as ""I want to live in a bubble and never examine viewpoints that aren't my own"", whereas they often feel like they're constantly challenged by other viewpoints, so they feel like if they can't have that ""safe space"" then their opponents can't either. Or, they see it as someone telling them they're wrong and then refusing to listen to their argument.

Of course, it's misguided. I'm not saying this what I believe, just explaining it as I understood it from someone who used to listen to people like that."
"Yep. And sometimes when they follow you, they try to play it off as a coincidence. “Oh hello yes what a surprise to see you here at the place you go to for lunch every day at this time hahaha I already ate but I guess I’ll come in with you and sit at your table and watch you eat.”"
"Whether or not a ""10"" should be dating a ""6"" If she is dating you and/or sleeping with you, she obviously sees something in you. Why bother wondering about whether it's normal, right or weird and just enjoy it. You obviously find her gorgeous, don't screw this up with insecurities. Always drives me nuts."
"Sometimes it makes sense.  Some people have these looong lists of criteria that their ideal person should be -- he needs to be tall and blonde and blue eyed, and into these bands, and have this sort of career making this kind of money....  And that's just not realistic.  Those aren't standards -- they're illusions.  

Sometimes it doesn't make sense.  Sometimes the standards you're trying to maintain are ""treats me with respect"" and ""emotionally stable"" and ""can communicate well"" or ""doesn't abuse drugs"" or whatever.  And those are the sort of standards that you should absolutely maintain for your own well-being."
"&gt; “Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

&gt; Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much!

"Words on walls are stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I'm talking ""EAT"" in the kitchen ""PLAY"" in whatever room your child plays, ""READ"" over the bookcase like ... why? What is this supposed to be? I also hate ""In this family, we ...."" type boards or whatever. I just hate it.

One of my favorite out of this world facts is that there's enough space from the Earth to the Moon to snugly fit every single one of the other planets betwixt them.
Friend of mine’s father died and left her a large amount of money. She decided to blow 100% of it on a fantasy wedding at age 22 to some guy she ended up divorcing a year later. 
"Entertaining areas. When I go to look at other homes, I am always amazed at the amount of square footage is only for entertaining. A bar in the basement, a movie theater, a pool, etc. “this a 4000 sq ft house!” Well yeah but only 2000 of it is daily living space.

"all woman are like that (that being shallow, manipulative, out for your money, ''hypergamous'', what have you). 

like look, it gets to the point where the common denominator is you. at one point, i had to examine my own role in the fact that all the men i was meeting (and attracting) were shitty. they gotta do the same."
"That happened to me this weekend. Some dude asking me out, I had already told him that I was interested but  had a packed weekend so I would text him to let him know. Saturday morning my water is cut off for maintainence, while the weather is 38°C with 80% humidity. When I explained to him on Sunday that I wouldn't go out with him because I was without water since saturday morning and hadn't had  a shower since Friday night this dude kept pestering, he wouldn't take my no for an answer. I told him that if he couldnt respect such a valid choice to not hang out I couldn't put my trust in him so we won't be hanging out in the future.


Damn, boys, learn to take a fucking no for an answer. If you try to cross my reasonable boundary you'll not get to fuck me because i wont feel safe around you."
"I just felt something weird happen to me after reading this. I feel very small and trapped in a way that I cannot explain, like the earth is trapped in the vastness of the universe. It's a scale of incomprehensible distances yet still seems small when you imagine being trapped inside of something. I feel this in my own body right now. 


None of what I'm saying makes sense because what I'm feeling doesn't make sense and now I think I need a blanket. "

"This came up on a first date once and, without skipping a beat, I listed off Jessica, Christina and Tiffany.

"It's upsetting  because sexual assault takes away your sense of ownership over your own body and agency over your on life sort of.  Part of what makes us human is to own our own bodies and shape our own story, therefore one of the most dehumanizing things you can do to people is to either objectify them, take away their control over their own body, or treat them as public property etc."
"Pushed two of the little darlings out her vagina. Wasn’t as sexy as putting them in there to be honest.

Turned out ok in the end. "
"The old desk from The Colbert Show.
I worked as a maid for the woman that owned it. I think she won the desk? Not a functional desk in any way, but she used it as her office desk (she ran a business in her home).  It took up so much space, and it didn’t have any drawers or shelves. It’s just a huge prop. 

She also freaked the fuck out if anyone touched it.

"How difficult it is to “know” what women want...

Communication and emotional intelligence are skills that require a certain level of expertise from both parties in order to make a successful relationship. They are skills that we can improve independently or together. If you don’t know what anyone of any gender wants, then you just ask them."
"Me and my friends were out in the city going to clubs etc and we were all dancing in a circle. Suddenly my single friend had found a guy to dance with and we were all pretty excited for her. I went back to dancing but something told me to look up and I saw her being dragged by him to the bathrooms. I was the only one who saw and so I ran and grabbed her. 
If I hadn’t looked up in that moment something really bad could have happened. We told the bouncers and they kicked him out. It really freaked her out but I’m so glad I saw and got her out of that situation. 

TL;DR: friend got dragged away by a guy at the club, I was the only one who saw and managed to get her out of there. "
"I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. I think a good relationship makes both parties better people. However if you’re just waiting for a relationship to motivate you to fix things you already know are a problem, that’s a red flag."
"I found that oddly cute. ""Time to wash the skeleton!"" Brushy brushy. "
"My husband was a very healthy guy. He was a vegetarian and in all the years we were together he only got sick like 5 times and they were all minor colds.
 One night i had a dream of him dying, in my dream he was lying in a hospital bed leaning to the side puking blood then doctors rushed to him and he passed not long after that. It was a very random dream especially because he apparently felt fine, but i got scared and urged him to have a check up. He did and they found pancreatic cancer stage iv. He had no symptoms before the diagnosis. 

Before he was intubated and consequently passed what i had dreamt months before happened. We were in the hospital and he was talking with the kids and suddenly he leaned to the side and puked. He passed 3 days later.

"Slut shaming by far. I'm pretty young (18) and nobody cares that I'm a virgin. People who have sex or feel comfortable talking about are always ""hoes"". Does not make me excited to start having sex."
"This is an interesting anecdote, but as a side note for any women reading this - do not automatically assume that your guy might be gay because his libido dips. 

Far and away the more common reason is exhaustion and stress. "
Its always a balance between being goofy and trying to show you can be mature at times. Then again intangible chemistry helps a lot. 
"back when i was a very attractive teen girl, i was waiting at the bus stop after my job. two friendly looking men approached me and started talking to me. i lived in an abusive house and was very shy and brainwashed into deferring to men in all situations. my mother made my talk to any boys who were interested in me.

that said, i was chatting with them and one of them said ''you're very attractive, can i have a hug?'' and the very moment i leaned in, alarms sounded. stupid, STUPID. it's blurry from here, but i desperately thrashed and tried to get away, while they held me and cooed at me ''come on [name they read from my name tag]''. i finally broke away and by some miracle my bus was pulling up and i went straight in.

to this day i'm not sure what would have happened, because it was broad daylight. but people have been stabbed and robbed and worse during the day there, so who knows. i had to have known that something terrible could happen, because i was used to taking abuse without question."

I still miss him sometimes but the choice was easy for me.

"Also “asshole” can frequently mean “A man who has his own hobbies, stands his ground, and doesn’t put the woman on a pedestal like she’s some infallible goddess.” They see a dude arguing with his girl or playfully teasing her and are like “OMG WHAT AN ASSHOLE, I WOULD NEVER!!!!!!” Lol I don’t need a slobbery slave who just agrees with me 24/7 to be my SO. How clingy and annoying would that be. "
"My guy, [Grimace](https://i.imgur.com/q2NfgZg.jpg), does a few things I love. 

* He knows I like kissing him between his eyes so he comes up and puts his face up against my lips. 

* He does this super cute bounce when he wants to play. They're getting fewer cause he's 13.5, but they're still there. 

* I trained him to bark when I ask him ""What?"" so I love doing that to him. His barks are pretty dang cute.   "
We hired this guy like 6 years ago that came in to a high paying role in our department.  In his first week he made disparaging remarks about gays and started blocking my access to various systems that I maintain.

"In France English names were really popular for a while.  Kévin, William, Steven etc were all very popular and i hated them all.  I like my names to be French af eg, MARIE-FRANCOISE, JULIETTE, PIERRE-MARTIN, HECTOR, JEAN-LUCIEN etc..

All should be pronounced very loudly and frenchly."

"Prude shaming, definitely.  That's not to say I've never been slut shamed, and in some extremely hurtful circumstances.  But, in my experience, people feel a lot more comfortable being vocal about the things you *should* do in bed more than what you shouldn't.  I think it's partly because the people not comfortable with women having sex lives are also less likely to talk about sex in general, and partly that the people who are open to conversations about sex assume that anyone less open/experienced must be repressed and in need of fixing.  

That only applies to comments directed at me, personally, though, and I tend to dress pretty conservatively and keep my sex life private unless asked.  In general, and in the larger conversation about women's sexuality, slut shamers have a much louder voice than prude shamers. "
"First Kiss 101:

1. Dont focus on the kiss, focus on the moment. Look into his/her eyes. Watch for signs that the moment is right. Perhaps a natural silence that settles between you as you talk. If the moment is right, you will feel it, like a current of  electricity running between you. This is what people refer to as ""chemistry"".
2. Look for signs that they are thinking about it too. Might include things like:  Are they looking back at you just as intently? Mouth parted? Face flushed? 
3. Smooth set up.
When you commit, tilt your head just a touch to the left and move in 90% of the way...and pause. If they are ready, they will close the remaining distance and ""seal the deal"" so to speak. If they are not ready, you give them an out to turn their head or something similar. Still awkward but far better than the ""Why did you do that?"" conversation. 
4. Be gentle. Go slow. No tongue."
"Thought of another: that we don't just say what we mean.

Even ignoring the fact that it's often not true and men are just as guilty of it, the problem is that guys are assuming everything is some kind of code or trick question. And often just ignoring it either way because they assume it isn't important"

"My favorite thing about the ""friendzone"" is that in the original context where it was made known to the public at large, it was one man telling another that he put himself in the friendzone.  

How did he do this?  By thinking that he could just be a girl's friend for so long that she would naturally fall for him, instead of actually expressing interest in her.

"People assume you’re stupid. Really sucks when you have a master’s in molecular biology and a Ph.D in veterinary medicine and people still feel the need to explain to you how some mundane shit works.

Women assume that you “must not have anything in common” with them because they assume all you care about is makeup and dresses

People feel the need to talk about or ask you about your appearance rather than anything intellectual or engaging, which can make it hard not to see it as your only value. This has led to me having some very deep and serious insecurities that I’ve had to work on because I ended up worrying that nobody actually cared about who I am, and I had a complete breakdown over it.

It can be hard to fully trust friendships with the opposite sex

Lots of guys think you’re automatically open to random advances, probably at least in part because of the “people assume you’re an airhead” thing I mentioned earlier

But on the flip side, other guys get really shy and kind of close up, or they seem to feel threatened and get standoffish, when you’re literally just talking to them casually. It’s... very strange and a bit sad honestly. People I might have really liked to be friends with and get to know.

People assume *you* are super judgmental of *other* people’s looks, for some reason. I don’t really get why but it’s a thing.

And lastly, it can be hard to maintain romantic relationships because guys are all excited to be with you because you look beautiful but then once you express actual thoughts and needs, they get overwhelmed and leave, like they got ripped off somehow. It’s like you just aren’t a full human being to them. When you’re average looking you can at least rely on the likelihood that they like you for you, but if you’re above average then it can be near impossible to make that distinction beforehand."

"Yes. Made friends with a coworker when we were both going thru divorces. She was happy and fun when she was getting her independence back. Then she immediately found some guy online dating, married him, and became negative, gossip and racist (??). I had to fade hard on her after that. I’m sure she told people I was “just jealous” of her new online husband since that seemed to be her go-to excuse about people fading on her. Don’t care"

"I'm a man, so I'm sorry if it's inappropriate for me to comment here.

I'm a porn addict. I've been ""sober"" for about a year now, and my decision to quit was motivated chiefly by the fact that my addiction essentially destroyed my relationship with my now ex-girlfriend. It killed my libido, caused a worrisome level of ED and caused some symptoms that can be misdiagnosed as depression.

While the /r/nofap community can get a bit... carried away, so to speak, the sidebar does have a few useful links to literature on the subject.

I'm sharing this with you because widespread porn usage is at an all-time high and it's possible that some cases here are being caused by porn usage. Bear in mind that many of us started using porn when we were as young as 10 years old. Speaking from personal experience, it's an extremely difficult habit to break (I had an easier time quitting smoking). But my life has objectively improved in several ways since I quit."

I don't know why but there are so many guys who come in to my place of work and beeline to myself or another woman to tell us about what they read in the fucking news or saw on CNN or Doctor Oz for 40 minutes. I'M WORKING HERE. They never notice all the customers build up behind them and then get SUPER insulted when I tell them I need to help other people."
"Match day in med school (you’re about to graduate and you find out what kind of doctor you’ll be/where you do residency training at the exact same time on a Friday as every other senior in the country). Guy opens envelope, pure ecstasy as he lands his top choice program. It also happens to be St. Paddy’s weekend in Chicago. Guy goes out for the celebration of a lifetime, is a plastered idiot at the bars, gets arrested. Program rescinds their offer, guy is jobless with 200k of debt. "
"Not my story, but my mom's. When my mom was a manager at a grocery store, a woman and her young son were checking out at the same time as another customer, a middle-aged man, there by himself. It was nighttime and they were the only customers in the store. My mom asked the woman if she wanted help taking her groceries to her car (as she did with all the customers) and the woman declined.

Then my mom pulled her aside and quietly told her that she didn’t like the way that man at the next register was looking at her, and she urged her to let one of the guys working walk her to her car. She was surprised because she hadn’t noticed him, but she agreed.

About a half hour later, she called the store and asked to speak with my mom. She told her that not only did that guy follow her out of the store and watch her intently the whole time her groceries were being loaded into her car, but he had also parked his van right next to her. He was parked so close to the driver’s side of her car that she could barely get in. His van was arranged perfectly so that he could have pulled her in while she was trying to open her door. Once her groceries were loaded, she drove around town for a while to make sure he wasn’t following her &amp; finally went home. She sounded like she was in tears when she talked to my mom, but she just wanted to let her know how grateful she was that she was looking out for her."
"He worries to the point that he sometimes treats me like a teenager.  Then I call him dad.  Then he gets upset because he's worried.  Then I feel bad. Then I get mad. And then I tell him I've survived so far and why does he think the things he's telling me haven't been drilled into my head since I was 9??  Then he concedes.  Then I leave to go do the thing, and he's a wreck until I return. 


Also he's really bad about telling me things sometimes.  He's been mugged twice and I didn't find out until months later when he was telling someone else the story and I was like ""**YOU GOT MUGGED AT GUN POINT?? WHEN?? WHAT HAPPENED??? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME????**""

I love him so so much, but does he toe the line of love and throttling him sometimes"
"Just FYI, not every dude that's creepy has a cognitive condition. Sometimes they're just shitty people, or entitled, or don't care that they make people uncomfortable.

EDIT: The creep defending is fucking. Real. Why are folks so interested in defending the behavior of hypothetical people who behave in socially unacceptable ways."
"No, OP said they're girls."
"Yep. There is a guy like this in my husband's group of uni friends. They all think he's harmless, but any of us wives/girlfriends who have met him are seriously creeped out by him. It's kind of sad really, because from what they say about him, he's a perfectly nice/normal guy when he's around other guys. If he didn't see women as being some kind of super terrifying other species, he'd probably get on much better with us :/"
The trick is to be rich enough to pay someone to maintain it. 
"Also, why do guys feel like they have to do it one handed?"
"Often times I have found that guys who are cynical about women and think that we're shallow, are only trying to take their money, etc. are guilty of what they accuse women of. They're the ones that only value women for sex and beauty. People reveal a lot about themselves when they talk about others."

"My son's father was abusive. We had broken up before son was born, but he was still verbally abusing me and threatening physical abuse. I was constantly on edge because of it but believed it was my fault.

We went to a lactation consultant and I repeatedly asked for son's dad to be kept out of the room because I wanted privacy. The LC insisted that he stay in to ""help"" and even got him to try hand expressing my breast while I fed our son. I went home and cried. I still am upset by that memory, nearly 5 years later."
"I have two 4th graders, and they came home complaining about some kid in their class who always jacks around and acts like an ass, disrupting class and generally being a pain. I asked his name...

Because of COURSE it is. Saw the kid at their music performance and sure enough, he's everything they described and more. Since the parents were egging on his obnoxious (and disruptive) behavior, it's probably more them than the name... but STILL.

"My mom was positive I was going to be a boy. She also changed our last name from a very Hungarian name to an Americanized one. She wanted to name me “Romeo Montgomery” or “Cordero Chandler.”

I asked my dad once how they came up with Jillian, which is a normal name (but one my mom got from a soap opera.) he said it was the first time my mom mentioned a name that was even remotely normal and he was like YES THATS IT I LOVE IT! JILLIAN IS PERFECT WE DON’T NEED ANY MORE IDEAS "
I have a wealthy aunt who has the most amazing closet I have ever seen. I wouldn't even call it a closet because it looks like a fancy boutique shop that's right in her house and it's about the size of an average bedroom. I don't have nearly enough clothing and shoes to ever justify something like that in my house but its so cool to hang out in there and kinda feel like Carrie Bradshaw for a minute. 
"It doesn't need to go away completely, but I hate that everything is a video now. I've blocked them on my facebook feed because every damn story is a video. I want to skim a news article, not watch a video. It's rare that I see a video with worthwhile content that wouldn't have been exponentially better as a blog post (and I hate how much of the existing traditional blogosphere is now making vlogs in addition or even instead of their regular blog content, in order to stay relevant). Plus the culture of Youtube/Vine-esque stars just seems really nasty and toxic. Finally, it's really time-intensive to consume video content. I like the freedom of being able to scroll through text and images at my own pace, on my own time (not to mention ctrl+f)"

Women enjoying things that aren't done for my approval MAKES ME VERY ANGER &gt;:((((
"ETA: thanks for the gold!

I consider myself moderate-liberal and I'm fine with the concept of safe spaces/trigger warnings in theory but I do have some criticisms (so I can only imagine they'd be magnified if I wasn't liberal):

* A safe space is needed for a group of people who want to discuss their troubles without feeling threatened or harassed.  For example, there are times that I hesitate to talk about feminism on Reddit because it's *not* a safe space and I know some asshole is going to harass me about it.  And I'm not here for that.  I can easily understand why POC and LGBT people want to discuss their issues without assholes ruining it.  However, there are times when safe spaces become intolerant in and of themselves- or at least an ""echo chamber.""  And it's done on both sides.  To put it into perspective, the ""incels"" sub was referred to as a safe space because they wanted to say whatever loony stuff they wanted without anyone disagreeing.  T_D has literally become a safe space- any dissent means you're banned.  The concept can EASILY become ""I just don't want anyone to disagree with me"" or ""Anyone who disagrees with me is evil"" or ""Let's all wallow in our same self-pitying toxic mindset together.""  This happens on both sides of the political spectrum.  And in many places, in a safe space, *I don't really feel safe* because even if I am part of the demographic/struggle, my opinions might not be the same as the ""GROUP OPINION.""  For example, I'm a ""sexual assault survivor"" (hate that term) but my opinions on #metoo would ostracize me in most ""safe spaces for sexual assault survivors.""
* The infantilization.  There is a trend, especially on college campuses, to treat young adults as babies.  Even in some workplaces I've been at, people have been told to ""not discuss stressful work situations"" in front of new college grads.  Safe spaces are very popular on college campuses where it seems young adults are being given disproportionate power but at the same time treated like infants.  I was horrified when a college student screamed, cursed and got in the face of a professor who sent an email she found offensive (I disagreed with the professor's email, but her behavior was truly ridiculous and would have gotten her expelled 10 years ago)  It speaks to a sheltering that *won't* continue in the real world and probably isn't good for them in the long run.  Your school and workplace cannot be safe spaces.  You WILL hear disagreeing or even offensive opinions.  You need to be able to disagree peacefully without melting down or hiding.  It's a basic adult life skill
* And now, trigger warnings (which I consider to be related).  I have an anxiety disorder.  Tons of things ""trigger"" me, but I can't honestly expect everyone to be sensitive to that because how do they even know?!  I'm not triggered by ordinary disturbing things either- something like a siren outside my window can do it.  Obviously, if content is clearly disturbing- rape, self harm, murder, violence, eating disorders- by all means, label it!  But I've seen people demanding ""trigger warnings"" for things that almost nobody in the world would be triggered by (like..images of meat.)  It gets a little outrageous when taken to the extreme and I think it makes a lot of people sour off the concept.  "
"not a meal, but I make stovetop popcorn. Literally just oil and kernels (add salt to taste afterwards).

Everyone who has it (my wife included) thinks it's absolutely amazing...."
"Cacio e Pepe. Three ingredients. Four if you make the pasta by hand. Spaghetti or Fettuccine, next level if you use Bucatini. Cook it al dente minus a few minutes, add a couple tablespoons of oil to a pan with a teaspoon of course ground black pepper (extra points if you just get whole peppercorns and bash/crush them with the back of a pan). Soon as the peppercorns start to bubble in the oil, take the pasta out with tongs and transfer to the oil/pepper pan. Couple ounces of Parmeggiano Reggiano (Grana Padano is fine, Romano is worse) grated through a microplane. Add enough pasta water to make it *just* overly watery. Cook off the water for a minute or so, folding the cheese in and letting it get creamy. Add more pasta water til the sauce is the consistency you like. Takes 8 minutes from start to finish if you use dried/packaged pasta. It's not traditional but while the pastas cooking I usually make a gremolata of anchovies filets, garlic, lemon rind, parsley and maybe some capers, and sprinkle it over the top to finish the sauce. Saved my night so many times when I've stumbled home late and and usually drunk and remember that I didn't eat anything since like noon."
"This is similar to Kardashian hate, I think.

I've literally NEVER seen any news about the Kardashians except on reddit. I don't care about them so I don't follow their stories. Why can't redditors who claim to hate them just also not follow them? "
Sometimes it reminds me of those people who tailgate you on the highway. They're just close enough that you're aware of them (and how dangerous things could be if the situation changes suddenly) but you do your best to act normally and like they aren't there imposing themselves on you.
"Here are the habits that were the most major game-changers for me:

-	Getting out of bed on the first alarm
-	Tidying up the apartment for five to ten minutes before leaving for work each morning
-	Switching to black coffee (nearly eliminated my sugar craving throughout the day for me)
-	Washing my face as soon as I reach home, so I don’t put off my skincare routine
-	Quitting the habit of touching my face unnecessarily (includes picking skin when anxious or stressed — I no longer do this, and it’s made a larger impact on my skin than any other product or habit, such that I no longer break out at all)
-	Creating a sustainable exercise routine, regardless of work schedule
-	Reading every night before bed, for at least 20 minutes (usually an hour)
-	Weekly meal prep
-	HIRING A CLEANING SERVICE FOR MY APARTMENT (OMG HUGE LOAD OF STRESS OFF OF ME WITH THIS ONE)
-	Putting all medical, beauty, and self care reminders on my calendar (eg doing brows every two weeks, trimming nails every week, deep conditioning hair every week, threading facial hair weekly — all things I do myself, but with the cadence noted as appropriate for each thing; anything I don’t do myself, like doctors appointments and massages noted for weekends with automatic recurrences and reminders)
-	Creating reminders a month in advance for important upcoming dates, like birthdays, anniversary/holidays so I have ample prep time 
-	Learning to be as kind and patient toward myself as I am toward my friends and family"
Words are random. They only have meaning because people collectively and abitrarily decide they do. 
"He's a bit of a conversational bull in a China shop.  Like, he starts talking and he just doesn't stop, it's impossible to shift the topic or insert an anecdote or segue to something else.  He just keeps talking... everyone will be done with dinner and his food is cold because he can't stop.  I thought maybe on our first date he was just a nervous talker, but this is how he is.  He probably won't change, and I'm okay with it for the most part, because I can play pokemon while we walk and he talks.

I've become a bit more forceful to engage with him and help others around him jump in and actually have a conversation rather than listen to a lecture."
"People kiss very differently. I've kissed a lot of people and no two were the same. I'd say just take it slow, see how they do things and go with it - how you both kiss affects the kiss overall quite a lot. Don't try to swallow their whole face or ram your tongue down their throat though, no one likes that haha."
"The following is an actual conversation I had a few years ago that was so impressively stupid I will remember it until the day I die.

Him: Why won't you date me?

Me: Because you are constantly trying to figure out ""what women *really* mean"" when they talk instead of accepting what they say at face value.

Him: What the hell is *that* supposed to mean?!

He spent most of the rest of the party talking to other men to try and figure out what I might be trying to manipulate him into doing by saying that. The ones who suggested I meant exactly what I said were dismissed out of hand."
"Misogynistic views about single moms, usually regarding finances. It’s funny because my mother had a career and my stepfather was bankrupt."
"Depression. When you can’t feel anything anymore and don’t give a shit about anything, might as well eat whatever you want and at huge volumes. "
"I’m not sure you can teach someone how to have empathy and to understand why it’s traumatizing if they already don’t get it, honestly."
"I have always hated the *""a man and a woman can never be friends because the romantic attraction will get in the way""* phrase (and the mentality behind it). It's disturbing on several different levels, but I'm always curious what people who go by it think of bisexuals."
"Omfg or that the mere mention of catcalls or harassment or pervy scary messages is 'bragging'.

Fucks sake. It's a disturbing thing that happened to me today is why I said it. People talk about their day, yeah? Normal conversation. This is not me showing off how desirable I think I am. Dew."
"People really do tend to underestimate you in terms of competence and intelligence. I'm conventionally pretty with a very young, bubbly voice - I've just had to figure out how to use being underestimated to my advantage. 

Another thing is that it's all people focus on. It's really easy to let yourself be convinced that's where your value is. "
The decision to get an abortion.
"Yep. My sister, mom and I all woke up around the same time and it was oddly coincidental. None of us knew why. I think it was like 3:00am. We later learned that we all woke up around the time my dad killed himself. It was creepy. "
"Yep. What kills me about it is that I didn't used to be this way. I used to let things roll off me, used to see things more objectively. Then I went through some painful things and instead of becoming harder, it's like I'm still struggling to put my walls back together.

I don't know how to handle it tbh. Sit at home alone and watch movies with my cats, I guess, and try to pull myself out of it. "
"Both yours and the original commenter reminded me of this article that I read. I remember that it said the reason why people say that women talk too much is because of the expectation of women to be silent, passive, and submissive. Therefore when a woman goes against this expectation and makes her voice be heard it's seen as ""talking too much"". It's a form a gender policing to make sure that women confirm to their gender roles which apparently is being quiet."
"Volunteering walking and training shelter dogs. I’ve made some great friends doing it, both human and dog, and I feel happy making a difference to the dogs’ lives. It’s also really fun and enjoyable for me to spend time with the dogs and see their behaviour improve over time. They’re always so excited to go out of the kennel and their joy is infectious. I’m constantly wanting to learn more about force-free dogtraining and how to work with dogs with various behavioural issues. "
"All this.  It's like the concept of ""basic B"".  Like, so what if millions of women enjoy the flavor of pumpkin spice, wearing leggings, driving (super-comfortable and safe) SUVs, wearing (very warm) North Face jackets, wearing furry boots in the winter, star tattoos, etc.

Just because something is liked by a lot of women apparently means it's mockable.  Which is idiotic, sexist, and horribly damaging to our collective female psyche.  

Millions of people, men especially, love freaking football to the point where I'm avoiding leaving my house today because a sporting event is being played in my hometown today.  Football is actively, negatively impacting my life because so many people enjoy it, but somehow it's not BASIC, and we don't get to mock it for being popular, because society associates it with men's enjoyment rather than women's enjoyment."
Well?? Is that how you died? Please update
"I just had this thought today after going on my first date in a long long time (bc i think we're gonna date date): I hope she is *always* a little bit nervous around me. 

My favorite memory of the date was catching her taking tiny little looks at me when she didn't think I would notice. She never met my eyes for long. "
"I don’t understand this. Hell, I can’t even do it one handed and I’m the one who puts it on and takes it off every single day of my life! If I have that kind of experience with a bra clasp and can’t do it, I don’t expect you to.

If you wanna see my boobs, and I want you to see my boobs, the bra is coming off one way or another!"

I'm a slightly obsessive cleaner- having a pool would definitely be stressful for me. I'm also not big enough on leisure swimming to justify having one.
"Well, from my experiences as a bisexual woman who married a man. They tend to just ignore it entirely. 

I've got a few male friends who I've been friends with for ages. My husbands cool with me having friends because he's a reasonable human being. 

However, a few times now my guy friends have talked to me about how their (usually single) female friends believe I'm leading them on (memes and shitposting are apparently the building blocks of seduction now) and that since I'm married I shouldn't be talking to guys at all. 

When they mention that I'm bi, and ask if I just shouldn't have any friends at all. The naysayers proceed to say my female friendships are different. 

Uhh... What? 

Edit: Extra words"

PMS
"I was the only friend she had never hit. She said that to me. It scared the fuck outta me and so I never said or did anything against her until I left highschool. Even her little sister said she was a bad person.

She took advantage of my shy spineless behavior and was a one-upper.

She called me a ""bad dog"" for not stopping completely (I was testing her meanness by taking *baby*-baby steps) while waiting for her to catch up.

Took food from me daily because we ""had an understanding"" (her words). 

Guilted me into giving her $16 by saying *in front of the cashier* that I didn't get her anything for her birthday (she didn't get me anything for mine which came before hers). She gave me the 4 back from the 20 bill I ""gave"" her and said ""see, I'm even nice enough to give you the rest back"" right in front of the cashier. I had traded in a lot of my games so she could buy hers and would pay me back later, and she still did that shit to me. I never got the $25 I was owed for those games.

Also, when we would go to the bathroom she would just wet her hands after coming out of the stall and flick the water on my face as a joke. It was disgusting because it wasnt like she actually washed her hands.

She made me (and most likely others in our group) feel like I was nothing compared to her. I still suffer from it today. It was only 3 or 4 years long, too.

E: reading smolpupper17's post I realize now that a lot of my depression in high school was because of this chick. I still have depression and anxiety, but I'm not suicidal anymore."
"&gt;I have had men tell me I am full of myself, and they were just trying to say hello, not have sex with me. 

I once had a guy who was hitting on me on the bus tell me this after I told him to leave me alone. He went on to try to pick up two other women who told him the same thing. If he really just wanted a friendly conversation or to make a new friend, he would have talked to other men as well, not just attractive young women. Just keep telling yourself that these guys are just trying to pad their bruised egos because they're embarrassed by your rejection. You don't owe them anything and it's perfectly OK to tell them that."
"That women want to cherry pick equality. 

I always see on Reddit men angrily claiming that women should have to choose between having the door held open for them or being a feminist. That women can't be both a feminist and appreciate having her dinner paid for on a date. All I can hear is a man basically admitting that he will only show nice gestures to women if they are inferior/unequal to him.  Like  you can't open the door for her if she believes she is equal to you. If she's so equal she can open her own door. 

The logic of their argument proves the need for feminism. To be fair, I never hear this argument from men IRL, so I think it's that the population of Reddit is definitely biased towards mens-rightsy guys. Still an annoying complaint though. 

Pretty sure no women I know expect doors held open or food to be paid for. And pretty sure most men and women IRL think nothing of opening the door for anyone, man or woman."

"I'm not very pretty.  So they don't see me at all, just look through me like I'm invisible."
"Similarly to this, the failure of a compliment that is ""You're not like other girls.""

"When I'm dating a guy: When I offer to pay either part or the whole bill (and I always do), he *lets* me. 

I won't dump a guy for going ""no, no, I insist"", but it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. If he lets me pay, I feel like it sets a precedent that gender norms are bullshit in this relationship, and that's a good thing. 

Edit: Yes, I know there are many girls who prefer not to pay or only pay when they're not interested, and I understand why guys would try to insist. The question was what makes me *comfortable*, not what my first-date deal-breaker is! I promise, I have considered *all* the reasons and methods of divvying up you guys are saying. "

"I was hoping to see some comments that make me feel amazement...But nope, you just slap me 👋 a depressing fact."
"I get them a lot. I usually pay attention and get out of whatever seems to be causing it. I've ignored the feeling a few times and had unpleasant things happen. 

Most interesting was when I was leaving my house and thought 'I better go get gas before I get to work or something bad will happen.' I didn't, and the first traffic light I hit my car got totalled by someone running a red light at 55 MPH. If I'd been going a little faster I'd be dead now, since they'd have hit my door and smashed me up. They were driving an older car and it was big and heavy and mine was very small and light. 

Other than that I mostly have feelings/impressions that a person I've just met is bad news. It's happened about a half dozen times that I've had confirmation later that they were definitely creepy/unhinged/dangerous so I just listen really hard to those intuitive feelings now when I meet new people. "
"Saying that a woman isn't ""wife material"". Usually, ""wife material"" = cooking, cleaning, laundry, submissiveness, childcare, unreciprocated sexual favors, etc etc. I'm sick of men thinking women have to prove to them that they're worth spending a life with through domestic duties. I want a man who will marry me because he loves me, not because he wants a free maid or a second mother. :) "
"If a dude is frequently broke. My mom always taught me to never spend my last dollar. Everyone goes through hardships and I understand. But I said “frequently” broke. I think every mature responsible adult should learn to save. When I was in a position where I was frequently broke,(when I was younger) I got a second job. I picked up more shifts at my current job. I learned from my mistakes. I did everything I could to not depend on anyone else. I believe other adults should do the same. So I have no compassion towards men who do not learn these healthy financial behaviors by the time they get into their mid twenties."
"**For anyone else who is bad at the metric system:**

This is for approximately 6 pizzas (depending on size): 


8 cups flour 



2 3/4 cups lukewarm water 


2 dry yeast packets


1 teaspoon of salt 


1 teaspoon of (brown) sugar (not a must) 


1-2 tablespoons of olive oil (not a must)




Mix the water with the yeast (and sugar) and let it sit a few minutes. 

In the meantime you mix the flour with salt, then add the water-yeast mix and the oil. 

Mix until you have a nice dough ball. If you find it to dry or liquid then add more water or flour. 

Leave the dough for 30min in a covered bowl (it should double it's size in that time). Then it's ready to spread and put the toppings on. 

Bake it in the oven as hot as you can for 10-15 min but keep an eye on it!

That's basically it. The dough can also be kept for a couple of days in the fridge without going bad.

Enjoy! :)"

"It was an amicable breakup and we now email catch up every few months, but I haven't seen him since. We invested a lot of time in one another so it's nice to learn how the other is turning out. We dated about 8 years ago and he reached out around the 5 year mark.

"My sisters are 13 and 9 years older. They’ve never gotten over how I was the “baby” and “so spoiled”.

In adulthood, they have remained very close - going on sisters cruises and trips together - never inviting me. They don’t even tell me. Occasionally (once ever few years or so), one of them will call and deign interest in my life and profess desire to communicate more. When I reach back out, they’re never available. So I give up and let go of any desire to pursue a stronger sister bond. I deserve better than that. "

"I've also heard guys say this (normally in tech) who never took care of themselves and never developed a personality or social skills but became successful.  If you don't have anything going for you besides money then the only people who want to date you are going to be attracted to your money.

Then I knew I was gonna have to take care of my other tables when I could because they were about to DOMINATE my time. 

Always sprinkled with VERY condescending questions, too. I remember being asked if I had heard of Syria before. Not what I thought of the situation going on there, if I had HEARD of the country before, and was very impressed that I had. 

I also learned that saying I had never heard of such and such comic book, video game, anime whatever warranted a half hour explanation of it. A couple times I tried to rope my co worker who was into that specific show or comic book into the conversation, but he was male, and suddenly my customer isn't as interested in the conversation any more?? Huh weird. It was so tiring because, like you said, I have other customers. And also, it was always so obvious they didn't want to have a mutual conversation (or I assume my co worker would have sufficed much better than I do), they just wanted to monologue at a girl who can't walk away and come off as some sort of intellectual. 

edit: I actually have a kind of hilariously relevant story that I just remembered. Semi often tables will ask to pay for another table's check in a sort of pay it forward way or something. I had a really nice young couple tell me they just got some really good news and were feeling generous and asked if I could just ring my next table up on their check so the meal was on them. 

I told them sure and then my next table is two nerdier looking guys and they're sat in the booth right next to nice couple and they were doing ""the thing."" Asking me if I had heard of this or that movie and then lecturing me on it, literally just reading the news to me and telling me what they thought, being super condescending but also flirty and uncomfortable. Like how guys with zero social skills imagine ""Studs"" talk to waitresses but really don't. Anyway they finally ask me how old I am and I say ""18, I'm a senior in high school blah blah blah"" and they make some weird comments about ""uh oh barely legal"" ""high school oh man I thought you were older"" just basically EW. I step to the table with the nice couple and they're cracking up and giving ""I'm so sorry"" eyes and say they don't want to pay for that table they'll wait for another one hahaha. They creeped their way out of a free meal."

"Oh man that guy was the worst. She regularly points out to him that if she works there for a little while, it's gonna look fuckin' great on her CV/resume and she'll have much better chances of working somewhere she actually wants to in the future.

"This is because men are judged by a plethora of traits while women are mainly judged by ""young, fertile, attractive.""

I've had sexual issues for a long time, probably since the first time I've had sex, and it's caused a huge lack of sex in my current relationship. We've been together 4 years, going on 5, and since we're planning on spending our lives together, we decided to see a sex therapist.

If this relationship is one you're invested in, do try to find a sex therapist. If not, then have a heart to heart and see if a talk can solve anything."

"Only once. 
When I was 16 I was invited to a bonfire. I thought about sneaking out of the house (I was staying with my disabled grandmother so my Mom, her caretaker, could get a break) because I knew my G-ma would be fine. I really wanted to go but just got this odd feeling that i'd better not go, so I didn't. 

That night, my friend at the bonfire had a freak accident and ended up covered in 3rd degree burns over his entire body. He passed away about a month later. 

All I could think is how fucked it would be have been to have been there and witness that. I heard from others who were and i'm not sure they'll ever be the same. "
"My brother and I don't talk.  We're in our 30s, 3 years apart, and live in the same country.  So we could talk, but we don't.  We don't dislike each other (I don't dislike him and I don't think he dislikes me?) but we just don't talk.  I don't think it really bothers me.  I don't think it really bothers him.

When we're visiting our dad together we still talk and bicker like we just saw each other yesterday.  I don't feel any level of awkwardness that we didn't talk in the half year - year prior.

I think it bugged my mom that we don't talk, though, I think she had a vision we'd be friends or close family as adults."
"One of my exes, my first love and and I was his first love, reached out to me to get my blessing. He was going to propose to a girl and asked me if I am okay with that. His reasoning was that he and I were together for so long that I molded him to be the man that he is today. He hasn't been this excited about a woman since me and wanted my approval. The way he gushed about her made me incredibly happy. I told him to go for it because he deserves to be happy and loved. It took me by surprise that he reached out to me like that because he definitely doesn't need my approval since we are no longer close and he lives a thousand miles away. It was really sweet. 

I keep in touch with all my exes. My thing is unless they fucked you over pretty badly, there is no reason to burn bridges. This is a person who was a big part of your life, molded you to be who you are today. Why be upset and bitter just because someone realizes that it won't work out? They are probably doing you a favor. It's not like they fucked your best friend. My friends think I am weird. At this age, we are all adults and we have mature relationships. Accept the fact that sometimes people do not work out. Shit happens. "
"I think the ability to delay gratification is the big one.  He could eat fast food every night, or do a little work and make healthy meals at home.  He can stay up playing video games all night, or he can get some sleep and be productive at work.  He could veg in front of the tv after dinner, or he could wash up the dinner dishes first.  He could buy $5 lattes, drinks, lunches out, the latest phone, the latest games, and whatever gizmos so long as he still has money, or he could save up for a rainy day, set money aside for big purchases and retirement, and live within his means.  He could ask out the hot girl at the gym, or remain faithful to his girlfriend.  He has taken the time to read, to travel, to learn a couple hobbies, and has an appreciation for the world around him.  

He may love his sports team, but he isn’t a “homer” and is gracious in defeat.

He lives in a home, with curtains and furniture, not a bachelor crash pad that smells like a garbage dump."
"Am I the only one who would be a bit weirded out if I found out my fiancee had asked an ex basically for permission to propose to me? I'm all for being civil with exes, but I don't think they have any say or place in someone's new relationship. Exes are exes for a reason, even if there was no abuse or toxic behaviour in the relationship. I think it's a red flag if your fiancee had an ex on their mind when considering proposing to you. "

"At the end of a night of drinking with friends, we stopped at a food truck to get some hot dogs. Mine had mac and cheese on it. I took one bite and then some guy came out of nowhere and knocked it out of my hand on purpose. He tried stealing my credit card after that, and then decided to hit on me. He was very much in my personal space and I made it clear his advances were not welcome. He wouldn't leave me alone.

So I punched him in the face. "

"Let's do some basic estimation.

* The radius of the Earth is 6,371km, so it has a surface area of 5.112 * 10^8 square km.

* 71% of the Earth is covered by water, so we're left with 1.482 * 10^8 square km.

* Obviously, not all of the Earth's land is covered by trees. Let's say that 10% is. It doesn't really matter, we're estimating.

* We're left with 1.482 * 10^7 square km covered in trees.

* Typically, there are about 100,000 trees per square km, getting us about 1.4 trillion trees in the world.

* There are about 250 billion stars in the Milky Way.

After doing this, I Googled ""number of trees in the world,"" and they're saying 3 trillion. So my estimation wasn't too bad. Either way, there are definitely more trees than stars in the Milky Way."

"Brazil nuts.


At some point in my teens, I decided I wanted to start eating healthier. I was already a pretty slim person and a vegan, but I have a *bad* sweet tooth. So I started cutting out sugary desserts, substituting with nuts and fruit.


After a few months of this, I realized that I wasn't feeling very well, *and* I was actually gaining weight -- about 10 pounds total, which looks obvious on a short, skinny 16 year old. The reason? I was eating a serving of fruit and a *handful* of Brazil nuts for dessert, every single night. There are about 200 calories per 6 Brazil nuts, and some larger Brazil nuts can have almost 70 calories each. Brazil nuts are also super high in selenium, and eating more than 6-9 nuts per day can give you selenium poisoning. I was eating probably 20 nuts a day -- about 700 calories, and over 3x the max amount of selenium you should consume per day.


So yeah, trying to cut down my sweet tooth and eat healthy ended up making me gain weight and contract mild selenium poisoning."
"I’ve gotten into so many bizarre debates about the Kardashians. I’ve never seen their show and I’m not interested in them, but the amount of sheer vitriol for them is fairly telling, to me. 

The debate always starts with someone, usually a man (though not always), ranting about how they’re “trashy” and “contribute nothing to society.” 

I always point out: how do they contribute less than any other entertainer — actor, pro wrestler, etc.? 

“Because they’re not entertainers! I don’t find them entertaining at all!”

Well, they have a show that millions of people *choose to watch* because they find it entertaining, and a media empire of people who *choose to follow them* because they’re entertained. 

“BUT THEY’RE GARBAGE!” 

And soforth. The Kardashians are entertainers. Using a different model than the average actor, but it’s effectively the same line of work. They developed an entertainment product that tons of people wanted to consume. 

Yet the amount of hate and loathing to them is so intense, and so laden with misogyny. "

"I was 18. He’d sexually assaulted my best friend while she was sleeping; she woke up in the middle and had no idea what to do, so she just lay there.

"I have a few people in my life who I do the bulk of my complaining to, and who complain to me in turn. Everyone needs to vent, and it can be very constructive and satisfying to vent your frustrations in a healthy way to a person who will listen. I find that that alone helps me avoid complaining.

Additionally, I just try to be more conscious of what I’m saying. It takes a lot of practice to change your conversation habits, especially if they’re largely negative, so aim for small changes. Go into conversations with a few positive things you want to talk about, regardless of how small they are. I almost always have 2-3 big things I could complain about at the end of a long work day, but it’s a bit harder to remember to share the funny joke I heard or a good conversation I had with a coworker.

Finally, I try to never complain about the same thing twice. It’s totally normal to have frustrations and complaints, but it gets old to hear someone complain about the same thing again and again."

"YES!! And funny enough, wasn't even supposed to be a bridesmaid originally.

My sister in law is super sweet, smart, and very trendy. She picked out these GORGEOUS designer dresses for her very small group of bridesmaids. Soft color, high-low skirt, flattering strapless with a sweetheart neckline. Kind of faerie like. 

Her maid of honor got pregnant with her 2rd child and started to show WAY faster than expected. She was miserable and couldn't fit in the dress a good 2 months before the wedding. Then she started having some pains and trouble with the pregnancy and wasn't sure she'd even make it to the big day. (She did and was fine, the kiddo is 6 now!) Eventually, somehow the subject came up that she would sell the dress if my SIL had another friend who could step in. She asked me and I accepted, so excited to join!

I'm reading others stating that they still love their partner just as much as though that goes away after the phase passes. That was never my understanding of it. A good relationship is always exciting and warm. The end of the honeymoon phase to me signifies when you become 100% aware of who they are as a person and get a front row seat to their worst. You still love them with all the exuberance of the first few weeks, but you've now seen all the things like their face tight with nonsensical irritation over the way their brother holds a fork. It's not that the filter is gone, it's that you've just been there to see all of their human flaws. "

"The US military, as part of an effort to study and defend against (and, let's be real, to use) bioterrorism, once dispersed a non-infectious species of bacteria into the San Francisco smog just to see where it would go, how far it could travel, etc. 

Well, they *thought* it wasn't infectious. The species they chose was Serratia marcescens, which is now circulated among humans as an increasingly common cause of pneumonia and life-threatening hospital-associated infections. It's also particularly prone to developing antibiotic resistance, which has become a major problem."
"Things happened when I graduated high school that made it impossible to go directly to college. I worked retail selling cell phones for years then got a job as an admin assistant but never felt secure in my career. I tend to move states every few years and felt like it would be less stressful if I had a career rather than a job. I also got pregnant at 26 and realized I couldn't support a child myself. After a very traumatic pregnancy loss, I went back at 28 and graduated at 32. I wanted to go for accounting initially but ended up landing in statistics. Now I'm a database administrator/data analyst and love my job. I also make enough to support myself, my husband, and the kid we're trying to have. Most importantly, I feel like I could get a new job immediately anywhere I wanted if it came to it.

My only advice is to take advantage of all resources. Office hours are gold and most schools have some sort of returning adults program. It's easy to get complacent then suddenly realize you're having to rush to catch up if you're not used to studying from the start and those things help keep you on top of things."
"When I was 5, my family rented a beach house for the holidays (it's summer here). Santa brought me the most wonderful plastic wagon filled with toys for playing in the sand, like pails, spades, colorful molds, it was awesome. My sister was 10, and she got a pair of rollerblades.

Well, the holidays had to end some time, and we went back to the city. We got home and my sister went on to play with her rollerblades... and where was my wagon? My mom assumed I wouldn't have any sand to play with at home, so she just gave it away to the neighbor's kids before we left the beacj. She *gave my christmas gift away*. I was devastated. My aunt took me out and got me a pair of rollerblades just like my sister's, but it couldn't leave the hole my wagon left behind.

As much as I love dancing, I like financial security and the disposable income to live a good life even more."
"I have two of my own, imma roast myself for a minute. 

A few years ago I was offered an internship at Apple while in college. Like one of those internships that they only take 5-10% of a bunch of applicants and it paid really well. I worked hard to get that interview and the offer. Why did I turn it down? It was full time and early mornings and I wanted to spend time with my boyfriend at the time -_-

The second one, was a little over a year ago. I was about to graduate college and was in a different relationship than the one mentioned before. I am 100% against long distance relationships due to personal experiences and my bf at the time was a semester behind me to graduate. The first mistake was even though I had dreamed and been planning on moving out of state after graduation, I obviously didn’t want to put that strain on the relationship or break up. So I ended up staying in state. But wait, there’s more! 
Right after I decided I was going to stay in the college town to be near my boyfriend instead of 100 miles away in the city I would prefer (but still could’ve backed out, I wasn’t tied down to staying there at this point) I got TWO dream job offers. 1 was at my favorite non profit which I had done an internship at and wanted to work there forever. 2 was to teach at a charter school, I didn’t have my cert or a major in education but I secretly wanted to teach. Due to my connection at both I was told there was an opening at each that was mine if I wanted it. I turned down both to stay with him in the college town and got a job there. 
He dumped me before my job even started post graduation. I had turned down two dreams jobs which now neither position was open and signed a lease in a town I hated. 

I would never do anything like that again and I know I was foolish. The first guy was controlling and I felt like I needed to spend time with him. But the second one I just was really in love with and thought we wanted the same things.

"One of my cats is a lil shit head. He gets overstimulated very easily and a cuddle session can quickly turn to a ""bite the shit out of my human"" session. He likes to scratch the bed or chew electrical wires when he's hungry or wants attention. He climbs places he shouldn't. Total brat. 

But when I lay on the couch he comes running over to me and flops on my chest/face, purrs, rubs his face against my face and gives me kisses all over. Then he'll fall asleep on me. :D"

We really don't know how to prevent it, we're not even clear on what the risk factors are, since those risk factors are so generic and the cause of just about everything else bad in pregnancy that just about every woman has a few of them."

When men cheat, they are only trying to get sex and they will go back to being ""loyal"" to their significant other. People were actually defending this argument... Men saying that women are way more unfaithful than men really tick me off. Cheating is cheating period and I was saddened to see people disagreeing with that... As if men can't fall in love with another women and cheat on their significant other. Please. The stereotype that all women cheat is quite ridiculous. "
"&gt; gather he wasn't exactly healthy either.

He wasn't..he had horrible back issues and suffered from [Addison's disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/addisons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350293). The only reason he was able to get into the military at all was because his father bribed them to let him in. He had a LOT of faults, yes..including being a cheating womanizer but that's because that's how he was brought up. Catholic or not, he was taught that was totally OK and just went with it because it suited him. How Jackie put up with it (because there was NO way she didn't know) is beyond me. But again..Catholic. And back then, a good Catholic just didn't get divorced.

I think he had good ideas and wanted to make this country a better place, despite all his faults. Would he have gotten us entangled in Viet Nam? I don't know. I'd like to think not or maybe not to the degree that Johnson did. We'll never know how this country would've been if he and his brother Robert had lived, because his brother was very similar in his goals and ideals (I feel). It would've been incredibly interesting had they lived, to see how they would've done things, how they would've changed this country.

I like to think that had they lived, had things been different, we wouldn't have The Big Cheeto in office now. Maybe we would, I don't know. But I like to believe maybe..probably..not."

"I'm one of those. I'm still incredibly bitter about this incident:

In kindergarten, at the start of each week our teacher would choose a ""Star of the Week"" and everyone in the class would participate in special projects about this classmate (things like ""interviewing"" the star and asking what their favorite things were). 

Every week, I waited for my turn to be the star. I was so excited! The teacher would reveal the name of the star by lifting a large sheet of paper over a poster. 

One day, she lifts the paper....... And there's my name!! Wait - why is there a line drawn down the center of the paper? Why is my name written twice, once on each side?

What the teacher did was instead of dedicating a whole week to me, like she did with all the other students, she split the week between me and the other girl with the same name in our class. I was SO FUCKING PISSED. I want to be the only motherfucking star of the week! Why should I have to share it just because our names are the same?! "

"* The ""wanderlust"" trend. Sure, it has its share of pretentious people. But at its roots, what a cool trend! Millenials have made it cool for people to be in the great outdoors and visiting their local and national parks. Even with its annoyances, I can't hate on that.

* The fitness/gym rat trend. Similar to wanderlust, it has its fair share of people who exploit it on social media in annoying ways. But mostly, I think it is a positive trend. We've made it cool and more accessible for people of all body types to work on health. To celebrate going to the gym without being told that gaining muscle isn't ""ladylike."" To be proud to eat a healthy, balanced diet instead of going on some weird ""cabbage and coffee"" diet that those women's magazines championed back in the day. And most importantly, to embrace the flaws of the journey there. We've made it more okay for women of all body types to be open about their ""problem areas"", stretch marks, cellulite, etc. Nothing wrong with that!"
"I've met a few and theres two kinds - the shy ones and the out going ones.

It all seems very forced, creepy because no personal boundaries and they can't take a hint. 


The shy type avoid eye contact, make crude jokes, balantly perve, but often are too scared to say anything until theyre behind a computer screen and that's where all the creepy sex stuff pours out "

"This is for approximately 6 pizzas (depending on size):
1kg flour
650ml lukewarm water
2 dry yeast sachets
1 teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon of (brown) sugar (not a must)
1-2 tablespoons of olive oil (not a must)

Mix the water with the yeast (and sugar) and let it sit a few minutes. In the meantime you mix the flour with salt, then add the water-yeast mix (and the oil). Mix until you have a nice dough ball. If you find it to dry or liquid then add more water or flour. 
Leave the dough for 30min in a covered bowl (it should double it's size in that time). Then it's ready to spread and put the toppings on. 
Bake it in the oven as hot as you can for 10-15 min but keep an eye on it! 

That's basically it. The dough can also be kept for a couple of days in the fridge without going bad. 

Enjoy! :) "

"I'm also in that middle ground and I get shit from both sides!

A lot of people create a false dichotomy between ""hookup culture"" and ""waiting for marriage"" as if there is no middle ground.

My ethnicity is Indian/South Asian, and in general, the Indian community maintains a similar false dichotomy between ""evil American hookup culture"" and ""pure Indian arranged marriage"" (I live in the US). More traditional Indians assume I'm a ""whore"" because I'm not having an arranged marriage. Clearly, if I'm not waiting to marry and have sex with someone I barely know, I must be fucking everything that moves. /s *sigh*"

"Just to spoil this so it doesn't scare anyone, nothing actually happened to me that was bad.  I've had this feeling a bunch in life, but the strongest I've ever had this feeling, I was about 20, long-distance driving on I-80 through PA near dark, and there was a gas station and a sign that said something like ""last gas x miles"".  So I decided to pull over to fill up because I had about half a tank.

I got into the gas station and there's just me there and the guy inside the station, looking at me through the window of the gas station.

I looked back at him through my windshield and made eye contact before pulling up to a pump and got this weird feeling of dread.  I have no idea why.  He was just some middle aged dude looking at me, he wasn't particularly doing anything weird, just staring at a car pulling into his gas station, but there was absolutely no one around, no other cars on the surface street, no one in the gas station, nothing around the gas station.  Just me and this dude, the sound of cars speeding by on the highway half a mile away, and nothing.

So, I stopped the car and I'm just sitting there facing the building looking at this dude.  Sat there about a minute.  Then decided I just can't do this, even though I don't know why.  Turned around and left the gas station.  Proceeded to wonder what the hell just happened for the rest of the drive.  I had barely enough gas to get to the next exit with a gas station, but that was more populated and I had no issues.

Best case scenario I guess, I really confused that gas station attendant a lot.  Some lady pulls in, looks all around the area, faces the building and stares at him for a few minutes, then leaves.  lol."

I tried that for my wedding: my now SIL is the ONLY ONE who followed directions. My sister (the MOH) showed up with no dress - I had to rush her to a store to find one  the day before the wedding. My other SIL had a beautiful dress but my MIL told her she looked like a whore so she ended up wearing an ugly..thing. The junior bridesmaid's mother had her wear a dirty bra under HER dress so my aunt rushed her to Target to get a strapless bra an hour before the wedding.  It was a shitshow and I've never trusted any of them (except now SIL) to do anything. At all. Ever.
"Constant sexual objectification. When men are kind to you, it's hard to tell if it's because they like you or just the way you look. You'll find it's the latter more often than the former. Men will often pretend to care about you just so they can have a shot at fucking you, then disappear once they either get their notch or realize it's not in the cards. Male friends often have ulterior motives, and sometimes you don't learn this until after you've grown to trust them. 

Generally lots of unwanted romantic and sexual attention, and you're always caught between the rock and hard place of ""give him a chance""/""don't friendzone him"" and ""don't be a slut""/""have some self-respect."" You'll have to reject people a lot. And sometimes, you'll be made to feel *really* guilty about it.

On this note, people will feel it's okay to invade your space. You'll be minding your own business just reading the news on your phone while riding the bus, drinking a coffee at Starbucks or eating a burrito at Chipotle, even jamming out with headphones on, and men you don't know will fumble to start conversations or come over and ask to sit with you. This will happen often enough to make you a little on-edge whenever you're out in public. People will seek you out, whether you want them to or not. It can be hard to get a moment to yourself. 

Being sexually harassed will make you feel unsafe and small, but on top of that, you'll feel guilty for feeling bad about it in the first place. *What are you complaining about? At least men want you.*

You'll find it much harder to make female friends than male friends. Women just won't like you unless you're over-the-top accommodating and friendly. Female friends will sometimes get resentful and blame you when the men they like are more interested in you than them, even when you want nothing to do with the men in question. You'll lose friends over other people's feelings and romantic inclinations.

Men will initially be enthusiastic about courting/dating/being seen with you in public, but will lose interest once they realize you're a person who has feelings and needs that won't always be convenient for them. Many men will think they're in love with you but then change their minds upon really getting to know you. Expressing and asserting your needs will begin to make you panic. You'll feel guilty about not actually having the qualities men have projected onto you, or even inadequate and worthless as a person.

Men will often try to force relationships with you when the compatibility and chemistry are clearly not there just because they like how you look. 

The concept of growing old and losing your looks will terrify you, because you find yourself wondering if anyone would actually care about you if you weren't beautiful. 

If you have an SO, you’ll wonder occasionally whether they would have fallen in love with you in the first place if you were homely. You’ll know the answer is probably no. You’ll struggle to reconcile this, all while feeling ashamed of having a hard time with something so many women literally die trying to achieve. 

Accomplishments are always dampened by the fact that you can never truly know how much of them came from merit and how much of them came from you ""skating by on your looks.""

People focus on your looks so much that you may begin to wonder if you have any redeeming qualities at all besides being beautiful, or if the other good qualities you do have even matter to anyone else."

That “what women want” is some kind of enduring mystery.
"Selfies.  I feel strongly about this even though I take no selfies since my phone is old and crap. 

My theory is that selfies signify a re-organization of society.  Back in the day, the only people who would have their image captured, either in sculpture or picture, would be ""high-ranking"" people like religious figures, royals, etc.   I've read that our brains understand that seeing an image of someone consistently means that that person is important.  And if you go to places like the UK, the Queen's face is fucking everywhere, for that reason.  

Now, you have people, who are taking pictures of themselves and posting them on social media.  It's basically a way of asserting that they are important.    And why would you give a toss about what a pope or a king says, if the most important person  in your life is you?  

This is a great loss of power for high-ranking people.  I think it's why a lot of authority figures hate selfies.   

Also, selfie culture is very much oriented around beauty and a lot of ""important"" people are fugly.  And for minorities, it's the great chance of seeing people who look like you in media.  If you are a black girl in a hijab, you probably never see yourself on TV.  But on IG, there are lots of women who fit that profile, who are taking selfies and sharing their lives.  

I think it's great.  

*TL;DR: Selifes allow people to think about themselves more, and that's a good thing*

* Pop music. Especially in a day and age where almost all genres of music are just as heavily manufactured. It's just meant to sound catchy, it's not like Katy Perry thinks she's the next Bach. Also, people act like having songs written for you is bad. Why should we exclude songwriters who can't/don't perform and performers who can't/don't write? 
* Social media influencers. There are some legitimate points to be made about deceptiveness in advertising (i.e., photoshopping yourself to be thicc and then claiming these vitamins helped you lose belly fat, etc.). Even so, it seems like most people who complain just want to talk about how these girls are so full of themselves/everyone thinks they're a model/whatnot.
* In line with what everyone's saying about ""things women like,"" I see soooo much hatred for ""mom"" things on Reddit. Can't have an honest discussion about Facebook without without mentioning how much they hate kid updates/wine posts/coffee posts. Can't see a dating profile post without someone accusing a single mom of ""just wanting someone to parent her children."" Stay at home moms are, according to these people, fools who really think they're putting in just as much hard work as the Working Men of Reddit (who constantly joke about browsing Reddit at work) but stay at home dads should be normalized and respected. ""Wine moms"" are annoying and unoriginal, ""beer dads"" are funny and charming. I tend to think of Reddit as a place that's... generally accepting of women but it's really alarming to see the casual/frequent anger directed towards mothers/married women/women above like 35."

"And if he couldn't? If the other person was bigger, or stronger? 

It isn't just about the physical violation. It's about being made helpless, vulnerable, subject to another person's desire. It's terrifying to be that helpless, to know you cannot protect yourself, to realize someone can violate your body and there's nothing you can do. 

It isn't just the physical violation that's traumatizing. It's what that violation means. At it's core, sexual assault is about control and dominance over an unwilling party. It leads to the sudden realization: *you only have autonomy if others allow you that autonomy.* Being helpless and under the control of someone who denies your autonomy? That's the scary part, because it strips you down to your most vulnerable self to realize what you want doesn't matter when horrible things are being done to you.

I was sexually abused as a child. There was no physical trauma, but it warped my view of men and what sex was for a decade afterwards. It destroyed my faith in people, made me think men were all monsters, and taught me to hide behind defensive measures so I'd never be helpless again. There is so much more to sexual assault than just the physical aspect - it is an attack on your mind as much as on your body.

"I'm older, so I think overall the biggest negative is that it's so temporary.  Maybe 1/4 of a normal-length life in the best case.

Let's say, probably not.  Well, now you ARE average, and you have kids, and maybe (s)he seems indifferent sometimes, and what are you supposed to do about it?

But he is also a huuuuge cuddler. He is like my shadow, always following me around even if I'm just going across the room and back. When I'm on the couch or in bed he wants to be right on top of me, snoring in my face. It's the sweetest thing ever!

He entered the funeral home quickly, gave me a hug and told me he couldn’t stay. In all the moments I could’ve needed him to be there, this was it. He refused. Later that night he called me crying. He confessed that he cheated on me...the day of my mother’s funeral. I couldn’t do it anymore.

He called me everyday. He sent me messages every time I got online. Eventually it tapered off and I stopped hearing from him. I met someone new and I was head over heels. About a year into a relationship with a new guy (my now husband) he sent me a message on MySpace (LOL) asking why we can’t be friends, that he doesn’t want to be with me anymore, he’s in a relationship and he’s happy. Even suggesting he and my DH should be friends... wut. 

I ignored it. About once a year for over 7 years he’d randomly pop up and try to reconnect on social media. At some point he realized I had a son. He messaged me to tell me we should be friends, we’re both married and have a child. I’ve never entertained it or even responded. I’d block him and move on. Eventually the messages stopped but every now and then he tries to add me on Facebook. 


TLDR; yes. I ignored him every time. There is no relationship. "
"&gt; I don't feel like I deal with sexism in at work.

You're lucky.  I'm also in a STEM field and I get to deal with gender bullshit and sexism all the time.  I'm seriously thinking of dropping science and going into another field altogether."
"While doing my OB rotation I worked in triage. Every woman who came in was separated from everyone and asked about abuse and medical history privacy. It didn’t matter if they came in with their husband, child, or mother.

Also, I learned that statistically it takes asking a person six times if they have/are being abused before they will admit it. It’s the average. "
"In an education program I was in a couple of years ago I was at a weekend event and was just making conversation.  I asked this one guy about his plans with the program just to be nice and he leads with “I’m married”.  It was weird, I wasn’t hitting on him I was conversing, something adults in professional situations do.  It wasn’t a response I heard him give to other women.  So sometimes I find being decently attractive it is hard to just casually converse with men without there being more to it somehow."
"I don't like the extremely streamlined minimalist style.  Like, your living room shouldn't look like a sterile surgical suite."
"When I was 7-8 I was super obsessed with cats. Wanted to have a cat, be a cat, draw cats, wear cat sweaters, whatever. I spent some free time raising money to donate food to the local shelter and volunteered socializing them (aka, they let me spend time petting floofs since I was too young to really help much otherwise).

One day, after growing attached to one particular young cat, my mom announced that I could take it home. 

That cat was my BFF, slept with me at night, greeted me at the door when I got home, put up with my antics. Didn't mess with my birds. Overall great cat...

Until one day, maybe 6 months to a year later, my mom told me that the cat was sick and we couldn't keep her and we had to let her go. By 'let her go' she meant load me, my sister, my sister's random friend who was spending the night, and my cat into the car and drive to a field on the outskirts of town and then have me walk my cat into the field and leave her there. The cat followed me back to the car, so I had to pick her up and take her back into the field and then run back to the car and get in before she could catch up to me.

That weekend my mom dropped my sister and I off at her friend's house and drove to Canada to take herself on vacation. I spent the entire two weeks I was there crying about my abandoned cat.

Almost 25 years later and I can still picture her poor confused face as she ran behind me. Aaannnnd I do not talk to my mother.

Edit: I am imagining that every single one of these upvotes is a giant middle finger directed toward my mother."
