"I only have sex with someone I trust enough to consider my boyfriend, so it‚Äôs going to take a few months for whomever I‚Äôm dating to see me naked. 

This isn‚Äôt as difficult as people tend to think it is. 

Let me make clear that I never announce to the guy that he‚Äôll be waiting at least a month or two for sex. My personal timeline is none of his business. I simply don‚Äôt create the opportunity for something to happen if I‚Äôm not ready to.

I‚Äôm never over at his place late at night, and he‚Äôs never at mine. When he drops me off after a date, I‚Äôll give him a hug and a kiss in the hallway; he‚Äôs not coming in.

Most guys are OK with this, as long as they feel they‚Äôre not wasting their time. We have great dates, we kiss. I let him know that he‚Äôs desirable to me, and that my choosing to wait is not an indication that I‚Äôm not interested.

If I have a date with one of those guys who insists on sex within a week or two of knowing me, I let him walk, because he‚Äôs up against someone who‚Äôs not afraid to be single. I‚Äôm holding out for someone I‚Äôm compatible with, and a man who has indiscriminate sex isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm looking for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Oh. Oh I got this.

She wanted to have two bachelorette parties, both of which involved flying, Airbnbs, etc. The first (Nashville) I was excited about and had been in the works for some time. Why the second? Oh, well, it was a re-do because she had a horrible time at the first! She cried and missed her fiance the whole time; decided she hated country music and therefore Nashville; was upset that it snowed in Nashville when she thought it was swimsuit weather; and finally sobbed and laid down in the middle of the street after finding out while we were in Nashville, her fiance, my then-boyfriend, and the other guys went to a casino for the weekend. This meant that he was having two bachelor parties now, and this somehow made Nashville not a ""true"" bachelorette weekend (not sure that logic tracks) so we needed to plan her another one.

At first I felt bad, because she was so anxious and so stressed and no one likes feeling that way when traveling. So we plan a second bachelorette weekend, this time to Chicago a month later, where one of the bridesmaids lives. All excited, I love Chicago. We get there ... and she spends the whole time crying and missing her fiance; deciding she hates snow and therefore Chicago; and finally sobbing and laying down in the middle of the street because no one told our waiter it was her special weekend. 

Yay. 

Edited to add: I forgot this detail. One of the other girls locked the two of us in the bathroom by accident because she slammed the door too hard, and we had to call our Airbnb owner to come rescue us. We were stuck in there for so long, we had to poop in front of each other. I did not know her at the time."
We do have coming-of-age experiences that don‚Äôt center around specifically feminine things.
"dresses are the craziest hack. you don't have to match jack shit, it's all one piece, and people lose their minds over how put together you look. i bought a bunch of cheap cotton skater dresses when they were in fashion and they're so easily dressed up, too."
"Can't sleep at night, want to sleep all day and take super long naps.

On a similar note, alternating wildly between no appetite and eating everything in sight at different times of the day.

Randomly biting people's heads off.

Clenching my jaw to the point it gets sore or I get headaches."
"I've noticed in Dean Koontz' writing that most of his female leads seems to only eat egg white omelets, light salads, or bread and fancy cheese.

He even wrote one female lead who would always enjoy her bubble bath with a glass of good champagne and a *single* piece of **dark** chocolate. Like... I'd take the entire slab of chocolate. "
"I think the lack of credibility that many of us females experience. I've had so many males treat me like they know so much more about a topic than me because I somehow cannot know what I'm talking about. For a recent example I am currently trying to sell my motorcycle, a guy tried telling me I know nothing about my bike (was comparing it and kept referring to a completely different model of bike) and telling me I know nothing about motorcycles, let's just ignore that I used to sell motorcycles for quite a few years. 

Edited to add: I just want to clarify that I know this happens to men too. I just don't think they get to experience this to the same degree as women do. Generally for a guy it's highly situation based, while most females tend to find this with many of their interactions with males."
"My SIL was upset I would be the only family member with dark hair (I dyed it black at the time) and so my Mother paid for my hair to be bleached twice to get it blonde to match the rest of my family members. Both families are blondes so she didnt want dark hair pulling focus. A week before the wedding the MOB died her hair dark brown. Bride was choked. 

I died my hair back to black a week after the wedding. SIL didn't come to my wedding. 

Not surprised. "
" I don‚Äôt know if this qualifies but for a wedding I‚Äôm in this summer the bride wanted to have that whole mismatched bridesmaid dress aesthetic *without* giving the bridesmaids (there‚Äôs 7 of us) the option of actually choosing our own dresses.  So what she did was choose seven dresses, send a photo collage of the dresses in a group chat, and have us duke it out via text as to who would get what dress.  It was so awkward and hostile.  I only know a few of the other bridesmaids, and I had no interest in arguing with strangers over text as to what dress I was going to wear.  So I just kept quiet and took whatever was assigned to me.  

Luckily I like the dress I got, but the whole thing was like a bizarre social experiment gone wrong."
"Positive note: really supportive female friendships. I know that this isn't a universal experience for women, and I know that it's not something men everywhere are excluded from, but it's a stereotype for a reason! Just having one or two friends that they are close enough to that it's basically a platonic romantic relationship. I really feel for people (but especially dudes, since it is apparently more likely for them to miss out on this kind of friendship) who don't have them."
"We hyphenated. We decided whose name went first by which sounded better. One way rolled off the tongue much easier so that's what we stuck with. We toyed with doing some unique combination for our names but one combination sounded like a Dr. Seuss creature and the other most obvious combination was Cunter.

""Hi, we're your new lesbian neighbors, the Cunter's.""

Yeah... not gonna happen.
"
"I was the maid of honor and the bride called me telling me she wanted me to throw her a party in Vegas. I told her I couldn't afford it. She pressured me for a long time about it. Then I threw her a pretty great party in a nice big city closer to our hometown and spent hundreds of dollars and she sighed and said, ""yeah this was pretty good, but I wish it was Vegas."" 

Edit: I lost about 10 pounds from stress that year. People asked me if I had a disease or what was wrong. In the pictures, the size 0 dress from David's Bridal is just about falling off my skeletal frame.

Now I'm working on how to say no to toxic people. What shocked me about her request for Vegas was a year earlier her friend made her go to a bachelorette party in Vegas and that bride was a bridezilla who put everyone through hell. My friend had to spend like $3000 dollar for a luxury penthouse hotel and pay $20 covers to go to clubs where if you asked for a water they sold you a $30 bottle of designer water. It sounded like hell. She would call and complain to me about it during this time. Lo and behold a year later she gets engaged and calls me and asks me point blank to throw her party in Vegas. She was in my wedding a few years earlier and I was the most thoughtful and accommodating bride. I let my bridesmaids pick their dresses from the cheapest selection and never asked a thing from them. Now I just feel nothing toward her."
"Having someone old enough to be your parent or grandparent, who is also significantly larger/faster/stronger than you, who is also far more likely to be believed by police/security/etc., approach in a highly sexually aggressive manner while your a child.  Men think cat calling is when an age appropriate guy says something vaguely complimentary and non-threatening to a grown woman on the street.  However, most women first experience cat calls/being hit on by strangers/etc when they're between the ages of 9-12, the strangers in question are usually full grown adult males, and the things they say are definitely threatening.  I don't really wish the experience on anyone exactly, but I don't think the average man really understands how terrifying it is.       "
Male writers never include the drunk bathroom dynamic of making instant best friends.
That we are really aware of our boobs.  All the time.
"I did online dating as a person not into casual sex. I consciously curated my dating profile to make myself look prudish. Seriously. I had pictures of myself in cute but modest clothing, minimal makeup, no drinks or partying. The people looking for a hookup weeded themselves out. "
Bearing the entire responsibility of birth control in a relationship even if it‚Äôs hormonal and can cause many side effects to women.
"I'm gonna go with peacocks. It's currently mating season for my local wild bird friends and let me tell you... if you've never heard a peacock they are LOUD. The males are screaming all day long and strutting around with their feathers all out, just desperate af. It goes from about 5AM to 8PM üòë It's really nice that guys don't come to my house all dressed up in flashy clothing and scream at me periodically throughout the day trying to get my attention for weeks on end. "
"Male moose pee in the dirt and then roll around in the urine mud puddle they made. The female moose find this very arousing and are drawn to the delightful scent. They soon mate.

I am glad men do not roll around in their urine in the mud and expect us to find that attractive."
"Only one girl in the group of 5.


Lack of random women.


And no-female-beasts.



In fiction it often looks like there are more boys/men. 
But women are roughly 50% of the population.


Women are everywhere. On the street, at work, in institutions and in groups of friends. When there's a race of ugly beast-creatures like giant spiders or trolls, it's logical that there are females, too."
"My mom's dog has to bring a specific pillow to everyone when they enter the house. You must take the pillow. If you don't take the pillow, he will just smash it into your leg over and over again."
A strong urge to cry at any given moment.
"Ignore the fact that my boyfriends relationship with my best friend was clearly inappropriate because I wanted to be ""chill"". 

Spoiler, he cheated on me with her. I am absolutely should not have been chill about it."
"Just lame things like downplaying my more stereotypical feminine interests and saying things like ""I'm not like other girls!"" because I wanted men to like me.

I realized that men who need me to be ""not like other girls"" would never actually respect me, because they don't respect women at all, and if I wanted friendships and relationships with people who treat me as an equal, that mindset had to go away. "
"His culture. His family wouldn‚Äôt accept me not being Hindu, and despite us trying to convince them otherwise for a long time, he ended up having to make a decision between following his family/culture, which would‚Äôve been an arranged marriage, or choosing me. Well we just moved into our first house last weekend! I can‚Äôt imagine how hard that decision was to make, I never badmouthed his religion or anything, just encouraged him to do what‚Äôs best. Still hard to believe I have someone like him!"
"Ex-SIL was bridezilla. She wanted both a bachelorette party AND a bridesmaids weekend at the spa with multiple activities (chocolate making, fancy champagne bar outing, supper) for which we were expected to foot her part of the bill.

 As I was a poor graduate student at the time, I offered to contribute to my share of the brides cost for the weekend and not attend myself. Ended up getting fired as bridesmaid a week before the wedding. "
I‚Äôm still in school so for me it‚Äôs basically just put on deodorant and not pass out
"This is a bodily function, but I'm including it because it still makes me laugh years after reading it: the male writer who described a woman sitting on the toilet for ages because the urine ""needed to make its way through her labyrinthine insides"". I don't think that writer will ever understand how hilarious he was being.

I wouldn't say this is always *wrong* per se, but it is exhaustingly common and dull: the strong tomboy kickass character who has a secret feminine or submissive side. Sometimes butch women are just butch, guys. They don't always have a secret yearning to be dominated by an even butcher man. Sorry to break this to you."
"His flooring while my dog had kidney issues and peed everywhere. His sleep, when the dog started peeing in his sleep (on my SO) in the middle of the night. Probably his sanity, listening to me fret about the dog 24/7. (Dog is fine now.)"
Those sea slugs that stab each other in the head to inject mind control juice into their partners.
"Sex experience, I mean sex - while you are completely unprepared and not enough turned on. Enjoy the feeling!üëå"
"don't fall in love with someone's potential. what you see is what you get, and it's not a personal failing or a sign that your love isn't good enough if they don't magically become the kind of person you ''know'' they are. figure out what you need to fix in yourself so you stop the need to fix others.

sadly, the only way to really actually learn this is to go through the grief enough times. when i was young, i heard the advice from older people and just thought ''pfft, they're just jaded and don't look for the good in people and give up too easily!''. there's a reason they say youth is wasted on the young!"
The mental health day is something that you just need sometimes. 
Extreme executive dysfunction. I can‚Äôt do anything. Even my fave hobbies
"As an Indian woman - I would want the men of my country to experience living in a joint family with their wife's parents and extended family, to understand the deep isolation and alienation married Indian women go through."
"No specific scenario, but an interaction where you can tell you're being treated worse because you're a woman, then the ensuing conversation with a male friend/family member where they pull the ""maybe he was just/did you consider"" 
"
That women invariably view other women as competition. The kinds of women I see in male\-generated fiction do not mirror the women I come across in real life.
"Praying mantis. I've never had sex good enough to warrant my whole head being eaten off. 

edit: Thinking back, maybe an ear. But not both. "
"I don't get in-grown hair - except when I try to de-fuzz my lady garden. I tried *fucking everything*. Shaving (with the grain, against the grain), waxing (strips, hot wax), moisturising, exfoliating, astringent, tea tree oil, I don't even remember anymore.

The only shit that worked in the end is the Magic razorless cream. It's meant for dudes with bald heads but it works just fine on your coochie. Slather it on for like 15 minutes (start with smaller increments, like 5, then 7, then 10 - to work out your own ""sweet spot""), scrape it off with an old credit card, get the rest off in the shower, moisturise.

It grows back at the same rate as shaving but ***no ingrowns***. Also a tube is like ¬£3 and lasts me for 2 months or so.

...god I sound like an informercial."
Yes. I wear dresses a lot and people always ask me why I'm so dressed up. I'm really only wearing a dress because I'm too lazy to find pants or I need to do laundry.
"My 8 month old Shepherd/Chow mix has been taught that 8:30 is bed time. Whenever we stay up later than that, he gets really crotchety. He flops, tosses, and turns on the floor making *very* audible sighs until I ask if he's ready for his kennel and he gets up, so excited like he thought I'd never ask. 
I thought I was instilling good routine skills, I just made a drama queen (king?) instead. üôÑ"
Having a life outside of your relationship. Like not spending all your free time with your SO and neglecting your friends &amp; family. Not having them read your texts from your family &amp; friends. Not get offended when they do the same.
"All the important things, but not every last detail. He knows I had one long term boyfriend who treated me badly, one who treated me well but we didn't work out, and one very short term boyfriend who cheated on me. He doesn't know an exact number of sexual partners but has an idea. We don't talk about that stuff much because it makes him a little jealous to think about my past, though he knows I have one and doesn't hold anything against me."
"Sex to women seems to be this amazingly emotional, bonding experience that unites her soul with his in a tangle of ecstacy.

Uh, sometimes a lady just wants to fuck. And it just feels good. It isn't a soul transformation or the reason we exist."
"He wakes up earlier than he used to so he can drive me to work (I‚Äôd have to walk 20 minutes and take a train otherwise), and then picks me up after work so we go home together. 

"
"Being the one ignored in social situations. So many times I will be with my spouse and approach someone to speak about whatever and they will 99% of time focus on him. Questions will be asked of us, and they will always look to him for his answer first.
"
"Everything. 

I mean, that's a broad broad broad statement, but it's basically true.  My boyfriend works offshore, on a 14 day on, 14 day off schedule. Therefore, he gets out of the gulf, gets on a plane, comes to me for 2 weeks, and then goes back.  

He's essentially giving up his entire life at home for me, which is everything.  Because in his mind, I shouldn't move down there because he's out in the water for 14 days, and I should have my friends for those 14 days."
"That once they hit child-bearing age all they want in life is to be a mother, at the expense of nearly everything else. "
"Or around falling in looove, like 99% of girl-coming-of-age ya novels feature."
"You might be in a codependent relationship if...

* You spend little to none of your free time apart. Spending a night or even an evening separately when you're both not busy is unusual and feels strange and uncomfortable.
* Aside from mandatory work or school stuff, you hardly ever leave the house without the other. You rarely to never spend time with your friends or family without them.
* One or both of you feels jealous or insecure when one partner chooses to spend their time on anyone or anything that isn't the other. Your emotions are not just influenced by but totally dependent on the other person's behavior. For example, your mood or even entire day will be ruined if your SO responds to you a little dismissively, doesn't text you back fast enough, or makes plans without you.
* One or both of you would never choose to spend time you could theoretically be spending with each other doing anything else. For example, maybe they drop whatever they're doing and race home the moment you're back from work, or maybe you ditch plans you'd made previously with your friends when your SO's plans fall through and they offer to hang out with you instead. 
* When you're not physically together, you're usually engaged in an active, constant text conversation -- and tensions/questions will be raised if and when one of you can't or doesn't answer promptly. 
* When you do talk to your friends and family, you very often find a way to springboard the conversation into one that's about your SO (and it's not because you're in a new/exciting relationship and just feeling euphoric). Feeling a constant need to post about your relationship on social media is a related flag. Somewhat paradoxically, codependent people tend to excessively gush to anyone who will listen about how wonderful and healthy their relationship is and how much they love their SO. 
* You go through and read each other's emails, texts, and private messages not in a ""I happened to be next to you when you got this"" kind of way, but deliberately.
* One or both of you has to ask permission to go out or make plans that don't involve the other. 
* All or almost all of your hobbies and interests somehow involve them.
* Your schoolwork, career, self-care, mental/physical health, and/or other relationships are dwindling or suffering because you spend so much time with your SO. 
* You spend time with your SO even when you know it will likely cause problems and get in the way of your responsibilities.
* You don't feel you have an identity without your SO. The concept of losing them terrifies you. You would be not only sad but completely lost as a person if anything ever happened to them or you split up. "
"I'm reading the Wheel of Time series right now... on book eight, and EVERY SINGLE TIME a female character crosses her arms, he writes ""she crossed her arms beneath her breasts"". I've read it hundreds of times by now, and it bothers me soooo much. Every time the book starts getting good, it pops up again and it's literally infuriating. Every. Single. Time."
"She wanted us to purchase matching necklaces.

Sounded just fine and normal... until we found out it was overpriced garbage from her sister‚Äôs MLM jewelry business (she was one of the bridesmaids too!). It was her idea and she convinced the bride to go with her jewelry in order to promote the business - which included promoting it to us, of course üôÑ

I didn‚Äôt buy anything from her, but she really turned on the sales pressure and it was an awkward 30 minutes. Thankfully, the bride completely forgot about the idea and I found a similar necklace from Forever 21. Wore that in the wedding."
"My dog buries every single new toy. He can't help it. But when it's the cat's toy he's kind enough to bring one of his own toys to her like ""Until it's time to take out the buried toy, would you like to play with this??"""
"I‚Äôm actually really lucky in this regard. Most of my friends and all of my roommates across the years have been women, so I get a lot of exposure to this. 

The dynamic is COMPLETELY different. The physical affection, the missing undercurrent of competition, the constant emotional concern and introspection, the lessened emphasis on externalized activity‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not like these things are necessarily missing from all male/male relationships, or a feature of all female/female relationships, but it‚Äôs so much more _common_ among women.

One of the biggest differences I noticed is that women _dote on their friends_. There just seems to be this instinct to care for each other. My female roommates always tend to be as concerned about my morning cowlicks as they are when I seem distant.

If it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôm in some kind of emotional distress (or even elation), I will very often be asked about how I‚Äôm feeling, and summarily given a stage upon which to confront and handle my emotions. It‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ freeing, to constantly be engaged with one‚Äôs emotional state. My stressors are acknowledged, my passions celebrated. People actually care about how I feel. I can only describe it as cerebral.

Conversely, male relationships so often feel like they have this sort of barrier to the heart, where each person‚Äôs emotional state is strictly their own business. No one wants to share or pry. It‚Äôs almost like emotions are treated as an inconvenience to everyone. The most you‚Äôll often get is a ‚Äúhope you‚Äôre feeling better, bro‚Äù, or an offer towards a distraction, like beer or video games. Rarely ever a direct confrontation of the issue, and even then it‚Äôs so often angry or tangy or dismissive (‚Äúyou‚Äôll get over it‚Äù, etc.)

The physicality, too. There‚Äôs just so much more platonic physical affection. Hugs, cheek/forehead kisses, holding hands and locking arms... It‚Äôs incredible how common these things are. And the doting extends to this too; women are constantly fussing over my appearance and attitude, always wanting to make sure I‚Äôm presenting the best side of myself possible. It‚Äôs done wonders to my self-confidence; I‚Äôm pretty decidedly average, but I always know in the back of my mind that there‚Äôs always something I can do to make myself shine just a tiny bit more. 

And for real, I get the sense that women just get a kick out of physical care. There was this one time I was helping a roommate dye her roots while we were both chatting about our days, and I entered what I can only describe as this sort of mutual-care zen. It‚Äôs addicting, knowing someone trusts you implicitly to make themselves physically vulnerable enough so that you can care for them. A connection forms there that I can‚Äôt really put into words.

I think most men lack perspective on the whole physicality aspect because it so often gets interpreted as romantic. It certainly explains why men rarely express physical affection with other men. And it goes both ways, too. I noticed that women tend to only get physically affectionate with me when they implicitly trust me not to make a move on them in response. The constant specter of romance is a _huge_ filter that hangs over any potential platonic cross-gender relationships.

Everything I‚Äôm saying probably sounds hyper-exaggerated to all of the women reading this, but‚Ä¶ I dunno. Maybe it‚Äôs ‚Äòcause I‚Äôm a guy who didn‚Äôt grow up like this, but it all feels magical to me. I feel incredibly blessed to be a part to this relationship dynamic on such a regular basis over the years, and I‚Äôm glad to see you gals don‚Äôt take it for granted. It‚Äôs something I really wish I could explain to my male friends. The only ones who seem to really get an inkling of what it‚Äôs like are ones in relationships, and sometimes I get the feeling they see it as a hassle.

Whatever man, they‚Äôre missing out."
"My friend and I were engaged at the same time. I choose simple bridesmaid dresses - with alterations they came to $140. I found out later that one bridesmaid threw a tantrum in the bridal salon when ordering her dress. She called my sister-in-law to complain about what a betch I was, how ridiculous the price was, and even threatened to not be in the wedding. I ended up having to pay for her shoes (I picked $35 ones that everyone liked but her)

8 months later, with her wedding planning underway. She sent me to the bridal shop to get fitted for the bridesmaid dress for her wedding. The dress was $550, and required a $300 deposit. I didn't say a thing, but the hypocrisy!

* THEN she asked for $350 to ""chip in"" for the group cabin rental for the wedding party. She was planning a destination wedding and wanted the wedding party to all stay together at some cabin.

* THEN she asked me to plan and host her bridal shower. Even though she didn't even attend mine because she ""got lost"" on the way there. 

* THEN she asked me to plan the bachelorette party. She wanted a night out at a fancy restaurant, drinking $12 cocktails at the ""higher end"" establishments.

She called off her wedding 2 months later. Luckily for me it was before the bridal shower and bachelorette party."
"That the character is (almost) always motivated by a man and/or child.

"
"Was invited to the bachelorette party... five days in advance. Of course nobody could make it, so they rescheduled. A couple of the bridesmaids put together a camping weekend, bought EVERYTHING we needed, and then the bride decided she wanted a hotel party at the very last minute. $200 a person with only a few days notice?!? I didn‚Äôt end up going :("
"Dumb girl(tm) act. I was a pretty good student, mostly As and hardly ever lower. But when I saw how most other girls were being asked out and surrounded by other guys, I decided to play dumb. I‚Äôd show up late, be lazy with homework, ask everyone for questions and purposefully just say stupid things. I thought I would be accepted if I did that, but spoiler alert: I wasn‚Äôt. It just spiraled into less of an act and more just ignorance and really was a depressing time for me. I wish I just did me and left that life alone.
But I digress.

Tl;dr played dumb to get attention, just made matters worse and crushed my grades"
"Bedbugs. 

The males evolved spiked penises so they could overpower the females that did not want to mate and penetrate their chest cavities to impregnate them. 

The females, in turn, evolved to have pseudo-vaginas on their chest cavities to avoid being killed.

I stop eating. I never notice because I simply don't feel hungry but other people usually notice. 
"I'm 63- I was a late bloomer and I'm *still blooming*   :)   
It is *never*  too late and it only gets better."
"I posted as a response, but here we go:

I helped her DIY her whole wedding, on a budget of like maybe 3k for the entire thing.

She wanted a Bridal shower and batchelorette party, all planned by us and paid for by us. that didn't happen because I was a full time student, one was out of state, and one is on disability. 

I made 120 Lavender Vanilla votive candles with custom lace and ribbon accents, with dried lavender embedded in the wax. 

I made all the bouquets/floral arrangements (she ordered about 500 red and black and white roses from somewhere and they all arrived in boxes and had to be refrigerated in like 4 different locations...) None of them were dethorned or trimmed down properly. 
 
I made half the centerpieces (Her fiance helped me with those)

I hemmed all 3 of the bridesmaids outfits. -I say outfit because it was a corset with a double skirt, the skirts were 6"" too long for all of us-

I spent 60% of the weekend keeping her family from killing each other over stupid things completely unrelated to the wedding. Ran interference to keep her grandmother away from her because grandma swore she wasnt going to the wedding and last minute showed up to start drama. 

AND I took photos at the reception.

She invited a ton of people and maybe half showed up. It was rough. the bridal party didn't sleep for a solid 2 days  before. 

I saw her maybe 3 times after the wedding, she's had a baby since and I haven't spoken to her in almost a year.

"My parents didn't have many hardships growing up, but my Grammy, who passed away a little over a month ago, grew up in a very poor area of Cleveland in the 1940s. They could barely afford to eat, so at Christmas they never had a Christmas tree. After Christmas was over and everyone was putting their trees out to be picked up by the garbage truck, my Grammy and her brother and sister would find one of the used ones outside and bring it into their house so they could have a tree for just a few days. It would be dying but they would decorate it anyway. It breaks my heart that they didn't even have the little things that make childhood magical. "
I was 30. And I know you're gonna hate to hear this (I know I did) but 22 is *so young* and by the time you're 30 it'll feel like a lifetime ago and you'll realize just how long your life is. It's ridiculous to think that you only have 20 some odd years (most of which are spent as a child) to find someone to spend the next 40-50 years with. You'll probably find lots of people to spend parts of your life with. 
"The boy I had a big crush on mentioned Justin Timberlake. We were both mostly into classic rock. Almost like a reflex I talked mockingly about JT. He wasn't the *cool* JT yet, he was ""the boy from a boy band teenage girls like."" And I wanted to look cool to him.

Turned out he actually had several songs of JT on his mp3 player (so did I!) I did similar stupid shit in the past but that was the last. It came with a bonus reality check how when you pretend to be different to impress someone, you might be unknowingly doing the opposite."

Doctors who don't take them seriously or who belittle their pain.

"I called a girl my brother was dating a lesbo (not to her face, just gossiping) because she had short hair. I identify as a lesbian now, so I guess I had some internalized homophobia. My mom found out and made me apologize to the girl, which I‚Äôm glad she did. I‚Äôve always regretted what I said and I‚Äôm glad my mom made me own up to it, and I‚Äôm glad she is open-minded about gay people. She was very accepting when I finally came out years later. "
"Everything and anything. I‚Äôm severely physically disabled (I was only minorly disabled when we met). My husband works full time, takes care of the house, cooks, does the laundry, walks the dogs, helps me with personal care (showering, getting dressed etc), drives me to appointments, fetches my meds, does the gardening, does the shopping so we have food in the house... literally ***everything***. 

The only time he does something for himself is when I encourage him to sit down on a weekend and play on his xbox. Even then, he‚Äôs constantly checking on me to make sure I don‚Äôt need anything. 

He used to go fishing and do downhill mountain biking all over the country. He doesn‚Äôt do those things anymore, even when I have asked someone else to be available to care for me so he can have some time to himself, he won‚Äôt go. He says he‚Äôd rather be with me because being with me makes him happy.

I quite literally owe this man my life. He deserves a sainthood. "
You mean sometimes women also come to terms with their parents' mortality?
"It always seems like female characters either eat so strictly (but it feels perfectly normal to them) or they ""like to eat."" 

Whenever a male character is impressed at how much a female character eats I bust a gut. WHY ARE YOU IMPRESSED? Half the time, she's just ordered a meat heavy dish and finished it. 

On that note: eats whatever she wants and has a teenytiny waist... Ultimate fantasy story. I want to live there. "
"A kids movie I saw featured a cow as the main character, with an udder and everything. Except they were gendered MALE, being another (again male) cow's son, male voice, pronouns, everything. Do people not know what udders are?"
"I know this isn't universal for women specifically, but the pressure that comes with hosting people in your home. Generally, I notice guys think it's fine to have guests over on a whim, but they don't understand that there's so many things for the host to pay attention to - things that typically fall on women in my experiences. The house needs to be clean, and if you want food and not to live off chips for hours, you better see what you have to cook. And yeah, I come off like I'm nagging, but if someone is unexpectedly in my house for the next six hours, I still need your help with some of the things I actually planned for that day, but maybe didn't vocalize because I didn't think you'd just invite your friend over on a whim."
"Based on the fact I've had to educate people twice in the last couple days about how women cry more easily, I'd force men to have a big dose of prolactin and see how easily they keep from crying as a stress response.

Because, no, most women don't cry to be manipulative. We're literally wired differently. "
"Ok, I have a persnickety kitty named Commander Zelda.  She distrusts anyone who isn't me, unless they have food.  She's my little shadow.  Even if I'm not home she ignores my husband, and glares at him because she's pissed he's not me.


We have two couches in our living room. One is his, and the other is ours apparently (Zelda and mine)


If I'm sitting on the wrong couch with my husband, this cat walks around crying.  It's not a normal cry. Her meow is broken and she screeches like a dinosaur.  She jumps up on the couch with us, lets me pet her, then jumps down crying some more.  Repeat until I get up, and get on the other couch and call for her.  She then walks around some more shrieking like a baby T Rex before coming over like she just *happens* to be walking by and jumps up to cuddle. "
"Put up with my ex repeated calling his colleague ""the most beautiful/perfect woman in the world"" to my face and was completely cool with him ""accidentally leaving his phone at work"" all the time (we were long distance then). I had a guess what was happening, but didn't want to seem jealousy."
Wow that is some petty shit. 
My general MO is inspired by an elderly woman who said her only regret in life was not telling enough people to fuck off.
"I‚Äôm in my mid-30s, just got a divorce, and only now do I feel like I‚Äôm starting to live my life. I‚Äôve spoken to a number of women who are older (60‚Äôs, 70‚Äôs), just went through their own divorces and told me ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never too late‚Äù.

And I completely agree. It‚Äôs all about perspective - if you want to do something, do it. Fear and hesitation is what holds you back, and what creates regret in the end. When you start to do things for yourself, age really doesn‚Äôt matter."
"If more social interactions could be like the warmth and welcoming environment of a line of women with a good buzz just passing time waiting for the bathroom, I might be more social. "
"Same. I also never replied to anyone who seemed like they hadn't read any of my profile, or guys who posted shirtless pics. As much as I love the male form, to me, shirtless pics say ""I want to hook up"" and not ""I'm interested in a relationship."""

"I cried laughing when I read this gem, I have no idea why he wrote that. Maybe because of the stereotype women take longer in the bathroom ? 
But you forgot the best bit : ""Men, they were able to conjure it up immediately, that was one of their powers, that thunderous splashing as they stood lordly above the bowl."" 

So here's antoher thing that males got wrong about us : We don't wish we could pee faster and we don't think men are special for peeing while standing up"
"I definitely think guys would gain a lot of perspective from the negative experiences mostly mentioned here (sexual harassment, pain, intimidation, etc.)

Another thing I'd be curious to see is how they'd experience having a female orgasm. Maybe some would understand the difficulty that can come for some women to get one, as well as why we want to cum too, and maybe even see why many women view sex as such an intimate thing instead of just something to do. "
Cramps. Really bad cramps. There would be a cure in no time if men had them.
"Ah yes, the sea slug. Colloquially known as the Bill Cosby of the animal kingdom. "
My left eye lid starts twitching and it gets crazy annoying after a certain point.
"Pretty much everything about this disease is what our society vilifies: so much stigma.  Fat, hairy but losing head hair, pain, bad periods, low energy, diabetes, low fertility, other diseases incoming, multiple doctors dismissing you, acne, dark skin folds, etc etc etc: all ugly, dirty, low-class things.  It doesn't look like a disease, it looks like depression, poverty, and/or mental illness.  And we can't fix any of them without massive, vast effort and medical intervention... if at all.

So first impressions of us are typically dismissive, and attempts to ""help"" us with some of these symptoms are laughably simple and depressing.  Oh, you lost 10 pounds by drinking smoothies?  That's great, hold on, I gotta take this handful of pills and go get my monthly blood draw."
Personally I don't trust people who can eat one cookie and no more. 
"I was 25, he was 29. We dated for a little over 2 years, and have been married for almost 8 years. If I had met him at 22, I would not have been ready for him yet--I did a lot of growing between 20 and 25."
WOW. Unbelievable. She sounds like a shitty spoiled person.
"To the men (and everyone, really, but I so far haven't had to remove any woman-on-woman invalidation here) reading this thread:

Last time I called it sick it was because I had 3 back-to-back interviews. Fingers-crossed.....Should hear back soon.
Being ‚Äúcatcalled‚Äù by a group of men whom you are very aware could over power you if they wanted to. Especially when visiting a foreign country... its a horribly degrading feeling. 
"I work in the esports industry (competitive gaming) for a very large and well-known company. The combination of the fact that I‚Äôm still in college and a woman makes people really unknown to that. It‚Äôs also something I don‚Äôt brag about and try to keep low-key. 

I just was working an event with a volunteer who didn‚Äôt know my background (I‚Äôm guessing he thought I was also a volunteer) and talking to him about the scene etc. and his duties during the event when he says ‚ÄúNo offense but you should let me handle X.‚Äù 
I took a deep breath and asked why 
He says ‚Äúoh, you know, I think I just have a better grasp on X‚Äù 
Keep in mind I‚Äôve never met this guy and he doesn‚Äôt know anything about me. 
I ask ‚Äúwhat makes you think that?‚Äù 
He kind of stammers and shrugs and says that he just has a lot of experience in it. 


I hate jumping to convolutions but it really felt like he was being that way just because girls in my industry are stereotyped and he was lumping me into a category that I didn‚Äôt belong in. 


The best part was that the next thing I told him was ‚Äúoh ok, well they picked me to do it because I work as an X with Y but if you think you‚Äôd be better fit-‚Äù and he immediately apologized, started asking how I broke into the industry etc. sad stuff. "
"Barks, wags her tail, and jumps on me when I get home"
"I have hobbies that don't include him, he has hobbies without me. We don't snoop in each other's phones. I don't tell him who he can't have as friends and vice versa. "
"I knew someone who got engaged wanted all her bridesmaids to lose weight. 
Luckily she didn‚Äôt even make it to the alter.

I have had a chin-length bob since I met the bride and had to grow my hair to shoulder length because she wanted a vintage look with specific hairstyles. The hair stylist said they could work with my length but it wasn't exactly what the bride wanted so she said no. 
"Honestly, I poop. Like, a lot. Anxiety and stress poops are the worst"
"My parents drank A LOT when I was younger. I remember every Saturday they would force my brother and I to go out with them to this farm where their friends got together. Everyone just got super shitfaced and I would always be really scared of the adults because they would act really strange or be throwing up everywhere. I didn't really understand the point of alcohol and why everyone acted insane on it. I told myself I would never touch it. But as I got older I felt more pressure to drink and I eventually started going to parties because I thought it would make me cool or it would make my parents think I had a life. Honestly I would have rather just stayed in my room all night but I only went to parties because I felt like I had to in order to keep up social appearance. 

I'm 21 now and I try to just avoid parties because of all of the bad things that have happened at them. Drinking is really dangerous as a young girl, especially if you're someone who tends to go too far with their alcohol. I still drink, but it's usually with close friends or just casual drinking by myself. "

"Wow, that is ridiculous!  I would be so offended if someone told me I had to dye my hair.    
    
I have a mowak and a bunch of large visable tattoos.  I was recently in my best friend's wedding and I was curious if she would ask me to wear my hair conservatively, when I asked her how I should wear my hair she said ""I don't care!  I love your mohawk, It's you!  Wear it however you want!""  I was so happy to hear that."
"Have you watched the series Jessica Jones on Netflix? I believe season one was directed by primarily women, and season two was directed exclusively by women.

I didn't know any of that when I first started watching, though, so coming across a well-written series with almost an entirely female cast (though it doesn't AT ALL feel like 'we are doing this to be inclusive,' it just feels normal) was such a delight. If you like super hero movies at all, I suggest  you check it out!"
She sleeps in my cold ass bedroom instead of the warm radiator in the basement. She also always uses her litter box no matter if I've forgotten to clean it. 
"A friend and I went to Paris for a weekend and stayed with one of her friends who took us to a party full of French people. My friend and I do not speak French. 

Even still, my friend said she was waiting for the bathroom, and a very drunk French girl came up and started telling her an involved story, laughing and gesturing and everything. My friend just laughed along and said, ""Oui!"" a bunch, and the drunk girl had a blast, and my friend had a blast.

It's beyond language, apparently."
"I'm actually pretty thrilled because I've figured out how to look pretty put together with essentially 0 actual effort in the morning.

I do [headband curls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhsUCKBVm4I) at night as well as wash/cleanse/lotion my skin at night so my skin is even in the morning. The curls last for a few days, and look beautiful in a ponytail and even after when I take the ponytail down.

Then it's just a matter of mascara, sunscreen, well fitted jeans, and a cute top.

Easy peasy! Takes me 15 minutes max to get ready in the morning, and that's with fussing over what to wear."
"my leg hairs do this super weird thing where they grow in flat, trapped underneath a top layer of skin. all i have to do is take a fingernail/pair of tweezers and scrape at the top layer of skin until i can coax them out.

"Before bed, my dog has to go around and smell all the heat vents and cold air returns. He's been doing this for a couple years now. He doesn't do it every night, but he does it more often than not."
"Let me paint a picture for you, I own chickens.

  So the female chicken runs from the male chicken which sqwacks aggressively and flaps its wings to let her know it wants to mate. It gives chase, but ultimiately is faster then her. He jumps on her back, grabs her neck with his beak, pins her to the ground, and aggressively and forcefully jackhammers her until it's over. Which is quickly. He gets off of her to let her run away and try to hide herself in shame while he looks around as if he's proud of himself and dares anyone to challenge that. 

I don't know the biology of it, but a chicken lives a miserable life."

"Customers refusing to roll down their window at the drive through because it's too hot out.  Manager thought that if this happened we should have them pull forward, stop everything we are doing, go physically outside and give them their food personally.

No."
"There‚Äôs an eagle or hawk where to prove their devotion to each other they lock talons and free fall in a bizarre game of chicken. They have to get as close to smashing into the ground as possible before breaking off.

There are some species of sea turtle, where when a couple start mating other males turn up and try and force their way in between then. They do this by trying to drown the couple so that one or both of them will break off in search of air.

Then there‚Äôs rodents. There are some hamsters that only come into heat after giving birth. So the males hang around for the delivery of the babies, sleep with the female and bugger off again. There‚Äôs also a species of rat type thing that only has about a 2 week mating season. As a result the males go into over drive to mate with as many females as possible. They stop eating and sleeping and looking after themselves. Basically the shag themselves to death. "
"I remember being in middle school (11-12 yo) walking home with a friend and noticed the trend about how construction workers always hit on us, whistled, or said creepy things from their trucks. At the time, we just accepting it as a part of walking home from school. Only in retrospect did I realize how absolutely disgusting it was for grown men to hit on a child. 

Thankfully, I‚Äôve never witnessed it happen to kids otherwise I‚Äôd go completely berserk on the pervs. "
"We came up with a completely different last name and changed both of our middle names to our former last names.  It required a Legal Name Change instead of doing it on the marriage certificate, but we think it represents us better than either of our former family names."

"Giraffes. Males will rub a female‚Äôs back side to make them pee, drink their pee to see if the female is in heat, stalk the female if she is. Female actively runs away which can attract more males.

How does this girl even have friends? 
"That women can be friendly, outgoing, reliable, strong, and independent with out being a part of the man-hating-women‚Äôs-club. 

Every book I‚Äôve read with a female main has the author write her off as this strong badass type who is disgusted by men and it always stems from a POS ex, or dad issues, or prior traumas involving men. 

Women don‚Äôt need POS men experiences to become strong and independent. 

Also,  all strong independent women are completely invested in their work life. 

I for once just want to read a good book when the main female character is friendly, outgoing, and excels at her career because she enjoys it. Not because she has a point to make for men. "

"Yep.

"My little girl cat (well, she's my SO's cat, but since moving in with him, I have adopted her as my cat too!) knocks over my shoes after I take them off. I usually wear heels to work and if I take them off at the door, she'll scurry over and knock them over every time.

If I was wearing sneakers, she'll stand with one paw in each shoe. I think because they're warm, but it's utterly adorable."

Eventually I got fed up with him acting like I was a pervert for actually wanting sex and threw him out. I've remarried since then and my new relationship is much healthier and more authentic."

"There is still a very prevalent mindset in media and IRL that womanhood = motherhood. It really irks me how many unnecessary baby-plots are thrown in at the end, or that's the only good thing that can happen to a woman's life, and makes any other identity seem like a speck. Also, how men can be men, co-workers, beer enthusiasts, friends, and uncles with children, whereas women can seemingly *only* be badass and independent, a lonely yet successful woman who yearns for a family, OR a Mom.

"I‚Äôm actually not having sex until I‚Äôm married, and I‚Äôve just recently started going on dates and getting myself out there a little bit. 
Most guys I‚Äôll tell them before we even go out. Just ‚Äúnot having sex, and I‚Äôm cool if that‚Äôs a deal breaker for you‚Äù. It gives us both an out. 

One guy I went out with a few times, after stating it VERY clearly and explaining my reasoning behind it. We had an extensive conversation about it and he seemed to, if not agree, at least accept it. 

Anyway, after one of the dates I went back to his house to use the bathroom since it was close by. I then said bye and caught the bus. He texted me and it came out that he was so shocked cause he thought we were gonna hook up. I was like, boy, no! Weren‚Äôt you listening? 

However, this other guy, I didn‚Äôt actually tell him in the time we were chatting.  We were on a date and kissing and I had to pull back and be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I gotta have this conversation etc etc etc‚Äù

"My cat fetches like a dog, but will only fetch rolled up paper or tinfoil balls. He will chase after it, retrieve it and bring it back to me to throw it again. He likes when I throw it up or down the stairs, or up on to his cat tree. He likes to do this multiple times a day to the point where he pants from exhaustion, and won't return the ball to me because he's tired. Yes, cats pant. It's super cute though. "

"We had to sell magazine subscriptions at the cashier stand, like ""you qualify for 3 free magazines!"" then after you sign up they bill you the other 9 months. It was a total scam and people called all the time angry about being charged for magazines when they thought they were free.

I was awesome at selling these magazines though because I made sure every customer 1000% understood that they had to call and cancel or they would be charged.

One day I was tasked with training a new girl at the finer points of cashier sales. We were in the employee break room and I was explaining to her how magazine sales are a total scam when my boss over hears and comes marching around the corner red faced and screaming at me. He's full tilt aggressively telling me how wrong I am and how much trouble I'm in for misleading the new girl. Every employee in the room was freaked out, but I just stood there and stared at him, completely unphased, because what he didn't know was that I had just been promoted at my other job. (Up until that point I had considered staying on part time so I could keep my discount, but he solidified my decision to quit then and there.)

So while he's gesticulating wildly with spittle flying everywhere, I just stared at him perfectly calm without breaking eye contact and said, yes it is a scam unless you explain to the customer how to cancel. He was so unnerved by the fact that I wasn't cowering in fear he began to back peddle hard. The look on his face of utter shock and disappointment when I stood my ground was priceless. It was like he was so let down that he couldn't scare me. He apologized later and I pulled the same trick, staring at him with a neutral face without saying a word. He spent my last two weeks trying to avoid me. 

This was probably the first time in my life when my spine began to harden. I guess I was embolden by the fact that I had a great promotion elsewhere and didn't have to worry about getting in trouble, otherwise I probably would've apologized and begged forgiveness to keep from getting a write up. My spine is made of titanium now, but it took quite a few years to fully form!"

I was in two weddings last year. One the bride literally said ‚Äúchoose what you want as long as it‚Äôs x color‚Äù.

The events in it were important in creating who we are today but that's about it. The past stays in the past as we walk forward into our future together."
"In a similar vein, I feel as if it‚Äôs common for female characters that are portrayed to be ‚Äúindependent‚Äù never have kids or [stable] relationships. It‚Äôs one or the other, which is frustrating for me. I thing female writers tend to do this also, though not as often. "

"I told my sister to find a black dress she liked.  We got married in Vegas, but we still had about 80 people attend.  It was a legit Vegas destination wedding.  I only had one bridesmaid because I felt guilty asking my close friends to be in it if they couldn't afford to go.  They all came anyway, so I should have asked!  My cousin was asked to wear a shawl because the bride didn't like her tattoos.  She was the only plus size bridesmaid, so she felt so uncomfortable wearing a shawl.  I was a bridesmaid in my sister's wedding, and she delivered all of our dresses to us, and I realized two weeks later that she had accidentally given me the wrong size.  No big deal, so I call of the other bridesmaids to see who accidentally got my size.  They all adamantly said they had the correct size.  I had to get mine altered the week of the wedding, and there wasn't enough fabric to make it my correct size.  It cost me more than the dress for the alterations.  I didn't eat for three days to fit in that damn dress, and it looked different from all of the other girls because of the alterations.  At the wedding one of the girls finally admitted that she actually did get my dress, but she was so grateful because she had gained weight.  I was furious.  "

"Sure, but that doesn't make black men behave much differently to black women, even if they can empathize with oppression at a personal level.

Kinda like how white women experience sexism and then go out and 'not get it' when it comes to other types of oppression.

"Mine has less impact due to the final straw being them letting me go, but...

* I had gotten zero training

* The owner of the company (very small) pulled myself and a few others into a meeting to berate us for something.  The problem ended up being something he did.  We never got an apology.

* Pay was constantly delayed (got my last check roughly a month or two after leaving)

* Due to the previous point, I would email asking for updates on pay every few weeks.

* I was also planning to quit if things didn't change soon

My final Friday there, I got hit by a car on my walk to work (I was a pedestrian).  I called, let them know I wouldn't be able to make it in that day, but would see them Monday.  Monday, despite being in quite a bit of pain, I hobbled my way there.  I had been working for an hour or two when I got an email letting me know that I was being let go due to the continued financial difficulties of the company (I'm positive I was let go for asking about pay ""too much"").  Needless to say, I was pissed.  Honestly, I wasn't that upset about being let go, but getting the email after I had spent an hour getting there (in pain) and an hour or two working felt horrible.  I immediately packed up my things, said goodbye to my coworkers (who were shocked), and left.

A few months later, I got an email from the owner saying they had some people coming in who were considering contracting the company for a project.  He wanted me to come back for that day (no pay), basically to make it look like they had a larger, more engaged team.  He let me know that if that went well, it was possible they'd be able to hire me again.  I laughed."

I'd go with whales. Because whale sex is basically a group of male whales pinning a female whale up against the surface of the ocean, and then using their freakishly long penises to sort of...navigate their way inside her.

"I did a lot of stuff I wasn't comfortable with sexually just to be ""wild"" and ""open-minded"" and other buzzwords I thought would make me ""cool"".  For the longest time I went along with my husband's kinks because I didn't want to admit that I wasn't it to it.  Deep down I knew we were probably sexually incompatible, but admitting that meant we would probably break up, so I just kept pretending to myself, and to him, that I was ""into BDSM"".  

Spoiler alert; I'm not.  We ended up divorcing due to more serious issues, and I'm now dating someone new.  I have many opportunities to get back in to BDSM and I just haven't.  We play around with submission and dominance but none of the more intense stuff I used to do.  The difference is now that I have a partner who I feel like I can say ""no"" to with no hard feelings.  He's very respectful and communicative.  

I also just got sick of not getting what I wanted.   If someone thinks my needs are too demanding, then they're not the person for me.  I used to think that I better just be grateful to have someone interested in me, and I better ""be cool"" to keep them around.  I now have a lot more confidence in myself and am not scared of being alone.  I'd rather be alone than with someone who isn't right for me.  And the best way to figure that out pretty quick is to be upfront with my needs and see how the other person responds.  "
"The same thing happened when my (20 year old) cat went hyperthyroid.

My boyfriend supported me AND the cat (that he didn‚Äôt even like/want) the entire time and did not complain once. 
He took him to the vet, cleaned things up when I was at work, gave him his morning meds, waited until I was ready to put him down, and not only came with me- but he paid for it and cried just as much as I did.

- On that same note, DON'T wear headphones at night. I actually avoid them entirely starting at around dusk. Again, the goal is to show people you can hear them.

- No phone out. No iPod out. No nothing. A lot of the time, if I'm just going to a nearby friend's or neighborhood bar, I won't even bring a purse - I'll just wear a coat with deep pockets and put my phone and wallet in there. I don't like to have anything on me that can be easily grabbed.

a quick anecdote, i work in the ‚Äúfast‚Äù food service industry ‚Äî i make coffee behind a counter. because of school, i work during the afternoon/evening. once i was working by myself, and this guy came up to my counter and did a regular order, but was just asking some personal questions while i was making his coffee (which included my work schedule, that i didn‚Äôt give him). i responded with one word answers, and when i gave him his coffee he looked me up and down and said (in the lowest, creepiest voice ever) ‚Äúyou look /really/ good.‚Äù again, i‚Äôm a teenage girl and this was an adult man. i told my boyfriend what happened and bc he works morning shifts at the same spot, and he said he would look out for him. well, he saw him the next time he was working and because the guy seemed nice when he was talking to my boyfriend, he said ‚Äúoh he probably didn‚Äôt mean what you think he did.‚Äù

it made me so angry! of course the guy wasn‚Äôt going to hit on *you*! although this incident is small (but not isolated, this guy always comes back),i feel like the credibility part is very true ‚Äî like he was just a kind-hearted man giving me a simple compliment and i was the hysterical teenage girl.

"I‚Äôm 38 and have started two long term relationships in my thirties, one of which I‚Äôm still happily in. I‚Äôm also beginning the process of buying my first home. 

I don‚Äôt feel as though I got a ‚Äúlate‚Äù start or that my life was on hold all this time. Every stage of my life is valid and meaningful. I‚Äôm not less of an adult because I rented a condo for a long time. And I‚Äôm not *not* living fully because I‚Äôve had multiple relationships instead of just one marriage. My life has been amazing and full of great things all along he way.

None of the milestones actually matter. You can try to follow a cookie cutter script but life doesn‚Äôt always happen according to scripts. The idea that you‚Äôll career &gt; marry &gt; house &gt; kids in that order at specific ages is a bullshit template that achieves nothing, puts unnecessary pressure on people, and often traps them into making bad decisions.

Live your life fully at all times and don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre hitting certain stereotypical goalposts."
"&gt;Put up with my ex repeated calling his colleague ""the most beautiful/perfect woman in the world"" to my face

So stupid ... she went on spring break there once with her sorority sisters and apparently it was the best time of her life. She just wanted to relive that memory. So we went and did a hike and rode horses and had a goddamn tea party for her.
"I stop feeling hungry and even if I feel tired I'm jittery in the evening and don't feel the urge to go to sleep. I will also start breaking out. 

Apparently stress response can stop your stomach from breaking down food...ergo your appetite can get affected. The insomnia is because I'm in fight/flight mode. The acne has got to be somehow related to elevated cortisol levels or something. Basically my lizard-brain gets way out of control before I connect the dots and realize I need a holiday, stat."

"I left work, took a test, ended up staying home the rest of the day but didn't tell my husband. I even parked my car down the street so he wouldn't know I was home and waited in the bathroom when he got home. When he *finally* came In  to take his after work shower, I scared the shit out of him and yelled ""hey! I'm pregnant!"" His response ""**FUUUUUUCCCKKKK**"" but once his adrenaline from the scare came down we laughed hysterically, cried and hugged.

"I had a good friend, L, who lived near me out in the woods when we were younger, and who I still hung out with from time to time as we got older and we moved elsewhere in the town.

Her folks lived in a double wide and then a manufactured home and seemed like they'd gotten together because of similar party-hard lifestyles. They had one too many broken down cars on their front lawn y'know and were a little trashy. But L was a truly sweet and caring person. She was loud and kinda hyper which was off putting to some people, but I didn't really mind. My mom didn't want me going to her house for fear of what I'd be ""*exposed*"" to ^(*shock, horror*). But the worst thing I was ever exposed to at her house was seeing what it was like to have irresponsible parents a couple rungs down the social ladder from me, and how it made L and her brother feel. I was just a kid but I knew that their parents fights and irresponsibility made them feel sad and that came out in ways like being too loud or hyper for attention. I *knew* this, even as a little kid. And still...

L wasn't popular, and as we got older our friend groups kinda shifted as they do. I wasn't popular either by any stretch of the imagination, but I was trying to avoid being marked as one of the outcast kids who got bullied. I was hanging out with a new group of friends in gym, and L came up to me and started talking to me in her loud, hyper way and some of the other girls were very plainly irritated by her presence and started talking shit about her. She ignored them and just continued talking to me as we walked around the track and I just lost it for some reason. I did something really cruel and I just told her to ""Shut the fuck up."" and ""Leave me alone."" and ""I am not your friend."" She started crying and I felt nothing for a hot minute. But later, once my sociopathic episode passed, I knew how wrong I was.

I don't know why I was that much of a fucking asshole in that moment, it was very out of character for me. I still feel incredibly bad about it. We actually renewed our friendship later in high school, but I never brought up the incident because I was a fucking coward and knew I was completely in the wrong to treat her like that.

I don't remember the girls I was trying to be friends with, I haven't glimpsed their shadows in a decade and have no desire to. But I have great memories with L and I miss her, and wish I could just cut that moment out of the past and burn it."

"I married my high school sweetheart.  He was always a bit of a worrier, but I think that over time that deepened into anxiety, and it turned him into someone who felt he needed to be in control.  And, as I was the person living with him and closest at hand, I clearly needed to be controlled as well.  

I really didn't see it at first.  It expressed itself at first as simple non-enthusiasm about certain things I did, which over years shaded into clearer disapproval -- things like drinking soda or my academic interests.  My personal difficulty in orgasming became personally offensive to him -- he felt like it was an insult to him, and he got defensive and asked why I wasn't like ""normal girls"" and the like.  

He had me thinking I was lazy, unliked, dumb.  I was ashamed of myself, I apologized and cried, but nothing I did ever seemed to make it better ... and at some point, thanks to lots of therapy, I was able to say that even if everything he said was true, *even if he was right*, I still didn't have to stay there and listen to it.  So I left, after 18 years of marriage.  "
"I agree with this. Part of the reason I separated from my LTR with my ex is that I was on depo for years and years, and was scared to get a tubal done, and he refused a vasectomy. Wouldn't wear condoms, so it nullified our sex life. 

Also, along the vein of what you posted, the last dude I was seeing refused to orgasm inside during PIV sex even though I have an IUD, because ""birth control fails"", but again, he wouldn't wear condoms (we were both clean, we were tested). It was a huge dealbreaker for me, because I didn't sign up for a relationship where we couldn't have that intimate connection.

EDIT: We started seeing each about 2 weeks before I got the IUD put in, and he kept saying how excited he was that he would be able to have sex with me PIV without worry... Then he changed his tune."
"In my 40 years of working I only called in sick when I was not sick one time.    
We had eaten pot brownies too late the night before and when I woke up feeling gnarly and stupid I did not know what was going on.   
Once it dawned on me that I was high I had to call in sick as my job required meticulous use of sharp instruments on people and I knew I was incapable of performing responsibly."
"Yeah, I would say just the low-key every day lifelong sexism and subtle threat of violence that has pervaded my existence my entire life to the point where it feels normal. That. That baseline. "
"I was 17 years old and my family had just moved to a bigger city. I took a job in a small lunch counter (burgers and fries, ice cream, shakes, etc.) attached to a department store in the mall. I had a hard time making friends and my dad told me I didn't really have to work if I didn't want to and he would fund my leisure money. I had been working in some form or fashion since I was about 10 so I stayed at the job.

One of the tasks in my position, besides serving customers, washing dishes, etc, was to clean the grease filters over the grill each Saturday, a difficult and, frankly, gross task. There was another guy on the other shift who was supposed to share these responsibilities. We were supposed to alternate cleaning the filters. For two weeks in a row he ""forgot"" to clean the filters and I got stuck doing it. The third week when he ""forgot,"" I mentioned to the manager, for the third time, that it was his turn and he should have done it.  She just said, ""Tough shit,"" and told me to do it anyway. I took off my apron, dropped it at her feet, and walked out without a word. I had them mail my final check to me and took my dad up on his offer until I graduated high school.

First and only time I've ever done that in 50 years of working. Felt damn fine.

"
samesies! I also shut down and go on endless binges of trash tv or I hole up in bed with a book and kind of shut out the world for longer than normal. Alternately doing too much yoga and feeling the pent up emotions flooding out or trying to numb it out with too much weed.

"It's not that it's completely out of our control, it's that it's harder. (Disclaimer: Every PCOS case is unique and not all PCOS-sufferers experience this.) It's like the difference between going for a brisk walk and trying to scale a mountain. I feel like I am hungry literally almost all the time. The longer I ignore it, the worse it gets, the harder it becomes to ignore. I can eat something and be hungry again 10 minutes later. I can try telling myself that it's in my head but that doesn't help. 

Years of weight cycling has only made this worse. 1200cal feels like starving. No, keto won't help. Yes, I've tried cutting carbs. Yes, I've tried counting my calories. Yes I've tried loading up on fruits and veggies. The ultimate problem here is that my body is telling me it's hungry when it's not and that is really difficult to live with. 

It also doesn't help that I'm surrounded by morons who won't listen to me. I ask them not to bring me candy or food and they do it anyway. You might be thinking ""well, exercise some discipline."" That's easy to say if you don't know what it's like trying to ignore feeling like you're starving only to have someone come along and wave chocolate or pizza in front of your face.

But even despite all this, I still manage to always remain under 1800cal a day. I also jog a half hour every day. And I still don't lose weight because something is seriously wrong here.

In theory, it's not impossible for me and people like me to lose weight. It is, however, a great deal harder. The reality is that if maintaining a healthy weight was equally easy for everyone, no one would be overly thin or overly fat. "
Lost 70lbs.   I feel like a new person.   I'd still like to lose at least 30lbs more and have gotten stuck but I'm still so proud of myself.  
That right there is love and commitment.
"Best male friend getting married, so asked to be bridesmaid. Bride had THREE showers! One for groom‚Äôs side, one for her side, one couples shower. Attendance and gift for each. Registered at top of the line store only, with all designer items on list, nothing under $200. Then expensive never wear again dress, dyed shoes to match, specific hair ornaments. Wedding was at 4:00 pm, bridesmaids had to be at her house at 8:00 am, so the photographer could shots of every moment of prep for the day. i.e. bride wakes up! MOH applies mascara! MOB cries in every picture. No lunch, at dinner after wedding, had several drinks from cash bar and got plastered. Two years later, same bride has baby shower. So many gifts from wealthy relatives, she was opening gifts for FIVE HOURS!!! They are now divorced, after she cheated on my friend. Ugh!"

I‚Äôve known rabbits that were more inventive and resourceful than your average adult female movie character. They‚Äôre not so much people as really interactive RealDolls.

Suddenly, 90% of protagonists and characters are women by default and most of the male protagonists are just fan service for women. There are now movies, books, TV shows, and videogames that feature all-women casts and no one thinks this is unusual. The stories of women are told far and wide while stories that truly focus on men are branded as their own ""niche genre"" and relegated to back shelves, obscure indies, and late night showings. Most leading or otherwise important male roles are only cast for men between the ages of 18 and 25. Men over the age of 25 are usually typecast as villains/bad guys or dads/grandads or excessive mention is paid to the fact that they're ""old.""* Fat men are almost never cast and on rare occasions when they are, it's almost never as a serious, well fleshed-out character. It's considered weird to have a group of characters with more than 1 male for ever 3 females.  

Most male characters are hyper-sexualized, scantily clad, and very inadequately dressed or inappropriately dressed for their scenarios and settings. Suddenly, most male characters are reduced to the traits that women find sexy, rendering them as little more than eye candy, plot devices, window dressing, and prizes to be won. Suddenly, male characters are often depicted in very sexist ways that play on ridiculous stereotypes. Male villains are often used as a means of demeaning certain aspects of masculinity or maleness and very rarely have any real motivations or personalities outside of showcasing obnoxious sexist stereotypes.

When men speak out against this, they are marginalized, mocked, harassed, and even subject to death threats or rape threats. They're branded ""SJW,"" shouted down, and piled with sexist insults. They're told there's nothing wrong with well oiled, mostly nude, impossibly attractive men running around in golden thongs or loincloths or jean short-shorts or whatever have you, all the time, in any movie, film, story, or TV show, in every role. Police officer? No. *Sexy* police officer. Firefighter? No. *Sexy* firefighter. President of the United States? No. *Sexy* President of the United States. 

Arguments will crop up about how artists should be free to express their creative visions however they want without criticism, even if that includes several entire industries' worth of depicting men as sexualized fan service for women. Men will often be given token bit parts just so movie producers, game devs, show runners, and writers can say ""see? Look! I included a man. I'm not sexist!"" Women will insist that representation doesn't really matter. You don't need to have matching genitalia to be able to empathize with or enjoy a character. Most stories are now marketed to women and women's interests which is considered perfectly normal. 

Someone will create a ""brave"" movie, film, game, or book that features bold, revolutionary male character who is really just more of the same in disguise. The few who notice this and point it out will be called sexist and bullied into submission while everyone else claps about the progress being made. Sexism against men will be declared ""over"" because of this one ""brave"" contribution to the zeitgeist.

I could keep going...

"I was 16, but now that I'm 39, I see that I was a HUGE minority.  Most of my friends didn't meet their spouses by your age, and out of the few that did, there are plenty of divorces.  Please don't feel discouraged.  There's lots of time! "
"I think your assessment is an excellent description of what I meant. As for the doting/emotional concern, that's exactly what I meant about it being practically a romantic relationship. 

I think a lot of straight men only get that kind of relationship from a girlfriend/female significant other, which is seriously a shame. That leads to a lot of men misinterpreting women's niceness as romantic interest, and makes it so that even a dude with a lot of male friends suffers a lot (maybe more or differently than the female partner) after a breakup. It's also tough for the woman in a heterosexual relationship because it's a lot of work for one person to take care of alone, and men aren't as used to performing that kind of emotional care.

It's got such a ripple effect, but it would be beneficial to *everyone* for men to have these kinds of relationships outside of a romantic partner! "

In reality... I was 11, wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, and walking to school when a man (40s?) in his car starting slowly driving next to me to tell me ""how hot my ass was"". I didn't tell my parents because it was so hard to believe that an adult could act that way. I figured I had done something wrong to make him say something weird like that.

"Not the bride, but the bride's MIL. I was maid of honour, I planned a modest bridal shower with the bride's closest friends and family since my friend specified she didn't want anything too extravagant and didn't want too many people that she isn't close to. Everything was set. 

Then one day I get a message from the MIL, saying how rude it was that I didn't invite most of her extended family, and proceeds to invite about 12 extra people. I was kind of annoyed but whatever. So I send her the information about the time and place, and let her know the restaurant that it was being held at was about ~25$ per person just so they know in advance. She then sends me this novel of a Facebook message, saying that I was a horrible MOH because I'm not footing the bill for everyone going. I explained that as much as I'd want to throw the bride a really lavish party, it just wasn't within my means at the time. I was going to university full time and working two jobs to make ends meet. And she just wouldn't take no for an answer, kept sending me constant messages, complaining about the venue, saying i didn't know basic etiquette, she would always post very passive aggressive statuses on Facebook that were clearly directed at me. I ended up having to organize a different party from scratch that suited what she wanted. It was such a nightmare, never want to be a bridesmaid ever again. "

"&gt;Doctors who don't take them seriously or who belittle their pain.

My wife was struck by a car when she was 16, it was a small car, think 1990's civic hatchback size. The ambulance and police arrive and she's carted off to the hospital as a precaution, Everything checks out. 2 months later her knees swell daily and it's hard for her to walk, I take her to the doctor after she tries a few methods to reduce pain and swelling to no benefit.  The doctors response to this after knowing full well she was struck in the knees by a car was because she's turning into a woman, her hips are widening therefore her knee caps aren't gliding along their socket properly causing inflammation near the joint, she needed to get over it because it's something most young women experienced when their bodies are prepping for ""adulthood"".

"I used to do this thing in middle school where I really internalized a budding idea of confidence and empowerment in a totally useless way, and I thought that projecting ""Attitude"" was the key to being liked. I wasn't quite brave enough to do anything like speak up in my classes with attitude, so I just tried to walk around and pose with attitude. 

I remember spending whole recesses and lunch periods trying to perfect the model/music video walk... think like Beyonce in pretty much any video ever. They always played music on loudspeakers out in the quad, and I'd just.... strut back and forth. Alone. Hips poppin' and swaying, powerful heel strike, thumbs in my pockets, pouty lips and jaw thrust forward. 

This probably looked hilarious. I had grown quite tall but also fat in awkward places, and I hadn't quite learned how to dress myself, so I always just looked kind of lumpy and dumpy. Greasy hair because I had a weird fear of washing my hair. Super childish blingy jewelry bought at Claire's. Blue eye shadow, and a million layers of lip gloss so my lips looked like they were covered in gobs of lube. Bright pink circles on my cheeks from not understanding how blush works. Then low rise jeans that wouldn't stay on and comically small t-shirts that still looked like mom shirts. 

And there I was, strutting like I was hot shit, and I felt like hot shit. Every time ""Let Me Blow Ya Mind"" came on, I felt like ""This time... this time they'll notice."" I kept looking for the jaws to drop. I'd pose dramatically, leaning back so far against a wall to look ""casual"" that I looked like I'd fallen. Sometimes I'd have a deck of cards with me. Why? Who knows. 

I did this for about a quarter of the year before realizing that probably no one would suddenly realize my hotness from just strutting back and forth a lot. "

She's been trying to sue for negligence but it's been an uphill battle, ranks have closed and so on. 

It's up to you, of course, but I've seen a lot of vulvas and not one has put me off ever. I'd say if it works, don't mess with it but if you decide to, read up on the risks and complications and don't let anyone tell you it's not a big deal. It is and the consequences can be dire."
"This is what just happened to me too, except I got ""voluntold"" which dress I'd wear by the group because it's strapless and I'm the least busty. On top of that the dress is way more expensive than I thought and it's going to have to be heavily altered. We were told the dresses would be made to our fit which wasn't true. To be fair, the bride was told this and I think she found out that wasn't true when we ordered our dresses. The price would have been okay if the dress came altered but after the alterations it's going to be more than I've ever spent on any piece of clothing. It's also an extremely formal dress, so I'll never wear it again. The very formal style actually seems a bit out of character for my friend but I think there may be some family pressure.

It's going to be a fun wedding but the dress is sitting in my closet staring at me to be altered and it's  just another chore I don't want to do/pay for. I'm sure it'll be nice when it's altered."
"This one makes me laugh too.  I have an objectively really gross job, and on average when I talk about it, *men* are the ones that get grossed out and squeamish and freak, while women tend to ask questions and be fascinated. "
"""But why do you hate men???"""
"""Hi! We're the Cunters and these are our children Hunter, Gunter, Punter, and Mike."""
"Periods! Men get a head cold and ‚ÄúTHE WORLD IS ENDING‚Äù yet I am expected to go into work and do household chores and cook dinner etc. while my uterine walls are falling out of my vagina for one week every month.

PSA: I am currently PMSing. "
Legitimately being so wary and carful on daily basis that you need to talk yourself into trusting that every male you come across is not a possible threat to you.
"It's not minor at all it's indicative of how society, especially men, see and treat women.

I used to have a green cheek conure named Cheech because the only noise she‚Äôd make was a screech that literally sounded like a toddler yelling CHEEEEECH. So when people would come over we‚Äôd introduce her as Cheech and then we‚Äôd say ‚ÄúSay your name!‚Äù And she scream CHEEECH and people would be impressed even though she has no idea whats going on and yells CHEEECH every 2 hours. I miss that little turd.
"It's such a weird thing to think we're being manipulative when we cry. Crying on demand is hard, many actors use eye drops because it's just not easy to cry when you're not actually feeling it. "
"Awful. 
My parents spent more time in bars and throwing parties than they ever did at home. 
There was them and 5 of us kids. We were ‚Äúraised‚Äù by whoever happened to be around.
I distinctly remember my little sister being pretty sick when she was maybe 2-3 and my mom and dad couldn‚Äôt be bothered to stop partying to take care of her. I sat up with her all nite. Even though I was only about 5, I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. She ended up being fine.
I‚Äôve heard lots of stories from people who feel so sorry for us because our parents weren‚Äôt there for us.
Some say it all doesn‚Äôt matter because they still bought us whatever we want and we are all ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù (as though the fact that all of us have some sort of mental health issue and only 1 of 5 wasn‚Äôt a teen parent has nothing to do with our parents‚Äô neglect).
As soon as my second oldest sister was old enough to feed, clothe and take care of us, we were at home with her almost every nite.
If mom and dad didn‚Äôt go out, they partied at home and I‚Äôd go to school worn out because their loud music kept me awake all nite.
I was actively encouraged to get drunk at about 13 years old.
I could go on and on about how shitty it all was, but you get the picture.
Thankfully, my parents have mellowed a bit with age and are excellent grandparents to mine and siblings children. 
I have, in some sense, made peace with my childhood, but it‚Äôs hard not to think about how things could have been different.

EDIT: I‚Äôve posted in other subs recently stating I have 9 siblings. I have 4 half and 5 full siblings. I only include the 5 who grew up in the same house with me in this comment. The others are much older. "
"How focused they are on sexuality. For male writers, a woman coming of age realises that she's ""turning into a woman"" by noticing her breasts or how boys react to her. I've never known a woman who's thought that way. "
I‚Äôm about to turn 30 and starting back at college to finish my bachelors which will be another 2 years. No kids and not married but they are definitely things I want. 
"i‚Äôve heard a man say he‚Äôs ‚Äúscared to hold doors for women now because of feminism‚Äù and it made me roll my eyes so hard. i‚Äôd be willing to bet most feminists don‚Äôt really care about that type of stuff. 

also, i hate how sometimes when feminism comes up in conversation *the very first thing* a guy says is ‚Äúdoes that mean i can punch a girl in the face??? because that would be equality.‚Äù like, what does it say about you that your main concern is whether you could physically harm women or not. when a guy says that, i just know the conversation isn‚Äôt even worth my time. "
"In Jane Austen‚Äôs novel Persuasion, the main character points out that a great personality will win over anyone who initially finds them unattractive. I find that to be true. I‚Äôve had drop-dead gorgeous acquaintances become gross to me because of their shitty personalities. I‚Äôve fallen in love with conventionally ‚Äúmeh‚Äù guys because of their charisma. So when I feel ugly, I try to just ramp up my inner goodness and charisma. "
"That seems odd to me. I don't need to know everything. Some big things, and maybe knowing things you should avoid talking about or whatever, but I don't really care much about talking about my exes. Not that it's hard or bad, it's just kind of a non topic for me"
Had my leg stroked at a bus stop at age 12 by a white-haired man asking if I had a boyfriend. I was out with my grandmother but she didn't notice. I was confused and didn't know how to respond. Later on it made me feel bad but I didn't know why. 
"I stopped wearing makeup to work altogether. It's been a great break for my skin and although it took some time, I'm finally feeling comfortable without it. I try to lay out my clothes the night before work so that I don't fuss over what I'm going to wear for 20 min. Brush teeth, put on some DO and voila!"
"I‚Äôd have cut off being her friend after the bridal shop visit, no real friend would use you as a ‚Äòbridal bank‚Äô."
"Why give them just cramps?! They need the full magical experience! They need a whole month to experience the emotional swings and to have someone to make a joke about how ‚Äúit must be that time of month‚Äù even when it‚Äôs no where close. They need to experience the PMS symptoms of binge eating because you can‚Äôt stop eating and crying at literally nothing. They need to get bloated and not feel like having sex cause they feel gross and then hear ‚Äúoh no, babe, you‚Äôre still handsome to me!‚Äù They need to hold onto that water weight for several days so they hit weight loss plateaus every month for what seems like ‚Äúno reason‚Äù. They need to go spend $15-20 a month on tampons and pads. They need it all! "
"I‚Äôm gonna be getting married soon and fuck I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not so petty as to dictate my bridesmaids hairstyles. Like they‚Äôre women I care about, I want them to like how they look and not alter their entire appearance just for one event. I‚Äôm totally gonna let my one best friend wear a suit or something instead of a dress because I know that‚Äôs what she feels comfortable in. "
"I currently am harboring crushes on five friends from college, four classmates from middle-school, six co-workers, three family-friends, around twenty employees of Rooster Teeth Productions, approximately thirty fictional characters, and an indeterminate amount of random people I have meet or seen in media who were super cute. 

I have never been on a date in my life."
"Well, now I‚Äôm sad"
"Two women walk into a bar, one says to the other ""Have your heard about the Bechdel test?"" and the other replies with ""Oh yeah, my boyfriend was telling me about this the other day""..."

"She will only eat if someone is with her, and sometimes only if it's her favourite human. When my partner and I first started living together she would only eat when he came home, and would be so excited that it would be like power eating. She will also only eat one piece of the dog biscuits at a time, picking one out of the pile, turning her head away, chomping it and then coming back for the next one. For the whole bowl.

She has a toy broccoli that she thinks is her baby, she cleans it, carries it and cries if she leaves it outside by accident. Not sure why she picked a rubber broccoli over the fluffy toys she has but clearly she identifies with it! "
"Because I just *can't.* Just can't be an adult today. Just can't face making chit-chat with people. Just can't have a good attitude. Just can't focus on work. 

Lots of reasons that I take a sick day. Mostly for mental or personal health rather than actual sickness. 

My life is not all about work. And somedays I can't fit it in without making myself very unhappy. "
"Everything got better.

My parents were overbearing and watched everything I did.  While this wasn't always malicious, it was stressful and annoying.

Moving out was one of the best things in my life, really."
Plenty of sculptures of women in various states of undress though. 
"How often I think about sex and how rarely I think about getting into/being in a relationship.   So much media is about women dreaming of finding ‚Äúthe one‚Äù or being lonely or incomplete. When I was single, my life was full and interesting. Even though I am married now, I am a full and complete person on my own. I have a career I am passionate about and hobbies I enjoy. "
We're both enthusiastic amateur astronomers so we wanted something celestial sounding.  We started looking up star names and sounding out variations of the ones we liked and picked from those.
I'm going to be a bridesmaid in the Fall. The bride wants us to make our own bouquets and centerpiece floral arrangements for the ceremony \+ reception in an attempt to save money. She once worked as a cashier for a wholesale flower shop and now believes she has the skills to make her own arrangements. I can already envision staying up the night before assembling stuff.... God I hope she changes her mind....
No hot single woman is ever alone at the bar waiting for a dude to pick her up. 
"I'm 21 and this is still my strat.

Leggings and oversized jumpers every day. I'm just not someone who cares about looking polished - although when I start my job I'll need to make the effort for that. Looking for secretly-comfy work trousers rn."
Being vulnerable with people requires a quiet kind of boldness that I try to embody
"I don't know how to synthesize it into just one lesson but I was in a ~3 year relationship that ended poorly and, two years later, I find many lessons.

1. Don't lie to yourself about if you are unhappy and the source of the unhappiness. If, for over a year at a time, you find yourself thinking ""I'll be happier with my SO once my work situation gets better,"" it isn't just work that is causing you to be unhappy.

2. Don't lie to yourself about their flaws. Everyone has flaws and part of being in a relationship is the transition from the honeymoon phase to the phase where you get who they are but love them anyway. But what if getting who they are means that you can't be with them? What if those behaviors that you learn to recognize are actually abusive, or signs of mental illness that are beyond either of your capacity to deal with? Cut your losses.

3. Cut your losses. Learn the sunk cost fallacy. Never stop thinking about the sunk cost fallacy.

4. If you think you give more than you get, don't expect other people to recognize this. If you feel like you are giving for three straight years and the other person is borderline mooching off of the warmth in your heart, the other person is never going to feel like they should pay that back, they will keep mooching.

5. People do change, but not always for the better. People can become worse people. You can't expect someone to grow into the person that you want them to be.

6. The fact that you are attracted to someone and have similar personalities, and even grow to love each other, is not going to be enough to keep a relationship together. If neither of you can stand to participate in the other's hobbies, and you have a lot of conflicting values, that might be a sign that things are gonna go south, even if you really like boning each other.

7. If you can't talk about poop after 2 years, that's a bad sign.

8. ABUSE IS ABUSE. Don't write it off. Abusive behaviors ARE VERY SERIOUS and you should never just assume that they will grow out of them.

9. Cultural issues are very real. I am Indian. My parents are Indian. That comes with things. So does being Jewish, or Korean, or WASPy, or Catholic, or whatever. Even if you don't actively participate in a religion or a cultural heritage, it will still be part of who you are. I am not saying don't date people from outside your bubble, but I am saying that you can't just pretend that these things don't matter, ESPECIALLY to an SO's parents. My ex was not racist, but I never felt welcome by her parents, she didn't stand up to me to them. To be fair I don't think she saw what I saw, the microracism and stuff that you only notice when you've been doing it your whole life, and I didn't really point it out to her. But that's kind of my point here, you can't expect people to see the world  in ways that you only would if you grew up in a certain skin color or heritage or religion, and you have to recognize that. 

10. If you find that you start thinking that it's a good idea to use the info that you know about your SO (as in, the intimate details of their life that only you know and that they told you in confidence because you've been together for so long) in a manipulative way, you should cut your losses and also realize that you aren't able to live to the best of your ability with this person. 

If people like this post I can add more."
"We all (3 bridesmaids and a family friend) had to pay $300 each to stay at the homestead venue two nights, because she had to hire the whole venue for exclusive use of the B&amp;B homestead. 

.. at the time I was a single mum and lived a 15 minute taxi ride from the venue. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of her cheeky tactics to keep her own costs down, but also didn‚Äôt want to argue after witnessing a meltdown over someone else saying ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù."
My 4 year old Yorkie is EXACTLY the same except his bedtime is 9pm. Weekends are a nightmare when I dare to stay up later! I tell people who visit that he‚Äôs a creature of habit but I know they think he‚Äôs high maintenance really. üòÇ
A lot of his time. He works a demanding full time job so I can stay home and raise our baby. I love him so much for it. 
"‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a compliment!‚Äù 

Till you ignore them and they aggressively insult you."
This is how I felt about the Bee movie. 
Or getting revenge for sexual assault.
"Related: men who assume ""DDD"" means ""humongous"". The cup size alone tells you nothing without the number! I have DD's, but you wouldn't guess it from looking at me because my band size is quite small. There's a huge volume difference between a 28D and a 40D. I could probably fit an orange into the former, whereas you could fit your whole head into the latter. "
"This! I feel there would be so much more birth control options for men if they fully understood the side effects. Depression caused from birth control, for example, is no joke. "
"Not much, and I don't know that much about his, and I like it that way."
Stories like these really make me wonder how these women have any friends to be bridesmaids in the first place. 
"God, this made me furious in one of the worst books I ever read. It was a post-apocalypse story and the mayor of the town was a woman. I could feel how congratulatory the author felt toward himself for making that choice (""Gosh I'm forward-thinking!). At one point they are discussing what to do with the dozens of bodies that are piling up and she is making very decisive statements about this situation. Immediately after this, a male character awkwardly asks if they have enough ""feminine products"" in the town and this lady TURNS RED and is EXTREMELY EMBARRASSED by the question. Come on now, like she didn't know women had periods?? 

Also this question is offensive because like, you don't actually need to have specialty products? That is a relatively recent development. Just use old rags? "
