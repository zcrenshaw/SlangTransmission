"Basic domestic skills. Cooking, cleaning, looking after yourself. 

Financial literacy. Knowing how to make a budget, living within your means, being able to save for the future.

Healthy habits. Eating well, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, drinking enough water etc.

I tend to think these are just things everyone should be learning as a young adult, not because it'll make you a better partner, but because you'll just be a better more independent responsible person."
"""What a shithead."" He had just accidentally backed into me as I walked behind his car in a CVS parking lot. We just got engaged last week! "
"My ex got angry at me because he thought period blood could be held in like a bladderful of pee. He thought that the pad and tampon industry were lying to women about the necessity of those products to make a quick buck on the ignorant masses. That women who used pads or tampons were either too dumb or too lazy to hold it in, the way a man would if they got periods. This didn't come up until months into our relationship because of my irregular cycle. When he made remarks that hinted towards this belief, I thought he was joking. He thought I was able to hold it in (because to him, I was *not like other girls*) until we were driving somewhere and I needed to stop to buy some tampons and he launched into this petty tirade about it. I tried to explain basic biology to him, but he insisted I was making excuses and he insisted that he knew more about anatomy than I did. He was not terribly bright. "
"A friend from childhood through high school said to me as an adult, ""I used to feel so bad for you, growing up in a house with no love in it."" 

Wow, what an epiphany, and she was totally right."
"I started to struggle with math in sixth grade. My mom requested a meeting with my teacher to see if there was anything he recommended she should do to try to help me at home to bring up my math grades. I sat at my desk while they talked at the front of the classroom. Next thing I know, my mom is yelling, and she stomped out of the classroom, and stormed down the hall towards the admin offices, demanding to see the principal.

My teacher had told my mom the same thing he had been telling me for months: ""Don't worry, girls don't need to know math."""
"My ex boyfriend from high school was asking me about my period. They were pretty basic questions and I was happy to explain the answers. Then he hit me with "" so how big is the egg?"" He was completely serious."
"I had one friend who always told me my heart beat was fast while around him and would tease me that it was because he made me nervous - I wasn't, and my heartbeat felt normal to me. Until months later I went into the doctors for some antibiotics (I hate the doctors, haven't been since I was younger) and all the nurses were freaking out about my pulse. A million and one tests later, turned out I had tachycardia and my resting heart rate was about 160bpm, along with a myriad of other medical problems. I really didn't pay attention to his comment, but turns out he was right lmao "
"My gay friend was waiting outside the loo while I was urgently tampon changing-

""Do women get aroused putting a tampon in?""

I asked him if he got aroused talking a shit."
When he literally hits on you.
"I am a hospice volunteer and an end of life doula.  I became very close with one of my patients and his wife last year.  I adored them both. I promised his wife that I would be with him when he died.  I went to hospice many times a day and in the middle of many nights to assess him, hold his hand, and keep him company.  Sometimes his wife was there at the same time and we would each hold one of his hands and she would reminisce about their years together.

Eventually I knew he was going to die within a day or two.  I thought about him 24/7 because of the promise I had made to his wife.  I was terrified he would die alone.  I came in as early as I could one morning and on my way to his room asked the nurse how he was doing.  She said, ""No signs of decline, but I'll call you this evening if anything has changed.""

So I went to sit with him as usual, held his hand, and watched him breath.  He was breathing regularly, but within 5 or 10 minutes I noticed very long periods of apnea.  And just a minute or two after that, he stopped breathing and died.  It was peaceful and quiet and somehow I had gotten there just in time to keep my promise.

A couple of days later I went to his memorial service.  After I left, I stopped at the grocery store to get a Coke.  I have been looking for my husband's or my [name Cokes](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03053/coke_3053730b.jpg) for years (and to this day haven't found either), so I leaned over to check in the barrel, which was almost empty. I was astonished to see my patient's first and last names next to each other.

I am not religious or superstitious and I know that it was just a wild coincidence, but the hair on my neck stood up and my heart started to race.  It was extremely eerie."
"[Oshaberi Doubutsu](https://youtu.be/MdGTWVyu5l4). Best $10 I've ever spent. I love it, my two kids love it, everyone else who's ever played with it want one. It's just... hilarious."
"So this question is based on a recent experience with my dad - I told him I may have to have a hysterectomy in the next year (adenomyosis) and he said ""well, you're getting to be that age anyway, so it's not a big deal"" ..... I'm not sure when my dad thinks menopause happens; I'm in my 30s. "
"My college roommate expressed frustration about how wasteful it was to have to remove a tampon to pee. Her mom taught her this. She had never even tried to pee while wearing a tampon. After she tried and succeeded, she immediately called her mom who, of course, did not believe her. "
"I've been swimming for as long as I can remember, swam competitively for 9 years, and the water is really the only place I've ever felt the least bit graceful or coordinated. Out of the water I tend to be clumsy and accident prone.  

A while back one of my friends pointed out that a lot of my clumsier moments almost seem like they're caused by a lack of awareness on my part that ""air is not thick"". Like water. Which I clearly do not live in, but for some subconscious reason I must expect to create resistance between my body and my surroundings at all times, because I notice it all the time now."
"I have a brother 10 years younger than me. When he was a toddler, I'd be in charge of babysitting a lot.

One night, we were home alone in our parent's room sitting on the king sized bed with some toys. They were bouncing all about as he played and I noticed that any who strayed to the far right side of the bed were left alone, but he was still happy to chase after all the others. A small graveyard of toys began to build up on the right side of the bed so I asked him why those ones are no good anymore. 

Little Bro looks up and says, ""There's a man waiting over there.""

Me, looking over, ""No there's not.""

""Yes he is"" comes the reply. He's obviously upset by having to tell me this. Exasperated, I reach over and bring the toys back. Instead of happily taking them as a toddler might, he's still looking at the right side of the room. He's legitimately about to cry. 

Now I'm a little freaked out and some hairs are standing on end at this point, but it's up to me to keep him cool. I take him into my lap and start talking about something else to take his mind off it. Uhhhrrgg he won't take his eyes off the spot still.

Then, to my horror, his head turns and slowly follows invisible progress from the right side of the room to the left. Little Bro whispers ""He's over there now"", pointing to spot on the left his vision just rested on. ""We should go.""

Ok little man, you don't have to tell me twice! We got the heck out of there asap and went to a completely different part of the house. He doesn't remember this night, but I sure do."
"""Oh my god that guy is *shamelessly* staring at me.""

I saw him for the first time one night while leaving my friends' house they had just moved into. The neighbors were out back smoking cigarettes and one of them happened to know one of my friends so they started chit chatting, while I was waiting I felt eyes on me and looked up toward their deck to see a smallish guy with a mop of dark curly hair and a cigarette in his lips. The cherry was enough to illuminate his eyes so I could see he was looking right at me and even when I looked right back at him he didn't waver. It was hot and intimidating.  

ETA: It gives me the warm fuzzies that people enjoy our story. :D"
"I have a... sandwich dance? I never noticed until one day someone was like ""you really must like sandwiches, huh?""

Apparently I bob my head and smile while I'm chewing, like I'm listening to music only I can hear."

"The Smurfette Principle is something that shows up in a lot of shows and movies. Basically, if there's a group of characters, they all have their ""thing""-- someone's the smart one, someone's the funny one, etc. The lone female character is the girl one. The boys are individuals, and the girl is just not a boy."
"I don't have any real ambitions for a career, even though I know that's an important quality to have. I'd be happiest working a regular, low-stress hourly job, living below my means, and just enjoying the lack of stress in my life. At my last job it was all about aiming high and *""if you're not the best get the fuck out""* which I hated and had intense anxiety every morning while driving into work.

But then again, I see how people my age are now at the peak of their careers, and I'm so far from it, I just feel like a failure either direction I take. I can have the low-stress life, but be embarrassed by my lack of progress in life, or be stressed out and hate my work, but I'd be able to hold my head higher in society.

People always say: ""What would you do if you didn't have to worry about money? Whatever **that** is, is the thing you should be doing with your life."" Ummm... If money wasn't an issue, I'd want to be a hermit and live far from anyone and just sleep all day.

Ultimately, I don't think I'll ever be happy, life is all about grinning and bearing it, and trying to act like everything is okay.

"Ha, I had been holding in me pee for a while because a long meeting. When I went to pee, the force of my pee literally made my tampon shoot out of my vagina. I have been super proud of being able to do that. I hadn't been able to brag about it until now. "
"Let me preface this by saying I'm a guy, I just want to rephrase some of the advice I've seen here in a way that would have clicked for me at 20. Everyone who is talking about domestic responsibilities, taking care of yourself and your partner, etc is right, but this is what I want to focus on:

Learn how to be emotionally honest and up front while caring for, and respecting, your partner's emotions. A lot of guys do that second part by clamming up about their feelings, or prioritizing their lady's feelings above their own. **Don't do that.** 

You will end up distant and resentful, or feeling taken advantage of.

When something bothers you, you need to ask yourself why, and understand your emotions, and then bring it to your partner in a non accusatory, constructive way. When something bothers her, you need to take the time to listen and understand how she feels, not just how her feelings make you feel -- and you need her to do the same.

That base level of communication will let you address anything else in your relationship. It's important."
"""Please be normal.""

We met online, and I'd been on a first date with a guy about a week earlier who was really weird, so I was apprehensive walking into this one. Turns out that not only was he normal, he was really interesting and fun, and now we've been together 4.5 years :D "
"one of my friends told me she was sorry my parents didn't love me.

As shocking and horrible as that sounds, it made me feel much better.  Having other people tell me that my parents loved me, when every action showed they didn't, was a huge gaslight that made me unable to really figure out what was going on.  I would just *obsess*, turning things over and over, trying to figure them out.

Hearing this from her was like a lock clicking into place.  OF COURSE! That's what it was.  After that, my worldview and sense of self was much more stable, because I was not negating my own experiences for other people's wishful thinking."
"That the are heinous little monsters, that will destroy everything from furniture to shower curtains, knock over trash cans, and for some reason prefer straws to almost all of their toys, but then they look at you with the big eyes, and head butt you, curl up in your lap, snuggle with you when you sleep, and seem genuinely happy you're home. 

In all seriousness while the rest is true, my actual advice would to be to set up a small kitty fund to pay for vet bills, as it's not cheap when they get sick. "

"Don't wait for her to tell you what needs to be done before you do something. Actively seek out things that need doing and do them before she has to ask you. Have an active role in keeping the house clean, doing some shopping, and helping out with the kids.  "
When my husband and I were dating we were just done with sex when I mentioned having to pee to avoid a UTI. He was confused how that could even happen. Eventually it came out that the confusion was because he wasn't aware girls had three holes. I ended up showing him because he didn't believe me. I was laughing so hard because I thought guys not knowing that was one of those urban legend jokes.

"When I was about nine, my mother was forced to move us into a smaller house. We were going through some dark times. She had just gotten divorced, had three smaller kids to raise, and couldn't afford the house we were living in. This house couldn't be sold for some reason, so she got quite a bargain on it. We learned why.

The house had a terrible vibe. Things just happened in it all the time. Things were moved. Things were misplaced. We fought and were angry. Our pets hated it. I didn't like it.

I was especially terrified of the back porch. I guess you might call it a mudroom now. It had a few steps, that went up to a screen storm door.  The interior was about 4 ft by 6 ft. The floor was just a wooden floor that was a slight slant.  It had coat hooks a small window, and there was another door that opened to kitchen. It was a big heavy wooden door with a glass window in it probably the original door to the house. I could see in the house. The only light was a bare lightbulb with a pull string.

One day, in the middle of winter, I got home school and was the only one home. I had forgotten my key, and usually I avoided that back porch, period, but it was too cold to stay outside and starting to get dark, so the only way in was to use the spare key on the back porch. 

I tried everything get in the house without having to go on that porch. I tried to get through the windows, but they were new because they had all been replaced. I just didn't want to go to the back. I had a really bad feeling about it, but I finally got up the courage to go onto it and try to get in.

I walked up the steps and got through the screen door easily enough, but had a little trouble finding the spare key at first. I finally found it, and went to unlock the other door. This is when things got dicey. I put the key in the lock, turned it, and the door came open about 5 inches and then slammed shut hard enough that the window rattled. There was no one on the other side. I freaked out.

I tried it about five times, and whatever was holding the door just wouldn't let me in. I ran to the other door and tried to get out of it, and it wouldn't open either. That is when I started screaming/crying. 

I had to have tried both doors a thousand times. I kept running back and forth, begging to be let out. I was crying, desperate, angry, freaked out. Back and forth, back and forth, until I finally got tired and just sat down crying.

I was on that porch for an eternity. It got dark. It got really cold. I couldn't turn on the light. I just sat in the corner of the room, terrified, freezing, huddled, hoping someone was coming home. Finally the door opened on its own. I guess whatever it was had had enough fun and decided to let me go. "
"Cats do what they want.  If they are clawing up a piece of furniture, most cats don't take kindly to being punished for it.  Cats are not dogs.  They will, however, accept an offering of something better to scratch.  Our living spaces are filled with cat scratchers covered in catnip and it may look tacky, but it saves our furniture.

Cats have different purrsonalities.  It is difficult to tell what that will be when they are a kitten (will they be a cuddly angel or the spawn of satan?  Time will tell...) but easier to know when they are adults.  If you want a cuddly cat, go to the shelter and ask to meet the cuddlers.  If you want a playful cat that is similar to a dog - ask the shelter staff!  They will know who has endless energy.  

But most importantly, make sure you can **afford the vet bills** if something were to go wrong. One of our cats has needed emergency surgery to save his life from a blocked bladder twice now.  He is on prescription food for life and drinks from a kitty water fountain to keep his urinary system in tip top shape.  Cats can be expensive if something goes wrong - make sure you can afford to care for your buddy!

"I text my friend, said I wanted to sit on his face, she told him I said that and now we’re getting married :)"
"Oh man. I'm a nanny. So here goes:

- Trying to buy their love with trinkets when all the kid wants is (not even quality) time. Put down the cell phone and tell work to take a hike. Being a parent is an important job.

- Having prop kids. And by this I mean having kids because that is what everyone is doing and you need some to show off in Christmas cards so that you can successfully check them off on the checklist of having kept up with the Joneses. That's where nannies like me come in. We are hired to deal with the kids in between occasions when they are trotted out for show. So damaging. Don't do this. I cry for those children, and they cry for themselves as well. (NB: I only worked for one family in my career who had prop kids, and refuse to do it any more because I cannot handle the emotional strain of it. But every one of my professional buddies can point to one or more families they have worked for that have prop kids. It happens a lot.)

- Not putting the kiddos to bed early enough. I understand, you work until 6, 6:30 pm and a bed time of 7 pm would have you spending exactly a half hour with them in the evening in addition to the paltry 15 minutes you spend with them in the morning before going off to work. You love your children. You want to see them. And they want to see you. So you both push back bedtime to spend time together. Except, kiddo isn't served by that. I'm often complimented by my amazing abilities to get children to sleep or how surprisingly mellow the kids are the next day after I've put them to bed. You know why? I put them to bed between 7 and 7:30 pm and they need the sleep. An overtired child will have a harder time going to sleep.

- Gaslighting them. Fictions are fun and all, but the best part is when everyone knows they are involved in a fiction. As parents, you've never been there when your little one looks me in the eyes and says, ""The Easter Bunny is real because Mom says he is. And Mom would never lie to me. Right?"" That ""right?"" moment is where all their certainty in the whole world is teetering on the edge and their eyes are begging me to tell them that the person they trust above all else hasn't been abusing that trust with an outright lie, and is usually sparked because someone else (typically another child) told them the truth and has called all they've ever known into question. All because you want the Easter Bunny to be fun. Kids know Thomas the Tank Engine (substitute Elsa or any other character they are currently obsessed with) is fake but they still love him and get overjoyed. Trust me, they'll still have magical glee about the Easter Bunny (substitute Santa or the Tooth Fairy if you wish) when presented accurately. 

- Failing to show them how to have a healthy romantic relationship. Sure, you love your partner but how often do they see you flirt with your partner? I'm guessing rarely. Because we want to protect children from ""adult"" concepts. Except if they never see it then how are they going to know what is acceptable. Hug as romantic partners, kiss as romantic partners, flirt as romantic partners, console as romantic partners, and do it all in front of the kids. Then, they'll seek their own romantic partners who will follow the model they've been shown. And don't you want them to? (If you don't want your kids to have their own version of your relationship, this is your wakeup call that you might need to fix your relationship with your romantic partner. Even attending couple's therapy is a great model for children about how to fix a relationship that needs work.)

- Not letting them cry. C'mon Mom/Dad, you know the difference between a cry of disappointment, a cry of pain, a cry of hunger, a cry of frustration, and a cry of rage. Only hunger and pain need your immediate intervention. Unless you *always* want to be their crutch, you have to let the kids figure the rest out on their own. You cannot teach them how to feel disappointed any more than you can teach a blind person what the color blue is. So if it isn't a cry that needs your immediate intervention, don't immediately intervene. Observe how your little one is attempting to process the emotion and assist where necessary but keep it at the assistance level."
A classmate of mine believed that all women start menstruating during full moon at midnight. 
"I have a lot of heartache buried inside me that every once in a while just manifests itself as tears late at night. I can't help it sometimes, I just have a lot of hurt I guess I never confronted properly. Sometimes during the day, it feels like my heart got taken out of my chest for a few hours, and it's hard to feel anything at all. People see me as so happy all the time. "
"I just think of it like this: My exes are generally good people who would probably make great partners for someone else. If they were a great partner for me (and I for them), we'd still be together. 

I did sometimes doubt my decision after breaking up with someone, but I think that's just human. Even if I was the one who ended the relationship, it still takes time to get used to not having a partner anymore and to find your new normal. Given time, however, I realised that everything that happened is for the best and that it's more productive to be grateful instead. "
"I have a huge forehead.  I knew my mom did, and I know everyone says we look alike,  but I was still able to spend 25 blissful years completely oblivious to my five head. Thanks a lot Reddit. "
"I'm 46 and my partner is 23.  We started dating when he asked me out when he was 20.  At first it was really weird (this is after I realised this wasn't some crazy one night stand or Summer fling thing).  I would notice people staring all the time, my friends made all the jokes all the time.  It was really hard.  Now we're coming up to three years together and it's fantastic.  He's kind, supportive, sweet, caring, honest and deeply committed to this relationship (I should say I am very committed too).  I can truly say it's the best relationship I've been in for a very long time.  I think I came in to this with more baggage than him (clearly; I have many more years of good / bad / ugly relationships).  Things that are frustrating; financial disparity, we have to work out a balance for that.  His lack of knowledge of history - that could be as much an interest thing as an age thing though too.  His lack of understanding around ""adult"" stuff; mortgage payments, the stress of running a business and so forth - sometimes it's exhausting having to give him ""LPT crash courses"" in nearly everything.  That said he has an emotional maturity that defies his age and this makes up for any of the negatives I've just mentioned.  There is trust, honesty and calm together and we love it.  Our families are now very accepting too.  Recently on holiday in Indonesia we were reminded that there is an age gap (I think people in our city don't notice anymore) - so many ""aaahhh is he your husband or your son?"" questions from the locals.  We would smile and say husband - then the ladies would all just giggle, smile, pat my head and say oooohh you are very lucky.  We had a good laugh about it.

There is so much I could write about this relationship I am in.  But I won't.  So if anyone has any questions, please ask specifics and I'll be happy to answer."
"You can't predict a cat's personality really unless its an adult that's been in *long term* foster care in a home.

People think if they get a kitten they can ensure it turns out friendly or loves being a lap cat or plays fetch, but you can't really guarantee that. When getting an adult from a shelter, even if you look for the cat the volunteers insist will love kids and be your best friend, that may not be how it shakes out when it gets used to your home.

I used to foster for my local shelter, and I found that my foster cats didn't really relax and fully show their personalities until they were in my home for *three months*. And just because a cat acts a certain way in the shelter doesn't mean it'll be the same when you get it home.

What I mean by all of this, is that people need to know when they're getting a cat to be open to whatever cat that turns out to be. If you're set on having a buddy cat that will follow you around and sit on your lap every time you sit down, and winding up with a cat that's more timid is going to be an issue for you, you're going to have a bad time."
"This is one of those petty things that will get me on some ""sensitive SJW snowflake crybaby of the month"" list, but: stick people.

I'm talking about things like toilet signs and road signs. If you draw a stick person, that's a representation of a generic person (e.g., ""pedestrians""). But if you want to represent a woman, you put the generic ""person"" (i.e. a man) in a dress. Basically, imagine if toilet signs were ""stick person"" for ""women"" and ""stick person in tie"" for ""men"". You also see this in cartoons. A cat is a male cat; an identical cat with a pink bow is a lady cat.

Male is the ""default"", female is a modification of the ""default"". Drives me nuts when I start noticing it."
"My friend's ex thought women would come all at once like peeing. He thought it was more involuntary, so for example, you'd be in your car 'Oh shit here comes my period' then just have your entire period come at once on your car seat. "
"He had bitch face and I thought he was way too cool for me. Turns out he's a shy, sweet, giant dork who likes romantic comedies, lol. "
"My best friend once told me ""people always think you're really nice when you're not. You're just polite."" 

And it's true. I'm not an awful person or anything but people who don't know me that well (coworkers, etc) think I'm super nice and considerate when really it's just manners that my parents taught me and I keep all the not so nice stuff I'm thinking in my head."
"So many men don't understand why we have to go to the bathroom after sex. Not just the pee/UTI thing, but I had to enlighten several boyfriends that actually I'm busy scooping your spunk out of my vag. Otherwise it will splat on my inner thigh, the floor, or just ooze out unpleasantly over the next couple hours. They thought it just got absorbed up in there or some shit. "
"Honestly I'm more shocked by the ""toilet paper is cotton"" than anything else in this statement. "
"I always tease my SO for this story from when he was a kid. In grade 7 health class, he first learned about uteruses (uteri?) and periods. He had come from a very sheltered family with no sisters and he was SHOCKED that women didn't have penises too. He felt physically ill, so he abruptly left the class to go for a walk down the hall, where he promptly fainted and was attended by the school nurse. His mom was a teacher at the time and he begged the nurse not to call his mom.

Anyway so now I always give him graphic period details to see if i can make it happen again. I'll be like, "" hey babe, it looks like a knife fight took place in my underpants!..... are you okay? DO YOU FEEL DIZZY?!"" No luck so far, he's now a hardened period warrior."
"I overheard someone talking about me once, and she referred to me as ""the one with no eyebrows"".  

After she said that, I looked in the mirror and realized that my eyebrows are not blonde, as I thought, but really clear.

I color 'em in every morning now.  :-)"
"Tried twice to make file sexism complaints at work, neither time they went anywhere. Went to the dudes boss who asked the guy why he never did anything with my complaints (sexism complaints, mind you). Dude's response? ""Oh, I didn't think those were real. I thought you were just venting like women like to do""."
"I hope to be like your mum one day. In my final year of high school, everyone gets designated a meeting with the guidance counselor to make sure we were on track for what we wanted to do (i.e. if we wanna go to uni, our grades will let us probably get into our degree preferences). In my meeting, I was told to reconsider IT/engineering because I'm a girl and *will* have children, which you just can't do in STEM apparently. I should be a teacher instead, he said. He actually used the word ""career"" to describe what I *can't* do due to my fertility

I honestly didn't expect it. The way it happened was he asked ""you need to consider your gender in this too, do you know why?"" Well ""because there are scholarships and stuff for women in IT right"" I naively assumed.

Then when recounting this story during an interview for an IT job, a fellow WOMAN candidate said he had a point! Fucking hell

Edit: I also told my teacher about this and it got her riled up so I hope she said something. It's offensive to the women and men who do become teachers too. I hadn't expressed anything that would imply I'd like to teach or be with children in my career, so he must've been telling *every* girl to be a teacher"
"Haha he was very flustered and apologetic about it and was adorable, and I wasn't hurt (just very indignant) so it was hard to stay mad at him past that day. Later that week I found out we were in the same dorm (we were freshmen in college) and we ended up in the same friend group, and took Mandarin classes together. We started dating almost exactly a year after we first met (and it had been a long time coming at that point) at which point I knew he was definitely not a shithead but instead the most awesome person I've ever met. 

(He is also a much more careful driver now.)"
"A lot of weird stuff used to happen in the house where I grew up. I come from a superstitious Irish family, but my parents are atheists and I'm definitely a skeptic. As a result, I wrote off most of the weird stuff that happened in my house, but some things were truly creepy. 

We used to get answering machine messages independent of a phone call. If you scroll through the caller ID, you wouldn't see a missed call at all, just the message. There were two of these. One was a ton of distortion and static with voices in the background, almost sounded like clips from movies, but not a conversation. It was very hard to make out what any of them were saying, all I can remember understanding was an old man's voice saying ""...the worst weather..."" The distortion was weird, almost rhythmic, not like getting a pocket dial, and the sounds would change throughout the message. At the end, the distortion got very loud, drowning out the talking, and then the message cut off. That was the first one we got. 

The second message was received the same way: no missed call, just a flashing light to indicate a new voicemail. That one was short. It was about ten seconds of dead air, and then a woman very quietly saying ""I got your girl."" Its safe to say that, even being as skeptical as I am, that freaked me out. 

The other truly creepy occurrence happened when my mom was downstairs locking up. The downstairs half of my house was set up in such a way that the stairs and kitchen were in the center, and you could walk in a circle through every room. This made it easy to sneak up on unsuspecting parents, and I had done that before. So my mom is getting ready to head upstairs, and has already turned all the lights off, when I hear her call up to me. I'm just chillin in my room, probably reading Harry Potter, so I yell down ""what!"" like any 12 year old would. She calls up again ""are you down here?"" to which I said no. 

When she came up the stairs she smilingly accused me of trying to sneak up and scare her. I told her I was in my room the whole time and I don't know what she's talking about. She seemed a little freaked out by that, but brushed it off. She didn't believe me, she was convinced I was down there because, as she was walking through the dark living room, she saw a silhouette of a kid run past the sliding glass door, inside. My mom may have written it off as me playing a prank, but I know it wasn't me, and that one really scared the crap out of me. "
"I can't have combat related PTSD bc I'm a woman....you know, bc my boobs must have prevented the PTSD in the plane crash 🙄😑😒/s"
"When I was about 21, I was out at a bar alone, sitting at a table, when some guy who was a complete stranger to me just decided that he'd join me. He was incredibly pushy and rude, and I told him several times to leave me alone and that I had no interest in talking to him, refused to answer any of his questions, etc. Didn't matter. He apparently thought it was funny and kept on.

I was getting up to leave when another guy who must've overheard and saw that I was frustrated came over, greeted me as though he knew me, and introduced himself to this guy as my boyfriend. First guy immediately conceded, stating something along the lines of, ""I get it, man, that's your girl,"" before sauntering off.

Second guy seemed like a decent human being, and we ended up talking and people watching for a bit. He ended up inviting me back to his place. I was in no way interested in more than friendship, or comfortable with going to the place of someone I don't even know, and declined. He flew off the handle. He went on this entire tirade about how he had been nothing but nice to me, and I was treating him like a bad guy, and how spoiled I must be, and told me to act like an adult. (I guess saying ""no"" to things one doesn't want or isn't comfortable with instead of being pressured into doing them is childish now.)

My mind was fucking boggled. I ended up just leaving after that, and swore off bars forever."
"Holy shit, wouldn't that be nice to be that regular?"
"This immediately made me think of the episode of Project Runway when [Blake has to design underwear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bTpcvvbmuA)and he has no idea where the vagina is. At one point it comes out, that his best guess is that it's about 6 inches below the belly button. His whole piece is tragic, poor guy. "
"I've told this story before, but it's funny and relevant, so I'll tell it again. 
My ex was thanking me for going down on him when we were together. His reason for thanking me is that I had to go near where his pee came out, and that is grim, so it was very kind of me. When I replied that it was OK, and that he was near where my pee came out when he went down on me so no need to thank me so much, he was nor pleased. 
His response was to tell me that women peed out of their anus, which is why women have to sit down to pee. I spent half an hour trying to convince him that no, women have a pee hole at the front, until I ended up just getting frustrated and turning on his computer. He only believed me (about my own biology and experience about the direction that I pee!) after seeing multiple diagrams on the Internet!  "
"When I was a waitress, I had a customer slap me across the face.

The restaurant I worked at was 18 and over. A woman came to the front and said that her husband was inside and she needed to talk to him, she and her kids started to walk past me. I stopped her and said ""I'm sorry, but your children can't come inside. It's 18 and over. I'd be happy to watch them while you look for your husband.""

She FLIPPED OUT. Started screaming at me that I wanted to kidnap her children and how dare I expect her to leave her children with a stranger. She shoved me and when I stopped her again, she slapped me across the face and stormed into the restaurant with her kids in tow.

Another waitress grabbed our manager and he was a huge burley guy. He grabbed her by the arm and marched her back out side. She was screaming and pointing at me ""That bitch wanted my kids to be kidnapped!!!!! FIRE HER!!!"" I went into the kitchen at that point. My boss threw her out and threatened to call the cops.

About 20 minutes later I was helping a woman pay at the debit machine, and she said to me ""You know, you should have just let that woman in with her kids. What would be the harm, but wisdom comes with age. You'll learn those things as you get older.""

I was pissed. I was actually madder at the second woman than the nasty lady who slapped me. "
"When I was in high school, I babysat for a couple who had three kids.  The youngest at the time was only two or three months old.  They wanted to take the older two for a day out, so I stayed at their place watching the baby.

The baby had fallen asleep in the living room buckled in a carrier, so I went to the bathroom.  The bathroom opened on one side to the hall and the other side to a bedroom.  I wasn't there long, just long enough to pee, and went to leave through the hall door, where I had come in, but the door met resistance, like it was sticking.  For a second I was about to put my shoulder to the door, but something stopped me.  So instead, I left through the bedroom.

In the hall, I found the baby carrier on its side, sleeping baby still in it, wedged between the hinges of the door and the wall.  If I had forced the door open, I could have crushed the baby.

I immediately searched the entire house.  No one there, all doors closed, locked, and baby proof latched.

Never could explain the baby moving or what stopped me from slamming the door open."
"Traditionally women's tasks that men have now commodified and make so much money off of. 

Cooking is women's work, but most famous chefs and bakers are men. 

Medical care is women's work, but doctors are overwhelmingly men. 

Fashion and sewing is women's work, but famous fashion designers are frequently men. 

The same is true for beer (look up the history, it's wild), art/literature, government (running the house is a woman's job, but men get paid for doing the same things), and so on and so forth. "
"This will sound dumb but those 6' iPhone cables! Inexpensive and last forever!

"Their fingernails. UGH. 

For some men, their overall hygiene.

When a man is hitting on you and you can tell it's because he's desperate and would hit on anything that moves. There's a guy at my work like this. He'll text me and a few coworkers the same exact thing at the same exact time trying to start a conversation. Like, hello, women talk about that shit."
I love those trashy Kindle erotica novels that sell for like $2.99 or less and own at least a few hundred titles. 
"When I was a teenager, I was awoken in the middle of the night by the sound of a baby crying. I looked out my window and didnt see anything. Our neighbor had young children, so I just thought one of the kids somehow got out or something. I opened the front door and the crying got louder, like it was getting closer, but I couldn't see anything out in our yard. We had a bunch of bushes right in front of our porch so I couldn't see the whole yard, but for some reason I decided not to walk out on the porch and went to get my parents instead. I went upstairs (leaving our front door semi open, but the screen door shut-stupid to think about now) and woke my parents up. Of course my dad got up, went outside, nothing around. A cat in the street- he says ""maybe it was just the cat making noise"". But I knew for sure I heard a baby crying.


A few nights later my mom comes into my room and wakes me up. She is freaking out. She hands me this news article she printed- it's basically about how men are tape recording babies crying, and then playing them outside houses trying to lure women outside in the middle of the night.


It still freaks me out to think about 10 years later.

Edit:  Yes, I get that it ended up being a false news report type thing.  But at the time it happened to me, it wasn't known to just be an urban legend.  And when you think about it, it really would be a good way to lure someone out of their house.  
"
"That because I'm a woman, I don't even have to try at life and that I have it so much easier than men as a whole. I don't need to bother trying to find a job or getting into university because apparently I could just get married and not have to worry about anything other than ""the kids at home"". 

What bothered me wasn't even the fact that he was suggesting I could just be a housewife and ""have it easy"" (I would imagine being a housewife provides a heavy workload as well, especially if you have children)--that's fine, a lot of women are housewives and there's nothing wrong with that if that's what both you and your partner want. What bothered me was the direct assumption that because I'm a woman I wouldn't WANT to have a chance at academia or a career.

Overall, it was just a very bizarre thing to hear come out of someone's mouth in public.

"When I was young teen I had a neighborhood boy try to convince me that if a woman couldn't give birth from her vagina the doctor would have her give birth from her ass. I told him that was impossible since your colon and vagina are not connected, and dr's preform a c section when a woman cannot give birth vaginally. He insisted it was done and that his grandmother gave birth from her asshole. I told him his grandma must be medical marvel because women do not give birth from their assholes."

People always ask me how my phone ""just sticks like that"" because it's so easy to use. The magnet is surprisingly strong, but not OBNOXIOUS. I can pull my phone off easily, and it doesn't fall off when I slam on the brakes hard enough for my purse to fly off the passenger seat.

I have tried SO MANY PHONE HOLDERS and this is the best thing I've found. I hate the ones that attach to your windshield because I feel like they block my friend of vision and I don't like the ones that your phone clips into, because it's always a pain to get your phone out of it.

"Let's start with some basics. Maybe you know already, so don't be offended if you do. 

* Most cycles are approximately a month. Not all are., and it's totally normal for periods to come early or late, especially when stressed. She's probably tracking her cycle, and probably knows what is coming, and it's a good idea for you to kind of mentally know what's up as well. 
* Most cycles last 3-5 days, but the first 1-2 will be the most ""intense"" (heaviest flow, cramps, etc). Again, this varies by individual. 
* Many women experience discomfort ranging from digestive complaints, cramps, to irritability. These probably last a day, maybe two. This doesn't mean she's *irrational*, so don't dismiss her concerns just because they coincide with menstruation. It may mean, however, that her tolerance is lower because she's uncomfortable. I shouldn't need to say this (but I'm going to anyway) but don't blame all instances of her being upset on PMS/her period. 
* Some women are down for sex on their period, others aren't. Some are down to give a blowjob, but don't want you touching them. Some women can't muster up any sexual feelings at all. 
* Pads and tampons are expensive. Some women use reusable menstrual cup instead. Don't freak out if you see any of the above in the bathroom (sadly, that's a ""thing"", where men ask women to hide any evidence that periods *even exist*, because somehow unopened tampons are ""gross"".)
* Shopping for pads/tampons can be overwhelming, based on the sheer number of choices. Take a photo of what she uses on your phone and keep it for reference. Stock up a small supply in your apartment in case she gets surprised when at your place. Don't be afraid to go buy tampons/pads for her. Young men seem to believe the cashier will think they are somehow women who need these products for themselves, when in reality the cashier will either not notice/care, or correctly assume you have a woman in your life.

"A guy friend once told me that I only passed a very difficult class in college because I'm ""hot"" and ""the professor just wanted to fuck you"".

He's 53 and it's pretty obvious he can't get a woman his age because he's always dated younger women. My mom is 6 years younger, the woman he left her for is 10 years younger. That wouldn't raise any red flags alone but he routinely leaves (or cheats on them) with younger and younger women. He has expressed interest in women his own age but he doesn't pursue them or they don't give a fuck about him.

Good fucking riddance, I say, because my dad's almost the worst fucking excuse of a significant other you can have. I say almost because at least he's not abusive, or dating underage girls.

Thankfully he's never introduced them to me so I don't have to handle anything else than his stupid remarks, most of them made to my mom anyway."

"I feel as though there are really two movements going on, both of which are labeled ""fat acceptance,"" but they aren't equivalent.

I'm all for that. 

Then there's the other side of the movement, the one that ignores certain realities of carrying a great deal of additional weight. There are health risks. There are physical challenges. There are jobs a person's size may preclude them from doing. It will limit their dating options -- and no, that doesn't make people who don't want to date very fat people bigots, which is something I've read from a couple of fat activists online. 

Ultimately, people's bodies are their own to do as they please. I can only be responsible for how I behave toward others, and as long as I'm being kind and empathetic with people, I'm doing my bit to contribute to a civil society. I don't know if that makes me ""with"" or ""against.""

"ive been going to the gym for 18 years. the most important thing is to just get in there and do something. Getting hung up on a rigid schedule or routine is a recipe for failure. Some days you will have more motivation than others- and thats normal. Just walk for an hour if you arent feeling it. That being said, i put in one solid hour 5 days a week every week. Some weeks i get 6/7 days in if i find time to go on the weekend too. I do cardio every day at least 20 mins- and i lift on most days. 2 days a week i might just do cardio. im 43, fit and very healthy. life is great"

I still smoke. Never really quit. I'm just super careful about taking a shower before I leave the house. 

I enjoy the time spent in my mental world more than I enjoy the company of 99% of people in my life. 

The reason I'm so careful with money and investments isn't because I'm some ultra responsible person. It's because I know - I have known since I was young - that sooner or later, I will be so fucking sick of the bullshit working cycle of my life that I'll walk away from everything and I don't want to starve once that fragile dam finally breaks.

"My parents bought their first house when I was 4 years old, so I don't quite remember any of these details as they happened when I was between the ages of 4 and 7. I am telling them through the accounts my Mom has given.


My Dad rides motorcycles, and he would frequently go on trips with his friends to ride or go to races, which was something that never much bothered my Mom. Often, the whole family would go with him. One weekend, as my Dad was about to embark on a weekend long trip with friends, my parents got into a blow-out argument about the trip. My Mom recalls the fight as being highly unusual since they were arguing about him leaving. My Dad stepped outside, and my Mom followed him. Instantly, she recalls, they stopped arguing and felt as though a weight had been lifted off of them, almost like they were possessed to argue while in the house. They made up and he went on his trip.


While never really forgetting that ridiculous argument, my Mom was doing research about our house. She discovered that one of the previous owners, a wife and mother, was found dead in the house, at the bottom of the basement stairs. She was bludgeoned to death. The husband left that weekend to go on a fishing trip, and he says they had a huge argument about him going before he left. However, he claimed innocence. He was found not guilty, and I'm pretty sure there wasn't even a trial involved. The murderer was never found. I always hated that basement, even at four years old, I knew something was amiss.


As you would expect, my Mom was terrified at this discovery, and she recalled the odd argument she had with my Dad about his trip. She says there were other events that happened in the house for her to feel like there was something off, but she's never quite gone into much detail. They claim that while my brother and I were not home one day that she and my Dad yelled and screamed inside the house for any spirit that was there to leave, and she told it that it could go live with my Dad's Mom, my Grandmom, because ""she likes ghosts."" She says they had no other issues after that.


A little while later, my Grandmom died. She was found at the bottom of her basement steps.

"Kind of. I had a friend who thought hair was naturally straight or curly. Like if I curled my hair, it was naturally like that. Or if it was straightened by a flat iron, that a woman just brushed it that way. He had no idea what curlers, irons, and blow dryers were. "
"My hair is a mess so I chemically straighten it. My ex didn't like pin straight hair but didn't like my natural hair either. He loved pointing to celebrities or even women on the street with pretty, voluminous, loose curls and say ""see why don't you just do your hair like that?"" 
He didn't understand that we just have different hair and not every hair type can be forced into every style. "

"In high school I drove a very old S-10 truck, the mileage was capped and the power steering was awful, but that’s not all that relevant. Anyway, I went to a friend’s party(several people there) but his dad shows up, tells us all to leave and proceeds outside with everyone to watch us leave. He sees me walking to my truck and says “Wait girl! The yard is muddy better let one of these boys back that out for you”. And he never even made eye contact with me.  I was outright stunned. I rarely let people drive my truck at all much less without even asking me. 
I mean, I was a 16yr girl that was in rural Alabama (and grew up there) driving a truck older than myself but this Dad thought I was incapable of backing 10-15 feet out of muddy grass. I think that was the first time I really experienced a truly sexist  asshole. Sexual harassment happens way early and all the time, but assholes claiming we can’t fucking back out of driveway. That’s a whole other level. "

My 40 something year old husband with a MBA mentioned about a past girlfriend who must have been slutty before him since she had a loose vagina. We had to have a serious discussion about anatomy. I hate that he had that conception about her over something she can't control.

"Long before I actually got my period, I decided to figure out how to insert tampons for when I DID get my period. I was so dry that it got stuck inside me. I had to have my mom take me to the ER to get it removed. "
Same here! My ex-coworker used to call me a ninja. I said it must be my quiet shoes but I think it's from trying to be invisible in an abusive household.

":) 

We left without introducing the groups, but I was practically shaking - the kind of confidence he was radiating out was something I had never felt before. Looking back, I think our fates were sealed in that moment. 

The next time he and I saw each other it took me awhile to realize it was the same guy because he'd grown a beard (it was only a week or two later, he grows beards fast lol). I was in a relationship at the time and thus began about two years of pretending I wasn't 100% into him. Our friend groups merged into one so I saw him every weekend, sometimes during the week. Whenever we would go back to their house after a night of drinking to smoke I'd sit by him so that I could grab onto his arm when I got the spins. 

It wasn't too long after splitting from the guy I was with at the time that he and I started spending more time together, just the two of us. Something finally happened when we fell asleep on my couch watching Return of the King and the next morning when we woke up we kissed for the first time and it was one of those brain-melting kisses that you can't stop thinking about. 

It was still another year and a half before he and I actually, finally got together. Three years later and I still catch myself looking at him and feeling the same way he made me feel that first night."
"holy shit, i wonder if your ex was the dumbass on twitter who made this argument in response to people proposing lower taxes on menstrual products.

like he literally thought that women only used pads/tampons because they were spoiled princesses that couldn't hold it in until they found a toilet."
"I agree so much.

Google (and read) articles about how even with the houshold chores divided 50:50, more often than not the women are left with the emotional and organisational side of things. Like remembering it's aunt Judys birthday or getting something for your parents anniversary. Or knowing when little Peter should have his next dentist appointment or little Mary need new sneakers cause old ones are too small. Not to mention reminding you that ""it's time to mop the floors"" and ""put the clothes to the wash"". 

All of that is also a chore. At work it's normal that a small-scale manager spends say 30% of the time 'managing things' and 70% doing 'regular work'. You wouldn't expect them to pull the equal load of 'regular work' and then to the 'managing part' on their own time. Sadly that's what often happens at home, even if the guys are supergood about 'dividing everything 50:50'. "
"I have Mirena.  It was really, really unpleasant for about a minute and a half, for me, and then I was crampy for about a week and a half.

No meds other than an NSAID."

"Oh man, the way random things like that happen is super freaky (but in a good, ""there is a God or a plan or something,"" kind of way).

Before my dad died a couple years ago, one of his mantras was ""you are loved."" He'd say it to us *all* the time.  While we were trying to get stuff ready for his funeral (guest book and picture frames and whatnot) my husband pulled us an aisle over and pointed. There were four little wooden boxes with ""You are loved,"" painted on them. One for each of his kids and one for his wife. Broke down in the middle of the store. But the phrase is pretty common and this was a major arts and crafts store, so it was a weird coincidence, but not super crazy. 

*This* one is crazy. 

I saw a thread on reddit where OP was grieving and I shared a story about my dad and a really meaningful gift he'd given me. I immediately got a reply that said only ""You are loved."" I was *shocked*. But then I thought, ""maybe they know me???"" So I checked out their comment history. It was a bot that randomly selected one comment reddit-wide every few seconds and left that comment a random compliment. So this bot randomly selected not just my comment, but the one comment where I shared a touching story about one of my dad's ""things,"" and *then* it randomly selected a compliment that was super meaningful to my dad and our family. It honestly felt like my dad's spirit commandeered a reddit bot to tell me ""hey."" 

It still gives me chills. The sheer astronomical odds of that happening the way it did astound me.

*Here you go...*

""This happened in my junior year of high school. 

One evening, my mother and stepfather had gone out to some event, maybe it was an extended dinner or a concert, it's hard to remember. I had stayed at home to work on a paper that was due the next day (I was one of those kids who procrastinated until the last minute) and spent the whole night working at the desk in my room. To give you a picture of the room, my desk faces a wall and sits next to a small window that's on the same wall, and from where I sit, my back faces my doorway. While I was working, I was wearing these great headphones that I had gotten for my birthday — the kind that are noise canceling.

My parents left the house around 6:00 PM, and the whole time they were gone, I sat at my desk, blasting music through my headphones and writing my essay. Occasionally, I would take breaks and watch the rain and lightning outside my window (we lived in Houston at the time and there was a big storm that night). I never left my desk.

My parents returned around 11:00 PM. At some point late late in the evening, I had removed my headphones, so when my parents came home (coincidentally just a few minutes after I had taken off my headphones), I clearly heard the garage door open and my parents open the door to the house. Seconds after I hear them enter, I hear my mother shout my name. ""Adrian!"" she screams, ""what on earth happened in here!?"" Confused, I get out of my chair and start walking through the house to them. There's only a small hallway that separates my room from the living room. Due to my rush to figure out why my mother was yelling, I paid little attention to the hall and the house. After a few moments, I get to my parents. My mom looks livid. She's pointing at the carpet floor yelling, ""Was this you!? Did you have friends over!?"" I look down. The carpet is ruined. It's covered in muddy footprints.

I frantically explain to her that I have no idea how those got there, that I spent the whole night at my desk working on my paper. I watch as her face goes from anger, to confusion, to fear. We realize that someone else must have entered the house. Quickly we scan the footprints, trying to make sense of the situation. It only takes us a few moments to figure out where they start: our back door, which we usually left unlocked. Then we noticed something else. The footprints started at the backdoor, but there were no footprints exiting the back door.

We hear something pounding through our house. We hear the front door get torn open, then slammed shut with a sharp WHAM!

We all run into the garage and lock the door. My mom starts shouting at the police through the phone, ""Please come quickly! Someone's broken into our house!"" After what seems like hours, the police arrive. An officer stays with us in the garage as his partner goes through the house room by room. His partner tells us that it's safe to go back in, that there's no one in the house. Then she asks us a question. She asks us whose room is down the hall to the left. My parents look at me and I tell the officer that it's mine. She asks us to follow her down the hall.

As we go, it's easy to see that the footprints weave through my house from the back door. They go through the living room, through the small hallway, into my parents room (which is down the hall to the right) and then turn around towards my room. They stop in my doorway.

Then the officer points at my door, which I had left open the whole night. On it, in black sharpie, was written the following:

My Log

8:47: I see you

8:53: You forgot to lock the back door

8:59: You seem focused

9:24: Turn around

9:47: Look at me

10:15: Look at me

10:37: Look at me

10:49: Look at me

For nearly two hours, someone stood in my doorway watching me. To this day, I shutter to think about what would have happened if I had ever turned around and looked at them."""
"It's not spooky as much as unexplainable I guess. I've kept it to myself for the most part to avoid sounding crazy, but when I was about 11, in the middle of a completely normal school day, I had my first bout of anxiety or some kind of panic attack. Now I had been anxious my whole life, but this was different. I walked straight to the office and asked to call my dad. I told him, ""please come get me because grandpa is going to die."" I had no idea why I said it, and no idea why I thought anything was wrong with my grandpa. 

Surprisingly enough though, he picked me up right away. A few hours later, we got a call from the nursing home that his stable condition had suddenly deteriorated and he passed away. 

This feeling in my gut has only happened two other times in my life: the night my grandma fell (which led to her death shortly after), and one night I went to a store I felt anxious about taking my purse inside. It was the only time I'd ever left it in the car, and I had actually walked away from the car and then turned around to put it back in the car, all without really knowing why. As we walked back outside to leave, we were robbed by 3 men who ran up behind us and spun us around and immediately took my friends purse and ran off. 

The only real spooky event I've experienced was pretty tame. I was folding some clothes, watching tv. The channel suddenly changes, so I look around for the remote I must have just sat on or something. 

It's on a table across the room. I go get it and hit the 'info' button to see what channel was on - it was on the Syfy channel (that we don't ever watch) and the show playing was called 'Paranormal witness.' "
"So I'm actually the younger one, but my girlfriend and I are 11 years apart. And, honestly? I almost never think about the age difference. The only time it really comes up is pop culture references - she's always making jokes that leave me staring blankly because it's from a film that came out before I was born.
Big age differences matter less than being at a similar point in your life, in my opinion. Our relationship is goofy and fun, but grounded. I don't think that's any different than a relationship with a much smaller differential."
"One time apparently I was drunk and I placed a late-night Amazon order. A few days later, I came home to a package and I had no idea where it came from. 
It was a swirling colorful party light. I got so stoked and I used it all the time for years. I feel like past me was a bro to present me for that one. 

I had literally never thought about buying one before, so it was completely random. Seriously changed my life/dance parties, though. "

"Ice queen. 


If they say something creepy you say ""that's rude""

If they get touchy feely you grimace, move away from their touch and say ""don't touch me""

If they start trying to break down your barriers my fall back and ""final move"" is ""you really don't understand basic social etiquette do you?"" 


Any time they do anything appropriate say these things with a very stern and serious face and immediately walk away. You get the grand and beautiful title of ""bitch"""
"I have an uncle like that.  Its none of my business but yah I do think it's kinda icky - we live in a society that is sexist, objectifying, misogynistic etc to women, and still values women primarily for their youth, beauty, and ability to be 'fuckable'  so yah, it does feel like my uncle is playing into that whole mess.

And when I was like 11 my uncle would tell me what a beautiful ittle girl I was growing into  - around his friends like at a backyard bbq.  IT's hard to describe but it felt like he was doing it in a suggestive way and made me feel sad and scared and gross."
"Why is it that some people's default setting is that women must be wrong?

It's really hard to be kind when people's first assumption is that women don't know their own bodies. 

It's not hard to be kind when a person has a question, is open minded enough to seek out an answer, and accepts women's experiences as valid. "
"I worked as a server in college.

Drunk dude came in with his friend, verified that I was over 18, handed his belt across the table to his friend, tried to drag me to the bathroom. I stabbed him in the arm with a fork off a nearby table and quit the next day. "
"One of my cats, my 17-year-old, does this thing with our little mouse toys. (And *only* the little fuzzy mice. She shows no interest in any other toys.) 

About three to four times in a 24-hour cycle, and at fairly regular times (usually 4 a.m., 11 a.m., 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.), she jumps up from wherever she is sleeping, goes and finds a mouse toy, and then stands over it meowing very loudly. It's a really specific meow, like myow! myow! myow-WOW, myow-WOWWWWW. 

After a few minutes of that, she'll bat it around a bit (meowing the whole time) then she'll pick it up in her mouth and run around the condo with it making *very urgent and panicked meows* until she drops it in her chosen spot; usually the landing, in front of the couch, in the laundry or on the bed. 

We take terrible joy in observing how mice migrate across our condo throughout the day, whether we're there or not. Sometimes she tries out a new spot to drop it, including our shoes and our bathmat. 

What's funny to me is that it's just so regular and so specific. She doesn't play with any other toys. 

The time varies -- sometimes an especially vigorous mousing session will go on for 15 minutes. Other times she just hops off the bed, gives a few meow-WOWs, and then quickly brings the mouse up onto the bed. 

But the basic procedure is the same. I've had a lot of cats and none have quite been so regular in their behaviour. "
"Posted this in askreddit before, but I'm going camping again this weekend, so it's playing on my mind.


Went camping with my bf when I was 19. We weren't in a designated camping site, just out in the wilderness of Northern Scotland. Apart from the midges we hadn't seen another organism for nearly a day. We had a fun evening drinking and watching the stars, fucking under nature's canopy etc.


He fell asleep before me cause he's a lightweight. I was just chilling in the tent using a torch to read my book when all of a sudden the roof just starts bowing inwards. It came down 2/3 feet to the point where I had to lie down so it didn't touch me. I was still pretty wasted, but I'm sure I saw 10 points pressing in right above my face, like someone was pushing it down with their hands. I was full of rum at the time, and I'm a certified scouser, so I went outside with my torch and a knife in full on 'lets-be-having-you' mode, but there was no-one to be seen. I was scared shitless for the rest of the night."
"I wear very modest clothing. I have poor-ish body image so it's almost always jeans and a dress shirt for work. I am a B cup and never show off cleavage. I asked some guys on my team and one girl to help me move. They helped. 

You should tell that guy not every guy needs a sexual exchange to do something nice. "
"I was in the army, in basic training and we were doing a navigation course in the woods, they give you a compass and a map and a team of a few people and you have to make it to certain checkpoints and mark them on the map in an allotted time. My assigned MOS at the time was navigation related, so as the only person in my company with that MOS I was excited for this course/challenge and was assigned my team. We worked together and ended up lost. I explained to my male teammates that I had a knack for this and could help if they would let me see the map and compass and protractor so I could get us to this checkpoint and win the challenge. I really really wanted to be the first group to get back to the starting area with the shortest time and all the checkpoints correct for the drill sergeants to check. After much skirting around the subject of me seeing the map and tools, one of the guys (seeing my confusion and frustration) blurted out ""YOU'RE A WOMAN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO HELP JUST DROP IT."" And then it dawned on me that every one of my teammates had no confidence in my ability or intelligence solely on the basis that I am a woman. To this day this memory enrages me. I felt so put on the spot that I was silent for the rest of the day, I never brought it back up because I didn't know what to do, there wasn't really anything I could do. They ended up missing one of the checkpoints and I was able to figure out what went wrong once the drill sergeant went over the map with us, but we could have come out on top if my group hadn't been misogynistic assholes and just let me do what the military literally selected me to do. Wtf. "
"You can be the best person in the whole world, but if you aren't mature enough for a relationship no skills, habits or qualities will make you eligible. Let me explain: 

I met this great guy that I dated for a year and a half, he was a real gentlemen, always carried the backpack, the heavy stuff, was amazing in bed, made me feel comfortable in my skin, never said anything bad about my body, knew how to cook and did house chores at home pretty often, was there for me when I needed him, we had a lot of things in common, we had same beliefs, we were on the same page about the future,... But then the honeymoon phase was over and he thought relationships don't need any work to work. But they do. They need a fuck ton of work. We started to grew apart, he noticed, but didn't think it's necessary to deal with that as he believes that if it's meant to be it's going to work out no matter what. He also met another girl he got along with really well and told me that that should never happen if he really loved me (something along these lines!). But if you think about it, there's probably a few thousand people walking on this planet that are compatible with you and you're going to meet at least some of them and if you're in a relationship at the time that is going great, you should be mature enough to recognise that leaving someone because you met somebody else that you get along with is a very shitty thing to do. Especially if the relationship has no problems. I think you get the point of my rant...

So my advice is, be mature, learn how to deal with problems, learn to communicate your feelings, show your partner that you're trust worthy, be a team (it's both of you against the problem not you against her), when a problem arises think how to solve it, don't think about how bad the problem is, talk about your needs and her needs and meet in the middle of there's no other way, talk about your expectations, respect each other and be each others friends.

And don't fucking take anything for granted in the relationship. Nothing sucks more than being taken for granted, even if she makes dinner every night of the week, thank her for doing that.

"When I was about three years old I was (coincidentally) in my parents room one day playing and doing kid things with my mom and my brother. As my mom tells it, I was drawing pictures and suddenly in a very matter-of-fact but serious tone I stopped what I was doing and said: ""When I was an old man I had many grandchildren and used to love playing with them."" 22 years later I have no recollection of being an old man or ever having grandchildren but it really makes me think because IMO kids under the age of 5 are [far too young to make up things about a past life.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5833737-soul-survivor) I get plenty of deja vu still for some *really* specific things but who knows what we don't know if anything supernatural is remotely a real thing.

"OK so I can see where this might have come from, I think he misunderstood a joke his grandma made in passing or maybe a running family joke about the story of the birth of one of the kids. Bless his poor grandmother. She probably tore straight through her perineum and and into her asshole, and decades later joked about the baby that came out her asshole (sort of) instead of her vagina.

"A friend of mine played golf all through high school and played on a D2 college team. About a year after graduating college she decided it was time to buy a new driver and went to a certain major sporting good store in North America. 

She had a good idea of what driver she wanted to get, but needed to hit a demo of the club a few times to confirm her choice. She told the store associate what driver she was looking to demo and purchase that day. He took one look at her and told her she needed to go take a few beginner golf lessons first before he wasted his time."

Recently one bookstore turned every book written by a male author backwards on its shelf to show how most published authors are men.

"Not my dad, but my grandfather. I am definitely not cool with it, and neither is my mom. He was a pretty standard dad (my mom says) and a great grandfather until a few years after he divorced my gramma. It started with him dating girls the same age as my mom then kept getting younger. I shit you not, he now owns a bar/ strip club and pimps off his girls. He's in his late 60s, dating a 19 year old. I'm 22. 
After he moved across the world he would send messages on FB. One time he came back and had dinner and brought his 25 yo girlfriend. We tried being okay because he seemed happy and we kinda just wanted him to come back and to see him more. Then he eventually stopped sending messages and stopped replying, even to my mom. He started posting more and more about his bar and all the young women he was with, so I blocked him. Now we have absolutely no contact and I'm fine with it, but I know it fucks with my mom. "

This happens to me all the time (bad allergies). Also when I started lifting weights...I've shot out tampons while squatting on multiple occasions.
"I ask permission in life all the time -__-

"We have. She said, ""well, I mean, I have to love you, you're my child, I just don't like you."" 

My understanding is, she was stuck in the hospital for a month before I was born, on drugs to keep her from going into early labor, except she still did too early, like, way early, and I was this tiny little premie that was probably going to die. They whisked me away before she even got to hold me, and put me in this little glass cube, and kept me for over a month.

She had a one-year-old at home already, and he was one of those fussy babies that always needed something. Allergic to milk, and colicky, and never slept through a night, and all that. And then I came home, and I was already sleeping overnight, and I ate on a regular schedule, and I never fussed. 

I was a neat child, who always did their chores and homework, and behaved, and my other siblings are wild, like my mother was. They throw fits, and fuss, and I never have. My mother says the terrible part of my terrible twos was that I wouldn't stop asking questions. I wanted to know everything. From the second I started talking to now, she says, she hadn't understood a word I've said, and I've always followed the rules.  

She thought I was a dumb kid, because I was so obedient, that I made up words - because I would use big words she didn't know, that I'd read in books, and she just thought I was making crap up - until a teacher asked her about testing me for the Gifted program. Even then, she laughed at the teacher and insisted she was asking about the wrong kid. She eventually agreed to letting me be tested, but she thought it was a huge waste of time. She did not believe for even a second I'd get in, and then I did. And I was so many things that my siblings were not, and she was not. I didn't fit.  I don't fit.

Even now, she thinks it's some joke, and she'll look at me like she doesn't understand what or who I am, how I came to be. I'm her kid, but she doesn't get me, at all. Who and what I am confuses her. How I am. And she doesn't like it. I am the kids she picked on in high school, you know? I'm not a beauty queen, or a cheerleader, or any of those things she wanted for me. I wasn't popular, or particularly pretty, no matter how much she wanted that to be me. 

But at least now, she's able to say all that. She's able to admit it. I don't have to feel like I'm secretly doing something wrong or just making it all up. 

And it's kinda funny, because I always tried so hard to be perfect so she'd like me.  I took care of my responsibilities so I'd never upset her. I followed every rule she gave me. I behaved so well, thinking it would help. Hoping if I was good enough, she'd love me."

"*That's*  interesting.    

I was a teacher in a trade school and he was a student.   
I remember actually schooching up to him to talk and make sure he had nice teeth as that is kind of a dealbreaker for me.    
During the months of classes I noted his extreme patience and heard things about how well he looked after his parents and both of those qualities influenced my opinion of him a lot.   

I did not initiate any sort of relationship until after he graduated- the night of his class graduation party was when when I made my move  :)

"I was talking to a stranger in an auto-shop, waiting for them to do a brake fluid flush and oil change. I got to talking to this 70 year old guy about real estate costs in our area and how millennials will struggle to ever own a home.

I make a good middle class salary especially for my age and I said ""there's a good chance I will make more than my husband"" and he says ""ohhh you don't want to do that. My daughters husband makes less than her and they fight about it all the time."" 

So apparently the solution to my financial problems are to STOP working my high paying job and marry a man who has an even higher paying one. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"I don't wear tampons for a number of reasons but the times I have tried them out, peeing with a tampon in was a pretty unpleasant experience for me. The pee always ends up running down the string, so why would I want to put that back in my underwear? And then half the time, contracting the muscles to start peeing ends up pushing the tampon out anyways."
"Just for the record, this is not the stupidest question asked on this sub. Not even top 10.

1. [My quilted mattress topper.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MV1DB6Q/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_sOXYzbP02VMC9) I trusted the reviews on this one and omg my bed is the comfiest thing ever now. 

2. [Comfy tank dress](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071S51R3M/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_lPXYzb5W9NRCH)  with pockets! I got it in black and it's super versatile to layer with and dress up or down. 

3. [Acrylic three drawer makeup organizer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004KKXA58/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_OQXYzbMY8R851) to keep my makeup from covering every surface in my room! "
"Gay bars, dating apps with ""bi"" stated explicitly in my profile, and dressing a bit more masc when I'm out in the wild. 

This last one is my favorite - women look at you a bit differently when you're dressed in a less typically femme fashion (which I totally do all the time, but am finding myself drawn more and more to a slightly masc aesthetic). It's pretty easy then to make eye contact and gauge attraction. Doesn't hurt to flirt a bit heavily. If they're interested, they usually escalate the flirtation. If they're straight/not interested, they're usually flattered and you can keep having a regular conversation and no harm done. 

Dropping hints (or explicit references) towards your sexuality helps too. I'll make some comment about an actress I'm attracted to or something like that pretty early on in a conversation. Another good one is ""dude, I used to see this girl who [insert thing the other person just mentioned they do].""

Once it's obvious you're attracted to women, they'll mention it too. Usually works pretty quickly. 

(This sounds like I go around picking up women all the time but I just like to flirt lol)"
"I bought a countertop egg cooker.  I felt bougie as hell buying a ""one-use"" kitchen item, especially since I *can* make hardboiled eggs on the stove.

No, it's amazing! You pour a little water in, set up the eggs, push a button and let it go.  The eggs are steamed, shells come off easily, it turns itself off.  I have hardboiled eggs whenever I want them.  I do r/keto, so it helps.  I've become an evangelist, to the point where 2 coworkers have purchased egg cookers, too.  (And they both love 'em!)"
I believe this is also true for chefs and probably many other hobbies that people can turn into careers.

"As a child my family lived in an old house, an elderly lady had died there. Whenever things would happen it was just Ms S's ghost. Things like windows and door opening and closing, floors squeaking. The creepiest thing. When I was very young, 4ish I shared a room with my sisters. My bed was by the window. I woke up one night and saw a dark figure standing at the foot of my bed. I was so scared I just looked at it until it was gone. I don't remember talking about it. Here's the creepy part. A few years ago my sister told a story where she saw a dark figure at the foot my bed, when I was about 4. 

As a teenager I went to boarding school. The building was an old hospital. I lived in the heart attach ward. One weekend day I came home from a soccer tournament. I was tired so I went to bed early and my roommate went to the lounge. I woke up to a child's voice saying ""turn your light on"" I said ""no. just turn on the overhead"" thinking it was my roommate. Again, a child's voice ""turn your light on"" So I sat up and turned my light on. No one was there. I ran to the lounged to get my roommate. The bathroom door would open all the time. We thought it was because we hadn't latched it. NOPE. We would push on that door so hard, then it would still open. I was always scared to be in that room alone. "

If I ask him more than 15 minutes before bed, he ""still has plenty of time it'll get done, geez"" but if its any later he insists that I should have told him earlier and that he's too tired or it is too late. It drives me nuts to have to act like I'm his mother...."

"My dog (11 year old Poodle) has a looong list of very dumb, weird habits but one of the main ones is he WILL NOT EAT unless there is someone watching him as he does. 

Once we had a two-day trip and left him at home. We fed him at 5 am (and watched him eat) and then left him another portion of food just in case. That night the jerk who was supposed to petsit flaked on us (SO INFURIATING!!) and thus he was alone that night, but at least had extra food right? 

The next day we hurried home but it was an 8-hour drive and got there in the late afternoon. Dog comes all excited to say hi, then starts barking and running to his food bowl. The dummy had not eaten in TWO DAYS just because there was no one to watch him eat the food. 

My poor, dumb baby :( Thank god he's pretty because he's got absolutely no self-preservation instincts"
"Same here! It's both a curse and a blessing. People can tell when I'm being genuine and trust me more because of it, but people can always tell when I'm ticked off, upset, etc. even for the slightest second. Sometimes emotions flit by in my head without me even registering, but they're written all over my face"
"The Bible is incredibly sexist. It was written in a time when that was the norm, and the people who demand that the Bible be interpreted literally and at its word as the divine inspiration of God are the people who continue to perpetuate these outdated, old fashioned, sexist beliefs. Examples: all the stigma around female purity, male/female segregation in places of worship or forbidding women from positions of leadership, Pence's ridiculous rule of not eating dinner with a female colleague, etc..."
"I work 70 hours a week. My partner doesn't work and has been a complete jerk to me lately. I don't have the emotional energy to deal with him so I've been pretty curt as opposed to arguing or playing into any disagreements. 

The other day he messaged one of my close friends that he was concerned about DEMONIC ENTITIES IN MY HOME THAT WERE AFFECTING MY MOOD. 

Are you fucking kidding me. I am pissed that you leave food I bought on the counter to rot and cannot seem to clean up after yourself. There are no demonic fucking entities in my house. *raaaage*"
"Lately? I just see so much over-programming of kids' activities and helicopter parenting. 

I think a lot of the most important things for a child's development come down to free time to just explore being a kid. Kids need that free, unstructured time to develop independence and confidence in interacting with the world on their own terms. 

They do not need their entire lives planned out to the minute and stuffed with classes and sports and extracurriculars. Support the kid's interests as you are able; but dear God, allow them some time to just be kids and figure life and themselves out. A lot of really important learning happens during unstructured time. 

Oh, and one more thing: constantly catering to young children's desires on food, particularly on what society codifies as ""kid food."" You know: chicken fingers, fries, pizza. It seems to set really unhealthy dietary habits for later on in life. 

I see so many adult ""picky eaters"" who, well into their 30s now, will only eat chicken fingers, fries and pizza or whatever. And it almost always traces back to.... that's what they ate as a kid, and their parents constantly gave into it because it was easier than pushing them to try new things. 

I was kinda like that too, well into my 20s, and my parents were like that too. Luckily I managed to push myself to break out of it and now enjoy a much wider variety. "
Nah. My boss gracefully took over and everyone working here was glaring lasers at him. Assholes aren't tolerated here. 
"We had two cats and dog. They would sleep on my bed together when we weren't home. They wouldn't go near the back porch either. There was a bathroom right next to the back porch, and they wouldn't go in it either. 

We had to move the litter box to the upstairs bathroom which was added on and brand new, because we had it in the basement, but they wouldn't go to the basement.

The garage wasn't attached. It was in the backyard. We didn't use it because it didn't have a garage door opener and it was locked. One time, we left the pets in the house and came home and the dog was missing. We went looking for him for a long time and couldn't find him. We had know idea how he had gotten out. A day later we found him in the garage. Now someone could have put im in there, but I don't know how the got the garage door open because it was still locked."
"Started internship. Boss showed me to desk and asked me if I knew how to turn on my computer. I said yes. He said ""Huh, most women I have to show how to do that.""

Internship went downhill from there. "
"Definitely not the worst compared to some of the other ones here, but at work the other day I got into a casual conversation with a male customer about movies. We were talking about westerns and he started to say something about The Hateful Eight but stopped himself because ""maybe someone like me wouldn't be comfortable with all the blood in it."" 

Pretty harmless on the surface, but I hate this stereotype that girls find blood icky considering one 12 year old girl sees more blood in one month than an adult male will see in his entire lifetime.

And to top it all off he misidentified the director and the composer for the movie. "

It hadn't occurred to me prior that my mother not liking me wasn't just all in my head, since everyone talked about how amazing my mother was, and how great a parent she was, raising six kids as a single parent, and nobody ever indicated in any way that they were all aware that she simply did not like me."

Train your cats from an early age to accept nail trimming. It's not hard to train cats, contrary to popular belief--you just need to be slow, calm, quiet, and gentle, and offer good rewards for good behavior. Regularly trimmed nails = no destroyed furniture and no scratches all over you.

Cats are the best pets. I adore them. Way better than dogs, IMO. I don't dislike dogs, but they're like having children--so damn needy, ugh. Cats are like having adult housemates."

"I am a union electrician. I get all kinds of crap each day at work. Never from my own crew though. Always plumbers and carpenters asking, 'What made a petite gal like you want to do something like this?' .... the paycheck, benefits, and retirement... same as you. 

Or they offer to carry a 6 foot ladder or a box of cable or something equally easy. I once got asked if I was capable of driving a lift... since I'm a lady. 

Catcalling happens, but not more than once per guy. I shut that shit down and quick. I usually try to objectify those petty men in return if they don't quit. They get all confused and don't understand, it's quite satisfying.

"In a week, we are going to New York for a wedding. In itself, that's not really a problem. It's just that we've already spent literally thousands of dollars with lodging, a rental car (it's not in the city), flights, etc. I'm not looking forward to it for various reasons, and feel like a brat and a downer for the way that I feel about this.

I know that, as people spread out and move around, attending weddings will become more and more of a travel-intensive and expensive thing, and I'll get happy by next week, but for now, I'm just feeling mopey and annoyed about the whole thing"
"I used to let my ex punch me while we were having sex. I am disgusted with myself that I let him do it because I never wanted it, I just didn't want to say no."

This is amazing. 
"I’m 45 and my husband is 33. Honestly, I never think about our ages anymore. In the beginning of our relationship (4 years ago) I was very insecure because I was done having children (per my doctor) and I knew he always thought he would have at least one biological child. Then I went on a diet, lost weight, my health improved and on my 43 rd birthday I got the surprise of my life and found out I was expecting. 2.5 years later we have a two year old son. I used to always feel like he had more energy than me but now we’re both exhausted. But so happy. "
This dude is way too picky. Glad he is an ex

"I worked at wendys for a year. One night around 9 a couple came in and got a ton of stuff, asking for it all made fresh. The girl got 20 nuggets with cheese sauce and called herself a pig. They went to a table and ate, no problems. 

After they left I went to clean the table and there was cheese sauce and chili spread all over the table. Half eaten chicken nuggets everywhere. Napkins thrown everywhere, including the floor. With that many Napkins, they could have cleaned up their mess. The girl was right. She is a pig. "

HOW DO YOU NOT FEEL EVERYTHING HAPPENING FROM THREE DIFFERENT HOLES????. 
"Thanks, girl! It really makes me sad that pads get so hated on and shamed. I'm sure there are a lot of women walking around uncomfortable because they feel like they aren't allowed to use ""uncool"" pads. Wear what's comfortable! I do understand some complaints about pads, like that they feel like a diaper (I have legit gotten diaper rash from wearing certain extra-heavy, exta-long overnight pads during active hours) but for me, usually the feeling of wearing a pad ""disappears"" in a way that wearing a tampon never does (but so many women contend tampons ""disappear for them). In the end it just baffles me when I'm told it must be because there is something wrong with me, or my body, or the way I'm putting them in, when the perfectly reasonable explanation of ""different vaginas"" is so obvious."
"For that, I typically find a friend or family member with a sharp stick does fine."

"My friend's dad married an 18 year old when she was 18. Then when friend was 20, he married another 18 year old. He's not even remotely attractively so idk how he's getting all these pretty young girls.  My friend has a lot of issues with men. She has moved or has planned to move to many different states to live near men after like 2 dates. It's sad. "
"- That I have a nervous giggle (i.e. laugh at the end of sentences). I can't hear it, it's weird. It's like my brain just filters out that sound. I can hear it on recordings of me and because people have told me about it, but I can't hear it myself or feel when I do it.

- That I didn't know which emotions I was feeling/didn't talk about emotions at all. Pointed out by a therapist. When she asked how I felt I would either tell her my physical sensations (tired/cold/hungry); or I would answer with my thoughts (""I feel that other people might be angry with me"", rather than 'anxiety' or 'sad' or 'angry' etc.)

- That I didn't tell other people about the things that were happening to me in my private life. Pointed out to me by a friend who I went to school with once we were adults. A lot of bad stuff happened when I was a teenager. I would, as an adult, occasionally refer to it thinking I probably told her about it at the time, but every single time she would say: ""You didn't tell anyone about that"". I didn't notice at the time. I guess it didn't occur to me to say!

- That I 'blank out'/go quiet when I'm under stress or am emotional. My friend told me I just stop talking/go silent/stare at a wall. Again, I have never noticed that I do this, it's completely unconscious. My friend actually only told me about it recently because she had noticed I do it less since I've been in therapy and I was like: I *do* that?! I have never noticed that."
Found the little mermaid. 
We lived there for another two years. It was such a horrible place. I don't have single good memory from that place. I think we just kind of abandoned it. It was in the same neighborhood that we lived in until I was 18. I just avoided it completely.
"Myself.
  
I can't get myself to do my work. I try and try, but I just stare at the screen. It must take me 3 times as long to do anything as any person I've ever met. I've tried everything - I work out to keep time away from the screen and to relax, I listen to classical music to concentrate, I drink tea instead of coffee, I eat balanced meals, I keep to a routine, I try to get excited about my work, I sleep the same amount every night, I research ""time management skills,"" I do the pomodoro technique, I deactivate facebook and log out of twitter and reddit, and I KNOW how to do my work - I went to college for this.
  
 But my mind just wanders and then I lose the time. I can't seem to do it. and I wonder if I ever fucking could? Do I even have the brain capacity to do anything high level at all?"

"&gt;  cats didn't really relax and fully show their personalities until they were in my home for three months

I got a kitty in late June and this has been my experience. She is just now, I'd say, FULLY comfortable. It takes time with cats, and you can't rush it. Don't be like Elmira from Tiny Toons and try to make cats cuddly or comfortable, they do it on their own time. In fact, that's one of my favorite things about cats is how rewarding it is to earn their affection, but I digress"
Yup! Just like we get aroused when getting a Pap smear. 
"How often, without even thinking about it, derogatory gendered euphemisms are used to say that another guy's behaviors or attitudes are seen as weak. ""That's a B - - - - move."" or ""C'mon, don't be such a p - - - -.""

"There is a whole r/incel community who believes that women store all the sperm that has ever been released into their vagina and absorb it into the vaginal walls.

"I hate a lot. Everything, everyone, I just do.

It's... a huge commitment that's messy to get out of should things go south.
"I worked food service at a little Asian take-away place. Our worst customer was actually a group of three elderly people who, for some reason, came in nearly everyday. They were always abrasive, always complaining, always expecting something for free. 

On one occasion, they came in and argued with my coworker about wanting to use a coupon they had already used, which made it invalid. We had been warned about them by our manager, and explicitly told not to accept the coupon, but of course he was not at work. 

They basically berated my coworker relay style: one called her stupid, another piped up from behind that she's pissing her off, the third starts in about how easy this job is. The whole time she's keeping her composure and calmly explaining she can't take the coupon, but her eyes are filling with tears at this point. I took over and called the manager who said not to accept the coupon. They're not happy, but they order. 

All three of them are aggressively telling us that the man is allergic to onions, there better not be onions in his fried rice! So we make new fried rice, special for this guy, who is apparently deathly allergic to onions. The whole time, we are compliant, not copping an attitude, being professional, but they're still all but actually yelling at us. The man says ""if there are onions and I die on this floor my wife will sue you!"" 

Obviously this order is taking a bit longer, we have to make all the sides sans onion, and of course they're complaining. So we explain that we're making the mixed veggies now, making sure there's no onion, and he just goes ""oh I just pick those out and give them to my wife."" 

So, on top of it all, this guy is *not* deathly allergic to onions, he just doesn't like them I'm guessing. They were THE WORST and they ALWAYS came back. It was like a nightmare that repeated itself daily. "
"I work EMS, that's pretty common with women partners.

Once, the nurse at the hospital walked right by my (paramedic) partner and asked me for a report (I'm only an EMT, as marked on my clothes in many places). I just pointed to the paramedic who was trying to hand her tons of paperwork. "

"I've had so many men ask me why I work and get ""why don't you let your husband take care of you?"" type of comments. Also had my career equated to a hobby that gets me out of the house, all sorts of nonsense like that. Whatever, I'm the boss, so they can all kiss my ass!"

"I've never really ""dated"". I had a ""relationship"" in high school, but that was basically holding hands and then we never talked again.

I'm basically a human ball of anxiety and self-loathing. Not exactly great relationship material.

I don't know that it's really affected my life at all. I just kind of  do my thing."
"When we first started dating, my sweet and innocent SO would hold out on me during the week I took the sugar pills in the birth control pack. He thought because it was a bleed week, I could get pregnant because I wasn't taking birth control. I explained about hormone build up, and he didn't believe me. I had to get him a birth control pill pamphlet before he believed me."
"I had to pee really badly in a drive in movie with my ex, and he was like ""aren't you on your period? Doesn't the tampon just hold it in? Or couldn't it absorb it?"" 
I ruined the movie experience for everyone by laughing my ass of and then explained that I pee from a different hole. "
"As in, an Allen key? Like that's not even a ""being handy"" or   an unusual hobby related thing, that's just basic af common sense. Like do you know how to use a screwdriver? "
"It wasn't a rule it was a law. If I was caught allowing minors on the property, it meant a $750 fine to me, a $5,000 fine to the restaurant and the possibility that establishment could lose their liquor license for 72 hours (that was at the discretion of the liquor board officer). Oh, and I'd be immediately fired.

Yeah, not putting my job and my company's livelihood on the line. No amount of age is EVER going to make that seem like a wise idea. "
"I'm a bad ""close friend"". 

I always feel like I am psychologically and emotionally holding people at arm's length from me no matter how much time I spend with them.

I'm also really bad at expressing emotions or thinking of something to say. I tend to resort to just listening, asking questions, or not saying anything. 

Most of my close friendships I have allowed to just fade out through no contact, and I cancelled on people a lot. 

I probably come accross as disinterested in other people or ""fake"". Really I just am an introvert and also struggle with mental illness (PTSD, depression, anxiety). I don't actually want to hurt or lose anybody. "

"Just wanna say I appreciate that you're not trying to advocate your preference as better than other women's and apologize that in return you're getting proselytized by others. I get kind of sick of the constant ""YOU SHOULD USE A DIVA CUP, STRANGER I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT OTHER THAN THAT YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF MENSTRUATION!!!!!!"""
I hated it when they'd send a message and I wouldn't respond quickly enough for them and they'd essentially have a shit fit and insult me before I even knew what happened.

"Growing up my dad always scolded me...eventually lectured me on my face. He would always say, ""I wish I had a mirror so you could see how you look like."" I never understood what his point was. In my head, all I could think was ""blame yourself and mom for giving me this face"".


Went to college and learned of the ""Resting Bitch Face"". Me to a T. Now I have to keep a slight smile on my face whenever I'm at work or at a social gathering. Luckily my friends know me enough to know that it's literally just how my face sits.

No.

It's hard to give someone that title who made their living off of the insecurity of thousands of women to stroke his own ego and to build his brand and empire.

*The Girls Next Door* was a brilliant reality show with a killer concept.  I've seen it several times.  I've read Holly Madison's book.  And although I don't pity her for not leaving sooner, because she benefitted from her time there, I believe what she wrote.  And I believe what I saw on the show.

"Outdoorsmanship. There are great modern day campaigns (REI's force of nature, etc) that are celebrating tough-as-nails women and I'm lucky enough to personally know some fellas who love rock climbing and backpacking with ladies.

But classic American outdoor exploration and recreation had this subtle theme of ""women are just distracting men from nature."" I don't know how many books I've read of men who leave their home so they can travel across the country and heroically resist ogling the curvy diner waitress while contemplating the struggles in his life."

"This guy who apparently didn't know what stretch marks were. 

I was wearing a crop top and I have a few stretch marks on my sides. They're white and faded but still visible in bright light or sunlight. I was sitting outside a club in Berlin at 10am (after dancing all night), this creepy Belgian guy sits next to me and asks what happened to me while pointing at my stretch marks. I told him I got attacked by a guy outside a club, and I got the scars in self-defense. He didn't get the joke, but nonetheless leaned in to kiss me (I guess he thought I was trashed because I was outside a club) and I just got up and told him ""I have to go home and put ointment on my scars""."
"Once. I was in a mentally bad place and I got scared and thought I needed something different.

I regretted it almost immediately, and was in a pretty deep depression for a few months. He and I saw each other again through mutual friends and I knew I had made a mistake. I asked him to talk to me and we eventually got back together. That was 12 years ago, and we're happily married.

We never discuss that period irl anymore. I would like to think it never happened."
"Your phone thing while creepy may have been a technical issue. Ive had similar situations with a particular phone.

When I was a young ish teen I used to stay at my grandparents place fairly regularly overnight, and on several ocassions while having a phone conversation with a friend our calls would get interrupted by mild static and jumbled bits of other conversations, I wouldn't be surprised if you were experiencing a similar if different issue."
"I was walking home one night around midnight when a man crossed the street towards me and said, ""Hey, come this way"" and tried to get me to go down a random, dark side street with him. Some other guy who happened to be walking by overheard and asked if I knew the first guy. I told him I didn't know him, so the second guy asked if he could walk with me for a while so I wouldn't be alone. We walked for probably 15 minutes together before we parted ways. Never saw him again, but I still appreciate how quickly he stepped in to accompany me."

"OP - I found this article to be quite accurate https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/

Even if it sounds like a ""made-up"" problem, then based on each and every one of my girlfriends - it's a real problem they face when sharing household duties. It's the thing even the ones with the 'best boyfriends' complain about not being fair. And it isnt.

It's not saying the guys are lazy and wrong. It starts with our mothers who'll iron the shirts for their sons and husbands, but will berate their daughters for showing up in a wrinkly dress. This way half of the population will get the ""schooling"" about how this stuff works and the other half... well doesn't. Be aware of the gap and work to close it. Teach your future children equally in that sort of stuff. Don't say you are ""babysitting today"" when they are your kids. Don't tell kids you are ""helping mom"" when you're involving them in cleaning. Cleaning and watching after kids isn't a job reserved to those with vaginas. "
"I was catfished on myspace in 2004. I was 19 years old and had virtually zero dating experience in real life and was relatively new to the internet. I talked to this guy named Kyle for a year and half before I decided to go out West to be with him.  I set myself up with my own apartment, job and applied to the local university just in case things didn't work out between us. I went because Kyle had pancreatic cancer and I was afraid that he might die before I ever had the chance to meet him.

When I arrived in BC Kyle refused to meet me for the first several week and dangled the opportunity to finally meet in front of me like a carrot. I guess after a while he couldn't put up with the charade anymore and confessed that he was actually a she. I also found out that the pancreatic cancer was a lie, the death of ""his"" mother to breast cancer was a lie and virtually everything he ever told me that had any significance was made up. 

Now that many years have passed since the incident I can see all the red flags clear as day. I've also had to come to terms with how emotionally abusive the whole situation had been both before and after we met. As it turns out when someone convinces you that they're going to die you end up forgiving a lot of otherwise unforgivable stuff. Fortunately I was able to get free of the situation but it took me 5 years to untangle myself from that web.

There is so much that went on during that time that I still can't believe I went through. I'm very fortunate that at the worst it was a girl pretending to be a guy and that I wasn't lured by someone who was going to rape and murder me. Looking back I am surprised at how fearless I was going out there. I wouldn't repeat the experience again. I still haven't really disclosed the full details of my experience to anyone in my life but am in the process of writing a book about it as a means of therapeutic release and to share what I learned in that time.

"I tried to explain to a guy once that sex can sometimes feel different (ie; better or worse) depending on the time of the month and in what position the cervix is at that point.  He said, what do you mean the position?  You mean *IT MOVES????*  He was utterly perplexed and it was hysterical to see that blank glazed over look in his eyes as he was trying to process it.  I think I scared him away from intercrouse for a while.  I should probably apologize to his girlfriend."

"I was a cashier at a grocery store in high school. One night when I was like sixteen I was working the closing shift. It was around 11:30pm when this middle aged guy came in to buy a gallon of milk. No big deal nothing weird about that right? 

So, our store had this policy where if we didn't bag an item we had to put these big orange stickers on them so we'd know if they had paid. So I grab a sticker and try to stick it on, and the man grabs my hand, looks me near dead in the eye, and says in a very calm voice ""If you put that sticker on my milk I will stab you to death right here"". 

I was terrified, the only people in this huge store were the two of us and my manager who was locked in his office tallying the registers. If he'd been violent nobody would have been able to stop him. I just pulled my hand away, handed him his receipt and told him to have a good night.    "

Non-physically: I honestly don't even understand how the guys around me not think of this but, their social media activity. There is an entire page on Instagram that shows your friends' activities, Facebook and Twitter put your activities on my home page. I don't even need to put effort to see what you do on social media.
