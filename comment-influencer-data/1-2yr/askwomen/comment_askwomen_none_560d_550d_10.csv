"My sister had terminal brain cancer and knew her time was running out. I was her caregiver. One day she caught me crying, and asked me why I was upset. I told her, “I’m ashamed to say it, but I’m losing my hair due to stress. I feel stupid and selfish telling you about it when you’re going through chemo and everything else.”

My sister said, “It *is* a big deal. If I were you, I’m sure I’d feel upset too. If something’s making you feel bad, it’s still important. It’s not fair to you to compare it to whatever someone else is going through.”

Another one from her.. tearing up, she told me she felt terrible for me and the rest of the family, “because I can’t imagine what it would be like if I were losing one of you..”

"My dad passed when I was 16 and I saw him die. But my mind couldn't accept it. He's been ill for months at that point but I thought (because I wanted to believe) he just fainted. When my older brother came over I was at the neighbors (my best friend and her family) so he knew from the first moment he was gone. When he came to the neighbor's flat he talked and acted very calm, even made little jokes, but said dad's condition was serious. He understood I wasn't ready to hear the truth yet. He wasn't ready to comfort me yet and everyone in our house was sobbing their eyes out. He waited until I had breakfast, accept that dad was in a bad condition and that I needed to be prepared for the worst, and for my mom &amp; her siblings in the house calm down a little so they could support me as well.

He had JUST lost his father himself and he could still think of all these and manage to do it."
"My mentally ill mother put me in therapy as a small child. She was not yet diagnosed, but she knew she was volatile and that we were having a hard time communicating on top of the extreme life experience we were living. She knew she wanted to foster communication on a level she didn't grow up with, she knew she needed help beyond her ability, and hoped in doing so she'd set me up for what would be a better life than her own.

My mother was a hermit. An actual in the woods hermit at one point, battling with mania and schizophrenia. So pushing herself as she did for her child amazes me. I have vivid memories of her fighting her main bad voice telling her she wouldnt win when it came to the topic. 

In the same grain, though more general intelligence, when I entered the school system she fought tooth and nail to get me into the good school, not the poor one we fell into the catchment for. It was months and month of letters as a young woman who was slowly but violently losing her mind, meetings and money she didn't have all because she worried about the lack of support I'd have outside of the home.

I fucking love my mother.

**edit** *So after I posted this, I called my mom. We actually don't talk too often, maybe once a month or two. I keep to myself a lot, and she to herself. But man, what a conversation this sparked. I read her the replies to this and she cried a lot. It turned out there was an issue with her meds last week and she was experiencing voices full on for the first time in a long while, and she didn't want to tell me. She was dealing with a lot of fear. Her voices manifest in a lot of stuff about me - her being a bad mother, someone out to hurt me, how she may hurt me.. stuff like that. So I read her my post, and what you lovely people said about her, and she's deeply moved. It was exactly what she needed to hear right now. Thanks for the well timed thread, OP.*

**edit 2** so my mom sent this long, long message. I honestly have no idea what she is trying to say (my mother's mind is very out there sometimes and is a beloved meme in my circle) but I know she's found words she wanted to say so I'm passing them on. [Her message] (http://imgur.com/a/JhAsJ). I think she's speaking to the user who expressed fears about being schizophrenic. She's sent more (lol) about being a mom with schizophrenia but I think that portion is more for me. 

I'd like to throw in here that my mom looks pretty crazy. She dresses the part, speaks the part and people treat her like shit everywhere she goes. Just try to keep her on mind next time you encounter someone like her."
"This is taken from a meta post on indianpeoplefacebook about why men in India tend to do these things:

&gt;""To explain the way they speak to females, namely white girls, it's definitely a cultural barrier. In countries like India or Pakistan, sex before marriage is highly frowned upon. It can ruin your life and get you kicked out of your family if your parents find out. Western cultures don't have quite as severe consequences for premarital sex, and Indians know this. From their perspective, white girls are [slur for easy]. So the way they speak to white girls is literally the way they'd speak to an [easy woman], because to them it's the same thing. They don't yet understand that just because a white girl will sleep with a few men before she gets married, that doesn't mean she'll sleep with any man who asks.""

So practically, it's a ""american girls stereotypically have a lot of sex, so it probably doesn't matter to them who it is! I'll try my chances!"" A lack of cultural understanding paired with a sprinkle of cultural sexism. And optimism!"
Women’s sexual fluidity is more accepted (and in some cases encouraged) by society than men’s. 
my sister. she wouldn't listen to me and thought i just wanted her to be unhappy. i felt so bad about him that i passive-aggressively (i was 19) wore black to the wedding. he is locked away now for attempted murder.
"Honestly, it was everything they did.  I was in high school (15) when my mom died.  My friends immediately banded around me, including coming to the funeral which was during our spring break.

If they saw me crying or about to lose it in public (she died right before Mother’s Day), they would find a way to get me privacy.  Sometimes that meant making really quick excuses or distractions for people around us while another of them ducked me into someplace private.  Other times it meant hugging me tight so I could hide my face when there wasn’t somewhere for me to hide.

When I tried to withdraw because I have shitty coping mechanisms, they pulled me back to them with sleepovers, one-on-one talks, or just physically being near me until I was strong again.  At no point did they ever make it about them or try to sweep it under the rug.  They took their cues from me on when I needed to talk about it and when I just wanted to be “normal.”  They didn’t pity me, they supported me.

When teachers would ask why I was dressed in all black or tease me for being sad, my friends would step in and let them know what happened so I didn’t have to speak around the lump in my throat.  And when I got mad, like...really mad, because it’s just not fucking fair, they let me have my anger and acknowledged it was super shitty.  

As a 29 year old adult, I marvel at how my friends knew to be there for me.  Losing a parent is hard at any age, but when you’re a kid, it shows a lot of compassion to be able to be there for your friend without trying to make it high school drama.  It’s an adult problem with adult emotions in a child’s setting.  I got a lot of words from everyone, but the things I cherished and appreciated the most were the actions."
"I am trying very hard.

I am very tired."
"Not the most emotionally intelligent thing, but today my boyfriend told me his younger co-worker came in with a big scratch on his face. When he asked about it, the guy answered jokingly that his girlfriend did it. My boyfriend then started paying attention to anything else the guy said about his gf and noticed he was in a pretty bad abusive relationship. They had a calm, but difficult conversation about what abusiveness is or can look like in a relationship. I'm so proud of my boyfriend, really. "
"He's one of the best people I know. He's kind, super talented, thoughtful and really smart. We're totally in sync and understand each other so deeply, we sometimes don't even need to talk about things but as a couple, we genuinely brought out the worst in each other. 

I don't know what it was but as soon as we dated, we just absolutely hated each other. He made me cold and caustic, I made him lazy and cruel. So we broke up and ten years later, we're the best of friends."
"TL DR; good friend allowed me to make a mistake that I needed to make, even though it was at her expense, and was there for me afterwards when I felt horrible about it. 

I (straight female) was basically emotionally addicted to this guy (lets call him Hal) who didn't treat me very well and basically had two girlfriends, one of them being me. One day I was having brunch with one of my best friends, lets call her Jill. 

During brunch I started getting texts from Hal saying him and his friends were going on a road trip for the day, and he wanted me to drop everything and come along. I told him I'm having lunch with my friend, but I can come when I'm done, but he basically said, ""no we are leaving now."" I wanted to hang out with him so badly that I decided I wanted to ditch my friend, during brunch, to go hang out with this guy. 

Jill and I are both busy and go out of our way to make time for each other, and had been looking forward to this brunch for a couple weeks. She was not, unsurprisingly, not a huge fan of Hal or our unconventional relationship. 

I told Jill ""I'm so sorry... I think I want to go with him."" 

She just stared at me, smiling a bit.

I was like, ""I think I have to make this mistake. I can't believe I'm doing this but I'm blowing you off. I know exactly what I'm doing, and it's so disrespectful. I'm so sorry."" 

She was not pleased but she calmly said ""Ok, you do what you have to do, and let me know afterwards how it goes."" So the guy came to pick me up in the middle of brunch and I completely ditched her. 

Turns out the reason Hal wanted me to come was so he could vent to me about his problems with his other girl and get my advice. It was a horrible day trip and I knew i deserved it.
 
Jill was patient and empathetic and forgave me. The incident helped me start detaching myself from the guy.

"Just because I can do something one day **do not assume I can do it another**

Seriously I have a wall, and when I hit that wall, I *can't* do any more.  


Also, if elderly people could stop acting like they have the market on arthritis that'd be swell.  The amount of old fucks who ""well I have arthritis too and I'm not complaining, stop acting like it's that bad"" is rage inducing.  


Cool, but it took you like 60 years to get sick. I've been this way since my mid-twenties, it's only going to get worse, I'm on serious drug therapy, and it's so bad I have disability tags on my car and *you aren't even taking medicine for yours besides Tylenol, get the fuck over yourself Edith*"
I'd be divorced.
"Pros

Men: usually better at being dominant in the bedroom, and they’re usually better about giving you alone time 

Women: everyone always gets an orgasm, and the gifts are usually more thoughtful or meaningful 

Cons

Men: foreplay for you is often treated as just the toll they have to pay to get penetrative sex

Women: arguments are less frequent but they’re 4 hours long instead of 15 minutes"

"My mother in law attempted to treat me poorly and ban me from family events because I was honest with my children about Santa being fake when they started asking questions. When my husband arrived home from work I was a bawling mess. I told him what happened and he calmly dialed her number. She was screaming on the other end but all he said was ""I chose to spend the rest of my life with her and if she is not welcome at holidays then I won't be there either."" I remember this moment every time I feel frustrated or impatient with him and it brings me back down to earth."
Because I hate bacon. People get so defensive of their bacon.
" From my experience, a lot of reddit is obsessed and awkward about women. A post in gaming got to the front page because #upvotedbecausewoman...
And then in the same post men are complaining that its a shitpost and got such attention cus its a woman, and the same post made my a man would never get to the frontpage.

And like, its really scary to see such a large online male audience just HATE women for existing and not fucking them? 

Oh and im so wary for women who post in threads on askreddit, like the one i saw just now saying ""women who had their nudes leaked, howd it affect your life"" cus you KNOW on some level, if there are earnest answers in there, there WILL be people who stalk those users and try to find these leaked nudes.

Im sorry for being a little off-topic but im super jaded at this point concerning a majority of men. No woman can hate another with the vile contempt that some men can. "
"He always supported me and truly believed in me and what I do. He always went out of his way to show that to me. We had fantastic plans together, many common interests, and a ridiculous amount of chemistry. We could spend hours and hours together just talking and never get bored of each other.

He's an ex because, despite all of our compatibility, we had one major incompatibility: he leans poly and decided far into the relationship that he needed that. It is something I couldn't give him."
" I was at a rave. Standing in line to the bathroom, heard some girls screaming, ran in there to see some girl having a miscarriage on the bathroom floor .. the worst part was she was tripping out of her mind &amp; laughing . "
"This is simultaneously the worst/grossest and coolest thing I’ve experienced in a bar. I was standing in a very long line for the women’s bathroom and the girl standing behind me puked all over my back. Before I could even wrap my head around what just happened, several other woman in line- total strangers- whisked me into the bathroom and started cleaning me with paper towels/ soaps/ body spray that the bathroom attendant had, and one of them even went to a bartender and scored me a brand new shirt with the bar’s name on it. I hadn’t even asked for their help, and in like 5 minutes the whole problem was fixed. Those girls were fucking awesome. Like Wolf from Pulp Fiction. They handled shit."
What separates the two is an understanding of social cues. Acting creepy = you aren't paying attention to how she's responding and continuing to pursue her despite her lack of interest. Flirty = mutual interest. 
"Yes. 

I was a teenager and it was my cousin's SO. He acted funny and I felt funny around him plus many things he claimed to be good at he couldn't actually do and for some reason this scared me. My cousin and her SO were in their early 20's.

I never really butted into people's business at this age, but I told her what I saw and how I felt. She listened and understand and after he was discovered to be force-flashing her roommate and other aggressively sexual things she broke up with him. She took me out to lunch and asked me how I knew and we had a very in-depth conversation I never expected to have at 14 with a 20-something mother with a job, home and already a few degrees under her belt. "
"Was in a training class with this chick for a call center job. She was constantly getting in trouble for texting DURING training because if her boyfriend texted and she didn't reply within minutes, ""he would get mad"". He was CONSTANTLY texting on her to check her whereabouts when he had to have known she was working. We had the same schedule for 16 weeks. One day our group was going to lunch and said ""hey 'Sara', do you want to come grab lunch with us?"" We were walking out the door to leave. She said ""I have to text my boyfriend and ask If that's ok"". We left without her when he didn't reply. At the end of training as we were about to get on the phones, where her job would have been *GASP* talking to men on the phone in a customer service context, she said she had to quit. Her boyfriend didn't want her to have a job where she was ""talking to other men"". At some point someone asked how long she had been dating this guy, she said *less than a year*. I just cannot fathom giving up a good paying job and that much of your personal autonomy to someone that paranoid and jealous after less than a year. "
"Allllll of what you said. Yes. It’s crazy how women are treated in male dominated subs here.

I frequent r/trees and if you’ve ever been on that sub, there’s tons of “high thoughts,” pictures of peoples’ weed or pictures of their favorite smoking pieces. it’s a very lax vibe. usually.

I was still pretty new to Reddit when I made the grave mistake of attempting to participate while being female at the same time. 

I posted a photo of my favorite bowl and in the background you could see my leg and that i was wearing knee high socks. The bowl was obviously the purpose and center of the photo and I truly was not aware that the background was sooo eye catching that it would cause an uproar. It was my (unshaved) knee lol. 

It got hundreds of upvotes, paired with comments about how girls are such attention whores and smoke weed “to be cool” and obviously I was trying to “be sexy” (again... it was my knee.) I got many messages calling me ugly and pathetic. So many #UpvotedBecauseGirl comments. I know it’s dumb, but I actually cried over how harsh some of the comments were. 

I guarantee if you ask any of those guys what kind of girls they like, they’d probably claim “chill girls who smoke weed.” Unless it’s some cyber girl who they can’t fuck. Then she’s just some useless attention whore whose only mission in life is to look “cool” and “sexy” to random guys on the internet! 

Meanwhile, girls were reaching out to me and apologizing for how I was treated and telling me about some “female friendly” weed subreddits like r/EntWives and r/MakEnts. 

Sorry for the rant but your post reminded me of that, I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone about it or how it truly infuriated me. Just one of many times that I was totally confused about the way men were treating me (or other women). "
"I didn't know what to do with body hair. When my legs and armpits started growing, I remember being baffled when the other kids laughed at me when we were at the pool. 

My aunt came over with a razor and shaving cream. I hid in my bedroom until she coaxed me out. I was too afraid that I'd cut myself, but she showed me how safe it is on her own leg, and then let me shave her leg.

I love my aunt."
"she was beautiful, smart, ambitious, and i ruined it with my own insecurity. i was the asshole."
"That's because it's fetishizing, not supportive. It takes the love of two women and makes it a spectacle for the straight man."
"She is kind, beautiful and we had fantastic chemistry and a lot in common. Since I don't want children we had that talk early on - she didn't either. 

Then she became an aunt. Watching her brother and his love for his son made something change in her. We talked about it for a long time and ended up deciding we both need to be with people who want the same as we do. "
My dad only speaks up when he really has something genuine or helpful to add to a conversation. Otherwise he just smiles at you or the group totally content with comfortable silence. He doesn’t assume everyone is seeking his advice just because they’re talking to him and doesn’t give it unless asked. Sometimes (especially when I was a teenager) this was infuriating but now I appreciate it. 
"Okay guys! listen up! 
I am an Indian girl and we get those friend request too. Now, in India..let's just say you'll meet many people of different mindsets..a part of our population is advanced i.e. they are fluent in English, know the meaning of consent, support gay rights ( i mean most of em do but like you know..opposition exists), date other people, respect women and the guys just don't go around texting random females for nudes. If you meet an Indian exchange student in a foreign country, there is a 98% chance that he belongs to this group of Indians. When you come to India..you can find these type of Indians at Cafes, Malls and shiz.. Then there are these orthodox sleazy men who think women should stay in their houses in order to protect their honor..so the concept of dating is foreign to them, contributing to that most of them are sexually frustrated because they only get to do the deed after they are married (which also gives rise to marital rape)..Basically, they think of foreign women and us the ""western"" Indian females as easy because we don't think of sex as a taboo. These are the type of Indian's you'll find at tourism places (Exceptions are always there).. NOT ALL INDIAN MEN ARE THE SAME."
"A very close friend (roommate for 7 years and MOH at my wedding) had to choose between two guys she was casually seeing as they both started getting more serious and wanted to commit.

I liked one of them a lot. He was funny, smart, kind, and attractive. When he hung out with her friends and family, he made an effort to make a good impression. And whenever something bad happened, he was the first one to show up at our door and try to help her through it. 

The other guy always left a bad taste in my mouth. I can't put my finger on why, it was just always a feeling I had. He never put in the effort to get to know her friends or family and when she'd call him for help, he'd always be unavailable. He didn't prioritize her. 

I told her I had a bad feeling about the second guy. She picked him anyway. When I told her I didn't think he was right for her, she told me it was a mistake she had to make for herself.

He was a total jerk to her that led her on for a couple of years. He cheated a ton. And then he dumped her the morning after saying he loved her. We don't speak of him now. "
The black to the wedding is hilarious though.
The creepy dude will disregard any sign that you are not interested and ignore your boundaries and not care if you are visibly uncomfortable. He will press on regardless.

"Engage in conversations like actually listen to them and ask questions and you will be surprised of the outcome. I used to be ""boring"" but I realized it was because I wasnt actually paying attention"
"After lots of platitudes about everything being God's plan, happening for a reason, yadda yadda...one of my friends looked me in the eye and said, ""It's not fair.""

"I did, so pretty damn sweet!"
"I strongly dislike babies and children and don’t find them cute at all in any way.

I also hate cheese."
I don’t like food. People actually get mad about it or think there’s something wrong with me. I simply find it a major inconvenience to have to feed myself three times a day (and buy food and prepare food and wash the dishes and all that incessant chewing omfg)
Berating people for not drinking.  It shouldn't be cool to pick on someone for not drinking alcohol.
"It's like that Donald Glover joke about why guys have so many ""crazy ex-gf"" stories but women have so few ""crazy ex-bf"" stories. It's because if you have a crazy ex-boyfriend, you're gonna die."
"I don't like wearing my hair down very often. When I was in elementary school and high school I wore it up in a bun almost everyday, because it was a frizzy mess and I didn't want to wake up early to tame it. A lot of people found it very strange and told me to wear my hair down. I'm out of school and work full time now and usually wear a pony tail to work, and I have coworkers commenting on how my hair is always up, that I should wear it down. I really only like to wear it down for special occasions; it's just not as comfortable to me. "
"My boyfriend used to follow me around ‘in case I was cheating on him’ and even got a job at the same place as me to keep track of me. He also forbade any male friends and didn’t even like me spending time with family. He raped me after a staff party we both went to because a male colleague had talked to me. 
In the end, turned out he’d been cheating on me. 
You do realise that this will get pretty dark, right? I even know of a woman whose boyfriend set her on fire because he was jealous (they were both killed). Check the news. It’s full of what jealous men have done to women. "
"There was a time my friend's boyfriend borrowed a dollar from me. He and I had an inside joke about how he owed me a dollar, I made it clear I was being sarcastic and didn't care if he didn't pay me back. One day I saw him and jokingly asked where my dollar was and he just snapped and started cursing at me. I was surprised because I had never seen him angry before and told him I was only joking but I saw some malice in his face.

I thought maybe he thought I wasn't joking and felt bad, but he and I had always laughed it off and sometimes he would joke at me about it before I did it as well. I could have just brushed it off as him having a bad day but something about his tone and expression made me feel really strange.

Later on my friend admitted that he had started to abuse her, physically and verbally. When I thought about the timeline I realized it was around that day he snapped at me. I wish I had told her earlier or even lightly brought up his behavior, but I just kept quiet about it. She got out of the relationship but afterwards he spent months stalking and harassing her. "
"I don't really like movies. I will watch shows, even enough in a row that they are ""movie length."" But actual films, to me, feel like more of an investment somehow. Coupled with the fact that each genre is insanely predictable- most comedies/ action movies are formulaic, IMO. Plus shows' characters develop and leave you wanting more - movies rarely captivate me in the same way"
"I'm jealous of the fact that they don't have to deal with periods. They don't have to deal with the annoyance of having to cancel plans because of a period, or go through the cramping that sometimes accompany it. I'd like them to see how it feels. 

On another note, I'm annoyed at how people don't always take girls seriously when they're angry and always use their anger as an excuse to make a period joke. Being angry =\= being on your period.

(Note: I'm only talking about people who are biologically male)"
"I want to be able to talk about my body or joke about wanking and it be funny rather than having this weird pornographic overtone. I'd like to be able to say 'vagina' without people getting quiet or embarrassed.

A situation I want them to be in...hmmm...I think probably when people reference your gender constantly, especially when you've achieved something. You're not a comedian, you're a female comedian, and 'for a woman' you're doing very well, and 'I met some other women doing it and they were good too'. I was at a conference the other day and I was talking to someone who had what sounded like a pretty cool project going on. He was at pains to tell me how many women  he had on his crew - the DP, *she's* a woman, we had a female camera operator once....yeah, ok mate, I get it. You ""respect"" women. I genuinely think he had total good will, but it's noticeable how often the female gender is brought up if it's the creative arts. A woman who writes is not a ""writer"", she is a ""female writer""."
"There are so many battles people fight each day that are labeled ""heroic"" and 90% of them don't fit that mold. Being a schizophrenic with vivid auditory hallucinations and *still* fighting for your kid (fighting *yourself*) is truly heroic, I don't think people can appreciate the sheer amount of will it would take to endure through something like that, nobody asks to be put in that position.

I'm impressed you saw that struggle and took it on with her, you are probably a big part of the reason why she was successful in that regard."
I gasped at the cheese part.
"My mom died when I was 8 years old. But when I was 17, I was working at a grocery store as a cashier on Mother’s Day. They put me on the “mother’s lane” register that day. So basically, my cashout Lane was reserved for only people getting things for Mother’s Day last minute. I was pretty bummed out and someone I worked with noticed. He was 21 at the time (he ended up being my roommate for a few years later on). He asked me what was wrong and I just flat out said “Mother’s Day is just hard for me. Everyone is buying things for their mothers and I can’t, because she’s gone.” He said, without skipping a beat, “You can buy me something for Mother’s Day if you want.” At first I kind of chuckled like he was joking. But he said he was serious and that if I wanted to buy a card and write something in it for my mom or about my mom that I could do that and just give it to him and that way I’ll be able to participate in Mother’s Day and tell someone about my mom at the same time. It was really really sweet. For the next maybe 4 years or so we did this. And if I didn’t get a card, I would text him happy Mother’s Day. Just to wake up that day and be able to say it to someone was a relief for me."
"A woman invited me into a bathroom stall with her and asked me to hold her purse while she took a leak and did a line of coke at the same time.

I guess that one seems like pretty normal club behavior, except that the woman in question was my boss. "
"Heard about? Torture and murder.

Seen? One douche wouldn't let his girlfriend talk to the bartender because the bartender was a man.

Experienced? Some guy flipped out on me for a week because I went to my brother's graduation and hung out for a couple of days. He accused me of cheating on him. With my brother. Texted my brother to make sure we were actually related and I wasn't lying. Not like having the same last name and a similar face makes it obvious enough or anything. "
Jill is an awesome friend.
"My sort of ex (guy I was seeing, wasn't serious) used to, unbeknownst to me, sit in the parking lot across the street from my house at night and watch me get dropped off from work by a co-worker. One night, said co-worker and I sat in his car for almost 30 minutes because we were deep in conversation about the trip to South Africa he had just gotten back from. When I went upstairs my ex knocked on my door, came in and screamed at me that he was always watching and that I was a cheating whore. I was making cheeky remarks because I had no idea what was going on, which is when he decided it would be a good idea to beat the shit out of me and kill my cat.  
 He left me still breathing, which was really a mistake on his part because not only did I get him sent to prison, but I had to actively stop several people from killing him over the course of the trial. He did get mysteriously mugged and assaulted during that time though.

Edit: To everyone saying they hope I'm okay, I am. Not long after after I recovered from Douche McGhee I met my husband and am 100% safe and happy. Douche tried to contact me a couple times after he got out but got a few, uh, anonymous threats and I haven't heard from him since. PS I am still angry about my cat though."
"In my experience, I've heard women do it more to women they know, men do it more to women they don't know."

"I was at a big art festival and one of my friends had lost his bike somewhere in this big festival the night before. In his hungover, panicked mind, the only reasonable option was that our other friend should lend his bike so he could go bike up and down the streets looking for it. It's basically a city of 70,000 people- it would take you weeks to cover the streets, even if you recognized your bike in a pile of hundreds of other bikes while biking past.

They had been arguing for a bit and I was watching silently until a third party joined, my female friend Lisa. Lisa, in the span of two minutes, very calmly asked Lost Bike Friend what the problem was, listened to his responses in full, validated his words, and managed to make him come to the conclusion that his plan wasn't reasonable. It took her another two minutes with him to come up with a reasonable plan (try to retrace steps he had taken earlier and ask around for notable individuals and bartenders he remembered). I had never seen someone be able to enter an argument and put it to a full stop, so quickly, and make everyone walk away happy. This was the incident that made me start putting effort into my own social and emotional skills."
"Women: For me, these relationships were way more intense emotionally in every way. When they wanted to be loving and romantic, that shit was an 11/10. Sexual encounters lasted a lot longer as well. It's also nice cuddling up with someone that's so warm, loving, and soft!

Men: Definitely more emotionally distant. I do almost all of the emotional labor in my current relationship with my boyfriend. Sex is still really good, just shorter. He often prefers to pay for me for dinner and other things. When I dated women, I actually paid a lot of the time. I also really appreciate how masculine he is: beard, broad shoulders, deep voice, etc. One of my favorite things is that since he's bigger than me, when he's big spoon or hugs me, I feel really safe and loved. Also, his smell. I swear I ovulate every time I get a good wif of his dude smell. "

"Had an insanely bad period, in 7th or 8th grade. Still wasn’t used to having periods, so I never kept pads on me.
The flow was so heavy that it leaked through my jeans, and the blood ran down my legs and into my socks. 
The nurse had pads, but, at that point, it was just damage control."

"Uh, women tend not to survive the worst ""crazy jealous boyfriend""stories that I've heard about.

"As a bisexual woman, it’s bullshit. Some people are 100% hetero, and some people are 100% gay. To question that, if the person hasn’t, is rude as fuck. 

I think women are less likely to be tormented for experimenting, and we all know how many guys sexualise lesbians and encourage girl on girl action (but don’t actually consider it legitimate attraction, sex or romance). So it may appear that women are more fluid, more willing to kiss people of the same sex etc. when the reality is it doesn’t have any bearing on their sexuality, it’s just societies acceptance of what’s ‘hot’."

"My brother had a very short marriage to a woman, who, I don't think was a bad person, but had some serious deep seated issues that she never addressed. From what I could understand, she was really manipulative, emotionally abusive and would gaslight him constantly. I consider myself decently emotionally intelligent but they way he handled the whole breakup made me realize i have room to improve, and should strive to be more like him. 

He's not angry or bitter, once we were in a store shopping for things for his new place and his wedding song came on. I asked if he was okay since this was only like two or three weeks after the breakup, and he was like ""yeah, it's still a beautiful song. I would never hate or dislike anything by association, that'd be stupid"". I don't know, I just thought that was so cool. "
"Freedom to travel, stay in hostels, etc more safely. I don’t wish anyone to go through the opposite, but I WISH I could feel more safe travelling around like my BF does. If it came down to myself and a guy on the street and someone had to pick one of us to mug, I always 100% think they would pick me. It just completely changes travelling and awareness you have to have about everything around you. "
"After my Dad died, my Mom said, “I’m sorry you lost your Dad.” They were married for 50 years, and she was also grieving but recognized how I must have felt as his daughter. She lost her own Dad around the same age I did. That meant a lot. 

After my Mom died, about five of her nursing staff showed up off-shift in the middle of the night to say goodbye. Some were in their pajamas or sweats and just rolled out of bed and drove over to her nursing home, including her favorite nurse who took care of her for seven years. They didn’t leave until the mortuary folks drive her away. My sister died a few months before, so they were my only “family” there. 

And, last but not least, my cousin from across the country had a huge frozen feast delivered to me, complete with wine. My Mom had died the day before, I was exhausted from the events of the previous months, and defrosted what I needed as I needed it. Very thoughtful.  "
"He inspired me, made me laugh, and was my best friend. He also let me eat his food. 

But most importantly, he treated me really well. I’ve realized one thing: when your boyfriend treats you with respect especially in front of his friends, they end up treating you the same. His friends treated me like family. 

We broke up because he moved away and I didn’t want to do long distance. We visit eachother once every year, and things always go back to how they were when we meet. I love him still and would always want the best for him. "
"I have a friend who is so smart just with anything emotional. She has this strong, deep understanding of herself and her emotions. 

So shes been having trouble with this guy whos flaky. Like he has this immune disorder so sometimes he’ll abandon plans because he’s sick but I thinks its partly his personity as well.  So she loved talking to him and when she saw him things were awesome but she couldn’t get him to make plans with her. Like she didn’t see him in person for two months! Anyways she was talking to me about it and she was just like ‘I spent all night crying because this guy was making me feel insecure, then I realized I’m awesome and he shouldn’t get that power so I’m not speaking to him
until it feels good again.’  and I just thought that was so mature of her to recognize that this guy was the problem, not her and she needed a break from it because it was making her feel insecure. 

I hope to be more like her someday. There are more stories I could tell of just how empathetic and compassionate she is but this one was the most recent. :)"
"My ex stalked me, sexually harassed me and emotionally abused me for months after the break up. When he found out i was seeing someone else he waited for me in the parking lot of my then job and wanted to force me into his car. He basically tried to kidnap me, two co workers helped me though. I was sure he wouldve killed me. "

"A lot of times when I complain about harassment, a common sentiment from men is ""must be nice."" I wish these guys understood the reality of feeling threatened constantly by a demographic that could easily overpower you.

I think a lot of men equate harassment with flirting. I like flirting. It's harmless and makes me feel good. Being yelled at by a group of men in a car when I'm walking alone does not feel good. "
"I've only dated one man and one woman so far, so you can take my experience with a grain of salt - but here goes:

Men: tend to communicate more directly and are more straight-forward, and also like to joke around a lot. Conversations tend to be lighter and less serious. It's also a lot easier to get guys to orgasm generally, haha. Physically, I like how guys have beards, broad shoulders and large hands (that's not a euphemism).

Women: I enjoy how we can both be very emotionally vulnerable, and this tends to foster a deeper sense of connection and intimacy. They are also more attuned to my needs when having sex. Physically I really enjoy how women have such soft lips and skin - plus I love women's breasts and curvy body shape.

I'm in a relationship with a woman now and prefer women so far. My current partner has an ideal mix of both stereotypically masculine and feminine traits - she is quite an emotional person, but also an incredibly logical thinker.

She's great at cooking and crocheting, but also handy with DIY and good at IT/coding. She has a large frame and broad shoulders that make me feel protected, but also beautiful soft skin and wonderful curves. :D"
"The night we ""officially"" started dating. We worked together and I was leaving my position. At this point we were just messing around, going for drinks every friday and promised each other ""no feelings attached"". 

That night we went to say good bye in the parking garage and both ended up crying our eyes out and saying I Love You for the first time. 

He gave me a gift to open when I got home (we thought we would never see each other again) and it was my favourite shirt of his, a bottle of the drink I had on our first work date together and the most beautiful card.

Now we are 8 months away from our wedding day ❤"
"I got my period when I was still in elemantary school. My mom wasn't expecting it so soon and hadn't told me about periods. I think she saw some spotting on my underwear when she was doing the laundry. The day I learned about periods mine started with HORRIBLE cramps. She said it wasn't always this painful but in my mind ""I'M GOING TO HAVE THIS EVERY MONTH FOR DAYS FOR DECADES???"""
"Research suggests that sexual orientation and arousal work differently in women than in men, and studies show that women tend to have physiological arousal to all types of erotic imagery, not just what fits their orientation, which is different to men. I assume that's where the claim comes from, along with other data showing that women are more likely to state that they've chosen or changed their sexual orientation.

But it's a big leap from this limited data to claiming all women are bisexual or sexually fluid. And it also ignores the fact that women's reports of subjective arousal seem to be less correlated to physiological arousal than is the case for men, suggesting that a psychological component may be a bigger factor and just measuring physiological arousal may not be all that useful. In any case none of the data is good enough to be making sweeping statements about."

"The thread asking about leaked nudes makes me sad. Unsurprisingly, the most up voted comments are the ones basically saying ""no big deal,"" so the take away message for a lot of the readers (which I expect are mostly male) is going to be: ""It's no big deal to leak nudes without consent and if someone is bothered by it, THEY'RE being unreasonable!"""
"I may get lost in the responses here, but this is my two cents. 

Men: Dating men is usually more low-key. The emotions are more of a slow burn where everything happens slowly and steadily. Men tend to be more light-hearted about the whole relationship thing and content to just enjoy the moment without stressing about the future. In addition, the men I've dated have been more spontaneous and willing to go out to try new things (food, bars, activities). Of course, that could just be a coincidence about the men I've dated and not a fact of ""all men."" On the downside, men tend to be more set in their gender roles. I sometimes feel annoyed by the strict roles we fall into when we are together: ie he pays, I be the emotional one that initiates all the important discussions, etc. With men I find much more emotional incompatibility as communication is more likely to break down. Sex with men lasts less long and usually tends to be unbalanced as far as orgasms go.

Women: Dating a woman is generally just more intense. Emotions run high and things move fast. Falling in love happens suddenly and communication is a HUGE part of the relationship. Therefore, emotional intimacy happens way more frequently. This translates to very balanced sex where both parties are fully committed to each other's needs. The sex lasts longer and is more of the ""making love"" sort. On the flip side, women can be exhausting. All those feelings all the time. It adds a seriousness to the relationship that at times is tedious. Women also tend to be less inclined to just enjoy a moment without worrying about what it means. 

The takeaway: For me, I prefer dating women. No matter what no relationship is without challenges, but I value the communication and emotional intimacy of women even if it means we sometimes exhaust ourselves talking in circles. Men are, for me, better for hookups and rebounds. But when I picture the future partner I want to raise a family and build a life with, I picture a woman. "
"I’m one of those women who don’t find myself hating other women. They aren’t competition, they aren’t dramatic, they aren’t high maintenance. Until I get to know them they are just people.

So I ask them questions, smile, sometimes I even complement them and I invite them to social events.

It turns out people mistake this humanity as lesbianism. But nope, I’m heterosexual and like the dudes. I just don’t understand the need to hate other women."

It's incredibly hard to get out of a situation like that, especially if there's more going on at home than just constant checking up (and yes, there will be most likely). I hope she got out eventually :(

"I have good and bad days. Just because you saw me complete a task one day doesn't mean on another day I'll have the energy. 

Disabilities don't always show themselves outwardly. I don't ""look sick"" but that's because I do a very good job of hiding fatigue in order to get through the day. 

Be aware that something that's easy for you can be like climbing a mountain for me. I'm not lazy, I'm not stupid. I'm just fighting a battle you don't have to fight. 

I'm not making excuses. I'm not making my illness out to be worse than it is to get out of things. I desperately wish I didn't have to deal with this shit every day. Coming clean and admitting I can't do something or need help with something because of my disability can be super embarrassing. Don't make it worse by assuming I'm over-exaggerating. "
"I've gotten bad vibes from my moms SO once (recent divorcee at the time). She was attention starved, needed validation, and latched onto whoever showered her with attention at the time (she is in a much better place now). He was the head of a car dealership she often worked with. This guy was ex-military, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but he lied a lot about his role in the military (I remember she once told me that he couldn't talk about his military experience because ""this is not a secure line"" and she was so tickled!). Like, really blatant ""I AM A TRUE HERO"" lies. Not quite ""stolen valor"" since he did serve, but he was talking a lot of obvious bullshit. He was an avid cocaine user and asked for topless pics of not only her, but her daughters as well. He is married but his wife is in another state. My mom found all of this... funny? Like she was so amused when she would tell me such abhorrent shit.  He was obviously an abusive asshole fuckwad to me but she wouldn't listen to reason. 

He ended up trying to blackmail her out of her position using racy texts and images she had sent. He was also seeing plenty of other women, including some of her co workers, behind her back. She ended up resigning from that position and hasn't had stable employment since."

"Back in the early 2000’s, it was because I read sci-fi/fantasy books all the time for fun.  (I was 11-15).  I’d bring them to school with me, wait for any opportune moment, and crack that baby open to thoroughly enjoy.

Now it’s not my reading habits, but the way my thoughts go 5 million miles an hour so the things I say come out as “random” or eccentric to people, but I swear I’m following a logical line of thought.  I just don’t have the time to explain the line."

"Not a woman, but: the other day i was in woodwind quintet rehearsal, and one member of the group was being particularly aggressive and treating me and another member like we were her students, rather than colleagues and friends. I was honestly about ready to blow a gasket, but right before i lost it, my cohort said ""I'm sorry, but i really don't like the way you are speaking to me right now. Can we take 5 minutes?"" And then we did, and everything was better. I just really appreciated that, because i know exactly how she felt, and it is so so so hard not to show your anger in a situation. It was really inspiring and ive been thinking about it all week. "
"To the already excellent answers, I will add:
 
1. Creeps try to make advances in socially inappropriate situations, particularly when women are clearly not looking to interact because they’re at work, or in the middle of their workout, or wearing headphones/focusing on their book or device.

2. Creeps get entitled and/or angry when their attention isn’t returned, and usually blame the woman for not cooperating. If the response to a woman not returning interest begins at, “What a @%#$!” and goes downhill from there, that is evidence that one is a creep."
"A fucking nightmare. In fact, I likely wouldn't still be alive. "
"The comfort that comes with it. In the beginning you get butterflies just getting to spend time with the person and you phone is the last thing on your mind. Mom calling? Nah, call her back later. Important work email hits? Reply on your way home. As the relationship develops, especially after you move in together, being together becomes part of life and the separation between the time you had alone and the time you had apart disintegrates. Now when mom or work phones, you find yourself answering when the other person is in the room watching tv with you. 

This is not because the other person has lost value to you or that you don’t cherish the time with them anymore, but the relationship evolves into life. It is very important to keep in mind that when he feels comfortable taking a call from family with you around, it is not because he doesn’t care about spending time with you anymore, its because he is comfortable and sees you as a part of his whole life now and not just those special moments you got to spend together anymore. "
"One of the best experiences of my life. I got my kitty in 1998 when the guy I was dating told me his mom was going to take one of her cats to the pound because it didn't get along with any other pets in the house. I offered to take her because I didn't have any pets. 

I picked her up that day and brought her home. She ran and hid under the bed. For several months, she wouldn't come out from under the bed. She was eating and using her litter box (in the hallway) but she must've been doing it when I was asleep or at work. I just let her do her own thing. I would talk to her sometimes when I was in the bedroom (just out loud - not getting down on the floor and looking at her under the bed). 

Then one day I was in the living room watching TV and I noticed motion out of the corner of my eye. I looked over and it was her - she was tentatively walking into the living room. I totally ignored her. This happened several more times over the next few days. I started talking to her when she would come in the living room. 

8 months or so after getting her, she was getting in my lap and sleeping in the bed with me. She no longer hung out under the bed. She even started playing with toys. I renamed her after that - fresh start and all.

20 years later, she had developed hyperthyroidism and her kidneys were failing. All in all she was actually doing OK with medication and diet changes. Then one day - on Feb 3rd - she had a stroke while laying in my lap. Mentally, she just wasn't there anymore. Lights on - but she's not home. She stopped eating. She could barely walk. So on Feb 10th we said goodbye. Over those 20 years, she had many pet siblings - she outlived 3 other cats and 2 dogs -
 and she never liked any of them :). But in the end it was just her and me again. I'll never own another cat. Not because of cat ownership in general, but because there is no other cat for me. "

"This is a sore spot for me. Nearly two years later and I'm still salty about it.

We spent the day having a family reunion with my husband's entire family! As a wedding gift, my parents had booked us a beautiful hotel and a couple's spa day for the day after our wedding (we had to be back at work 2 days later), so we could relax. 

My inlaws however decided it would be a perfect day for a family fucking trip to the mountains! Rented bus and everything! We cancelled our spa day, got up at 6:30 and went to the mountains, with MIL, FIL, SIL, her husband and a dozen aunts and uncles. The tour SIL picked was shitty, didn't take us to any good spots and the freaking coach broke down.

Then everyone wanted to go to dinner. So we then did a big fat family dinner! I had one thing I wanted to do on the day after out wedding, go to the ice creamery where we had our first date. The mountains and dinner took so long, that the place was closed. 

I like my in laws, but still don't understand why they thought we'd want to spend our first day as a married couple hanging out with the entire family, especially when we had to be back at work 48 hours later. I'm still pissy that I didn't get my massage and wrap....

"He did whatever he could to make me feel better. He’d be patient with me while I got irritated or quiet, fussy. He would pester me saying “what’s wrong” when I got really depressed. He cared. He would ask me “where do you wanna go? We’ll go anywhere you want” just to make me smile. He’d buy me whatever I wanted (I hardly took advantage of this), pay for hotels, concerts, food, etc since I was out of a job. He kept me as his screensaver. We went to a strip club for his cousins deployment, &amp; he refused lap dances from strippers even though I encouraged it. He didn’t even get a boner... He was kind, fun, open, and loyal.

But he didn’t actually love me. Two weeks into dating, he said he loved me. He was obsessed. He never remembered things I said during convo because he never listened. He always waited for his turn to speak. I felt invisible in that way, and misunderstood. Sometimes the reason for my irritability was him, and I couldn’t say why. I just felt like a prize to him. He complained and moped when we wouldn’t have sex for one day. We’d have it every day, several times. He’d get genuinely upset if I said I’m not feeling it this time. He’d ignore me.

He was the ideal boyfriend. Great job, master’s, bilingual (we’re both Mexican), my parents loved him, he’s tall, handsome, talented, smart, kind, generous, great in bed, always complimented me.... But I didn’t feel much in the end. It was just too fake. He didn’t really listen, so he didn’t really know me. I couldn’t see the relationship growing from that. I had to break it off.

I still have the cards he’d give me. He called me “magic” in them."
"My 9 year old sister never ceases to impress me with her emotional maturity. I've got a million stories I can share (including her comforting *me* after witnessing a traumatic event), but my favorite is how she dealt with her bully. 

So there's this girl that sits next to my sister in class. Let's call her Jasmine. Jasmine was friendly with my sister all through the school year up until last month - when, for whatever reason, Jasmine started the ""mean comments."" Nasty passing jokes about my sister ""smelling funny"" and ""having weird hair"" turned into full blown abusive behavior. My little sister tells me this girl yells at her, steals things off her desk, tries to get the other kids to join in on the abuse, etc. etc.

After what I assume was a particularly nasty day, my sister came home and finally confided this all in me. She hadn't shared it with anyone before, so our parents had no idea. Trying not to show how internally FURIOUS I was,  I asked if she was okay and what I could do to help. She gave me the most serene little smile and said ""Yeah, I told the teacher and she's letting me sit somewhere else. Not everyone is going to like me, but it's her loss cuz I'm tons of fun!!""

I literally had to hold back tears of joy. After giving her the biggest hug in the world and assuring her that she is the ""most awesome kid in the world"", I made us a big ice cream sundae and put on our favorite Disney movie. 

She's my little sister, but I look up to *her* :)"

But, in a more positive note: our relationship totally shifted from boyfriend/girlfriend to more of a “you and me against the world, babe” kind of thing. Like something about having a place together that you make your own made solidified our relationship. We moved in together after graduating college, so lots of major life changes were happening at once. It was so... comfortable?  I guess? to know that through it all I lived with him. That was my constant. Through jobs that failed and friends that moved away, I can still count on coming home to him (and our dog) at the end of the day. "
"I used to consider myself boring... like very boring. I never had an opinion about anything, never wanted to do anything too risky, always said no to invitations (because I knew I would be a drag), never had hobbies or interests.

I don’t know what changed. One day I think I realized my life was boring because I was boring. I made an effort to say yes to more things. I started paying attention and forming my own opinions. If i liked something i would research that topic for days and days! I started reading and exercising. I made an effort to leave my comfort zone and meet new people. 

Now, I am a full time student in a computer engineering program, I rock climb outdoors and paddle board when the weather is good. I read all the time! I’m exhausted because I say yes to EVERYTHING, but I’m having the best time of my life! I’ll have time to be boring when I’m older!"
"For me, it was working a highly stressful job. I started at 22. I knew my job very well and had a significant amount of responsibility, but no one took me or my pay seriously because I was quiet,petite, and “girly” looking. 

Eventually I just got sick of the shit. I chopped my butt length hair off to the shoulders. Ditched the dresses. Started speaking to the men like they spoke to me. Became more opinionated. Learned to handle sensitive situations better. Made my voice heard (always in a professional way). And wasn’t shy to show off my work product. 

I left that place at 24 as a highly respected professional. Not to sound cocky, but I take great pride in the person I’ve become and the challenges I was able to overcome (I have extremely bad anxiety and working in that kind of hostile environment was a HUGE challenge).

I’m still in the same career, and get calls from my old place of employment for help and advice. "

"Have my opinion accepted and respected on the basis of it just being my opinion, rather than having an intrinsic doubt because I'm a woman.

"Probably that my mother thought it was everyone's business when my period started for the first time. She sat down and made phone calls to all of my older siblings and other relatives telling them that, ""eatingabutt can get pregnant now."" (EXACTLY how she phrased it.) It was none of their damn business, and her attitude was just weird. She also made me feel uncomfortable like I had done something wrong.

"My son is 8 years old and my role model for how to treat others. He genuinely wants the best for other people, even when they are mean to him. Last year a little girl he's friends with punched him. He told the teacher, made sure they knew what had happened, but he instantly forgave her. He actually understood that she has some behavioral/emotional difficulties, and that the punching was a momentary impulse. They are still good friends and he is helping her in school. Likewise, his best friend went through a stage where he was being a jerk just to get a rise out of people, and my kiddo would say things like, ""I just wish he would learn that this isn't the right thing to do so that we can be friends again."" He's even made comments about the kid who tries to bully him that suggest he's still considering this kid's feelings. (Meanwhile I want to punch the little a-hole.) He holds no grudges. Everyone is forgiven."
"Not sure if it's really surprising, but it can be a tough pill to swallow:

You can't be everything for them and they can't be everything for you.

You may be the most important people to each other, but each of you will still need other people to fill certain roles in your lives at various times for different things: advisor, motivator, inspiration, shoulder to cry on, etc."

I'm sorry, I know she's your mother, but Jesus Christ. I'm also sorry he managed to derail her career like that. "
"Exactly as it is. It has been us against the world since I was 16, he was 17. People thought I was crazy but I knew at 16 he was my future husband. Married him when I was 21, he was 22. Expecting our first child this year, when baby is born we will be 27/28. "
"I was 18 and dumb, he was much older. There is a lot of scary to this story that I'd rather not relive through telling but the password protecting was the majority of the jealousy. I was also not allowed to go anywhere without him. He would accompany me to work and wait my whole shift for me to be done. He did not work until he had to.

His car broke down about 10 months into our ""relationship"" and neither of us could afford repairs (he didn't have a job, I was paying for EVERYTHING and living paycheck to paycheck) so he had to get a job to pay for it. 3rd shift cold calling job at a call center. I dropped him off at his new job the first night, and my instructions were to go right back to the apartment and wait for him to get home or something bad would happen. I went back to the apartment, packed as much as I could fit in my car as quickly as I could, and drove for 9 hours over night and ended up three states away. I didn't have my phone so I had no GPS or any idea of where I was heading. I was so scared and I thought about turning around so many times and going back to the apartment. But I didn't. I bought a $30 burner phone and called my mom to let her know I would be settling down where I ended up. She begged me to come home but he knew where my parents lived. I waitressed 3 shifts at different restaurants and slept in my car during breaks for a few months until I could afford a deposit on a studio. I got employed full time at a job where could support myself on less hours and have some free time. I bought a bed! Eventually I was well enough off to pay for some therapy to work through everything.

In the meantime he still had my laptop and phone and access to all my social media, emails, family contacts, bank accounts, etc. For almost a year he harassed my family and friends, trying to find me. He would post things like ""AMHOF IS A FILTHY CHEATING WHORE"" and ""WHERE ARE YOU, YOU'LL COME BACK"" on my Facebook page almost daily. My mom called the police so many times but his dad was deputy chief with issues of his own so nothing was done about it. 

12 years later I'm still in the same town I drove to. I bought a house and started college at 26, married at 29, and now I'm 30 with two degrees, a good job, and what I consider a great life. I'm not able to conceive children because of that man, though. But I have plenty of pets to fill my heart. 

I have never hated anyone before, but I really hope he is in prison or dead in a ditch somewhere."

"My boyfriend FREAKED OUT when we moved in together. Like he was consistently a sobbing mess for the first 6+ weeks that we lived together. 

This was his explanation: his family basically abandoned him when he was 16. When we moved in together he felt very secure for the first time since he was a teen and it brought up old feelings of abandonment.

He was very open about his journey and that experience really strengthened our relationship. He came out the other side changed for the better. Living together has fueled a lot of growth, but the transition was a challenge! "
"When one of my best friends got together with a guy, I didn't have a good feeling in my gut. He was complaining about his ex on their first date, he forced her to kiss him which made her feel awful. She didn't want to contact him anymore, but they attended the same class so she had no choice. One day he waited outside until she came out and he wouldn't leave her alone until she agreed to a second meeting.

However this worked, she fell in love with him from then on. And the first time I met him I didn't like him at all. My SO thought the same, we found him very creepy.

A few years have passed since then and it seems as if my friend is happy. He can be obnoxious and there are so many weird behaviors he exhibits. Sometimes he's even nice. But nothing major has happened so far. Knock on wood!"
"That's amazing of him! So many people shrug things like that off especially when it's a friend or coworker and even more so if the victim is male, your boyfriend is a good dude."
"I have depression, and while it's usually mild to moderate, there are some days when it's a struggle to get out of bed.  I still manage to get up, get showered and dressed, and make myself presentable on those days, but it usually means that I get to work later than usual.

My work day technically doesn't start until 8 and I'm usually in by 7:30/7:45.  So on the days when I walk in at 7:58 it would be really great if I wasn't hearing ""Cutting it pretty close there!"" or ""What did you do, stay out too late last night?""  Like, I'm still on time, I'm still presentable, and I'm still going to do my job well, so please back the fuck off."
"TMI but....

We’ve been dating for a year, and I honestly thought we had an expiration date, when I had **the worst cystic acne breakout** in my life. I’m talking I can’t smile without pus oozing out of *dime &amp; quarter (cysts clustered together so they become one gargantuan cyst) sized* cysts or being in pain. I can’t sleep on my side. I’ve had family &amp; friends tell me my face looked disgusting with all the kindness they could muster. I’ve had complete strangers driving on the street literally shout at me while I was walking on the side of the road to get a dermatologist because my face was that bad.

I told him we should break up as I did not want to go out at all &amp; I felt I was too disgusting for him to even be attracted to me. He never wavered. Literally kissed my lips and told me I was beautiful. 

I’ve never felt so many walls break down after that moment. When a guy tells you you’re beautiful &amp; stands by your side when the rest of the world sees your face as disgusting, he’s a keeper."
"My ex didn't want me to wear skirts and shorts in the summer. His mother said to him ""you don't get to choose what she wears"". She was a nice lady,I really liked her"
"I much prefer women in relationships. I find it hard connecting with men emotionally. Nevertheless, here you go.

Men: much more entertaining. They're funnier, more exciting, and are a lot more outgoing. They don't bother with petty emotional stuff and you can shoot the shit with them without worrying about saying the wrong thing or hurting feelings. The sex is better.

Women: more relationship oriented. Very passionate and romantic. Very in tune with their emotions, which supplements my lack thereof. Nurturing and caring. Sex is usually more emotional (""making love"")."
"Ive noticed a huge increase in this assertion that women are essentially monsters that have been getting a free pass by society for their behavior. I see posts like ""women hate women more than men do"" or ""women abuse men just as much as men abuse them"". Theres this deeper belief that all women are crazy, and has been around reddit forever, and redditors cling onto any statistical evidence that could somehow support this. Reddit hates women."
"Sometimes we put up with the Hals because we feel we don't have enough support in other places. When we feel more supported, we leave Hal. "
"I’ve found guys to be intimidated by it. Even though I personally have no issue dating people shorter than me, I had an ex in particular who very much believed I would never go for him because he was shorter than me. I hear it constantly that guys wont date a girl taller than them even though I also hear men say women don’t like short guys? The only other con would be clothes, whether it’s pants, dresses, skirts, or shoes, good luck finding anything. It won’t be long enough or come in your size (I wear a size 11 shoe). 
Other than that, it’s just whatever. Makes some sports easier. "
"He was amazing. Kind, supportive, made me laugh, got me a glass of water in the middle of the night if I woke up coughing, really treasured every part of me and the relationship, understood how to deal with my anxiety. He was an all-round good person, amazing in bed, cared about the same things and had the same values as me, would defend me to the death. He was my absolute best friend and the love of my life. He told me I made him the best version of himself and I think I always tried to be for him too. I still have the best time when I hang out with him, even as exes.

Five weeks ago I lost my sponsorship request and in two weeks I have to move to my home country indefinitely. Turns out love isn't enough to overcome distance."
I don't like sports but every 4 years I'll watch the shit out of some Olympic figure skating.
No clue at all. I had sex for the first time with a stranger I met in a club in Spain. Literally only know his first name. 
"To add to this:

I have some good days, and some bad days. 

On the bad days, I don't want to do anything, and maybe cry sometimes over the feeling of helplessness, but I have no choice but to 'keep calm and carry on'. I am practically a shut-in, and seem quite introverted. If I'm lucky, my anxiety won't become utterly disabling.

On the good days, I can seem extremely hyper, energetic, and extroverted. I can practically make friends with any stranger in about 5 minutes, and talk with them for 2 hours. I will also usually compile an A+-quality literary essay, with citations, in 2 hours' time.

For as long as I can remember, I have, most always, feel as though I'm pretending or acting like I'm 'normal'. I plaster a smile on my face because people tell me, 'You'd look so much better if you smiled.' People don't like it when I 'slip'.

I am trying very hard.

I am almost constantly, simultaneously, full of restless energy and/or exhausted."
"Like you, I was very disheartened by a long streak of bad dating experiences. I went out with friends, expecting nothing, and met a guy. He was kind of looking in my direction a lot and smiling, but seemed too anxious to come say hi. He was so cute. After a while, I guess he mustered up the courage. Said 'hi' and then literally fell silent immediately after. I helped him carry the conversation and he recovered. He asked me for my number, but at that exact moment, my friends came to get me because the bar was closing. I had to get my coat and told him to wait. He thought I was blowing him off and went home. :(

The next day, I had a friend request from him on Facebook. He asked me out and we've been together for 2,5 years now and live together. "
"My relationship experience with other women is sadly almost zero, so this is in no way representative, *but* one difference I noticed going from a relationship with a woman to being with a man is that men (a certain type of man, at least) are more inclined to shower you with affection and overall romanticise you as a person (I like this as I also tend to put my romantic partners on a bit of a pedestal sometimes). 

Women, though, are quicker to address problems and concerns and will bring them up themselves if they are dissatisfied with something. I often find that guys don't want to make a fuss, or even if they're upset about something they'll have a hard time bringing it to my attention."
"Got a couple. 

When I was 12, I went to the lake with my family and our family friends on a camping trip.  One day, all of us kids are swimming in the lake off the docks.  I get out of the water to go to the refreshment stand for a coke and within minutes I have watery blood streaming down my inner thighs.  It wasn’t my first period, maybe my third...I just didn’t know how to chart my cycle and prepare.  I distinctly remember feeling like I was living in one of those embarrassing stories they published in Seventeen or Sassy magazine at the time.

Then there was the time that my best guy friend who I had a crush on came to the house to hang out and my brother showed him my diary and read passages out loud to him.  

Cringing and wincing so hard right now."
Date night/ going to parties  slowly becomes obsolete and you just wanna order in and watch tv instead.
"Anyone that controlling is doing more than just texting her a lot. He’d likely already separated her from her support network and kept control of her finances, and there may have been physical violence. If not, almost certainly the threat of it. It’s not easy or simple to walk away from an abusive relationship, and leaving itself is dangerous. I hope she got out safely. "
"Officially, we moved in together after 6 months. In reality, we did that almost immediately. 

We’d met at a party at my dorm complex, and ended up in my room. I actually expected it to be just a nice one night stand. But then he showed up the next day, and we went to his apartment to watch movies. Or have sex, with movies playing in the background. 

Then he caught the flu, so naturally, I visited him to nurse him back to health. Then my dorm was being renovated and they turned off the water, so I stayed at his place, to enjoy the working toilet. 
After 6 months, we felt that the rent for my dorm was money wasted, and I moved into his place officially. All in all, I spent maybe two weeks in that dorm after meeting him. We’ve been together for ten years now. "
It would be awful  
"it's often these small things, i've found. and you're made to feel ridiculous for ''overreacting'' even though you're certain it's something deeper. don't blame yourself.

one time, i had to end a date early because this okay dude hit an insect in a way i didn't like. i know that sounds crazy, everyone hates bugs right? but his face twisted in this really disturbing angry way and he slapped at this tiny little gnat with such violence that i just immediately had to nope out. and even i had the hardest time justifying to myself that it was a valid reason, let alone to tell a friend!
"
"When I was in 6th grade, I had an incident. In our homerooms we have our own desks but we stack our chairs at the end of the day. Well, when I got home, I found out I had bleed through my pants so bad it had like a butterfly pattern to it. I was mortified, and was certain someone had to have noticed because it was that bad!

Well the next day, we all got our chairs, and one kid said 'I got red paint on mine!' And proceeded to sit in my blood :0 omg omg omg. I regret that day immensely. "
"A therapist of mine once gave me a great calming/grounding method that hasn't failed me. Of course this would be hard to use in some situations and does take a fair bit of time to go through. Anytime I can feel a panic/anxiety attack coming on I focus on my senses to draw my attention away from what I'm thinking. 

What's one thing you can taste right now?  (Even if it's just your own saliva lol, what does it taste like? the small piece of chocolate you ate ten minutes ago, gum? Etc.)

What's two things you can smell right now? (The scent of detergent on your clothes, your deodorant, hand lotion, a candle, etc.)

What's three things you can hear right now?  (Whirring of a fan, rain, faint bird calls, fish tank in the next room over etc.)

What's four things you can feel right now? (The chair you're sitting in, the fuzzy socks you're wearing, the cool metal of your watch, etc.)

What's five things you can see right now? (Literally anything you can see, like eye spy but kindof opposite and by yourself)

And if I need to I can reassess the situation after with a clearer mind. Of course it might not work for everyone but this technique has helped me a lot so why not share it 😊 hope it helps"
"My husband stays at home with the baby because it makes the most sense. I work in an office, he has a creative job that allows him to work mostly from home as little or as much as he wants. Yes, he takes him to the park, does most of the shopping, does more around the house than me.

 It’s not a weird dynamic among the urban liberal bubble we’re in, but apparently it’s an alien concept outside of it. Like he should go get a lower paying job outside the house so I can stay at home so we can be Real Man and Real Woman? Fuck off."
"Being sick is my normal. 

So when I look like I’m having a good day I actually feel like I have the flu/got run over by a bus, but I’m use to it so I just act normally. The only time people can tell I’m having a very bad day is when my skin flares up. "
"Are you saying that he didnt say ""i love you"" to her, for years? And when he did, he dumped her the next morning? 
How could someone be with a guy for *years* without hearing the other person ever say ""i love you""? That's not a relationship. "
"They can have all the opinions they want, but they shouldn't get to control or legislate the bodies of people with uteri."
I met my husband at work. I know so stereotypical. We got to be good friends. After about three months of working together he told me about separating from his wife. Still platonic friends until one night when he asked me if he could kiss me. I said no. Two weeks later I changed my mind and told him to ask me again. Twenty seven years later we are preparing to celebrate our twenty fifth wedding anniversary in May. Good luck Sweetie. There is someone for everyone.

My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them, or as an invitation to intimacy. Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can.

"It's 2 things: 1 being taken out of context to justify another. 

There is a lot of evidence, both anecdotal, and studied that women are disproportionately hard on other women in specific contexts. But more importantly there are a lot of people who are either actively misogynistic, or are otherwise equitable, but uncomfortable confronting the inherently sexist inequalities of our society. 

To this large group of people, the narrative that hatred towards women isn't a problem, isn't a serious problem, or is mostly a problem of women against women is appealing. Through this narrative they can justify their own action or inaction because it tells them they are not the problem.

EDIT: I may have spoken without adequate evidence on my first point. My apologies. See response by /u/whoop_there_she_is for a good rebuttal."

"If you're talking about the front page post that ""proved"" that women face more interpersonal conflict with other women than with men, that was a load of baloney. It only rated *perceptions* of interpersonal conflict, among a small sample size of young women, and the study hasn't been peer-reviewed or replicated for accuracy. Their conclusion that women are actually more hostile to other women is not found at all in the analysis, only that women are more perceptive to interpersonal conflict (with both women and men) but didn't test those variables properly. Which makes sense, because women are taught to be more sensitive to other peoples' feelings. No study has ever proven that women are more hostile or create conflicts disproportionally with other women."
"My dad was a single father of 3 teenagers when my mom left him for my best friend's dad. He went to every game or competition each of us had, picked us up at every practice, helped us with homework, kept the house tidy, supported us through break ups, made family movie nights where we'd go buy junk food and pizza and fight over what we'd watch (He loved Kungfu Panda for some reason). He was our therapist, he helped us through everything. He was our biggest cheerleader. He's the most hardworking, positive man I know. Even after doing all of this, he still managed to complete marathons, triathlons, and do what makes him happy. He's seriously superman. "

"I think people who say that often have one of three agendas:

1. The more innocent one of wanting to feel like they're the norm.

2. The crappy sexual one, where they want to make it ok that men expect threesomes with two women, but won't go the other way.

3. The sad one, where they can't find the courage to identify as bisexual, even though they are.

Either way, it's their own values pushed down on the world, not the reality of it."

"I really think this is the most accurate answer. The claims OP is referencing don't happen the same way in other cultures. 

For example, bisexuality is much more commonly attributed to males in Japan.

In our Puritanical culture, viewing women as more sexually open/available/explorative is common, and ties in with the condemnation of women as sexual beings.

As our society becomes more accepting and sex-positive again, it is easier to allow women into sex positive roles, since they are already blamed (by the Puritanical kinda folk) for being sexual beings.  "
"Had a similar experience with my MIL and husband. I have a history of being verbally abused and take being yelled at really hard. A while back my MIL had had a rough day and saw me upset about something and decided to lay into me for it. She later admitted (to him, not to me, unfortunately) that she was just really tired and stressed and she was mad at herself, and she apologized for it, but I was really messed up about it for days afterward. I even still think about it when my mind wanders.

Anway, a couple days after it happened, I admitted to my husband that I was still thinking about it and trying to figure it out. He talked with me about it for a few hours, and at the end of the conversation he told me that, if it came down to it, he'd pick me over his family every time; that he'd hate to have to make that choice, but that's how he would make it. I don't have any family of my own (long story) and was hoping his family would help fill that void. Then to have his mother treat me how my mother used to really rocked my world. Knowing he'd always be there for me though? The most wonderful thing I've ever known.

I'm so glad you have a partner who stands up for you that way!"

"I was 19 when my mom died, I have two younger sisters, one of which was only 2 years old at the time. I spent so much of my time trying to be strong for them, taking care of my little sister, and really just going from a college student to a full on adult with all sorts of responsibilities I wasn't used to. My friend gave me one night where I felt comfortable enough to just cry, be mad, complain, and feel sorry for myself. I needed it so badly that I felt like a brand new person the next day. 

Also, there was a post I found from Reddit that I still look to this day when I am feeling down. It's honestly the best post I've ever read and I haven't related to any post more since seeing that one. 

Edit: [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/STgL4) is the post I am referring to. "
"As a VERY straight woman this bothers me a lot. No I am not attracted to any woman. No I don't even have any desire to check them out. I don't even like boobs or butts I think they're weird and just blobs of fat. Everything about a man's body I think is amazing though. 


I am happy that others are able to feel more accepted no matter which way they go, but I really hate this stereotype."

"Oooooh!!! This is something I can speak to!!

I had laser hair removal about 10 years ago through a large company that is now out of business (probably because they sucked). It was expensive and didn’t work. The girls who worked there were minimally trained technicians and very unprofessional. One “zapped” my tattoo that wasn’t anywhere near my bikini area and took out a small chunk of skin and ruined my tattoo. I went for several  treatments and I still have all of my hair “down there”. 

Fast-forward about 10 years. Now I’m a nurse and I’ve been trained to do laser hair removal. GO TO SOMEONE WHO IS *DIRECTLY* PHYSICIAN-SUPERVISED and knows what they’re doing.  By directly, I mean that the physician is someone who works in the office, not someone who puts his/her signature on the papers and collects a paycheck. There is a huge difference and I can’t stress this enough. 

Laser hair removal works because the laser is attracted to dark pigments. (This is why when the girl zapped the black part of my tattoo, it took a chunk of skin out). LHR works best on people who are fair-skinned with dark hair. That being said, it will Work on darker-skinned people, but the laser settings have to be different and you have to go for more sessions because of it. It will not work at all on blonde hairs, so no matter where you are lasering, it’s possible to always be left with blonde, fuzzy hair. Don’t get LHR done when you’ve been tanning, for 2 reasons: 1. If you’ve been going and tan and then get another treatment, it’s possible they will burn you (remember your skin will be darker and will “absorb” the laser more) 2. If they do adjust the laser, it won’t work as well as when you had lighter skin and you’ll need more sessions (essentially wasting your money). 

As far as the treatment itself, it feels a bit like a rubber band snap, and you should be pain-free after. Ask the clinic what they use for pain. A nice laser will have a CO2 cooler. These CO2 coolers can be expensive to refill, so some places turn it down which makes the laser sting more. I’d ask in detail about this, myself if I ever got it done again. 

Feel free to message me if you have more questions. "
"I've seen it happen too, and I chalk it up to internalized misogyny. At least in the academic/professional settings I've seen it in.

You go into a group interview, you know three people will be hired. There's 10 men, yourself, and one other women. You've been told your whole life that there's only enough room for the token woman, so if there's going to be *A* woman hired it damn well better be you, not that other one. She's your only competition in that room, not the 10 men.

That isn't necessarily the case, but it certainly feels like it a lot of the times, especially in male dominated spaces. You assume you're going to be compared against the few other women, or that you represent women, and that there can only be One Best Woman."
"This fits my experience.  I can get aroused looking at a beautiful woman, because I imagine being her, and being very desirable, and the idea of being that desirable is arousing.  I don't want to be with her, I want to be her.  That means a wide range of sexual imagery is arousing, but my actual desire is still exclusively heterosexual.  "

Honestly, it doesn't really affect our relationship per se. We still have great quality and very satisfying sex when we do have it, which is priority numero uno for me. Do I wish we could have it a bit more often? Sure, I guess, but that's just life - it's unrealistic to expect that you get 100% of whatever you want whenever you want it. Granted, we do still have a decent frequency in my books - I wouldn't be nearly as accepting of it if we were doing it, say, once a month.

"My sister's ex was/is insane.  She broke up with him, and one night I woke up and heard them both talking outside.  I observed them for a while because he seemed to be angrily saying some shit, and then it looked like he took a swing at her.

I ran downstairs, but she had already come in and locked the door (she later told me she had run to the house, he came up behind her, and she elbowed him in the face).  I made her call 911.

She told me she had woken up and he was standing in her room.  He ""wanted to talk.""  Then they went to the kitchen at some point, where he apparently had taken out a knife and told her to kill him.  Then they went outside, where I heard them.

Police came and got him for drunk driving and domestic violence. Unfortunately couldn't get him for breaking and entering (although the cop really wanted to), but there wasn't any sign of forced entry.

She got a restraining order on him after that, which he violated at least twice.

But *to this day* (it's been *years* - at least 7 or so) he apparently still stalks her social medias and talks shit about her and the guys she dates.  Like.... get the fuck over it, dude.  He apparently has a girlfriend, last I heard.  Don't know if she knows anything about that.... or if she does, which version she knows.... "

"I developed way late. I got my period a month after turning 16 (my mum had taken me to the gyno a few months earlier, since she was worried there was something wrong with me), so I was very self conscious about it. My boobs grew pretty rapidly over that summer, and my body changed a lot. If you look at my quinceañera pictures I look about 5 years younger than all my friends...
Anyways, when I went back to school after summer break, the boys started making comments about my boobs, and how they thought I had had surgery. I was SO confused. I clearly hadn't gotten adjusted to how quickly my body had changed... I honestly thought they were joking because I had no boobs (as they had always done), it was like my brain didn't get that my body was different.
Eventually I started recognizing my body as mine again, but it was a very strange time, and it certainly didn't help that I was being targeted.
Nowadays I feel lucky I got my period that late in life, but at the time I felt like a freak, and worried I might had a chromosomique disorder or something.. "
"Examples with my x boyfriend:

- Man cuts him off in traffic, and he exclaims ""*What a jerk!*""

- Woman cuts him  off in traffic, and he exclaims ""*Women drivers...*""

Men get to be individuals, representing nothing but themself, and not casting a negative light on men as a whole.

It's related to the cries of NOT ALL MEN!!!, when the topic is sexual misconduct.

Women get no such luxury."
"In my experience, it's about the same, but the motivation is different:

- Men do it because it's a convenient way to disregard women.

- Women do it out of an unacknowledged fear of being judged like that, so they seperate themselves from the women who are."
"To add to what the parent commenter just said - what’s changed over the last few years is that the internet is a lot more accessible to all in India. One can get a GB of data a day (yes, a day) for like $6 a month.

Given that India has something like 700 million men (total pop = 1.4 billion), if even half of those could afford mobile internet, and say three quarters of those are what the parent commenter describes, that’s a lot of young men — hundreds of millions — who culturally have no clue about how to speak to women and usually, thanks to culturally enforced inexperience, have no “game”.  But many of these can type in varying levels of English depending on their education and, importantly, unlike China, Facebook, Instagram and other social media properties aren’t blocked in India.

"Treated me like I was still normal, didn't act like things were careening out of control. Took me out to eat, hung out and watched tv with me. And didn't freak out when I'd start crying randomly. Just asked me if I wanted to talk or if I wanted them close or something. 

It also really helps to have someone around who can help you remember to eat, and shower, and help you with chores. Nothing makes grief worse than an overflowing trashcan and weeks of dishes. "

Edit: got a few comments and PMs asking what country. Argentina.

Several friends around the age of 15 got pregnant by their 30+ boyfriends (many were in abusive relationships too) and even though the school knew about it they never called the police or anything. Or if they did the police didn't care because they were ""consenting"". Since their parents never cared who they dated, and the parents are the ones who can say if the teens are consenting or not (really), police don't care."
Are you my ex? 
I was at a gay bar and went to use the restroom. I went to the women’s room and waited in line for a stall cuz that is all we do is wait in line.

"There's so much that often accompanies periods too that guys don't necessarily realise (cramping, migraines, feeling colder than usual, period poops, constant anxiety about leakage, and feeling a need to 'hide' it all because it's not socially acceptable to be open about this really basic biological function for some reason). 

I think there'd be a lot more general awareness and compassion if guys could have a few periods and just get a feel for it."

"You worded the awe I feel when I look back so well. So much going on in her head, around her and only 28 years old. I'm older than she was  I'm just blown away by her grit. 

I was too little to be of help, though I know through her I was able to help a lot as an adult. I was a very self contained child and very independent, and I honestly think it would have been an easy and understandable call if she just kept on as we were without that help. But I experienced a major trauma while on my own at 15-16 and I fell back heavy on things I learned growing up. She really set me up for more. Good job, mom. "
"I am shy. I am not being rude to you, I just have nothing to say. Saying “wow you’re so quiet” doesn’t help. Just let me be who I am, I have enough trouble with that on the best of days without people harping on about how shy I am. "
"I lived with a man for a few months who would put passwords on my phone and laptop so I couldn't talk to other guys. I had to ask for permission to call my mother so he could unlock my phone. Once I was done using the phone or laptop, he'd look through it to make sure I didn't contact anyone. "

"I know for me the sexual aspect of relationships with women that I miss is that the focal point of the sex goes back and forth. With men things are very linear because once PIV starts, typically things don’t go back to focusing on me until he’s done. It’s less that good male lovers treat foreplay as a task to get through and more that the focus of attention switches far less often so it can feel like that."
"I live by the saying: don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. 

Another way of thinking is that you can't give anyone tea if your own is empty. Take care of yourself and then give to others. No one will do it for you and you will be able to give a lot more fully. 

Practice makes perfect."

"None of my exes have been abusive.

One was sweet and soft-spoken. We broke up after a few years because I didn't want to continue dating him. That was high school. One was very charismatic, fit, and intelligent. We broke up after he cheated. He was a great boyfriend otherwise, just horribly bad at ending relationships. One was the kindest person I've ever met, very intelligent, and funny. We broke up because our communication had broken down and we wanted different things at the time. I'm still friends with the second and third exes."
Exactly. I’m wondering if this is just a naive question or if OP is super morbid. 
"Maybe not in just long term, but I was surprised how much I wanted and needed physical touch. I can't stop. "
"Definitely not all guys, there are plenty out there who are fully capable of realizing women are regular people just like them."
"If we’re being honest, I tried to kill myself while we were dating because of the abuse. If I had married him, there’s no doubt in my mind that I would be dead. 

Wow. That was incredibly morbid. "
Throughout my twenties I became more confident and more sure of myself. It was gradual. I asserted myself more. I didn't allow people to walk all over me. I spoke up when I didn't like what was going on. I didn't allow the people in my life to speak for me. I didn't change myself to fit into others' ideals of who I should be. I didn't really realize I had been doing that until I stopped doing that.
"My mother talks about this sometimes.  She was a smoking hot bombshell most of her life, well into her late forties even after birthing 5 children. Just an exceptional beauty.  Now in her mid sixties,  she's still beautiful but in her mind has lost her ""sex appeal"". She's embraced aging and loves being a ""granny"", but sometimes laments her boobs shrinking and becoming flat,  getting very thin and losing her curves,  and her hair becoming more dull. She takes very good care of herself and looks better than any other sixty somethings I know,  but it's not like it was when she was younger.  

She's happily married to my father so it's not as though she's trying to attract people,  but I think she misses being hot shit. Being sexy was such a huge part of her identity. "
"Pros - it's easier to maintain my figure, I think I'm taken more seriously in a lot of situations

Cons - dating problems (being a gangly awkward teenager taller than all the boys is no fun, y'all), when I was younger it was really hard for me to feel feminine, I always have to think twice about wearing heels, it can be hard to fit into things when it comes to leg room, clothes shopping is a nightmare"
"I do!  We’ve all been friends since we were 11/12 years old.  We’ve been to each other’s weddings (and, in some cases, subsequent divorces).  We see each other’s babies (well, for one lady!  She has two.  The rest of us play Aunt).  We call each other when we’re distressed or excited.

Any time I go back to my hometown, I like to squeeze in a visit with at least one of them.  We all sort of scattered to the four winds post-undergrad, but whenever any of us are in town, we like to check in.

I’m actually having dinner tonight with one of them since she’s in MY town for work."
"You know, I used to wish I was taller. Over time, I’ve come to enjoy being short. I’m compact. I fit comfortably into tight spaces. When people talk about aches and pains due to bad legroom in cars or airplanes I’m like “seemed pretty luxurious to me.” There’s lots of room in our bed for our cats (my SO is also short). I can do that squat sit thing that most tall people seem horrified by. 

Cons? Most women’s pants aren’t sold in varying lengths, so they are pretty much always way too long. The other thing is — being short, I’ve found personally, people tend to see you as “cute” more than “sexy” or elegant or whatever. That’s not a big deal, but at some point I realized guys saw me as sort of elfin and adorable and sometimes I wanted to look more like, sleek and powerful. 

And some clothing styles are just... out of the question, because they make me look like a stump."
"Creepy people display things like:

1. A feeling of entitlement
2. Crossing personal boundaries
3. Crossing social boundaries and norms
4. Ignoring expressions of discomfort or disinterest
5. Persistence after refusal
6. Ignoring lack of consent/not seeking to get consent before acting
7. Attempts to manipulate
8. Aggression
9. Touching inappropriately
10. Reacting with bitterness/negativity/anger when you don't respond the way they want you to

Flirting doesn't do those things. Flirting is mutual interest that is mutually expressed with respect for the other person. Flirting that crosses the lines for creepiness is no longer flirty \- it's creepy."
"Yes, but I didn't say anything overt to her because I knew she wouldn't hear it. He ended up being a rank nasty creep who cheated on her (truly amazing that he managed to find two women to think he was worth giving even the time of day) and since she's moved on she's been really good about seeking perspectives on shitty behavior and actually doing something about it. I'm proud of her."

"Not a club, but Dave n busters. Was walking by the bar on the way to the game area in the back. Some guy was sitting on a stool facing the tv screens above the bar. His stool was set by the railing. He was sitting at least 5 ft behind the people sitting at the bar. I’m watching the tv screens as I’m walking by and suddenly the guy, out of no where projectile vomits a stream of puke and hits the people sitting 5ft in front of him at the bar. Lots of screaming and the guy falls to the floor. Ambulance was called. But for reals, I’d never seen vomit travel so far. "
"Yes. I told my friend and she continued dating him for 2 years and finally broke up with him. I was definitely right. Lol the great thing is that he’s a massive homophobe, and my friend is now in a wonderful loving relationship with another woman. "

I’m standing there, toe to toe with him. After the 50th time I tell him I was just with my mom, he decided he’d had enough. Hauled off and clocked me a good one. Broke my face. I was so stunned I didn’t know what to do. Then I did. I beat the living shit out of him. And sorta threw him down a flight of stairs.  He spent a week in the hospital. Broken jaw, broken occipital bone, three fractured ribs and a broken leg. You do not hit me. "
"We were great together and we were comfortable with each other.  He was there for me for one of the hardest bits in my life.  But one day he decided since he'd been with only me, he was missing out and wanted to ""enjoy life"" before settling down.  Plot twist that didn't work out so well for him but whatever.  Better that it happened before we got married!"
"No, this is Patrick."
"Dark sense of humour and a strong dislike of cheesecake. If you like it you can have my lifetime share but fuck off, it tastes like used socks and has a mouthfeel of solidified beef tallow."
"Phoebe trying to seduce Chandler before he cracks and admits “I can’t have sex with you, because I’m in love with Monica.”

I turn it off after that though, because the ensuing “I love you”s are too much. Yuck."
I would love to dedicate a significant portion of my time and money to the stop of human trafficking.
"Thanks for this opportunity! I'm taking a REALLY hard chem class, for which an A is an 85. The class average for our first exam was a 57, and there were only 5 As awarded out of 60 students.

That was exactly my thought when I saw this. I wondered if the women there weren't afraid of that."
"Go to school for ten years and specialize in antique document maintenance and the second I get my hands on it, start running."
I broke up with a guy because he would always ask me if I was on my period if I seemed anything less than 100% happy. He also happened to be one of the most immature people I've ever met in my life.

"In a bar around 9pm, drunk girl falling into guys, grabbing their hands and trying to have them grab her vage.

Cons: ROMPERS JUST DONT WORK LIKE WHAT"
"I was walking downtown a few years ago when two dudes in a truck started cat calling me.  It started with them making comments about my legs.  I flipped them off and kept walking.  They proceeded to follow me for several blocks,  whistling and making sexual comments. One of them even took his shirt off and was hanging out the window. All of this without me saying a word to either of them.   I turned around and snapped a picture,  they speed off. The idiots were in their work vehicle,  so I called the owner to tell him what happened.  He was *furious*. He apologized profusely and called me several hours later to assure me he had fired and to thank me for reporting them.  "
"I've got some great exes who are just generally super nice guys who just had different goals and dreams for the future that didn't jive with mine, or were better suited with other people than me.   I'm friendly with all but one of my exes, honestly.  It doesn't happen over night but with time and distance, and if the circumstances of the breakup are amicable enough, you can keep some people in your lives."
"How much you’re interested in him makes a difference.

But in general, creeps:

1. Use the same tactics and lines on multiple people 

2. Are in it for the pussy, not because they give a single shit about getting to know a person 

3.  Don’t take a ‘no’ very well 
"
"Stayed the same.  It's not like there are many women out there who are shocked by the stories.

Shitty guys are still shitty.

Good guys are still good."
"I can't say I was ever *explicitly* told that, no. I mean, that'd be pretty damn brazen sexism to have it said out loud, wouldn't it?

But it's in the images you see, in the real life examples you're exposed to. There's the One Cool Girl in the group of guy friends. The One Woman Boss trying to keep up with the other bosses. The photos of diversity in the textbooks were a white boy, black boy, white boy in wheelchair, Asian boy, and one white girl. The action movies are elite squads of men and the One Tough Woman. Even the heroines in our children's stories are the lone girl with her guy buds (eg: Hermione, Harry, and Ron).

I *was* often told that girls have to work harder and do better to prove themselves against the boys. Which combined with the examples around me just sort of coalesced into the idea that being a successful girl is an elite position. And elite things aren't open to large numbers of people.

Plus, at least when I was a kid, we were only just getting The First Woman ____ for so many things. Which meant not that there could only be one, but that there hasn't been any. If someone has yet to be the First Woman on the Moon, then you certainly aren't dreaming of being ""one of the women who go to the moon"", you know? It's a concept out of reach."
"There's something about the [fighting becomes sex scene](https://youtu.be/88_6Be0Evm0?t=1h13m14s) in Mr &amp; Mrs Smith that I love. Violence, passion, and great songs all in one."
"Machu Picchu. I was dreading the crowds and it's really expensive to get to and I just went cause I would probably never be in Peru again and felt obligated. 

But wow. It was seriously so magical. The extra effort was 100% worth it cause sitting high in the mountains with that view with my husband was unreal. I definitely recommend it! "
"Still together. I say kind of regret it because he's a good person and a very caring, respectful, and compassionate lover. Our sexual compatibility was always fine. But we have found ourselves in a situation where, due to medical issues, what we can do in the bedroom is now extremely limited. It's technically sex, and we can both get off, but it's not fun. I can't lose myself in the moment anymore. So here I am in my early 30's and basically celibate. 

If I'd had other sex partners, I'd probably appreciate him more. Or at least I wouldn't feel like I made this choice to only be with him, and it resulted in my life now. I can't help but have that foolish ""put all my eggs in this basket"" feeling."
"I had a horribly traumatic childhood. My mom was a hoarder, my older brother was abusive towards my mom, and I moved 9 times by the time I was 10 years old. 

My mom passed away when I was 11 after a two year battle with lung cancer. I was moved across the country to live with my Godparents. 

After going through that amount of change I have horrible anxiety, issues opening up, and struggle with depression. 

My husband has been my absolute savior. He sits with me for up to three hours at a time talking about my feelings, and has convinced me that my emotions do matter. He makes sure that I feel safe and secure.

His patience is the best thing that has ever happened to me. "
"Never thought I wanted kids, then I turned 35 and suddenly was scared I would miss out by not being a mom.  Had my first and only child at 36. Im 43 now.  It's strange seeing so many of my  high school classmates becoming grandparents. I'm so glad I waited until I was older."
"I was really really into Cricket growing up (still am), and everyone thought it was weird.  
In England, especially London, Cricket is seen as an upper-class thing other than for Asians. And I was this working class white blonde girl who used to memorise stats from Wisden. Ended up bonding with a lot of Asian girls though, still friends with a bunch of them.

Oh and I hate babytalk, like with SOs and pets etc. More than one boy has told me that it's weird. I just find it cloying.

"I’m Ukrainian living in the States. My sister in Ukraine gets more of these requests than I do, because I think the bias that we’re easy pretty much extends beyond and probably goes up in believability the whiter one is. I don’t think it’s just for Americans.

Also, Turkish requests are just as annoying and common for anyone with a Russian-sounding name (maybe American/European too, unsure). The Indian men can take a back seat to their repulsive messages compared to what we get from Turkish dudes.

Edit: I’m not sure but guessing that Asian women get lost of messages from creepy American/European dudes ... I feel like this is just the way the world is for us, yet another way to get creeped out, regardless of nationality."
"I had a *really* difficult day at work and completely forgot we had a date scheduled. I got home very late and he was sitting down outside my apartment door, nodding off, bouquet of flowers on his lap. My heart sank and I woke him up ready to apologize profusely. I was ready for him to be rightfully pissed, because I would've been. 

Instead he asked if I was all right, and when he saw how defeated I was feeling, gave me a bear hug and offered to reschedule. I had no idea how much I needed that support, because I immediately started crying, while also trying to make out with him and take his clothes off. After the best and most therapeutic sex cry of my life, he drew me a bath and we just chilled together in the tub. 

That day I realized that no matter what I do or how ""crazy"" I act, he'll just roll with it. He loves me, and that's that. It's a kind of complete acceptance I'd never experienced before in my life. "
idk y I open these threads 
"One of my exes used to do IT work for a state correctional facility and somehow still had access to the police phone tracking software. For the first 2 months of our relationship he tracked my every move 24/7 and I didn't find out about it until shortly before I finally left him. He defended himself by saying he's been cheated on before and wanted to make sure I was ""legit"". Ironic, considering he cheated on me pretty much nonstop the whole time. Pretty tame compared to some of the stories here but it really freaked me out. "
"Women are shown as beautiful and superior in the media and also they are shown as recieving affection. Valentine's day. If no one does anything who is in trouble? The man. I think in Canada at least there is the underlying message that men are worthless and ugly and women are beautiful and precious. No one actually thinks this, but it's there. So it's generally not seen as a problem when a woman gets angry if she doesn't get presents. This empowers women to state their terms. I don't like the stereotypes. I hate that our culture has such a double standard. But at least the type of woman I like feels comfortable enough to be honest and straight forward. I feel bad for men though. So many men I know feel inherently undesirable. Just because they are men. It breaks my heart. "
Same here - no regrets!
"It depends on where you are, but commonly people wear black to funerals, so that might have something to do with it. Other than that the only other colour that's taboo for a wedding is white which is usually reserved for the bride."
"For me, it's random friend request from brand new FB accounts for military guys.  "
"&gt; how the FUCK do you not know to walk away after a comment like that?

I know, right? I wanted to shake her by the shoulders. That particular thing happened when we were on vacation. We were on the beach in Miami, my mom, me, and my sister, and my mom was just like ""LOL HE ASKED FOR TOPLESS PICS OF US!! ALL OF US!!! HAHA"" my sister and I were like... what? wtf?

After her divorce she went a lil crazy but she seems to have evened out now...."
"Judge me like crazy, but...the buildup to the Dirty Dancing sex scene. "
"The transition from the honeymoon phase to the next level can be panic-inducing and confusing, especially when you don't have prior relationship experience. Sometimes it's difficult to tell if it's just the end of the honeymoon phase or the beginning of your break-up."
Any butch lesbian will tell you some men will try their hardest to make it sexy for them anyway.
"The obvious answer is peeing wherever. I hate needing to pee on a nature walk or during a night on the town. God I would love to be able to whip it out and pee nonchalantly. I have to crouch under some random tree and it just looks really bad!

I want men who have peed in public to try it in a woman's body and be judged by onlookers lol."
I find the opposite can be an indicator too. There's nothing that screams that two people are struggling than an influx of staged and loved up photos plastered all over social media. 
"I remember a thread about charcoal powder awhile back. For what it's worth, here is what a dental student said about it: 

""Dental student here -- Please, please, please stop using charcoal to 'whiten' your teeth. It is highly abrasive and simply rubs away the outer surface of your teeth (enamel). If you use it too much, it can result in sensitivity, an increased risk for cavities, and actually make your teeth appear more yellow. This is because while the outer layer of your teeth (enamel) has a white sheen, the layer underneath (dentin) is quite yellow. If you scrub away the enamel, all you have is yellow dentin!""

EDIT: 
Some more info from from the ADA's (AMerican Dental Association) blog: 
https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/w/natural-teeth-whitening

As well as an actual an actual dentist, with interesting links to the Journal of American Dental Association: 
https://www.drjosephhaddad.com/blog/is-diy-teeth-whitening-with-activated-charcoal-safe-effective/

I should add, I'm not knocking it; I've never tried it. However it is something I looked into and researched extensively because I had bulimia for years and it ruined my teeth, so I'm very careful about what I treat them with now. The general consensus I've read and heard from dental professionals is that it's probably not the safest way to whiten teeth. That's all. "
"Oh my gosh, thats terrible.."
"When I saw how quickly he became friends with my mom and brothers, and the respect he gave them. 

My ex was kind of rude to my family, and it always bothered me, though I could never really articulate it. My mom is very religious and my ex was aggressively atheist, to the point where religion made him angry, so my mom would make him angry simply by believing her beliefs. One of my brothers has Asbergers and my ex never knew how to handle it, and the other one is 5 years younger than me and my ex just never really treated him with kindness.

I still remember one of the first times my SO came over. He carried my mom's groceries, taught football to my youngest brother, and sat and talked about movies for an hour with the other one. My heart was so full. Three years later and my mom is still in awe of how sweet he is, and my brothers both consider him to be a close friend. :) "
"Dude I hooked up with a couple of times at college messaged me years later and said he wished we could do it one more time. My profile picture is me and my boyfriend of 4 years and his is of him and his girlfriend of 4 years. Since I’m not a bag of garbage, I was sending my BF screenshots of the whole conversation as it happened. He sent the screenshots to fuckboy’s girlfriend. "
"Just in case you're not aware: /r/JustNoMil !

"Pros:
- Gives you treats every morning. 

- Gullible. You can have fun making her think you want cuddles only to bite instead. 

- Will adjust her body around where you sleep on the bed no matter how uncomfortable.

- You will be spoiled.

Cons:

- Face kisses. Ugh.

- Comes home smelling like other cats?!? Often several times a week.

- Has a job so she leaves. How dare she "
"That scene is awesome. But their kiss at the bar, where he lifts her up just a little, makes me swoon every time. I think that is the hottest first kiss of any movie."
"My ex raped me after he found out I said ""hi"" to a guy I knew from school when I saw him at the train station.

My other ex beat me to a pulp when he found out I went to a male doctor."
Right?! It blew me away. 
"Honestly, sounds like you're also a pretty awesome friend. You did a shitty thing, but you communicated about it really well."
"She sounds amazing, and with a deep, deep well of love for you. You mean so much to her that she would go to battle - even with herself - for you to make sure you had everything you needed. She's incredible"
"I used to work at a fine dining restaurant and we had one guy, fantastic guy, who would only take certain tables. As a hostess, you did not seat him in rotation. He had maybe 5-6 regulars and that was it. Guy. Made. Bank. One of his regulars picked up a hospital bill for him once, something like $2-3k."
"Yeah, I don't know why everyone here acts like all women have to get along. There's some women I can stand, some I can't. Just like there's some men I can tolerate and some I can't. 

I shouldn't have to like someone just because we share a gender"
gaslighting is where you're manipulating someone in such a way that it makes them question their own sanity. Real fucked up shit.
"Not to sound conceited (because genetics did all the work), but I like *everything* about my physical appearance."
"My mom used to do that, too! Every time something would happen that she considered a “growing up” milestone (shaving, first period, first boyfriend, first thong, etc.) she’d immediately call all my grandparents and aunts and uncles and tell them. She genuinely didn’t see anything wrong with it until I screamed at her one day for it.😒"
"Clean his home, grocery shop and prep his meals/fridge when he's working weekends. Replace his worn out/empty things without a word. Read his body language and follow suit with my mood when he needs it (ie. when he has an anxiety attack I know he needs pleasant silence to calm down). 

Full body messages, actively listening in conflict and in the info-dumping sessions about his passions, refreshing his drinks, bringing sound advice, acknowledgment, bringing small gifts of things I know he'll love.. just about everything in a relationship, even down to the kisses on the back of his neck while he cooks, is about showing love, isn't it?"
"I feel for you, almost the same thing happened to me. I was in 7th grade and completely unused to having a period (I think it had only happened once before and not at school). It soaked through my shorts. Unfortunately, the other kids noticed before I did. A girl eventually comes up to me and tells me what's happened and says everybody's talking about it. Needless to say I got with the program after that."
Neck kisses. Holy jeez.
"CICO (counting calories) daily (I use Myfitnesspal)

Eating more veggies

Visiting r/loseit everyday to celebrate and commiserate with others also trying to lose weight

I'm 50 lbs down with 40 more to go"
"Yes. My friend got into a relationship with this guy who everyone said was really cool and chill but idk I just had this bad feeling about. He seemed nice enough in social situations but he got quite paranoid/angry with her whenever she mentioned any of her exes or really any other guy. They ended up moving in quite quickly because he needed a place to live, but he didn’t appear to have a job and spent most of his time getting High and playing video games whilst she worked and paid all the bills and did all the cooking/cleaning.

Eventually one night they got into an argument when we were out and she bumped into one of her exes. She took him home and I heard that afterwards he went round this guys house and beat him up. Idk why but he did end up getting in trouble with the law. She tried to defend him and stick with him but eventually case to her senses and left him."
"the complications of weed. it's not harmless for everyone, it's not a cure-all, and can even cause the opposite intended effects for some people. i lost a cousin to marijuana induced psychosis.

a much better approach: try it with doctor's guidance. if it doesn't work or makes you worse, stop doing it. and for the love of god, if everyone around you could leave it at that instead of keeping up with ''well you know there are different ways to take it, and did you know there are different var-'' STOP. it's not for EVERYONE!"
"I'm the oldest, so tons.  He had a later curfew, was allowed to have girlfriends over way younger than I could have boyfriends, and by the time he was 14 or so the parents had totally given up on trying to wake us on the weekend."
I burped really loudly. He looked at me and burped even louder. Then we high fived and made out.
"Huge red flag. 

When I'd push her on it she would assure me that, ""I know he loves me, he doesn't have to say it.""

I do know another couple who is getting married and have possibly said ""I love you"" only a handful of times in the 7 years they've been together, but that is purely cultural. 

This was him stringing her along.

Can't explain why saying ""I love you"" led to him breaking things off with her. Maybe he realized he really did, and couldn't stand that he was cheating on someone he loved? I have no idea. But he's gone now."
She is funny and smart and kind. We broke up because we moved to different parts of the country and we didn't want to do the long distance thing. 
"""You're so funny!""

Or, just sexy. ""You're so sexy"". 

Edit: Forgot, ""You give the best blowjobs!"" I think every guy says this because they want one. "
Pads and tampons.   Never found a store brand that has the same quality/feel.  The pads always feel crinkly.

"I didn’t realize that hips came with puberty. They developed a lot sooner than the rest of my body, and a lot sooner than it did for other kids. I remember being on the monkey bars (which were very small) I was doing a trick and my hips managed to get stuck, just a little. I just had to angle myself to get through rather than just being able to go straight through like my friends.

Well, that started the teasing. I was made fun of for being fat (I’ve never put on any weight) and having a big butt. I didn’t know any better and thought that was true and I remember trying to eat less to lose the ‘weight’.

Thankfully my body evened out and everything is a lot more proportional now. 

"
I didn’t realize how much my space meant to me before we moved in together. I went from having “my space” to “our space” and that took a little while to get used to. I love getting to wake up next to my best friend instead of waking up by myself.

"Heard about? Raped and murdered her, murdered her kids. And I'm not talking about a single incident.

Experienced? My ex got jealous I said hi to his cousin (as is normal when you PASS BY SOMEONE YOU KNOW) so he hit me with the metal in his belt until I was bleeding from everywhere, threw me on the floor, kicked my ribs until I couldn't breathe, then grabbed me and choked me with the belt until I was unconscious."
My daughter is a two year old T1D and some days she is just not in the mood to be messed with. I have to constantly remind other people that on top of being a toddler and learning how to deal with her feelings she might feel like crap but not even know how to communicate it exactly yet. She will tell me she needs to rest or get belly is grumpy but I'm sure that's not even scratching the surface some days 😔

Face blindness.  I thought I was the only one who had trouble recognizing the people in my life.  People will come up and talk to me and I will bluff my way through the conversation until I get enough clues about who the person is - someone I know from my gym?  Neighbor?  Old coworker?  I thought either I have a terrible memory or I’m self absorbed.  But then [Brad Pitt gave an interview] (http://www.medicaldaily.com/brad-pitt-says-he-has-face-blindness-prosopagnosia-more-common-thought-246184) talking about how he has it.  1/50 people have it to some degree.

"Words of affirmation is way above all others according to the quiz and it didn't shock me.  I can be pretty happy as long as I know I am valued and appreciated.  I don't want flowery shit said to me, I want things you mean.  I want to be told *why* I matter, what about me is special to you, that you notice the things I do for you, and why you love me.  I would so much rather have that than a gift or such.  I also know quality time matters, but sometimes we cannot control for that, or even for touch (though I like touch too).  Lives can be busy, travel might happen, and in those cases time and touch won't even be possible, but I *can* still feel very loved through words.  

In my heart, it feels like at telling me I matter isn't asking for all that much at all and if *feels* amazing to hear it.  I don't even care much for acts of service (though I appreciate it).  Gifts is something that can feeling loving *if* it's very personal and specific.  I don't want more stuff just to have it.  I do love receiving something that is really thoughtful and shows you know me or have listened when I mentioned liking something.  Or sex toys.  I do like those too. ;)"
ooooooooooooooOOOOOoooOOOOOooooOOooooo
"I use Burt’s bees cuticle cream and I randomly ask my friends if they want some. 
I don’t think they realize I use it so I don’t pick at my fingers and bite my nails 
Saying “do you want cuticle cream” really eagerly is pretty weird honestly lol "
"Acts of service, probably, or quality time. 

Words of affirmation is the least important. Actions speak louder than words. "
"Gonna get downvoted, but same here. Women are quite capable of being cruel and/or abusive to other women, it's not really a rare thing. And in my experience, I've gotten more trouble from other women than from men."
"Dissociation. Even finding out there was a word for it was mind-blowing, as I've been experiencing it since I was very young. Before I knew that I would just describe it as either ""I start seeing in too much detail and I can't tell what existence is anymore"" or ""my head is a video camera that I'm inside of""."
"I’m not lazy, some days I literally do not have the energy to accomplish the simplest tasks. 

I do not want your advice about what worked for your uncle’s friend’s grandmother’s neighbor. 

Don’t get mad when I say I can’t do something or don’t want to go or have to cancel. 
Trust me I’m already mad at myself that I had to cancel again. I don’t need someone else mad at me too. 

Do some simple research. It can make a world of difference in understanding what I and others go through. 

Don’t try to sell me some bs MLM crap. Snake oil isn’t a cure all 💁🏻‍♀️

"Cons

I have never been approached by men. I've always had to approach men I'm interested in - not an issue anymore since I met my husband.

People always seem to point it out, how tall I am. I work as a medical receptionist, and I've had a woman burst into hysterical laughter when I stood up because she couldn't believe how tall I was. It's weirdly degrading to have people constantly comment on it, and it's been a general insecurity of mine - so this occasion was especially unwelcome.

Pants. Stores generally don't carry pants in long sizes (at least where I shop), so I generally shop in the men's section for pants.

I like heels, but don't like wearing them because it makes me stand out even more. 

Pros

I can reach everything."
yeah he likes *only* dudes. I made sure by literally virtually stalking him for like 6-7 months lol. I'm not proud of that but he's such a nice person and I guess I really wanted it to be a lie.  
"Everything. 

I've been pooped on doing someone's backside."
"I hate the cold and winter, but I love the occasional snow day (we live in the south so not too many). "
