"I was 16 and got off at the wrong bus stop. A man who had been staring at me, muttering and snapping his fingers got off at the last minute with his massive suitcase. I got a bad feeling and took off running towards a bar at the end of the street and the scariest moment of my life is hearing those suitcase wheels speeding up behind me and his feet hitting the pavement. 

Luckily for me the bouncer at the bar was helpful and told creepy guy to turn around and walk the other way. Creepy guy tries to convince him that we knew each other and were just having an argument. 
Bouncer doesn’t care and asks a couple of his friends to follow this guy and make sure he doesn’t turn around and come back towards me. 

That unknown bouncer is on my list of heroes. "
"my friend went to school with a very, very sweet and kind girl from a wealthy family. one day she invited everybody out to an expensive place, and friend had to say she couldn't go because she couldn't afford it. the girl casually suggested asking her parents for money, and then her world apparently came crashing down as she sweetly asked how it's possible to not have money, how does such a thing even happen? and was she *sure* her parents didn't have money?"
My roommate in college asked me if $3k was too much to spend on a sundress. I told her that I could buy a car for that amount.
Took about fifteen minutes into our date to tell me he had a problem with masturbation addiction and then told me he hopes a lot of people see us together and he can't wait to 'show me off'.
"I used to work at a bakery so I'd have to leave my home at like 4am to get to work. I'd always ""wake up"" my husband to say bye I love you. He would say the most ridiculous stuff and never remember. My fav was one morning he wouldn't stop smiling so I ask him why he was smiling and he said ""I'm thinking of things that are red"" and that was it."
"if you're completely honest with yourself, this person wouldn't even be a good friend. time together with them is strained and unnatural. your time together consists only of sex, watching movies/TV, playing games together not because it's valuable bonding time, but because it's a distraction from the underlying discomfort and being on a different wavelength. stuff like going to dinner without distractions is outright painful."
"I gave a friend a ride to this local shopping centre and she asked if she could leave her bag in my car. I said sure put it in the back. She asked why she couldn't just leave it on the passenger seat. I was confused but explained it might make the car a target for theft and she was like, ""but... How can someone get into a locked car?"" Like she seriously had no idea that breaking into a car was a thing or that people might steal things out of cars."
"I went on one spectacularly awful date. One of the first things he told me was that he couldn’t remember the last time he showered (yes, pal, I noticed). He also told me multiple stories of police mistaking him for a homeless person, and showed me a tattoo on his upper inner thigh (he had easy access to this, thanks to the jorts he was wearing) of a hot dog. 

The best part of the tattoo was that he got it because a restaurant offered free hot dogs to anyone who did so. Then, the place closed down. He said it like a punch line, I lost it laughing, he did not understand why that was funny. 

He ended the night telling me he kind of had a girlfriend. There were no hard feelings over that fact. "
"I stay away from those areas on Reddit. 

No one I know in real life is like that, which helps. "
"A few years ago I’d walk by this homeless woman every morning, and she was always asking for money for a cup of coffee.

One cold morning I felt really bad for her, so I decided to give her some change I had in my pocket. That’s when she decided to pull a knife on me and demand all my money. "
"One time I was on the bus in my early 20’s and this creeper sat right next to me on a nearly empty bus, which you know always sets off alarms! THEN he tried to put his hand on my leg. I slapped his hand a loudly said, “what the fuck are you doing?” I got up to move, but my stop was also coming up. There was a bar right at the stop, which was a street over from my apartment building. I got off the bus and they guy followed me, and I just ducked under the awning of the entrance to the bar and stood next to the bouncer as I said, “I’m just going to stand here for bit.” He said, “cool” then saw they guy. He puffed up and took a step away from the door towards bus creeper. The guy from the bus immediately turned around and hightailed it out of there. I felt comfortable after that, and I was going to walk the block over to my building which had a doorman, but the bouncer insisted on he and I going inside to get the bar manager to walk me over to my building. I felt a little silly because the creepy guy was clearly gone and would have had to walk back past the bounce to get to me, but he &amp; the manager insisted. Maybe they were doing it to just cover their asses legally, but I still thought it was really nice.  Instead of feeling like the world is full of scary people after that experience I was reminded there are good people out there willing to help drop kick the weirdos back to whatever dark hole they belong in. 

Shoutout to all the scowling bouncers hangin out in front of city bars!  :)"
Coming on Reddit to get opinions from others (because you know something doesn’t feel right)
"My husband talks in his sleep a lot, but my favorite is when he rolled over and told me, ""Not to go out there, the bad guys are out there and we need a plan.""

I played along and said, ""What kind of bad guys?""

And he sighed and said, ""Didn't you read the briefing?""

I said, ""No, I never read them. I just freestyle it.""

And he just sighed and rolled over again.

"
You can't expect a guy like that to be single.
" I've found it to be relatively accurate in my personal experience. In my experience with the men and women I have spoken to about this, when many men say they are ""afraid"" of women, what they mean is that they are afraid of how women will affect their self\-esteem, social standing, or financial standing, but when many women say they are ""afraid"" of men, what they mean is they are afraid that men will assault, rape, or kill them. "
"I met a woman in the Navy who did not know penises could go into vaginas.  She legitimately thought it was a hotdog bun type situation and there was only a big enough opening when babies were coming out.

She was Catholic and had all kinds of weird ideas about masturbation, too.  It was ok for guys but it ruined women.  Fingers were not allowed to touch a vagina or else it was sinful, including wiping and periods and bathing.  Women made loud noises during masturbating and she was going to tell on anyone who she heard.  You had to lay down completely naked(both guys and girls) to masturbate, so she was careful to never lay down naked.

Probably other things, but I cannot remember them."
"A girl I used to work with came from a really strict family. Her FIANCÉ had to ask her PARENTS for permission any time he wanted to take her on a date, and she didn’t think this was the least bit unusual. Her fiancé. Guys. "
"I studied abroad in France for a semester and met a girl from Saudi Arabia. I was there on student loans, had worked three jobs the summer before so I would have spending money, and was very, very careful about how I spent my money. I used my money for food and travel. That's it. No shopping or buying things unless absolutely necessary.
She could not understand why I declined going out to lunch every day and didn't buy anything when I accompanied her shopping or opted to go to bars with no covers as opposed to clubs with €20 covers. 

THE WORST thing though, was her and I and a group of friends took a long walk through the city to a park, probably 3 miles or so. Her shoes were hurting her. So she went to the first shoe store she saw, bought a pair of €200 shoes and tossed her other ones in the trash. We walked home. She then proceeded TO TOSS THE BRAND NEW SHOES SHE HAD JUST BOUGHT INTO THE TRASH on her way up to her apartment. My jaw was on the floor. I was going to fish the shoes out of the garbage, but due to the design of the bin, it wasn't possible.
I was running out of money at that point and thought my head was going to fucking explode. "
"Not words, but he like... Made a moose call... So guttural that the veins in his neck were popping out. 

""Hun... What are you doing?""

""I'm telling the deer to get out of the way.""

""Okay :)  We're in the bedroom, though.""

""... I know"" 

It was one of those things that made us burst into laughter throughout the day and then some."
"A friend of mine moved in with her husband (who has come a LONG way). Her husband is an only child and the apple of his mothers eye. She told him that only women were allowed in the kitchen unless it was snack time. He moved in with my friend (then fiancé) and tried to ""help"" her with the groceries. He bought the groceries, and then he put everything, including the ice cream, milk and raw meat in the pantry. 
His first attempt and he was confused about where the stuff was supposed to go.
EDIT— hey guys- I didn’t believe this shit either, but my friend did not mind updating this guy on what fridges and shit are for- been together 6 years and married 5, 2 kids later and he’s a BA dad who puts milk in the fridge. "
"I knew a guy like that.  He had no idea that inviting us poor people to a fancy 100+ dollar per plate restaurant was something we would have to plan for.  He was legitimately confused when we could not show up at ""his favorite restaurant""."
"He was trying to be “edgy” by telling me a “funny” joke he told his (female) CEO in front of all his male coworkers.

&gt;Him: Hey Jill, wanna hear a joke?

&gt;Her: Uh, sure.

&gt;Him: Women’s rights.


Neither she nor I found that funny. He did get written up for it, though.
"
"This happened last night.  

After a grueling 14 hour shift I finally come home around 11pm to find someone else had parked in my spot. 

At first I was livid and immediately wanted to call the towing company. But then I thought: ""How shitty would it be for them to wake up on MONDAY with no car? Mondays are bad enough as it is...""

So I called my friend instead, asked if I could spend the night at his place, get the go ahead, and 40 minutes later I'm tucked in bed. 

Wake up to my car missing. Apparently it was street cleaning day and I couldn't see the sign because it was midnight. 

*I* got towed. "
"Oh mine is a wealth of sleepy wonder! He once rolled over and woke me up to ask, ""Have you ever really thought about length? Why is 15 more than 30??"". Another night, shortly after watching The Last Jedi, he promised me, ""You can borrow the light saber, sure, but you HAVE to give it back."" Most recently, as I was leaving for work early, I woke him up to give him a kiss and mentioned that he was all wrapped up. He told me with the sincerity and earnest of a man who truly believed it that ""When I wake up, I'll be a beautiful butterfly!!"" I love that weirdo."
"My tumblr is high key private and I never post about where I’m from, personal info or even my actual name on there and I never gave it to anyone I knew personally....there was some random that would continuously send me messages that were obsessive for well over a year that I typically brushed off...anyways on my birthday last year I came home from work and found a huge bouquet of flowers from him...oh and he doesn’t even live in the same city as me apparently.

That scared the ever living fuck out of me. 
I deleted that tumblr account. "
"Lots of truth.  I once tried to explain to a guy (white, in his mid-twenties) what the phrase meant, and in return I got a long lecture about the ego, and how a knock to self-esteem *is* a sort of death. He told me that, to men, humiliation *feels* worth than death, and so fearing being laughed at is *to men* even worse than fearing murder is to women.

I could not even get him to agree with me that, objectively, being murdered is worse than being laughed at. He called me insensitive to men’s pain."
"Not being very affectionate, including verbally affectionate. Words of affirmation mean a lot to me. "
"I went to a Catholic university for a while. A girl on my floor heard that I had a boyfriend so she asked me if I’d kissed him. I said yes and she said “Oh so you’re not a virgin anymore”

I had to explain to her that I wasn’t but it wasn’t because of kissing "
I need a lot of reassurance that someone loves me. It's infuriating because I want to just be capable of loving myself enough. 
"About 6 years ago, my now\-husband and I had been dating for about a year or so. He called me one day to ask me why ""I"" had a profile on the website PlentyOfFish, which his roommate had found. Thank goodness, he didn't believe it was really me. The photos had been jacked from my FB profile \(which I keep pretty tight\-knit\) but the person had used my real name and age and other details about me. Someone was actively pretending to be me. 

The profile was vulgar\- saying how I liked it rough and how I just LOVED the thought of being a curious woman's first time, etc.

I thought it was one of my bf's exes. Vindictive, wanted us to break\-up. Something like that. But it wasn't.

Living in actual fear, I felt like my hands were tied. I called the police to ask what my options were and he explained to me that it sounded like it was someone VERY close to me. He said that if they look into this, they're not going to waste their time unless I was going to press charges. So, I had to think long and hard if this is what I wanted to do. He said the best idea would be to try and bait them out and find out who it was and then make a decision.

My coworker created a fake profile and started to talk to ""me"". ""I"" wrote back immediately. I was flirty, devilish, eager to please. She asked me if I had anymore photos and I said I could send more when I got home. My friend saw one of my photos and my arm was exposed\- you could see a tattoo on it. It's a list in Punjabi. My friend asked me what my tattoo was\-\- and that's where ""I"" blew it. The fake me said that it was a list of my family members. And then I mentioned my nephews and their ages.

And that's when I sunk. I knew who it was.

I called my sister. I was gutted. I told her that whoever it was knew HER and not just me. And someone who knew us well\- my own boyfriend doesn't know my nephew's ages, let alone their birthdays \(my sister and her kids live 4\+ hours away and he'd only met them 2\-3 times by that point\). I asked her if anyone close to her could have done this to me? She was insulted. I couldn't blame her.

I wrote on my FB that I knew someone out there, one of my ""friends"" had done this to me. I let them know that I've called the police and would be pressing charges UNLESS that person confessed to me privately.

The next day I got a phone call.

It was my sister's fiance. My future brother\-in\-law. It was him. He had done this to me.

My sister didn't know yet. I hung up the phone after screaming at him and called her immediately. We both couldn't stop apologizing to each other. She didn't know. She couldn't have believed it. She told me he had just left to take his computer to the shop because it had ""a virus"" \-\- he was trying to wipe it clean. While on the phone with me, she saw him pull in the driveway. I asked her if she wanted me to stay on the phone, but she said no. I called my boyfriend and told him I was going home. Seconds later, she called me back. She said he wanted to apologize to me, but then he was leaving. I said I didn't want to talk to him and I heard her turn to him and say, ""She doesn't want to f\*\*\*\*\*\* talk to you."" Then she hung up. I never saw him again.

A family was destroyed that day. I didn't take it any further because I could never have lived with myself if those boys knew about this. He wasn't a threat to them. And I still never understood his threat to me.

He was obsessed with me\- but my sister and I could never figure out why. Why not just use my photos\- why use my whole life? He put me in danger. What if someone saw me on the street and recognized me from ""our"" interactions? Did he want me? Did he want to be me? I'll never know. 

I lost trust in everyone. I was broken. My sister and I fell into each other and it took us a LONG time to move forward. She's much happier now, but he's now remarried with another child and it kills me that he got the happy ending first. They kept it quiet because it was so embarrassing \(for both of them\). But he just got to move on like nothing ever happened and she and I were left to pick up all of the pieces.

I'll never forgive him. And hatred is so poisonous. It gets a little better every day."
"I knew a young woman in her freshman year of college... This girl set up her dorm room like an eight year old's bedroom, with unicorn pictures and fairy stuff and the like. Very quiet, had to be drawn out. What we found out when we did draw her out was that her mother was terminally ill. She was being raised in part by her grandmother, because they knew her mom didn't have much longer. Here's the thing: *She didn't know what her mother was dying of.* They wouldn't tell her because she was ""too young to be allowed to know."" "

"A friend I used to party with in college tried breaking up with her boyfriend who stalked her for months and then shot her dead on her front porch. He was upset that she reported his stalking to the school, who didn't do anything about it and now she's gone. So yeah, in my personal experience, I totally agree with this statement. "
"I had a deformed cinnamon gummy bear,  it was smaller and skinny and weird looking, I felt bad for it, lol, so I ate it.....damn thing had about 1000 times more cinnamon than the rest and burned the crap out of my mouth.

Talk about our future together. He wondered if I’d leave my job to take care of our children.
"Celestial is my favorite word ever. It has a pretty sound, meaning and look."
Had a guy who thought it would be a ‘good’ idea to give me a present. That present was a tiny black g-string that he genuinely then asked for me to try on.
"I was at the park practicing tennis (I was trying to find a hobby after college) and volleying the ball against a giant plywood board. I was doing my own thing, minding my own business when I felt someone watching me. Some middle aged dude got into the practice court without my noticing! This was before my “give no fucks” life philosophy so I smiled politely and tried to ignore him. 

Apparently that caused him to launch into a bunch of questions about how long I’ve been playing and he noticed me from the top of the hill etc. At that point I stopped playing and was trying to get back to my bag and water bottle by the gate but he was blocking my way. I felt trapped and knew this was not good. Out of the corner of my eye I saw two guys walking to another court and made eye contact with one of the guys and tried to give him a “look this way”. He saw me stalling and the creeper getting closer so he yelled out “holy shit is that Becca?? Becca are you back for the summer?!” Creeper slunk away and I bolted for the gate. The guys were nice and asked if I wanted to play with them but I was shaken so they walked me back to my car. I never caught their names but thank god they were there."
"I was outside with my dog. A circa seven year old girl came along and started playing with my dog. She then called her by her name and when I asked her why she knew her name she casually responded with ""she told me"". "
"My husband sat straight upright one night and told me ""I can't breathe - my wedding dress is too tight"".  No idea where that came from, but he has never lived it down!"
"I live overseas and my mother was really upset when I moved. When I got married a few years ago, we paid for my parents to stay in a really, REALLY nice hotel, so they'd enjoy their trip. My mother decided she hated the hotel, complained about it constantly but also refused to leave her room for 90% of the trip and even sent my dad out for sandwiches every night so she didn't need to leave to eat. She also refused to have her wedding hair and make-up done with me, because she didn't want to leave the hotel until she absolutely HAD to. 

Then they were late to my wedding...and my mother spent the recpetion, grousing and moaning about the food. 

We spent over $5000 on them to make them happy, and all I got was an earful on how much they hated everything about the whole trip.  Never again.

"I've gotta say it's when I hear people say ""If you don't like your job why don't you just go find another one?"" as if it's sage advice."
"Assuming you mean a first date, I just want a natural, free-flowing conversation.  

It's not a job interview, and it's not an examination of the Portfolio of my Beliefs."
"I had a mormon friend in high school, and while I was sheltered myself, she considered me a wild kid.

We were both *really* into Harry Potter.  When Goblet of Fire came out I read it within a day, but she had to sit and read it with her family.  One day she comes up and asks me ""what happened at the end?""  I asked why, I thought she had read it. Turns out her dad thought the ending was too graphic, and just told them Voldemort was back.  We were 15 when the book came out.

Another time she asked me for relationship advice. Her concern: she liked making out with her boyfriend. I told her that was normal.  She got very serious and said, ""no, Sn0tface, I *really* like making out with him."""

"Forced his hands down my pants just because I let him kiss me. He was about 250 lb of muscle. I was about 21 and scared shitless and the harder I tried to move the more difficult it became to get away from him.

"I invited him over for dinner to meet my housemates. He asked me if there was anything he could bring so I said he could bring the pudding. I knew this would make him popular with my friends and thought it an appropriate gesture seeing as I was cooking for everyone. Well much to our disappointment he turned up without any pudding and his excuse was that ‘he couldn’t decide on what to get so he got nothing’ - wasn’t even sorry. 

I need a man who can make decisions. Especially when it comes to pudding. If in doubt - bring ice cream. Turned out to be a real deal breaker both for me *and* my housemates. 

Disclaimer: pudding is what us brits call dessert"
"Mine was a guy that I'd known for years, and agreed to go for a date at his house where we were going to eat pasta and watch a film (like I said, known him for years and had been to his house in non-date contexts so wasn't worried or anything).

Turns out that while we'd been friends for ages, he'd actually been ""waiting for his chance"" with me, so he had far, faaar higher expectations for this date than I did. For me, it was two old friends who were both single and attracted to each other wanting to see if sparks would fly. For him, it was The Night he'd been waiting for.

So I get to his house, and he'd transformed his living room with blankets, fairy lights everywhere, candles, incence burning and petals going up the stairs (I didn't see the bedroom but I can only imagine). The sort of thing that would be amazing for your first anniversary, but seeing as we'd agreed to a quiet night in to keep things casual and not incite gossip, was so over the top I didn't know what to say. I was quietly mortified and it must have shown on my face because he started apologising.

We ate pasta, watched a film about chavs saving an apartment block from an alien attack (I think that was the film), and I felt super awkward the entire time, realising that we weren't reading the same book, let alone on the same page. I tried to act natural, but any touching no longer felt casual and easy, it felt staged and there was this huge weight of expectation.

Conversation was stilted and awkward (which it never had been before), and I left not long after the film. He seemed crushed and I felt awful, and we never spoke of it again."
"I’ve told this story on Reddit before but it still stings so here goes:

I was like, 18 or 19 and a guy I know tells me his father has been laid off his long haul trucking job and they’re struggling for money because his mum is a full time carer for his autistic brother. We’ve been friends for a few years at this point so I know how badly this will hit them so I take out £200 from my student loan (I don’t know about in the US but in the UK we get maintenance grants to live on as well) and send it to them. I ate beans on toast for a couple of months because it set me back quite a bit and they go and buy a Playstation."
"Went to high school in a very Mormon area, my best friend was Mormon and thought she might be pregnant because her period was late and her and her boyfriend had been making out and he got a boner.

"In college, my brother was saying how ""lucky"" it was that he didn't know any women that were sexually assaulted.

In the room, there were 10 women, including his three sisters.  Seven of us that I know of had been sexually assaulted at some point by their early 20s."
He made a joke about putting a roofie in my drink when I went to the restroom.
"I'm c/p from something I posted on /r/letsnotmeet a few years ago:

I worked at a riding stable from 15-19. I picked up a lot of jobs housesitting while working at the barn, the families were all very nice and it paid well.

This past November I was staying at one the family's houses and watching their lab, Maggie, while they were on vacation. They lived in a really nice neighborhood on the outskirts of old town. The house was on the far end of the neighborhood and thick trees flanked the back yard, and a dirt road ran behind the trees. I had accidently went down the road the first time I tried to find the house and there wasn't much down there an abbandoned house with lots of deer in the front yard. and a small ranch house that had retained it's spot even though mini-mansions had sprung up around it.

The first night everything went great. Second night? not so much.

I had a weird feeling for a few hours before I went to bed, but wrote it off as spending too much time on /r/nosleep and /r/creepy. I made sure all the doors were locked, blinds were closed, and I went to bed just after midnight, still feeling uneasy. Maggie usually sleeps with me but that night she just followed me up the stairs and to the bedroom and then sulked back downstairs.

At 2:26AM Maggie woke me up by standing next to the bed and whining. I had just let her out before I went to bed so I was pretty sure didn't have to go out to use the bathroom. I rolled back over and hoped she would stop but she didn't. I gave in soon enough and as I climbed out of bed I realized the house was freezing cold. I followed Maggie downstairs to the kitchen. The door to the backyard was wide open. The doors that go into their house are weird, you can't open any of the doors (from the inside or outside) without a key. Not to mention this was a heavy door, not the kind that just gets blown open by the wind.

The only thing that eased my mind was that Maggie's didn't seem ready to kill an intruder and she'll usually at least bark at you. So I did a quick look around (I was to scared to do anything more), nothing seemed out of place. The owners often left credit and debit cards as well as wads of cash laying on the counters and it was all there - if anyone was going to steal something it was right next to the door and easy pickings but since nothing was missing I tried to brush it off as forgetting to lock the door and the wind. I made sure to lock it this time and went back to bed.

Maggie still didn't want to sleep with me and went back downstairs. Less than an hour later, she woke me up again. This time I didn't question her. I crept back down stairs more cautiously than I had before. The backdoor was open again, this time the key I had sitting on the kitchen island was in the lock.

Someone had been in the house with me.

Police were called, they looked around the house and found no one. Everything of value was still in it's place so I really worry about the intentions of whoever broke in...

The family was shocked that something like that had happened and have since moved to a large farm 20 minutes away that has video surveillance up."

"On a smaller scale, I think this happens to most people. Lifestyle creep and hedonistic treadmill and all that. I was an intern at work, at a law firm with a partner who had more money than god, and the boss would ask if I could pick up some supplies, to be reimbursed later. I was too embarrassed to mention that I didn't have $10 in cash, so I just overdrew my account, and paid for it for like 2 weeks after. I don't think it would ever cross his mind that a college kid doesn't have money till payday. I notice myself thinking that way with my younger cousins now, too, but almost always catch it. \(I think and hope\)"

As i started to walk away he got in front of me blocking my path and I shit you not an unmarked white van pulled up behind me and the door opened revealing another really creepy mid 30s man. I could tell I was in a run-for-your-life moment. I couldn't scream even though I wanted to and just as the other man got out of the van and the other guy was closing in, my grandma shows up screaming ""what the fuck do you creeps think youre doing?!"" They scatter... we make a police report. I go home safe and sound, only slightly traumatized.

"Bad sex for a man is that it's ""boring"" and the woman was a ""starfish"" 

Bad sex for a woman involves bleeding and tearing.

When a man has sex for the first time, he is so excited because he knows it's gonna feel so damn good and he's basically guaranteed an orgasm. 

When a woman first has sex, she knows it's going to be uncomfortable at best, painful and bloody at worst, and she is pretty much guaranteed not to orgasm. "
"I had an 8th grade student who once accidentally said “testicles” instead of “tentacles” during a class presentation. When the room—filled with 13 and 14 year olds!—began laughing uncontrollably, this sweet baby angel looks at the class with the biggest eyes and starts saying, “Why are you guys laughing at me? I’m talking about the testicles on the octopuses. You all know what I’m talking about!” It ended with the girl in tears and me having to explain male genitalia to her in the hallway. "

"Picky eaters.

I get that people don't like certain things and/or have allergies and I am willing to accommodate those things, but I want to be able to explore places, try new things etc. with both friends and romantic partners. If I spent an extra hour of time wandering around to different places because you refuse to eat anything that isn't potatoes....were gonna have a bad time.

It's not even the annoyance of finding places to eat, it's also the absolute refusal to try new things/foods. "
"She didn't know what a pap smear was, then when she was told what a pap smear was, she asked what a gynecologist is.

Her parents are super strict and sheltering religious fanatical types &amp; she's ~19. Vaginas are dirty sin factories that nobody should think about."
"My sister is one of those people who gets jealous of other people's lives but refuses to improve her own. She's part of a religious group/cult and uses her faith as an excuse to not work despite her family barely being able to afford the essentials.

My mom and I have helped her, her husband, and her three kids over the years both financially and physically by constantly watching her kids because she couldn't handle them. I helped her pay rent, bought her a laptop when hers died, and bought bikes for the kids so they'd have something to do other than be home schooled by my highschool drop-out sister who mostly made them learn on their own anyway.

Then I married an atheist. My sister and her husband have cut all ties with me and my parents (since they supported the marriage), they've never met my husband, and they refuse to let me see my youngest nephew for fear we'll contaminate his mind.

I'm pretty sure religion is just an excuse though. She's always been jealous of my life because I work and can therefore afford things like vacations. In her words, ""it must be nice to go on vacation while the people who really deserve one can't afford it."" Meanwhile, she's posting prayers to religious Facebook groups all day while other people watch her kids."

"While I did do the whole dress/party, I want to address your ""The whole ""feel like a princess for one day"" and ""the best day in a woman's life"" and all that jazz"" comment. If you're only doing it to feel like a princess, and legitimately believe that that will be the best day in your life, you're doing it for the wrong reasons IMO. We had a huge party because we love throwing parties and hanging out with large groups of friends. It was not the best day of my life; that would be selling the rest of my life short. But that's the great thing about weddings...they are YOURS and you get to do whatever you want with them. Small one, big one, eloping... at the end of the day it's you and the person you love and that's all that matters."
"Nothing in particular, just something that shows he’s taking an active interest in me. I’m a very good conversationalist and I can understand that not everyone is, but it’s so painful when I have to pull everything out of the other person.

Also, try and keep the quoting of shows and movies you like to a minimum. I went in a date with a guy who spoke almost exclusively in archer quotes and it was extremely tedious and annoying. "
"I legit had this girl I went on a date ask me ""What do you consider to be your greatest strength and greatest weakness?""

And 16 year old me froze the fuck up, not sure how to answer it and also not sure if the question meant the date was going well.

The date did not end up going well, and we drifted apart. But like 8 years later I bumped into the same girl and brought up the question (thinking she'd be like ""Oh yeah, that was my bad"" or something), and she goes on to tell me that she asked *every* date she ever had that question. I mean, I guess, whatever works, right?

She was married, and the best part? Her husband's answer on their first date to his greatest strength and greatest weakness? ""You and you."""
"Not creepy in the same way that the rest of the stories here are, but definitely scares the hell out of me.

So my friend A has a blue bag, and has always had a blue bag. I’ve known her for years, and every day she carries this blue bag around. I know it’s blue, and i know the exact shade of blue it is.

In fact, I literally zipped it for her the other day, and the zipper was halfway broken, which led to her saying that she’s been thinking of getting a new pink bag, and i make a comment about how she’s becoming me because almost everything I own is pink.

Well, a few days back she walked into class with a pink bag, with no broken zipper, but in the exact same style as that blue bag. This bag is rather unique, so it’s odd that she would replace the bag with something exactly the same but different coloured, so I ask about it.

Turns out, the bag has never been blue, and the zipper was never broken, and my friend has no recollection of the conversation occurring. The conversation happened the day before. But I know the bag was blue, I know the zipper was broken and I know for a fact I wasn’t dreaming or hallucinating.

I’m still trying to wrap my head around it."
"The person I am currently seeing has done a lot of these things... 

The toilet in our house was clogged and he asked what the thing next to it was and if it was a plunger. The thing next to it was a toilet brush. Which he promptly asked what it was for... Cleaning the toilet. Which made him even more surprised because he thought toilets were ""self cleaning.""

This is also among with other things like not knowing how to vacuum or do laundry. He didn't even know his family was rich... I had to tell him that living in a mansion is not the norm, he thought he house was small because everyone he knows is even more rich than him..."
Did... Did you laugh at him...?

"Made a joke about getting a ruler tattooed on his penis, with the implication that it wouldn't be to scale but nobody would know the difference anyway. (this was our only date; way later he messaged me asking for a critique of the cringiest first message he wanted to send to some other poor lady. I did not respond. It was some role playing thing about an alien abduction or something?)

For a second date, different dude had been complaining about wrist pain for the whole date. At the end of it, he finally tells me it's from trying to learn how to use a whip at a BDSM club. While he's driving me back to my car from the date, he offers to tie me up before I go home. Collectively I have spent maybe 6 hours with this person.

I'm sure there's more but thankfully it's been a while since I've been dating new people!"

"My mom's friend sheltered her kids awfully while they were growing up, to the point that the Harry Potter movies scared them \(I guess they could be scary for 6 year olds, but they were 15\), they didn't know who Elvis was, they didn't know what cocaine was, things like that. The youngest one just graduated college this weekend, but for her last year there, she became an RA. She met with all the other RAs, and developed a crush on one of them. A nice looking guy, I'm sure a nice guy in general, and, he was black. Normally, that doesn't matter, but with this story, it does.

See, the kids were so sheltered, that they didn't really grow up around anyone that wasn't well off and white. Their mom is slightly racist, where you can tell that she definitely holds prejudices, \(she'll literally go out of her way to take the highway to our house, which adds about 15 more minutes, instead of just going through the city, because, *gasp*, it's a predominantly black neighbor\), but she's not a member of the KKK or anything. Their dad isn't at all, and the kids aren't, either \(though the kids have subconscious prejudices\). They just literally have never been around people who weren't white, essentially.

Anyway, she was telling my friends and I about this guy she really liked, and my friend asked her about it. She said, and I quote, ""well, he's really funny, and nice, for a black guy!"" All of my friends and I just kind of stopped and looked at each other, and another friend goes, ""w...what? For a black guy?"" The girl in question then just said, ""yeah! He's really nice!"" completely oblivious as to why what she said was wrong.

Yes, it's racist, but honest to god, these girls are so sheltered, that it's literally them not even *being* racist. They literally just *did not know* that black people can be nice, funny, good looking, etc. They've said some REALLY off the wall things, but that was the one that really made me question a lot."
"I was looking for outside signs that it was ok to end the relationship. Nothing was wrong, he was a really great guy, just not for me. I tried to convince myself that it’s okay to end things, tried to find a more “real” reason instead of just realizing that sometimes nothing has to be really WRONG. "
"I was in college and went to visit my parents for the weekend. I stopped by their store in town, stuck around for a bit, then headed out to their house. They live out in the country and there is only one road connecting that town to the next, so it is not uncommon for someone to be behind you the entire way.  I never knew the guy was following me. Down my parents' road, this older model car starts flashing its lights. I kept driving and he kept flashing, and I ended up pulling into my parents' driveway and stopping, just giving him enough room to pull in behind me. It may have been a friend, someone telling me I had a broken taillight, I don't know.

Out stepped this stubby, greasy\-looking middle\-aged man. He stood several feet away from my window and spoke in a very firm, authoritarian voice: ""I see you're not from around here."" It had that almost condescending tinge to it. Women are easily intimidated, right! I had one hand on the wheel, and the other at my waistband. I think I had just received my handgun carry permit, and at the time I would have been carrying either a Glock 23 or a Kahr K40. My alarms went off in my head.

I think I said *I've lived there for 10 years,* firmly with a deadpan face.

The *Authoritarian Intimidation* tactic did not work, and it was absolutely amazing how suddenly he transitioned into the *Sympathy, Help Me* tactic. Women are prone to be helpers by nature, right! His voice smoothed and his body relaxed, he turned kinda fidgety and then he tried, ""Well I figured you were from out of town and didn't know the place. I saw you back in town. I was looking for a campground and was hoping you could help me find one. You know of any campgrounds around here?""

All I could see was:

1. This guy saw me back in town
2. Saw I was a young female traveling alone
3. Most likely noted I had out of town plates and might not be ""missed""
4. Followed me out of town and up this country road
5. Tried to intimidate me with a cop\-like authoritarian voice and stance
6. Immediately switched tactics when it did not work
7. Thinks I'm not local but somehow able to ""help"" him find a specific local area
8. probably has Hefty bags, duct tape, and a shovel in his trunk.

I think I told him he'd have to go to the next town, my face never straying from a serious deadpan.

""Oh, okay."" The greasy little man fidgeted. ""Would like to go with me to find a campground?""

""NO.""

He fidgeted around and then finally got back in his car and left. I finished my way up the driveway. I remember my mind whirling, and an adrenaline dump maybe half an hour after that. I probably should've called the police and reported him as a suspicious person."
"First Date: Took me out to eat wearing smelly toothpaste-stained clothes. Left a 5% tip (I'm a former server) and asked me to come back to his house so his parents could meet me. I declined. (Blamed it on my train schedule). He said his parents will drive me home. Um nope! 
I should also add we were both in our 30s and the following week he surprised me at my retail job with his uncle, and introduced me as his girlfriend."

"This happened quite some time ago but I once went out with someone who probably wasn't even human, as he was entirely composed of red flags. We met at a sports bar type place with the intention of having dinner then going to see a movie. Some of the highlights were:

-an unending series of rape jokes and roofie jokes. Plus, every time I got a new drink (even though I wasn't old enough to order alcohol so it was Diet Coke) he'd be like, ah yea, I love it when my dates keep drinking. -__- hurhur, funny guy, that's right, in space nobody can hear you scream. Yes, if you're doing a woman in a forest and nobody is around to hear you, No still means No.

-bragging about some sort of 'sex dungeon' he had in his garage, even though later he let slip that he had moved back in with his parents months ago. STFU Jimothy, your mom isn't going to let you hang a sex swing next to her washing machine.

-he did take a break from rape jokes to make incredibly racist one liners, then got all pucker-faced when I didn't find them funny

-not letting me pay for my share of the bill, which would have been sweet if it wasn't immediately followed up with ""now you're guaranteed to put out""

This was all during the course of one meal, which I couldn't even finish because when I'm around garbage people I lose my appetite. So I did what any polite, well-mannered (ie: pushover) girl does: send a sneaky text to my friend and request an emergency call. Unfortunately I sent it as a group text to about five friends so within minutes, my phone started B L O W I N G  U P.

He wasn't as bad as I thought he'd be about having to leave early. I think it's because of the sheer amount of calls I was receiving. So I gtfo'd and dodged his texts and calls for a week til he got the message. And I never let a coworker set me up with their friends again :D"
"I was telling my high school boyfriend years ago how I was frustrated that I couldn’t get a car when I’d just gotten my license. His response was, “why not? All you need is $10K-$15K to get a decent used car.” I then explained to him that not everyone just has that money to take out of the budget for anything, much less a car for a 17 year old. He kept telling me ALL you need is $10K!!! Ok. "
"My roommate didn't understand that regular apartments and homes do not have maid service.  
He seemed bewildered the first time we returned to his mess in our place, and I thought he was being funny since he made it a funny rant about lazy maids.  
I cleaned up before I left while he was at work.  
The next time it happened he asked me which maid service was contracted through the HOA, because they weren't doing their job.   
He was dead serious.

"Tell me a rapid series fire of extremely personal info and then say ""I just thought you should know in case we're ever in a serious relationship."" It was an internet date and we'd never met before that, and it was like a ten minute monologue. I sped through my drink and the entire date was about 20 minutes long."
"Single but met someone recently. It’s the way he looks at me. His face lights up every time our eyes meet. That and he moves in close when we talk and then shies away only to come right back. It’s like some kind of gravitational pull. It’s cute and a little awkward. Yet, the man is sexy as hell and has charisma in spades. After seventeen years of being ignored sexually in a bad marriage, it feels good to be wanted. He doesn’t have to say it, it’s written all over his face. It may never be more than flirting but it makes me feel sexier than I’ve felt in a very long time."

"A few years ago when that song “I Took A Pill in Ibiza” was super popular my fiancé started singing it in his sleep and I was laughing so hard it woke him up and I told him about it and he claims that he had heard the song obviously on the radio but didn’t know it well enough to sing the correct words. Still cracks me up bc he really didn’t know the words so it’s hilarious that he sang it in his sleep. Lol and another time he rolled over and grabbed my ass and said “you got the biggest booty in town, the best booty around” "
"Just in case this is slightly confusing for those of you in North America, OP doesn't really, really, *really* love pudding cups. In the UK, pudding also means dessert. "
"That this isn't a dress rehearsal.  I spent my twenties too terrified to make a decision or choose a career path because I was terrified I'd regret it.  I always had in the back of my mind that somehow I have more time and could always choose a path later.   As if the real life timeline hadn't started and I was just practicing.  Well, I'm 30 now and I've started to come to terms with the fact that you get one life.  That's it.  If I keep waiting to make big decisions \(job/mate/city/etc\) then I'm going to waste my life terrified.  I have a lot of generalized anxiety, so I think this is part of it.  If anyone else read The Bell Jar, I obviously connected hard with the Fig tree metaphor.  "
"You know, I was a shy naive girl once. I was really sheltered, I grew up in a rural area, my parents always treated me well, even my little brother was a great kid. But I never had much experience with men until college. 

I always believed people deserved the benefit of the doubt. However, as a naive girl, I did not understand that some people honestly do not have respect for you simply because of what you are. I’ve always felt the difference, but could never put the experiences into words. I ended up being manipulated in an emotionally abusive relationship that totally changed my world view. I still believe most people don’t mean any harm, but women have to be taught that there are predators out there. 

Every time I’m on Reddit, and see comments riddled with misogyny and shallow thinking, it really just reminds me that these people are still out there. After the Me Too movement, I realized all my favorite actresses all had to go through things that all women will have to face at some point in their lives. 

I think because of this unacknowledged burden, that we women all know to be true, it makes us stronger, wiser, and more compassionate people, because we know what it’s like to live in fear. I will always stick up for women. And I will always try my best to help those I see suffering the same way I did. I hope through solidarity, we can build peace. "

"I swapped my broadband over to a different provider. For the following three weeks I had call after call from the man that had taken my call, telling me that my voice was beautiful and that he loved me. I made a complaint to the company (several actually) and the police, he was arrested (not only for this, he had done something else, they wouldn’t say what) and they found my name and address in his home with some other ladies details, and a plan of where he would visit first. I was third. 
Creepy as fuck. "

"My boyfriend fell asleep before me last night and while I was playing a video game I realized a roach \(palmetto bug\) had been on my sweater and I felt it crawl up my neck. I loudly freaked out and stripped bare, trying to find it, and when it ran out of my jacket a high speed chase with a shoe took place. He slept through all of this until I cornered it, smashed it with my shoe several times and said loudly, naked, with shoe in hand, ""TO COME HERE MEANS CERTAIN DEATH!."" to which he half woke up, squinted at me, and goes ""Sorry, should I leave?"""
"Copying from my reply to another thread:

One time a drunk guy followed me home. I was just walking one afternoon and he started talking to me, saying he was in love with me, and wouldn’t let go. 

I ended up walking into the first open door I saw, which ended up being a hospital, and he stood outside waiting for me to come out. I told the receptionist what was going on and she said that unfortunately there was nothing she could do. I thought I’d just sit and wait for him to leave, but he decided to come in after me instead. That’s when the movie scene happened: it was a revolving door, so I just jumped in and went out the other side at the same time. I was only a block away from home, so I ran the rest of the way, and never saw him again. 

#edit: PLEASE STOP BLAMING THE FUCKING RECEPTIONIST"
"In 10th grade, a very sheltered, shy, very religious boy asked the entire table what a blowjob was. Everyone kind of laughed like it was a joke, but he had such a look of confusion it dawned on us that he was serious. So a girl leaned over and whispered an explanation. His eyes bulged out as he screamed, “Why would a boy ever LET a girl do that to him!” "
"I tried dating a guy that I met a few times beforehand. We texted often for a while and seemed to have a lot in common. Our first official date he gives me a gift of some bath related things  - sugar scrub, loofah, bath bomb, pedicure things and I didn't think to much of it. Second date was a movie night at my place and out of nowhere he started sucking my toes and kissing my feet. I looked at him mortified and he said ""What did you not use the things I got for you? Those we're really for me, I have a huge foot fetish."" NO thank you, leave my house now. "
"I'm divorced and remarried. When I married the first time we simply went to the courthouse and got married by a judge. No guests, no dress, no party. I never regretted it and we were married for 10 years. However, when I remarried I did have a small backyard wedding and I have to say that I'm really glad that I did. It was such a warm and loving day surrounded by our closest friends and family members and we love having the memories and photos to look back on.  It was a casual wedding, a good compromise between nothing at all and a princess dress church wedding.  I think it succeeded in being intimate and truthful to who we were.

Overall, I didn't regret either way that I did things, and believe that it's a personal choice and wouldn't judge anyone for either, but I'm glad that I had a wedding."

"I hate being openly communicative. For me it's much easier to just clam up when things upset me and then let them fester. I'm working on it! But yeah, feel bad for the dudes who put up with me."
"A simile thing happened to me when I was 14/15.  I was on the bus home having gone into town after school. I was literally in my school uniform. This creepy guy kept staring at me on the bus and licking his lips. When I got up to leave he followed me off the bus. I started walking down the street and I could hear him call after me “hey baby, where you goin’?”. I started walking faster and I could hear him still following me “baby girl, what’s wrong I just want to talk?”. At that point I start running and I can hear him running after me   “BITCH! Why you gotta be like this?”.

At that point I almost ran into this bouncer from a bar near my parents house, who had stepped onto the street to see what the noise was about. I half yelled at him that I didn’t know who the fuck this guy was and that I was only a kid. Luckily the bouncer believed me and ushered me into the outside seating area of the bar and told the creepy guy to GTFO before he called the cops. He then got someone else to watch the door as he took me home. I felt like an idiot having to be walked home, but he was still such a hero.

Praise for tough, scary looking bouncers."

"When I was in elementary school I really loved reading so I'd ask my mom to take my to the library quite often. There was one time I saw this man in the children's section, maybe in his 40s looking sweaty and flushed with his hand in his pocket that was moving around quite furiously... I'm sure you guys probably figured out what he was doing.

Unfortunately at that age I had no idea what he was doing and kinda followed him between the aisle of books, he noticed and tried to avoid me. I don't remember what happened after that but he was gone and I never saw him again."
"My mother was born in Italy so I grew up hearing her curse in Italian. My favorite, of course, is vaffanculo (go fuck yourself) and I’m also a fan of figlio di puttana (son of a bitch/whore).

"My boyfriend is a logger, so he's perpetually exhausted. He gets up around 2:30 every day, so he falls asleep at the drop of a hat or he ends up getting delirious.

Here are some things he's said to me:
""Stop it!"" What? ""Stop doing that!"" Doing what? ""Putting your butt in my face!""

""You know, you're just being opportunistic.""

""Oh my god did you see that lady just poop in the middle of the street?!""

There are so so many and I'm mad I can't think of the really good ones :(

Edit: one day he had a fever.... He was all wrapped up in his blanket like he had been tossing and turning. He starts going, ""help! I'm stuck! Help!"" And I'm feeling bad and trying to help because he seems genuinely scared, and then he goes, ""I'm stuck in 1985!"""

"Holy crap. I’m not sure my story is as drastic as all of yours but I’ll add it to the pile anyway. 

A college friend. Her parents were both rich attorneys, divorced, and she was the single child from their union. She had very little concept of money.

One day when we went shopping at a very famous department store in the same town we went to school in. We were still technically enrolled in school as college seniors, but she didn’t understand why I kept trying things on, admiring them, looking at the price tag, then putting them back. She settled on a high-end couture brand of shoes and proceeded to go through her wallet full of plastic.. and every one of her credit cards were maxed out because, and I quote, “dad must not have paid them yet.” [WTF!?]

So she’s forced to write a check!? She pulls out her checkbook..

And then turns to me and says.. 

“Can you teach me how to write a check?”

I was basically flabbergasted by the whole day.. I left the store with a lip balm, a tiny little luxury, and she left with a pair of shoes that at the time cost two months’ rent for me.. I just.. wow."

"Was driving home from work when I was younger in high school and it was about 2 AM. I stopped real quick to get fuel so I didn’t have to stop in the morning. Then a white car pulls up to the pump across from me while I was filling up the vehicle and this guy starts immediately power walking towards me.

He offers to pay for my gasoline in an odd tone and after I said no thank you he starts to slowly close in on my personal space. I had to firmly tell him to stop and get back. He lurched at me and I pulled the gas pump out my vehicle and sprayed him in the eyes with it. The gas attendant waved me off and yelled “go, get out of here!”.

I was sure that guy was going to kidnap me or something. I now always keep something for personal self-defense to this day whether it’s mace, a Glock 42/26 (I have a proper license to carry concealed issued by my state), a collapsible baton, etc. "
My boyfriend once said ‘that’s the BLUEST thing I’ve ever seen!’ of course he didn’t remember what he was dreaming about
"My boyfriend rolled over and said, ""Pew pew pew! Pew pew pew pew!"" I laughed so hard. "
i tend to always start an argument over the littlest things then i over exaggerate everything and start crying like a baby. i know that’s really annoying :(
"While I don’t think most women expect straight-up _murder_, there’s definitely a widespread concern for personal safety that most men simply don’t seem to have. I can’t say I know any straight guys who seem to worry about things like keeping an eye on their drink in a bar at all times, or their personal safety when they turn a woman down or when they have to tell a woman something unpleasant, or who make sure they have an exit plan and a friend ready to check up on them when they go on a date with a stranger, or... And while I definitely know men who’ve experienced unwanted sexual contact of some sort from a woman, I honestly can’t point to a single woman I know who’s never experienced such things, or for whom harassment from men hasn’t been an ongoing reality for a long time, usually starting in or before middle school. And that’s _definitely_ not just “the hot ones,” and not just women in a particular country or culture. 

So yeah, I don’t expect to get _murdered_. Most people don’t get murdered, although apparently [more than half of female homicide victims](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/21/538518569/cdc-half-of-all-female-murder-victims-are-killed-by-intimate-partners) (sample link) are killed by their intimate partners, and [96% of murderers are men](http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf) (PDF link). I do worry about, and try to control for, physical violence and transgressions from men in a way that men overwhelmingly don’t seem to from women. And from what I can tell, that’s fairly typical. "
"I've never met anyone who said, ""I wish I'd spent tens of thousands MORE on a big wedding"" for any reason."
"First off, the baby was wanted and planned for by us both. And even though I had wicked heartburn for months and had to sleep sitting up in an easy chair, I was never nauseated. I've never been so horny in my life, and staying on that low boil felt kinda nice, sexy and feminine. 


And it was fascinating. The changes in my body, the kicks and hiccups and movement, the understanding that my body could actually create a human was mind blowing. The anticipation was fun, as was knowing that of all the things which were about to change permanently in my life: this was my own process, all me. My last moment alone, my last solo project. 




I just felt *capable*. "
"The times I'm feeling generous and let people into traffic and then they proceed to drive like idiots. Such as that guy who drove about 10 feet and then STOPPED IN THE ROAD to talk to someone on the sidewalk, in busy rush hour traffic, and I was stuck behind him. "
"I once knew a pastor's daughter who, at the age of 25, didn't know anything about the mechanics of sex or even her own body. Didn't know that a clitoris existed, that the vagina produces any lubrication--stuff like that. She also still lived with her parents, who still grounded her for not keeping her room clean enough."
Just throw your engraved money clip to the side and run in the other direction. 
"He insulted my shoes,\(very cute wedges\) my hand bag \(coach\), and my hair \(long blonde\). Then he tried to go on another date with me, damn fool.  "
"He took me to a conservatory near my house. It was a giant glass dome. Very echo-ey.  As we were going to leave, he went to the bathroom.  The bathrooms on either side of this giant glass vestibule had their doors open and lots of people were filtering in and out. 

After he goes in, I start hearing these really loud echoing fart/diarrhea noises. Everyone in the vestibule is like looking at each other and keeping their heads down trying not to laugh. They are the loudest farts of all time. 

After 5 minutes of this, I'm totally convincing myself that it wasn't him, so I could look him in the eye and not be disgusted. I'm like it was probably any of the other 15 people that went in and out. 

Then he comes up to me and says, ""yeah, that was me."" And I couldn't even look at him so I pretended like I had no idea what he was talking about. 

TLDR: he filled an echo chamber with fart noises and boldly told me that yeah, it was him. 

"
"When my husband and I were getting married, the vicar gave us ""lessons"" and ""homework."" One of the things we were asked to do as part of our preparations for the wedding, was to write letters to each other, in which we explained why we loved each other. It was my favourite thing. I wrote mine at once, and gave it to my husband. He took forever with his, until I thought he had forgotten. This was annoying and disappointing, tbh, since I thought it was a nice exercise and one of the few worthwhile things that happened as a result of these ""lessons"". Finally, when I had decided to let the matter go, and forgot about it entirely, my husband handed me a 30 page treaties, hand \-written, about why he loved me. It took him so long, he explained, because he wanted to get it just right.  "
"I went to Catholic school and may be able to answer. One of my teachers, to scare us into not even thinking about having sex, told us that if sperm even got semi-near the vagina, (like between the legs, the butt etc) that a woman could (and therefore would) get pregnant. 

If we had not had biology in high school that was very explicit in regards to human reproduction, I can see how some of my classmates could have walked away with similar beliefs. "
Sounds like you need to hang out with new guys. I have lots of guy friends and am a man myself and we don't talk about women like that.
"&gt; Then he asked if he could masturbate to the thought of me at least.

that is literally the most pathetic follow up to a rejection i have EVER heard, and i thought i'd seen it all"
"This almost /physically/ pains me. I remember this one time, when I was a kid, I went out with my best friend and her parents and she broke her shoe. Her parents just took us to a store and bought her a new pair. No waiting. No ""We'll deal with it some other day, just hang on a couple more hours until we get home."" No in-depth exploration of the best value-for-money shoes. That entire experience blew my mind, and I realized that not every family lived like mine did. "
"When my husband and I first started dating and we were in bed together for the first time, he let out a long, appreciative ""fuuuuuckk"" when I took my top off. 5 years later, I still think back on that and feel sexy. "
"I sat down and within 15 minutes he says:

""My aunt owns the theater down the street. Last week I met this homeless girl on the street and we had sex without a condom in the bathroom of the theater. It was super spontaneous and sexy."" 

And then he *winked* at me. "
"Undertaker here. In my experience this is a very real and true statement. Almost all of the  women I've ever dealt with who didn't die from illness or accidents were murdered by their male partners or men they knew. I've been doing this for almost 15 years and I've never had a guy murdered by his female patner but every female murder was commited by a male known to the woman. When men get frustrated they lash out. Its sad and I hope that we can have discussions and start to change this. Women are not objects or the enemy, they are fellow human beings. Men are weak because they resort to violence insted of facing their problems."
"Yesterday at 2 am he rolled over, put his arm over me and told me ""You can be number one at anything you want to do."" He swears he has no ides what he was dreaming about lol."
"&gt; Their mom is slightly racist, where you can tell that she definitely holds prejudices, (she'll literally go out of her way to take the highway to our house, which adds about 15 more minutes, instead of just going through the city, because, gasp, it's a predominantly black neighbor), but she's not a member of the KKK or anything. 

Thats a little more than *slightly* racist. You dont need to be burning crosses to be racist."
"For me it was realising I felt strongly about our life, not him alone.

 I loved our morning routines, I loved our family. I dreaded listening to him speak on his passions. I didn't strive for his opinions or thoughts on anything in my life. I found him so handsome.. when his hair and beard were styled just so. A bad haircut or hat would off put me to the point of silent embarrassment. I loved our adventures.. when we were enjoying companionable silence, and his words jarred me.

It was always so situational. So lovely on the surface but so brittle. We never really fought or had problems, and we were so close, but something was too situational about it all. Too formulated. Too ingrained. The grooves we wore in creating our routine were perfect but only because we never deviated from that path and we dug ourselves deeper and deeper to the point we couldn't get our wheels on another track. We only fit in that one space. "
"Coffee date. Pleasant enough but I really wasn't that into him. Made an excuse that I needed to go grab something to eat. As we were leaving the coffee shop:

Him: So how about you grab dinner and I grab dinner and we meet back at my place and finish this?

Me: No

Him: Can I kiss you?

Me: No 

*Walks away*"
We eloped to the Virgin Islands almost 11 years ago and were married on the beach. I had a very simple dress and we were by ourselves. I did have a few photos taken but nothing extravagant. I don't regret it. We saved so much money and were  able to put it towards a house. 
"""Glorp. Glorp. Glorp. That's the sound it makes"""
"Not me, but a friend had this date a few months ago. He was yelling all night and standing up at random intervals. Also audibly farting, often. He asked her the same questions multiple times, forgetting he had already asked. He didn’t notice when he knocked over his beer, and asked a few minutes later where his beer went. My favorite is that he asked her when she was a kid what she wanted to be when she was older. She was giving a normal answer, and when she was close to done he interrupted her to shout that he wanted to be a ninja and jumped up from his seat. We still aren’t sure what the hell he took beforehand."
It was technically after the first date and he sent me a text asking if I had fun. I said thank you for drinks but I don't think I'd like to hang out again. Then he asked if he could masturbate to the thought of me at least.
What an edge Lord 
"I love the way *halcyon* looks. It even has a pretty meaning.

I'm similarly enamoured of the word *soliloquy*. Isn't it just nice to look at? The *l*s roll off the tongue so nicely.

*Ephemeral*. *Ethereal*.

In my native language, *effleurer*, which means to touch lightly, to brush against. I feel like the lightness of the *ff* and *l* fit so well with the definition."
"I was in 4th grade, just moved to a new state and had started school. One day, we had a test that was split into part 1 before recess, part 2 after recess. I saw some of my friends had smuggled their notes in their jackets and were reviewing them during recess. I thought it was cheating, so when we were all called inside, I told the teacher.

The teacher then made me stand in front of the room and name the kids who I saw cheating, in front of everyone. I was terrified so I just did it without thinking. Those kids iced me out hard and I felt so awful. In hindsight, that was a stupid way for the teacher to handle it, and I'm still kind of salty about it in that long-term childhood grudge way, lol."
"Peanut allergy. 

I’m sorry but I will not give up Reeses for anyone. "
"We were at a park by the beach. I had to pee. Couldn't find a bathroom. So I went behind a bush, then looked up to see him watching me.

""Uh, you want to explain to me what the *fuck* you're doing?"" I ask, glaring up from my mid-piss squat.

""Watching you,"" he answers. ""This really turns me on."" "
I schedule my sweatiest workouts on days that I would be washing my hair anyway. 
"Whenever we went to bed he would say ""Thank thee oh Lord for these thy gifts which I am about to receive..."" It always made me laugh."
"An old man, probably around 80, stopped me in walmart just to talk. I asked him if he thought he knew me and he said no. but continued to talk, then tried to hug and kiss me.  I was so freaked out I just left, didn't pick up anything I needed. "
"I used to work with a guy like that.  Late 50's, grew up with wealthy parents, had a pretty successful career in sales (he was the sales rep for our company).  He believes to his core that poor people are just lazy.  Because if you need more money.  Just go make more money.  It's not rocket science according to him.  He and I argued about this from time to time.

He was at our office once for a meeting and talking about high end cars and ones he liked.  He was going on and on about the Ferrari 458 and how he hoped to get one some day if things lined up right.  And I asked him why he didn't just make more money to get it?  I mean, it's not rocket science, if you need more money for the car just go earn more.  Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mike Dell could all easily afford that car multiple times over.  I guess those guys would think we're all just a bunch of lazy bums.  
He didn't take it to well.  His co-workers laughter didn't help.  "
I did. Just now. Hopefully that aura reaches him wherever in the world he is.
"I was just reading another thread about minimum wage jobs and someone commented ""that job isn't worth your time"", suggesting someone quit their shitty grocery store cart pushing job.

But that job most likely allows that person to buy food and pay bills. No one works a shitty minimum wage job if they don't have to. "
"I met him at his apartment, and he asked me to cut his hair ""because he likes to look good when he goes out"". Guess he didn't feel like he should look good before our first date? Also I was a barista, not a hairdresser. Then he asked if I'd like to ride motorbikes before we went to the restaurant and I said no (I'm in a dress, heels, hair done in date mode) he says ""ok I'm just going to go for a quick spin to relax before we go"" hopped on his bike, and took off. I left. Sad thing is he spent several visits to the coffee shop charming me to go out with him to begin with, and the next day started back up flirting with me to try to get me to go out with him again."

"He was running late for our date -- an MLB baseball game. I live in an extremely hot environment, and this day was particularly hot. I waited for him outside the ballpark and he came running up and was kinda sweaty. No big deal. 

I gave him the benefit of the doubt, but as soon as we were in the door, he scurried off to the bathroom. He spent, I shit you not, probably 15 minutes in the bathroom. When he came out he was DRENCHED in water. I guess he was feeling self-conscious about being sweaty, but this made it so much worse. And much more obvious. 

We went to get some beers, and the first thing the guy at the concession stand says is ""WOW! It's THAT hot outside?!"" Date is visibly flustered and we went to find our seats.

I tried to put his mind at ease. When he put his beer in the cup holder, he then proceeded to knock it out and dump beer all over himself. 

He ran away without saying anything. I felt really bad for the guy. When he came back, he had an ENTIRELY NEW SHIRT with the team's logo. I said ""Oh, new shirt!"" He was like ""Yeah, I'm feeling the team spirit..."" I asked what happened to his other nice button-down shirt. He said he threw it away. 

Finally we settle into the game and he starts to relax. A couple comes and sits next to us. He greets them, clearly familiar with who they are. He introduces me and says ""Do you know who that is?"" Of course I didn't. ""That's my sister!"" I don't know why he would think I know who his sister is? 

That was a weird one. "
"We were having a discussion as a group of friends and talked about how this girl used to play the harp but had to stop as she couldnt take it with her to university (in a different country). One girl came out with ""now i know what im gonna get her for her birthday"". Harps cost thousands of dollars. Sweet girl. No understanding of the value of money."
"this can set in after many, many years together, but there is still hope as long as it once WAS stimulating. that means there was something there.

if it's been like this from the start though, you know what you must do! if it never was any good, even in the beginning when the sun shone out of their ass, it will never be better than that."
"Emotional connection. Things are great on the surface, but when it comes down to the real things that matter, we’re never on the same page. There’s always been a lack of understanding about how I feel or what I want, and I get pushed over or shut down."
There's presumptuous. Then there's this😂
"Talked about his nasty divorce practically the whole time. Wasn't sooo bad since he also talked about how it changed his life, made him see relationships differently, and helped him appreciate people/relationships more.. what was the cringe part was when he talked about meeting his girlfriend and how much he loved her. On a date. With me. 
"
"I was dd’ing my 2 friends one night and we pulled up to our dorm parking deck at 2:00am. As we got out of the car, a guy walked up to us and said, “can I ask you a question?”

Before I could respond, “no”, he grabbed my shirt, stuck a gun into my stomach and said, “don’t you dare fucking move or I’ll shoot.”

At that moment a car sped up and stopped right behind my car and the passenger door flung open and another guy jumped out. He lunged for my friend and she lost him by ducking between the cars. 

I was still standing with the gun in my stomach, and without thinking threw my purse into the air. This distracted the dude and he ran for the purse. In that moment I sprinted away and my friends and I all made it to the front doors of our dorm.

I transferred schools shortly after and I’m super cautious about where I park at night.

"I keep trying to explain to my boyfriend why I feel scared when random men strike up a conversation with me, and he really does not get it. "
"I was in Starbucks in NYC, when a woman asked if she could share my table. She noticed I was reading and said she wished she'd brought a book. I offered her mine, since I was done.  She thanked me, then started telling me about her ex husband, who never let her buy books. ""Because he's a Jew. And they're so cheap!""  

I'm Jewish. Left in a hurry, wishing I could take back that book."
I fucking love it.
"I did after the fact.  I don't like letting people stay blind to things that actually affect other people, especially if they are fairly open minded like he is."
I would say it would only be a deal breaker if he maintained the idea after being enlightened. It would worry me that there's probably going to be some serious MIL issues down the road though.

"So, there is a kind of abstinence-only sex education where they teach kids to abstain, but they don't tell them what sex is in the first place. So you just get told to abstain, but you don't actually know from what you're abstaining.

"My daughter and I woke up early, letting dad sleep in. 

These 3 things happened simultaneously: 

1. I’m standing in the kitchen and husband wakes up, hugs me, and says he had a dream our ceiling fell in. 

2. A few beats later, my daughter’s cartoon (“Harry and his Bucketful of Dinosaurs”) on TV announces the beginning of the episode as “The Ceiling Drip” with an animation of a ceiling drip, drip, dripping into a bucket. 

3. I start to point out this crazy coincidence to my husband, like his dream predicted the future, but instead I glanced up at our ceiling and a huge water stain had covered the entire ceiling overnight. I started speaking words, but I’m sure they didn’t make sense, bc I was so freaked out and could only point. 

We had to have the ceiling torn down and redone. It was an expensive coincidence. "
"When I moved from San Luis Obispo, CA  to the city of Santa Clara, CA, I started going to a community college in the area. I was surprised by how many overly sheltered kids in the area went to my school. A big part of the reason for most of them as to why they were even going to CC instead of a university was so they can be near their parents for another 2 years before transferring instead of moving out at 18. They could afford the 4 year but their parents didn't want them to go just yet. 

However, there was one girl who was a bit older than most students there, like myself \(21 years old\), but I swear she acted and talked like a teenager. We were in the same program so we ran into each other fairly often  and one day she went looking for me because she was sooo excited to tell me that the day before she went to the grocery store all by herself. That she was really nervous since she didn't know what would happen but everything turned out just fine! She mentioned how it was an adrenaline rush to her since it was the first time going anywhere besides school without her parents."
"Interesting because women get humiliated too, yet we don’t think of blows to our ego as death. Are men more emotional and more sensitive than women? Because we’re regularly accused of being too emotional and too sensitive. "
"My neighbor tried to break into my house but he was creeping on my house for a month or two prior.

I found a half eaten apple under my porch.  It was in a place where there is no way it could have been tossed or dropped by a critter.

I found a package of half eaten donuts in my backyard.

One evening, my pets acted like someone was at the door but no one was at the door.

I included all of the above in the police report so always note suspicious or unusual activity.  Guy was sentenced to 12 years, served 7 and became my neighbor again after he got out of prison.  Good times!"
My boyfriend talks in his sleep almost every night. One night he said “they’re trying to take my blood” and I was so creeped out. The other night I was awake at 3 AM and he started giggling in his sleep. It’s hilarious and would creep me out so much more if I wasn’t so used to it. 
"If you think about breaking up often or if you've communicated your issues but that nothing has changed. My ex and I had so many talks over the last few months, but nothing changed and at the end of the day, he had given up on the relationship months ago. "
"Hubby was standing &amp; waiting on me in the kitchen, having a conversation with both his brother &amp; myself.

As he's talking, I walked up and I remove  the clip that was holding up my hair and just did a slow  head shake to free my hair, wasn't trying to be sexy or anything,  it was just one of those days where your hair is being flipping fantastic.

He literally just stopped talking, like completely forgot what he was saying and was speechless for a few seconds, before clearing his throat and asking us both  we were ready to go.

That had never happened before and yeah it totally made me feel sexy."
"Tinder, of course. He was very charming via text and very NOT charming in person. "
asked what my cup size was I said something crazy because it was an awkward question like “3000 triple z” and he casually responded “nice” without actually knowing what I said was a completely false joke. Cringey asf 
"Ah, I see you've been negged."
"My wife and I met online.  She was from a big city and I lived out in the middle of nowhere.  She used to joke about me possibly being a crazy axe murderer, and I giggled but realized her concern had some merits (theoretically at least).  I was in the process of getting a new car when we finally decided to meet and couldn't risk the long drive to the city at the time.  She was really brave and made the trip herself.  I made sure that when she arrived my sister and her SO were at my place along with a few of my friends and that we only went to public places where there would be other friendly people.

Later, I found out that all of her friends were actually really worried when she left and that a caravan was planned to intercept the axe murderer if they weren't contacted by a certain time.  I'm glad my wife has such good friends, and now we all live together in the same city!"
Maybe it's made of extremely rare tropical fish?
"Oh no. I thought your story was going to be similar to mine. Glad you’re ok.

I was a broke college student but felt bad for a homeless man outside a coffee shop. He asked me to buy him a coffee and that was the transaction that overdrew my account which resulted in a 30 dollar fee as well. "
"I remind myself that this is actually a good thing, in terms of revealing society's progress. 

Casual misogyny has been the accepted norm since time immemorial. The fact that people are calling others out is a sign of progress. The fact that we're having these discussions at all is progress. The fact that certain individuals are railing against enlightenment and change is progress; they didn't have to rail against anything before, because there was nothing to rail against. Now there is.

It's still frustrating, certainly, but things always get worse before they get better. Consider the outting of sexual predators en masse in the entertainment industries now. At a glance, one might say, ""God, look how many women have been abused, look how these men got away with it, I'm so angry!"" And that's true. But what's also true is that these predators have always existed, and now we're finally beginning to do something about it. We're finally becoming strong enough, heard enough, respected enough to force change.

It's slow, and maddening, but it's happening. Become a part of the change in the world around you, and be hopeful. "

"I had a roommate in university who came from a wealthy family and even had connections to the uni I went to. Her family basically never cooked, always ate out, *never* had leftovers. So this girl was just like clueless about daily things. She was intelligent but didn't have an ounce of cultural awareness or anything.

One day I get back to our dorm (it was an apartment style dorm) and she tells me she wants to make chicken for dinner, she bought some from Walmart nearby. 

Turns out, she didn't know you had to ***thaw*** the chicken if it was in the freezer. She straight up thought she could put it from the freezer to the pan. I ended up showing her how to thaw it out with cold water, since there really wasn't enough time...I still can't believe it to this day that she had no idea."

"I was in the passenger seat of his truck that had one long front seat as we were heading to dinner. I buckled up and we headed off, then he asked me to move and sit in the middle to be next to him. I said I was fine and wanted to stay where I was. He unbuckled my seat belt and insisted I moved while we were driving; I buckled it back and said I just wanted to stay where I was. Several rounds of him unbuckling it and me doing it back he pulled into the turning lane, stopped the truck and said he wouldn't keep going unless I moved to the center. So I said fuck this take me home now and after him arguing/whining and trying to say he was ""just kidding"" luckily he actually did; I'm still surprised that he didn't just leave me where we stopped.

"Here in the Philippines, I think the most common expletive is “puta” / “putang ina mo”. “Puta” is a borrowed word from Spanish which literally means “whore”. “Ina” means mother while “mo” denotes connection with the person being spoken to. Thus, “putang ina mo” = “your mother is a whore”. "
"Yeah, that's true. I've only ever personally been afraid of two men. One tried to abduct me when i was 12. One tried to break into my house in the middle of the night when I was 40. My friends have had other encounters with scary men - one narrowly escaped being dragged into a van by three men. One was beaten and gang raped by strangers she met at a bar. One was raped, strangled and left for dead on the side of a highway by a guy she had just broken up with.

I, on the other hand, have been called ""intimidating"" by men on a few occasions, and it usually seems to mean I'm smart and witty and i don't put up with any bullshit. Sometimes it even comes across as a compliment. * shrug *. "
"&gt;afraid of ending up alone

I'm a woman in her mid 30s, who got divorced a few years back. Don't dread ending up alone. Dread ending up with someone who you can't live to your fullest with. Enjoy the dating process. It's not some sprint to the finish to find a guy to make babies with because your clock is ticking. F the clock. You rush to something, you make mistakes. "
"I really like how you were just expected to know that he got that for you because he expected you to use it before your next date. ""Duh, you were supposed to give those hooves of yours a spa day for my pleasure, how did you not know that?!"" Like he just forgot to do the Vulcan mind meld before the end of that date or something. "
"Romantic: has no time for me, drinks a whole fucking lot, only cares about himself during sex, a slob

"I grew up in a shitty home with an abuser and an enabler, and I'm well aware that I haven't really begun to unfuck myself enough to be a caring, supportive partner, so I know I've been a shitty partner in the past. A lot of it is a ""my way or the highway"" mentality, and being really awful at communicating how I'm feeling in an even-tempered manner when I'm upset."
"\( i dont even like kids. i dont want any. they are gross to me. but i am human\)

a neighbor kid was crying outside while i was taking out the trash. i felt bad to just leave them there. so i asked if they were locked out their apartment. \(that used to always happen to me\) he didnt really speak \(also he had to be about 7\-10 years old\) i asked if anyone was home. he said no. i asked if i could walk him back to his apartment, he was able to get in but no one was there. i did know what to do. so i asked if he wanted to wait for his mother at my place \(it was about to rain otherwise i would have just hung outside with him\). I KNOW how stupid that was but i lived there a year and didnt feel like a stranger. ugh. anyway we played videogames till my bf came home and i told him the issue. he said thats fine. 2 hours pass and i saw his mom pull up. i told him to tell his mom everything and to have a good day. 

next morning his mother comes over to yell at me. saying they called the cops and everything looking for their son. i was socked and felt terrible. she then tells me that his grandfather saw the whole thing from the downstairs apartment. i was shaken and asked her why he didnt come out when he saw me talk to his grandson? i explained and apologized over and over. after that i just avoided everyone in the complex. i felt like an idiot and predator. 

the little kid i know felt even worse. so yeah. never again. "
I would. I would have loved to spend more on our wedding. I would have been happy to drop thousands more of it meant we could have invited more people and had more flowers. 
"I met a group of people online, maybe 6-8 people I got along really well with. Among the group was one guy in particular who seemed like he was a nice guy at first, but things slowly started to go downhill.

The first thing was he kept asking me for my real name even though I had said multiple times that I don't give out my real name without a very good reason. His version of a good reason was ""I want to name a character after you in the video game I'm playing""

I made a comment to a different guy in the group about his accent (i.e. that it sounded good) and this guy suddenly starts going ""oh I have the same accent (he did admittedly live in the same country) I'll come live where you are and you can hear it all the time"" which is just... wtf?

At this point I blocked him on Snapchat, and asked another friend in the group (who I actually trusted) to essentially use all resources at his disposal to try and find out my identity online, just to see if this other guy could potentially do it. Thankfully he could not.

That didn't stop the creepy guy from trying though, he kept adding me on new social media platforms etc (I tended to accept it and immediately block him so he had no idea he was being blocked - had a feeling he might get aggressive if he knew) and asking me about facebook, which I told him I didn't use (I do, but under my real name), and asking me for photos of myself (which I had already told him many times I would not do). 

Essentially it was a ton of fairly small but super creepy things, to the point where I legitimately ended up on edge that he would somehow find me and show up on my doorstep uninvited. Thankfully he never learned what city I am in, only the country. 

I have him blocked on everything except twitch (where I met this whole group) and every time I go into a stream one of them is holding he is always there and always tries to start a one-on-one conversation with me. I just pretend I don't see his messages.

Later found out he hits on every girl who shows up in the group, so I disclosed to said girls what he had been doing, and they said he had been nowhere near as creepy as he was with me. They had my back though which is always nice, they call him out when he makes creepy comments in chat etc. It's been a couple of years since I blocked him on stuff and it seems to have done the job, but I always worry about the girls who came after me and if they;d had to deal with the same thing :/"
"Nope, I just figured that you can’t give money to someone and tell them what to spend it on, and just resolved to be more careful in future. Our friendship ended a few years later when he pulled a surprise Nice Guy on me when I started seriously dating a guy he didn’t like."
"Freshman in college hanging out with my BFF and her dorm roommate. We were all virgins at the time but my friend and I were pretty open to talking about sex and we started joking about masturbating and how we masturbated as kids before we even knew what it was. The roommate comes out with the fact that she's never masturbated before, not religious or anything, just never thought to do it. We encouraged her to try it if she felt comfortable. She did that night and within two days we all went to a sex shop and bought our first real vibrators together. Kind of weird but it was nice to have support when going to a sex shop for the first time! "

"Celery.

It would be a beautiful name if it didn't mean plant stick."
I’d say it’s accurate. Go to r/niceguys. There are grown men throwing fits acting like they’re being abused for *being rejected*. While the nature of that subreddit is meant for the more hyperbolic of entitled men...it is totally freaking accurate. The last time I was asked out in public...I’m pretty sure I checked my surroundings to make sure we weren’t alone. 
"Honestly I have a hard time understanding his fears. And because of this, I tend to undermine how hard it might be for him to do certain things. You would think someone with anxiety would understand someone else’s anxiety ... nope. I am trying really hard to be more loving even when his fears sometimes make no sense to me. He’s my world and I want to be as supportive as I can for him. But not gonna lie, sometimes I just sit down and think “I’m ... such a terrible girlfriend.”

edit: forgot that I got promoted to terrible wife two months ago. "
"I went to a movie date with a guy who was silent the entire dinner before hand, who once the lights went out tried to put his hands in my pants.

"The first time I ate over at my sister inlaws house they were having burritos. I was an Irish kid from New Jersey and this was in “the valley” in California.  They told me to go help my self in the kitchen and I saw tortillas and all these fixings and had never seen a tortilla before.  I had to go ask someone to explain it to me and they all had a good laugh. I’m a burrito queen now, enchiladas and Chile relenos  even!"
"Also not woman-centric, but I percentage-wise it is much more relatable to women: Being sexually assaulted and freezing up. Everyone thinks ""i'd kick him/her in the nuts/face! I'd scream my head off! I'd fight to the death! No way would I just sit there and let someone do that to me!"" 

You don't know that. You don't know what you would do until you're in it and god I hope you never are. "
"One night I woke up thinking my husband (then boyfriend) was saying something to me and groggily asked him what he was saying. Still dead asleep he says agitatedly, “I’m trying to tell the story of Jesus Christ!” and rolled over and started snoring. "
"A girl that I grew up with didn't believe in sex before marriage but she would have anal sex with her boyfriend since that doesn't count? Also, she said that she would ""masturbate"" to her that meant getting naked for men on the internet. When I explained what masturbating was she was so offended. ❓ "
omg I would have been SO UPSET

"I’m 33. Living with my parents for 4 years while I save for a down payment on a house / look for a house. Its so bad I recently started therapy. Luckily I found a house and I’m under contract!! Closing isn’t until July but just knowing I’m moving out is such a huge weight off my shoulders. I’m sad I’m doing it alone and not with a partner, but I’m so happy to be getting out of this house. "

"Cleanliness. Went out with a super cute guy i gelled with really well. Headed to hang at his place, it was kind of filthy and gross, and it completely ruined him for me. I couldn’t look at him without thinking about the several beer bottles and general clutter and how poorly kept the whole place looked. "
sooo true. honestly give me a premature ejaculator to a dude that's ruined himself with death grip.
So how does she think the baby gets in there in the first place?
"I don't know about how men feel and their fears, but I've been afraid many times in my life of being stalked, harassed, or assaulted.  Murder, I have an indirect fear of, I've been lucky that I haven't been in a situation where I've gone ""this guy is going to kill me now"" but that's the logical conclusion of harassment, stalking, assault that I avoid thinking of directly."
"Fundamentally, it is \- so it really should be. We need to update our laws for the digital age, because we do live our lives online, and our laws should reflect that. "
"Walking alone down an empty street and a black van with tinted windows comes up behind me. I get as far off to the side of the road as I can to give it space \(No sidewalks\)  and it starts really slowing down almost to a halt. This is'nt the first time this sort of thing has happened so I turn to face it, trying to get a good look through the windshield and I see three grown men watching me. One points and the other nudges the driver while saying something, the driver comes to a complete stop in response.  One of them grins and winks at me while the other opens the sliding door to the van. At this point of course I know it'd be stupid to try to run away or run past them \(It was a one way side street with walls on both sides\) so I establish eye contact, took a firm stance, pull out my phone and my pepper spray and yell ""Don't even think about it."". This actually made them stop, the one looks at the driver who shakes his head, the guy who winked at me shrugs. They close the door and drive off. The one who winked maintained eye contact the entire time. I don't think I'll ever forget those eyes and it still gives me the shudders to remember."
"From my own dating and the experience of friends, I'd say it's having children that ups the difficulty, not ageing. I'm in my 30s and c.f. and haven't really noticed any difference at all, but my friends who are single mums (even if they haven't got to 30 yet) have a waaay harder time of it. Just the logistics alone of dating when you're a single parent can be a nightmare, let alone finding any decent dates."
"I think the self cleaning things are otherwise known as housekeepers...ahh, rich people...lol"
Indecisiveness. Not being able to function as an adult by making your own choices and basically want me to guide you in life really get my goat. 
I kinda suspect that's the idea.

"I was out getting groceries one day and when I was at the checkout line, there was this old man on a scooter in front of me and when I glanced at him, he tapped his nose and it literally glowed red like Rudolph, like he had an LED in his nose or something. No one else saw it!"
"I love this so much. creepy but .. endearing? Did she mean your dog told her? Or was ""she"" in reference to something/someone unseen?
"
"We just each do our fair share because we don't see the other as our maid and care for and respect the other; and we let the other do their stuff their way and on their own timeline as we both assume the other is a competent adult. If the other is not doing their share, we tell them without anger; if the other calls us out on not doing our share, we listen and make more efforts.

I don't know, it's very simple and natural. It's just normal, no? Like we're a team and this is *our* home, why wouldn't we both pull our weight? I don't feel like it's something we manage to do with a specific method.

ETA: we have roughly the same cleanliness standards (both slobs) and are willing to compromise where it differs, which is another key piece in fairness being easily achieved."
Oh you forgot the one where you want to turn a guy down and have to walk that tight rope between making sure he understands that it’s definitely a “no” but also being nice about it so as not to provoke him.

"I’m not the girlfriend anymore, but after my ex and I broke up, I started to really realize how bad some of my behaviors and habits were and it positively mortifies me. I was very clingy and not understanding enough, and I let my depression and anxiety take me over and ruin our relationship. It makes me extremely embarrassed to think about the things I did. "
Melancholy 
"And anyone on the other side, where you're earning a bit better and not checking your bank account before a cup of coffee: please be mindful! I know that it's unfair to pay for everything in a relationship\- of any kind, not just romantic\- but if someone isn't as well\-off, or whatever the case might be, try to remember what a burden, embarrassment, and feeling of shame can come with mentioning that you don't have the money for a pottery class/ cup of latte/ outing/ drinks and dinner. Again, I don't want to pay for everything \(I've been there, and it's unfair and led to resentment\), but there has to be a balance with money! Not in professional settings like the one I mention above, I mean social relationships "
"Very accurate. Have been raped by one bf, given a black eye by another. Have a friend that has been slapped in the face, beat, and been told “I am going to kill you,” by her bf. Literally every woman I know, including my mom and sister, has been raped or physically assaulted by a man at least once. We are not of a low socioeconomic background, we are well educated, we are self aware women and still we are victims. The quote is accurate. "

Insecurity to the point it hurts our relationship. This severe insecurity I have found leads to other bad behaviors like extreme inconsolable jealousy.
This is why we need sex-ed in schools
"I've lost about 30 pounds \(only 24 more to go!\), and people feel the need to comment on just about everything I eat. If I get a salad, I get, ""How can you eat that rabbit food?"" Well, because this Asian chicken salad is fucking delicious! If I splurge and eat a burger, I get, ""Aren't you on a diet?"" Yes, and I've planned for this meal. One person in my life is really obnoxious about it. I follow Weight Watchers and any time I eat a small piece of candy or something, she'll say, ""That's \[x\] points!"" Yes, I fucking know. I literally just tracked it.

Just let me eat a damn meal in peace!"
"When I entered college I thought my male friends were ""teasing"" when they talked about how girls weren't good at math or asked me to go make a sandwich or or or or. By the time I exited college I'd realized, huh, a lot of those guys are kidding on the square / kidding-notkidding. It was a sad fucking day when I realized who wasn't actually joking. "
I had one guy turn up to a first date with a bottle of Jack Daniels for me. I think I got the better gift!
"As an Asian person, I find that I actually judge people who are unwilling to try food from different cultures. I can understand if you have allergies or can't tolerate strong flavors, but shutting a food down just because you're not used to it is dumb. I used to work at a Chinese restaurant and have had people ask if we have burgers, fries, chicken fingers, etc. "
It grew razor sharp teeth and bites off any penis that comes within contact of it.
"I was at Walmart about a year ago and I was looking at the adult coloring books. A guy, probably mid 30s, walks up to me and says “oh, just so you know there’s another section down another aisle!” I say thank you and he walks away. Okay, harmless enough, I think. I start walking down the clothing section to cut through to the food and notice he’s behind me. Okay, coincidence. But, he’s acting like he’s hiding. He’s  going behind displays but keeping a close distance and whenever I start walking, he does, and whenever I stop he stops and “looks at things”. This goes on for THREE sections and this point I’m almost doing zig zags in Walmart all spread out to see if he follows, and he does. I live(d) in a city where human trafficking was bad, it was all over the news and I was terrified. I go to turn into a busy aisle and BAM, a guy friend of mine is there. I truly could not of been happier to see him, and asked if he’d be willing to shop with me, and I did not see the guy after that. I thank my lucky stars for that timing because I had JUST moved to this area and he was legitimately the only friend I had, so how strange that I bumped into him. To this day I still spooked out by it."
"My first year after college I lived alone in a studio apt with my 65 lb Aussie Shepherd mix. He slept out of his kennel at night. One night I wake up to this terrifying growling that I have never heard him make. Through the moonlight you could see all the fur on the back of his neck was straight up and he walked slowly to the front door (which was along the same wall as my bed and I could see). I see the handle of the front door slowly turning, as if someone was trying to open it as quietly as possible. Charlie (dog) gets next to the door and the growling is louder. I see the handle slowly turning back to it's original position and hear soft padded footsteps down the hall, like someone is sneaking away. Didn't sleep the rest of the night and called my bf. Looked out the peephole and no one was there. Cops couldn't do anything and said it could've been someone mistaking my door for their own. But why were they turning the handle so slowly???"
"&gt; but even if it was true she deserved it

What the fuck man..."
"Before an abuser ever lays a hand on a partner, they will ruin all their partners personal relationships, take control of the flow of money, or limit a partner's ability to physically get away. 

One of my friend's sisters just got out of an abusive relationship. He persuaded her to move to a new area where she knew no one, convinced her she should quit her job and be a homemaker, and convinced her to sell her car so they could buy a new one but only put it in his name.  Once she had little to no resources available to her, he started the physical abuse. You might have some warning bells go off  before the physical abuse but, if you have no reason to distrust your partner up to this point, you could easily be put into a situation where leaving is extremely difficult . "
This was a decade or so ago and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if he hadn’t. His valedictorian speech (in a public school) included him talking about loving god over yourself and his own “fleshy desires”. Finding out what happened to him is one of the only reasons I would want to go to a reunion. 
That's awful. Hope you're well.
"But.... WHY??? Did she not like them enough to ever wear them again? Did she think they were just temporary? She threw away two pairs of shoes that day - what's she gonna wear tomorrow?

I once went on a day trip and when I got there and started walking around, I looked at my feet and realized I had worn the wrong shoes. I was wearing my ratty old ""take out the trash"" shoes which I'd put on to pack up the car, and I forgot to change into real shoes.

So I walked into a shoe store and bought a new pair of $70 shoes. I felt a little bit ridiculous. I regretted so much not remembering to change my shoes before I left and wrestled with whether I should really drop 70 bucks on a brand new pair of shoes right now when all my other pairs at home are still perfectly good.

It turned out okay, I really like them and I still wear them every day. Just kidding, I threw them in the trash when I got home."
"They didn’t even attempt to explain WHY it’s worth it. 
&gt;This dress is worth every cent because it’s worth every cent so before you diss its price tag remember that it’s worth every cent."
"I always felt, in equal measures, guilt and doubt when he talked about our ""future"". This is when he talked about moving to the quiet suburbs, but I was always a city person. Or when we discussed and disagreed vehemently on how to raise children. 

I kept trying to convince him (and myself) that I wanted the same things as him, but I ended up not being able to fake it anymore. He saw it too, but we swept it under the rug. We spent weeks and months wrestling each other in the dirtiest dirt pit of resentment.

It should have ended much, *much* earlier than it should have. 

So to answer your question, you should split up when your desires don't match up. Some things can be worked on, but some can't. "

"Sadly a good friend of mine that I've known a while, in fact one of my best guy friends (I'm a dude), who is extremely intelligent in all the right ways except for one. Despite having a number of relationships he still rants and raves to me about his overall generalized hate for women, as if they're plotting against him in some way. I don't have the wherewithal to listen to him on the phone any longer due to his incessant need to bring up how he thinks women and their use of makeup is a purposeful ruse to trick men. If I wasn't on my phone I'd link the conversation I had with him about makeup where he states ""they choose to lie and misrepresent themselves."" I confronted him on it and of course he dug in deeper. I actively avoid conversations with him now because of it. "
"We eloped at the courthouse and had 2 friends as witnesses. I didn’t wear a white wedding dress then, but we flew to Europe immediately afterwards and we both wore wedding attire for a “wedding” photography shoot at a gorgeous locale. We tried to be practical as we are in no way well-off: my husband wore a new suit that he could wear to work, and I wore a $500 dress. It was actually just an awesome excuse for us to trek mountains in the snow and go on an adventure! 

My parents-in-law are holding a small reception at a restaurant next month for our “wedding” as a way to celebrate with family. It’s not something we asked for, so they’ve planned and paid for everything. It’s also taking place 7 months after we got married. "

It's a 4 hour round trip drive for me and I really wanted to be there for her because I knew it was going to be a tough day and I was also concerned that he might get violent if she was alone \- and I'm geographically the closest family member. I've mentioned her on this sub before \- she suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder. She felt that by offering to be there for her I was undermining her by making her feel ""incompetent and useless"" and that it meant I didn't trust her. SMH. I didn't know what to say to that. I really only wanted to be there for her to show her my support, to lend a hand with moving her stuff, and as a back up in case things went south. Loving someone with a personality disorder can be tricky. They want you to love them to specific standards. It's like taking the damn GRE to figure out how they want to be loved \- and sometimes even once you've figured it out it changes with the weather. But she's my sister so I'll continue to be there for her \(whether she likes it or not, I guess?\)"
"I have no deal breakers and that’s the dealbreaker.

"I went on a first date once where I asked him to bring drinks. The plan was to walk down to the ocean and have a beer, chat, hang out.

He unzips the back pack and there's a couple of leather whips, some nylon rope, hand cuffs, and a giant Louisville slugger sized dildo with a weird purple stain on the end (for some reason the stain has haunted me ever since). He then sort of waggles his eyebrows at me. I said, ""Um.. no thanks."" He then topped it off by saying not to worry, his wife was ok with it. Then he asked if we could ""kiss to see what it feels like"". Noped the fuck out of there. "

That’s what I have been thinking. Thank you. 
"She grabs me from behind and kisses my upper back/around my neck. 

Pushes/pins me into the wall/door frame/tree and kisses me. 

Yuuup. "
"I feel a bit weird when I get the impression that someone prepared for a date like first a test...so any questions that sound natural are fine, anything too rehearsed can be awkward. I think talking about the things you actually do irl is more relevant than too get real questions  (i. e.  What were the last 3 books you read tells me more than What genre of literature do you prefer ) "
"I was in the bra/underwear section of Target. I had my sunglasses on my head. 

A guy comes up to me and says ""can you wear your sunglasses?""

Me: ""no?""

Guy: ""can I wear them?""

Me: ""no?!!""

Guy: ""why not?""

Me: ""because they're mine.""

Then I walked away. I had a very confused disgusted look. 

It was so odd. I made sure he wasn't following me when I left the store. He was creepy. "
"I was horrified. I did respond and said something like, ""why the hell would you even say that to me?"" And he said he thought it would turn me on."
"I'll be doing something really mundane like changing clothes or putting my makeup on and he leans back with this *grin* and just motions up and down at me and says ""I'm so lucky I get to date you"" and it never fails to make me smile"
"I was messaging this guy on kik. We’d just started, never met or anything. All he had was a low quality picture of me in a dark room.

He decided he loved me, cut my name into his arm to prove it and sent me a pic of that"
The mom and the grandfather should be scolded actually. What if you *were* a child molester? They should take better care of that kid if they don't want the kid to be hanging in neighbors' houses.
"Sitting across from each other at dinner, he's like ""give me your hands!"" Because he said us touching would relax me and I was like ummm I'm not super touchy at first? And then he just grabs them and is like see isn't this better?

Then after that, he tells me he forgot something in his car and then basically jumps me and starts making out with me/wants me to get in his backseat while we're in a parking garage. Then when I was like uh I'm uncomfortable he was like haha you're so cute, I'm going to put you in my trunk and take you back to my place. Yeah the date was over then and I never saw/spoke to him again. "
"The lack of an exciting sex life. 

I always heard jokes about how the woman doesn't want sex anymore so they only have sex once a month or less... but I knew that I'm a sexually liberated woman. I LOVE sex. That would NEVER be a problem in my life. 

It turns out men can lose their libido too. FML  "
This one is super fucking creepy
"If their voice is really loud and you have had to train yourself to not appear embarrassed when you’re out in public.

Never considered it to be a deal breaker, but when all was said and done, I felt relieved when it ended mostly bc of this.  If we had had kids, they would have been loud and obnoxious, too.

I ended up marrying a very quiet, introspective man."
"Squeezes me really tightly. It makes me feel physically small, which makes me feel sexy. 

Edit: I'm not making some kind of social commentary to say you are only sexy if you are small. I'm saying that *I* feel sexy when I feel small, which has nothing to do with anyone else."
That I really should’ve taken care of my body from a young age. Trying to undo the damage is hard and sometimes not possible. 
10-15k??? I was grateful for the 3k my parents were able to scape together to buy my first car and it was a decent car. My friend just bought a car for 7k and I was shocked he had that much money and blown away by how nice his car was.
"Pretty much everything.  

The big one is the existence of bisexuality.  Trump and the GOP is a big one.

My sister's future is another one too.

Whether physical, and emotional abuse is an effective child-rearing tool"
"My dear husband told me he wanted 4 kids and asked me how many I wanted.

I love him to bits but even after almost 3 years of marriage he still speaks exactly what's on his mind without considering context or how it might sound."
"God, I'm the same way. Every week or so I just have to check in and be like, ""hey are we still good, do you still like me?"" I feel bad about it, but it's what I need to do for now until I get myself more confident!"

I once heard someone scream while I was a freshman in college. I ran to them to see what was wrong. Turns out they didn't know that milk expired and had tried to drink three month old milk. Ew. 
I agree completely. You know those dogs that are all tough behind the fence and when they get loose are super cowardly? I like to think about those types of people like that.  
Low sex drive. Didn’t even know how high mine was until an ex only wanted to have sex once every 2-4 weeks
"Your story made me really sad. I'm so sorry that this happened to you and your sister, and I hope that eventually you can both move on completely from this. Big long-distance hugs for both of you."
"Haha omg! A couple nights ago I walked quietly into the bedroom late at night, boyfriend was sleeping. He thought I was an intruder and immediately leapt out of bed and started staggering towards me like a drunkard, yelling at the top of his lungs ""Hey\-YA HUH HUH HEYAAAAA!!!"" while I stood there screaming in terror. The lights were out and all I could see was this silhouette stumbling towards me and screaming. I honestly thought, well, that's it. Boyfriend's been possessed."

"It’s an extremely long story. But to absolutely compress it, a guy took me to an abandoned home in the mountains, attempted to drug me, and would not return me home unless I got drunk. I had to jump out of a moving vehicle. "
"I work in a pretty male-dominated office. The amount of comments I've heard and the amount of shit I've shot back because I just can't fucking stand listening to it anymore is unreal. I don't think I've changed any of their minds, they just don't talk about it anymore in front of me."
"I support and stand by your decision to leave. Sometimes when my husband and I go out to eat we don't talk much, and sometimes even scroll through our phones during dinner (sometimes together on one phone, most of the time separately, and sometimes he's on his phone while I people watch), and onlookers must feel so sad for us, especially when it's the last one. We're not the couple that sits on the same side of the booth, but on opposite sides, so they must think I'm so lonely lol. 


BUT!  Sometimes we have the most interesting and stimulating conversations out in public, although they usually occur at home while we unwind from work. After 13 years and counting of the best, extremely prolific conversations, debates, etc with my partner, it's OK to do your own thing even if it's in public. 


But your case is different, you don't have years of fresh, new, and exciting conversations in the vault. Fun and adventurous memories, or inside jokes that takes just one word, sound, or phrase to illicit a belly aching laugh from the other. 


I even still watch him sleep (like the loving creep i am), in awe and so madly in love, while he snores like a goddamn banshee which makes me want to smother him with a pillow I get so mad! 



Love is a roller coaster, it has its ups and downs, but the ride should always be exciting and feel like you're in it together. I'm glad you're making the right decision. everyone deserves to be with someone they can have fun with, and that makes them happy in many aspects of life. Good luck to you!"
"I interviewed for a position as a library assistant, and during the interview they passed a sheet of paper with a paragraph and asked me to read it. I did. Then they said ""no, please read it aloud"". Um...okay? I just got my Master's in Library Science, but okay I'm game. So I started reading it. ""okay that's good, we just wanted to confirm that you could read"". Because apparently they get a shitton of people just looking for any job, and most are illiterate. Yikes."
"I really wish I’d spent at least some money. I bought into reddit’s cheapest wedding mentality and my wedding was sad, like /r/Frugal_Jerk sad. Not that I need the biggest wedding ever, but I cheaped out way too much and gave myself way too much unnecessary work. I made my own dress when my sewing skills weren’t up to standard and people thought I was in a Halloween costume. I cried in front of my sewing machine more times than I could count. I didn’t want to spend money on a wedding venue so we did it at a park and everyone ended up walking a few miles to catch a train. I had to apologize over and over to the guests in heels and suits. We spent $300 on food and it was not great at all. We didn't get a real photographer, a friend has a nice camera volunteered to take the photos. We ended up with five photos in focus (well maybe it's a good thing that there's no photographic evidence of how sad the wedding looked) Worst of all my husband actually wanted a nicer wedding but I said no. I feel really bad now for robbing him of the wedding he wanted. We could afford something a lot nicer. I hate traveling, we weren’t looking into buying a house, we have plenty of savings for emergencies. I don’t even know why I was so insistent on saving money. "

We're divorced now. Lol. 
"I know people get nervous and babble, but this was like he'd prepared a list and as soon as we sat down he started rattling them off at me. It includes issues with his parents, his sexual preferences, his history of depression and medications, and a slew of other stuff. Way too personal way too fast."
You may have went on a date with the actual Michael Jackson.^^**HEE**^^HEE
"Their street is privately owned and their HOA, in all its wisdom, decided to remove all the street lights so that people could sleep better, I guess.

As such,  when you're driving to the house, you're focused on what's right ahead in your headlights because the road winds back and forth at random. Add to this the fact that the sign was posted a bit *off* the road in a copse of trees and yeah... somehow I missed it. "
"I'd appreciate the effort, but rather they didn't. Most people suck at writing non-cringy love letters, and I am HORRIBLE at pretending I like something that I think sucks."
I forgot to mention it was winter and there were snow prints that led to under my bedroom window but I was on the second floor. 
"I would say be careful about what you disclose and how you disclose it.

I went on a sort-of date in my late 30s (only the second I’d ever been on) where the guy asked me this question. When I was honest, he got up and walked out. Now, things would have never worked out between us, so there’s that. But it was a pretty crushing experience to have waited decades for a chance to experience dating, and to have the rug pulled out from under me that way.

If I could go back, I think I’d throw in something about “nothing long-term because of moving for university and work,” or something that sounds plausible."
I wish. I filed a police report though. Not that it does very much. 
"There was a woman standing right up to the building edifice, trying to shelter out of the wind, when I showed up early to work. As I was unlocking the door, she asked me for a dollar.

I didn't have a dollar but I gave her all the change I had in my pockets, probably about 75cents. 

I give it to the woman, she looks down at it and *throws* it at my face, shouting ""I SAID A **DOLLAR**!!!"""

"We were at a local bar I love for its low key atmosphere. He got up to go to the bathroom and didn’t come back for like twenty minutes because he was staring at himself the whole time in the mirror that lines the hallway to the bathroom in plain view of  everyone in the bar. 

In all honesty I have no idea how long he actually stared at himself because I left "
I wasn’t even mad at the anti-feminism aspect. The joke was just plain stupid.
"I walked out of work and a man and a little girl approached me saying they just missed the bus and needed a ride home. It was snowing. There were so many red flags but long story short, he stole my phone. He actually had a chance to steal my car and my whole purse but did not. I was able to turn my phone off within minutes so it was just a paperweight (I think, not sure what kind of tricks thieves may have to get a stolen phone to work). I’m thankful for the Find My iPhone app so I could display a message to the scumbag and keep it from being used. Also thankful I backed it up regularly so I had everything saved. I’ll never give a ride to anyone again."
Entertainment budget? Is that even a thing?
That sounds like a horribly designed place. 
"I do not come from a rich family, I'd say middle class. Nobody lives in a mansion neither anyone has much luxury. I am not working at the moment, I can't really spend anything more than groceries and rent. 

Still, some people around me genuinely do not understand how I cannot offer myself a restaurant meal at least once a week. They always plan some sushi nights and yet act surprised when me and my bf have to refuse. 

My point is, people do not need to be super wealthy in order not to understand what it is to be poor. "

I find as long as I tie it up so it's all off my face and neck it's usually fine. I'll just put in some dry shampoo and/or brush it through with water.
My sister lived in New York for a few years. She was on her way to the laundromat when a homeless man asked her for change. She gave him 50 cents that she was going to use for laundry. The guy started following her asking her for more. He kept going on about how she surely has another dollar to spare and how 50 cents wasn't enough. So she asked for her money back. He was confused but she started screaming about how he wasn't happy with what she gave him and she was going to use that money on laundry before she even gave it to him. She made a huge scene. She got the money back.
"&gt; One of my teachers, to scare us into not even thinking about having sex, told us that if sperm even got semi-near the vagina, (like between the legs, the butt etc) that a woman could (and therefore would) get pregnant.

Can I just say how much I love this thread and most of the answers here. I’m not even 25 yet but so afraid of ending up alone and dreading 30s like fire though I know it shouldn’t be the case.
"I'm in my late 20's and Mexican so it's pretty normal to me. I love my parents and get along with them really well. I'm engaged and still get the occasional text from my mom at 11pm asking where I am and when I'm coming home. That is annoying, but that's the worst I can say about the experience so I'm ok with it.

They ask I give them $500 a month so I've been able to save a lot of money thanks to them. I'll be moving out when I get married next year and I'm very much looking forward that next part of my life."

"Just finished my freshman year of college. Girl in my year SWEARS TO GOD her fifteen year old brother has never had a boner “because he would tell me about it!!” Because apparently they tell each other everything. Weird fucking family.
She knows she’s sheltered but she has stated she likes being that way. Being around her is like being around a 10 year old. It’s a babysitting gig. 
She’s also said “What’s a body count? It sounds like you guys are murdering people. I don’t know these things, tell me!” Also she didn’t know about masturbation until college, and feels she has to tell everyone about it. "
"My friend who is 26 years old and seemingly never going to leave home was absolutely HORRIFIED to learn that those of us who have moved out have to do our own housework. I believe her exact words were ""what do you mean you have to vacuum your apartment? Doesn't your mom do that?"". I don't think she's ever done any kind of housework in her entire life. I was like, please call my mom and tell her she needs to come over and clean my apartment for me.

Also, literally every neighbourhood other than the one she lives in/ grew up in is dangerous and scary and full of ""people who drink"". How could I live in such a place?

I love her dearly, but sometimes she makes me want to smack my head into the wall. "
We went to get coffee. We had met online and talked for a week prior to meeting for the first time. He told me he got me a gift. I was kinda excited thinking it might be something romantic. I opened it and it turned out to be three butt plugs varying in size. He then ordered me to go into the Starbucks bathroom and put one of them in. 
I tend to overidealize myself and be way too critical of him.
"Ha! This dude I knew in college didn’t realize you had to take frozen pizza out of the box before heating it. He thought it was like those microwave dinners where you punch holes through the plastic. There wasn’t a fire or anything when he cooked it but the box melted and the plastic semi-melted to the cheese.

He came from a similar background as your friend."
"He just sounds really really really nervous, creepy but kinda cute. "

"Some sexts teach that a baby is a gift from their God, only given to a couple whose marriage He approves of.

"I mean, reddit is right here. Subs with a lot of women, they joke about men. Subs with lot of men frequently have problems with violent statements from male users.

"She doesn’t speak much in her sleep, and when she does about 90% is in Lithuanian or Russian. She did say something once about needing to “catch those horses to take them back to the space station, otherwise the CEO will be angry and if she’s angry...” It stopped there. I should have woken her up. To this day we can’t figure out what it was all about. "
"&gt;My mom's friend sheltered her kids awfully while they were growing up, to the point that the Harry Potter movies scared them \(I guess they could be scary for 6 year olds, but they were 15\), they didn't know who Elvis was, they didn't know what cocaine was, things like that. 

I was very sheltered growing up and was only ever allowed to listen to Christian music. I had never heard Bohemian Rhapsody. I had heard of Beyonce, but didn't even know how to pronounce her name (I had only seen it in writing). This resulted in me going through an emo music phase in college once I had some freedom. "
