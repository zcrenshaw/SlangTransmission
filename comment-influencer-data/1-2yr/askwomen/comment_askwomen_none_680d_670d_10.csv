"Thinking they have to last forever. I went down on one guy who thought he was awesome because he could last forever. 

Guess what, after 25 minutes my knees are sore, my jaw aches, my mouth is dry. I’d much rather a guy who cums quick."
"you say you're close, they start furiously pressing and rubbing your super sensitive clit at supersonic speed and you either scream in agony or go numb.

close means what you're doing is working. speed up or go harder only if asked/you know she likes it!"
"Grew up with a father who didn't give a shit.  He never took the time to get to know me.  My mom started dating my step-dad and about 2 months in they stopped at mcdonalds on their way home to get dinner for everyone.  My mom started to call us to see what we wanted, but my step-dad stopped her because he already knew what we would order.  After 2 months he knew me better than my own father.  It might seem small, but it meant a lot to me.  "
"I'm in politics. A lot of the whole ""House of Cards"" type stuff is super exaggerated. But politicians cheating on their wives and closeted gay male politicians are both pretty rampant and we all know who they are. "
The Halloween where my and my SO showed up in full costume with booze but everyone else was in dressy clothes for a sit down dinner party. 
"If I'm close to cum, keep doing what you're doing, don't speed up or change anything."
"So many things!

-	Lack of healthcare (and insurance companies)
-	Lack of maternity &amp; paternity leave 
-	Gun regulations
-	The war on drugs
-	Military spending
-	Foreign policies
-	Disaster recovery processes
-	TSA"
"Being overly concerned with making me cum - Usually followed by taking way too long.


When the guy asks ""Are you close yet?"" there's no sexy way of saying ""Nah man I got bored a while ago - I'm just here for you at this point."""
"I wanted to, but im nice to a fault.  It was my first stab at online dating.  Chit chatted with this guy a while on plenty o fish.  Shared a few pictures.  He seemed like a catch.  He was a Marine and was now driving a truck, he was hot, we seemed to sort of click.  He kept insisting on meeting.  I wasn't pushing it, we lived like 7 hours apart, very inconvenient.  I told him straight up not to think that because he drove all the way to me that I owed him anything.  He promised he wouldn't, that he just wanted to hang out.  

He gets to my apartment and he was probably the guy in the photo 150 pounds ago.  He was enormous.  Okay, im not superficial, how odd though to misrepresent yourself like that.  I mean, im a chunk but I shared current photos.  He was a super negative person, ""oh you dont like me, ill leave now, stop pretending, im ugly, im a jerk""...It was really annoying.  I was trying to have a nice time with this guy but everything positive I had to say was met with toxic spew from him. 

I had a restaurant in mind, he didn't want to go there.  I mean, OK, I live here, I know the restaurant scene and that place you wanna go to is a dump.  He didn't care.  I wanted to tell him to fuck off right then.  Controlling and dismissive much!?  

We went to the restaurant and he tried getting handsy under the table and complimenting me in a pretty vulgar uncomfortable way.

Bleh, a very uncomfortable awkward dinner.  

He invited himself back to my place and I offered him coffee for his long drive home.  He got kinda mad.  ""My drive home!?  I drove 7 hours to see you!"".  The look on his face was just so obviously, ""if you aren't going to at least fuck me then give me a blow job and let me crash on your couch.""...So I told him im not comfortable with him staying over.  Trying to not seem like im completely disgusted by him I said, ""who knows what that could lead to and im not ready.""...His response was that he was ready and he pulled out a lamb skin condom.  That scared the shit out of me his creepy tone, ""well im ready.""...I told him to leave, he was getting himself worked up, ""I cant believe I drove 7 hours to pay for dinner for some bitch that wont put out.""...He was much larger than me and I wasn't gonna try to really make him mad, so I left.  

I lived in an apartment on the ground floor and I just wooshed by him and flung my door open went outside and waited in the grassy spot between complexes, where there were other people.  

It was 10 minutes before he came outside to leave.  "
"For everyone still complaining about the red pill, MGTOW, or any other sub with similar ideals - /r/incels was not banned for it’s ideals. It was banned for encouraging and glorifying rape and murder. 

If you go to /r/inceltears, a sub that was intended to make fun of /r/incels, you’ll find a pretty decent archive of posts, and it’s alarming how often you find things like quotes suggesting someone find the reddit HQ address and “be a hERo.” The capital ER is a not so subtle reference to Elliot Rodgers, who murdered 6 people for either being a woman who wouldn’t sleep with him or a guy who was sexually active. That subreddit ***idolized him.***

I don’t agree with MGTOW or the red pill or seddit. But /r/incels was seriously next level compared to those guys."
"Don’t speak while a friend is talking to you about something serious, just wait, and when you think you’ve listened long enough to interject, wait some more.

"Sometimes I don't care about a lot of foreplay, but I always want aftercare. Act like you are at least appreciative, don't just roll over, fart and go to sleep."
I don't understand people who propose at weddings without clearing it with the couple first. I think it's incredibly rude. 
"I really don't like any of the jokes that imply the groom's life has now ended because he is ""shackling"" himself to a woman.  "
"Toilet paper in a ziplock bag.  I had an upset stomach and ran into a gas station bathroom, sat down and unleashed hell, and then realized there was no TP.  Luckily I had one of those really long CVS receipts so I.... made do.  

Never again."
Portion sizes are ridiculous
"It was a wedding reception.  There was no food, no booze, and no dancing allowed.  The Bride and Groom took pictures after, and the reception was ~1.5 hours away from where the wedding was so they were like 2-3 hours late. 

If you tried to dance someone from the church materialized and told you to stop or leave.  It was not fun at all.  Had it not been my partner's sister, I would have left too.  So it was sitting in a church's gym on hard plastic chairs for hours, making small talk.  I think I might have been in one of the levels of hell?

Anyway, I told her later it was the worst party I've ever been too and she agreed, saying it sucked and was the worst for her too. "
"I put my coffee maker on my nightstand. It used to take me about an hour of snoozing to get up and go to the kitchen make coffee. I was always late, always in a hurry. Now the alarm rings, I press a button, snooze, when it rings again I have coffee ready to drink on my bed and calmly start my day. I've been chronically late, and it makes me so happy that now I can get to work in time everyday. Might seem silly, but it changed my life, punching the clock in time feels like a small victory every day. And I get t o work in time, I don't keep people waiting anymore, so I think it did make me a better person."
Anyone who schedules a fancy dinner party around Halloween needs to have the stick surgically removed from their ass.
"That Jackie is a pretentious douchebag. When she takes days off, people bring our department cupcakes and starbucks to celebrate. "
"I don’t really think it’s necessary to have the groom go under the bride’s dress in front of everyone to remove the garter that she’s wearing. It just makes me uncomfortable, especially if there are kids that are watching. "
"It was a wedding reception.  They booked the venue before considering how many people they were inviting.  Only half the invited guests could be in the venue at any given time (it was the basement party room of some church after having their wedding at a lovely garden 30 minutes away).  Even with half the guests they were violating fire code, but no one said anything.  Then the bride started throwing a hissy fit because people started leaving before dinner was over (the had a buffet line and the food ran out before everyone had a plate).  Then they used a cheap craigslist DJ whose computer kept overheating and he couldn't even get through a full song before it stopped and by the time his buddy brought a better set up people were gone.  To top it off it was an unseasonably warm day in October and people were sweating through their clothing even outside and it was a bout 20 degrees warmer inside).

It was a disaster. BY the end of the night only the groom had enough to drink to dance and he was alone on the dance floor and the bride was crying in the corner.

Their marriage by all accounts was no better than the party and they were divorced within a year and a half.  Only reason I stayed as long as I did was because my partner at the time was in the wedding party and was trying to be supportive and do damage control. (and a few of us outside ordered pizza to eat on the grass).  Oh and to top it off the bride's sister (maid of honor) kept pulling her boobs from her dress to show off her new boob job (while they were still bruised because she only got them done a few days before).  "
"I grew up in a very monochromatic place. One day it occurred to me that I had never seen an elderly black person, so I asked my mom what they look like. She was confused and said ""they look just like old white people."" So I thought that black people gradually lost their color and turned white eventually. I would see old people and wonder if they used to be black.

It wasn't until I think I was in like 4th grade when it finally dawned on me that she meant that they get wrinkles, not that they lose all of their pigment. "
"Not trying to maintain a steady rhythm when having sex. A lot of men think jackhammering is the way to go, so they go really fast, get tired, and slow down. I'd rather have a steady, albeit slower rhythm."
When I say “Just like that.” And they do the exact opposite. 
"I support the government. It *was* an open secret that one of the guys in the office was asking all the new girls to fuck him. But I reported it, so it's no longer a ""secret"". The open secret now is that old men can sexually harass their coworkers and will be fine because it's difficult to fire people in the government."

"Hard to explain. You’re never sick of that person, hard days are easier because of them, they better you and support your decisions. "
"You’re in love with your best friend. You both prefer to spend time with one another. But you also enjoy spending time apart. You might have arguments over small things but it just shows that you care enough about one another. You might not have the same interests but you try to understand your SO and take part in their interests to make them happy. Making them happy makes you happy. You can tell them anything and not be afraid of judgment. You have inside jokes and make each other laugh. Silence is comfortable, and you feel that you each make one another want to be a better person. You lift each other up instead of tearing each other down. It’s love and friendship and family all in one. You feel real joy, among other emotions; but mostly joy. "

But, overall, I'd say not letting ""perfect"" become the enemy of ""good enough."" If I'm too lazy to do a legit workout, a brisk walk, and 30 pushups spaced out in commercial breaks is better than nothing. Literally anything- physical, chore-wise, health-wise- is better than nothing"
"My aunt used to kiss me on the forehead while I was passed out on the couch. She thinks I'm asleep when she does it but I've caught her a few times.

Along that vein, I knew I had someone in my corner when I was 18, technically homeless and without anyone really, and she called me out of nowhere to say that she was doing up her spare bedroom for me. No questions, just a simple statement that told me I had somewhere to stay if I wanted it."
"Sunny Delight. Drank it all the time as a kid and loved it, then didn't have any for about 10-12 years. Then, when I was working in childcare a few years ago, we had some and I was so excited to have it again...until my first sip. Awful, awful, awful. "
"Everybody really came through for this party. (People aged 19-35). We pooled some money for a small keg. We had cooked food. People brought other snacks and sodas. The condo was really nice. BUT.. the guy who lived there kept awkwardly pulling aside 1-3 people at a time into his bedroom to ask whether this one chick liked him. Does she like me? Has she ever said anything? You think she'd be with me? He got drunk 10x faster than anyone else. He started pressuring that chick to be with him and hinting at violence. Halfway through he started getting depressed and threatening to kill himself until finally he came out of the bedroom, ripped his shirt apart like the fucking Hulk and screamed for everyone to get out. We scrambled out the door with the keg and finished at my place and ended up having a decent night. None of us ever really talked to that guy again. "
"At my building, you can pay $5 to wear jeans on Friday. The money goes to a different charity every month. No one in my department pays the $5..........but we all wear jeans. I know guys. It’s a big one. "
"I know this shows how out-of-touch I am, but I’d have assumed that a subreddit about involuntary celibacy would be a place people go to meet other people who also want to be in a relationship. Kinda like a singles bar.

"She would want kids at some point and I don't ever. It was the right decision. It was an incredibly supportive relationship and I was devastated to end it. But now, 3 years after it ended, the frustrations are easiest to remember. 

Take for example: she *could not* be on time. We would have plans for her to pick me up at a certain time, and she would routinely be .5 - 4 hours later than agreed. After a lot of this I convinced her to keep me updated with an ETA, but she would repeatedly text me a new one right before she was supposed to arrive. So if she was going to get there a noon, i would get a text at 5 to noon, ""I'll be there at 1"", then 5 to 1, ""I'll be there at 2:45"", then another at 2:40, etc. That was the closest thing to punctual she ever got with me, but she could get to a doctor's appointment or the airport on time, no problem. (""But that's an appointment."" ""But we had a date, so I'm the least important thing in your life then?"") No, I'm not exaggerating on the numbers. Drove me bananas."
"I Lemon Law'd a guy once. He misled me about not having kids, which is a 100% no-go for me. So, I politely, and hurriedly, finished my drink, told him that the lying about a dealbreaker is going to make this a non-starter, found the waitress, paid for both of us with a generous tip (didn't want her to get screwed if he left), and left"

"He told me the most intimate thing a woman can do is let him drink her blood and insisted it wasn't a fetish on the second date over dinner. 

He said he was hoping we could get to that point. I NOPED out of there almost immediately by excusing myself to the restroom and not returning, then blocked his number."

"I work in accounting. One of my coworkers is awful at her job....everyone knows it.  Shes constantly acting like she 's stressed and has so much to do. I did her job for 2 months while she was out on medical leave, it's not hard at all. Like seriously, get your shit together lady. "
The way I describe the feeling is that it feels like home. Especially after a few years.
"When I came to the realization that her charm was an act and her friendship was stressing me out more than I was actually enjoying being around her. I don't like to armchair-diagnose but I honestly believe she has traits of narcissistic personality disorder. She's very charismatic when you first meet her and then her toxic behaviours sneak up on you. Lack of empathy, constant bragging and name dropping for attention, manipulating every situation to be about her etc. She was fun to be around in the beginning but in the end I realized that many of her ""good"" qualities were just an act to draw people in. "

"My ex is a great guy. He was so devoted to me, was my absolute best friend. We could tell each other anything and we knew each other so well. He was (and still is), however, extremely negative, clinically depressed (which isn’t a deal breaker but he wouldn’t get help), and completely unmotivated to better his life. I made more money and paid for all the living expenses so he could focus on paying off his debt, but he wouldn’t do it.

I’m not proud of this, but what triggered the end was that I met someone who was almost exactly like him - except he was the man my ex could never be. He was upbeat and driven and all he wanted to do was move up in the world. It made me realize that I was settling for someone who would never try, and I was constantly trying so hard to make things better for him since he didn’t want to do it himself. 

We’ve been broken up for a few months now. I’ve gotten a promotion, made new friends, gone on some dates. I miss him and the safety and comfort that we had, but I know it was the right choice for me to leave."
That is scary. Good thinking to go outside to a public area. What a horrible horrible person
"Of course the stretch marks and boob sag.

The thing I didn’t expect was my periods became a joke after having a child.  They were terrible before and I had to take off work occasionally.  Now I barely notice I have them."
"I had a stalker for 4 months when I started college last year.Right before a lecture (there were like 15 minutes left before it was supposed to start) this guy sat next to me and didn't say a word the first 10 minutes. After that he just briefly asked me something about the last lecture (because he didn't attend it) and that was that. He was quite polite ,nothing weird. After the lecture he asked whether I was interested in seeing him on the weekend and whether I could give him my phone number (even though we had only exchanged 2 sentences ) and I apologized and said I didn't have time to stay there longer because I was hurrying to catch my bus home (which was true,although I was also hesistant to give my number to him because we knew absolutely nothing about each other). In the next few months he would follow me around campus , always attempt to sit next to me during lectures and even changed a course once so he could be with me (I don't even know how he knew which courses I was in) . It all ended by him screaming at me in the hallway at college,telling me I was a wh*re for not accepting his advances ,that I'd never find a guy who is as benevolent and genuine as him and that he hopes that my next boyfriend will treat me so bad that  I realise what a ""fool"" I was for not going out with him. Glad I dodged that bullet."
"Together for 5 years, married for 2 of them. Ultimately it was a roommate situation rather than a relationship. I know I saw some signs early on but I knew that no relationship is perfect. 

In the end, my efforts to make changes—date nights, cooking dinner together, outings with friends—got cancelled. I booked a trip to Seattle and that was cancelled the day before. I felt I tried. I communicated my frustration. Brainstormed ways to fix them together. 

In the beginning we both committed to make it work. But ultimately his own pursuits always won out, be it work or church etc. He always made time for his interests but not ours. Not us. He suggested therapy at the end but I knew it was over for me. 

Like someone else said he’s perfect on paper. My family loved him. They don’t understand even now as I file for divorce. Some friends understand but I think it’s hard to understand if you haven’t experienced it. 

I knew I made the right decision when I found my new apartment and started a new job. I felt the weight of the guilt, the shame, the fear of being alone, the sadness fade. I was happy ALONE. And it was good. I think it was timing but I went from a super extroverted/social butterfly to an introverted, homebody. And I love it. 

Oy went off tangent a bit. Thanks for posting this question. I am glad I could actually write this all out. Now to breathe :)"
"He was my best friend, kind, college educated, smart, never cheated, same politics/religion, cute, my family loved him, and he was never opposed to change when we had a problem. 


Ultimately I ended the relationship because I just wasn't feeling it and I knew something was wrong. I couldn't shake the feeling for a long time that I wasn't satisfied with it -even though he had no major incidences, just minor bumps that he apologized for. 



It wasn't until I broke up with him and got the space that I needed that I was able to see clearly all of the things that I didn't like about the relationship or how I just wasn't getting my needs me. We dated 5 years. "
"Lunchables. I loved building the little pizzas and sandwiches, it was so fun! But the texture of everything was just off...as a kid I ignored it but definitely wouldn't eat one now."
"Other people have listed most of the obvious things, but one that I keep seeing is being really rigid about how sex is ""supposed"" to go.  I see guys on the internet all the time who want to ""mix things up"", but all they really want is a new position or a toy or something.  That's fine and everything, but they're often resistant to making sex less goal oriented or changing the order of operations or doing non-penetrative stuff.  In my opinion, if after all your ""spicing things up"" your sex life could still basically be described as kissing--&gt;foreplay for her--&gt;foreplay for you--&gt;penetration--&gt;orgasm for you (with potential orgasms for her during foreplay and/or penetration) then you haven't ""spiced"" anything.  Lesbians routinely report greater sexual satisfaction than straight women do, and I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that lesbian sex has fewer rules about what has to happen and in what order.

"My childhood best friend's birthday was on Christmas Day, and her parents used to throw her a ""half birthday"" party in June because they felt bad that her birthday was overshadowed by Christmas every year.


Fast forward to me at age 27, a woman I work with is pregnant and her due date is 25th December, she says she feels bad because it's an annoying day for a birthday. I say, ""oh but there's still his half birthday!"" She looked at me blankly like, what's a half birthday? And I realised no, not everyone with a Christmas birthday celebrates in June. My friend's family were really going the extra mile with that.


On the plus side, the woman from work really liked the idea and now does the same for her son every year."
"Toxicity. Immaturity. It was like they never got over high school drama and relationships. Stopped making new memories. Kept dragging me back to the past. Never asked me how I was doing anymore, it was all about them. "

"I don’t understand how anyone could think that their desire to have sex should supersede a woman’s safety or right to choose who she has sex with, and yet if you ever frequented /r/incels, you would see people who read The Handmaiden’s Tale like an instruction manual not a cautionary tale."
Halloween is my mom's favorite holiday so he always goes all out. When I was dating my now husband we lived in the same town as his parents but across the country from mine. One night at his parents house I guess his mom heard me lamenting missing Halloween with my mom. A couple days later I went over and the front yard is filled with a head stone decoration with the name of every member of the family on one. I was looking at them and realized that she had made one with my name on it. Right then I knew that she considered me part of the family and I started to cry. I've got a great mother in law.

She comes to me anyway and asks me and I panic and say 'He's dead, probably.'"
"I just broke up with my partner of 12 years, we are actually in the process of selling our condo. He was my best friend but eventually became like my child. I felt like I was just there to basically run his life. Like another commenter, he has depression that he refuses to treat. His depression issues seem to have become the most pressing thing in our relationship, so I don't get the support I need for my own mental health issues.

We tried therapy, but it just made me realize that even from early in our relationship I had to learn to just tough out my own problems, and that I had been there for him the way he had never been or never would be there for me.

Also, I work overnight and I sleep during the day and when I realized that I was hanging out in bed for hours while I wasn't sleeping just so I didn't have to hang out with him, it was time to make a change."

"I had an ex who thought it was like super important to last forever. He actually lasted way too long, it was like 25+ of just penetration, and then he’d go soft anyway so it was an exercise in futility.

I never brought up that problem with him, I’d had it drilled (ha) in me that that’s something you never talk about. Ugh, it was so unhealthy, sex with him was painful, frustrating, and miserable. 

Of course when I met my husband, during our first time together I made sure he knew that it was **not important** that he last long. Both guys were virgins , so maybe it was my fault for not communicating to the first ex how garbage and painful he was, idk, glad he’s gone regardless."
"It all started with the party the week before.

My friend and I were at a house party of another friend's. It was nice, but one of the guys, a guy I went to college with, was kind of an ass. Started a bunch of political conversations that nobody wanted (UK general election in 2015) and:

1) Brought no drinks, when it was listed as BYOB because ""I'm hosting the next party and there'll be some drinks there""

2) ORDERED A PIZZA LATER ON IN THE NIGHT FOR HIMSELF. And then refused people's money when they asked if they could put another on his order. HE ORDERED A PIZZA TO A PARTY FOR HIMSELF

So naturally we went into the next party kind of hating him. I was already upset at him because of something previously where he'd asked me if I was going to his party and I had said not if X person is going. He insisted on me telling him why I wasn't talking to them (they had sexually assaulted me) and when I told him, he didn't uninvite them, just said ""he said he probably won't"". Thankfully, he didn't but I was still pissed off at him for being so dismissive.

We got there at the time stated, 7pm, maybe a bit later so we had hoped others would be there. NOPE. THERE WERE JUST BABIES. THE FIRST HOUR OF THE PARTY WAS HIM AND HIS NEW NEIGHBOURS' BABIES HANGING AROUND AND CRYING.

So we went to drink outside and avoid the babies until they left.

Then the people started to arrive. Two of the guests were friends but apparently not talking to each other because they both liked a girl and that girl liked one of them back. The guy who had arrived with that girl was trying to stay out of the other guy's business so he didn't start an argument, but the other guy proceeded to get *absolutely demolished* and five minutes into a drinking game, chugged the entire bowl of mixed drinks including sambucca and Wray &amp; Nephews.

Two minutes later, he was blackout drunk and trying to fight everybody. We were trying to get him to calm down and when we had tried to talk him down from hitting someone, he ran across the road and promptly fell skull-first onto the ground.

So that started the whole drama of me going over and doing first aid, touching his head and seeing blood and shouting at the host to call an ambulance. The host refused at first, saying he didn't want his new neighbours judging him by having an ambulance called out. He eventually dismissed this as ""I was so panicked in the moment I forgot what to do!"" the next day when he was trying to claim glory.

So I'm trying to give first aid while tipsy putting a semi-conscious drunk and violent guy into the recovery position while my friend is shouting at the host to tell us his address for the ambulance and getting punched in the tits repeatedly because he's in and out of it and thinks he's being attacked. The host then goes ""oh just move him out of the road so the neighbours can get in"" while I'm screaming at him to stop saying that, we're not moving him. The drunk guy pops into consciousness for a second, hears ""move him"" and LEAPS UP WITH A HEAD INJURY, TRIES TO BE ACCOMMODATING  AND RUNS TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND FALLS OVER AGAIN which is exactly why I didn't want the host to keep saying that.

The ambulance comes while I'm having to restrain him to stop him from drunkenly hitting me while his blood is all over me and he's put into the ambulance. I call his mother, tell her to meet him at the hospital and my friend *dives* on the chance to be the person that goes in the ambulance with him so he can get away from this party.

From what he told me, five minutes into the journey, his heart stopped. He went into cardiac arrest and was resuscitated twice. He was in a coma for nearly a week and had to relearn how to walk.

While we were all at the host's giving statements to the police, the host was apparently VERY angry at the guy that the drunk guy had been mad at all night because he was the first person to call him out on being a piece of shit for trying to stop the ambulance and egging on drama.

So what did he do? Falsely reported him to the police. Claimed that that guy had punched the drunk guy in the head and that's why he'd fallen to the ground. So every person at the party was then called by the police, to which all of us said the same thing ""absolute fucking bullshit, we all saw him make a tit of himself and fall over"" and I told the officer directly that he was making a false report (don't think anything came of that sadly) and the case was dropped. But the host still told the drunk guy's family that, and proceeded to ruin a 5 year long friendship for the sake of drama.

This guy was a solid TEN YEARS OLDER than the rest of us and had a fucking child and was acting like this."

"When people use the argument that something is fine because ""I did/ had... x and am fine"".  It is automatically biased towards the people who are fine and ignores the ones that aren't.  It's a common argument for many things including things that we know for a fact are horrible ""I grew up not using seat belts and survived"" what about the kids that died and seat belts could have saved them?  ""I smoke every day and am fine"" What about the people that have cancer and have died specifically from their smoking habit. ""I played full contact sports as a kid and am fine"" What about the many documented brain injuries and disabilities that have occurred because of those same sports?  

It irks me to no end and I feel like my head will explode when I hear someone say that something should be ok because they made it through ok. "
"Oh a few. 
My old boss was this sweet older lady who decided to open a restaurant at the age of 60 to follow her dreams. I was the first person she hired, and stuck with her through thick and thin. She was/is like family to me. I ended up leaving work to finish college/graduate/got a job in the real world. When I graduated, it had been one month since my mom passed away unexpectedly. My boss got my family together and threw a big graduation dinner with my friends/family for me. 

She also used to leave out 3 vanilla wafers for me every Sunday at work in the shape of mickey mouse. I was a grown adult, but it made me feel special. "

"I did read some of the stuff they used to post, and it made me incredibly sad. There are a lot of lonely individuals out there who do need help, and that sort of community is quite poisonous.

"Fuck incels. I want to burn down their subreddit. They seem like such garbage humans.

They call women ""cum dumpsters"", say they're only ""fuck meat"", complain about the fact that they wear makeup/yoga pants/show cleavage/have slept with other dudes before them/don't pay attention to them/blah blah blah... Yet they're ungodly butthurt and feel like they're entitled to have woman and *they're* in the wrong by us not giving them a chance.

Like yo. Fix your fucking attitude. Because no one, no matter who they are, wants to be even remotely close to someone who has those opinions. Want to know why you're 'forever alone'? Maybe because you're absolute fucking scum."

"I remember a few years ago, women did try to go there and talk. They got shouted down by the men and chased out because it didn't matter what they looked like or acted like *someone* would bang them. I mean... certainly the same is true for those guys, but they apparently refuse to acknowledge options they, themselves, do not find sufficiently bangable. "
"Hen do, and the chief bridesmaid couldn't organise a pissup in a brewery. Firstly, she sent massive invitations to each of us, and didn't pay enough postage, so we had to travel to the postal depot and pay to receive it. 

Before the party started at 3pm she took the bride out for a beauty treatment and we were to meet them at the bride's house. They ran over an hour later than planned and we had to wait outside. Not impressed.

Pre-drinks were fun - butler in the buff, cocktails etc but no food which was to be our downfall.

We went into town, drank more cocktails and half the group decided to leave the bar to go next door and chat up some married men. I went over and told them they were awful hens and got told the chill the fuck out, piss off and no wonder I was still single.  Went back to a miserable hen who was the first of the crying drunk girls. 
More drinking, and I find one of my good friends bawling her eyes out because she'd been sick on her expensive shoes and the doorman wanted to throw her out. We went outside for air to find another girl crying because she can't get a boyfriend and I started to cry remembering the horrible comments I had just received. 

Well I'd had about enough and it was only about 9pm! I used vomit girl as an excuse to take her home via McDonalds, which was honestly the highlight of the night!

Lesson of the night, when drinking, always line your stomach with food, or else there'll be tears."
"I started getting up in the morning a full hour before necessary.  Lingering alone in the mornings leaves me feeling like I own the day.  Conversely, flying out the door by the seat of my pants does not.  At that point, my day owns me."
"Yea, the whole encounter I continued to get the impression that he was weird at best and vulgar/rude at worst, I never really got a threatening vibe until he said, ""*well im ready*"" like I didn't have a choice or something.  So thats when I was like, ""safe space, find a safe space."", outside was all that occurred to me.  We never spoke again.  "
"I knew a guy that he killed, and he was the sweetest most harmless person. Honestly I don't understand how anyone could idolize Rodgers, he was a murderer and killed completely innocent people."

When I was working long shifts at work my co-worker would kindly leave a warm coffee on my desk. It was a small gesture but meant a lot. 
"I have terrible judgement and stay in situations way too long because I don't know how to leave them, but this guy (who wasn't even the worst) just struck out with me. 

Strike one: We had matched on Tinder. He was a chemist, so when I had messaged him asking about his work, he made a joke about being like Walter White, which, okay, cute the one time. Well, when I showed up to the date, the VERY first thing he did was surreptitiously offer me a little baggie of white powder. I was like, ""Hah, this totally isn't meth, it's sugar. Ha ha, I guess...I mean, right? I can't tell if you're kidding."" He was being so shady about it and told me the only way to be sure was to try it. I was like DUDE I'M NOT GONNA INGEST YOUR WEIRD SUGAR THAT COULD TOTALLY BE LACED WITH SOMETHING ELSE EVEN IF THAT SOMETHING ISN'T METH, ALSO, ON THE OFF CHANCE IT'S METH, YEAH NAH. 

I'm ashamed to say I still went inside with him. We all make weird jokes that don't land sometimes, especially when we don't know our audience that well???(???)

Strike 2 was when he admitted, when cornered, that he had lied about his age because he just so happens to ""connect better"" with women ten years his junior (lizlemoneyeroll.gif). Ironically, I was totally fine with his real age and even had his real age included in my age range on Tinder, but I guess he didn't trust younger women enough to give him a chance, so he lied about his age. I told him that was fucked up but still stayed(????)

Then as we made our way further through our round of drinks, he got super creepy and asked me a bunch of times if I had ever been with other women, how much I liked being with other women. I kept politely telling him I didn't know him well enough for him to ask me those kinds of questions, but he continued pushing me to talk about my sexual history in a way that was clearly for his pleasure and nothing else. Finally I said I was done, paid for my own bill (which I always do -- actually, I usually offer to pay for the whole thing, but in this case homeboy had not earned the privilege) and walked out. 

I got pulled over for speeding on the way home and, since I admitted to the cop I had recently been drinking (more recently than I would have normally before getting behind the wheel), he pulled me out for a sobriety test (WHICH I PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS THANK SATAN). I was let off with a warning. It was still a terrifying ordeal and wouldn't have happened if I hadn't been in such a rush to nope the fuck out of that date. 

Like I said, he wasn't even the worst! And yet he is the only one I walked out on. My only regret is not knowing how to walk away sooner (in life in general and on that night in particular.)"
"Him:""Hi.""
Me: ""Hi.""
Him: ""You're pretty.""
Me: ""Thanks you."" *I look off a little awkward and uncomfortable. 
Him: ""I've always wanted to date a little chocolate girl.""
ME: ""Wow.* I walk away, feeling completely grossed out. 
Him: ""Oh sorry! I didn't mean it like that. It's just that you're beautiful for a dark skinned girl.""
Me: Walks away even faster - totally horrified. "
"Spaghettios. I was apeshit for them as a kid - and I only had them at my dad's house. But now, blech! They're disgusting."
"No OP but also in film (on the grunt work side rather than the production/acting/above the line side). Our community recently had an on-set death, an overdose, and a related suicide.  While not related to sexual assault there is an overwhelming feeling of no longer keeping silent about things we see as wrong in our industry. This is coming from crew as well as the various unions that represent us. While a lot of it has been driven by these tragedies I think just as much has been because of the Weinstein revelations- we are all very harshly realizing that this industry will use and abuse everyone it can for the benefit of a handful of rich old white guys. A lot more people are taking mental health days off that they are pressured to skip, refusing to drive drowsy after 16+ hours of work, reporting unequal treatment based on gender and race, refusing to work in unsafe conditions, etc. I hope this momentum continues. "
"Ew. I was invited to a casual Saturday birthday brunch for a coworker. I am not from the South, but apparently, down here, this is the sort of occasion where you put on a nice dress and heels and a string of pearls. I do not own a string of pearls. Also, I was raised by wolves and had no idea it was going to be that sort of party. Any brunch I'd been invited to before was a ""barely nicer than pajamas"" sort of deal. 

A coworker answers the door in her lovely dress, heels, and pearls. I'm standing there in brand-new, but ripped jeans and a sweater. I step in. I am the only one wearing jeans and despite having just gotten them, they weren't even nice looking jeans. (I'm from the midwest, new jeans are practically formal wear.) 

That was the most uncomfortable I've ever been at a party. The hostess even had seating arrangements, with little nametags on each plate. She was really, really into hosting. I had no idea it was going to be like that. The birthday girl in question struck me as a jeans and t-shirt sort of person, so I was just dumbfounded."
"The hostess overheard her husband discussing divorce lawyers with another guy, so the couple decide to have a 'discussion' in their room. Turns out the husband found out that she was having an emotional affair with her ex. Us guests got to hear some of the texts and emails since their room wasn't exactly soundproofed. Someone was nice enough to increase the volume of the music. Me and SO decide to slip out when the hostess ran out of the flat crying and screaming.

This was their housewarming party."
"String cheese.  It used to be so fun and tasty, but somewhere along the line it started tasting like rubber.  

Most breakfast cereals.  How that crap is allowed to be marketed to kids as ""part of a balanced breakfast"" is just beyond me.  It's milk and candy, not breakfast. 

Trix and similar ""kids"" yogurts.  "
"It was not advertised as a fancy dinner party. If it had been, we'd have declined!"
"When I was pregnant, I craved strawberries and creme frappucinos, so I was at Starbucks a lot. I went to a location next to my work one morning, and while I was waiting on my drink order, I noticed an older guy in business clothing looking at me. I'm quite noticeably pregnant, about 7 months. I don't want people to mess with me. I just want my drink. He comes over to me, and says he finds pregnant women sexy. I move over a couple of feet, ignoring him. Then he says, ""the best part is the sex without the risk. You know you can't get pregnant twice!"" I told him to leave me alone, don't speak to me again. He walked away when he felt others look in our direction. I still feel disgusted about this. "
I learned in the last year that cows have to give birth in order to produce milk.  I thought it was just something they did!  I'm 36.
"My friend's husband was killed and I stayed with her for a few days right after it happened. We were up all night, and it was go-go-go during the day... it was a terrible time. After the 3rd or 4th day I needed to go home and eat/change/shower/sleep and she was totally understanding and encouraging of that. As I walked out the door she told me to get some rest and I replied, ""Oh man, I'm going to sleep like the dead."" We both just stopped and I was absolutely horrified by what I had said. She just nodded at me in forgiveness and off I went. 

Stupidstupidstupid!"
"I used to hang out with a bunch of dudes in college, because I was super into video games, RPGs, etc.  So they were all just waxing poetic to eachother about how they don't like girls who wear makeup, because it looks so fake and natural people are way prettier.  And I was like ""Dude, seriously?  Why would you say that?""  Like, did they forget I was here?  And one guy was like ""Well that's what I mean, I think it's great that you don't feel like you need to wear makeup.""  And I'm like ""Wait, do you think my eyelids are naturally green?""

Full face of makeup."
How loud everyone is. People shouting at each other when they are right next to each other. The noise level in bars and restaurants is unreal.
"And then I’m going to throw it to a crowd of drunk single dudes.  

And whoever catches it gets to then slide it on to the leg of the 14-year-old junior bridesmaid because a she caught the bouquet earlier.  

And we’re all gonna watch. "

"Basically I just have a lot of good memories about that eye. He lost his real eye in a concentration camp and used the glass eye for levity when talking about the war or just to amuse people in a general way, and me in particular. When I was a wee girl, he used to bounce me on his knee and pop his eye out to make me laugh or he'd hide it in my pudding or pretend he'd lost it and then make it appear from behind my ear and chide me for hiding it and so on. He left it to me when he died and I've kept it on or near my person ever since."
"My belly is now riddled with stretch marks. (TBH, I think they look kind of cool.)

I have nerve damage on my lower belly because my first kid was so big and pressing on my tummy. If anyone caresses my belly now, I feel some touches in different places, some in normal places, and some not at all.

I have REALLY dry cracking knuckles in the winter. A few years ago, a dermatologist asked me if I had 2 or more kids and I was like, ""Yeaahhhhh..."" She said she sees this only in women with 2+ children. Like, WTH? What a weird thing.

My uterus is not happy with me. I have developed adenomyosis, which is correlated to c-sections and other uterine surgeries (verdict is still out on if it's causal). "
Oh god I got a good one for this. I thought that there were two different famous pop artists named Michael Jackson. One who is white and one who is black. I think I was in high school when I learned that it was actually the same person. 
"I wanted to post something similar but it's about my real dad. I was driving up to see him with my husband and our little one. It was about a 4 hour drive, nothing crazy, but not fun with a 1 year old. We were going to be getting in around 9 pm and when he called for a status he mentioned they had some wine waiting. I asked him if he had vodka and he said ""no"" (which is rare for him) and I quickly said the wine was fine and we'd be there soon. Well, of course when we got there,my dad had a bottle of nice vodka and my favorite mixer waiting for me. As soon as we had hung up, he ran out to the liquor store real quick. I just thought it was really cute. He always does stuff like that. "
"I had my son a little over 3.5 years ago. My feet grew a size and a half, and never went back to their original size. I also have a pooch where my c-section scar is, that is apparently impossible to get rid of, and my hair wants to frizz/halfway curl all the time now, which was NOT its original texture."
"This is such a great example of realizing something you need to change in yourself, and making the accommodation so you can fulfill responsibilities. I know a lot of grown ass adults who ride the ""I've just always had trouble waking up early"" wave and are chronically late or calling in sick, making for sloppy work and pissed off managers and coworkers. Good. For. You. Seriously. Excellent self care. "
"Did you read the article?  *A 4 year old was drinking 1.5 liters per day*.  And the stuff causing the skin coloration was beta carotene. That's the same nutrient that makes carrots and oranges orange, and is one of the primary sources for vitamin A.  There's nothing wrong with the coloring. The kid and her parents were stupid 

They changed the formula when it changed companies and was rebranded as Sunny D instead of Sunny Delight.  That's why is shit now. It's ingredients make it clear that it's just a sugar carrier formulated for shelf life.  It's flavored corn syrup in water, just like every other artificial soft drink.  It's water, corn syrup, and trace stuff like flavorings, stabilizers, and acids.

"""Gender is a social construct"" doesn't mean ""gender doesn't matter."" It doesn't even mean ""gender is not biologically determined.""

All it means is that the way I express my gender, as someone living in the USA, is going to be different than the way that someone in the Philippines expresses their gender.

It is perfectly consistent for trans people to say (and many of them do!) ""My sexual identity assigned at birth is female. My (male) gender identity is biological and was assigned at birth, possibly due to the mix of hormones I was exposed to in the womb. ""

""Gender is a social construct"" =/= ""Gender is just a choice that everyone makes"""
"I’ve started reframing my thoughts. When I want to complain about something, I try to think about it in a positive way. Like, “ugh, I’m stuck in traffic again??” turns into “sucks that I’m stuck in traffic again, but now this gives me more time to listen to podcasts.” It’s made me a lot more appreciative of the little things.

"She ignored me for a week, then messaged me out of the blue to ask if I was mad at her. I was mildly annoyed, but not mad and told her so. We got to talking, and I told her about a crappy experience I'd had that day. She replied by telling me about something that was certainly worse than what had happen to me she experienced and ended it with ""I win."" 

I stared at the message for over an hour not knowing what to say until I realized that I didn't need to say anything. She didn't care about me. She'd used me as a  source of constant validation and sympathy for over a year at that point. I didn't need or want that stress in my life anymore. I promptly blocked and deleted her number out of my phone and just ghosted.

We were best friends for five years. The first three were nothing but love and support for each other, the last two she gradually morphed into this self centered, cruel monster that was furious my suicide attempt and subsequent hospitalization kept me from going on vacation with her. She constantly brought up how I'd ""abandoned her"" when I wasn't allowed to have contact with anyone while in rehab to rub in my face how terrible a friend I am. I still can't figure out what went wrong, or if she'd always been like that and I just didn't see it. "
"Milk. I loved chugging cold milk right out of the jug. So delicious with sweet foods, or with spaghetti. Mmmmmmmm god I loved milk.

"I've heard it called 'security theatre'. They've been tested before and have been shown to have a high percentage failure rate (I think it was ~90%?). On a personal anecdote, I've accidentally forgotten to take things out of my bag when traveling and 'smuggled in' things that weren't approved on their list. 

The problem is, at this point no one can really end the program or even reform it to make it more lax, because no politician wants to be pinned with the sentiment of 'this person is trying to make airports less safe!'."
"Little things that my boyfriend does. I needed an oil change on my car, but I’d also been needing an O2 sensor replaced. I was working nights at the time, and he stayed the night. I went to bed a couple hours before he agreed he’d get up and change my oil for me before going home if I left the keys on my table. When I woke up he’d changed the oil, and left a note in the car saying he also replaced my O2 sensor.

About a week ago I wasn’t able to make it to work on time because my car battery was bad. I got a ride from a coworker and we were about half an hour late. My boyfriend works in a separate shop but close to me. When I didn’t show up on time he knew why. I walked over to him and the first thing he said was “if you give me your key I can fix that when I leave.” He refused to take my money, and the car was running fine by time I finished work.

When I go on a long trip, I’m always greeted when I return with flowers, because he knows I hate flying or driving long distances hurts my back.

"Baths. Not specifically ""girly"", but I always thought the whole bubble bath thing was stupid. You just sit. In water. Dirty water now that you're in it. What's the point? How do you wash your hair? If you shave your legs now you're in dirty hairy water. Do you take a shower afterwards? 

My back has been killing me and my mom told me to try soaking my big-ass bathtub I've never used. I finally gave in and damn near had a religious experience. I'm currently waiting for the twenty bucks worth of bath bombs I bought on Amazon to be delivered."
"Once. Not much to say really. It was our first date and I was still getting to know him. But right off the bat he was so rude to the staff at the restaurant we were at that I was no longer interested in getting to know him. So, I got up and left before our meals even came while he called me fat and said he went out with me out of pity. Which seems off to me considering he's the one who asked me out! "
wow! what an amazing train wreck from start to finish
"When in ireland with a friend, a black guy came over and asked if i wanted to dance, i said thanks but I have a fiancè at home, he left. Then his white friend came over and asked me if I just made that up because he is black, I said no of course not and showed him my engagement ring. He still diddnt believe me and said he understands why I lied and maybe id like to dance with him instead because were both white ?! "
"Losing weight and getting healthier did a wonder for my confidence and self esteem, which positively affected the way that I viewed and treated other women.  When I was stuck in a body that I hated and hated myself, I belittled pretty and beautiful women out of jealousy.  I didn't realize this of course until I became content with myself.  

In no way am I saying that all overweight people are miserable with themselves, but I sure was, and I took it out on other people before I decided to do something about it.  "
Wait what?!
"I worked for a Jackie. People would make bets on when she'd leave for lunch (shopping), when she'd be back. The morale was noticeably better when she wasn't in, everyone's mood went up. Her vacations were vacations for us too. The Friday game was everyone making a pool on when she'd clock out. Closest one to her time wins. I always wondered if she had any idea why everyone would go from desk to desk quietly, I'm sure she watched (it was no secret she had hidden cameras all over the office. But we all knew they had no sound, because if they did, most of us would've been canned for the things we'd say when she was out). "
"Yeah, just once. The guy showed me his junk, mid coffee in a very crowded place."
I loathe the “boys will be boys” statement. Like it’s an excuse to justify poor behavior. I remember my own therapist even said it to me once. “That’s a typical guy thing. That’s what they do.”  Ugh. Having a penis is not an excuse for making bad choices

"when i think about how the culture i live in is different, people are a lot more... trusting? maybe that's the word. while american people are saying things like ''somebody watch my purse while i go to the toilet'', or ''omg you can't let your kids run naked in the beach, pedos could watch!'', i see naked kids all the time in the summer and i just leave my purse and shopping bags at my seat when i go to the toilet. the implicit social contract is ''i trust you to do the right thing''. people sense that they are being trusted and do the right thing. if i ever had my bag stolen i would be legitimately shocked.

i wonder if any of this has to do with the tolerance for violence/mass shootings? like there isn't the trust in people existing, so it's like no amount of horror can surprise people."

"Shit. This post is coming at a really weird time. Me and my dude have been long distance for 4 years, and there is no end in sight. We're both working on our careers, him west coast, me east coast. I love him, but like what others have said, I feel like I am the helper in his life, but he is not who I can turn to for emotional support. Not sure if that says more about me or him. I'm one to be very proactive for people I care about, but when I need someone to lean on, it's not him.

Feck. I'm relating a lot to what is being said here. 

The other small thing I've noticed: we're long distance and I have to keep busy to keep that shit out of my mind. I make plans with friends, go out, have fun. When I tell him about the goings on, it's very clear to me that he would have hated that experience...or probably just put up with it enough for me to be satisfied. He wouldn't actually want to hang with my amazing friends.

I'm thinking we've grown apart with all this time apart..."

"While I was getting my hair done in the morning, the power went out at the salon. The whole block was out. We had to make a mad dash to another salon downtown with sopping wet hair. Luckily I had planned enough extra time that it wasn't a giant deal, but it definitely got the blood pumping. "

One time I was talking to her mom, who thanked me for coming over all the time. I said it's not a big deal, and I understood her daughter couldn't go out because of her autoimmune disease. The mother looked absolutely shocked and said her daughter is perfectly healthy. When I confronted my friend it turned out that wasn't the only thing she had made up for attention... Others included being raped and left out on the street, being bullied at school, and having attempted suicide (she admitted none of this was true)."

Met the guy at the train station (he lives in the burbs). He insisted on kissing me on both cheeks and the man smelled like an ashtray pissed on a brewery. I had one beer with him (while he proceeded to display some ignorance about the basic facts of history) and I excused myself to meet a friend.

"We eloped and scheduled a photographer to capture the day because no one else was going to take pictures. 

The photographer never showed up. 

I called her when we were about to start and she said her car was stolen. She didn't have any contacts for me to call as a back up. I was about to get married to my partner of 8 years, and I wasn't going to have any pictures. 

I literally googled my city + photographer and started calling everyone who popped up. The second or third person referred me to a friend she knew lived close and could do it. This person came within twenty minutes and charged us half the price. Quality wasn't what I was hoping for, but at the end of the day, we got married and have pictures. "

"I'm a teacher, and student teaching was exhausting and terrible. Like I-developed-insomnia-and-a-reoccurring-rash terrible. I was at the doctor one day after school for an unrelated issue, and I was really, really tired and so emotionally zapped out. This was during that part of the doctor appointment where my doctor asks me to confirm most of my basic information and medical history. I know this procedure really well so I can just rattle off my name, age, gender, birthday, current medications, and the answers to several yes/ no questions.


My doctor then asked me the first date of my last menstrual period. I couldn't remember but I knew I was supposed to get my period that day and I hadn't.   I was exhausted, mentally fried, and on autopilot. 


So I said , ""It was supposed to come today but I didn't get it...so get it to me by the end of the week and I'll give you half points. 


I tried to give my period half credit for lateness. At that point, my doctor stopped the basic questionnaire and asked how I was really doing, and we started to deal with that. "

"College party. Massive amount of people 200+. Underage freshman girl shows up with a backpack full of liquor and fixings for lemon drops. Notices me, drags me into the kitchen screeching, proceeds to get people to hold me down after I politely decline, so she can wet my neck with a lemon, pours a container of sugar all over my face and down my shirt, sloppily licks the sugar off me. I get away, smoke with my buds, get sugar out of my eyes and crevices eventually. Crazy freshman girl is tanked, takes off her shirt, chases me down to “do more lemon drops” with her, tries to take off my shirt and pull off my pants. I get away. Things get too wild and this girl won’t leave me and my group alone. We try to leave. She sees us and starts weepily screaming for us to come back, throws her clothing and bottles of liquor at us. She professes her love for one of my buddies, when he declines her advances, she RIPS OUT HER FUCKING INSULIN PUMP and flings it at said buddy. It hits him in the face. She is dangerously drunk and without her pump. Though she is scary and violent, I try to clothe her and convince her to get medical attention. She attacks me, spitting at me and scratching my face, weeping, runs back to the party house. People are freaked out and leaving. Buddy who was assaulted by insulin pump calls campus police, informs party, people scatter quickly. Cops arrive. 200+ people are ticketed for “contributing to the dilenquiency of a minor” for $300. I refute the ticket and don’t have to pay. Girl maintains her love for my buddy throughout the year and stalks him. Breaks into his dorm multiple times. Vandalises his car. Tells people he sexually assaulted her that night (I spent the entire evening with him. He NEVER did anything to her). I, along with many other partygoers, give police statements on his behalf. She eventually tells the truth. He is cleared. Attacks a girl he starts dating. Rips out her insulin pump again and leaves it outside his dorm room door. Is removed from campus never to be seen again. "

"I thought the same thing. I went there a few months back, and quickly learned how wrong I was. I personally blame myself for my lack of a relationship; it was weird seeing them blame all women and the ""alphas"".

"Not during the wedding, but after the wedding if you don't send thank you cards for your gifts. It doesn't have to be that elaborate, just a simple message like:

"" Thank you ______ for coming to our wedding! We're so happy to have had you celebrating with us. The _______ that you gave us will be put to good use (insert how you will use gift). It will remind us of you when we use it.""

So easy to do, and something you can bang out in an afternoon. I've been to a lot of weddings lately, and its pretty rare to get thank you notes afterwords. I think a lot of couples feel weird about it because its not a normal convention to send a thank you card for gifts nowadays and they feel its overly formal or stuffy. But they are SO important because unlike most normal gift situations, you don't open your wedding gifts in front of the person that gave it to you, and you don't have a chance to thank them on the spot. Plus, people usually write nice heartfelt cards and they want to know that you received their gift and you like it and that you read their message. 

I think its pretty tacky not to acknowledge the expensive gift your guest gave you, and all the trouble they took (long travel time, hotels, baby sitters, time off work) to attend your wedding. A little gratitude goes a long way. "

"I’ve been downvoted to hell for this one before, but here it goes again. 


I hate it when people use the words “poor” and “broke” interchangeably. One of my insanely rich friends in college would always complain about being “poor”, when her parents had yet to fill up her bank account for the week. Poverty is way fucking different than not having extra money for luxuries (dinner out, a bag of weed, alcohol, etc. I hate it. You’re not poor. You’re broke. I know it’s irrational, but as someone who grew up below the poverty line and watched my mom struggle daily, hearing people toss around the word flippantly really chaps my ass. "

"The ones that are already infected with that mindset are going to have to find their own way back.  

The ban, and any subsequent bans to like-minded groups, is not to protect or repair those particular people. It is to protect and repair the madly in ""love"" 18 year old who gets turned down next week, and then turns to a group of people for anger and comfort.

That is how these groups ""recruit"" and that is how people are brought into the fold. People who have been hurt and feel that they were wronged.  

A lot of these ideologies work the same way.  Preying on people at their most vulnerable, and telling them that no... They don't have to change, for grow as people, instead everyone else is wrong.

This is part of why the internet is so effective at radicalization.  Isolated people who don't go out and interact with society, and as a result do not have the moderating influence of society to bring them back to reality."

My old company hired a guy, moved him and his family cross country. Rented them a house in a private beach access community. Paid for them to move. And gave him a large salary, big team.

"America has huge tracts of farmland, and most of those farms and ranches are subsidized by the government. The gov't pays these farmers to keep producing food, even when we don't need it - just so that the farmers can make a living wage.

So this means we often have a huge surplus of food that would otherwise go to waste (much of it does). In turn, the dairy and produce sectors lobby the government to push for more consumption of their products. Many kids that grew up in America may remember the ""Food Pyramid"" which told kids they needed to eat massive amounts of grain and dairy, which ultimately was a huge bald-faced lie.

So we've adopted this culture of overconsumption to keep up with our overproduction of subsidized food. And this government subsidation carries up the chain, subsidizing not only the farmers, but also the fast food chains (McDonalds). So the government spends all this money, and everybody lobbies them to keep spending this money, just to keep portion sizes ridiculous.

It's a very strange, politically-reinforced cycle. The smart thing to do is just count calories and not eat everything. Of course, you've also got the mentality drilled in from generations ago (the Great Depression) who forced their kids to always ""clean their plate"" and eat everything, because they grew up in conditions where food was not always available. So they overcompensate and force their kids and grandkids to never throw away food.

Eventually this mentality will likely change, it's just a product of several colliding factors."

"Went on a date with one. He commented how I didn't pay (I had my wallet out when he went ahead and paid, and anyone who knows me at all knows I dislike having other people pay for me), talked about himself the entire time as if he was the greatest thing ever, and had lied about height and posted misleading photos on the dating site. I don't mind dating someone shorter than me, but don't lie about it because when I come and I'm 5'7"" and you're supposedly 5'9"" and yet shorter than I am...it's kind of obvious you either feel you have to lie to get dates or you lack confidence enough to own your height. 

We had talked so well online for a few weeks so it was a big let down in person to find him to be someone who would talk over me and be such a braggart. When I went to rotations (aka working for free but getting grades so can't always have the phone) the next day and didn't immediately answer his texts, he freaked out and left a bunch of text messages about how I was ghosting him and he's a nice guy and how dare I not answer. 

I responded back by saying ""hey I'm in work/student mode right now but what you just did was enough to make me decide to not go on any further dates."" He apologized and left me alone after that. 

He wouldn't be an incel or anything. He did seem nice enough. But damn they turn on you so quickly! "
"I should have. I really wanted to. The restaurant was really small and the bathroom was near the back so I couldn't pull the old ""never come back from the washroom."" maneuver. It was by far the worst date of my life. He had an incredibly negative personality. He complained non stop about everything. He told me about how he had been fired from literally every single job he ever held. He launched into stories about each job and what assholes his employers were. He had excuses and basically ever single story ended in him intentionally breaking rules or going off on a boss and subsequently getting fired. He complained about his family, complained about the area we live in, literally everything. His personality was just such that he disliked everything and was weirdly proud about it. Look a date is basically a preview to the movie of your life. The goal is to advertise to someone how awesome your life is with the hopes that they want to become apart of it. Couple that with a meaningful connection through shared interest or interesting conversations. This guy seemed completely clueless about that and showed very little interest in my life or getting to know me. 
He also did that really annoying thing some guys do where they make fun of the girl for something and then assure her that they still find her cute. It's a cheap move and I wasn't intimidated as I didn't give a rats ass about his opinion of me. He also went into detail about how he was recently single and brought up his ex multiple times.

"IME, the problem can be that you're so used to understanding another person's POV that you don't notice your own feelings in real-time, so by the time they catch up with you, you don't know why they're there or what they mean, so it's harder to validate. You're like, ""I'm angry because.....why?...."" This happens to me a lot. I feel a thing but I can't for the life of me work out why I feel that way or what has caused it. It's a lot harder to validate if you don't have a story for the emotion.

Trick for me has been trying to tune into my own body a lot more during the day and notice how I feel about different things as they happen, so that I've got a good sense of my own POV."
"For the record, Jackie was the office manager. She was mocked because of how unpleasant she was. I'm talking the kind of woman who argues with you about YOUR feelings on something and tells you how you feel. She was the boss who would make you wait when you put in time off requests for open time, decide she wants that time, and then deny your request, every time. She was materialistic and EVERY conversation she'd have with you, she had to drop a hefty price tag to remind you how much she has. She would talk over anybody. She spent her days berating employees (she made one guy cry regularly). One colleague put in their notice, and her first words were ""oh, I'm so glad. We've been trying to get you out for 6 months so it's good you're doing it for us!""

"It's not precisely advice, it's more of a perspective, but it's one I find myself referencing to other people often, and it made a pretty important impression on me at the time it was communicated.

I wasn't allowed to watch R-rated movies when I was a kid, but at age 11 I was handed a pile of my parents' fantasy novels to read after I complained about being bored.  After encountering a few sex scenes that were, in the scheme of things, pretty tame, but certainly more explicit than anything I'd thus far consumed other than in sex ed books, I sheepishly went to my mom and asked if she remembered that they were there, and if it was really okay with her that I was reading those things.  

Her response was that she didn't let me watch movies for adults because of the graphic violence, not the nudity or sex scenes.  Because ""sex can be a good, healthy way of interacting with other people, but violence isn't.""  (When I later compared notes with my friends on the matter, their media restrictions were overwhelmingly on sexual content rather than violence, and they were rather in awe that my parents didn't care if I saw sex scenes.)

I really appreciate that she felt that way and that she explained it to me when I asked, because it certainly helped set me up to enter adulthood with fewer hangups about sex than most of my Southern-raised peers."

"**I always felt relieved when I left her presence.** 

It was absolutely the right decision. When I believed the grass would be greener with someone else, I was 100% correct. 

I am now married to a fantastic person who makes even the most unpleasant, dreary, stupid, annoying, repetitive tasks better. Just by being who he is. I would rather clean a litter box with my spouse than go to an amusement park with my ex-girlfriend. And it's not dreamy infatuation -- I've helped my husband go to the bathroom and wipe his ass when he was terribly ill (and then he had to go to the hospital). I felt better with him than I had with my ex *even then*. 

But I would have left my ex even if I expected to never find anyone else ever again. No relationship is still greener grass than an exhausting one.

It did make me sad since she was a good woman, and perfect on paper. I still admire her tremendously, and she thinks well of me too. But we could just never, ever relax together. "

"I've posted this before, but I went on a date with a dude whose best friend was in prison for assaulting my best friend. He recognized me from social media, but I had no clue who I was until I showed up and he told me, and let me know that was was wearing his incarcerated best friend's jacket. It was horrifying, and I was like okay, I'm leaving, this is really messed up, and he was SHOCKED. He told me that I should have been happy that he was honest with me, and that ""there are two sides to every story"" and he had brought me WINE and why was I being like this? "

"When anyone tells me that I'm even more beautiful now that I'm pregnant, or that being pregnant is the most womanly a woman can get.

"So I don’t really play online games like MOBAs anymore after some bad experiences. Basically if people found out I was a girl, one of three things often happened:

- one or more of my team would spend the whole game around me ‘protecting’ me like I was done high value target
- some guys would just hang round me in the game like a weird form of flirting. Like I’d want to either date them or sleep with them.
- If the other team found out I was a girl, some of them would stalk me for easy kills. 

Plus, if we lost it tended to be my fault! There were occasions where people would be like “she’s a girl.....cool” and play on. But what I described above happened enough to be annoying and off-putting."

I took it at face value at first and said something like: ""Maybe my bag pushed against it or something, I'm sorry. But I didn't touch you."" But then he kept making a big thing out of it, kinda drawing attention to us, and then kind of...started trying to use it to flirt with me. ""can't keep your hands off it, can you? Go on have another go."" Etc. And that's when I realised it was some kind of ploy. 

I was so confused, and then so embarrassed, because everyone was looking.

When I came home two days later, I had a package. It was a framed picture of my hamster, with the sweetest card ever, packaged in chocolate and paper streamers (which I love) and tiny cookies (kruidnoten). I was bawling my eyes out all over again. 

I think that's the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me."

"Yeah. He seemed like a nice guy online, but when we met in person I instantly just had this bad feeling about him. Idk something about the arrogance in his walk. Anyway we went to a bar and had a drink and he was so rude to the wait staff. He also only talked about himself. But what made me walk out, rather than wait for the dates natural conclusion, was when he got my name wrong for a second time! And he wasn’t even close. He just called me a completely different girls name!"

I am happy I made that decision. I hope he finds someone who will love him like he deserves. He's amazing. "

"I'm really hard to get off, which my ex knew, and eventually he stopped trying. He stopped checking in with me to see how I was enjoying myself - it just sort of all became about him after awhile. So I'd say pay attention to her as if you want to make her orgasm, but if she tells you it's not going to happen or if she initiates moving on to something else, let it happen. 

Or talk to her and see how she feels about the whole thing. I didn't like the pressure to feel like I had to get off every time, but it was really frustrating and hurtful when my ex stopped trying at all."
"The one that infuriates me the most is ""I was spanked as a kid and I turned out fine."" Mainly because people say this as a damn justification to spank children. 

Well I did not turn out fine. Yeah, I'm *doing* fine now, but guess how my relationship with my mom is? Guess how much fear and anxiety I experienced during childhood? Why would you think that's ok to put a child through?"
30 minutes before my reception started my bartender left to “get more ice” she didn’t show back up until 45 minutes after the reception had started.

"We were together just shy of 9 years. We met at 13 and quickly became best friends and everyone always asked if we were dating. Then at 14, being young and dumb, I realized that I loved him. 

After that you would rarely see us apart. We were a package deal and everyone knew that. We got engaged right out of high school. Everyone just expected we would get married, have a bunch of little versions of us running around, and end up grey together. Things weren't awful all the time. I frequently just felt like how I was feeling didn't matter. We were essentially living like best friends with benefits and I just wasn't genuinely happy. The main reason I was staying was because I didn't want to hurt him.

But then some lovely redditor told me the wise words, ""You don't owe anyone shit."" And I swear I saw a motherfucking light bulb go off. My life is mine alone and I need to be enjoying it. Anyone who wants to get in the way of my happiness can kindly go fuck themselves. That night I talked to him and broke things off. I know it sounds cliché but it was like a weight was lifted. I felt like I could finally breathe after feeling like I was drowning for so long. I just didn't realize at the time that he was the ocean sinking me. 

TLDR; 9 years of best friends better off that way. Moral of the story - Fuck dementors."
oh my god this made me genuinely laugh out loud 
"I've experienced shit like this... but so much worst. 

We met on Tinder. He's from France, I'm from the Philippines. We matched when he was visiting and he messaged me when he got back in France. We talked everyday for 2 weeks. I gotta tell you, I liked him at first because he was so nice until he fucked up... 

It was when we were talking about sex. He asked how many guys I've slept with. I answered ""4"". Then I asked him... He answered ""1"". I felt that he didnt like my answer because I slept with more people than he did and ofcourse I cant do anything about it. 

He started giving me cold shoulder, he even deleted me on Facebook then I asked him why? What did I do wrong? Did I say something? He was like ""I'm sorry I know you're a nice girl but I couldnt be with someone who sleeps around"". I got offended but I just shrugged it off and said ""Ah yeah? Okay. It was nice talking to you""

After 2-3 weeks, I received a message from him. He was saying sorry. He wanted to make it up to me. I told him ""I'm sorry. You judged too quickly. Let's not waste each other's time."" Then he kept bugging me everyday.. I'm not really an asshole ya know? So I told him ""You know what, I cant promise you anything. If you want we could be friends but please dont expect anything from me."". Then we became friends lol

After a month of being ""online friends"" I got a message from him saying he booked a flight to Manila and he was so excited to see me. I was like wtf is he thinking?? I never asked him to come visit. I asked him why is he coming to Manila he answered ""I wanna spend time with you."" Aughhh so the main purpose of his visit was to see me. 

And then he arrived. Im telling you, that was the worst days of my life. He was clingy af its so annoying. There was a time that he threw things beside me (thank god not at me) because he got frustrated when he asked me would I ever cheat on him. I answered him ""yeah no maybe"" then he turned beast mode on. He kept yelling ""I travelled half the earth for you and this is what you're doing to me? You are a bad person"" 

Im. Not. A. Bad. Person. I made things clear at the very beginning that dont expect something from me....

"Got sexually assaulted by a guy I thought of as a close friend when I was coming out of the bathroom to rejoin the party. He'd been waiting outside the door, kissed me when I opened it, and pushed me back into the room and tried to close the door. I pushed him away and said no, and he tried again. 

I got away from him and asked another male friend to keep an eye on me. He used the opportunity to invite me to a threesome with him and his new girlfriend. Decided to leave and the first guy followed me out to my car and pinned me to the hood. I talked my way out of it by persuading him that I actually was interested and just wanted to date him first, and I'd give him a call later.

When I told the friend who hosted the party what happened, he kind of shrugged it off, and kept inviting me to parties there with these other guys... obviously I quit attending. He couldn't understand why I never hung out with him anymore."

"My parents hated him. We started dating in high school, and my mom would literally glare at him when he was around. He wasn't invited to anything with the family. My parents would ban me from using the phone to talk to him. 

We are married now and my mom sends him care packages in the mail and asks him to go to brunch. My dad asks him to go play pool. I think they like him more than they like me."
"Oh my gosh this happened to me once. My coworker has two other roommates and he said they were all having people over for a party. When I got there, it was just me and my coworker and we just sat there. One roommate only just walked by and said ""Hi,"" the other wasn't around.

That was when I finally realized it was a set-up and that everyone was right when they said he had a huge crush on me..."
"My sister’s new cat likes kneading a lot. Like a lot. 
One time I woke up in the middle of a hot night (I was sleeping topless) because I felt her tiny claws kneading my boob. And when I looked she was sucking on my nipple trying to drink milk. 

That was very freaking weird. 
She’s done it to my sister too. "
"I just turned 56. I thought I had it all together in my late 30s--had a great job that paid EXTREMELY well, just bought a great house, had a great marriage, a great kid, blah blah blah. Then Stuff happened, and a lot of that went away (save the marriage and kid), and I had to start all over again. Then more Stuff happened, and I had to start all over AGAIN (though kept the marriage and kid then, too). I'm now like five steps back from where I was at my peak, but I'm also about five steps ahead of where I was at my lowest. 

So, yeah. Life is constant hurdles, many of which just sort of come at you out of nowhere. Probably for almost everyone. I think the secret is to just keep trying to leap over them when you can. And if one or two make you flail wildly and land on your ass, then you just pick yourself up again, slap a Band-Aid on whatever scrapes you can, and keep running. "

"I've been in two ends of the relationship spectrum. I was in an abusive relationship for three years with a manipulative, toxic person. I was young when we were together and it was during very formative relationship building years. There was nothing fulfilling about that relationship and when we broke up I felt like a new person. 

I am now engaged to a wonderful man and we have been together for almost eight years. I had a lot of emotional baggage and he was (still is) very patient with me. I like him as a person and truly enjoy his company. If things were different and we were never romantically involved I would want to be his friend. I did not feel that way about my ex. We make each other laugh and we dance alone in our underwear and we have fun doing the most mundane tasks. I tell him things I could never tell my ex without risking a three hour fight. I like him and I love him and I think that's what it's like to be in a fulfilling relationship. "
"Getting hit on when I'm on a bike is often extra funny, because I think guys who just *cannot* let a woman pass them without making some sort of comment are now under pressure to do it quickly before the light changes and I get out of earshot.

I told him that my bike was in fact my bike, and he goes, ""You gonna have sex with it later?"""

"I have lived my entire life in a very rural part of southern Mississippi, and the answer is both yes and no.

There are a lot of small, rural towns that can be difficult to get into/out of because there aren't many roads or because the roads are twisty country roads that go for miles through empty woods or fields and it's easy to get lost, and in an emergency situation those roads would quickly get clogged up with everyone trying to evacuate on roads that aren't designed to handle that much traffic. The USA is a big country with lots of empty space, so even if you can escape from your town, there just may not be anywhere to go or time to get there.

"This is the dumbest thing ever, but I went through a two month period where everything I did for my friends went by unnoticed. I bought my friend a water bottle when I noticed hers was broken.

Then my best friend took me out for dinner on my birthday, insisted on paying, and before she turned on the engine and before I even had the chance to thank her for taking me out, she turns to me and goes “thank you so much for spending your day with me.”

Also, for every 5 of them cheating on their wives, at least once is probably having an affair with another man?

How close am I?
"
"By text, while I was on the train to meet him for a show I was kinda excited about, which he had the tickets for. He told me to go back home."
It’s ok to get rid of them. No need to keep useless items in your house just because you got them as a gift. 
swim wear problems.
"On my old account, I was posting on the depression sub about my eating disorder and some guy messaged me and said that I need to find a good man that makes me wanna stay thick.

Like no. Dude. "
"yep. Adding to this, but probably less of an issue despite reddit's rules against brigading- they *constantly* linked to comments and threads in other subreddits and flooded in to mob attack the ""chad"" or ""femoid"" who was their ire of the moment. Gods know we would deal with them here like mosquitos at a 4th of July Bayou picnic. "
"The one incel I met was my rapist, as well. Truly sorry this happened to you. I have moved on in a sense where I don't have nightmares all the time but I hope he gets run over by a god damn bus. "
"I've not gamed online for several years but I found the online community split between guys who want to buddy up with you cos they think it's cool you're a female gamer, and guys who target and stalk you in game because they think you are an easy kill, which in my case is sadly true. I only game cooperatively online now."
"&gt; He wasn't willing to make me an omelette when I was recovering from surgery

I know people have different needs and expectations in relationships, but for me, that kind of thing is fundamental. If I can't rely on my partner to take care of me when I'm down, we're really just roomate fuckbuddies."
I have some hope that this trend of calling out sexual assault and harassment continues and in other career fields and the perpetrators are held responsible.
"That we're equal to men and shouldn't take no shit from anyone, male or female."
Being able to see all sides to a situation doesn't mean that my personal feelings and experiences aren't valid. I know what I think and feel and that my perspective is as valid as anyone else's. 
"I really link this to an overreaction to the Great Depression.  The hyperbole was literally ""A chicken in every pot"" at one point, it basically became fact through time."
"Yep! I used to work for the federal government and was sexually harassed by someone there. He also harassed a number of women, even went as far to stalk one of the women at her own home!Yet, he still works there. Even to this day. I left this job six years ago, I can’t imagine what he’s been up to.

It’s *possible* to fire people like him, but it involves massive amounts of paperwork, repeated warnings, etc. ridiculous. How do you warn someone to “not stalk someone at their home again?” And make sure they follow through? Ugh. 😑"
"When another friend called me up, crying, because the other girl had freaked out at her for cancelling plans...when she had the flu..."
"I've done it, many times. 


I've also heard time and time and time and time again that men don't often like it when women make the first move. I've seen so many guys call women desperate or thirsty or clingy or easy if she pursues them. Talk about women I know as crazy because she made the first move. A lot of these dudes also say they wish more women would make the first move... but probably only consider a few specific women they want to pursue themselves anyways. 

I've had men tell me if they were interested, they would have let me know and that it's pathetic and sad to be throwing myself at dudes. 


So that kind of puts a dampener on things. "
"This one is so absurd, I just love it"
"- Sex from behind feels completely different. Much more difficult for my husband to penetrate, the angles feel weird, often painful

- Still cannot do 3 consecutive jumping jacks without peeing a bit"
It's a federal jobs program that also happens to buy ludicrously expensive equipment from politician-owned vendors. I still can't believe there's no conflict of interest when it comes to the government buying/contracting from companies owned by politicians.
The word cunt. I’ve been desensitized and have been known to use it myself in traffic. I love all my curse words equally.
"I get what you're saying but I disagree. 

I struggle with depression and anxiety and my all of my friends and family know about it. They try to help when they can but they have their own lives and problems that they have to deal with. My problems aren't their problems. 

Other people helping you with your problems will always be considered a kind gesture because they don't have to. "
"My lips are naturally very red. Whenever I wear nude lipstick and make my lips lighter, guys always comment that they ""look better naturally"" and I should stop wearing so much lipstick. I've also been told to stop wearing fake eyelashes, because my eyelashes are black even though I'm blonde, so they must be fake. Quite a lot of guys have said that the dark circles under my eyes are ugly and strange, because no other girls have them. Not one of them believed me when I said most girls have them, they just cover it with make up."
"How anyone could possibly view universal healthcare as a bad thing

And,to a lesser extent, lack of parental leave (though that i can sort understand because the vast majority of voters are likely not going to benefit from the parental leave so the group that would bring it in would likely not benefit from it)"
"This was something my mother really made sure to talk about when I was growing up. 

So when it came time for wedding presents, I'd only allow myself to open a gift if I had my thank you card and pen at the ready, and I could only open another one if the previous card had been written, addressed, and stamped. It went pretty quickly overall, and made it a less massive task!"
"What?!?  Do you mean having sex or “fucking him over”? 

*Please be the latter*"
"Fine by me, I never want to marry either. My SO and I have been together 17 years and we're doing ok. Both of us are pretty against the whole institution of marriage."
"When kids say something about your appearance either good or bad. They’re kids, they’re not supposed to have a good filter yet. "
"This is what I hate about people like that. They don't make advances, they don't even try to do *anything* and then they expect other people to put all the effort into the things they want (friends, relationships, etc). And then when that method fails (obviously) they get mad, think the world is unfair, think they're ugly, other people are shallow, etc. Sorry that you had to cross paths with a delusional creep. "
"Hide it on your pudding? Creepy as balls, holy shit 😂"
"I didn't know that it was a date.

Basically my friend invited me to a night out. Over the next hour or so I'm picking up on some weird cues. This guy shows up and he's being real friendly towards me specifically. Then I put it all together and I realized that I was his date. I confronted my friend and found out she had invited me with the intention that I was a 'cute girl' for her male friend to hang out with that night, because he spent money on everyone if he had a chick to hang on during the night. 

Basically I was arm candy so they could all take advantage of the guy. 

Did I mention I had a boyfriend at the time too??

So I excused myself, saying I had to be at work early. It wasn't a lie. But the guy follows me and is apologizing profusely for not being a good date and begging me to stay. I was mortified. I didn't know how to tell him that his friends were all crap. I just stuck with my comment that I had to work early and I needed to get home. Guy looked devastated but I'm not going to be loaned out just so other girls can get a few free drinks. 

(And no, I am no longer friends with any of these people.)"
"Mountain Dew. Most soda in general, but Mountain Dew specifically. And this was after constantly refilling my 60oz (yes) mug every week with Mountain Dew for *years*, at least since 5th grade (it severely fucked up my teeth, I do not recommend that).

I remember my freshman year of college, it was almost never in stock at the dorm commissary so I only rarely bought it. About halfway through the year, I managed to score two cans, brought them back up to my room, cracked one open and had a sip... and it was like a switch had flipped in my brain. It tasted the same and yet 'same' suddenly tasted gross to me. It was like drinking morning breath. I set the van down, kinda shook my head, said to myself, ""you know, I really don't like this anymore,"" and ever since I have never had a single craving for soda. I mean, I'll drink it sometimes, sure but the addiction is 100% shattered. "
You should have mozzarella sticks every year on your anniversary to memorialize the mozzarella sticks that never were. 
Nothing. Crushes happen and they will pass.
"People who make that kind of joke are often unhappy about their own marriage or relationship. But if you have the right partner, it is never a problem to settle down. Let them make that joke, you can then start betting on how long his relationship will last."
"I get what you're saying and I agree it's rude to judge people's weddings to their face or even to other mutual people you know, but at the same time this is an anonymous thread about people's opinions... And I like having an outlet where I can air my opinions, judgy or not. If that makes sense :) "
"""I bet you wouldn't tell me no if I had a gun to your head.""

Lots of trash talking my partner(s) for not being right there with me at that moment. 

""You look like a girl who puts up a fight.""

"In the movie industry these types are known as “personality actors” because their primary talent is to be their charismatic selves. 

Famous examples: Harrison Ford, Seth Rogen, Jack Nicholson. "
"Is it possible that he's closeted and the man he tells you is his brother is actually his boyfriend and he thinks is he's come up with the ""perfect"" cover for a man to be living with him? Even though it's clear they're dating and he's not as good at lying as he thinks he is?"
"When she got sick of their dog, so she got her husband, 2 kids and dog on the car, drove to the mountains and dropped the dog off. That would have been enough, but the topped the shit cake by telling me how the adults laughed at the dog chasing them and kids crying.

Ugh you can't imagine the hate I feel just remembering this... I can't get over the mental image of their sweet dog being left behind 😢"
"Is the C word just deemed more offensive in general there, or is it that it's perceived to have something specifically to do with women? In the UK you'd more often level that word at a man than a woman, although you could say it to either really but it's not gender specific. In America, is it targeted at women or have I misunderstood that?"
"Previous job. One of the supervisors, Imogen, and a coworker of mine named Anastasia shared a house. Imogen, her husband, and their kids were on one floor, while Anastasia and her husband and kids were on the other. They were bestest buddies and it looked like it was all working out. 

Then, one day I get into work and the air is tense as fuck. One of my coworkers told me that, over what appears to have been a weekend, Anastasia hooked up with Imogen’s husband and Imogen started getting her fuck on with another supervisor on our shift, call him Bruno. 

Imogen and Bruno tried to keep it quiet, but Anastasia laid it all out there, so everyone knew. It was especially irritating because Imogen was my supervisor, but she would wander over to Bruno’s to flirt with him, usually when people in my section fucking needed her. Anastasia and Imogen stopped talking to each other as well.

My shift once got Chinese food and did the stupid “in bed” game with the fortune cookies. Bruno made a joke along the lines of “huh, funny. This one just says ‘you are great.’” Cue Imogen tittering at him while the rest of us sat in stony, blank-faced silence. "
"Because people treat you differently based on what you identify as.

Tons of things are social constructs. Money. Timekeeping. Countries. The law. Capitalism.

No one pretends these don't matter. "
"I'm a data scientist. As a kid I preferred animals to people and that extended to my toys - lots of model horses, stuffed animals, littlest petshop, etc.

My favorite thing to do was read, though. I spent more time reading books than I did playing outside or with my toys. 

The thing I did as a kid that I think pointed toward what I do now really is that I liked organizing things. Even as a young child I alphabetized my books, sorted my marbles by color, type and size, always sorted my Halloween candy by type, etc. I liked making lists, too. It's not really shocking I wound up liking databases as an adult."
"Gave birth three years ago. Pregnant again now so not sure which of these are permanent but...

got a few stretch marks on my lower belly. Not too noticeable but they’re there. 

I developed a taste for butter.

My cupsize went from an A to a B. "
"I don't think I'd say biggest, but in my first semester of college I kind of just ignored my classes. I can NOT understand why I thought that was a remotely OK plan of action, or how I could have possibly thought the outcome would be anything other than horrible.

In the end I was able to semi-salvage my GPA and am now a PhD student but I do think that I shut myself off to a lot of opportunities through that stupidity. "
"They're all shitty, but the train one would've scared the hell out of me. "
"Got verbally invited over to a friend's house for a Halloween party. All halloween parties up until this point had been costumed. We showed up in costume, with bottles of booze and beers. Everyone in the house was wearing normal clothes. Dining room table was decked out ala Martha Stewart. "
"When they say ""I'm coming"" please do not speed up (unless told to). It isn't the last lap of a Mario Kart race! 

Also, the clitoris doesn't need to be pressed down on super hard for arousal to occur. Once upon a time a guy was moving his fingers so fast and hard across mine I thought he was trying to set my crotch on fire.

Good things come from talking with your partner about sex stuffs!! "
"As an American, I also have problems with this one. "
Every time I read on /r/frugal about someone throwing a big wedding for &lt;$5000 I picture this exact situation. 
"The idea that you can ""reform"" the serial cheater/womanizer. "
"I think that goes both ways too. Planning a wedding is expensive and stressful, and any little perceived irritation and everyone is quick to shriek that you're being a ""zilla."""
"I went from 267 lbs to 119. The difference in how I feel and how much more full my life is makes me never want to go back. I’m able to do things I’ve never done before. I’m active, I travel, I date, daily activities aren’t hard anymore, I’m not in pain like I used to be. I thought I was healthy because my blood work was normal, no blood pressure issues, no medications.. but damn was I wrong. Stupid little things like just being able to stand right up after squatting down to do something feel like a miracle. Every single day I think to myself how fucking happy I did this and how I should have never let it get that far in the first place. "
"I was working contract and they made me an offer to go permanent full time after a year. The salary was low. So I looked up a salary survey for my career field and found an average salary number for a person with my skills and experience. I took that data and presented it to my hiring person. I stated all the things I'd done over the last year, all the times I went above and beyond, all the performance marks I'd hit and surpassed, my attendance record. Then I said I'd love to accept the position if the salary could be raised to meet the average for my position, value, and experience. They deliberated for a day and came back with a higher figure. I accepted."
"Did you delete and repost?

Incessantly pestering for anal. Not a good tactic."
"I'm surprised at the amount of comments saying it's unimportant. 

I absolutely find it important. When I'm proposed to, I want it to be meaningful. I don't want anything elaborate and I *definitely* don't want a public proposal, but if he hasn't put some amount of planning into it, I would be disappointed. That being said, it wouldn't affect my answer."
"It's not tacky, per se, but I really hate fancy rehearsal dinners. Why do I have to get dressed up and make awkward small talk with people the day before I have to get dressed up and make awkward small talk with people?"
"I did. It was when I was recovering from surgery for a month at my parent's house. My SO, who I was living with, would not come by to spend time with me. My coworker, who was the one who rushed me to the ER where I then had surgery, came by every day after work to just sit and watch TV with me so I wouldn't be lonely. We would text constantly. He was also having an emotional affair, because he was married. I felt terrible about that, but was in such a bad place I let myself fall into something that I never thought I was capable of doing. I didn't feel so bad about betraying my SO, because he was honestly terrible to me. I broke up with him, and told him what had been going on, but he knew the reason I ended it was because of how he had been treating me. I don't know what happened with the other guy and his wife, I do know that he told his wife. I left that job and never talked to him again. I have a lot of guilt over it, but have talked it out a lot with my psychiatrist to understand better how something like that could occur. I know I'd never do something like that again. "
Blankets/throws. You can never have too many cozy couch blankets. 
Yeah.... that'll do it.
