"I lost my student card the last year of university. Paid 50$ and got a new one. But they put the expiry date as 4 years from the day I got the new one. 

Student cards doubled as bus passes so long as the card was valid.

I didn't correct the card and used it as a bus pass for 2 more years."
"When I have to put my email into a site to get rid of my ad blocker or to see what a site has to offer without creating an account, I say my email address is ElRushbo@eibnet.us.

That's Rush Limbaugh's email. So he gets spammed with all those annoying ads and newsletters. "
"In terms of cringiest -  
  
I was waiting at a bus stop and a dude started hitting on me. I wasn't into it and was being standoffish, and he then said something about knowing how to make me feel good. I said ""what?"" and that's when he put on a fake high voice and started imitating what a woman sounds like when she moans - for like a good twenty seconds.  
  
It was one of those situations when it's *so* awkward that you're just frozen, all I could do was stare at him. It went on until some other guy who was also waiting kind of muttered ""...oh my god, dude"" in this quietly horrified voice, and *that* made me burst out laughing.  
  
The guy stopped and didn't say a single other word, just walked away down the street. "
"Gonna go with The Big Bang Theory. You have brilliant scientists in a room and you're telling me the only thing they talk about is men? 

Mind you, I've only seen a few episodes so maybe its better and I just have poor luck, but it drives me INSANE. "
When the recruiter asked me how much money I made I put 20k on top of my current salary. When they asked me for my pay stub I made a fake one. That's right. I negotiated a 20k pay raise over a 10 minute phone call. Fuck you. 
"This isn't technically the worst, but it stands out in my mind because it was not street harassment or a stranger making a bad pass, but a guy I had been coming to think of as a friend: 

""Sometimes you might think someone is not that attractive when you first meet them, but they become beautiful to you over time because of their personality."" Followed by a REALLY SIGNIFICANT LOOK AT ME. 

Joke's on you though dude, my personality is actually even worse than my face. "
"Two Broke girls. 

That, and it's genuinely unfunny

"My only complaint in my marriage is that my husband is not a morning person. And I am.

In our state, you can get like $0.10 per bottle by returning them. There are homeless people that scan the neighborhood on trash day (which is now Tuesday, but they'll still come on Sunday, and they are fast, too). If I want to do something at a reasonable hour on Sunday, I put the trash out ~10 minutes before I would need to get my husband up. The clankety-clank-clank of the bottles being taken outside our window wakes him, and he cannot blame me for waking him"
"We bought a food processor that died a couple of days after the return period had passed.  So we went to a different store, bought the same food processor, returned it with the broken part and kept the one that worked."
"Long story short: 
Niceguy^TM offered me a ride home cause ""it's late and it's dangerous for a girl to catch a cab alone this late at night"" and shit. Stupid me got in a car and this fucker drove me to the middle of nowhere and said ""date me or I'll drop you off right here and you'll see how brutal other men can be."" 



"
"Growing up in a big family, I shocked many friends with how I could just invite people over without asking my folks. If you're cooking for 12 people, a few more won't matter, so there were always random kids and study-buddies over.

Now, as an adult, I never got rid of that habit. I pass out my house key like candy, there is a revolving door of whomever, come over, eat my food, drink my beer, it's all good. I didn't know that was considered weird until a few people pointed it out. "
"I've posted this before on another subreddit, but this is the guy that was really the worst...
&gt; 
&gt; The time I spent working at a comic shop, I got so many awkward Nice Guy encounters. One guy that really stands out would come into the store to buy action figures every Sunday. He wouldn't speak to me beyond the typical ""customer checking out at the register"" back and forth, but I was polite and friendly because it was my job.
&gt; 
&gt; So the Sunday before Valentine's Day, he actually talks to me and asks if I had any plans for the big day. I wasn't seeing anyone, so I told him I was just gonna be at home by myself that night. He said very pointedly, ""I don't have any plans for Valentine's Day either."" I gave him a big ""Hooray for people alone on Valentine's Day!"" And he left, and I thought nothing of it.
&gt; 
&gt; So Valentine's Day shows up, and a delivery guy brings a huge glass vase with like two dozen red roses, a heart-shaped box of chocolates, and a poem ripped from the Internet with my name copied and pasted into the blanks and covered with stickers of Vash the Stampede. That was easily $100 for the whole thing. It was sent by a guy named Aaron, and I had no clue who that was. No idea. I didn't know anyone named Aaron at all. The whole thing weirded me out, and I don't even like flowers or chocolates, so I gave the chocolates to my coworkers and the flowers to my mom and put it in the back of my mind.
&gt; 
&gt; The following Sunday comes around, and in comes the action figure guy. He asks me how my Valentine's Day went, and I start telling him about how some guy sent all these flowers that I didn't like and all this chocolate that I didn't eat and this super cheesy love poem... and his face just drops. And drops. And drops. And then it hits me. This guy is Aaron.
&gt; 
&gt; You can hear his heart break as he asks me, ""So, you didn't like it?"" I try to explain it was weird and awkward and I didn't even know his name... I don't even bring up the fact that I was 17 and he was about 35, reeked of cigarettes, and had really bad sweat stains on his holey white tshirt. He just turned and walked away, despondent.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought the whole thing was over and done... but I was wrong. When I was getting ready to leave that night when the shop closed, my coworker pointed out that Aaron was still sitting in his car in the parking lot, and had been there all day ever since he left like five or six hours previously. He was just staring at the door of the shop. I have no doubt in my mind he was waiting for me to leave, but I didn't wanna take any chances with what he might have wanted. My manager walked me to my car that night and every day for the next week and a half, just to be safe, but Aaron never showed back up again."
"I was on the only date i've ever been on.

He was wearing a watch, but the watch didn't have a face or internal mechanism, it was just the base and the  wristband. You know, like he'd taken all the necessary components out and was left with a really useless clunky bracelet.

I ask 'What's up with the watch?'
He says 'Oh, this watch doesn't tell time.'
I'll bite. 'What's it tell?'
'Well lets see... this says you're not wearing any panties.'
'That's not true.'
'Oh, it must be two hours fast.'

Never mind how gross this was on a first date, this guy PREPARED this. He EXPECTED me to ask why he was wearing a watch that didn't do anything. He probably rehearsed. He ruined a watch for the sole purpose of doing a really bad bit on dates.

I mean props for originality and dedication, but my god. So bad. 

Anyway I didn't go on a second date. "
When I realised he was rock hard after a couple of minutes of making out... was an awesome moment I’ll never forget 
"I had my first daughter at 15. She’s turning 17 next month. I’m very close to her, but it has been a struggle because more than anything I would have loved to give her more stability. She comes to me about anything that’s on her mind. We share the same humor and like silly comedies, and often have date nights. "
"I had a boyfriend when I met him (for four years) and the moment my ex and I broke up my “friend” decided to speak up and confess his feelings. I truly wasn’t interested in a relationship and he flipped out, began acting like I owed him a relationship because he had waited so long. I blocked him in the end from all social media. It sucks because I really thought we were friends."
It’s called anal glaucoma.  You can’t see your ass coming into work today.
"Those pictures with women who are clearly cocktail waitresses/strippers/Hooters girls/convention models/any other woman who is definitely not his personal friend and he's just getting a picture with because they look hot and are paid to be nice to him.  I honestly don't recommend pictures with other women at *all*, even if she's just your friend/sister/cousin (grandmother would be my only exception), but this is just baffling.  It's not that a guy would take such a picture (usually they look like they're at some kind of fun event, so you do you), but that seems more like a picture you'd put in a Facebook album or on your phone to show your guy friends, not on a profile that you made to date or hook up with girls."
"On a similar note, I work for a university. The staff card is nearly identical to the student card, the only difference is there's one logo missing from the back. But literally no one knows about that. The expiry date on my card is in 10 years, so here's to 10 years of student discounts!"
Husband and I had just met and I had a chronic case of needing to stay in bed with him. 
"I just hated my job too much to force myself to go to it.

I got up in the morning and got dressed and just... couldn't think of a reason to do it.  I had no responsibilities at that job and I didn't want to go there and deal with sitting there."
Burned my hand on a TV dinner. Called in sick the following day. Went to A&amp;E and got it seen to. Back to work the next day only to further burn my hand after spilling tea on it. Boss sent me home for 3 days so I could pull myself together.
"""I like that you have an eating disorder...It means you don't think you're hot even though you are, so you'll never try to leave me!"""

"I took out my phone and told him sure, just drop me off. I'll just call 911 and see if they could drive me home or something. (Honestly I don't know if it worked that way or not. It was my first year in the US.)                  

Then this asshole said he was just joking. I told him it wasn't funny; it was disgusting and very rapey tbh. Then he went on trying to justify himself by blaming on the alcohol and eventually blaming it on me lmao. (Oh yeah, that was how I also learned that this fucker drank before offering me a ride. Lovely.)              

Anyway, I safely got home. But the horror hadn't ended. The following week, he showed up at my place at random times trying to apologize and shit.                "
"Hey I gave birth once! 

Also I teach human development which covers childbirth extensively. 

Anyway, you might poop. No one cares and you won't notice. 

There's a scratchy band they put around your stomach for fetal monitoring. It sucks. Really uncomfortable. 

Everyone and their assistant wants to check your cervix- they do it all day long and don't realize it's invasive sometimes so if you're uncomfortable with this (I was), tell them you don't want to be checked unless absolutely necessary. 

Labor itself really felt like extremely bad gas mixed with period cramps. Like I felt like I had to rush to the bathroom the whole time. I hear it's different for everyone though. 

It stops hurting completely right after baby is out (I went without drugs) due to a rush of bonding hormones and adrenaline. You'll be sore later but right after I actually felt really great. 

You're going to be sooooo hungry and it feels like you did abs ten days in a row at the gym for about a week after. 

Good luck! "
"Get stuff ready for the next day the night before. Bag, any equipment, clothes, even your breakfast (overnight oats for example). Saves you rushing around in the morning when you're not at your optimum.

Do a little often. Like cleaning. Tidy as you go, wash up as you go, wipe down some surfaces every day etc. I find it much easier to keep on top of household tasks if I don't have to confront it all in one big go."
 you'd think it's a special vagina push but it's actually exactly like taking a poop. Your butthole will hurt so bad because of your tail bone bending to accommodate the babies head. I was surprised by  not hurting in any of the places I though I would. Also... 50% of women suffer from prolapse after. So once you're healed up... if you're having a hard time pooping or holding your pee in go talk to a physiotherapist. Trickling pee while laughing or sneezing IS NOT something you need to live with. 
"Costco. My mother got me a membership when I was in college and it has been a lifesaver ever since. I get all my bulk items there. If I know I'm going to use a lot of it (TP, coffee, evoo, detergent, chicken, etc.) I buy it there. 

I'll even buy some clothes there if I like the item and I am MORE THAN HAPPY to tell everyone I got it at costco if someone asks. "

"Resume Footprint, they are a professional resume and cover letter writing service. The work they did to overhaul my resume, cover letter and linkedin profile was nothing short of amazing. I thought I had a good resume, but then I received their version. All I can say about my previous resume now is ""hahahahhahahaha, nice try."" I went from average a 20% response rate on applications to a 70% response rate after having my resume and cover letter overhauled.

I've recommend them to half a dozen friends and all rave about the work they did. 

Seriously, if you're job hunting, get them to write your resume. It will be some of the best money you ever invest in your career. "

"When I was an Undergrad I was going through a pretty rough patch financially. My mom could not help me at all because of illness in the family and I was crashing at a friends couch for months at this point.
I went to a local supermarket and got about $50 worth of groceries (money I didn't have and was gonna go in the red for, untill I got payed the following week). The casheer rang all my stuff and when he was done  I saw a granola bar and asked him to price check that for me. ""$2.50 he said."". ""Ok, I'll take it"". I payed with my debit card and left.
On my way home, I checked the receipt and realised the casheer had made a mistake and only charged me the 2.50 for ALL my groceries. I really thought about going back, but I started crying with relieve in knowing I didn't have to spend all that money after all. At the time I thought it was the Universe finally giving me a break or something. Nowadays I would have gone back to pay for it, regardless of financial struggle, but DAMN, I still kinda think it was the universe, and I feel a bit guilty that I actually don't really regret my decision."
"Bought a book the day before and couldn't stop reading. I fell asleep with the book in my hands and woke up shortly after that because I dreamed of the book. Repeating that all night long I couldn't go to work. I just had to read the whole book in one sitting.

Act confident even if you don’t really feel that way. People will believe it and treat you better. Also don’t be afraid to ask for what you want even if it seems ridiculous. Doors may open that you never imagined would have all because you asked for it. 
"Some women here seem to think that a vagina is streched out by several penises or something. Thats not how it works. Having a child probably will, but not the amount of penises. If you feel the need to either stretch, or rather get used to different sizes inside you, try out different dildos and vibrators. In the end that experience will be much more about getting to know your own body and what you like than physically practicing, either way you will learn a lot."
"American Pie. In the first movie the main protagonist films a girl undressing and masturbating without her knowledge, and all the males in the film think it's perfectly normal and fine. Not to mention the fact that the girl in question is never shown to have had an issue with it even after it got her sent away from the school. Didn't realise how terrible it was until I saw it again as an adult."
"I think that it's definitely affecting younger people. I'm in my thirties and when I was maturing, learning about my sexuality and experiencing everything for the first time, porn wasn't nearly as available and easily accessible. 

In my own experience, the guys I've slept with who are a bit younger than me have been very different than guys my own age or older. They were rougher, entitled, it was more about taking rather than a mutually enjoyable act. They tried to push their dick down my throat without communication, didn't understand why I didn't orgasm from basically nothing (or didn't even acknowledge my pleasure/orgasm at all). Some thought anal is something they should be able to have whenever they want and told me to just ""relax and it'll be fine"" when they attempted to do it without enthusiastic consent or lube/prep. One guy pulled out of my vagina and tried to just jam it into my ass. Seriously what the fuck. ""It's wet so it's okay."" 

Honestly it makes me feel really sad and a bit scared for women younger than I am when I think about it. I think the entire thing is absolutely disgusting. I have no problem with porn but I have a huge problem when porn is a young person's first glimpse at sexuality. They watch the one sided fantasy for years and then when they become sexually active, it's all they know. It grosses me out. "
"When I was in college, I didn’t want to pay to get a parking pass for the year (hundreds of dollars). So I parked in the parkade every day until I got a ticket. I put the ticket in my car. From then on every day I would Park my car, put the ticket under my wiper, go to school and then take the ticket off my car and drive home. Parkade security would see the ticket and think someone else had already ticketed the vehicle. Not once did I get another ticket. Total cost of parking for the year: 35 dollars. "

"My SIL (my husband's brother's wife) waited until marriage to have sex.  Six months or so after they were married, I asked her, basically, ""Well?""  She said, ""It's okay but nothing special.""  I said nothing, but wondered if it was him, her, or the combination that had a problem.  A newlywed bored with sex that fast?  Something's off, or maybe one/both has/have low libidos.

I waited for the right man, but didn't wait for marriage.  He's the only man I've been with, the only one I ever kissed.  I was 24; it's been 30 years this year.  I'm happy I waited."

"I actually dated a neckbeard/nice guy when I was 14.  He was only a few years older but it was pretty obvious he couldn't get a girl his own age.  He literally said ""m'lady,"" engaged in really unnecessary acts of chivalry, made really really graphic sex jokes about me secretly being bisexual but flipped out when I turned the tables on him and asked him if he was bisexual (so I guess he was also a homophobe), he dreamed of someday becoming a Samurai, didn't have the best hygiene, and when I dumped him after 2 horrible weeks he started something with his best friend called ""Operation Revenge,"" and I still don't know what it entailed."
"After a mutual friend told Guy I was a virgin when we were all sitting around bullshitting half drunk at a party.

Guy ""Oh, so you have never had a dick inside you?  I can fix that for you real quick.""

Me ""Yeah, haha, no."" and I tried to leave.

Guy grabs my arm and pulls me back down to my seat and holds on ""Don't leave just yet, I want to convince you.""

Me ""I already said no, dude."" and I try pull my arm away from him.

Guy ""Oh, you will say yes later tonight.""  And he jerked my arm until I was kneeling in front of him.

Me ""Dude, fuck off!""

Mutual friend ""Guy, stop that.  It isn't funny.""

Guy ""She will like it when she finds out how good I am.""

I just glare at this guy, scared out of my fucking wits.

Guy lets me go and laughs. ""I am just joking around!  Take a break, bitch!""

And then he starts bringing me drinks every so often and trying to put his hands on me.  I keep pushing him away and he just keeps laughing and saying ""Later then?"""
"my ex husband was pretty much *the* neckbeard stereotype. liked anime, talked in netspeak, called me ''loli'', watched the worst neckbeard atheist youtubers obsessively, you name it.

any time i didn't agree with him, i was misinformed or not using logic. if i was in a bad mood nothing i said could be taken seriously because i was bringing ''emotion'' into it. but when he was upset he'd literally talk in that whiny voiiiiice just like a chiiiild but that wasn't emotion, that was a logical *reaction* to me being difficult."

He came home and called me and we went for coffee. I told him all about my broken heart.  He had fooled around in Europe but nothing serious. Two months later he came over to hang out and we sort of looked at one another and knew. Friendship turned to dating. We've been married 40 years!

"Two moments stand out for me-

I had an abusive stepmother who told me that I was ugly when I was growing up. My half sister and step siblings would join in mocking my appearance and so it was something that was so ingrained in me that I didn't ever question it. She also cut off my hair which probably didn't help with the whole looks thing. 

When I was 13, I had a house party and had my first kiss with an older guy who was pretty popular with all the girls on our street. I remember overhearing him telling someone that he liked me but I was too young. I remember being really surprised. 

When I was around 14, a girl in my class approached me out of the blue and told me that she thought I was the prettiest girl in our class. So that was pretty odd too. "

"The Mirena IUD. I've tried several different types of birth controls and this is the best thing ever. No periods, no remembering to take a pill/ get a shot, lasts for 5 years with one of the most effective rates. I tell everyone I know how much I love it. I know not everyone has the same reaction, but it's worth a shot because it can always be removed. Also, for women that can't have hormonal birth control, I've heard good things about the copper IUD as well.

"I had a few tricks that seemed to help for almost every situation. 

If I'm at work: I go to the bathroom and allow myself to disconnect for a few minutes. Maybe cry if I have to then wash my face with warm water and just breathe slowly enough for it to help but not enough for a panic attack. 

In public: Find an isolated place and just look at the scenery around me, whatever it may be. I look at the people who look calm and happy and let them inspire me to do the same. Look at how the trees blow in the wind and try to focus on one leaf and how it's moving and is one simple thing in a big mess of other things. Watch the rain or snow fall and just breathe. Look out the window and watch the cars going by and just focusing on the license plate.

At home: Take a bath. Light a candle and stare at the flame. Close my eyes for as long as I need to."
"So it's not a deal breaker, but so many guys won't post a picture of them actually SMILING. Even some of my guy friends do this. They're very attractive, but then they try to do this weird smolder eyebrow raise at the camera and it just looks SO stupid. "
I waited and I regret it. I think I built up sex in my head to the point where I have panic attacks when trying to have sex. I developed vaginismus and have no been able to have pain free sex. I dated a guy for two years before my husband. He has a much smaller penis than my husband and I wish I had used that as a stepping stone. Little did I know. 
"Oh man I have one. In high school a “friend” offered me a ride home. Ended up going to the end of a dirt road because he wanted to dump all his feelings on me. I really tried to be nice but I just wasn’t into him. He leaned in for a totally unwanted kiss, and I poured my Dr.Pepper all over my pants so he would take me home to change. 

Obviously me accepting said ride home meant I totally wanted to sleep with him. "

"Such short period of foreplay on woman's body is enough for arousing her and for her to have a satisfying experience. That's not how it goes for most women.

Also that a woman (or a man for that matter) can perform oral sex on a guy for a long time. They take breaks when shooting a porn movie. If any guy thinks it shouldn't be uncomfortable to suck a dick for [insert the amount of minutes they expect] they should try it on a dildo to see what it's like. The jaw hurts after a while, dudes."
"At the time, I had a boyfriend. When my friend confessed, I told him that I was flattered but obviously not interested as I was taken. He told me that he respected that, and had just wanted to be honest with me. 

After that, things went pretty much back to normal. He even got a girlfriend a few months later. However, a year or so down the line I started to get the feeling that he wasn't really over me, as he started misinterpreting everything I did as ""flirting"" with him. I chalked this up to wishful thinking on his part. He argued that he was over me, but I knew he wasn't. We had a falling out, and didn't really speak for the next 2 years.

Then in late 2014, we started talking again. We apologised and forgave each other and went back to being friends, except he lived in a different country with his girlfriend, so all our chatting was text/phone call based. 

In early 2015, his girlfriend ended things with him and he moved back, though to a different part of the country, 200 miles from where I lived. Around the same time, my boyfriend and I also broke up, for various complicated reasons. 

Some time later, my friend told me that he had some time off work coming up, and decided to come down and visit me for a couple of days, as we hadn't seen each other in years. 

Well, that was it. We met up, both single at the same time for the first time ever, and sparks flew. He moved down to be with me, and two and a half years later we're engaged to be married.

Sometimes it these things do have a happy ending! "

"When I was agoraphobic and didn't feel comfortable to open up to my not-close-friends about it, they were getting offended why I was rejecting invitations. What I did was, I used every oppurtunity to invite them somewhere for the time they weren't going to be available. Friend close to his mother, his mother's birthday is on Saturday? He will definitely leave the city to visit the mother, I would ask if he wants to see a movie together. Someone is going to work on Sunday that week too? Pretend like I didn't know it, invite her somewhere for Sunday. This way it became *we* can't arrange a time together and not that *I* always say no.  (I was very young when I did this for the records. Now I would just tell the truth.)"
"Their deeds and actions matter far more to me that whether or not they declare themselves a feminist.

"Singing along to my favourite song

The way my dog looks at me

My cat choosing to sleep next to me

The smell of my horse

A good laugh with my friends

Watching the colors on the mountains change out my kitchen window

The little ways my SO supports me every day

Our 2 week old goslings getting bigger every day

Thanks for asking because writing this list has reminded me how lucky I am. Some days just seem so bleak. Today was one of those days."
I had a surprise niceguy moment. Chatting with a taxi driver about me landscaping/planting trees in my yard and he flips it to how selfish and ungrateful attractive young women like me are. 
"A guy followed me around on the train platform and told me he would push me off when the train is coming when I told him to fuck off.

An older man gave me a key to his hotel room, after I told him I wasn't interested and I was smiling at him because I'm his waitress (and I was 18 years old, nearly 30 years younger, at least) and he told me if I took the key there'd be some money upstairs waiting for me.

A guy told me I must be racist since I wasn't interested in his catcalling.

I mean, you pick the worst, they're all a special kind of shitty for me."
"The actress also has some ...interesting views on assault. She said some weird things in an NYT op-ed about how because she always dresses modestly and doesn't flirt with men, she has not been a target of sexual violence or harassment. It kind of figures - you'd have to have a fairly skewed view of sexual dynamics, feminism, and assault to work on this show.

Posting a link to an article with her apology for full context.

"The scifi movie Arrival. It's the most profoundly feminist movie I've ever seen in a theater and it doesn't even explicitly address social justice. So many movies have some female side character with 1 quippy ""Oh, because I'm a woman???"" line, and a ""male love interest walks in on her while she's in her black lacy bra changing"" scene. Arrival had a female protagonist who was in a liberal arts field (linguistics) and didn't exist to be the bleeding heart, the robot bitch, or the sexy sidekick. She's shown to be, and is widely treated as, competent and brilliant. She's not the whiny bitch compared to the astrophysics dudes. She wasn't shown in her bra a single time and her male love interest didn't harrass her whatsoever. In fact, her love interest really just existed to revolve around *her* story. I really think she's the only female character I can actually say has gotten the male protagonist treatment. "
"I opened my door and there was a giant, scary looking possum on my porch, blocking the exit. I was living in a small cottage at the time that didn't have another outside door, so it was the only way out besides climbing out a window. I just shut the door, and called in ""sick"" because I was too scared to go near the possum."
"I truly feel bad about this because Amazon treats their users well, but I used to make a new Amazon account every month so that I could get a free trial of Prime. You can also sign up with the same email with a period placed in it so that you don't have to make a new email account every time (if you have Gmail, emails sent to xyz@gmail.com, x.yz@gmail.com, and xy.z@gmail.com all go to the same inbox, but Amazon thinks they're all different addresses).

I eventually got a six-month Amazon Prime Student trial and forgot to cancel it so now I pay for the service, lol."
"That all women like anal, being slapped and choked, being called names, and having cum on their face, and that men can do these things without asking. And that if you don’t like these things, you’re a “prude”.

Also that all women’s buttholes and vulvas are the exact same color as the rest of their body, and that if they’re darker it means there’s something wrong with them.

Every single character on that show was a horrifying caricature. It's like what I'd expect to see playing on the TV in the waiting room to Hell.
"I don't know if this is the kind of answer you're looking for, but my birth mother was 15 when I was born. I have never talked to her, I don't know what or how she's doing and I'm not interested in finding out. I hope she's doing alright but that's the extent of it."
Yeah.... for a long time it was one of my favorite shows. I’ve watched it through like 16 times and every time I see it again I’m appalled by how awful the things they say are. But I actually think Ted is worse than Barney because at least Barney is upfront. Ted loved to play victim and turn around and treat everyone woman like crap. 
"I think Bob's Burgers, mostly because the female characters are treated as whole people."
"Just want to add. I gave birth twice. I noticed when I pooped and so did everyone else. Yes they cared. It smelled and was fucking horrible. There I said it. Let’s be honest. Pooping is disgusting and everyone is staring at that hole they’re gonna see it. 

I had a 9 lb baby without an epidural. It felt like Satan reached his hand into my asshole and was trying to rip my spine out. It is the worst pain I’ve ever had. Forgot I was having a baby and wanted to die. 

It still hurts after having a baby. Don’t get me wrong I still got and showered and dressed and walked around. But there may be hemorrhoids and tearing. It fucking hurts. 

It hurts for like a fucking month. I mean did you fart or give birth here. "
There was a stretch a few years ago where I had zero money so I used Tinder for dinner dates so that I could eat at least once a day. Bonus if I had leftovers from the date before.

We drifted apart. I didn't feel comfortable with our friendship any longer as I always questioned his motive.
Not the focus demographic you're addressing but.. I had my oldest son the day before my 17th birthday. We grew up together and we're very close. He's married to a wonderful woman and I could not be more proud.
Getting a woman to a secluded location alone where she is reliant on you for transportation and perceives she is at risk for her safety is a very common coercive and manipulative sexual tactic used by assholes.
"It's bizarre. Like, okay, I've met all your requirements. Do you have any reasons why I should be interested in *you?*"
"It was confusing for me. Guys told me I was the ugliest person on the planet but when I tell someone else they were astonished and kept telling me, I'm not ugly. Since high school and end of middle school, I got compliments from strangers. However, I think this will always play a roll in my self-confidence."
"Spotify. I used to pirate a ton of music in my younger days, but I signed up and never downloaded another album. For $15 me, my wife, and my mom all have premium accounts and I spend so many hours a day listening to music. I've also discovered a ton of new stuff through playlists (theirs and others'). "
I think a lot of those films are super sexist. The sexual awakening movies always focus on men and make women objects.

Ordering extra items to get free shipping then returning them 
"I know the thread is about unethical, but I still wanted to say: Anyone who is considering this should really try contacting the company that made the product, which likely came with a longer warranty than the return period is. Or if you bought it on a credit card, check if that card has return protection for the item that is longer than the return period. Or check with the original retailer or original retailer's corporate customer service, which may replace it for you if it's that close.

There are lots of ways this kind of thing can be handled for the same result legally! :)"
"On a social media platform for kinky individuals where I identify as a switch, random men love to pop into my inbox with lengthy, graphic descriptions of what they'd do to me/expect me to do for them, including calling them Master. When I say fuck off or no, the response I get is 'I'm the dominant, you'll do what I say. Now give me your address and be waiting naked for me.'

Pffffffthahaha, no bucko, that isn't how this works at all."

"Friends. As much as I love some aspects of that show, Joey is awful to women, Ross is awful to Rachel, and while the show does have 3 female main characters, they’re all portrayed in 3 stereotypical “feminine” ways: Rachel as a materialistic bimbo (for lack of a better word), although her progression into a self-assured independent woman is pretty great, Monica as a homebody, and Phoebe is kinda cooky. Also there’s a lot of homophobia which sucks. "
"Two and a Half Men! The women are quite often a mixture of crazy, clingy, selfish/uncaring or borderline sociopathic, or disposable/forgettable dumb ditzes. The closest thing to ""normal everyday"" is hired help who herself has her evil moments, and the imperfectly perfect unattainable women. Female characters used as objects to use as a foil, have sex with, or acquire like a perfect piece of art. I'm still at a loss how it lasted so long, even when Charlie Sheen left. "
"This dude actually went to the same college and lived in the same apartment complex with my bf. So I told him about this, bf was really surprised (and terrified) cause this dude was like a complete different person to him: very friendly, very polite, always helped people out and stuff.                       
Bf confronted him and he turned aggressive. Bf moved in with me and this dude stopped showing up. Before he stopped, he actually sent my bf a text saying that he regretted wasting his time ""courting"" me and I was just a whore like every other woman out there. lmao. 
"
"Frasier. I'm watching it for the first time now, and although for the most part I enjoy the soothing and mindless nature of it, I'm a little skeeved out by some of the running gags / themes in the show:

1. Niles is obsessed with Daphne Moon. He stares at her, starts to fantasize (ostensibly sexually) if she makes a remark that could be misconceived sexually, and in one episode films her file she's sleeping. The show shows the ""footage"" all through the end credits - the audience is supposed to find it hilarious but it's really creepy as hell.
2. Roz is always chided by Frasier for her love and sex life. He often states that she can't ""keep a man"" because she ""sleeps around"" so much. She is always miserable because her love life sucks, despite having a great career. Of course, he is always to be congratulated when he goes out with a new woman. Gross! 
3. Daphne Moon is a healthcare professional - a physiotherapist for Frasier's dad. So why is she always doing all the domestic tasks around the house, including ironing Frasier's underwear, cooking all the meals, and answering the doorbell? 
4. I've never seen it pass the Bechdel test.

On the whole the show is still lighthearted fun, but these things do rankle and make me want to stop watching. Friends can be problematic in its own way but leaps and bounds ahead of this show that was on at the same time."
"Expecting that you be perfectly hairless at all times and just generally behave and *perform* like a pornstar instead of a person who's looking to have your own independent fun. Also the normalization of anal and violent sex with the idea that all or most women like these things, thus leading men to try them without even asking first. Literally had a dude random put his hand over my throat cause he assumed I would like it and it didn't even occur to him that it would actually scare the shit out of me.

Ruined? No, I'm not even sure what that would entail. Severely damaged and added loads of toxicity to? For sure."
"Also on a similar note, my student card doesn't have an expiry date so I can use it forever!"
"Men get this bizarre advice from PUA sources that surrounding yourself with beautiful women somehow raises your “social value” or something and women will just start clamoring to be with you. It’s super strange and, to me and every woman I know, it’s a turn-off to purposely cultivate this weird “playboy” image. 

Just an example of men telling women what they “really” want and not listening to women. "
"Sometimes they do. But also, sometimes the cop says ""Well he hasn't done anything so there's nothing we can do"" and makes you feel stupid.

I loooooove going to concerts alone. I got tired to dragging my friends to see shows with me. I know it can be pricey but I see some great live stuff for $12CAD a ticket sometimes. It's also kind of a thrill to have to be alone in a crowd. 
"Wow, that went from weird, socially awkward dude to straight-up stalker really damn quick. Good on your manager for walking you to your car."
"With my first baby, no one told me about it feeling like you have to poop, I kept trying to push where I felt the baby would be coming out. Finally, I just pushed like I was taking the biggest poop of my life and she was out. It could have been so much sooner if I had known. So know I tell every first time mother that I can."
"I can't rewatch *Friends* because Ross has actually ruined it for me. And all the jokes that revolved around ""Fat Monica"" leaves such a bad taste in my mouth. "
"&gt; Self-deprecating ""I'm sure you won't be interested in me, but ...""

"I've been told by friends (and my husband's coworkers) that it's really uncommon that I cook dinner every night for my husband and myself. I always cook a main course and a side or two and I'm constantly baking so we usually have a dessert or two (I have an apple tart and chocolate chip banana bread in the fridge right now) that last us all week. We don't usually go out unless it's a special occasion. I didn't think that was uncommon, but due to what my friends have been saying recently I'm curious if it is all that uncommon. This will probably end up being one of the lamer comments."
Just yesterday a man my fathers age knocked on my window in the parking lot of Trader Joe’s. I sincerely thought I had dropped my wallet or my tire was messed up or something. No. This guy says “I was just wondering whether or not you’re involved with anyone” and in panic mode I lied and said yes because ew. He said “you look young but I’m a terrible judge of age.” Bro you’re a balding overweight 50-something year old man hitting on a small blonde chick you think looks young?? I told him I’m 27 and he laughed in an ashamed way and said I’m “younger than both his daughters.” I was thoroughly creeped out and made sure my doors were locked and I sat there for a few minutes to make sure he didn’t see where I was driving home to. Wtf dude. You saw me in Trader Joe’s and followed me to my car? This was up there with the worst for me.

Their store brands are literally the same as ""name brands"" but with a different label. They also have unique things you can't get at other stores. The only complaint I have is that the produce isn't a great selection, but what they do have is cheap as hell. They also have gluten-free options for those who need it. It's just awesome. My boyfriend and I actually *enjoy* grocery shopping and seeing how much we get for so cheap."
"Birth injuries. They happen and are not talked about nearly enough. Doctors almost never discuss them. So many things can happen to you as a result of giving birth than can affect sex, continence, etc. I had an emergency episiotomy when my daughter’s shoulder got stuck. I also had some tearing and developed a micro-fistula and rectocele (along with nerve damage) that has led to some degree of bowel and bladder incontinence. I was extremely fortunate to find an amazing pelvic floor PT who helped me get back a lot of bowel control. While I’ll never be 100%, I have managed to avoid surgery for now and am able to manage my issues. 

Overall, I would have found the whole childbirth injury experience far less distressing if someone had just told me that this can happen and there’s ways to deal with it. I waited almost 2 years before seeking help. "
"You can actually develop vaginismus from the trauma to the area. I learned that first hand! I couldn't have sex for over 18 months after.

"I was abstinent because I was not into casual sex or having sex with someone just because we were dating. I didn’t want to go from being that intimate with someone and then to not even dating/talking. 

Pro: my spouse being the first and only person I’ve been with. All the fabulous emotions that come with being intimate with your spouse. 

Con: it was painful for the first 6-9 months and I would get vaginal tears during those months. My husband had many partners before me so he is very experienced and it makes me self conscious at times. I have some performance insecurities. He tells me I’m great but I sometimes have thoughts of other women he’s had being better or not being able to do certain things well. It’s been a big learning experience of knowing what I like whereas he knows exactly what he likes because he’s experienced. 

If I could go back in time I would still be abstinent. I love that he was my first and sharing that special experience with him. Although the cons are all performance issues, he has been a great teacher. I can comfortably ask for guidance."

"Attraction based purely on looks?

It was when I ran into a group of acquaintances from high school. I was a very heavy teen, and lost a significant amount of excess fat and weight over the past year. People were nicer to me, which I assumed was because now I wasn't 'big', since being big is somehow seen as an offense here.

One of the popular guys from that group (known for being absolutely shallow) blatantly looked me up and down in appreciation, then smirked at me and said ""Damn, Minang. I don't know what happened while you were away, but I like the way you look now. I *really* like the way you look.""

Genuine attraction, based not just on looks? 

The second date with my ex. It lasted for well over six hours through the rain, insane crowds and well past the time public transportation had stopped. We talked about everything and nothing, with him absentmindedly stroking my hair as I laid down on the bench with my head in his lap. My taxi came, and as I moved away, he pulled me back for a bunch of kisses, then immediately asked for a series of consecutive dates for when he came back to town."
"Him: Hey can I get your number?

Me: I'm sorry, no I don't give out my number to strangers

him: yeah but if you give me your number and we talk we won't be strangers

Him: yeah but I'm a great guy you don't know what you are saying no to

Me:  I'm sure you are, bye

him: You're a stuck up bitch.  all I wanted was your number I was doing you a favor

Me: I'm sure you think that, now please let go of my arm

Him: I'll get go when I'm ready to let go, you can't tell me what to do. You don't derve a great guy like me

me: how about I call the police?

he then storms off calling me names again.  I can't tell you how much I wish I hadn't given up that great gem of a guy (insert sarcastic eye roll here in case that wasn't obvious)"
"My college's parking patrol would check dates on the tickets. They were meticulous and evil. I once turned in a paper due at 2:45 and had to park in a lot I wasn't registered for. Parked at 2:35
 Delivered the paper at 2:40. Walked out and found a ticket from 2:37. They were almost omniscient. 

One guy thought he would just get one ticket so didn't move his car. After three weeks of tickets piled under his windshield, a boot was placed on his car with a notice that it wouldn't be removed until he paid his outstanding balance. Well, he never moved it when he could, and now he cant so he still didn't pay. And got more tickets.

He ended up removing the boot by letting his tire go flat, taking the whole thing off, putting on the spare and driving away. Then he just never parked there again. His car wasn't registered with the school system so they couldn't track him down. He had a stack of parking tickets at the end of it all that he would show off."
"The best white water rafting guide I had had the worst neckbeard I have ever seen. It was gnarly and greasy and it looked like he may have been able to grow a half decent beard on his face but he shaved it off. He paired it with a waist-long braid. I never knew what a true neckbeard was until that moment. 

He littered his on-the-way-to-the-river bus speech with potent life lessons and remembered a group of 30+ peoples names and faces after hearing them once. He was funny and chill and a true river rat that loved sharing his passion with people.

Doug. The man who brought me safely down the class five Gualey. Doug, the man who taught me the truth of a river rat neck beard."
"That labia are supposed to be pretty, pink, and small. I'm pretty sure this is the reason that stupid ""roast beef = slut"" myth exists. A lot of men have no idea what an average woman's body actually looks like. 

I also think a lot of men assume that if a woman looks attractive with clothes on then she must have the body of a pornstar underneath. And then they actually see a woman naked and they're horrified to discover brown assholes, tits that don't hold themselves up, wrinkly purple vag lips, and cellulite. "
My mom had me at 16 and our relationship is great. There have been some times when I felt like she wasn't adult enough to be a parent but for the most she was a great mom.

"A cup of herbal tea just before going to bed. It makes me feel in charge of my life that I can do that. It helps me enforce a reasonable bedtime for myself (since I always have tea just before bed), which then gives me a lot more energy the next day.

It gives me something that takes almost zero effort to look forward to on the hardest days. No matter how shitty work or life gets, I can rely on knowing I can boil some water, pour it in a cup and put a teabag in it.

I have so many types of herbal tea, so I also get enjoyment out of trying something a bit different every day too!"

- Also, assuming certain sex acts are standard.  Sorry, but a lot of women out there are either 1) not into anal sex, facials, BDSM or 2) ARE into them, but would still find it extremely creepy to have it expected/forced without either dating a while first or having discussion"
Brooklyn 99 is really good. Everyone has such diverse personalities. It's good stuff.
"I think sometimes consent is oversimplified to the point where it becomes easy for people to dismiss or find ridiculous. I'm talking about when people say stuff like ""You always need to ask for consent."" Yes, that's true in a sense, but I think it vastly oversimplifies the issue. You see this all the time, particularly from young men, asking in retaliation things like: ""Won't asking for her consent kill the mood?"" ""Do I have to ask for verbal consent for every single action I take? Every kiss, every touch?"" ""If I'm in a relationship, do I need to ask for consent every single day? Every hour? Every minute?"" They place the emphasis on *asking* for consent, rather than recognising that consent comes in many different forms. And people focus on the marginal cases rather than the much more common clear cut cases.

In terms of explaining it to younger generations, I think it has to start early. Consent isn't just about sexual interactions but come into all social interactions. I used to teach 7 - 8 year olds about consent, about their bodily autonomy and about how they should express openly what they do and do not like, whilst also being respectful of what others do and do not like with regards to their bodies. I taught them how to recognise both verbal cues and body language cues of when someone may not enjoy an interaction. We practiced it through role playing and keeping an open dialogue, solving conflicts peacefully and being aware of others and when they're in difficulty. I taught them about context, and how different contexts can mean different behaviour is acceptable (e.g. a doctor can ask to see your body for medical reasons whereas another adult may not unless there are good reasons you consent to). And by educating early, hopefully those nuanced situations in life become easier to interpret and young people build up a body of tools to help them assess and evaluate a situation. Simply stating 'easy to follow rules' or really simplified codes of conduct are often too late, in a society where those rules aren't ingrained."
"It's ok to have a ""birth plan."" But expect that plan may change. Don't suffer if you need pain killers/epidurals. You may end up in the operating room getting a C-section.

Be vigilant and aware and your own self-advocate but the situation may change instantly and you have to let go and go with the flow.

"I hang a spray bottle of stain remover on my clothes hamper.  When I get undressed, I pretreat any stains right then, and throw in the hamper.  I don’t have to remember or find stains before laundering, and the pretreat has had maximum time to work.

Everything in my pantry is grouped and in bins.  If I want to bake, I pull out the baking bin and the most common items are all there.  Same for the bathroom and cleaning items.

I parked down my kitchen so very few things are on the counter.  Makes cleaning a breeze and using my kitchen pleasant.  Same in the bathroom.

I keep shoe spray on the shelf unit in my closet with my shoes.  Every night when I take off my shoes and put them away, I spray the insides to keep the funk away.

I put 3M hooks in the shower opposite the shower head - that’s where my shower caddy hangs.  The stuff on it doesn’t get soaked and goopy since it’s out of the line of the shower head, and I don’t bonk my head on it trying to rinse my hair.  I also use 3M hooks to hang my bath mat on the shower wall so it can drain and dry and not get manky.

I use chenille gloves from the dollar store to dust.  Makes it easy and the blinds get cleaned much quicker and more often.

I use vinegar instead of fabric softener in the rinse for my towels so they can be soft, fresh, and fluffy without the residue from softener that interferes with absorbency.

My spices are alphabetically organized.

I may need help...

"1. Abortions more freely available with less stigma.
2. Parental leave/Childbirth leave/Pregnancy leave would be a standard benefit.
3. Contraception options would be easily and freely available without stigma.
4. One ridiculous argument for gender bias (women spend x amount of time pregnant!) would disappear, leading to more equal treatment.
5. Child custody arrangements would be more clearly handled based on suitability to provide the best home for the child.
6. Refusal to provide financial child support would have  more serious consequences.
7. Being a single parent (who gave birth without being married to a partner) would likely have less social stigma."

"I made the mistake of dating someone who was separated and not divorced, which I will never do again. Because he had children and was sorting custody out with his soon to be ex, he didn't want anyone to know about our relationship, because legally it was considered adultery. I began to feel like the other woman and the relationship became more about when he was legally going to be divorced. I was constantly nagging him about what his lawyer had said and why things weren't moving faster. We ended up breaking up over it, but got back together a few months later when he was legally divorced. We didn't work out for other reasons but I learned my lesson."

"AHHHHH I LOVE THAT YOU POSTED THIS QUESTION, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE INSIDE MY MIND RIGHT NOW.  
  
So I've been watching The Newsroom the last couple of days because a) I loved West Wing and Studio 60, and b) I enjoy cranky Jeff Daniels.  
  
*However*, as much as I've liked other Sorkin shows in the past, this show is (entertaining! Still entertaining!) a COMPLETE mess. It's like all of Sorkin's other noticeable traits (he reuses lines like crazy in all his shows [""fraction of a man"", etc], walk-and-talks, rapid-fire genius-level dialogue, political/social sermonizing) have exploded into an ""I'm not even trying"" anymore level, and his benevolent sexism has reached new heights, it's almost comical.  
  
He just has to shoehorn in a scene in every show where a righteous male character rebukes another male character for using bad language in front of women, so many of the male characters are written as these paternalistic mentor/daddy (but still sexual, don't worry) foils for idealistic, scrappy, look-at-me-on-my-pedestal, I'm-as-smart-as-any-man-but-also-exquisitely-feminine women. The women need to be rescued *so often*, and there's always these scenes where the righteous male lead sacrifices something/has some sort of showdown with another male for a woman's honour/rescue and it's never something she *knows* happens because the male character gets to be a silent Batman and only the audience sees his unsung heroism.  
  
Honestly it's just so earnest and trying so hard to be respectful of women while incorporating so much focus on them *being* women that it's weird and hilarious in an absurd way. "

We watched movies together and played PnP RPGs together with the group and he even came to my HS graduation(I was a year behind the rest of my friend group) even though he had moved a state away by that time.

Later, after I was getting ready to join the military, he came to me and confessed his eternal love and that I should move to OK to be with him.  I told him no and I had already signed up to join the military and he blew up at me.

He told me that he had ""wasted all that time with me"" and ""how ungrateful I was"".  I was so surprised.  I thought we had actually been friends.  Apparently not.

A few years later, he sent me an invitation to his wedding as part of his wedding party and asked me to be a ""groomslady"".  I never responded."

"A guy walked next to me for like two hours when I was in high school. I was~14, he was at least 40.Just silently walked alongside me, I couldn't shake him. At first he made small talk, but when I told him he was making me uncomfortable and told him to leave me alone he fell silent and just followed me. I went into a store and told the manager, and the manager made him leave, but then he just stood outside waiting for me to come out. I called the police, and they told me he hadn't actually done anything wrong and they saw no reason to send an officer. I ended up hiding out in the grocery store for an hour before my brother could come pick me up. I was only a few blocks from home but I didn't want to go there and have him know where I lived. Terrifying, and the cops were 100% unhelpful."

"I still use my student email to access student discounts. I am not a student.

I still wear that dress and my lying ass looks great in it.

Oh and this is not really an intentional hack, more like lying by omission; there was a good 6 months when I kept on getting refunds on my travel card that were not owed to me, and I did not tell the transport company about them. I think I ended up getting around £50 worth of free travel."

"I was because of religion, but wonder if I wasn't religious growing up if I would have had sex before marriage. It's not really in my personality, but I think I would have probably lived with my spouse before getting married. But we're both from the same religion, and were both virgins before getting married. 

I'm actually pretty happy with how everything turned out. I love my husband and it feels wonderful being each other's first for all our fun sexy things, and exploring what we like and don't like together. What I wasn't expecting though was to feel so crappy after having sex the first time on our wedding night. I did everything the right way within my religion, and I still felt like I did something wrong. I was done a disservice in the way I was taught about sex and I think it should change. Sex really isn't that big of a deal, but I was taught sex outside of marriage is a mega sin. Like huge. 

So even though I did things in the right order, I was fighting feeling depressed and worthless having lost my virginity. I didn't feel that way for very long, by the end of my honey moon it was so natural feeling. But I know couples within my religion that struggle with sex because of the way it's taught from a young age. I won't be teaching my children the same thing, because I don't think it's fair."

I mean we like the same shit, and I like these intense feelings."" (False, I don't remember ever having the impression we liked the same things at all.) Then he asked me *why* I was dating someone, tried to convince me to go out with him, because my SO lives so far away anyway, and told me I don't know if I'm polyamorous because I've never been in a polyamorous relationship. Then he whined about how it was a ""shame"" I didn't want to talk to him.

1) she lived on an island cut off from the world. She was culturally stupid, of course she needs someone to show her around, captain America went through the same shit.

2) what the fuck is this mentality that her looking sexy and feminine is Unnecessary and misogynistic! I would argue that this mentality right here is fucking misogynistic. Women don’t need to give u femininity in order I gain respect. Looking good isn’t misogynistic. Are you a women? Do you put makeup and Unnecessary just clothing on for men or do you do it to make yourself feel confident? Most women would say they do it for themselves, myself included. In fact in my opinion it would be more empowering to be as strong as the boys, or anyone for that matter, and not have to give up how I want to look as a feminin girl. This mentality is saying that you can’t be badass AND look hot? You sound like someone who thinks slut shaming is wrong but don’t support sex workers lol"

"Back in undergrad I used to get healthier groceries by ringing up a few items incorrectly at the self-check at Wal-Mart.

Rules were: only ever wal-mart, only produce, and only if its an expensive ingredient that you can't afford otherwise. 

Our Wal-Mart sold a specific type of apple at $0.25/lb - ridiculously cheap for apples. I bought a lot of them, but I also sometimes rang up things like avocados or cauliflower as those apples instead. 

I think stores are more savvy on things like this now, and also I no longer do it because I have money and don't need to, but its one of the reasons I was able to beat the ""freshman 15"". "
"Once upon a time, many, many moons ago, this was me... And then I got sick of it. 

Here's what I did: I watched the people whose dancing I envied, and then I went home, put on music, and tried out what those people did. I worked out what I liked, what I could do, what felt fun. I did it alone, and I did it over and over again. Then I put on my favorite clothes, went to shitty hotel lounge where I knew nobody but the one person who went with me, had a drink, closed my eyes, and *danced my ass off.* I just pretended like it was normal for me - it was practically an acting exercise - and lo and behold, it evidently seemed normal to everybody else. I think I had my eyes closed for at least the first three songs, straight, and when I opened them, there were people dancing with me. Not around me, WITH me. Never looked back. It still takes me a few minutes to work up the nerve to step out there, but now I just remember that ridiculous hotel lounge full of strangers I never saw again, and I do it instead of not doing it."

He broke into my apartment a few months ago, and threatened to kill me, bled all over my bathroom, cut up my clothes, and threatened to shoot me up with heroin because he ""loves me forever and if he can't have me, no one can"". The district attourney is incompetent, the judge didn't know i had even had him arrested, and gave me a 6 month temporary stay-away order. (The 5th one in 4 years) He was arrested for all of 2 months and gets out in 3 days. 

He will not leave me alone, and everybody with half a brain sees that. (This has been going on for 4!!!!! Years now)

He will not leave me alone, and I have to have a police escort from work to my house the day he gets out.

Do i dream about killing him. Pushing him off a bridge, pushing him in front of a car, off my fire escape, stabbing him.

"Well there are people to whom sex just really isn't that important. And if both of them are okay with it I don't really see something bad about it.


I think with today's pressure for everyone to be basically a porn star (Eurpoean talkin here), many people who feel this way wouldn't articulate that openly, because they know they'd be judged.

"I'll add a tip to this. 
Puppy pads are soft disposable waterproof pads about 18"" square. Like a huge flat menstrual pad. You and your baby will be exhausted and leaking from all kinds of strange places. Putting these down during changes in strange places, on the bed if I was nursing on my side, etc.

Michael's idea of humor is actually constant sexual harassment to every woman in the office. Besides Phyllis, because she's old. He's disgusting.

The Jim and Pam storyline really, really bothers me. Before they became a couple, we got to know Pams personality and all of her little quirks. After she was married and having babies with Jim... nothing. She also never got to really follow her own dreams. There was that small period of time when she took the initiative to go to art school, but that went to shit quickly :/

"I have another one:


About 2 years ago Macy's had a killer black Friday deal on a luggage set (around $30-40 for the set.) When it arrived in the mail 2 of the pieces were scratched &amp; slightly damaged. Since they didn't sell that set at my local store, I couldn't just go exchange them, so I emailed Macy's CS, and sent them pics, hoping they would send me new ones after I returned the damaged set. Well they said they couldn't send me new ones for the black Friday price, and the best solution would be for me to return the damaged set, then they'd refund my money, and then I could repurchase it (for the higher price.) I was **PISSED!** 

So I just said F-it. I never responded to that email, and I figured I'd just keep the damaged luggage. I mean it was still a good deal for what I paid. Then a couple days later, I'm looking at my bank account online (for something unrelated) and I see there's been a full refund posted to my bank account for the Macy's order.


Why on earth would they refund me the money **before** I returned the item?!?! I tossed and turned every night in bed the next few weeks wondering if I should do the right thing, and go take that luggage back to Macy's

....

"Woman with BP2/severe depression and I swear my SO is an angel in disguise. He is the most loving, patient man I've ever met.

Some things he does that make me feel supported when I am down:

* Always listens. Even when it's the same story he's heard 100 times. He gives me a space where I don't feel judged or a nuisance to just let the feelings wash over me and lets me know he'll be there through it and when it's over.

* Calls me out on my bullshit. If there's an obvious solution to a problem, he will get frustrated if I play victim too long or don't take his advice. Sometimes I need him to get mad to realize I need to try harder to snap out of it.

* If we're out and about, we always have an escape plan (uber/drive ourselves) so if I get burnt out we can just go back home and cuddle/watch a movie.

* Just genuinely loves me. I never have to worry about scaring him off or draining him because the way he looks at and communicates with me is always from a positive space. He never, ever tries to make me feel bad about myself."

It was cold and wet, so I said sure. Asshole proceeded to drive me to the middle of nowhere and tell me we were going to have sex whether I wanted it or not. I then grabbed his keys in the ignition, stomped hard on the gas and gunned it for the edge of the nearby cliff telling him I'd die first and take him with me if he didn't give me a ride home. And I meant it - 15-year-old me was fiery as fuck. 

He drove me home after that complaining all the way about how a ""nice guy"" like him never catches a break. I gave his name to a few male friends and my older brother and he ran the other way every time he saw me after that. "

"Yeah I've noticed this as well mediocre to below average dudes wanting flawless and very attractive women while not meeting those qualifications themselves.

I believe this expectation is behind a lot of the incel and foreveralone stuff floating around out there now.

Dudes growing up with unreal images of female beauty in media expect the average girl to look like that as well and are disappointed when they don't or the ones that do meet those standards aren't interested in them for obvious reasons.

Its quite interesting to observe because many men in my peer group display these behaviors and are bitter because of it.

Getting with a girl who is pretty but average or not perfect is seen as settling."
My grandma used to be really abusive. She would wake us up at 4 am to water the grass because it looked bad and it was our job to maintain it. Well that was news to us. She made up random jobs for us frequently. My sister and I noticed she made the same hand and body movements when she said her popular phrases “Do you think I’m stupid” and a few others. We made a dance that incorporated her movements with the phrases. So every time she yelled at me my sister would go behind her and do the dance we made up. I also did the same. It’s been over a decade. We still do it. 
"I told him I wasn't interested. He let it go for a few weeks, then tried to pressure me into going on a date (in a ""joking"" manner, of course), to which I declined.

"I once ordered an item of clothing to my apartment. It was delivered, but I couldn't find the package in my apartment mailroom.

"These feelings can turn into a self fulfilling prophecy. 

Often people who don't feel worthy of their partner's love and affection begin acting badly to their partner as a form of self sabotage. The idea of - you can't really be interested in me - you deserve better than me- infiltrates your actions and actively drives the person away. If you work against his growth you will become something negative in his life- your goal as his partner should be to support his development and he should support you.

Y'all are married, he chose you- you chose each other. Find a way to accept his love and fight your own feelings of inadequacy.  If you do feel he is growing in a positive way- be supportive and work on growing with him.

Seek some counseling to help you shift your perceptions of yourself, and work to ensure that you continue to be a positive piece of your husbands life."
"I used to do porn, and the women took at least 24 hours to prepare. What they ate, what they drank, water enemas before hand, etc. 

Almost all directors cut before the anal and the actress would spend 20-30 minutes alone on the bathroom, cleaning, using toys, possibly drinking, taking muscle relaxers, rubbing coke in their butthole for the numbing effects, etc. 

Anal is not something people just jump into at a moments notice. 

It could take one to two days for an actress to prepare. 

Also, in porn they cut it to look like you can go from the ass to the vagina. 

YOU CANNOT DO THAT!!!!

You will end up at the doctors with vaginitis, etc. a dick can’t go from the ass to the vagina without infections happening. 

It makes me sad when I look back. It’s like reverse sex ed. where they teach everything NOT to do :("
"They don't think about how they'd feel if someone did that to them because it doesn't even occur to them that someone would ever do something to sexually violate them.

"and you ask them and it's like ""Oh that's just my ridiculously, hot single friend Sarah who I go to everything with."" "
"I disagree. In the original fairy tale, the reason the Beast imprisons Maurice is for stealing the rose after the Beast was gracious enough to open the castle to Maurice and provide him and his horse with food and rest. The roses are the Beast's absolute prize item above all else. Is imprisoning someone for life over a flower overreacting? Definitely. But the Beast is a spoiled brat royal. 

Belle *chooses* to take her Father's place. The Beast does not come and take her. Also, I wouldn't go so far as to say abuse. I've seen abuse. He has two anger fits in the movie and one is absolutely justified. Belle could have destroyed any chance of the castle's return to humanity. Bearing that in mind, one meltdown from a boy who is used to getting his way is not abuse. It's bratty. The Beast is selfish and terrible in the beginning because that is all he knows and he has been spoiled and used to getting his way his whole life. Learning how to be a better person is possible. Learning to care about someone is possible. That's why true love breaks the spell, because it means that the Beast has learned his lesson and become a better person than he was. "

"On pooping: this may seem like an unusual perspective, but as a microbiologists poop from a mother during childbirth is a wonderful thing. Exposure to the vaginal canal and poop are the first opportunity for the baby to be introduced and colonized with healthy microbes that will protect their baby from infection and kick start development until they start making their own immune ssystem at 6 months old (assuming the mother doesn't have an infection). It is so important that doctors are considering protocols of swabbing newborns delivered via c-section with vaginal and rectal swabs from the mother so their babies don't miss out on these essential microbial communities."

"A few years back, after my husband and I split, I did a little online dating by way of OKcupid. I was brand new to the whole online dating thing and honestly quite naive to the culture. Needless to say I made some rookie mistakes. 
&amp;nbsp;
This guy ends up sending me a relatively innocuous message about how he likes my profile, but I'm probably too much of an extrovert for him, but he'd be remiss if he didn't at least say hello. So I take a look at his profile aaaaaaand total neck-beard. Not really my type. I send him a polite message back that basically says, that I appreciated his kind words, and also, yeah, not really interested. 
&amp;nbsp;
So he sends me back, what I thought at the time was, a very sweet message about how obviously we weren't romantically compatible, but how cool he thought some of the things I'd said on my profile were. He had a few follow up comments about things he also liked and questions about why I liked this that or the other thing. 
&amp;nbsp;
Somehow I ended up talking to this guy for hours via text. All of it perfectly polite conversation. He didn’t really flirt with me at all. He even asked me if I'd had any luck on OKcupid, which lead me to tell him all about a guy that I had been seeing casually. He offered some really good advice and was honestly a perfect gentleman.  
&amp;nbsp;
So we start chatting online on a somewhat regular basis. He continued to be polite and maybe a little flirty, but not overtly so. I didn’t have very many male friends at the time and it was nice to get a guy perspective on some of the things going on in my life. I genuinely thought I’d made a friend. 
&amp;nbsp;
Fast-forward a couple of week. I had recently moved into a new apartment, but needed to pick up a few last items from my old place. A book shelf and a recliner and a handful of other odd &amp; ends. I mention this offhandedly to my new internet friend and he insists that he come help me. 
&amp;nbsp;
I very nearly didn’t agree to it, but up until that point he had been such a gentleman and hadn’t given me any reason to think he was going to turn out to be a psychopath. I also really did need some help and here he was offering to do all my heavy lifting for me. I still wasn’t sure if it was a good idea, but after some back and forth I finally agreed to let him help me.
&amp;nbsp;
So I pick him up, as it turns out he doesn’t drive. I also discover that he is living with a “friend” whose kids he babysits in exchange for room &amp; board. He was homeless, just a few month back and had been living on the streets for quite some time before that. He is on disability. He’s also missing a lot of his teeth.
&amp;nbsp;
I’m trying really hard not to be too judgmental. He still seems very sweet in person. He’s also rather afeminant and somewhat whinny which is annoying. So we make some small talk and things start out fine except he’s making a lot of comments like, “Oh! You’re even prettier in person than I imagined,” or, “Oh, I always wanted a girlfriend that was tall like you.”  
&amp;nbsp;
We head out to my old place. As promised he helps me take apart some furniture and loads it up in my Subaru. We head back to my place and he helps me unload the car,  all the while continuing to shower me in compliments that make me feel uncomfortable and calling me (you guessed it) M’lady. 
&amp;nbsp;
After everything is moved, he insists on making me dinner. I probably would have refused if he hadn’t brought all of the fixings with him and also I’m hungry, so I let him whip up some of the worst chicken I’ve ever tasted in my life. Then things start to get weird. My roommate comes home with a movie and he wants to watch it with us. I feel like a dick rushing him out the door after he helped me move and cook dinner. Then he wants to give me a backrub, which I decline and give him a shoulder rub instead, because he’s starting to creep me out and I want control of the situation. After the movie I take him home immediately and not more than an hour later he starts sending me all these whinny texts.
&amp;nbsp;
He starts out by saying that he’s really upset that we didn’t get to hang out at all. And I’m like, wtf are you talking about. We literally just spent the whole day together. Which is when he claimed that I didn’t give him any attention. I still didn’t know what he was talking about and I told him so. We hung out all day. What else did you want?
&amp;nbsp;
He starts talking about how he’s crazy about me and I can’t possible understand what it’s like to have met your soulmate and have them not be interested in you. He can’t understand why I don’t want to be with him. I told him I thought we were friends. I thought he understood that I am not looking for a relationship. So then he asks if we couldn’t be friends with benefits. He said he knew that I was “into casual sex” and couldn’t understand why I didn’t want to at least have sex with him. He went on to call me shallow because he was not, “traditionally attractive.” 
&amp;nbsp;
So I basically told him, to a certain extent, he was right. I typically only have casual sex with people I find drop dead gorgeous. To me, that is the point of casual sex. To fuck beautiful people. However, when I am interested in dating someone, I am less concerned with looks. I want someone with a great personality, who is ambitious, or at the very least, has their shit together. You have no job, no car, no house, no career goals, no ambition, nothing. I have no reason to fuck or date you.    
&amp;nbsp;
Well, that pretty much shut him up. He said he didn’t want to be my friend and I said fine by me. Of course he’d “accidentally” left some shit at my house and needed to get it back from me. I said, “l’ll put in on the porch.” It was gone the next day and thankfully I never heard from him again.

"&gt;Some women here seem to think that a vagina is streched out by several penises or something. Thats not how it works. Having a child probably will, but not the amount of penises. 

It's a weird cultural concept that people carry. 

Like, if a woman had sex with only one guy, but she was with him, living together for ten years, she will likely have had far more sex than a woman who sleeps with 100 guys in 10 years. 

And that's to say nothing of the potential size of the partner's penis. "

"My boss texted me at 4am that morning saying I didn't have to come in. He is slightly conservative, but not at all rubbing my face in it, just showing genuine sympathy because he knew I'd be devastated. "
Peter Dinklage. I've loved him since The Station Agent.
"I get Hopper. He IS sexy. I like lazy, sarcastic Hopper and badass Hopper, and I like that they exist in the same brain."
"Hey, I'm one of those families! I'm doing my best to only watch things that deserve to exist. 

Mostly Bob's Burgers, honestly. "
Because of the implication. 
"One for controlling and possessive. He lashed out about something minor, and thought I should apologize for it. I stopped hanging out with him.

One had everyone stop inviting me places, but I didn't mind because I didn't really fit in that group anyway."
"Him: ""I like the whole Olive Oyl look you've got going on.""
Me: ""The TinTin thing suits you as well. ""
Him: ""Fuck you! Look around! It's not like you're the hottest chick in the bar, I'm do you a favour here!"" "
"When I didn't see him for two weeks and realized I was happier and more relaxed without him around, and didn't miss him for one minute of those two weeks."
Don't you know? You should be properly turned on enough for penetration just from sucking his dick for 20 minutes.
BREAKING: Horrible Man Continues To Be Horrible
Not coming home to someone else's mess after a 12 hour shift.
"My mom gave birth three times. When they gave her the baby, right after birth, she didn't know what to do with it. She didn't like the baby, since she just gave birth and that hurts! The midwife (that's what it's called, right? I'm Dutch, it's a bit different here) saw her face, smiled, and told her that it's okay not to like your baby right after. A lot of mothers have this but no one says it because they feel ashamed. She felt the same way all three times, with my brothers and me. She loves us to death, but it took her a couple minutes to even like us. It didn't make her a bad mother whatsoever, so don't worry if you have the same experience. You just pushed out a baby, it's okay to not be very fond of the one that hurt you immediately. If it persists though, find help. Don't be ashamed."
"When he got hard from a hug.

To this day, four years later, I still loooove when that happens."
"I wanted to make limoncello while watching the Comey Senate testimony.

So, I called out sick. And I watched the testimony while zesting 30 organic lemons and triple-filtering three bottles of Everclear."
They don't think it be like it is but it do 
"Their age difference was icky for sure. As was, imo, Monica and Richards... He was her parents' friend and he knew her as a child and she peed in his pool and was friends with her daughter. Yucky yucky"
"Same. I'm a Gen Xer who found herself single several years ago and went on a spree of sorts. The decade-younger partners were...not good. My young female friends' experiences square with mine: a complete disinterest in a woman's pleasure, sometimes an interest in her displeasure, a seeming pride in that, as though it were a badge of masculinity, total ignorance of anatomy, contempt for safer sex practices. I can't chalk it up to inexperience, because sex in my 20s with men close to my age was mostly very mutually enjoyable. I feel so sad for so many younger people...sex is supposed to be fun, not something to endure like a gladiator. Why the hell are so many dudes glued to material that teaches them to be unfuckable?"
"But everyone KNOWS Michael is a creep. In the early seasons when he is really awful they all openly hate him. Yes he is creepy and sexist and harassing, but you can't say the show is because of that.

And I've always had mixed feelings about Jim and Pam. I think he is kind of a jerk. And it's not fair that he got to take that sports job (which he ended up giving up for her!), but I don't think it's right to say that we stopped learning about Pam. As she had kids her life did become more about her kids. That actually happens and a lot of women and men enjoy that! But she was still working on her art. She did at least two murals and we can assume she continued to look for other opportunities as well. 

I um like talking about The Office haha."
"My university system would just change sticker style instead of putting dates or anything on the sticker. I quit and returned a few years later. They were using the same sticker style I had on my car, so I got a year of free parking. "
"This is a video that explains the ""adorkable misogyny"" in The Big Bang Theory. They are male characters whose nerdy version of masculinity comes across as adorable and likeable. Because they are actually ""nice guys,"" they are let off the hook for a number of creepy and sexist behaviours.

That's....not right. But it sure fits the thread! 
"Married with Children. Over half the jokes are Al insulting women based on their weight, and the rest of them are him insulting women based on other qualities (talking too much, having small breasts, looking like a chicken, etc.) or just bashing his wife. "
"We also virtually never go out for dinner or buy fast food. Many of my daughter's friends get a shock when they see our fridge. They've never seen a fridge filled with perishables.

In contrast, my kid gets shocked visiting her friends. Open the fridge and the only thing in there is sodas and condiments (ketchup, mayo, mustard, etc)."
"He went out with me one time, insisted on paying for our meal while not hiding his disbelief at the cost (which was not exaggerated at all, it was just a pizza place) and planned out our lives together.

Because of said date he assumed we were together and stalked me for the following year or so, before deciding he was actually in love with one of my closest friends and doing the same thing to her."
You stop giving a shit about a lot of things. That’s my favourite bit so far. 
"Hocus Pocus! Every year, without fail."
"I don’t understand the hostility towards men in some of the responses, but it could be as simple as they’re looking for a female perspective to understanding their relationship."
