"So you kissed your friend's wife, got busted, and now feel remorse.  Pretty natural reaction, but...
You're worried about being a catalyst for their divorce, which you can't control.  But if I were in your position, my concern would be discovering that I'm the type of ""friend"" and self serving person that would make out with my buddy's wife while he's barely 10 feet away.  That, you can control.  Not trying to bash on you dude, and I'm sure you already feel bad.  This is an opportunity to figure out why you aren't acting like the ""good"" person you likely see yourself as being. "
"Daughter: sorry I made a big mess.         
Dad: hold me beer."
This is the dumbest thing Ive ever read
"Wow, interesting to see a post here that's not just some kooky misunderstanding but someone actually just doing something terrible and getting caught."
$100 to a 5 year old might as well be a million! You just boosted his APM by 1000 and gave him God mode! Glad you kept your word and paid up! Bet the little guy is stoked!
"The guy was threatening to fight you. You shouldn't have said those things, but it's hard to see how you were in the wrong when this guy showed up and started threatening you.

If I were you I'd just stick to my guns and say that you were just trying to stop this girl from taking all the candy in your bowl instead of just a few, and that her dad started physically threatening you because you wouldn't let her take it all. I'd emphasize the fact that he was physically threatening you. And maybe apologize for using any foul language, but that you were reacting loudly because you were being threatened."
"It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this? It was only a kiss...."
"I hope something good came of it.  Like it ended up being serendipitous and either saved your marriage or freed you both.  Either way, best of luck dear TIFUer.  "
"and now you know where ""Fur Elise"" came from."
I mean it seems like you're into being humiliated so congrats?
"I hire folks all the time. The person who asked you to leave is an idiot. 
When you show up to an interview, we expect you to be nervous. If s/he was any good AT ALL, they would’ve asked about the back &amp; paid attention to your response. They could’ve learned a LOT about how you react to stress and potential setbacks, and I guarantee that insight is way more valuable (like- immeasurably more) than whatever thing you wrote on the questionnaire. "
Rip that bandaid off dude. Either work through the issues or move on now.
And now you’re looking for that bastard that was trying to get rid of a 2” nail!
Oh my god that fucking sucks. Props to you for dealing with it though. Like there was any alternative but still.

Better than the guy who applied to jobs all over the place only to learn he markes himself as retarted on every application
Actually laughed out loud at this one!
It's been pretty nice hanging out by myself. 
What a way to start a Sunday. I'll bet today will be fun.
I’m glad he won’t be bugging you any more.

"I imagine a parallel universe where the scenario unfolds this way:

""Hello.  I'd like to return this jacket and hat that I found left behind at the parade yesterday.""

""Oh, thank you very much."""
"Thanks to my wife for dealing with my daughter's emotional distress. I can handle the other messes, but you're right, it sucked. Fortunately, our kids rarely get sick. Fingers crossed that the rest of us avoid her plague, too."
"My god man. I'm sorry, but I can't stop laughing at you. "
"You've likely just increased his appetite for money my 1000%. I survived most of high school on 20 bucks a month, this kid will eventually be asking for bailout packages "

"Your comment is hinting at what I think is the truth behind this post. 

OP is into being humiliated, so he imagines completely humiliating scenarios. Not quite doing it for him anymore, needs to find a way to be more humiliated. ""Ah, what if I post the most humiliating thing I can imagine in a public place where thousands of people will see it!"" 

TL;DR: OP is using Reddit to masturbate in a much more elaborate way than the rest of you."
"&gt;  Apparently he's got this down to a science.

Understatement of the week right here folks."
"Damn. Moral: always put a note.

"
It was only a kiss!
"As a person who gets hired by folks, I wish more recruiters has your attitude. So many are overly concerned with superficial things.

For example, I once lost out on a job mostly due to asking what they meant by ""dashboard"". They had shown me a printout of an Excel sheet, but I didn't have access to the actual file to be able tell if it was connected to anything via VLOOKUP or macro, or whether it was just an aggregate report. So I asked ""What exactly do you mean by dashboard?"" The reason I asked was because, at the time, I was a Systems Analyst in the IT department of this company, and there dashboard referred to the main UI that presented information in our ERP system.

They balked at this and said ""I don't know if we could hire someone who doesn't know what a dashboard is"". I tried explaining that the term means different things in different fields, and that while this looked like a summary report, I would also be working with live systems and didn't know if they meant the dashboard in the system that would generate a report, it the report itself. The whole rest of the interview was just them being really impressed by something, and then saying ""but I don't know if we could have someone that doesn't know a dashboard is do this job.""

TL;DR - Lost a job because I asked for clarification on an ambiguous that has different meanings to different departments, even within the same company."
"Hindsight is twenty twenty after all, but could've just said u were brushing ur teeth and it lost its shit and u didn't want to wake everyone up. Funny story though. Good luck with whatever comes of it. "
Agreed. This might be the only way to address the problems. It forces you to talk. I REALLY hope that they take this opportunity and it works out well for them. THIS COULD BE A BLESSING IN DISGUISE OP. IM ROOTING FOR YOU. 
Dude it sounds like you need some understanding kinky friends lol 
I've heard about and seen a lot of dumb things in my lifetime. This honestly may take the cake. 
I bet she was udderly upset with you. 
"I agree. It's a shame when the parents behave as badly or worse than the kids. The parent could have 'manned up' and had a 'teachable moment' and taught his kid to not be greedy..... ""hey look, they're being nice and giving out the *big* candy bars, it's the right thing to do to only take one and make sure other people get to have one too -- after all, most places only let you have two small pieces, and that's not nearly the same thing!""

.... but *nooo.....* dad had to be a bigger brat than his crotchfruit... hopefully all you get is a smack on the wrist. 

Offer to do some community service around campus picking up trash or something, to show you weren't intending to be mean, you were only intending to make sure that one kid wasn't going to be a hog and keep the others from being able to have some fun too. *AND* be sure to mention that if you participate in another similar event... you'll make sure to hand out treats personally, to ensure fairness, so there is no chance of such happening again.

All you can do is everything you can to show 

a. it was not intentional or malicious

b. you learned some things of what to do better and different ways to handle such in the future

Wow this song kinda fits in nicely until the bridge."
That is the single most insanely idiotic thing I have ever read. We are all dumber now for having read it.

"Hmm... Before our son was birn, we talked about names. I liked jonah, but as I touched her belly and ask him do you like the name? He also was in a whale, that name was no longer an option for my wife."
Dude If I was your friend I would have found that incredibly funny rather than disgusting. I probably wouldn't let you live that down after taking a picture before releasing you. Hahaha

"The worst part for me, and I REALLY sympathize with OP, but think about all the bar locals, who have seen this go down week after week, rolling their eyes when the scrawny piano guy right on queue at exactly 10:15pm says “I’d like to play you something I just wrote...” but they all watch intently because the pool says whoever guesses which word she’s going to swoon over wins free drinks. Daily double pays out if she slaps him and going home together  is “final round”.

"Neither of us has brought it up since. As fast as I can tell, she does not know that I know.  I'll keep you guys posted on how this unfolds!"
lol I didn't know wether to laugh or cry whenever I left the shop.
"Well OP maybe you shouldn't have been such a fucking prick and housewreck that shit.

 He rightfully kicked your ass but the divorce I think might've been a bit too over the top. But hey its their relationship. Lastly, it takes two to tango so not all of it is your fault too. And alcohol can do things to people: they don't think about the consequences I'm sure if you were sober you'd never even think about kissing her. Don't beat yourself up too much... learn from this mistake and NEVER try and kiss/fuck a friend's SO in the future UNLESS you willingly wanna fuck up everything you built with that said person.

There’s a Russian proverb that goes “don’t dig a hole for another as you might just fall into it yourself”.

Then she realized her fault and left the car without saying anything about this embarrassing situation. Shortly after getting into the right car of her husband (two cars in front), the man from the other car came to her window, knocked and showed her her lost handbag."
"There’s also a Reddit proverb that goes “don’t throw stuff in a tornado ‘cause that’s a whole new level of dangerous, and it’s also stupid as fuck”"
Just moo at her tonight and you're good.
"Alright, we needs them dets. What happened? "
Friend probably thought you weren't really stuck and just wanted to expose yourself to her.  Would explain the attitude and such. 
"I'm a sty@home Dad. Been that way since the beginning. I may not be a master at my daughter's hair, but most other things like cooking, cleaning, laundry, house &amp; yard maintenance, kid shuttling, dr.'s and dentist's appts., PTO club meetings &amp; teacher contacts, finances, etc., I can definitely hold my own. My son's almost 10 now, but I cannot remember a time when anyone ever accused me of babysitting. I think the older generations might think it's a bit strange for the wife to work and the husband to stay home, but everyone else seems to just mind their own business (thankfully). I'm glad we worked it this way because the wife and I agree that we both excel in our respective positions. She doesn't manage kids well and I'm a corporate burnout. 

Good luck to you, fellow rockstar!"

"Turn this around on them.  My dorms had ID card swipers at the entry ways, assuming yours is similar?  You're paying a shitton for that kind of security.  And what...

This person threatened to fight you, the resident, in front of his children.  What were they doing to make sure you were safe?  Do you know he wasn't armed?  Did the school do anything to make sure of that?

"I used to dabble with a bit of self-bondage until one night I tied myself spread-eagled to my bed and realised I couldn't get out.

"This is a huge red flag that you do not want to work there.  A job search goes both ways - I stopped an interview that was going well at a company I thought I really wanted to work for when I saw a noteboard covered with petty and pedantic ""do's and don'ts"". A short time later I landed a great job following an interview I went into just to get some interview practice."
"Actually... You just put it back in the bathroom and try to sleep. If someone comes in, just say that it started acting up in the middle of the night"
"My parents used to hang a picture frame with $200 in it in the hallway. Whenever my sister or myself got nothing but As in the four main classes, we'd get the money. It was a great incentive walking past that money everyday on my way to school as a 13 year old"

"I once told my son I'd give him $10 if he could hold his breath all the way across a specific (several km long) toll bridge.  About a month later, we were on a plane, about to land at our local airport, and I stupidly pointed out that same toll bridge to him right before we flew over it (from side to side, not end to end). He grinned, held his breath for about 2 seconds, and told me, ""You owe me $10, dad."" Yes, I paid up. I was pretty proud too, despite feeling kind of foolish. I'm glad it wasn't $100."

"hi hopefully you see this - I used to work for Stubhub. Call them - explain you're a first time user and didn't realize this wasn't something you could refund/cancel  - they SHOULD be able to waive the selling fees for you. I did it all the time for purchases exactly like this. shit happens. 


Two: Check your fees on when you bought them. Stubhub makes their money on fees, since they don't sell the tickets. They might be able to work with you on refunding your ""buy fees"" as well, or even partially so you can lower the price of your tickets. (This is a super courtesy and they may not do it. But if you're nice and you ask - it could happen.) 


Three: Closer to the event prices will usually drop IF there's a lot of inventory. If not? prices will jump. Aim high and then gradually go down. See how others are selling, if the site still works as it did when I worked there, it should be able to tell you what tickets have sold for in that same section for that show. I always used to tell people that you can always lower it. Selling in pairs is common. 


Four: I worked in the US. But the policy should be the same across the board - seriously call them. 

I hope you see this !"
"Well, I had the talk with her.  And yes, she had read it.  It was actually a little anticlimactic.  It turns out that our situation could more or less be summed up in the song Pina Colada.  

But after talking it over, we decided that we're going to stick it out for the time being and stay living together for the sake of our children."
"I assume, ""Who the fudge are you?"" As she would never curse. "

"I was picking up my wife from her community symphony choir practice one night at the high school where the choir rented rehearsal space. It was dark and raining and as I pulled up a teenage girl kind of darted in front of my wife and opened the passenger door. Before she could get in though I gruffly said, ""wrong car!"" She jumped back and shrieked a little before running back under the awning.

My wife thought it was hilarious and still jokes about me trying to pick up teenage girls but instead scaring them off."
Tickets are most expensive on the secondary market at the time the event sells out and generally decline in price until the concert. Can often snag some great deals if you buy tickets the day or the concert because people get desperate to sell

"Yeah, the dudes first mistake was assuming 100 dollars to his son would be just as great an incentive as 100 dollars to himself.

"You betrayed your friend, it is possible to fix such a fuck up though, depending on how forgiving your friend is but it may take many years. If he was in love with her then it's gonna hurt him A LOT. All you can do is plead, beg and apologise profusely at the moment. The wifes infidelity has been uncovered though, which I suppose is a silver lining.. better to find out sooner rather than later in life. When I was a boy, I betrayed my friend in a similar situation and I still feel guilty for it.. we did manage to make amends eventually though. It changed me as a person and I developed a deep moral centre. Learn from it."
"Well like I said, I *was* working there in a different department. As a contractor, granted, but even still. 

It ended up working out in the end with the guy who left and made the position open returning and getting rehired, only to continue doing bad work.

So in the end, I had all the dashboards. :)"
