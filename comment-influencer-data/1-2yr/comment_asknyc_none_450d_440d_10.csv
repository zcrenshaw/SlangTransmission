"As someone who picks up garbage for a living this is my two cents. 

First off, we do have machinery that goes around cleaning everything up (mostly the curb line where garbage collects) they are [mechanical brooms](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IaDe5thjpGA/maxresdefault.jpg). I personally enjoy driving it, especially when I look back and see how clean the curb line becomes. I live in this city and I want it to be clean. I'm proud to be able to do my part. 

In some neighborhoods, they do have MLP (mobile litter patrols) who go around cleaning messes off the streets. 

Corner baskets are great, but they aren't supposed to be used for household or business refuse. They are meant for cans and bottles and chip bags, and the container from which you just ate your Halal. However, many people instead use them for household and business trash. this takes up the baskets real estate, and before long it's over flowing. I saw a guy the other day, exit a storage unit and proceed to break up an old medicine cabinet and throw it into a corner basket. If a super saw it, he could get a ticket. However, supers and san cops can't be everywhere at once. Some places we find baskets stuffed with car parts, and people continue throwing stuff in, so before long it's spilling onto the sidewalk. 

When I do baskets in some neighborhoods, people will simply drop whatever they want around the cans. I once tossed an electric scooter someone left by the can, into my truck. Boxes, kitty litter, childrens toys, uncovered mattresses (which normally have to be covered, but if they don't cover it, they leave it by a corner basket where they know it'll be collected and won't risk them a ticket). You name it, people leave it in, or next to a basket. 

NYC is also one of the most wasteful cities in the world. We produce so much trash, because we are a disposable culture. I regularly throw out perfectly good food, furniture, electronics etc. There is no system in place to say: ""hey instead of tossing that, how about we fix it? or donate it?"" When I find full cans and bottles of food, I hand them to homeless people, when I can. 
 
Honestly, it really comes down to the people. When you see somebody throw their chip bag on the sidewalk, do you say something? I tried once and also got into a fight. Our streets are dirty because people aren't taught to love and respect the city. If you go to Rockaway Queens, the streets are spotless. People love the community and clean up after themselves. Then go to 13th Ave in Brooklyn, where the streets are caked in litter. People there simply don't care. done with your drink? toss it in the street. Done eating? leave the bag on the sidewalk. Look how often people let their dog poo and pee on the sidewalk and won't pick it up. I walk around looking down, as to not step in poo or pee. why is it so hard to clean up after your dog??? "
"When devotion to your religion is above everything else in your life, being uncomfortable is irrelevant."
"Spraying them with a wayer gun would be harassment at best.  Battery does not exist in New York penal law, and assault only occurs when a physical injury results.  You wouldn’t get arrested for this.

However you need to consider the repercussions of this.  If you went after these people personally, you could create an uncomfortable situation for yourself with your neighbors, and you might start looking over your shoulder whenever you’re outside.  I don’t suggest you do this.

The best course of action is to use NYC’s 311 system to make reports.  If the police respond and then the guys come back, put in another report.  Rinse and repeat.  The smokers will get tired of being bothered and will find a new place to hang out.  Also, getting multiple 311 complaints for a single location will trigger a flag where an NYPD supervisor will be required to respond as well, and if the complaints continue to pile up, the precinct concerned will start sending officers there in advance to keep the area clean.

In short, report to 311, and keep reporting until the situation is corrected.  Using a water gun, while not necessarily illegal, will put you in potential danger."
"Last month on the M, packed train. Older Indian guy leans his entire back against the pole ON TOP of everyone’s hands. I’m still in recovery."
"Drunk Dude was being racist to this guy and the guy on the receiving end of the racism waited until the doors were open to head butt the racist off the train. Like, soccer style head butt to the center of the chest. It was INCREDIBLE. "
"I do a ton of fast casual takeout. But I pick it up in the restaurant. I can’t stand the unreliability of delivery. Also it costs less (less tip, no delivery fee) and it gives me an excuse to walk outside."
"I mean, these people are high and know where you live, is this wise?!"
"Honestly, not a positive view. While doing animal rescue work in hascidic neighborhoods, on nyc public property, ive been harassed by shomrim and local residents multiple times who acted like i was a trespasser in ""their"" neighborhood. Every time i have been called out to deal with out-of-control feral colonies in hascidic neighborhoods, as I'm doing my rescue work, crowds of people gather around me, like uncomfortably close (im talking like 1-2 feet away from me) and stare at me like I'm a fucking UFO that crash landed on the sidewalk. They all stare and talk about me as if i wasnt standing *right there*. Its so creepy and rude. And when they do talk to me, it's always to ask me with deep suspicion what I'm *really* doing, bc helping animals is apparently unfathomable? The shomrim accused me of using animal rescue as a cover to case the neighborhood to pick houses to rob. Its baffling, im a small, unassuming, completely normal looking young woman, theres no reason for these sorts of interactions to have happened. 

I also am disgusted by the yearly kaporos celebration in which tens of thousands of live animals are put through unbelievable suffering on nyc streets, in the name of religion. The idea that one can cleanse themselves of sin through brutality towards animals, to me that idea is not only outrageously repugnant, its down right sociopathic. 

I do not judge individuals merely on the basis of their religion, so i do not have hate in my heart for hascids. But i do disagree with the type of extremely segregated culture they propagate, it seems very unhealthy for people to be raised in such sheltered, isolated worlds. Theres a lot of troubling issues that plague religiously isolated communities, and the backlash we see against those in the hascidic community who speak up about abuse, it is very alarming to see backlashes against victims. Makes it hard to see the community in a positive manner. "
"Citizen to see why I'm hearing sirens, Citymapper to see why my train is delayed"
"I feel like this question is only useful if you specify what kind of burger it is you're looking for, or at least if people specify what type of burger they're recommending. I'm literally never going to enjoy a burger with a thick 1/2 pound patty, no matter how good it is. That's just not an appealing consistency to me, and there's no way to have a good bread/cheese/meat/garden/sauces ratio.

I'm pretty big into shake shack style burgers. (I am not saying that shake shack makes the best burger in NYC, but I like the general consistency and construction of the burger)"
Probably because of the piss.
"The whole Blue Lives Matter created in response to Black Lives Matter is a joke. Black Lives Matter is not about discrediting cops, it's about drawing attention to the lives of people murdered senselessly by trigger happy, scared, and sometimes racist police officers. There's nothing wrong with wanting cops do to be just, fair, and to do their jobs correctly. Also, the culture of covering for and up for bad cops needs to stop."
"Around 2:30 AM I walk down to the G platform at court square, there’s feathers all over the tracks and platform, a dude is standing in the empty car looking bewildered, and there’s a burning mess on the floor. Turns out he had fallen asleep on the train and someone else had *lit the corner of his jacket on fire* 

The cops showed up like 5 minutes later, we were all ushered into the next train and the police caught the arsonist a few hours after that.

TL;dr - a burning Canada goose coat smells like peanut butter when it burns. "
"I’ll put it to you this way, if I was in Montreal and got a parking ticket with the wrong number on the plate I would leave and let the problem work itself out. "
"Yes they exist, people *used* to rezone old factories into lofts but they haven’t in a decade or so due to changes in the law. Look at the looms or mckibbin in Brooklyn or the clock tower in Mott haven, tribeca and soho are full of lofts but most are condos at this point."
"Absolutely, as long as you do it as an act of charity. Its illegal to \*sell\* a swipe.

Finding a nearly non stop line of sidewalk building scaffolds to your destination when it’s pouring 
"Now that they aren’t denying anyone the bathroom there’s probably a ton of people going in to them to bathe or shoot up or whatever. This isn’t me speculating, it’s just what happens in an urban retail setting. Somebody will go in there for an hour and basically perform an outpatient operation. And when it’s all fucked up you put up the out of order sign because you can’t let anyone else go in there and it will take an hour to clean. Or you need protective equipment to clean. 

I’m not even arguing with the policy, but it comes with a trade off. "
"Cost is bus, comfort is train, speed is plane."
"Seriously.  The list is like: hotels, nice bars, library branches, department stores, Chipotles and Shake Shacks (Wahlburgers if you're at Coney Island), dive bars, Penn and/or Grand Central Station, basement of Rockefeller Center,  in between cars on a dark street, juice bar, indie coffee shop, Starbucks. "
"&gt; Is it a conservative position to appreciate law enforcement?

Yes, because ""appreciate law enforcement"" is a dogwhistle for ""justify consistent overt racism and brutality from law enforcement"", which is not generally something people who value human lives do.

&gt; Is black lives matter a mainstream liberal position?

It's not necessarily mainstream, but it is certainly liberal, because in the US, being against bigotry and police brutality are positions that are consistently NOT supported by conservatives."
"It's because people piss in them. Yes, the homeless will do so often, but so will Tyler the finance bro after one too many overpriced IPAs after the bars close and so do the fashion bloggers' pet labradoodles. We got a lotta bodies in a little space, sometimes it stinks. "
"As a neighbour, I'd appreciate that kind of interaction lot.

However, make sure you're doing this to genuinely get their input, and not just to say you're sorry to get a peace of mind. If they say that the noise *is* bothering them, you'll need to accept that and work on a solution (turn down the bass/volume, add sound insulating material to the floors). If you're not prepared for that response, then you're not really *asking*."
"Not your plate, not your car. "
"The clothes are made to be very light. Like very very light. It's similar to how people who live I nthe desert have lots of clothes on, they're usually incredibly thin cloth. The hats, well, there's not much to be done there, but in general the clothes are made to be as comfortable as possible, usually by hasidic tailors who take this into account."
"I was stuck in a train for an hour and a half between stops because there was someone on the tracks. We saw said person running around on either side of the train with the authorities chasing him around on the tracks. Eventually they caught him and the train got moving, but everybody was an hour and a half late for wherever they were headed. 

The other worst thing I saw was at 42nd street Times Square station. I arrived to a bunch of people clustered around talking about police and a crazy lady. Same shit different day, right? Wrong. The police arrived, and an MTA guy said that a woman pushed a man onto the tracks, assuming he was her man that'd been cheating on her. She was incorrect in her assumption and killed the wrong guy. Saw it on the news later that night, so it wasn't bullshit.   


New York really is crazy sometimes. "
So....you want to make your community better without having to actually interact with the people in said community? 
Same as blue lives matter people anywhere—they’re racist and angry about the fact that other people noticed that they’re racist. 
Construction workers and firefighters have to wear Hasidic garb too?
"I've never heard anyone refer to Amsterdam as boring... have you been there? It's no New York, but the nightlife is certainly popular.

Berlin is really at the top of my list and obviously it'd be easy for you to move there - is there a reason you're not considering it aside from it being in Germany? Again, nightlife there is hugely popular."
Bamba. It's Israeli and is slightly less addictive than heroin.
"Culturally Jewish atheist here. 

Honestly, I feel a bit sorry for any member of any extremely religious sect. I view the level of time spent purely on prayer and worship to be wasted life. But, that's not my business. I would not presume to tell you how to spend your brief time on earth. I generally keep those views to myself. But, you asked explicitly.

Regarding Hasidim in particular, I have some very strongly negative opinions about *particular practices of the religion*, such as metzitzah b'peh, harassing passers-by who do not believe in your religion and need not dress to your codes in order to walk on public streets, and holding up airline flights by refusing to sit next to women (try booking the whole row if your religion demands it, make arrangements in advance).

Note that these opinions are only about the outward behavior toward the world, not about Hasidim as human beings. They are opinions about what constitutes *reasonable behavior* for people living in the modern world. These are opinions of particular behaviors that impact the lives of those outside your insular community. Don't impose your religion on others. Don't assault people. And, even though this is wholly within your community, don't let your [mohels kill your infants](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/29/why-ultra-orthodox-jewish-babies-keep-getting-herpes.html). Infanticide is a crime. Criminally negligent homicide is a crime. Reckless endangerment is a crime. At the very least, metzitzah b'peh is reckless endangerment.

Act like mensches and I have no issues with you dressing according to 18th century standards. I don't even mind waiting until after the holidays to get my orders from B&amp;H. ;)"

Lotta conservatives up there.

Did you move to the city a few years ago? It seems like people go through a frenzy right when they move and it tapers off after 1-3 years here. 
Starbucks is the bathroom of last resort.
"Glad you had a good time. It's refreshing to see a post like this, and see people actually enjoying being in the City. It sort of reminds us that we take a lot of this for granted. "
"4) The people unfortunately. It's on us. Most New Yorkers, probably the vast majority are very clean people who would never litter. But there are always those assholes who ruin it for everybody. "
"Since you asked for the freelancer’s perspective — I’m a travel blogger and my income comes from lots of different places. I secured my own place twice, in 2015 and 2017. It was tough but I did it.

How I did it:

—Tax return is the basis for how much you earn.

—Literally every fucking document ever of me getting paid. Every bank account, every Paypal transaction. Huge folder with cheat sheets telling how much I earned in each place and making it easy for the landlords to understand where my money came from.

—When my latest place was iffy about accepting me, I sent screenshots from Mediavine (display ad network) because it showed my month by month income was more than the rent.

—One apartment asked for an extra two weeks’ security and I was happy to do that. Got it all back in the end.

—Be prepared to pay extra rent/security or use a guarantor. Or even have an email from a guarantor saying they would work with you."
"1) lighter layers. You can buy ultra thin specialty modest shirts or sleeve extensions or dickies etc

2) religious devotion 

3) mind over matter; on a 90-degree day we're ALL overheating, so a little bit more isn't really that big of a deal

4) they're used to it; same way someone from Hawaii might find 60 degrees super cold 

5) limited physical activity "

Think you're giving a little too much credit to Penn Station there. 
"Guy was begging for money on a crowded platform and threatening suicide by jumping in front of the train if nobody gave him money   
I saw someone yesterday cross from the downtown side to uptown side by hopping down and walkin across the tracks.. so when the train is delayed for hours bc of an unauthorized person on the track, well, it’s probably that fuckin guy. "

"Whether it's legal is what you're concerned about? Really?

You're planning on squirting water at already mentally unstable people who've taken a powerful deliriant. The best case scenario is getting your window smashed, other vandalism, and them turning your stoop into a bathroom as well. The worst case is getting beaten, stabbed, or shot. The odds of them just peacefully moving along from this are about zero.

Not to mention that as other posters have indicated, it is technically illegal, although I really doubt the cops would arrest you for it."
Minetta Tavern. Black label burger. 
"I was at the Union Square station (this was on Super Bowl Sunday 2018, was enroute to a friends) when a man fell in to the track (appeared to have lost balance). Someone screamed and people were yelling at him to stay flat on the track as a train was coming. I went over, got down on my knees and called him over. He only had one arm so it was a little awkward but I was able to hoist him up onto the platform. He was fine but definitely dazed. I had a crazy adrenaline rush while a few people tried to shake my hand. Luckily the train had stopped back in the tunnel so that man wouldn't have been run over anyways, but it was a crazy experience and one I never want to have to re-live. "
"“You did it! Congratulations! World's best cup of coffee! Great job, everybody! It's great to be here.” - Buddy"
"I live and own a business in Williamsburg.  My business' landlord is Hasidic.  I have generally never had an unpleasant one-on-one with any Hasidic people.  My landlord has always treated me fairly and responds to problems promptly.  We get a pretty decent amount of Hasidic patronage and they're always polite (I own a music school).  It's funny - the girls always know pop culture songs/movies/celebs etc and want to learn songs by Katy Perry or Sia or whatever.  The boys have no idea and only ever want to play Jewish music.  In our business transactions they are always ALWAYS very direct and want to quantify everything - to a person every single one of them has said to me 'how many lessons do I need to buy before I am an expert at this?' which is impossible to answer and always makes me laugh a bit.    

What makes me sad about the community is the lack of choice, especially for women.  I had a young female hasidic student who was SHREDDING on guitar.  Her mom was really proud of her but one day just casually said 'it's too bad it doesn't really matter because we live here' and gestured south of Broadway.  Broke my heart.  I've had young male students falling asleep over their instruments because before the lesson they had spent ten hours at Torah study.  No chance of university or higher education unless it's more Torah study.  

How do you expect a people to thrive and grow like that?  By leaning hard on other people.  That's the part that makes me frustrated or even angry sometimes - the fact that (and I'm open to hearing a different side on this) the community seems to take and take and take and doesn't ever give anything back to non-Hasidim.  It's not fair to anyone inside or outside, this refusal to integrate.    

My two cents."
"Join your block association, then ask them this question."

"If you're excluding all of Asia, I don't know if there's much we can recommend you. In terms of density, ""doesn't sleep""-ness, and lifestyle NYC shares a lot more in common with places like Tokyo than it does with any other North American city.

I'm from Vancouver originally - you have to define what ""nightlife"" means to you. If you're looking for high-end clubs and chic lounges, Vancouver has little of it, and what little exists won't measure up to the NYC equivalents. Nobody does finance debauchery quite like NYC and London.

If you're looking for dive bars, hipster joints, live music of other varieties, there's plenty to choose from and the scene is much richer. Vancouver's downtown is highly urban, but culturally it's more low-key. This is a feature for many residents, not a bug, but it depends on what you're looking for.

Have you considered Toronto? It's dense, highly urban, and generally has more of the chic lounge/club scene than Vancouver. It is, however, nowhere near as large as NYC (but nowhere in the US or Canada is)."
