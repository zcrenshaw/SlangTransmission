"""Resetting to defaults"" is the best way to fix something that's very fucked up. 

If only I can do that with my life… "
Who would have thought management wanting to spend more on infrastructure would be a BAD thing...
WE HAVE A UNICORN *SIRENS* WE MUST ~~KIDNAP~~ INVITE IT IN FOR STUDY
"&gt; Prof: But it wasn't coffee! Got that? IT WASN'T COFFEE! &lt;SLAM&gt;

Got it.  White Russian at 9am then.  "
This hits home on SO MANY LEVELS...
"You can, but the boot up time is \~18 years."
"I know, right?  Sigh.  It took another couple of years to convince them to wall off the server room so we could get rid of the fire sprinklers over the servers..."
"When their faces went white after telling them you reset it, I was expecting something like ""this was index-linked to all the other boards on the east coast and you've just wiped out all Broadway shows. No, of course we don't have backups!""

I've spent too much time in server rooms full of forgotten (but still very much in use) equipment. "
"So lazy guy thinks he is getting away with his laziness, but in reality, he was doing the most work?   Seems like a management win to me."
"Yo momma's a keeper.  
It took years for mine to understand the basics, at least now she gives me a call when she's suspicious about that email, or doesn't know if she should allow the execution of a program asking for consent (normally everything updates automagically without her doing anything, but every now and then there's an outlier). Sadly as she grows older she starts forgetting things she's done hundred of times already and gets irritable when I try to help her."
You're looking at it all wrong... you had an opportunity to create such an arcane contraption you'd have infinite job security. 
"&gt;  It took another couple of years to convince them to wall off the server room so we could get rid of the fire sprinklers over the servers...

I felt my butt pucker a bit as I read that. O_o"
"We had a loan officer who had the nicest laptop in her office, until a new employee was hired and was given the top of the line model that we had at the time.

She gets upset about not having the nicest laptop anymore, brings it in, and demands that we replace it. We booted it up, it's fine, and ask ""What's the problem that you're having with it?"" Well, she knows that vanity probably won't go over well, so she picks it up and slams it down on the corner of the table, shattering the screen and breaking the keyboard. Demands, ""Now get me a new one"". 

My engineer comes and gets me at that point. I look at the wreckage and explain, ""You realize that damaging company property is a termination offense, right?"" She replies that she's one of the top producers and nobody would fire her. Which is true. So I charged her, personally, for the replacement (also in the policies). Want to see a sales rep upset? Mess with their compensation...

But hey, she now had a laptop on par with the other woman in her office. So all's well, right?"
"&gt;Inside which there were new folders like ""Old Mac Desktop"", ""Old Mac Documents"", ""Old Mac Downloads""...

Sorry, but I couldn't get that song out of my head after reading this part. ""Old Mac Downloads had a farm, e-i-e-i-o."""
"&gt;ugh....why did she even hire an IT only to second-guess the IT.

Because IT is an expense and thus she's doing everything to avoid having to pay more. 

'course then its your fault when the internet is slow and the system is down."
Wow. You can set printer availability hours in the driver settings on the print server - would this not be more reliable? 
"At her level of expertise, her time won't come cheap."
"&gt;IT nods and looks at me like I'm a bit dumb

&gt;IT looked stunned.

&gt;IT laughed, sounding a little amused and slightly sheepish as 

Being on this side of it, and then on the other side of it helping people, I try to make a concerted effort NOT to be the asshole.  

I remember back when as a user of an application attached to a large database, I was trying to convince the vendor that something was wrong with their product.  You would open up the application, and it would calculate it one way, and then in the database it was something different.

This was how I discovered it.  I was pulling information from the database it's self, and it wasn't matching the application's display.

He accused me of doing things that I wasn't supposed to.

Him: ""You should NEVER connect to the database that way!  you are changing things!""

Me:  ""It says in your own white papers to connect this way""

Him: ""NEVER CONNECT THAT WAY!  You are changing things! ""

Me: ""I am not changing things.  Here, look...""

I remembered that I saw the differences between two different displays on the application it's self, but you had to dig through a thousand screens to look at them.  The response from the database was just quicker.

His tone was that I was some stupid user who had their head up their ass and wasting his time, causing my own problems.

Then I had to INSIST that he bare with me while I showed him in the application it's self.

I pull it up here- this calculation

I pull it up here - different calculation

I had to cut him off twice to listen and watch because he kept dismissing what I was doing.  

The only thing that kept him from wandering off the track was the fact I was his customer, and he HAD to listen to me for a little while did I get him through the evidence.


After I showed him what was happening his response was ""Oh.""

He put me on hold for five minutes, and then came back.

Him: ""yea,that's an established bug. We have a patch for that.""

Me:""So, I am not changing things in the database?""

Him: .......

He defacto called me a moron and no apology afterwards.  At least his tone of voice changed and stopped acting condescending to me.

Life lesson for me.  Even when I have a distinct feeling that I know what the problem is and it's the users fault, I have to make sure.  I never want to be THAT asshole.

So... what does a lowercase 5 look like?
APFS has been ... fun ... for me as well. I do hate the “what sort of backups do(n’t) you have?” conversation. Feels bad man. 
"Apparently not. And I'm pretty sure the ""INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS"" he was referring to were just him."
I’m going to go out on a limb and say it’s all just sitting in his trash folder. Just...take it out....
"There's been a few other moments I wanted to post about my mum, but I thought this one was really above and beyond anything I ever anticipated.

A few weeks ago, a colleague of hers came to visit while I was home. While her colleague is over, she mentions to mum that she doesn't like her messages all being aggregated into fb messenger.

Mum proceeds to reset the messaging app defaults and disassociate messenger from sending/receiving texts.

It was beautiful to watch."
"It's not ""Casual Friday"" without a few casualties, after all."
"It’s not even computer ignorance, it’s being unable to follow basic instructions and lying when confronted about it. "
It's written in subscript
"So these ""industry professionals"" didn't do the number one rule of tech when it goes wrong, i.e. turn it off and on again?"
Figured it might be a power issue. Possibly the psu I'm thinking. Or a short on the motherboard..?
"I'm used to faces going blank followed by looks of uneasiness about letting me continue to fiddle with settings.

I went to a private highschool of ~350 total students that had a sound system built into the building with a conduit running the the back of the room that you could plug in a nice audio console to control everything with. I volunteered to help and was given some basic tutorials from people that knew fuckall about audio. 

I was given suspicious looks from all the faculty if I was ever spending time after school working solo on it to learn as much as I could. There was some strange crackling and popping sounds that they weren't able to fix for years. After a month or two of fiddling and calling local audio places, I discovered that whoever trained me on plugging this in had been causing extreme damage to the 40 pin conduit hose that connects to the wall. They said it should *always* be plugged very carefully, ensuring the pins matched up nicely before screwing it in. NOT by jamming the bottom down, and wriggling it back and forth and then screwing it in. (Who would have guessed that?)

After I told the principle and theatre department head what the issue was and the steps I took to fix it, they informed the rest of the school faculty that I was the only student to have access to the console. 

I spent all 4 years learning the ins and outs of that system and instructing as many people as I could on the proper use and setup of it all. I graduated 5 years ago, I wonder how things are going now..."
dear heavens....
Not if that hard drive won't spin up anymore...
"You can't do this! It had to be relevant somehow... like that single PC was holding the prescription records of 100,000,000 customers, or something. Chekhov's gun and such."
"That is one of the weird things about computers.  The newest people and the ones who abuse them the most seem to get the newest models sooner.  The people who treat them carefully so they last years end up keeping them for years and having the oldest models.

On the other hand, who cares if you've got machine with 5% faster than the average.  Not even noticeable."
Sounds like the kind of person that expects color printers to magically add color to a monochrome document.
"There's a guy who worked with us briefly that nobody remembers his name, he's just ""Sleepy Guy"". I'll give you three guesses why he didn't work out."
"For the next 4 sleepless nights, Professor Dingleberry was kept up by waking nightmares of The precise moment when his lukewarm cup of Sanka and heavy cream tipped onto his gateway. Some say he's never been the same since..."
ugh. that sounds painful. I spend my days explaining the difference between voicemail and answering machines. This reminds me of that.
It's kind of disturbing how many people don't understand the most basic things about computers when they're so heavily integrated into our lives now.
"At least op had that option. The city I live in, in the fire code, commercial properties have to have sprinklers in every room. Even server rooms. "
"I need religion to be morally stable.  Without it, I'm a murderous heathen who will decimate this office population.

DENIED !"
"This is a case of paying for the brand. Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM. Even though it is often overpriced, occasionally underpowered, and *always* overcomplicated... someone at IBM will know how to fix the problem.

Of course, for the equivalent generic Linux server, you could just Google the problem."

Username checks out. 
"Being in support for many years, and always being the curious type for even more years, I never understood the hostility toward fresh hands on an old problem. If it could make things worse, or there is volatile data, sure - but if there is nothing to lose, what are you pissed at???"
"Rule #1: never use supplied equipment when the rent for it costs $10 or less a month. Buy your own gear. It's paid for itself in less than a year or two usually.

Rule #2: you are always wrong. The best way to be ""right"" is to make yourself visible and noticed everyday. You may not always be at your desk, but you should always be ""doing something"" like crawling in ceiling tiles ""for scheduled maintenance."" You don't need to get dirty doing this. ""Man, I didn't realize keeping the network going was that labor intensive."" ""Cupcake, it's a battle every day keeping Facebook available for you."""
"And most printers nowadays have auto-on and off timers too. 
Total power-off, or not accepting jobs only."
"If only. As messy as he is at organizing his files, he always immediately empties the trash."
"your company need to do a couple of things.  
1. Standardise on a set of printers(Small A4/Letter possibly B/W, small MFP, Large MFP, is my suggestion) and only have one brand/model in each set. This cuts down on toner stock.   
2. Get a Print management system such as PaperCut, and use it to find out which printers aren't being used.   
3. Go full on with swipe-card readers on the printers, and set up pooled queues in Papercut.    
Then, a user sends it to a common queue, then walks over to the nearest printer, swipes his card and gets his printout there. If that printer isn't working, he can just go somewhere else to swipe and print.   
and you can set the server to auto-delete still-queued documents after a day or two, and seriously save on dead trees.   
Also, printers are the domain of IT, don't let users set up or order new ones. Never."
