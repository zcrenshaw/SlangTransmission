You don't want to know.
"Who the hell is getting food on the subway?  What, would we grade how clean the platform is?

... Oh, you mean the sandwich chain."

Peter Pan's in Greenpoint is my favorite!
"I mean except pay scales, the 40 hour work week, paid time off and the entire concept of workers rights, safe working conditions and child labor laws."
"Manhattan is built on a series of old rivers and streams, so there is a huge amount of water just naturally present under the bedrock and within the bedrock. 

MTA pump rooms draw 13 million gallons of water a day. Some of it is bound to leak out. "
"Nice try, Time Out Magazine"
"You're in Bronx, Manhattan, or Staten Island? Contact the Science, Industry and Business Library. They are on 34th and Madison, but you can schedule a meeting with a business librarian: business@nypl.org


Queens and Brooklyn also have small business resource centers. I don't know the contact information.


You can also sign up for three (# might have changed) consultations with the SCORE office to get guidance from their mentors.  
They have an office in lower Manhattan and also do consultations at libraries. 


Local law students can also help you start an LLC or similar for no/low cost. I have a few friends that worked with Brooklyn Law, but others offer similar. Look for the law school closest to your place of business. 


Also look into business schools (Columbia, Fordam, Baruch, etc) they have business students who can help and can use your start up as a school project and give you some ideas. NYU, SIBL, and have business plan competitions which are also good for reaching experts. Even if you don't win, you will learn a lot.

 
NYC also has a small business support center that might have some resources for you. "
The point of tipping means you want them to deliver it to your doormat.

Never been, but its right next to my work and have alway been curious.

7th ave and 36th Street"
You're one of the best regards though.
Pay two months of rent in advance. I'm having so much fun.
Take him for a walk over the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. Both have fantastic skyline views. 
"Doughnut Plant for cake donuts.

Dough for yeast donuts.

"Totally concoct stories of their life, and when it turns out they actually do get off at the stop I smile and think I was right about everything. 

Mr. Great clothes bad shoes, the stop past Wall street, because the shoes weren't right for him to make the cut actually on Wall street. 

Lady with stroller: whatever the stop before my stop is because I don't want to deal with it. 

Mr Showtime one of the 42nd street stops I hope he's going to Broadway but hes not this is his Broadway show. 

Mariachi guys: the next stop, please be the next stop and please stay at the restaurants. 

Lady asleep on the train: last stop, definitely the last stop and she was supposed to get off at Grand Central to connect Metro North to Darien.

Guy typing on phone (me rt now) he's writing a post on reddit about judging people on the subway while the lady over my shoulder reads what I'm writing and pretends not to be. I feel you breathing on my arm lady, gross. "
"Rudy’s in Hell’s Kitchen, cheap beer and free hot dogs. 

Mirrors on Grand in Clinton Hill, nice bartenders, cheap, amazing pizza across the street. "
"LOL - I thought you meant people who live in shantytowns in abandoned tunnels.

What you're looking for is a dermatologist. I don't know if you'll find anyone to do it for free - do you have insurance?"
"I was on the uptown 2/3.  At 96th street the conductor said: White people get off here.

(And then they pretty much all did to transfer to the 1 uptown.)"
"The Heidelberg, idk how authentic it is but there’s always mad germans there."
"The subway uses the 3rd rail for electricity, so if your car jiggles off of it for a moment, the lights go off. It used to happen all the time and now it's pretty rare"
"Your broker is an asshole.  You're not renting the apartment from him, you're renting it from your landlord.  Contact the landlord, who I assume is the person you'd renew your lease with."
"The new policy is only two months old, so you're likely reading posts from before the change.

I would also discourage you from doing the Empire State Building; the Top of the Rock has the better view, largely since it includes the Empire State Building. If you want to do two observation decks, consider One World Trade Center."
Bra technical designer - I make bras fit.
"I do sometimes. You can even play that game to try to get a seat. ""Oh he/she looks like they'll get off at the next stop. I'll stand in front of them."""
"Also don't be afraid to ask folks for directions. We've all got a resting bitch face on, but most of us are more than willing to help."
"Donut Pub for standard, traditional donuts. "
I’ve had sex in front of the window in a high rise apt. I totally didn’t care if someone peeped a look. Hope they enjoyed it.
hilarious. Did you inform him that you had scheduled a cleaning of the apartment while you were still in possession of the apartment? I would itemize the stuff that's missing and inform him that you would be billing him for the remainder of the items he took from you that were not returned. 
Nah man you did the right thing. A broken door is infinitely better than forever sleep. 
"I'd take the cheaper one. I think it's a little more nuanced than just ""is it better being close to work or close to social life"" in most cases, especially as rent costs/apartment amenities are a big factor. Usually it's cheaper to be further from work and people have to weigh the commute vs. savings, and often people work in Midtown/Fidi which aren't quite as residential and so the feeling of being ""surrounded"" by work would be more prevalent. 

If it's *cheaper* to be in walking distance to work, when your work is actually in a residential neighborhood, and you'd get a W/D in-unit? This feels like a no-brainer to me. You'll still be really close to Kips Bay social life if that's where you like to go out. I think it's less likely that you'll feel stuck in a routine of going to work/home and more like you're saving a ton of time, can have lunch at home if you want, and can quickly get ready to go meet your friends once you're done with work. 

If your social life were much further away and your work was in a more sterile neighborhood I think my answer might be different.

"Here's the great thing about the grid system: the numbers tell you which direction you're going.

*In Manhattan*, as street numbers go up, you're going north or ""Uptown."" As street numbers go down, you're going south or ""Downtown."" 42nd St is thus north or uptown from 34th St \(in other words, look for the Uptown track\).

\(To help you navigate even further: as *avenue* numbers go up, you're going west, so 5th Avenue is west of 1st Avenue.\)

\(This does not apply exactly the same to the outer boroughs.\)"
"In the neighborhoods I am familiar with (Wash. Heights, Inwood) it is standard for the delivery person to come to the apartment door. This is generally the norm for delivery people as sometimes they serve elder residents who would not be expected to walk down.

I also have evidence that this can vary from building to building, in places that have door/desk staff. Residents should consult the building policy on this (ask doorman/deskman).

The general rule that I know of is that coming to the apartment door is accepted, coming down to the building door is considered a convenience for the delivery person."
"I really liked Padmapper--I feel like 80% of all apartment hunting sites don't show proximity to a subway, and relationship to a decent subway stop is the most important thing for me. "
The subway by me has a grade. Subways hang so much crap on the windows you probably just miss it.
"The Back Room is pretty nice, and is in the same underground space as an actual speakeasy from the 1920s.  It’s not as fancy as the other, better-known speakeasies, but it’s also less crowded.  Plus they lean into the theme by serving cocktails in coffee cups and beer bottles in paper bags."
yup. ever since moving here I just love doing stuff alone with a oil pen. you can smoke ANYWHERE no one knows and u just can have an anxiety attack in peace 
"If we didn't live here, we'd be complaining about wherever we do live."
"It could have gone either way.

FDNYs hand was forced,  had they left and a person in distress was missed all the internet keyboard warriors would be out in force. 



Stop by with a six pack or a bottle to apologise.  It's nice to know your neighbors. 

Glad they are ok. "
"A train. Nearly every white person still on the train gets off at 59th before you go up to 125 haha, it’s kind of insane actually."
"I always liked that Dunkin Donuts commercial where someone has a box of donuts, the lights go out briefly, and then all the passengers have powdered sugar around their mouths"
I’m a high school art teacher! More like a mom/therapist to 219 kids though 
Union protest. Really annoyed with all the people annoyed by it.
While you’re visiting the WTC you should walk a few blocks down to the skyscraper museum in battery park city. Apparently it’s pretty kid friendly

You must have amazing calves
"Probably a lot. Bad battery alarm sounds are usually different from actual fire alarm sounds. If I couldn't smell anything and the stairwell alarm wasn't also going off, I'd have called the super first. "
"I went to Columbia for both undergrad and grad so I spent significant portion of my life there. So whenever I'm on the 1 uptown I try to predict who is going to get off at 116th and Broadway.  It's so crazy because when I was a college student I thought I looked and acted like an adult but now that I'm in my 40s college students seem almost like children.  I also look for the stressed out, haggard slightly older people who are wearing worn, old clothes and look like they haven't slept in days... The PhD students haha."
"you shouldn't be talking to a broker, they help you find the apartment, then the relationship is over"
"Lucky dog

Nice backyard, and dogs"
Residual fluids from all the workers who died building the subway system
"Look at the signs: ""Uptown and the bronx"" is the one you are looking for. ""Downtown and Brooklyn"" is the wrong direction. "
Everybody shower together to save water.
"i know people in glen rock, ridgewood, and fair lawn NJ that live in great neighborhoods and are walking distance to their train station. i grew up on LI and can’t think of many stations a reasonable train distance from the city that have great neighborhoods immediately surrounding them where you could walk to the train. maybe massapequa park, rockville centre. i HATED driving to the train when i lived on LI so i get where you’re coming from. i dread the day when we go back to the suburbs and i need to buy a car. 

if that area in jersey is of interest i know a woman who started a consulting group that helps people from the city find the best north jersey/bergen county neighborhood for them based on budget, preferences, etc. PM me if you’d like that info. "
