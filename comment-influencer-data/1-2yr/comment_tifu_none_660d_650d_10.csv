"If you cared that little about them, there's 0 chance you would still have them now even if you did take the paper. There's a million stories just like yours for that same reason.

Even if you did hold onto them, would you not have sold them when they were at $100? $1000? Point is there's almost no chance that story ended with you casing out at $160k, don't beat yourself up over it too much.

I nearly bought some when they were sitting at £90 but decided against it because ""how much higher can they really go?""."

I'm just glad that you're not cutting anymore
You had a lap full of pants and you couldn't see the solution to your predicament? 
why didnt you just go do it in the bathroom if you were already running the shower?
"I had a stroke last Friday at 23. Age is irrelevant guys, if you’re having symptoms: GET CHECKED!"
I like to lay down while I beat off... No good reason really.
Totally not your fault your supervisor should have told you about the alarm and when to use it. But we don’t live in a perfect society and usually the weakest person gets the blame 
"""How the fuck does he know im jacking off?!?"" I think.

Why is there a dedicated SWAT button? You work at a bank or other high security institution?
"AND WHAT CAN I DO IF I DON'T LIVE (or ever lived) IN USA? seriously, I want to help. If we allow this to happen, we are next"
That's a good reason.
No locked doors is a really silly rule if you have young adults in the house. Asking for trouble really.
Yikes!! Glad you are doing better (finally). Congrats on the engagement too!

"DON'T PANIC! 

1) see if you can take the course online for credit that will count for Oxford and your uni.

2) See if you can take the course in person at a different uni nearby for credit at Oxford and your uni

3) See if you can take the course online or in person at your uni or nearby during the summer session before you start at Oxford. This would obviously suck possibly having to commute and change your summer plans , but it's better than losing your Oxford spot.

4) See if your uni offers a self directed study course that could meet the requirements.

5) See if you can self study using online resources and take a CLEP course exam to show proficiency and get credit.

It's a sucky position to be in for sure, but you might not be truely as fucked as it seems now.

All cartoons during my childhood showed that castor oil was something disgusting. 
"That's what I said too and he just responded with ""well maybe you shouldn't go around pressing random buttons."" Honestly it's totally fine now, it's pretty much a meme at my work. He wasn't mad about it at all everyone just found it really funny that I got the SWAT team called on accident. But it does suck that the weakest person does get all the blame in today's society, but that's just life. "

"Can you imagine the argument that would would ensue if she couldn't find it, and you're still refusing to give it to her days later haha. "
I'm glad you're seemingly ok! Keep the faith and stay positive!
"Strokes in younger people are more common than before.  I had mine when I was 30.  It sucks, but trying to stay positive is the best you can do.  Nothing good comes from negativity.  

If it's any consolation, when I had mine, I argued with my sister for about an hour.  I, too, did not display the  classic symptom of slurred speech and I was still drinking my Sprite the entire time.  

I'm not sure why I was so vehement, but I refused to let her call 911.  I am not typically a tough guy, but unfortunately, I don't remember that time well.

That said, I agree with OP.  If you feel anything wrong, with your head particularly, go to the ER or at least the doc-n-a-box.  If you're wrong, you're embarrassed. If you're right, you'll save yourself.

"Not at first. For a while they thought I flooded the bathroom on purpose or something. For a long time I told them I fell asleep while waiting for the shower to warm up, they could tell I was lying; but didnt know what about.

Then finally a few years later my dad said something about it at dinner. I was more confident by then and just told the family what really happened."
It sounds like he was looking for a reason.

You would have sold those bitcoin at $100 and been happy with the $2000. Don’t think for one second you would have had the genius to hold it to $8000. Don’t worry about it and move on. I bought apple stock at $97 pre-split ($14 current price). I sold it at $120 and was pretty happy. I don’t kick myself because who would have thought it would go to $170

"This is 99% sure not tetanus!

Not to be that guy that is anti-fun at parties, but I believe that something else was going on here. (Unless the doctors told you the diagnosis was tetanus and you are the outlier of medicine and I should shut up). Anyway in general this will all be still true:

Tetanus is a bacteria that in victims is contracted normally via wounds caused by bites (both human and animal) or wounds that have been in contact with soil/dirt, mainly if that wound still hasn't been cleaned/covered +6 hours after the incident. A knife cut is really unlikely to give tetanus.

Also, tetanus does not cause the weird, non healing, red or black, puss excreting, painful wounds that stay open. Again, in most case. Most other bacteria do this though, and can of course also cause pretty bad disease.

And lastly, after the incubation time (7-10 days) the first symptoms will be, lock-jaw, paralysis and heart rhythm problems that can be fatal (you basically stop breathing). An actual tetanus infection is INCURABLE. you can give booster shots up to a few day after you got the wound. One booster shot lasts for 10 years or more!

What I think is that you got infected by Staph A. 
A bacteria that lives on the skin normally and does not cause any harm, but can cause great problems in a deeper wound. Staph A. would explain your finger looking weird. The bacteria could in theory spread to the heart and cause serious heart disease. Luckily, anti biotics via injection can easily prevent this, also fitting your hospital story.

On an end note: children play in the dirt, they fall, they cut themselves rolling in places wild animals do whatever. They get bitten and clawed by animals more often than anyone, meaning they are at risk for a disease that has no option but to prevent via vaccination and immune booster shots.

"So your “friend” who couldn’t be bothered to find a sitter for his kid drags the kid to a party in the woods where people are drinking and fucking, pawns him off on a drunken you (not your fault, just pointing out that it’s irresponsible to give your kid to a drunk person in case, you know, *exactly this happens*), you get extra fucked over by having to sleep outside, and you feel like you fucked up? You’re a damned saint in this story, son. Tell your friend to grow the fuck up and be responsible for his kid because you won’t do it anymore. Piece of shit pisses me off - how the fuck does someone even *do* that, it’s not just “ooh irresponsible” it’s fucking *dangerous* for the kid if the kid gets lost, it’s way too easy for kid to get exposed to something he shouldn’t, and all of it could have been avoided if he’d just gotten a real sitter or manned up and stayed home even if it meant he didn’t get his nut off. 

You’re a good dude. I’m sorry that doing the right thing put you in a shitty, dangerous situation and that your friends all have their heads up their asses."

"I was told about the silent alarm at the pizza place I worked at, which was good because it was part of the alarm system for the whole restaurant. Basically, we would have to hit the middle row of numbers in a 10 key type set-up in full view of anyone in the front of the restaurant. I'm lucky that our manual basically said, ""If we're robbed, don't be a hero. Just do what they say because this is a pizza place.""

Oh, and my boyfriend worked there after I quit. They didn't tell him about the alarm."

"Worked at a movie theater that had two on either side of the box office room. 

One day when I was working as a manager I picked up the phone in the back room. 

""Thank you for calling, how can I help you today?""

""This is Officer SoAndSo from the HPD, how are you doing today.""

""Great, what can I do for you?""

""Well, I've got about 20 officers that need to know what's going on there today.""

""..."", In dumbfounded silence

""Someone has pressed the silent alarm and has been repeatedly been pressing it for the last 15 min. It is policy to make a call to check and see and get an employee to come outside and verify an 'all clear' ""

""Uhh, I will be right out sir, sorry to bother you guys"" 

""It's alright, it happens, but we are still ganna need someone outside pretty quick""

As I am freaking out of trying to remember where the buttons where I look in the box office to see one of the employees leaning sitting back with his foot tapping the underside of the counter. 

""HEY, F-ING STOP HITTING THE F-ING COUNTER, YOU CALLED THE COPS WITH THE SILENT ALARM""

I've never seen a fairly large guy turn totally pale, but he sure as hell lost all color in his face. I went out and explained everything to the officers in the giant seat van that it was a bored employee not an armed movie goer angry about concession prices that had brought them there. They reassured me that it happens and just be sure to tell people where they're located

I would go on to add to the wallet occasionally when I remembered because the mining app I had was a command line based one. Anyways, at the same time I was playing this online game called Aion and had some issues so I had to reformat my computer. Bitcoin was nothing important to me so I never jotted down my wallet code, nor anything really, and just reformatted.

Your stroke shouldn't take away your ability to do physical jobs.  Doctors don't really know how to deal with strokes in young people.  It's relatively new.  Also, after Christopher Reeves spinal cord energy, medicines understanding of nerve damage recovery has changed.

Listen to uour docs of course.  Mine saved my life, but take their limitations with a grain of salt.

Best of luck to you.   "
Oof
Wow I have never come across balls of that size. 
"Some doctors truly are dismissive of women, it is a huge problem. I recently had Guillain Barre Syndrome and was REPEATEDLY dismissed as having anxiety. I even saw the discharge notes attributing my elevated heartrate to  anxiety. I mean I WAS anxious, probably because I was becoming slowly paralyzed in all 4 limbs and I couldn’t control my left eye. But sending me home with a misdiagnosis could have been deadly. Thank goodness I finally found a doctor who took me seriously. "
I want to know how he frames that in someone else's house.
Woof. The real TIFU is in the comments

I can assure you that paying for a better internet access will cost you less.
Urine a bit of trouble. 
"Can confirm. My parents used to give me castor oil (for constipation, not punishment) and it was the worst fucking taste in the world. Literally gag inducing. Kinda like a cross between spoiled meat and raw canola oil"
Thanks for the number to text! I tried but right now it's busy (which is good!) So I'll try later
"Mom, Dad. I'm coming out...............about what happened the night I flooded the house. "
how the fuck do you have enough extra space to lose 3 paintings. 
"It's not a SWAT button, and I'm pretty sure OP doesn't know the difference between over funded cops and a SWAT team.

He most likely just pressed the silent alarm and the cops came and took precautionary measures in case there's an ongoing robbery inside the building.

"
"How could you not? Once upon a time I worked at Petsmart. Down this short hallway that takes you to the sickrooms/laundry, there's this random red button set in a shiny metal plate and no label, all by itself in the middle of the wall.

I made it a month before I pressed it.

One night after a new hire asked me what it did, we went and asked the closing manager, because as it hadn't set of a blaring alarm, I still didn't know. Two more coworkers went with, since they didn't know either. She smiled, and asked if we'd pressed it. *Everyone* admitted to having pressed it out of curiosity.

That stupid button resets the floodlights in case of a power outage. Afterwards I pressed that sucker all the time, pretending that it turned off the lasers that protected the sickrooms."
"Look from the positive side. If it wasn't for you, how much longer would that unhealthy relationship go on."
"Insurance covers losses due to robbery, generally. Doesn't cover bringing your dead ""heroic"" staff back to life."
"Shit, I didn't even think of that either. Props for your life skills."
"Dad's a fucking legend for being so chill too. My insides cringed thinking about my parents asking if I ""finished"" lmao."
Would have been cheaper to change his name legally before the trip then change it back after...fyi
