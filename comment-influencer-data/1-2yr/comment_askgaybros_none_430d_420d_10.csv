Lol that's the kind of spontaneous romance and fun I crave.
*turns around to see who they're talking about*
"Tell your parents you saw your brother kissing a guy, then when he says it wasn't him, it was you, it will look like he's just desperately trying to cover it up. And when you get the chance kick him in the balls. From me. "
"Of course it is, thanks western religion."
"&gt; **Do your parents know you’re gay?**

&gt; *They do. They just don’t know I’m a whore.*"
This would make me cum immediately. I’m a perv for some good old fashioned domestic bliss
"Switch to using tinder

Grindr= Lets fuck! my place or yours? 

Tinder=Lets grab a beer or coffee, get to know each other a little better before we take things to the bedroom.

Also, why are you telling these guys on Grindr your a virgin off the bat anyway? Save that conversation till you are actually in the bedroom or close to taking it there. "
"I'm so proud of you!

Punch that fucker! People who can't respect boundaries deserve every bit of the consequences"
"Yup, especially these days. Don't start school back up until the last week of August, so I've been doing fuck all this summer. Mainly jerking off and running errands for my parents. "
I dont think age is the problem but there is a power balance issue. He is an intern and if you try to have sex with him he’ll think It will benefit his career and be pressured into it. Could also raise HR issues if you have sex with him and it doesn’t benefit his career path 
"If you want to salvage this friendship or keep the drama down, I would hold off on coming out for at least a little bit. Kind of like when you make any big decision, get your affairs in order. By this I mean: next time he wants to jerk off to porn, tell him you don’t want to. Give him the opportunity in the future to see that you aren’t some guy trying to deceptively check out his cock. If he gets weird about you saying no, then that’s his deal. Then, maybe when you do come out, there’s a leverage point in any kind of discussion. You can say something like: yeah once I figured this out about myself, I thought I shouldn’t do that anymore because if the tables were turned, I don’t think I would like it anymore. This way, it shows that you value honesty and trust, and that you are capable of empathy. At that point, you would have done as much as you could and if the chips don’t fall how you like, you will have to cut your losses and put up with it. Unfortunately, one of the things about being gay in much of contemporary, western society is learning to healthily process rejection and the disappointment of bigotry. Fortunately, like it’s been said many times, you end up getting better, but which I mean, you end end up getting better with realizing what these kinds of things mean for yourself. You’ll likely find as you come out and live openly that interestingly enough, sometimes a declaration of your sexuality can bring out some truths in other people, even though your sexuality may have nothing to do with them."
"I feel ya bro. Seeing those beautiful men makes me both horny and so sad. It makes me mad how some dudes are just so naturally handsome, they could wear a plastic bag on their head and still be so hot. And then there's me trying my best not to look like a drug addict or a walking halloween costume."
"You know, usually things like these are stupid and don't work, but I think this really would actually."
"You don’t need a label for your sexuality. Follow your instinct and your heart. Next time you’re with this guy, if it feels right to kiss him, hug him or tell him your feelings, DO IT. "
As an intactivst I would say yes you are having your genitals phisically chopped apart at a stage when you phisically cannot consent parents that do this genuinely make me sick and I hope I live to see the day this practice is criminalised for anyone under age of consent
that’s kinda how i found out i was gay lol
Someone should write a short story that personifies Grindr as a self-sabotaging gay man struggling to find love.
"The fact that you're here and not talking to a priest or some shit is the best thing honestly, just let it be. He'll tell you when he's ready and don't worry about him being sexually active i mean I'm pretty sure most people lost their virginity at 18 afterall and in the mean time ask your friend if he's still looking at gay porn. Literally any chance you get."
your brother is a manipulative cunt
Assume it wasn't directed towards me and keep walking.
"We had spent the night at this small gathering of friends and alex had been looking at this friend of ours for a long time, and he kept telling me how hot she was and what he would give to fuck her and stuff, he was drinking so i took him home and we played some video games and after a while he put on some porn and told me he was super horny and asked we whether i minded if he jacked off and then said it was cool if i joined...

now that i read this it sounds like /r/thathappened but it did lol"
Dear diary
"Did this with my bf wo was  9"" when I was 16, I had a bit of a sore throat but still went for it and my throat closed up and I couldn't breath. I remember falling to the floor in his bedroom and thinking my family would find out my closeted ass literally choked to death on a dick. 

But, Live by the dick, die by the dick. 
Not a bad way to go IMO"
"Yes, in a breathy voice.

"
"It's me, LaGanja."
I think it depends on the person and the piercing. Some people look good with them. Ear piercings are fine. Dick piercings scare me. 
"Damn you got raped. I mean it’s good that you’re taking it in stride but man, that was awful to read. "
"A relationship is only worth the amount of work a person is willing to put into it. If that person happens to be on Reddit complaining about his BF gaining 20lbs and contemplating dumping him...what's the point of trying to convince him otherwise?

In all honesty, most people here asking for advice have already made up their minds what they're going to do. They just come here to find people to agree with them to help clear their conscience."
"The advice I'd give someone in a new relationship (&lt;1-2 years) is quite different than the advice I'd give someone in a long-term relationship.

If you've been dating a guy for 4 months and the sex sucks and you haven't been able to improve it, move on. 

If you've been married for 10 years and your sex life has dwindled over time, my advice is going to be a bit more nuanced.

If you've been dating for a month and your guy's not out of the closet, give it more time. If you've been dating for 5 years in secret and he keeps promising that he's going to come out but hasn't made good on it, I might tell you differently. "
"""You're gay!""
""And you're adopted."""
I wake up.
"The lack of self-care is one thing. Being sad/depressed is exhausting and everything seems pointless, so I get it.

My only rule: you only get to complain if you tried and failed. If you did not try, **do not complain to me**. It doesn't help either of us and it's not fun to listen to. "
"I'm sorry that happened. ""Masc Total Tops"" who don't give head are immediately discarded in my book. Rampant internalized homophobia much?"
Gurl that bussy is haunted! U need a sexorcism. 
[deleted]
I kinda agree that's crossing the line of what's respectful and acceptable. Our bars are not sideshows for straight people to gawp at us or mock us. But I don't have a problem with them being there if they're respectful. 
"Everyone telling you to bang him have never worked a corporate job, ignore them all.

I would just remain friendly when he approaches you, but never go out of your way to say hi or interact with him. Always stay professional and keep composure no matter what, and keep the amount of social time limited and with groups."
"I think you've dodged a bullet. If he broke up with you over **that**, the relationship wouldn't have lasted anyway."
"That’s love, right there. "
I'm out now but my Mother once asked me what 'Grindr' was when she seen the icon on my phone. I told her it was a skateboarding game. Best quickfire lie I've ever told
"Tell him “yup.” If his parents get upset, you could point out to him that they should teach him not to constantly throw out such accusations without getting a confirmation. In other words, act like parents."
It was rape the moment OP said stop and the guy grabbed his neck and tried to continue. 
"&gt; **You said you finished him off even after you knew something had happened. Is that true?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes. I wasn’t gonna stop. In the heat of the moment my will power willed me to continue. Stamina.

Yes, we have a winner"
"It's common especially on people who aren't white, but white people have it too. The skin around the anus and penis are generally darker. Whoever said it was disgusting is a retard and probably has little experience with other men."
Fuck yeah! Cream my caramels 
"""Being gay is bad for gay people, because gays can't have kids so there will be no more gays one day.""

For real."
"If your doing fine have a place to live, I wouldn’t bother with someone who would willingly make me homeless. "
So nice to encounter a feel good story on here. This made me smile =) 
"Yeah, maybe you should bring this up, but make sure to not be any near judgemental. I think the most important thing to talk about is if he’s doing it because he enjoys it or because he have no other option. You should be prepared for both answers. If it is the former, you should try to understand that he’s doing something he likes. If it’s the latter, you two could work some alternative together. But again, the most important part is to talk about it without judgement, as natural as this talk could be."
"that means your approach was wrong in the first place ... i only starve all day when i have fasting labs in the morning. 
"
"I was watching porn with the volume off in my phone, exactly in the scene in which both guys are screaming of pleasure. My mom called and I answered, thinking that just like in youtube, the video would pause while I answer the call. It didn't. Not only that, it began to sound and very loud. I began screaming and saying things like ""AHHH! HELP!"" and hung the phone. When we saw each other again, she asked what happened and I just said ""nothing"". "
But it's mushy and has a weird texture like banana paste
"He's not your brother anymore. Blood doesn't make a family. Love does. It's clear he doesn't share it, even tho you might. 

Edit: Corrctions"
"""You're gay""

""Yup, what's wrong with that?"" &lt;insert educational moment with an open-minded child who is either salvageable or not&gt;"
Let them know my optometrist has a friends and family discount 
'HAHA WELL MOTHER I CERTAINLY WASN'T WATCHING HARDCORE HOMOSEXUAL PORNOGRAPHY ON THIS HERE COMPUTER THAT'S FOR SURE'
"10 years in the military and 5 in law enforcement. can confirm this will work also. It doesn't matter what the truth is, whoever lats blame first is given 90% belief that they are telling the truth "
Was he gay? 
Yes?
I could spend days alone with minimal human contact. All i need is a wifi connection and ingredients to cook.
"No clue, he was very open minded as we tackled some topics related to sexuality but I didnt ask him."
Is it too late to nominate people for this year’s Nobel prizes?
"How does this situation even play out?

Like were you and your friend just chilling around the one day and he decided to whip out his dick and just start jerking it right in front of you without even saying anything?"
"Not even finding hookups but just even gays to hang out with.

Like sorry I’m not pretty enough to have brunch friends 🤷‍♂️"
Congrats on the punch. That was horrible and I hope the guy thinks twice next time. Actualy I hope he doesn't get the next time. And I totally get you on that dom top stuff. Those are the worst.
Why are gay men always the best at making me laugh at their analogies lmfao. 
"""STOP IT MOM"""
"Not OP but I find that if I have a full stomach when I bottom, often there will be an uncomfortable feeling of 'pressure' when I'm getting fucked. Much prefer to bottom on an empty stomach."
I need post work sex everyday then
"Well, then I guess that this means that you are a ""Side"": a guy who doesn't like anal sex.

You're not the only one. :)"
"I don't know why you need to place both of your sexuality in such a box.

yes he's a power bottom, but he can be a great top too now.

What you do with that is completely up to you.

Are you still attracted to him? That's the only real question.

I'm a huge bottom slut with my boyfriend but I can fuck him from time to time and we have a great time too. He's still more ""dominant"" but I like to bend the rules"
"Don't ask us, ask him!

Ask him to explain.  Tell him how you feel. Converse, don't guess. 

BUT, *don't* go makin mountains out of mole hills."
"Only when it is DONE TO the *boy*, instead of ASKED BY the *man*."
"Basically the ""no one wants to have sex with me"" excuse is BS, even if you're a 5/10, a 3/10 would accept, the real statement would be ""no one i want to have sex with wants to have sex with me"" which clearly highlights the issue, but then it means you're playing an active role in the issue you're complaining about, and that makes a lot of people uncomfortable."
"This describes me perfectly. The whore thing is what would really bother my parents. They get the whole gay thing, but they totally don't understand how casual sex is for many people these days."
"Fun fact, the cereal industry came about because circumcision wasn't enough to curb the sexual appetites of people. And the Mormons were the ones who pioneered circumcision in the US. John Kellogg to be specific. "
Casper is confirmed a top
"Just do it.  Pretend that it's not awkward.  Pretend that they, or you, are wearing speedos.   Don't play shy, or proud, or anything.  Just ignore the fact that you're naked and otherwise behave normally."
Just read any average AGB post
"I was just about to go down on my buddies hard on, we were naked and I heard a thump from the window. It was my dad's ladder. We scrambled for our clothes before he mounted it and drew even with the second story window where we had just been having sex. "
Today the girls in the werkroom were mean so I sat under a table 
"“Yes, I am! Do you know what that means?”"
"When they look into my eyes for a little too long. 

But really, appearance isn't very reliable. Pay attention to the speech and mannerism. "
"A lot of guys want a partner/bf who is better looking than them. It’s a status thing. It’s a pretty terrible cycle and everyone starts treating each other poorly, because there will always be another good looking guy out there to swipe right on. 

Personally, I go for average looking guys because they treat me better. And they actually enjoy when I do nice things for them, whereas, other above average guys expect me to give them the world and all of my attention 24/7, and I’d have to. Otherwise I’d lose them. 

So... there is someone for everyone. Just work on the stuff you can. "
"Him: ""I can't believe this""

Me: ""Stop freaking out""

Him: ""I don't even know who you are anymore""

Me: You idiot I've always been gay and I've never changed. I'm still the same person I was 5 minutes ago"""
"Yep, this is specifically one big thing that sucks about ~~shitney~~ Sydney’s hookup scene.

 NO ONE, no matter how old they are can host because the housing market is so bloody expensive, so almost everyone still lives with their parents or a bunch of house mates."
"First off: THANK YOU for that first part. I will definitely make that switch, Tinder sounds like it is more my cup of tea.  
  
I can only speak for myself: I let guys know because I was looking for someone who thinks that at least a *mild* deal, like they're lucky, or at least have some appreciation of the situation. Also to be sure they're aware that I have literally no experience with guys, so they aren't expecting anything.  
  
Again, thank you a lot for the Tinder recommendation. I've been having a hard time finding the right person."
"Um yeah. 
Everyone that ever GLANCED at a TV screen remembers that show. 
It's TeenTitansGo we want to forget. "
"Its normal :) my ex-bf lost his virginity with me when he was 23. So stop ovethinking, there is more to life than sex"
"When a conversation has heterosexual undertones and I dont recognize it. 

“Oh look at her yoga pants”

Inner me: “yoga pants easy and comfy to wear... Wait a minute...  he isnt pointing out how she dressed more comfortable than us”"
"Some humans thrive, others don't. I'm not sure it's a gay thing."
He totally deserved that punch. You did well
I'm 17 and i don't think i'll want a relationship that isn't exclusive between the two of us.
Standing on the street harassing passers-by is better for dating than Grindr
"I do feel like the best part of being in a relationship is the absolute mundane domestic stuff, like discussing where to put furniture. I dunno why, it feels so ""grown up"" :)"
Wait wtf? Who is this man??  There are too many names named Pablo Hernandez in this world...

"I didn't even tell my mom I'd had sex till a few months ago... and I'm 31.

She's known about me being gay since I was 16, and knew I had trouble finding guys (and having strong crushes that tanked badly).

She was actually happy to hear I was using Grindr and getting laid now (and that I'd had sex for the first time at 19), because, in her words, ""I was feeling so bad for you, thinking, 'Oh, he's 31 and he's still a virgin!' No, I'm actually really happy for you!"" It was pretty funny, really. My mom's happy her youngest son's a slut.

(She does know I'm pretty careful, though.)"
"""It's Facebook for gays"".

Phew, close call."
"The only thing that makes it tricky is that his parents are homophobic and have no doubt reinforced the anti-gay language. 
  When my niece was 6, she came home saying the word gay as an insult one day.  Her daddy asked her why she would say something bad about gay people like that.  She asked what gay people really were and he said it’s a man who falls in love with a man or a woman who falls in love with a woman.  Then he asked her to guess who she knows who is gay.  It took her a minute and then she correctly guessed me and mentioned my boyfriend.  
  She is very outspokenly in favor of gay rights now as a teenager. 

  The wrong way to approach this is to say “don’t call people gay” because that suggests that being gay is something bad to be.  The right way is to explain that some people are gay and there is no reason to insult them by using who they are as if it means something bad. "
Cook him and eat him.
I'd feel wrong emptying the dishwasher while using a wooden spoon as a dildo. 
"I am so happy that when I opened this post, it wasn't about feeding fetishes."
"Mortal Kombat, netflix, breakfast burritos, maybe postmates some starbucks? Idk. Ideally that would be fun to me."
"How about a little appreciation?  
It’s hard work being a bottom "
"Fuck, yes!

Had a Portuguese guy last summer. He could hardly understand me, and his English was unintelligible but he was hot and had an enormous penis. "
WTF. Stop being a doormat. You need to work on learning to love yourself before you even think about someone else. This relationship is 2 months old and already you're a mess. He's not into you so leave him and break the cycle before it starts.
"And too far is... not rape?

Just because it wasn't the worst assault you've heard of doesn't mean it wasn't rape by definition."
"Yeah, it was a really good show. 

Too bad cartoon network was shit for a good while after that generation of shows. "
"My mom kicked me out at 17. I ignored her and moved halfway across the country to get away from her. I didn’t answer her phone calls. When I did speak to her, I blatantly told her, “I want nothing to do with you. You’re a hateful, evil woman.” 

By conventional standards, this is a terrible way to treat one’s mom. But I’d hardly call someone a “mom” if they’re willing to dishevel the life of their own child. 

We are better now, and we speak, but there will always be tension there, as there should be. She broke down to me a few months ago crying (I’m 24 now). I simply looked at her and said, “You made me feel worthless. You removed an type of safety net I had. I was a child. You would have rather seen me fail rather than to help me succeed. I will always have cried more tears over you than you have for me. You did this to our relationship. Now you have to learn to live with it. Get over yourself.” I turned around and got in my car and left. I had a feeling she was gonna ask me for money or something (which would be a first, but I know she’s been struggling.

I am licensed CPA with a masters degree, now. I make more than her and her new husband combined. The feeling of accomplishment I get from knowing she couldn’t tear me down, despite her best efforts, is something. 

Move on, dude. It’s a long journey, but don’t forget what she did to you. “When someone shows you their true colors, believe them.”"
This is where you leave your ex. Again. First as a partner and now as a friend. I would never stay close with someone who gives a shit about whatever I tell not to tell to someone else. And also she obviously thinks that her own mind is way more important than yours. Leave her. Again. 
Im introverted so it happens from time to time.
"On a related note, Denmark is working on effectively banning male circumcision up until the age of 18, for *any reason* other than medical."
Tell him you ended it
"That’s because it is rape. The definition is not up for debate.  

Consent is a continuous process and can be withdrawn at any point. My only wish is that more people were like OP instead of just going along for ease or out of politeness. 

And yes, there are probably millions of rapists out there because privileged little shits think that ‘going too far’ during sex is just an etiquette issue as opposed to, you know, sexual assault. "
Pull a rainbow butt plug from your ass and ask “how bout now?”
They don't care about what's attached to the rest of the dick on grindr.
have sibling. can confirm this will work
"envy straight couples? want to be in a straight relationship? god, could you imagine? I would *never*"
"Irritated? No. But I do roll my eyes a bit. Even if you choose not to commit to the gym, there are a thousand and one things you can do to look and feel better. 

Ever seen an average guy get a great haircut and clothes that actually fit their body type? Boom. Maybe you chill on your sugar fetish? Dental hygiene? A great smile and fresh breath go a loooong way. Floss once in a while, dummy. Do you even sunscreen &amp; moisturize bro? I could go on and on. "
This is the most adorable thing I've read in awhile. It almost makes me want to cohabitate with someone and live that domestic life. Almost.
"Smoking

If he smokes ciggies or vapes its an instant and complete turn off"
Listen to this one's advice 👆
Slightly jealous of him tbh.
"It's hot to me. I want them to be enjoying themselves for sure, but them asking to continue being fucked is so hot."
"I agree 100%. Dick piercings are a big nono for me, what if they get *lost*? 💀"
"Any surgery that is performed that does not treat a deformity or illness is technically an injury to the body part affected. The majority of circumcisions are elective. And circumcision is not a first line treatment for any illness or deformity that can't be treated by other means. So it is a mutilation in nearly all cases.

That said, some people like being mutilated. Too many like to impose the mutilation on others. Of course, this is a separate topic and not what you are asking about."
"It’s WAY too long.  More like

Hey

                                    Hey

The end"
"Had so many bottoms tell me that, ""I don't have to"". Lol. Shut up. This is for me. You had your fun sucking me. Its my turn now."
then he probably doesn't label his sexuality. do you have his number or something to contact him? 
Sex is important to me. I wouldve already left. 4x a year is way low. 
"I had plans with a guy I met on Grindr to hook up at night. I texted him when it was the time, but he **ignored** me instead. So I went on Grindr, deleted my account, and registered with a new account. I uploaded a picture of a realistically-hot guy. I got a dozen of messages after that, but I ignored them until I got a message from the same guy who ignored me earlier trying to hook up. I asked him for pictures, and he sent me some of what he considered ""the best"" of his collection. But I told him that he was ugly..., and I can't even consider someone like him. That triggered him, but I calmly pointed out the things that make him look ugly when he asked me why would I say that. He blocked me after that, and the next thing I see is a text message from him on my phone number (the real me) asking for my location. He told me that now he feels ""horny."" But the truth is that the guy's ego was shattered at the time, and he wanted to regain it so bad (just like I planned).  I told him okay no problem; you can come in. I sent him the location. He came to my home. I fucked him; then I ditched him."
He could walk out there in a fucking diaper and they’re like “your smile is beautiful”
"5, across 4 separate encounters on a very abnormal day off.

guy 1: early morning Grindr hookup. we talked the day before and agreed to meet up on his way home after his overnight shift.

guy 2: roommate with benefits. I was napping in bed when he got home from class in the afternoon, and he curled up next to me. we cuddled and slept for like half an hour till he started grinding his butt into my dick. ended up fucking him before he had to go back out for his late afternoon classes.

guy 3+4: around dinnertime, a regular hookup sent me a text that he was playing around with one of his fuck buddies and they were looking for a third. I've never been one to turn down an opportunity, so I drove over to have some fun with them.

guy 5: I was sound asleep alone in bed when my phone started ringing at midnight. it was an old fuck buddy who I hadn't seen in months, saying that he was outside my house because he was driving through my town and really needed a place to pee. when I let him in, he was obviously drunk. I let him do his thing, but took his keys and told him to hang out till he sobered up.

we fell asleep naked in bed together, and a couple hours later I woke up to him giving me a blowjob. "
"Yep , because nobody want to hang out late at night and i only enjoy hanging out at that time , i hate sun and the day and the light , so i’m 24/24 in my dark room "
"My ex said ""no homo tho"" after an amazing fuck. I died. "
That smile!
Why would you starve yourself? A quick douche serves me fine no matter what I’ve eaten. 
"Well keep talking until he stops his internship and then bang him.

easy"
"“Thanks!” 

And keep walking like 90% of the human population would. 🤷‍♂️"
"My ""tell"", such as it is, is that I tell people ""I'm gay."""
"My first time topping, right at the end when I came, the guy I was fucking pounded the pillow with his fist (we were doing doggy-style) and went ""Oh my god, BEST. DICK. *EVER.*"" It was so cute and unexpected that I couldn't help but laugh.

We also had a laugh a little before that, when it took me a moment to process that he wanted to 69, and we poked some fun at it.

Man, that was just one of my best hookups ever, really. Guy was a kind of underwhelming kisser, but everything else was awesome."
Absolutely!
"This, then I started watching gay porn for the dude and the other dude(s). It's much more efficient "
"I've actually been doing this a lot lately. Sometimes straight porn actors just have this......idk more ""realistic"" feeling to them."
"I mean if complete strangers think that after one or two words out of your mouth, probably everyone you know suspects you are gay already. "
Holy water enema coming right up
"Harry Potter movie playing in the background  and I hear, “Leviosuuuuuuhhh”. 

His cat pouncing on him while he’s topping."
I'm also voting that you do this. Your brother is a piece of shit.
"I feel like I'm not masculine enough for guys who like masculine guys, but not feminine enough for guys who like feminine guys. I think when people say they want a ""masc"" dude, they want a dude who acts without any type of ""gay"" inflections (for lack of a better term) or who don't present themselves in a stereotypically feminine way. I also notice guys who say they like fem dudes tend to prefer the softer, slimmer types who might cross dress, wear make up, or present themselves in that stereotypical way.

I am neither of those. You can tell I'm gay the moment I talk, but if I'm just sitting there, or walking, or pretty much doing anything that doesn't involve me expressing myself, I look like any straight dude you might see out yonder. So ya. I think I can relate to this post a bit."
I have zero interest in watching RPDR.
"I dated one. 

*""Just because I watched underage pornography and the guys I fucked around with before you all look 15 doesn't mean anything! It's just the way I am!""*

I shook my head till my neck hurt after that shitshow."
"Yesss!!! My boyfriend speaks English as a second language and while it's almost flawless, sometimes he makes mistakes or just messes up and it's sooo adorable idk why ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
I don't get the problem with living with housemates though. A guy told me he couldn't host cos of his housemate. Why?? What the hell? Are we not all adults?
"I love how they say they're a top as an excuse.

""Like I'm supposed to be abusive 🤪"""
Have you tried finding gay friends who are just as ugly as you?
I’m crying
I caught some testicular cancer last year. Had my right nut removed in January. I had low t but I think that's better now. Its not something you should feel you need to disclose because it doesn't affect the other person but don't take it personal if they react to it. I didn't even get a prosthetic but the only time it's super obvious is after a hot shower. The rest of the time it mostly looks like I have two. It's been about six months since my surgery.
So your friend is obviously gay. Think of all the gay porn he's watched to click on something with someone he knows.......
"My heart.


:(


^^^^^metaphorically"
I’m a big fan of convincing horrible guys to dump someone for the sake of the other guy. 
"To rub it in even further you could say your mate saw it happen too, that's when you introduce your bf to your parents, as the mate who can back up your story. Then you can hang out with your bf, and your brother won't be able to say shit without sounding like a complete liar."
"Hahaha!
This is what a lot of people strive for!"
It's my favorite...meanwhile he's got a different kind of sugar on his mind!
My brother is a young dad(23) and recently broke up with his baby mama. So every time we go out with his kid people think we are a couple. Some lady even came up to us and said she supported us. We also get all types of weird looks at the mall. Some dude even said gay while simultaneously coughing while walking passed us. My brother blames me cause I’m gay but its really his fault. He looks gay too
"Sexting with a stranger on facebook , reading the texts after cumming was psychological torture "
"I walked into my sister's room and she was playing on her ps4 in her room whilst on a call with her friend, i said one maybe two words. And her friend was instantly like ""is your brother gay?"" And i thought to myself ""damn! That quick!"""
"""But if everyone was gay, there would be no more children, and the human race would die out."" "
"Beating off with another guy is already the gayest shit there is, your friend is probably more queen than you are lmao"
It looks dirty and most times men don't take good care of it.
Called a friend and begged him to let me blow him. After that we slowly stopped talking to each other.
They just need gay housemates. I've walked past a living room of gay room mates to fuck a guy in his room. 
But be sure to ask him first before you do it!
"""He had two marijuanas and now he's a homosexualist."""
Shawn Mendes. Oh wait.
You’re right... I am gay.
"I would agree, for me as well. It's all about taste, I'm sure there are those who are the complete opposite as well."
If that's normal to you I want to live in your world!
can you be made a saint while you're still alive? somebody call the vatican 
"Monogamy is what i want out if a relationship, and non-monogamy is a deal breaker. I’m in an exclusive relationship and could not have it any differently. I don’t think open is the majority"
I would feel really attacked
"I like shy guys, especially those inexperienced with sex. It's like a game getting them to break out of their shells."
"Two days before Thansgiving I was given my fwb a blowjob and all of sudden he says gobble gobble. I couldn't stop laughing for a solid ten minutes. And to this day, we still laugh about it."

"How about, before you do it, you set some ground rules? If they don't like it, you might not get any, but at the same time it would avoid this problem."
Raven had big dick energy 
LOL!
"I think the guys saying ‘dump his fat ass’ are a little extreme. If you love this guy (and you say that you do) he deserves to know how you feel. Maybe word it so that you say you’re worried about his health and (having been bigger in the past like you mentioned) what it can do to your confidence and mental health. 

Tell him you’re going to help him lose some weight and eat a little healthier. If that doesn’t work then just be brutally honest: you won’t find him physically attractive anymore. 

If it still doesn’t work and you can no longer continue, *then* dump his fat ass. "
"Plot twist: you’ll never be satisfied with your body. You’ll get to a point where everyone compliments it, but all you’ll see in the mirror is a malformed, maligned creature. I might just be projecting here though, so..."
Jesus why would you do all of that to bottom?
How much better it is dating men over women.
"I know quite a few guys who had their first sexual experience in their late 20s. There is really no pressure though, virginity is just a social construct. It's your sex life, you can have or not have sex when and with whomever you please."
Really liked the show. Didn't budge my feelings on monogamy at all. 
"Dealing with angry parents will be tough - but if you seriously think that they will lock you up or send you to a church/conversion camp, please know that there are resources out there to help you and where you can go to get away from this. I think you should also call a LGBT hotline for advice -- they probably deal with people who have parents like you all the time and can tell you how to handle things. Check out [https://bornthisway.foundation/get-help-now](https://bornthisway.foundation/get-help-now) and click *LGBTQIA+ + Questioning.*"
Go watch some japanese gay porn then lol
There’s a difference between needing it removed for religous reasons and for medical reasons. For instance if you needed your leg amputated for medical reasons everyone would be fine with it but if a religion said at birth the kids leg needs to be chopped off then it’s mutilation and should be stopped. 
"That grin you have is going to last all weekend, too.   "
If you want to brag about your experience don't make up a dumb question as a post title and then just never refer to it again. 
21 seems really young.  I'm still a virgin at 30 :/.
I’ve never seen a straight woman on Grindr 
"Yeah, I do feel like this sometimes. And people on here and in real life will try to shame you for it, but it's a completely valid thought. "
That seems dismissive and a thing pretty people say to feel less guilty or whatever
"I tell my bottoms not to worry about cleaning too much. Just my preference though. We use a condom and if it’s not perfectly clean, who cares? It’s anal. "
That cough person is trapped in a middle school class in 2002. Very sad. 
Religion is just a more sophisticated way of saying cult. 
Not against gays necessarily but it's implied I suppose: I told someone I didn't ever want kids and he said I was a disgrace because it's my constitutional duty to my country to procreate. Lol
"Bingo.  If someone is unhappy after 3 months, it's time to go.

Most people who ask for advice on this sub are between the age of 15 and 25 and their relationships are usually a few weeks to a few months old."

Because everyone knows that the pretty gays drain the life essence from the less attractive in order to stay pretty.
"Bro... Being homophobic is one thing but making someone drink your semen is completely worse. Please for anyone who read this, don't do this shit. If anyone found out, they could definitely press charges. "

Wait, did you mean literally, or..."
"The other day, I saw this guy who was wearing pink, skinny capris. I'm at least 90% sure he was gay.

Not long ago, there was a something-teen kid with his mom at the grocery store. I'm pretty muscular, and I was coming from the gym, so I was in an athletic tank top. I definitely caught this kid's eye. I don't think he realized how blatant he was about it. Kid was definitely gay.

I sometimes hold hands with or kiss my boyfriend when in public. This offers up subtle clues to anyone who might be watching that my boyfriend is, in fact, a homosexual.

I've had guys over my house a few dozen times, and they fucked me in the ass. They were all probably at least bi, but I may just be seeing things that aren't actually there."
"Really, this is the answer. 

It’s our space. You’re not unwelcome, but respect it. When I was invited to a Passover Sadr as a Christian, I didn’t try to convert the Jews there. I appreciated being welcomed, and treated everyone with respect and friendship. 

Any straight person in a gay bar or at a Pride should do the same. 

It’s when straight girls turn out bars into Bachelorette party destinations and they take every front seat at a drag show and not tip or touch guys because “they’re hot” that I get annoyed. 

I’ve been inappropriately touched by way more women than men at a gay bar, to the order of 2:1. No. "
"Dump his ass, If you have proof that he did do something and walked in on him. I wouldn't try and reach out to her because that's just gonna get messy for everyone and seem like your depressed. Walk away now while you can"
"Seriously? The ones I see on here are the ones who should have dumped their asses months ago. ""Oh my bf is literally sleeping at some random gay guy's house because it's too inconvenient to come home after work. what should i do?""

""Oh my bf cheated on me but he only jerked off with the guy. Does it really count as cheating and should I give him a second chance?""

And other stuff like that. Personally I think most of this sub is so *desperate* for a relationship that when they finally get in one, the fuckers refused to see any red flags because they finally got their white masc big dicked boyfriend and refuse to break up with him and lose their prize that they ""deserve"".

But this is just my opinion."
I personally find it a huge turn-on. Just looks very attractive to me.
"All the time. I like the size difference between the man and woman and the dominance of the man. 

Gay porn where it's just two white jocks (sean cody, southern strokes, ...) is so boring"
"You're a side, and that's fine! I've had a lot of fun with sides, they usually have a much better appreciation of sex beyond ""penis in butt"", and that's very attractive to me "
"Thank you for this, definitely helpful. "
"It happened to me once when I was 19 and living in Vancouver. I was walking down Davie St. (Gay neighborhood) and this guy that was walking in front of me turned around and started walking backwards looking at me. I just smiled and walked past him. It was flattering tbh, but he was older so I wasn't really interested. "
I’m so happy to hear that.  It’s a big relief to be able to “be yourself” around your friends. Congratulations! 
"I heard this on reddit a while back. It’s genius!

When you are alone with him, talking about mundane things- small talk. Casually slip in “Do you know my friend Sean Cody?” 

Check to see what his reaction is. If he widens his eyes or makes any type of wow expression he’s gay.

If he asks whose Sean Cody. You can pass off the question as a regular “I think I know you from somewhere type of thing” 

No straight guy is going to know who Sean Cody is unless they’re a porn actor. "
"This! I’ve never understood that dumb requirement about your hookup needing his own place. It’s never bothered me when someone has roommates, as long as there’s an acceptable degree of privacy 🤷🏽‍♂️"

"Don't abuse your job dealing with this matter, but you should definitely reaffirm that what he was doing was fucked up."
It's not ok to be conservative.
"as someone that works in finance heres my advice to you:

* start with a prenup that says in the case of a divorce you both take away what you bring into the marriage.
* merge your bank accounts so you both pitch into one account. this means any dinners you go to it doesn't matter who pays as it comes from the same account. this alos helps with your mortgage issues because you can look and think of  a mortagage that makes sense for your combined income. START THINKING IN TERMS OF COMBINED INCOME and not ""my"" income and ""his"" income.
* the best practice is both of you decide on a &amp;#37; to save (say 25&amp;#37; of each paycheck) that goes into your own savings/retirement account and the rest into the merged bank account.

ive seen the finances of a few married couples and this works the best and helps avoid the 50/50 my money/your money issues because believe me with such an income discrepancy you will run into issues with separate bank accounts."
"Besides the obvious? I don’t think that straight people can fully understand what it’s like to try to change, suppress, and hide your sexual orientation."
"What's ""big dick energy""? Like they have the equivalent forwardness that someone with a big dick has? Or they have the energy to handle and fully satisfy a big dick? Or both?"
"If he wakes up everyday making a conscious choice to be straight,  he's probably not straight. Seriously, trust me on this one.

The only argument I ever got is I had a girl tell me ""you're just confused and dont know what you want."" Boy howdy that got under my skin. "
"My ex-bf used to throw invitation-only (because people try bringing their friends or not-equally hot boyfriends and stuff) sex parties so we get to set the rules:

\- Only safe aka condom's a must.

\- No dissociative or hallucinative drugs. (Go trip somewhere else) - byob for the rest

\- Bottoms must douche.

\- You gotta fuck at least 3 guys if it's your first time. Can't just watch.

\- No phones or anything with a camera.

\- No clothes in the playroom (a jockstrap or a very minor fetish wear like harness is okay - no full body latex suit extravaganza).

Other than that common sense was enough. Like don't try to fuck someone if they're not having it from you."
"Long out now, but I was watching porn when I heard one of my parents coming home. Cliche as hell, the browser froze up and wouldn't close. Frantic, out of options, I turned the screen off before they walked in. I don't remember what my excuse for sitting in front of the computer with the screen off was."
"Awesome! I’m gay too, and I remember coming out to my parents - that wasn’t easy, but totally worth it! So happy for your little brother 🏳️‍🌈"
"That sounds really odd. If he doesn’t have any issues ie ED, depression, etc. then it’s a major red flag. It doesn’t sound like you’re happy. Sex is more than just getting off, it’s the most intimate thing you can do with another human and it’s a big component to feeling emotionally connected. "
"Anyone who is telling you to straight up leave him are idiots, don’t listen to them. What you need to do is STOP sexting other guys on Grindr (and possibly sending them nudes as well), and talk to your man about how you’re feeling. Communication is key!!!"
"""YAAAAAS KWEEEEN SLAAAAAAAY"" is not feminine, it's a caricature of an idea of femininity, same as drag. 

Feminine is not being afraid to talk about feelings, having the guts to use words like pretty, cute, adorable, listening to music other than harsh rap, etc. Being ok with crying... to me these things show that someone is comfortable in their skin, and signals they're probably self confident and strong willed (They don't care how people perceive them)"
"I'm kind of in the same position as you. He is very extroverted, I'm very introverted, but I'm comfortable mostly listening to what he has to say, and throwing in questions and opinions that show that I listen to him. 

Being comfortable whilst alone with him is key, in my case"

I actually think this would work tbh lol
"Go bare. Never go bare people, even if he’s on prep. "
"The thing is, a lot of gay kids in your class probably don't know they're gay yet. If they do, they might be in the process of coming to terms with it. That makes calling out homophobia whenever you hear it really important because the other kids aren't going to speak up. As the adult in the room, that falls to you. Always assume there is at least one kid there who is gay, even if none are out. 

Beyond that, you can try to make your lessons inclusive to help normalize being gay for the kids in the room. You didn't mention the subject you teach, but if it's english or history it's fairly easy to incorporate. Math or science might be a bit harder and could come off as forced so I wouldn't attempt it. 

Lastly, there are stickers and posters you can put around your classroom to indicate that it is a safe space, that you are an ally, and that kids can come talk to you if they need to. "

"I was circumcised and hold no Ill will towards my parents. It was for medical reasons and I presume at the time (early 1990s) circumcision was considered the best treatment.

While I support a movement towards ending the practice, I’d prefer people didn’t treat it like a disfigurement or some kind of abomination. People (myself included) have enough body issues to deal with and this is one that at least for now they don’t have to feel self conscious about."
"Yes, it is. I'm not American and it amazes me how common this is in the United States. "
"As a moderately pretty gay I can tell you it's not all it's cracked up to be.

Examples include:
If someone hits on you and you don't respond, they can get angry or downright psycho. 

Some others may view you as a threat and talk shit about you to others. 

Some people will only try to date you as a trophy and will drop you if someone prettier comes along

Sometimes it's really lonely because if you are viewed as too unattainable no one will even try

It messes with your psyche if you go from fat and ugly to good looking. I had trouble when I got thin with basically turning into an attention whore because I'd never had any number of people hitting on me. 

Some people will try to be your friend only to see if they can eventually get you in bed or date you, then drop you after they fail. (Plus talk shit after) 

It's better to have a great personality and stay fit and healthy for YOU not anyone else. Your friend may pull more guys than you, but you'll pull quality ones. 

Listen to 32 Flavors by Ani Difranco, there's a line in the song that goes


""God help you if you are an ugly girl
'Cause too pretty is also your doom
'Cause everyone harbors a secret hatred
For the prettiest girl in the room
And god help you if you are a phoenix
And you dare to rise up from the ash
A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy
While you are just flying past""

Just you be you my man, and good things will come.

No. The rules are much stricter for men. You suck one dick in college and people assume you’re gay for life.

"The whole ""Shawn Mendes (or any celebrity for that matter) is gay"" gag is very tiring, especially when said person has explicitly said that they aren't.

"He is an adult and can ultimately do what he wants. I would have a civil conversation with him, expressing your concerns but also willing to listen and accept that he can make his own choices, even ones you disagree with. That’s just part of being his own person. In any case I wouldn’t tell him you saw the video. No guy wants to hear his parents saw him having sex. It was really crappy of your “friend” to just send you the link like that. There were better ways of handling that."

"I was home alone thinking everyone else was at work for the day. Had a friend over and while I was riding him, I hear the front gate open. My dad was off from work and had just gone to Walmart. Thank god he went into his room. We bolted out and I took my friend home. Later, my dad asked whose shoes that was outside. Oh, those were my yard work shoes. "

"Yep, strangely I really enjoy the routine of our relationship. 90% of the time during the weekdays I know exactly when we'll be doing what. That might be very boring to some, but I find it quite exciting."
"It is but nowhere near to the evil shit that happens to women. Imagine having the head of your dick cut off and most of your ballsack removed. That's akin to female ""circumcision"". Only it's done so they know no pleasure or gratification. They're merely seen as a means of procreation. Oddly enough gay sex is rampant in the same countries that do this to women. Men are for pleasure and women for reproduction. They just aren't allowed to love the men they fuck."
"My partner and I are both &gt; 6’5” and we both have beards. “Are you brothers?” happens all the time. That’s not the weird part.

"Anytime someone mentions a problem in their relationship people immediately tell them to leave their partner. 😂

Maybe you could start the conversation by framing it around him. Tell him you can see that he has become more self conscious after gaining a little bit of weight and you want him to be confident and comfortable again so start exercising. You want to have a sex life and both of you feeling confident is a part of that."

"I think there are a few concrete steps you should take.

1. Make sure you’re home is a safe, accepting environment. Your son may not be gay, but it should still be made clear that it would not be an issue.

2. DO talk to your wife. Although it may seem like it could save your son from embarrassment by hiding this, your also hiding something from your wife, which can be viewed as not trusting her. I would make sure to have this conversation when your son will not be present for a period and ensure you will not contact him until both of you decide on how you want to approach this.

3. After reaching a plan going forward, have a conversation with your son. The key part of this is actually conversing. Listen and understand what your son is saying. My best advice is actively listen to what he says, then ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand what he’s saying correctly, then finally offer a reply. If you detect the conversation is becoming heated or at a sticking point, be willing to take a break. “I think we’re/I’m getting too emotional, do you want to take a break and resume this later?” Make sure to clearly lay out your true concerns, likely safety, career impact, and social impact. Don’t assume he hasn’t thought of these items, but make it clear you’re confirming he has.

Feel free to reply if you have any questions."

"I think Dahmer has the market cornered on deadly first dates.

Really though, I recommend a picnic or a car ride. Best date I ever had was a 2 or 3 hour (I can't remember) ride just meandering through the surrounding area because we couldn't decide what to do. It gave us time to talk and get comfortable with one another. 

Plus, it was nice to be spontaneous. "
What did they do wrong?  They made them aware of something happening in their sons life.   This could help to open dialogue between the parent and son and hopefully allow a healthy open way for him to come out.
Por que no los dos?
"Yeah, personally, I hate them. I dont like the look."
My opinion.....let her go. I personally wouldn't wanna be with someone who would throw me out like trash. BUT if you really wanna reconcile. FORCE her to talk about throwing you out....if it makes her too uncomfortable....it's a good sign that she doesn't feel bad about it...and it's a good sign that it's not worth being around. Because my opinion is....if you want to hurt me and pretend it didn't happen...you probably are a bad person and will hurt me again. 
"So here's how I see it: 

To me, gay bars (and other LGBT spaces) are, first and foremost, places for gay people to meet one another. If you're a straight person going to a gay bar, you absolutely need to be sensitive to that - you're a guest in the house of gay.

If you're a straight person going to a gay bar specifically so you can act out your impressions of gay stereotypes however, you can fuck right off. That is not even remotely OK. *We are not here for your fucking amusement*.

Like, if that were my mom, I be less *embarassed* and more *angry*."

Congrats on the sex
"You just don't 'get' the concept of consent do you? We're not splitting hairs to decide some kind of punishment or something. It's simply a fact that there was:

1) no predetermined safe word to justify not stopping on 'stop'

2) an instance where one party said 'stop'

3) the result of the other party ignoring that and not stopping

This is an open and shut case of rape. It doesn't ***matter*** how you personally feel about rape being falsely accused. This is literal textbook rape. Your counterargument literally cannot overcome the damning 'asked to stop, didn't stop' situation.

The sex before this point was consensual. ANYTHING after that point was rape. You're getting mass downvoted because this is a fundamental thing that everybody should and needs to know. If you do what OP's rapist did, you will be prosecuted almost immediately after the above prospect is raised in court. There are no valid differing 'opinions' of what happened here.

Also, how is saying 'it was for certain rape. No doubt about it' being ""grey"" or ""not an absolute definition"". That's EXACTLY what has been said to you by several people now - there *is* no grey area here, you'd have to be morally and criminally colour-blind to see a grey here. OP said he didn't feel violated - bully for him, thats a good thing, but it changes NOTHING about the crime committed. That crime was still performed. The victim's desire to press charges has nothing to do with whether you committed a crime.

If I murdered your sister, but you were estranged and hated her, so you don't care about her death, and are the only living relative around to care, will I still be convicted of murder if it is brought to trial? And the trial runs with evidence and witness statements that are completely damning (coincidentally just like the concept of 'told to stop, didn't stop')? Am I still guilty of murder? Absolutely.

A real life example in the extreme is the german cannibal. His victim was very willing, but he was still charged for his *crimes*. Because he performed criminal acts and those acts deserve punishment.

Here's the definition of rape in a legal sense - things that must be fulfilled to justify proceedings being organised to prosecute. I'll append it down to the relevant point:

&gt; A criminal offense defined in most states as forcible sexual relations with a person against that person's will.

Here, now I will define 'stop':

&gt; Prevent or dissuade (someone) from continuing in an activity or achieving an aim.

Now here's 'consent' in regards to rape, in legal terms:

&gt; In the context of rape, there must be a choice between resistance and acquiescence. If a woman (or man) resists to the point where additional resistance would be futile or until her resistance is forcibly overcome, submission thereafter is not consent.

By saying stop, there is resistance without acquiescence. Consent was rescinded. You are allowed to back out of consent and yiur sexual partner is legally obliged to back off, lest they become a perpetrator of rape.

I really just don't get how you can't see that. Saying this is rape isn't like saying that a drunk guy mistakenly peeing in a bush near a school at night is a sexual predator offense. That type of thing is bullshit. This is not. One party said stop and rescinded their consent. The other party continued.

It was rape. Accept it. Case closed."

It may also be an excellent experiment to see just how often he comes to my desk then haha"
"Yup. I don't think my mom could handle it, honestly. She would worry herself to death. "
"Canada, perfectly legal. "
"&gt;Sometimes straight porn actors just have this......idk more ""realistic"" feeling to them.

Agreed. I think because the point of straight porn is for the straight guys at home watching to be able to imagine themselves as that guy or in their place. So, other than them all having huge dicks, i think they go for casting guys who look a little more normal and not like models. Obviously straight porn has males that look like the typical model, but in general i feel straight porn has much more allowance for having guys that just look like an average dude you'd see on the street or might know in your friend group. Cause ultimately the focus is on the girl. Where as with gay porn, every gay porn actor in studio porn has the same general idealized looks. The perfect muscle guy, perfect twink, perfect bear, perfect daddy. There's almost no gay studio porn where the guys just look like real regular average joe's. There's nothing wrong with those guys, but it definitely gets repetitive after a while."
We can just hide it better. Some of us. 
"It's a good thing not everyone is gay then! 

XP"
"I’ve hooked up with a guy with one ball and he didn’t disclose. Another guy I hooked up with recently had his removed but got the fake one, he casually mentioned it during sex but I wouldn’t have cared or noticed if he hadn’t. I didn’t find it relevant in either case, it’s not super noticeable and has essentially zero effect on sex. "
"Subject: ""My Boyfriend Ghosted Me""

""We haven't met up yet but I've been chatting with this guy on Grindr all week and I really think he's The One. He hasn't responded to my last message, and that was a whole two hours ago. Should I try to figure out where he lives so I can throw pebbles at his window to win him over?"""
No but my brother and I get mistaken as a couple.
"If you're not fem then you're pretty much masc by default. The easy way to tell what you are is if people assume you're gay within 30 seconds of meeting you, you're probably fem."
...and call someone a troll when they don't agree with them.
"Self worth is a far more complicated thing. Upbringing, environment, education, marketing, discrimination and a whole lot more. writing it off as a simple effort to change can be quite unfair. I do agree though that we as people tend to bitch easily. I also had to adapt a solution based approch to life but it took me some time to get there"
"This comment just made me die a little. Guy I had a huge huge crush on at college nearly 20 years ago, asking me if I had a girlfriend, saying he wouldn’t mind if I was gay, asking me to come round to his house one night to smoke weed...I just had a bit of a realisation that 18 year old me missed"
Does your brother hate you so much that he'd be fine ruining your life? I'm torn because at 16 you do have a lot to lose by telling your parents if you think they'll send you away or disown you. 
Foreplay is a lost art form.. should never be underestimated!
"We've been together for 5 years total, living together almost 2 years now. I still jump on him like a sex-starved man when I see him after work. Plus, I wanna get it in before eating dinner for multiple reasons. My favorite is when he actually texts me to come home at lunch for a quickie, it's soooo good."
"""I don't know who YOU are anymore. I could have sworn you weren't an asshole 5 minutes ago"""
"This. Is. Me. 
I just want to find the right guy! "
"Just go for a drink or a coffee. If you want to impress or do something out of the ordinary, save it for the second date. "
"That most arguments of today rely too heavily on emotional value and anecdotes while not giving much thought to the actual facts. Fuck your feelings, it's time someone spoke purely from rationality and common sense."
I need a man like you in my life lmao
Because it is crazy. We all know 9inches usually means 7.5 or 8 most of the time. 8 is like top one percent already

There are medical reasons to get circumcised later in life though. 
"&gt; I do really empathise with this person

Empathy is *why* I can't sit there and listen to people bitch about their lives. I soak up emotions. If you're being negative, that affects me, and I can't be around that too long or it gets me down too."
There is someone for everyone.  
"I actually know what you mean, in the sense that I can be speaking to someone and have the realisation that they view me differently to others "
"Work hard on the things you can change to improve yourself, and accept the things you can't. Easier said than done I know, but it's much kinder to yourself. Try not to take it out on your attractive friend though - it's not his fault he's so pretty :-)"
Wow you don’t LOOK ignorant 
Yes it does. Try having sex while high. That shit is good.
"I'm not sure if I'd be able to handle rejection from a guy and deal with the aftermath. Im not from the US or any part of the world considered ""western"" so if he told anyone it would be pretty bad. "
Why didn't you just own up to it? Seemed like an accepting environment
