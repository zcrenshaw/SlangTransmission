"Thank you for this explanation, it's spot on.

Even though Brie Larson's tweet was overreactive and not an example of sexual harassment, I understand her frustration. Women get hit on all the time - regardless of what we are doing - and not only is it goddamn tiring, we never know how the person will react. 

Because just saying that it's tiring isn't enough for women to be believed, here's a scenario some of you might be able to empathize with: You know how awkward and annoying it is when someone on the street asks you for money? Imagine if people bigger and stronger than you asked you for money on a semi-regular basis, regardless of where you are. Most of these people are harmless, but you've heard a lot of stories of them getting aggressive when rejected. You might have even experienced it yourself once or twice (or more).

And now you're at the grocery store after working a long, stressful day at work, just trying to get your shit done and leave because you're tired and over it all. You're trying to choose the least dried looking rotisserie chicken when randomly glance across the store and - oh fuck - you just locked eyes with someone who was clearly staring at you.  Maybe you instinctively smiled, maybe you smiled; sometimes it doesn't matter, because some of these people need the barest amount of recognition to feel entitled to your money. What this person looks like doesn't matter, what matters is that they're bigger and stronger than you. This is the last thing you feel like dealing with and you silently pray they don't approach you. You try to keep your face neutral, maybe a little scowl, purposely make your body language closed off and busy looking. But they do approach, because this person is literally ignoring every single one of your ""fuck off"" cues because of that one cue they decided to interpret as a go ahead.

They start talking to you and now you're locked in a conversation you could barely give a fuck out about with someone you don't care about it, and now they're clearly skirting around asking you for money. Your excuse is itching at the back of your throat, though if you say it too soon the person may balk and turn it around on you. However, if you say it too late, the person may accuse you of leading them on in thinking you'd give them money.

On top of this, you're monitoring the person's tone, body language, words, and mannerisms. Does this person appear stable? Are respecting your personal space? If they're being too aggressive or inappropriate, you might need to be more assertive to show that you have boundaries and being too passive could make you look like an easy victim. But you can't be *too* assertive, because they might get upset and, again, they are bigger and stronger than you.

Finally, 3 minutes in, the stranger gets to the point and asks you if you have any money and your excuse is out immediately: ""Sorry, I don't have any cash."" This is a lie - you do have cash, you're just avoiding the awkward situation of explaining why you do not want to give them cash, even though it's entirely within your right to not want to. The stranger smiles and tells you it's fine, and to have a nice day. The interaction ends.

And most of those interactions end that way. Maybe the person is more awkward or pushy, but for the most part the person leaves and you can be on your way. But sometimes they don't. You've had people call you a stuck up asshole. More than one person has tried to physically intimidate you. Once, someone tried to grab your wallet to prove that you had money. You have a friend that was beaten and robbed after they told someone no.

So even though that *particular* person wasn't shitty about being turned down, you still had to go through all the exhausting mental steps of predicting how they would react and adjusting your response accordingly. You had to deal with it even though it was the last thing you wanted to do, all because you decided to exist in a public space and appeared to have money.

This is what women deal with constantly. It's exhausting and annoying, and I'm tired of women being criticized for saying it's exhausting and annoying."
"I generally dislike Reddit's habit of saying ""bail"" at the slightest relationship problem, but yeah, bail.

The problem here isn't that she doesn't want to have sex, the problem here is that she wants to end the relationship, and wants it to be your fault.

The way she's doing it, she can say ""oh, I was totally committed, but that degenerate made it all about sex while I tried to walk with Christ"".

Sorry, bro, but you need to bail."
They’ve got juice boxes and snacks. 
"What the fuck. If he won’t do it in the bathroom, get a squirt bottle and spray him with water if he does it again, he’ll learn "
This is probably one of the best examples of what it’s like. Especially the appropriate time to give an excuse or to say no. I couldn’t tell you how many times I’ve been accused to being stuck up or thinking highly of myself for saying no too fast or being called a bitch for leading someone on because I didn’t start the conversation with me having a bf. It is exhausting and being critical of your own actions afterwards. Did I smile too much? Was I over animated while talking about something I enjoy and it gave the wrong impression? Should I have just given one word answers and not treated them as a person? It’s hard to not question yourself when it happens often and trying to prevent it. 
"Don't test your partner.  This bugs me to no end.  If you have a problem, say it.  But don't project your insecurities onto me."

"I got denied to use the bathroom at work on my floor, because only 3 out of 30 people in our location are male, so instead of sharing the 3 available bathrooms (2 downstairs, 1 upstairs) among all employees, the men always must to go downstairs. 

According to our HR department, the females don't want to share 'their' bathrooms because men are allegedly less hygienic. However, the only time when the men's bathroom has been nasty was on a day that I was the only guy in the office, and the light in the adjacent female bathroom was broken.

As a silent protest, I still take a huge dump on the banned 1st floor toilet when I am last to leave the floor on any given day. "
"Clean yourself *thoroughly*.

* Trim your pubes - I use [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-ES246AC-Womens-Bikini-Trimmer/dp/B00005JS5C/ref=sr_1_10_s_it?s=drugstore&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507752153&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=bikini+trimmer) on setting 3.
* Shave - anywhere his/her mouth might go, get rid of the pubic hair. I do a little shaping around the shaft, my balls, and my ass. All it takes is a clean razor and some shaving cream, it's not fucking rocket science.
* Shower - don't just stand in the water for 30 seconds and rub your chest with soap like an idiot. Use a fucking loofah or a decent washcloth, soap it up, and scrub EVERYTHING. Start with your head (NOT JUST YOUR FACE, EVERYTHING ON YOUR ENTIRE HEAD THAT IS NOT HAIR) and work down all the way to your toes. Be PARTICULARLY thorough with your odor areas - armpits, pubic area. Also - get some soap on your hands and work your goddamn asshole. You're worse at wiping than you think.
* Once you're out, try yourself but again, do it thoroughly - damp = funky smells. Dry your hair too. Bonus; wipe the inside of your ears.
* Nails and toenails. Clip or file them. You do not want to be scratching the insides of bodies.
* If you moisturize with some decent quality stuff, your skin will feel all the better for it (both for you and for whoever is rubbing up against you) and your 40 year old self will thank you if you do it consistently, plus you'll smell better. MORE IMPORTANTLY - not moisturizing will make your skin dehydrated, which will then produce extra oil to compensate. And since your shitty diet is leaking nasty BO stank out through your pores, minimising this is a good thing.
* If you're going to use scent, use it minimally and use something decent. Don't walk around smelling like a middle school changing room. I've gotten consistently good reactions from using 'Truth CK Men'. Don't spray directly on your skin, and apply it only after you've moisturized - I spray a few folded pieces of toilet tissue at close range, and rub onto my wrists, my neck and behind my ears.
* Floss well, brush your teeth WELL, scrape your tongue, and use some mouthwash after. Trust me, it makes a huge goddamn difference.

A lot of this stuff can be easily worked into your daily/weekly routine anyway, so it doesn't take a whole lot of time out of your schedule to get ready. And even if you go all out, from stepping into my bathroom a hairy, smelly mess, to out the door cleaned, dried and dressed is only about 30 minutes - maybe 40 if I'm taking my time."
Great to bring visibility to the issue.  But one of the people I saw post it randomly kissed me without consent when I didn’t want her to for example. Guess you could say I find it... incomplete.

"Defibrillators aren't magical life-restarting machines. They're quite literally almost *never* used correctly in TV and film. I know it's a great plot point, but I think it's giving a lot of people potentially dangerous ideas about what these things actually.

If a patient has flatlined, using a Defibrillator isn't going to do anything but mildly barbecue their corpse."
"About 5 minutes.  I was at a party in college and was in the mood to play guitar because I was wasted, and there was one there so I took advantage.  I didn't wanna be the ""guitar guy"" at the party so I found an empty room, went in and shut the door.  This room was apparently by the bathroom, as in the middle of my playing a woman entered the room and told me she heard me playing on her way there.  She asked me to play a song for her, and I was a little nervous because she was amazingly beautiful, but I wasn't gonna not play her a song, ya know?  I played her a song that I wrote and immediately afterwards, with no hesitation asked me if I wanted to go back to her place a block down the road.  I accepted, she took my hand and we immediately left to her dorm.  We banged, then went back to finish the party.  It was an amazing night and I somehow got amazingly lucky, and nothing like that will probably ever happen again.  I don't want this story to be misconstrued as me being a stud, hahah.  Nothing like that has ever happened before that or after.

"I just can't fucking stand my life anymore.  I'm expected to do way too much with too little time, and I have no way to destress. I don't have time to work out anymore, my schedule doesn't sync up with any of my friends' schedules, and I don't drink or smoke.  

Just fuck it, man.  Fuck it to hell. "

"I have a document that says I’m required to report to my government in case the armed forces need me. To get it, I had to be dismissed from serving the armed forces in the first place, otherwise I would have been forced to join. Not doing so would have been cause for imprisonment. Notwithstanding, not having that document means I wouldn’t be able to issue other documents (eg. a passport). Not showing up in case the government needs me may result in prison. 

Where I come from, no woman has that document nor will they face charges in times of war. "

"That whole ""Nothing is wrong"" crap.

I know it's a stereotype that men don't talk about our feelings, but the truth is we want to, if we love you we want to share it with you, and this ""Nothing I'm fine"" and ""It doesn't matter"" crap over any small thing really makes talking and confiding in someone difficult, regardless of gender

I think women don't like to think of men as emotional, but we are and we need help and support like you, we just have a much harder time showing it and expressing it due to social expectations

Now add to that,  a woman who overreacts and refuses to talk about feelings on something trivial and you have a man who wants to express himself but is afraid of being dismissed and rejected. "
"My ex-girlfriend was a real bitch. My mates don't understand that she was really fuckin mean and nasty. She made me cry a lot within the relationship which is a pretty hard thing to do, just he really knew how to hit the sweet spot and hurt a person. 

We broke up two weeks ago and I regret not telling her she was a bitch. We broke up over the phone, which pissed her off, and to make it worse i rejected her invitation of friendship and notion we could get back together in the future. After that she just let it rip with all the mean things she could ever say. 

She's 25, Has anger issues, Jobless, a stoner and thinks the sun shines out her arse. 

It doesn't. "
"Huge boobs, like basketball sized or bigger."

"I think the problem is context, and context. For one, women have to live with this behavior, commonly from what I hear from my friends, day in and day out. All the time, everywhere. 20 banal come-ons, but 1 that pushes and won't leave her alone, or angrily calls her a 'bitch' as she walks to her car in the middle of the night. That 1 becomes, over time, 2, 3, a dozen or more. The 20 becomes 100. This, in part, is what they are trying to tell us men.

The second context, is illustrated by your phrasing, ""yet some women still think of me as trash"". It's going to happen. You could be generally innocent, reflecting on your behavior, but someone will still think your trash. You've done nothing wrong, but you still get harassed. This is what women are telling us is happening to them all the time.

That's going to happen. They won't like you, so just give them space and leave them alone. It's often different though, because we are bigger and stronger than women, and generally our culture puts us in a place of more power.

I worry about my impact on the people around me, but I have to remind myself that this is all a dialog. When someone calls me 'racist', I'll ask them to explain. Get them talking so I can understand when they mean. I may not agree, but they may also be right. I may not be able to really hear them at the time, but I can reflect and change to be a stronger, better person tomorrow.

"I was fresh out of a relationship, she was a friend-of-a-friend who ""needed to get laid"", the mutual friend vouched for her (so it's kind of cheating on the spirit of the question since it was partially pre-arranged), but we hadn't known each other five minutes before she up and asked me ""so is what Kristen said about your ability to eat pussy true?""

"Probably a very... Isolated case. 

But men don't tend to really talk about personal issues. 

As a guy who doesn't really have a good family relationship it always feels like you're completely alone when it comes to mental issues.

"This is probably going to be taken wrongly.  But I would like to know what people considered ""sexual harassment"" before I took too much stock in it.  I once read a newspaper article where what the woman called sexual harassment basically came down to a guy who she wasn't attracted to hitting on her on the subway.  Basically he had an admittedly bad pickup line, and she wasn't interested.  By her own admission, after she rebuffed him, he didn't pursue her further. So if that is what some of these people are considering sexual harassment, then I think its ridiculous. 

Also, some women think any kind of flirting or asking out in the office, even if by a peer not a boss, is sexual harassment.  

So while I do think it is a huge deal, I also would need to know the actual specifics.  Like some women I know personally who wrote it, I fully believe it.  Others, I think its more an exaggeration.  Unwanted attention can be annoying, but I don't think its always sexual harassment either."

"Unfortunately, that's really not the case. Several years ago I was on the D.C. metro sitting by the window with headphones on and my arms draped around my bag on my lap. I was looking out the window and hadn't made eye contact with anyone. Still, a man sat down next to me and waved his hand in front of my face. I took out one earbud thinking that he needed directions, and he proceeded to introduce himself and give me compliments about my appearance. I told him I had a bf, but thanks, and put my earbud back in - very clearly indicating that I wasn't on the metro to talk to random strangers. He then further invaded my space, and lifted my hand with the intention of kissing it ""like a gentleman."" I had to yank my hand back and shove my way out of the seat in order to move to the other end of the car, after which he whined loudly ""oh I was just trying to be nice."" 

I understand that not all men are that aggressive - I even married one! - but I've been in so many situations where men have completely ignored my obvious indifference and reluctance. I'm 28 now, and I've experienced similar ""overly friendly"" behavior from men since I was 12. "
"When I (m) was 18 I worked in bar and ended up having regular sex with my 40 yr old boss (f). Now I’m almost 40 and I find myself attracted to women in their late 50s.

"Dating sucks.  I'm so tired of girls finding it acceptable to not even respond after a date.  Like, I'm fine if you don't want to go out again, but it doesn't mean you have to ignore my texts.

"When we're at the bar, women basically ignore him. We can both be talking to someone he knows and she'll be very engaged to what I'm saying; major eye contact and touching.

"Under a minute. She walked up and said ""I live around the corner"" then we walked around the corner to her apartment. After she said she has never done that before and always wanted to have sex with two guys in one day so, I introduced her to a friend. I realized when I saw them kissing that I forgot to tell him she had my dick in her mouth just a few minutes ago. "
"As a first-hand example.  My ex and I were always on great terms.  Due to being teenagers when she got pregnant, and asking for state medical for our daughter, child support was garnished directly from my wages. I had no problem paying it, but didn't have a choice anyway.. the state contacted my employer and took it out of my pay before it ever got to me.

Fast forward a couple of years and she's no longer getting any state aid.  My ex has a job that has great medical and my daughter is on her family plan which costs her next to nothing.  However, I get called into the HR department about a letter the state sent demanding that I provide insurance for my daughter.  I was single and moving to a family plan would have almost tripled my health insurance (keeping in mind, I'm still like 19 at the time).

We decide together to go to court to get it all straightened out, have the garnishment removed and just handle child support between us.. no government involvement at all.

We get to court and they pull her aside and have a short conference with her where they try to convince her not to do this.  She says it's what we all want, so we wait and finally go before the judge.

Judge does the same thing.  Says ""You do realize this will just make it harder when he stops paying and you come back here to reinstate this, right?""  Mind you, throughout this ENTIRE process, no official has said a word to me or asked for my input at all.

We did get the request granted and had no issues at all with child support, but the entire time, it was my ex working with the court while I stood there unable to contribute anything.. even though it was my paycheck, my insurance and my daughter they were discussing."
"Maybe I’m unique, but I find that *I’m* the one who sends those lengthy, somewhat emotional texts. Most girls I know keep their feelings to themselves. This works out great for casual, but when it’s more than that - it’s not okay.

"It’s a commonly replicated research finding.  Here is a summary from Brene Brown, a leading researcher in the psychology of vulnerability:

&amp;nbsp;

“Here’s the painful pattern that emerged from my research with men: We ask them to be vulnerable, we beg them to let us in, and we plead with them to tell us when they’re afraid, but the truth is that most women can’t stomach it. In those moments when real vulnerability happens in men, most of us recoil with fear and that fear manifests as everything from disappointment to disgust. And men are very smart. They know the risks, and they see the look in our eyes when we’re thinking, C’mon! Pull it together. Man up.” (Brown, 95)

&amp;nbsp;

Research in the social sciences finds the same pattern over and over.  Women report that they want to see men’s vulnerability and soft side, but when they do it consistently decreases their respect and attraction for the man.  Men who are victims of rape also lose their partners very close to 100% of the time.  No matter how progressive their stated philosophy, women lose respect and attraction for a man who cannot even protect himself, so obviously could not protect her.  Related to this phenomenon are the findings that couples with less traditional chore distribution also tend to have less sex.   Most women want a man to share equally in household chores, but seeing their man doing traditional “women’s work” actually makes them lose sexual attraction for him.  These findings are not about women trying to be deceptive or mistreat men.  It’s about a deeper and older layer of the psyche that often over-rides the paper-thin top layer of modern social conditioning.

"Well... seeing as your last post from 6 days ago was ""[As a guy, is it normal to fantasize about having sex with your attractive female friends?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/75vg9v/as_a_guy_is_it_normal_to_fantasize_about_having/)""... is it possible she has a point here?

If you're being flirtatious and specifically seeking friendships with women who are clearly attractive to you, it's not entirely fair to just call this baseless jealousy.

How are you meeting these friends? Do you make the same degree of effort in making male and female friends? Are you friendly with women who are not attractive to you? What do you do with your friends? Do you invite your girlfriend to participate in social activities with your friends? Does she mention any specific behaviour of yours that she doesn't like in relation to your friends (i.e. if you're touchy/huggy, get really drunk regularly, etc)?"
"Your first sentence says that he isn't exactly an attractive guy. So he may be right in feeling that he is not attractive. He may not be ugly but just average? I don't know. Being told you are average isn't exactly a compliment though. 

Getting angry about the compliments is a bit of an issue though. Sounds like he has some real confidence issues. There really isn't much you can do to change how he feels about his looks though. My only suggestion would be maybe try other compliments. Don't say he looks cute, say ""that shirt looks good on you"" or if he is doing some hobby he likes compliment how he is good at that. Overall if complimenting his face/body doesn't do anything for him, try complimenting other things you like about him. "

In that year, my father-in-law died, then my uncle dropped dead of a heart attack in his bathroom, then my first wife of 20 years died after a two year fight with cancer and left me the single parent to a fledgeling teenaged girl, then my mother died, and then a guy I'd known for like fifteen years died. There's no fair. If there were, all of that wouldn't have happened all at once.

So let's just ignore the fact that she calls me ""daddy"", and I'm here 4 days a week taking care of her(the other 3 are daycare). Some other parents would feel weird, and so they just exclude people..

"Setting up ""tests"" to see if your partner is responding to situations in a way SHE considers correct.

You can't tell from looking at the bowl which candies are poisoned and will kill you, so would you still be excited for the candy? I mean, not all candies are poisoned, right?

Except this is for the rest of our life. It's not candy, it's every man we try and have a relationship with or even simply encounter in day to day life. We don't know which ones are going to hurt us or kill us or follow us to our cars or where we live or anything else you can imagine, but we're expected to constantly espouse 'not all men' are like that when the simple truth is that *we know, we just have no clue which ones are*."

He showed that he was interested in checking in with me between dates and that made me more comfortable/interested in him"
Nothin low-key about it. 
75% of askmen wouldn't even register that you're flirting if you jerked them off to completion.
If he was on duty then it was a little bit inappropriate for him to ask for her number.
"What dating is becoming. 

I believe that tinder and other dating apps are killing the dating scene. Everything becomes about looks and who is best at taking photos and on top of that it makes people not want to commit because what if the next one you match with is better than the one you are texting with now? It's bad. 

What's worse is that girls look at me in an odd way when I approach them and politely ask them for their number, like I was an alien of sorts without a phone. "
"That suicide is never the answer. No, people have the right to die. It's their life, it's their choice. Sure it might make you sad, but why do we try so hard to force these people to stay alive when they could end it humanely? I understand that some people are happy they failed to commit suicide years later. But instead of leaving them to resort to drastic measures, let suicidal people speak with a treatment team about physician-assisted suicide openly. Make sure the option is always there, but conduct therapy. Make them go through a process. If they are still terminally suicidal, let them end it. "
"Perfect answer. Also, just wanted to add to the conversation. When you're at work and expected to be nice to customers...that is when things really get awkward. I've been told so many things like I have pretty eyes, as they get about 5 inches from my face, that I smell good, as they take a big deliberate whif. In one instance, an older man said he wanted to punch me in the face because he was so jealous of my beautiful hair. This really happened to me. I am not here for your viewing or creeping pleasure. I'm on the clock and being paid to be nice and helpful to you."
"I don't want to hear ""is it in yet"".."

"You seem really happy sharing this story, congrats to you man!"

"Was madly into this girl who broke it up with me before we had sex. 3 months later I see her for the first time, clubbing. We chat, we drink, she says all the things i want to hear. She pulls me home and I am all for it. As im lying on her bed with her ontop pf me...I realize she is absolutely sloshed. Like as drunk as you can be without actually being 'out'.  Given this woulf be the first time for me, I eas adamsnt it would go down this way. And i starigjt up told her, lets do it when youre in a better way. So we cuddle and go to sleep. 

Over the next few days she says she aint want ahit from me :( 

I definitely missed an amazing 'shot' but Id be in a worse way if I had, i know that....not to mention she was very very drunk. "
"I'm in college and I'm taking a human sexuality course. I just learned yesterday that generally throughout high school and college ages, girls go from being very concerned about their looks to less concerned, while guys go from less to more concerned with their own looks. Just food for thought I guess."

"I got really frustrated at all the posts on my Facebook feed saying ""women speak up about sexual assault/harassment"", and then even more angry when people shot me down for chiming in.

It isn't a God damn issue that only women face, it's an issue that only women report. There is a difference.

I am a less than attractive male, I'll be honest about it, but I have been raped. Plenty of guys get sexually assaulted or harassed, and everyone ignores or looks down upon guys that do.

When I admitted to  few friends about getting raped, about half told me that I couldn't be raped, because I had an erection... Like... Seriously?!

Those that did empathize with me, considered it not a big deal.

Another great example of this shit is when I watched a movie that had a couple rape scenes in it, one of which was a woman raping a man, the rest men raping women. When the women were getting raped, the group I watched it with were all cringing and disgusted. When the man? I was the only one disgusted... Why? The man was crying out for help and for her to stop. When he hit her is the only time there was outrage in that room about that scene. That is totally fucked up.


I'm so angry about all the shit I've been seeing in the last 6 months of downplaying sexual harassment that men face, but kick up  huge storm when women bitch. It's not a woman's problem, it's a people's problem. Damn it!"
"When I lost my virginity the girl started crying in the middle of the act.  She was not a virgin, so it wasn't out of pain. It was an emotional reaction and it was awful.

"How long have you been there?  I studied abroad and have lived abroad many times and there is a progression of culture shock that happens.

At first, everything maybe exciting as it can feel like vacation and everything is so new its exciting.  Then when it sinks in you'll be there awhile, it can begin to feel overwhelming - having no one familiar to help you navigate a foreign culture.  Feeling displaced and that you maybe missing out at home. 

For me personally, there is always a moment when this breaks and it all shifts - when you actually feel like there's a purpose as to why you are there and that you are seriously growing as an individual for taking the risk of displacing yourself in society and having to find your way.

It's always happened in a flash - maybe I have a great night out with new friends and feel a part of their lives.  Or I finally understand the language and can navigate around on my own and don't feel like a tourist anymore.  

All I can say is it's fucking hard to be an adventurer, but these are seriously the times in life that you grow the most.  Enjoy it as soon you'll be home and back in your routine, and won't have the opportunity to push yourself like this on the everyday."
"Dude I understand the schedule. I'm working full time and weekends while going to grad school full time. My friends all have M-F jobs, make significantly more than me, and don't go to school.

I just don't care about living my dream or any of that bullshit. I just want money to do things and have time to do them."

Study after study shows that people who exhibit ""dark triad"" traits tend to find themselves at the top of the societal hierarchy. This guy was clearly manipulative and narcissistic. He's one of probably many guys just like him at the upper levels of Hollywood. "
"It has to do with the idea of freedom.  It's like this: when I turn down a woman for a date/flirting, she usually gives a positive reaction despite any hurt feelings. It's usually full of kindness, and often we become friends with no further flirting. When I turn down a man he starts trying to convince me why I'm wrong to turn him down. He wants an explanation. He wants to know when in the future I'll be available. Seldom do we become friends. Where a woman usually reacts to the disappointment with kindness, men react with defensiveness. 9 out of 10 guys walk away after this, but it's The One who doesn't. I have been cornered in a bathroom unable to leave, I have been followed all over town, I have been repeatedly asked out by the same person who then asks my coworkers to ask me for him because I keep saying no, I have been yelled and cursed at, I have been accused of lying/cheating/using people, I have had a man loudly explain sex positions to me on the train, and so on. And I am not a woman who gets asked out a *lot*, maybe 3-4 times in a year? So now we get to the freedom. Sometimes I want no one to bother me (at the gym for example) and I don't want to take care of anyone else's feelings. I'm doing my thing (going through the airport for example), give my polite ""I don't want to be a problem, so send me on my way smile"" and I get asked for my number by someone who could cause me to miss my flight and I have to start wondering *is he one of the 9, or is he The One*, I  feel like I have no freedom now to walk through the airport. 

It sounds like you're trying to be one of the 9, and that's good (please, please stay that way!). But until I see you be rejected, I have no way of knowing which one you'll be. Men aren't ""the enemy"", men are a potentially dangerous unknown until proven otherwise. For women, life is like playing a constant game of ""Murderer in the dark"". You're *probably* not going to hurt me, and I know that, but I also *know* there is a murderer out there, and until I have proof I don't know that it's not you. And all women have a naive friend who has been raped and/or abused because she was too trusting. 

What can you do? Be kind and safe. Be reasonable and non-defensive when you get a ""no"". Stop telling yourself women see you as ""the enemy"" but rather as an ""unknown potential hazard"". You'll prove to healthy women pretty quickly you're not ""trash"". We're only trying to stay alive and safe, show us we can be with you. 

And yes there are women who do think of all men as ""the enemy"", but you're not responsible for their thoughts. You aren't obligated to win every woman on planet earth over. These women have either experienced or directly observed some horrors perpetuated by men on women, and they are reacting to that. The men in their lives proved to be Very Dangerous, and they have determined it is much safer to assume that of all men. You can't change that. They'll need professional help. The best thing you can do for these women is be kind and good to the other women in your life. The ""all men are the enemy"" women only have female friends, and they need to see those female friends be treated well by their male friends/lovers. Even then, you're not responsible for their thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes and you'll make yourself crazy if you try to be. "

"One time while visiting family, I fell off my cousin's longboard and sprained my wrist *bad* - like I thought it was broken and got x rays as soon as I could.

"As a large male it's also exhausting at times being in public. Fortunately my problems are not so great as yours but they still exist. At 6'2 260lbs I can be a bit intimidating to those around me. How do I put women around me at ease? I usually try for a quick smile with minimal eye contact, maybe a quick hello. It does hurt sometimes seeing instinctive fear from a friendly hello. I remain empathetic though. I cannot imagine what it must feel to be powerless, and to stand next to someone who makes you feel weak and wonder what is going on in their head must be terrifying.

Recently while at a light I noticed a young lady who's back tire needed air badly. I exited my car in broad daylight with dozens of other cars around and ran to her window. She was scared out of her mind, and I felt bad for even trying to stop and help after. Not because I did anything wrong, but because I legitimately scared the daylights out of her for existing. There are all kinds of examples really. I was at the hardware store and offered to help lift a heavy object a woman was struggling with in the parking lot. Not a great response either there.

Hell I know it's a dangerous world out there for women, really I do. I know my feelings are totally secondary to their safety. Still though... Would a little kindness really kill people? Probably, I'm not a woman so I wouldn't really know.



PS.
Oh and to those who are going to accuse me of being some sort of neck beard or whatever, tinder exists for a great reason. If you're over 6 foot that's all you really need to get responses. I don't hit on girls in public because there's a place online to do so."

"I may be an idiot but the distinction between a bus, a grocery store, and a workout class are not clear to me. I think the issue here is that everyone has a different set of preferences for when they want to be approached and when they want to approach. You've been dealing with guys whose own preferences are impeding on your preferences. We can change this by better publicizing preferences, like you're doing now, but the reality is there is no standard set. The reality also is that for now, society still sees the man as the instigator of contact, though that's changing (a little). So I don't think it's really effective to preach a particular set of locations as open or closed, I think it's better to abstract those examples into principles, like the following:

* If I appear to be busy, now is not a good time to talk.

* If I don't continue the conversation, I am not interested.

These are location-agnostic, nuanced principles where the logic behind them is self-evident. "

"I took her to a restaurant that neither of us had ever been to before, and which served cuisine neither of us had tried. Russian. Turned out to be a good idea. I called the restaurant and told them my plan. They got really excited because, according to them, they'd never had a proposal before. So we ate, completely enjoyed the food. All during dinner, I kept catching the waiters, the cook, the hostess, peeking through the windows like ""did he ask her yet?"" So when I felt like I had them on the hook for long enough, I nodded to them, then got down on one knee, pulled the ring out of my pocket, and asked. All the air went out of the room for like half a second while everyone held their breath and waited for her answer. She said yes. All the waiters, cooks, and the hostess cheered then ran out and congratulated us, gave us free champaign, and the tastiest cake I've ever had, decorated by hand with chocolate  that read ""CONGRATULATIONS!"" Then they took our picture and put it on their Facebook page. That place is now our favorite restaurant to eat at. And I don't regret asking her one bit. We've been married just shy of two years now, and it keeps getting better. "

Asking somebody out isn't harassment. Not noticing (or correctly interpreting) signals isn't harassment. The person being approached has every right to be tired or annoyed or uninterested. The person approaching, however, isn't harassing them."

"&gt;A toothpaste factory had a problem. They sometimes shipped empty toothpaste boxes without the tube inside. This challenged their perceived quality with the buyers and distributors. Understanding how important the relationship with them was, the CEO of the company assembled his top people. They decided to hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem. The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP, and third-parties selected. Six months (and $8 million) later they had a fantastic solution – on time, on budget, and high quality. Everyone in the project was pleased.

&gt;They solved the problem by using a high-tech precision scale that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box weighed less than it should. The line would stop, someone would walk over, remove the defective box, and then press another button to re-start the line. As a result of the new package monitoring process, no empty boxes were being shipped out of the factory.

 &gt;With no more customer complaints, the CEO felt the $8 million was well spent. He then reviewed the line statistics report and discovered the number of empty boxes picked up by the scale in the first week was consistent with projections, however, the next three weeks were zero! The estimated rate should have been at least a dozen boxes a day. He had the engineers check the equipment; they verified the report as accurate.

&gt;Puzzled, the CEO traveled down to the factory, viewed the part of the line where the precision scale was installed, and observed just ahead of the new $8 million dollar solution sat a $20 desk fan blowing the empty boxes off the belt and into a bin. He asked the line supervisor what that was about.

&gt;“Oh, that,” the supervisor replied, “Bert, the kid from maintenance, put it there because he was tired of walking over to restart the line every time the bell rang.”"
"I've had two lovers attempt the jealousy-as-a-manipulation-tool thingy with me.  They both ended up disappointed.  I told them that if they were going to go play that game, fine, just go do whatever they want with whoever they want and I won't interfere, but I also won't be there to take them back when they are done with it.  After having experienced a few dramatic relationships which sucked the life out of me, I don't have the mental energy to deal with someone who likes to play head games with romance like they are in high school or something.

"I knew a college girl (back when I was in college) and she was a virgin.  I don’t remember how the conversation started, but a group of us were having drinks and the  topic turned to sex.  The virgin girl was asking a lot about penises and posed an interesting question. She asked if penises had bones in them. 

We all giggled a little bit, and I responded with “that’s why they call them boners”. 
It seemed as if a light was turned on and she finally understood. 

After a few minutes I broke the news to her that there are no bones in a male penis, and it’s more like a sock that holds blood.  She seemed even more confused.

* When I'm alone with children, like my nieces and nephews, I'm frequently treated (mostly by women) like a predator.
* I'm not allowed to voice my opinion on gender issues.
* Women at my workplace have sexually harassed me and spoken derogatorily about men, with no repercussions for them.
* I have been sexually assaulted by a woman. Typically I am told that it was ""no big deal"" because ""men are larger and stronger"" and that I should focus my energy on caring about when women are assaulted instead.
* Every day, through feminist media, I get to hear about what a garbage human being I am, simply because I was born straight, white, and male. I'm frequently asked to ""check my privilege,"" despite having a fairly difficult life, in which I had to work hard to achieve what I have.

I arrive and make contact. She's heavily intoxicated but says she is ok. I escort her to her hotel (NOT her hotel room) and during the walk, she asks a few times if Im married. I say yes.....and even said once ""happily married"". This is where I start to record..........

Outside her hotel, she asks me to come up. I say no. She specifically said these following phrases................EVERYTHING IS RECORDED

""You take those marriage vows sacred???"" 
"" &lt;friends name&gt; Loves me....but I don't love him""

"Third date she comes over to my place. We had dinner and were making out and talking when it turned out she was dating with the intention of getting into a relationship. I assumed otherwise because Tinder.

I wasn't really looking for one then and she was visibly deflated so we got to talking about different things: my views on sex and relationships and our experiences with dating. Very weird, but she started giving me pecks once in a while, got very handsy and sort of hinted she wanted us together on the bed.

I pretended to be oblivious and spent the night on the couch. I generally prefer only to be intimate when we're both on the same page as far as what we're looking for. She took it well, but I still don't know if what I did was really shitty or not.

The only other time I've turned down sex was with someone who acted like I was the lucky one getting to have sex with her, not two horny people (hopefully) attracted to each other. Nope. The look of shock on her face was worth it."

"Greek virtue is a formal aspect of a philosphy known as Virtue Ethics. The idea is that the best things a person can be lie in the middle of a vice of excess (having too much of a certain quality) and a vice of deficiency ( severely lacking in a quality). For example, if could be argued that he virtue of courage lies in the middle path between foolhardiness (excess) and cowardice (deficiency).

The aim in Greek societies (that listened to Plato and he like - not everyone like him and The Academy) was to learn how to gain access to as many of these virtues as possible within their life span, and just be honest possible example of humanity you could be by the time you died.

Best thing about this system is that is promotes really healthy masculinity, rather than the fragile masculinity that leads to male suicide rates being so much higher than female. As well as bravery and physical beauty being aspired to by the Greeks, they also put HUGE emphasis on healthy friendships (as in the Platonic Relationships people refer to sometimes), peer counselling, a healthy sex and romantic life, and the expression of emotion as a cardinal right of all people on their quest for virtue. 

Greeks had some good shit in their society if you ignore the massive amounts of slavery, misogyny and racism 😂"

"I'll bite for the controversial angle. Before I get burnt at the stake or have my words quoted out of context, I'd like to explicitly iterate that harassment of any kind is wrong, and rape is obviously deplorable. As a society we can definitely do better than we are, and anyone who acts like an assclown should be called out.

My facebook feed is full of #MeToo stories. Several of them depict instances along the lines of, ""A man I didn't like made unwanted advances and I felt unsafe"". Several of them are also from friends of mine whom I know for a fact were victims of truly traumatic sexual assault. I can only assume that there is a wide range of experiences being reported, ranging from ""I was forcibly penetrated at knifepoint"" to ""A group of construction workers whistled at me"".

Again, obviously all instances of sexual harassment and assault are wrong and the world ought to be a better place, but there is a HUGE distinction in severity across the spectrum of what is considered ""Sexual assault"" and especially ""Sexual Harassment"" in modern nomenclature. It would be like lumping in some guy at a bar drunkenly calling you a little bitch and saying he could kick your ass, vs. having a gang of masked men break into your house and beating you within an inch of your life with baseball bats. It would be like if to raise awareness for the sorry state of our healthcare system, we lumped together people who have peanut allergies with those that have brain cancer.

I recognize the goal of the movement is to illustrate how many women are negatively impacted by shitty culture, but the perceived effect in my mind (and at least several of my friends who are wisely staying silent) is that victims of relatively minor incidents are massively diluting the significance of those who have experienced major, serious trauma. And it is having the opposite of the intended effect on me, by making me skeptical of various claims about statistics since I know that a huge range of experiences are all being lumped into a single label. Yet, we are expected to treat everyone with equal concern and empathy as the most serious possible scenarios. I'm sorry, but I don't have the unlimited bandwidth available required to give the empathy that a ""raped at knifepoint"" victim deserves to every single person reporting a [broadly defined] sexual assault experience.

If the goal is to highlight that a huge number of women are mistreated, then message received. However, I have to admit that my gut reaction is, ""most of these scenarios, while shitty, are relatively harmless and life is tough"". It doesn't stop me from still striving to treat everyone with dignity and respect, but it does make me wonder how full of shit the next person who claims sexual assault is, and I hate that it might cause me to overlook someone who was really, truly hurt because thousands of people wanted to cry wolf."
"And the word is being actively killed like curvy was. You aren't thicc, you're shaped like a rectangle. "
Legit haven't heard anyone use that since 2001 brotato.
"""It shrinks?"""
I think OP is more talking about setting up the first date. Just to show your interested.
IT'S IN THE FREEZER ON THE LEFT SIDE!
Every time I see a lit cigarette butt come flying out of a car window a die a little inside.
"He's gay, which makes it uncomfortable too. But I'm trying to not make it about that. I'd be uncomfortable if he wasn't gay, too."
"The man who sold the world - david bowie. 

Hurt - johnny cash "
"Gal here: I'm seeing a lot of ""grooming"" and ""cleaning"" advice here, which out to be given if you know you're going to have sex. The most important part is the set up to sex; be flirty, give her compliments, make innuendos without getting handsy, brush her cheek or stroke her hair.... and you will be set up to make the night happen. Being well groomed and cleaned is an obvious. Do that, but focus on the segue to the end you're reaching for."
"The other thing that makes it inappropriate is the power differential - TSA can seriously inconvenience you if you piss them off. 

Not saying there aren't *much* worse things out there but if that happened to be I'd be peeved too. "
"ask if he needs a hand?

seriously though, this is awkward true, but not actually if it happened to me I would call him out tell him i dont want to hear it and to take it to the shower. 

Bonus points to you if you make sure you're out at least once or twice a week so he can have a guilt free fap with all the weird sound effects he wants. 

we all do it, no judgement but dude tell him to keep it to himself  because thats just what people do."
"Saudi Arabia because I'm suggesting that he understand that women have to deal with this shit all the time. Niiiiiiice.

Seriously, I'm not saying anywhere not to talk to people, but try to have empathy that the interaction that people have don't happen in isolated bubbles. Your the one jumping to the idea of mandated behavior. 

And causal conversations with strangers, often turn to sexual advances, and it isn't easy to tell when/if it will change. So your suggestion that we are incapable to discerning that is a bit strange. Sometimes it is clear, often it is not. It isn't about social anxiety, and it isn't about not being strong it is about seeing that their is a human life beyond what one person is bringing to the situation. Women are always told that they need to give the guys the befit of the doubt because he might be the 1/5 asking for directions. Guys should give us the benefit of the doubt we might have just dealt with 4 that weren't and it isn't personal. "

"Don't be an asshole, cum in her asshole"
"&gt;I'd have a fucking field day if a girl asked me out...literally any girl.

Is it just me or does a woman sometimes seem hotter just for having expressed interest in you? One one or two occasions, a woman who I've never really noticed or thought much of has done this and I've immediately noticed things about her which suddenly I find myself most interest in."
"I can relate. I have a pretty good relationship with my family, but any attempt to talk about my feelings or issues with them doesn't go over very well. When you grow up learning that nobody cares about your problems, you don't have a choice but to deal with them yourself."
"Well, you could always say you're being sexually harassed. It goes both ways.
"
File a title 9 sexual assault complaint next time. 
"I felt bad for her. She's got kids, and couldn't do much with them because she couldn't be active for too long without being in a lot of pain. 

Now she can chase them around the house, pick them up, and generally just be a mom. Completely changed her life. "
"Former scoutmaster.... Because when scouts was created, boys and girls had very different life paths.  Still there are things covered in Girl Scouts that are not covered in Boy Scouts, and vice versa.  The rules on safe camping are crazy strict since a few pedos were able to find their way into leadership so as to have access to victims while hiding behind the mantle of of a safe adult leader for children who might not have that influence in their life in their own homes.  The same freaks use being a priest, pastor, coach for the same purposes and make all our lives more dark and difficult.  Those safe camping rules will become even more of a logistical issue now. 

While Boy Scouts doesn't specifically go into any sort of sex education, it does address issues of safety and when to cry foul.  I assume that will be more of an issue now.  

And there's the boy/girl issue.  Scouts runs till age 18 and beyond depending on the program.  That's a lot of constant supervision I personally don't want to be in charge of with unpaid volunteer adults.  I think both organizations will probably be lessened by the changes.  Glad it's not my problem anymore.  "
Lesson learned: Don't date anyone who sucks your dick after only 15 minutes of meeting.
"Eh the dating apps thing is a toss up. Women don't really want the tons of unsolicited dick pics and harassment they get with the extra attention. 

Mental health shows a very real disparity though. "
"It’s hard to accept ghosting, but sometimes it’s a way of life. "
Still probably closer to harassment than assault. 
Explains why he only recorded for 6 seconds. 
Now kiss.
"I never got to do so.  

We were in a LDR and had been talking about moving together in the fall and I'd been dropping hints that I'd propose to her during the summer. I already had some initial plans just how I'd do it.  

Here in Finland there's an old tradition that during leap day women can propose as well and if the man says no he has to buy the woman enough fabric for a skirt.  

Well, that particular year happened to be a leap year. Leap day came and we both happened to be in the same location, she proposed and I wasn't going to say no just so I'd get to fulfill my own plans.  

Married for twelve years now."
Exactly. Unfortunately I got that reply today. Thought we were okay. Turns out you can never be sure. 🤷🏻‍♀️
"The most popular You Tube people are always the most uneducated, backward and unsophisticated.  "
"Your sleazy friend is exposing his girlfriend to potential STDs from his side piece, not to mention he's stringing the girlfriend along at a time when she's seriously thinking of marriage and kids. The fact that this is fine with your friend circle seems to indicate that it's a group of dickish sleaze-enablers. 

If you want to do the right thing, you tell her (try anonymously if you can't have the difficult in-person conversation). Afterwards take a long, hard look at your friend group and ask yourself if these are the men you really want to consider friends."
TITTY BAR!
