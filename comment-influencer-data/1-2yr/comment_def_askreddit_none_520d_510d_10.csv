"Man this is me. I was at a festival when this group of kids (I was 28 then this guy and his fiends were probably 22?) move in front of us and start dancing.  It’s clear from how they’re Moving they are fucked up on heavy stuff, def psychedelics and ? But whatever it was was causing them all to dance really out of rhythm and strange. 
All of a sudden one of the group, a guy, doubles over and does the junkie lean where you should be tipped over but you aren’t.  He starts to slowly and then more rapidly bounce his head around until his whole body is moving and he just falls over on his back and goes rigid with his hands at his sides. He starts to have a full on seizure, he’s biting his tongue super hard and his face is bright red turning to purple and blue. 
His friends scatter into the wind and I immediately tell one friend to get help and another to help hold him onto his side. I straddled his arms so he could flail and then held his head and used my wallet to take some pressure off his tongue. As soon as I do blood starts to pour out and after a good two minutes of this and me yelling “where the fuck are the medics!?” The kid just stops. He gets up and brushes the grass off super dazed and tries to walk away and I till him he’s not going anywhere he needs to stand or sit but stay wit me. He tries to get take off and his friends are yelling at him to quickly join him but this guy is NOT good. One pupil is huge one is small he’s slurring words...he looks like he had a stroke. 
That’s when the EMTs Finally came
And took over. His friends had the balls to call me an asshole because he was high and “now he was gonna get in trouble”. I just told them to fuck off and learn how to party responsibly and learn how NOT to leave your friend for dead next time. Sucks if he got on trouble but he needed help worse than I’ve seen in a while. And the nerve of his “friends” too. "
"Yeah I def think it's about how it's done! I told my brother once how I hated seeing when a guy keeps his hand on his lady's back/neck when walking places because it looks so controlling. He said, ""Oh, shit. Well I do this but it's because if we're walking through a crowd I want her to know I'm there and she's not by herself."" Made me slightly less put off by these kinds of things!"
"The real reason is that, unless it’s an elaborate Mission Impossible sequence, we as an audience *hate* being told what’s about to happen. It’s more fun finding out what’s happening as a character does.

It’s def a trope, but the opposite version of this is usually just really, really bad expositional writing that ruins the following action. Lose/lose."
"From SW Virginia, can confirm was about 15 feet from a mountain lion in the wild about 10 years ago. Def not a bobcat."
