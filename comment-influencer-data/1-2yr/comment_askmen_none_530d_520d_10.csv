"""You look really handsome today"" seems like you're hitting on them (that's how I would take it, anyway) which can be confusing depending on your relationship with them. Something like ""I like that shirt"" or ""Looking good!"" is probably a better way to phrase it. Honestly, just saying ""nice!"" is sufficient in a lot of cases."

"So during College this last April I was heading home from the school gym. I had just gone through a break up the last November and was taking some time to just focus on myself and get over it. Sort of etched that mantra in my head of ""Get hotter, get smarter"". The bus stop near the school gym shares pathways to the exam center and a few other buildings - so those waiting at this stop are not only gym-goers. 






I walked to the bus stop and shuffled through my post-breakup songs. Drake, Ed Sheeran, Adele - I think I settled on something from The Killers. As the bus came reeling foward I stepped aside so I could let the the other two girls on the bus first, even though the bus stopped at my feet. 


I looked up, nodded at the first girl. She smiled back, *""Thanks""*


Then, after her. It was what would be undeniably the most beautiful girl I had ever seen in my 5 years at this university. 


*""Thanks""* , she chirped as she happily walked onto the bus. 


I stood there for a good 3 seconds. Who. Was. That. 


I got on the bus too, and sat 3 seats down from her. But on the other side so I could stare at her like a full on creep. I'm not lying, my heart was racing. My hands were beginning to sweat. Full fight or flight mode. I had never in my life gone up to a girl to talk to her, mostly because I never really wanted to. Majority of my relationships came from girls showing an interest first. But here we are, on this bus and I'm already planning our wedding. 


So, I did what any guy would do. I texted my friend.


*""Bro, where do I find the balls to talk to a girl?""*, I texted quickly. He didn't respond. 


I sat there, firmed that as soon as she got off I was going to get off too and talk to her. I didn't know what I was going to say, but I was NOT going to let something like this get away. I began mentally preparing myself. Then, she grabbed the hand rail and brought herself to her feet.


*... Fuck.*


She walked toward the bus door and waited.


*...Fuck.*


I prepared myself, and got up.


*....Fuck fuckity fucking fuck.*


The bus stopped, a trail of students drained out - she followed. I began walking toward the door. aaaaand quickly sat down at another seat. Classic StudintheCeiling. So, in shame - I text my friend. 


*""BRO I CHOCKED.*

*So I'm on the bus home, this girl comes on. About your skin tone. Bro i've been at this place for 5 years. She has to be the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. 10/10 face. I was going to get off at her stop and talk to her but i chocked. FUCK.""*


As soon as the bus door closed and I watched her fade away as the bus turned the corner. I quickly pulled the stop lever and waited to get off the next stop which was just a couple blocks away. I was going to talk to her. 


So, I get off and run to the direction of the previous stop. As I get there I look around, TRYING to find her. Nothing. She's gone. The one girl who I felt something more with. Something intangible. Something I had never felt before and I let it go because I lost my courage. That walk home was dreadful. 


Summer rolls by and I tried finding her everywhere. Instagram. Facebook. Twitter. Everything. I couldn't stop thinking about this girl. As summer love comes through work or other youthful pursuits I turned them all down. Mostly because I didn't want to distract myself during my process of healing but also because of this girl. This girl who didn't know I existed, and here I was turning away potential love for imaginative love. So, that's how summer went. 


Back in school and I decided I wanted nothing to do with girls. I wasn't going to pay attention to any girls, just focus on attempting to convert my face into Ryan Goslings, and get into medical school. 


So third week of school hits and I finally have lab for one of my classes. I'm late. It wasn't my fault, it's just that pizza &gt; medical school. So I walk in, interrupting the TA's introduction speech. I excuse myself, and rear my head to the first table to find a space to sit. 




Seat Taken. Seat Taken. Seat Taken. Seat Taken. *Her.*




I kid you not. There she was. Sitting there. With her sharp jawline, permanently sun-kissed skin, ninja-done eyebrows, thick red hair done up in a bun, eyes like a color no ocean could ever be. She looked up at me, smiled, then looked back down. 


I still think to this day my heart is trying to recover from skipping that beat. 


I sat down to the free seat, one down from her. And did the only reasonable thing. I texted my friend.





*""BRO. BRO. BROOOO*

*REMEMBER THE CUTE GIRL I SAW ON THE BUS LAST YEAR?*
*SHE'S IN MY FUCKING LAB""*


This time, he replied.



*""That's wifey. Wife her up right now"".*






So, I was going to talk to her after lab. I had to. God was giving me a second chance. I didn't know what I was going to say but I needed to talk to her. She left before me. *Faaan-fucking-tastic.* 



A few weeks went by, I would see her in class but she would always leave early. I think she may have caught me staring at her a few times. I hope she didn't catch the drool. So finally I decided, I would take her route to the bus and try and talk to her. 



As class ended, she blitzed up the stairs and out the door. I hurried behind her. But here's the shitstick. She had her headphones in. *So now what am I supposed to do? Take them out? Mime to her?* She's walking a few steps ahead of me with her earbuds in and phone in hand. And I'm trailing behind her trying to figure out how I'm going to talk to a girl for the very first time. 





Then, out of no where - as if God was tired of me being a giant pussy. Her phone slips out of her hand and her headphones come out. As she stumbles to get everything in hand - i begin to stutter over words that haven't even left my mouth. 





**Why are you such a fucking loser StudintheCeiling?**






But, something manages to weasel out. *""That was close""*, I said smiling. 

She looks up at my uglyass-noodlehead face, *""Yeah, haha. It was, I almost lost my life""*

*""Ahhh, don't worry. We're crossing the bridge, I'll end your misery and shove you over""*

She laughs, *""Haha, but seriously though"".*

I extend my hand out, *""I'm StudintheCeiling, by the way. You're in my lab for this class""*

*""Yeah, I know! I'm too-good-looking-for-you-but-I'll-talk-to-you-anyway""*

So, as we headed for the bus we talk. About classes. Where she's from. Where I'm from. We share some laughs. Her stop comes by, she looks at me, smiles *""See ya tomorrow!""*

I text my friend. 

*""Bro, I talked to her""*

*""Did you get her number?""*

*""No, I just talked to her like a normal person""*

*""You pussy""*

Next day we sat next to each other in class. I compliment her ring. She smiles. We talk towards the bus, sharing more about each other. We part ways, she smiles again. She gets on the bus, I head to the gym. I text my friend.

*""I love her.""*

*""Did you smash""*

*""What? No you degenerate""*

*""Digits?""*

*""Nah dude, I want to talk to her. Get to know her. This isn't some notch on a belt""*

*""You fucking pussy""*

I laugh. You see my friend is of the nature of sleeping with everyone and anyone. He's slept with more girls than I have seen, so it's fitting that he didn't like my approach. Then my phone vibrates. Twice. What does he want now? 

**Instagram**

*too-good-looking-for-you-but-I'll-talk-to-you-anyway* is now following you.

**Facebook**

*too-good-looking-for-you-but-I'll-talk-to-you-anyway* wants to be friends.

With no shame in the world, I fucking skipped like a girl to the gym that day. Cut a few days and we are on our first date to sushi. Cut a couple weeks and she comes over. She sits on my couch while I'm preparing dinner. I sit next to her and she nestles into me. My heart is melting. She looks up at me, asking for a kiss with her eyes. I just stare at the TV. A few minutes pass, and i kiss her on top of her head. She smiles, and looks at me again. Man did you know Animal Planet is so riveting? I can't take my eyes off the screen to kiss the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. So interesting. 

Eventually it gets late. I kneel off the couch and turn toward her. Smiling. She's smiling back. Time has stopped. Nothing else matters. I run a finger to place a piece of stray hair behind her ear even though she already looked flawless. I just stare at her intoxicating big Angelina Jolie-lips. I put one hand on her right cheek, the other on the left. I go in 90%, she goes in 10%. 

It was the best kiss of my life. 

As though it seemed we wouldn't, our lips parted. She smiled, and opened her eyes. I smiled. She already knew at this point that I had seen her on the bus before summer. She also saw the texts with my friend.

I look at her, *""You know, I waited 4 months for that kiss"".*

She smiles even wider. I go in for another kiss.


This time - I go in 100%.

Now, 6 months later. Here I am, face-timing her while she's sleeping. And she is everything.


 I just got a text from her today not too long ago.

*""Hunny,*

*I just really want you to know how much I appreciate you and how much you make me feel like I matter. It's all I've ever wanted. I was in a dark place before I met you, and I haven't been this happy in so long.*

*I just wanted to thank you for actually making a move on that bridge and becoming part of my life.""*

"When our daughter was still an infant, my wife would sometimes take the baby away from me to comfort her when she was crying. It made me feel like a shitty father. Why wasn't I good enough to comfort our child?  It's was an instinctual reaction of course. My wife meant nothing by it. But I had to make her realize what she was doing and how it made me feel."
Holy crap. Homegirl just showed up for the popcorn. 
"Exchanged pictures, she seemed pretty cute and was very engaging in the conversation. She didn't want to do anything other than a movie, so i agreed.

Waiting in the theater lobby with the movie tickets, a woman walks up to me and says hi sheepishly. I dont recognize her but i say hi back. She follows with ""What? am i not what you expected?"",
""No, you look a little different from your pictures?"", i replied.

""oh, i used my roomates pictures because i wanted to make sure i wasnt going on a date with someone shallow""

Im a little taken aback and question her a little bit more, she wasnt a huge girl but she was a little larger than average, but i was sure to be polite and make no mention of it.

At her request i got popcorn and pop for both of us.

When we sat down in the theater it got a little awkward, i wasn't really sure what to say anymore as the pictures she used had her doing things i typically enjoy, skiing, hockey, fishing. She stays silent as well, anything i asked was a one word answer.

She gets up right as the movie is starting and says she has to go to the washroom, but grabs her jacket and purse (and our popcorn)

About halfway through the movie it was pretty clear she wasn't coming back. The couple behind me consoled me and congratulated me on a ""dodged bullet""

"Went on a first date with a girl I loosely knew. She came to my place to meet and then we planned to go to dinner from there. She arrives and says she needs to use the bathroom. I offer the bathroom off my bedroom. It’s taking a while so I go check on her and she’s laying in my bed under the covers! Ask if she’s okay, she says yes and would like to just snuggle a bit. So I get in bed with her in my clothes and find she’s buck ass naked.  
I think that qualifies as a fuck girl.

"Not an SO, but I recently started going out with a girl via dating app. Lots of people on on these apps will identify as ""nerdy"", and as a nerdy person myself I usually take this with a grain of salt.

Cue to our first date. She's absolutely gorgeous and spectacularly cool, so I had to ask her, ""So... are you actually a nerd?""

She then reaches into her purse and pulls out a 20-sided die and her D&amp;D character sheet. I underestimated... severely. "

"I mean, my first ever online date was with a woman who was at least 20 (probably 30) years older than she said (and than her pictures showed).  She was also seriously out of shape, despite claiming to do a bunch of fun active hobbies... turned out those were all things she wished she'd done when she was younger, but hadn't.  Instead she'd worked at the DMV for ages.  She looked like a more out of shape version of my mother.

I, of course, hadn't lied at all, so I was a 24 year old guy who was in to active hobbies... we obviously wouldn't fit in the slightest.  But I still talked to her for a few hours and we went our separate ways.  I figure, she must have just been really lonely, so I gave her a nice enough night of talking and headed home.  Still got ice cream too so that's good."

Day of, I text her to make sure we are still on, she tries backing out. ""You won't like how I look"". Fuck. I say I've already seen her profile photos, and I tell her even if it doesn't work out we'll still have a good time on a date, which is better than spending the night alone.

"Late to the party here. But a great story follows.

Me 22 and horny as fuck. New city after undergrad, struggling to meet women my age.  Meet cute 21 year old girl on Yik Yak (RIP) on the campus near me,  and we exchange snap chats. Start casually talking and turns our shes cool AF and we have a lot in common. Many nights sending body/dick pics for her pussy/ boob pics. Nice body and chest. Looks tight and I'm loving it.

We start sending videos, her moaning and finger herself. Me busting a few nuts on the mirror. Were both loving it. I ask her for a drink after a few weeks.

Now heres me sitting at a bar anxious with a beer. Shes messages me.    Well turns out Steph or she called her self is actually Steve or Scott. Thats right a gay guy. He's actually 19 not 21 and ""liked what he saw"". Profusely apologizing about not coming clean earlier. Turned out we actually got  along well.  It was a double team cat fish with one the girls on his floor. Hindsight thats fucked up of her.  

He still wants to meet, I bail and block forever. But turns out he works at the same hospital, in the same building as me. BUT I never find out what he looks like. So 3-4x a week here I am transferring patients, etc and every time I see a potentially gay guy I wonder, is this Steve?  Thinking to myself, some barely legal gay guy has screen shots of my erect penis with mirror selfies and has seen and heard me bust a load.

"I am going to a divorce support group at my local church, it's like 8 to 10 women, and 3 to 4 men. As we introduced ourselves, one of the women said she was surprised that there were any men in the group...she didn't think men were affected emotionally by divorce. The next man introduced himself as a divorced man who hadn't been allowed to see his daughters for that last 8 months. 

Edit 2: I want to repeat something - since I have seen some nasty comments - the women at this group were not really being MEAN or MALICIOUS to the men - they are all very devastated/shell-shocked about their divorces all in a lot of grief, but -they seriously - to a person - did not understand why any man would be at an ""emotional support group"" for divorce. One woman said it aloud - and the rest of the women nodded and said ""yeah"" in agreement to her statement. I was not angry or ""hurt"" by what she said - just really confused by the sentiment - considering that this is a military town with lots of returning soldiers who are suffering from PTSD - and those guys are known to support groups to deal with their trauma - it's not a secret. "
"It happened to me once, a long time ago when IMs were the way to communicate. A girl from my city got me chatting, she suggested we should meet and described time, place and what she will be wearing.

Not only was she MUCH bigger than expected, she was with some even bigger friend (and note that's early '00 Poland, we escaped murderous ideology of communism like 15 years before, so fat people were not common). When I recognized it was her and there were no other girls around matching the description I just went away. And yes, she recognized me, because I also described myself. No, she never caught up with me, she couldn't run."

"When we fight, and I feel like I'm going to say or do something I'll regret, I tend to just walk away and sit in another room for a while until I cool down.

She will get on her phone and call her friend and LOUDLY complain to her about me and how wrong I am and how I'm being an asshole for no reason. And she'll usually start cleaning or picking up after me to dramatically show what a lazy piece of shit I am because I'm just sitting there.

"So here's one from last autumn. I acknowledge that it's possible that she just didn't feel a spark when we finally went out, but even so, that would only justify a few of these problems.

She said she was ""witty, outgoing"" -- she couldn't hold a conversation at all

""Paralegal"" -- secretary at a law office, no legal work involved

""Full of life"" -- true in the literal sense that she was currently pregnant (!)

Wanted to meet at a wine bar of her choosing -- see above. She didn't drink, but she also couldn't eat anything there because she was a level five vegan

""Intelligent"" -- didn't comprehend why I took an Uber to a date *at a bar*

""Loves to travel"" -- ""I've never been to another country"" (there's a legitimate argument to be made that these aren't mutually exclusive statements, but it varied wildly from my personal experiences)"

"My friend, whose dad just died, came up to me today between classes to say hi again. We had talked sporadically right before and after his dad died, but he's obviously been super overwhelmed.

We met on Yahoo chat. Loved her eyes, we chatted and slowly grew close.

She was a little bigger, but then I was 145kg myself so that wasn't an issue.  There was a little bit of creative photography on both sides. 

Eventually we got honest with our photos, then we met and fell in love. 

This girl moved state to be with me.  Then we both moved together for work and study.  Then she got sick so we moved state again.

During that time she packed it on. I got depressed for unrelated reasons.  She Got really big, almost as heavy as me I think. 

Loved her anyway. The eyes never lie. Got married.

Then, 4 years ago ahe got sick of it. Lost it all through surgery and hard work.  That encouraged me and I did too. Between us, we lost like 140kg.

Now, she gyms 3 or 4 times a week and is into powerlifting. I hate weights and I'm weak as fuck, but I bought a bike and I can jog 3 miles usually when I wanna, and I play cricket and gardening.

It's 2018. My wife is smoking hot, fit, a dozen years younger than me, and the eyes are still exactly the same.

You should be direct and straightforward if you’re interested in them because they otherwise wouldn’t know.

"You don’t really need a strict diet. [Here’s my eating log from yesterday](https://imgur.com/a/ArGkC) and I look [pretty lean](https://i.imgur.com/EZ3mqca.jpg) (I go through phases of cutting and bulking but I’m typically never above 11-12%)

What you need to do is eat correctly. Correctly doesn’t mean a ‘bro diet’ of baked chicken and rice. It means find your TDEE, eat 250-500 more than it when you’re bulking, 500-1000 less than it when you’re cutting, 180+ grams of protein (regardless of bulking or cutting), do resistance training (I recommend weight lifting at an actual gym on a good program made by someone who knows what they’re doing; not a random bro split or random 6-min abs workouts you find at home), and be patient. The most important part is consistency. If you’re doing everything correctly, you WILL see results. 

*About calories, measuring everything takes too long. The most important part about counting is NOT accuracy; it’s precision. Which means just make sure whenever you eat something, you put it in consistently. I eat at a dining hall so obviously when eating a chicken quesadilla, I’m not going to find the exact macros on the exact quesadilla they made. I just find one at a fast food restaurant and eye-ball it. As long as you’re decent at eyeballing, taking 5 mins to weigh every single thing at every single meal is unnecessary IMO

Also quick edit: I see a lot of comments from people who don’t really know what they’re talking about. You don’t need to eat a specific kind of fat or to avoid carbs to see results. You like bread? Fit it in your cals! You want rich-fatty ice cream? Did you save up the cals for it at the end of the day? Go for it!"

"The only thing you're doing wrong is expecting them to know how to take a compliment. If they ask you why you're being so nice, just tell them you were being sincere and it's no big deal.

"I stopped growing early so I got over any sensitivity about my height quickly. I'm not into the ""poor me for being short"" thing, I've honestly never had too much of a problem dating, but I have weird taste, so that might be it. That being said, try not to throw ""short"" around like an insult, please. I was with some friends and their girlfriends getting food after lots of drinking, and the girlfriends were talking about a guy who, in all fairness, was being far too persistent in trying to dance with them, but they added ""he was so creepy *and short*!"" as an insult, and it hurt my feelings only because it was said like his height was something gross or disgusting. They're both Asian, and all I could think was how all hell would break loose if I threw in ""*and Asian!*"" as an insult if I was talking about a girl who wouldn't leave me be. "

2. Trust your gut, if you don't think it's gonna work end it as soon as otherwise it'll just lead to more pain.

3. If they cheat on you, it's their loss. It does not mean you're not good enough it just means they're dumb enough not to realise how good they have it and somebody else will be lucky enough to have you.

Nothing is off limits. My sexual performance and proclivities. Graphic description of my genitals. My worst fears and failures. Embarrassing things from my past. Financial details including my fucking credit score. Any weakness or sensitivity I may have exposed to her. 

Every girl I've ever dated has betrayed my trust in this way. Every fucking one.

"
"* Let go. It's the best thing I learnt from past, letting go. If someone becomes disinterested in you, let her go. Someone isn't emotionally available? Let her go. I have made the mistake of not letting go for years which made me miserable. Recently, a girl I though could be awesome for me broke off everything. I let her go so quickly even I'm surprised.

* Don't think your happiness depends on her. Happy is happy, know that you'd be happy with someone else too(not with everyone).

* Be vulnerable. If you want to have genuine relationships, be vulnerable. Let them have the chance of hurting you and trust that they wouldn't. If they hurt you, it's better to know early on anyway.

* Know that people can leave and don't make them the only source of your happiness. If you do, as soon as they leave, you're going to be crushed."
"I started talking to my ex a few years after we broke up (as friends). She had a boyfriend I had a girlfriend. We were actually having quite a nice chat, partly about how happy I was with my girlfriend, and then boom, she starts sending nudes/masturbation videos telling me how much she wants me to fuck her. Gave my friend free reign on my account while I went to bed and he ended up repeatedly sending gibberish and asking her to melt butter all over herself until she had a hissy fit. Fun girl."
"I'm not a man but my old roommate was and I'm gonna share his Grindr story because it was hilarious.

So he tells me he's going to the bar to go meet up with someone, he'll be back in a few hours. I'm like okay that's cool, have fun and I move on. Well I'm hanging out with a friend so I'm not checking my phone but apparently he was sending me text after text after text of SOS.  

All the sudden he comes bursting through the door, out of breath and sweaty and scream rambling about how the guy only had pictures of his closed smile.

Apparently the guy he went to meet up with didn't have any fucking teeth.

My roommate apparently sprinted from the bar all the way back home when toothless went to the bathroom."
"Don't look, and then the right person will come along.

"Friends of friends. My personality is far more attractive than my face, so I've always had better luck meeting people through friends and making a connection that way than hoping someone thinks I'm handsome from across a bar or on a dating site/app."
It was my *privilege*
"LPT: If you take a picture, imagine it being spread everywhere before you send it. 

I’d have pretty ground to say “Wasn’t me.” But also even if it was proven, I’d shrug my shoulders and wait for the DM’s. Point is: Don’t shove a cucumber in your ass and send a picture of it unless you’re totally cool with everyone seeing that. "
That's just our regular patriarchy tbh
So did you guys bang?
"That was you, you f#@ker!"
It would’ve been great to record you feeding a cucumber to a donkey and send it to her.

"Last Tough Mudder I went to there was a Wounded Warrior Carry challenge.  I'm a 6' 2"" 180lb man, was running with my friend who's 5' 110lb soaking wet woman.  Rules stipulated that she had to piggyback me for half of it, so that was a pretty fun experience.  Happy to do my part."
I bet she did not want to be in a relrelationship.
Pretending to be distracted at work when a woman is trying to lift something so that rather than sighing or lookin at me she has to explicitly ask for help from a man 
Well one thing some girls do is that they don’t admit their feelings right away. I told 3 girls I liked them on separate occasions and instead of them saying how they felt they interrogated me about my feelings. It hurts cause I don’t know if there’s a future or if she just wants info to tell her friends. 
I enjoy hearing about people. I like knowing that people have things in their lives that make them happy in some way. That's the greatest reward of a successful thread.
"&gt;a tiny bit extremely lonely

isn't that funny how that happens. i'm pretty happy throughout my days. not much to complain about. but, if i'm not flooded with work or friends or family, and i'm just kinda relaxing, about to fall asleep, all of the sudden, my life has no meaning and i'm completely miserable because i have no one to be intimate and cuddle with."
"&gt; Are compliments THAT really foreign to men? 

Yes.

"Does it seem like everything is always somehow your fault? Do you find yourself apologizing for things you shouldn't have to? Are you constantly walking on eggshells to avoid upsetting her (him?)

"Man, this is too true. I dated a girl that thrived off drama. When I told her I wasn't going to play into it any more, she cheated on me just to get that last drama fix before I dumped her. She sobered up when I told her what I really think of her. I actually told her that she was poison. 

Years later she said I'd given her a wake-up call when I said that and she said she's a changed woman. It came at the expense of me being miserable for almost a year, but that's my charity work done for life. "

"Posted this before, but will forever be my best worst date.

I posted this before but here goes: Went on a tinder date for coffee. The girl is about 15-20lbs heavier than her pictures but hey, whatever, it's Tinder after all. So I ask her if she would like some coffee and she says, ""Ahh I can't drink caffeine."" Working in medicine my first reaction was, ""are you allergic?"" ""No....I'm pregnant."" I have no idea what to even say so I'm like ""uh, juice coming right up!""

So I buy a coffee for myself, and juice for her. I am not rude enough to just NOPE out of there, so I sit down and ask her ""so uh where....who is the father?"" She says, ""Well...it's between 1 of 2 guys, I'm not sure which.""
TL;DR: Tinder date was pregnant, two possible baby daddies. Did not meet up for second date."
"From a friend, that had a REALLY tough life, when I told him I didn't want to bother him with my, comparatively, minor issues. His answer: ""I don't care if it's a broken nail or something more serious. What I do care about, is how you feel about it, if it's an issue for you it IS worth talking about.

"We dated for a bit in an open relationship type thing. I fell off the dating when she started to get sloppy about who she fucked.
 
Now, she won't initiate conversations with anyone unless she knows they'll physically complement her. She has traveled thousands of miles to have sex with people that flirt with her. She doesn't seem to care about who she sleeps with, so long as she gets that validation. (People in closed relationships, married men who swear they're open but won't prove it, etc.)

Last time we talked, it was pretty much just about who she's sleeping with, or the one video game she plays. There's just not much substance to her anymore."

"So a number of years ago, when my older brother was still just dating his now wife, me and his girlfriends younger sister were pretty hot for each other, but we were both a bit hesitant about it because our siblings were dating.

One time when we were out camping with buddies, drunk around the campfire she tossed her army jacket at me and it wrapped over my head right as I was inhaling. It was more than just smells. I got goosebumps head to toe, shuddered, and immediately went fully erect.

It was a literal slap in the face of pheromones."
"No kidding.

I now know all kinds of stuff about who makes the newest exciting foundation and what the best makeup palettes are. I can tell you why Rihanna's makeup line is so great.

"There is this girl in my class who sits in front of me. She always answers everything the professor asks. Literally everything. She's really smart. Well, my professor asked the class a question and the girl was trying to answer it but she was stumbling. So under my breathe, I whispered the answer she was looking for. She said it out loud and the professor said she was right. 

That isn't what made my day. 

What made my day is the fact that I sit next to this girl who I find really attractive. After I whispered the answer, the girl who sits next to me looked over at me and gave me the biggest smile, acknowledging that she knew I gave the other girl the answer. 

That didn't just make my day, it made my whole week.  "

"""Thank you all for being here tonight.""

""This really is a wonderful occasion.""

Make a self deprecating joke.

Talk a little about the groom. Tell a funny story at his expense.

Tell a story about when he met the bride. If he was initially nervous, work that detail into the story.

Transition that story into how much better the groom is with the bride in his life.

""The bride's family are so nice and wonderful. I am so excited to be a part of their family and that they'll be a part of ours.""

""This really is such a wonderful occasion. I couldn't be happier for the bride and groom.""

""Again, thank you all for being here.""

"Originally met in third grade, but I wanted nothing to do with her at the time, because she was mean to me. We went to the same middle and high schools, but never really talked apart from knowing each other as peers. We reconnected a few months after college, at a mutual friend's birthday, and officially began dating a few weeks later. Long story short, we are getting married in August, and are absolutely inseparable.

From worst enemy to love of my life..."
"At work. 

She was a manager for our training department and I had just started as a Java developer. It was my first day and I was being introduced individually to everyone in our IT department. According to her she said that the second she met me she had to have me. 

I was recently divorced and had no interest in any LTR. I was perfectly fine being single and enjoying life. 

Fast forward 6 months and I had to work with her on a training project. She kept dropping hints, I knew where it was going, but I really didn't wanna fuck up my job, considering it was my dream job, by dating anyone from work. I'm sure I made it clear, even though I didn't explicitly say so.

Fast forward another 3 months and our entire IT department had an end of the Fiscal Year shindig at a winery. She made it a point to sit next to me and try to talk with me that evening. I made sure that it was known that I had a date that evening and was gonna go clubbing in San Diego, about 20 minutes away. However being a gentleman she had a glass of wine and I told her to text me to let me know she got home alright, which she did.

The day after she ended up calling me asking me how San Diego was. Had a great time and I made sure she knew I was with some arm candy all night. She said she had never been clubbing. I saw this as an out, and suggested a bunch of us go down there and find her a man. Again, I did not want to fuck up my job. The next weekend several of us go down there. My arm candy decided at the last minute not to go, but still, everything was cool. Two co-workers bailed early in the evening, which just left me and her and her friend from work. I kept trying to talk her up to other guys, but no dice. 

She goes to the bathroom and after she comes back tells me some guy grabbed her butt. Me, fucking around, I say ""oh, you mean like this?"" And I just casually grab hers. That was a green light for her apparently. It was already late, so the three of us take off. We drop off her friend at her BF's apartment, and I drive her home. Getting back to her house I walk her up to the door, which is a long way from the street. I'm seriously just trying to be a gentleman and had no intention of anything else. She went on for a hug, and I reciprocated, but instead she moved and kissed me. I started to back away, but (sigh) I just let it happen. By now it was past 1am. She quickly unlocks the door and pulls me inside. 


We end up dating, but not saying anything to anyone at work about it. She had already been divorced twice and me once. There is a certain stigma about that, but after you find out the details behind it you realize that it was bad decisions on her part with the wrong guys. It didn't really make me feel any better, but I knew who I was, and I sure as shit wasn't like them. 

Anyways, we got married a little over a year later in a very quiet ceremony in Las Vegas and kept it a secret for a year from everyone, including our families and our kids. It's now been almost 15 years since then, and we're very happily married."

"&gt;I wanted to make sure I wasn’t going on a date with someone shallow

This makes no sense to me. She used pictures of someone else to attract someone. By the very nature you agreed to date, at least part of it was based on physicality. Being a bit pissed off and possibly bailing because of what actually turns up isn’t being shallow. It’s being let down by deception. There was an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSON in front of you, and I bet she looked even less appealing physically after being lied to. When I order a nice-looking toaster, of course I’m going to care about it’s crumb tray and whether it actually heats the bread up, but if I ordered it in black and a pink one arrived, I’m sending it back. It’s the lies I can’t stand. "

"Woman at her first conference ever during her first week working where I worked.

She's on anti-psychotic meds, proceeds to go to the hospitality suite and load up on alcohol, getting SUPER wrecked. We had been hanging out and I had been showing her the ropes, so I went with her on one of her copious smoke breaks. On the way downstairs, this woman, drink in hand and smelling like a frat party, gropes my ass and slurs:

&gt;D'ya wanna pfffffuck me?""

I said ""No. and I think you're done with this"" as I grabbed her glass of hard liquor and dumped it in the trash for her.

Between getting shut down and the many problems she had, she ended up freaking out and throwing a tantrum outside the hotel - where quite a few big names in our industry and colleagues could see her flailing about.

Over the course of the evening, she tried to throw herself off an overpass (probably for attention) so I and another coworker had to stop her, then she rolled around in some gravel screaming and crying about how no one wants her. 

My first time being molested AND first time seeing someone black out drunk.

Watching her remember all that shit the next day was hilarious. Especially the text I get in the morning:

&gt;What happened last night? And why is there gravel in my bed?"

She was at work and I was a customer, was she just being nice because it's her job? Is she actually attracted to me? Is she like OP and just trying to be nice and give more compliments? Maybe she's single and thinks I'm good looking enough to give a chance?

I responded with ""Thanks, I grew it myself!"" Then finished paying for my food and went back to my table and waited for pizza, she went to the kitchen. She even had cute pink hair and a few tattoos which I'm totally into and probably would have complimented her on if my brain wasn't so occupied trying to figure out how to respond to her compliment."

"During college, there was this girl who was a film major. She had a lot of classes with a guy named joe, so they would do a lot of projects together. Sometimes they would ask joe’s friend jason to act in their films. And sometimes they’d tell jason to bring friends so he’d bring Rick. And then one time Rick brought his roommate munkykiller, and munkykiller saw the girl and was smitten. 

Munkykiller was apparently stupidly obvious about it, so as he continued to hang out with this gang, the fellas would always make sure that wherever they went, if there was sitting to be done, the seat next to the future Mrs munkykiller would be empty. Future Mrs munkykiller also had a car, so if there was any driving, the passenger seat in her car would be empty. 

The boys were really helpful, and it’s worked out. Recently had our 23rd anniversary. 

Hope you meet someone and with or without the help of a gang of dudes, it works out and you are happy together. "

"Yes, compliments really are so foreign that we don't know how to react. 

If a female friend of mine said ""you look really handsome today"" I'd be so confused, is she mocking me? is she trying to flirt with me? just a thoughtful friend? 

Complimenting guys on their looks is great, but its difficult to get it right. 

It's easiest to compliment a guys work, we get that sometimes and won't be so caught off guard, next is talent - its easy to acknowledge someone who is a good singer for example, and if he is a good singer he'll likely have heard it before. The next is his personality - this is your best bet in my opinion, its very rare for us to get complimented on who we are and it requires you to know them personally so it'll be that much more appreciated. 

the closest I've ever come to being complimented on the way I look is another guy saying he likes my clothes/style."
"Don't talk someone into dating you. Ask once, *maybe* twice if they seemed to be caught off guard the first time and are now showing signs of looking at you differently. But after that, move on. They're saying no for a reason.

Edit: To elaborate on how I learned this, my first relationship was a result of me asking multiple times and finally winning her over. We were together for 2.5 years after that, and it wasn't even a case of her not being as into me--it eventually became pretty equal in that way. We were just very different people with completely different (and incompatible) outlooks on life. I think she sensed this in the beginning, and that was part of her reluctance."
"This is the right response. Most guys weren't taught to give a simple thank you to compliments, so they get super uncomfortable because they're just not used to it. Its an unfamiliar situation.

That being said, just because guys don't know how to respond doesn't mean they don't appreciate it. They do, they just have a hard time showing it"

"Oh no, that's not a line for the ""one of the guys"" girls to use (unless you want to actually fuck them). Its reserved for male on male interaction and only after years of friendship."
"Men just deal with it differently and so the signs you were looking for that they are struggling will not be there since the ones you looked for are likely the signs women tend to show in such situations. Men and women deal with stress and struggles and even emotions rather differently, especially in the context of interactions with their friends.

And yes, men really fundamentally get almost no real compliments. Most men will react awkwardly to genuinely meant compliments as a result. They'll try to joke off of it to relieve the tension or question if they are being mocked."
"Talked with a girl online who looked like a real cutie, kind of an emo look. When we met up on our first date she put absolutely no effort into her appearance, like she had just rolled out of bed, and frankly looked like a completely different person as if she was ill or something. Met her a few more times, as friends, and I have still yet to see her put any effort into her appearance. It's kind of bs if you only post the most flattering pictures you have of yourself but then never put effort in when meeting people or going on a first date."

"Getting some good responses, so I'll add my own. 

-Willingness to ruin a special occasion over something small - for example if you go out for their birthday, and they decide they're mad at you, them not talking to you and ruining the night   Rather than just letting it go and talking about it later. 

-going out of their way to please you, but getting upset when you don't do the same. Like the example I used, they'll leave work to go take care of you if you have a minor cold, but would get mad if you can't do the same. 

-insisting on not being the reason you cant see family or friends, so encouraging you to see them, but then getting mad when you actually do it, despite denying they are mad. 

-giving you one word responses to texts and in person if you don't say exactly what they want.  Them sitting in silence waiting for you to backtrack and say what they want to hear. 

-tearing you down when they feel shitty and building you up when they feel good.  When you get a text from them, not knowing which it's going to be.

-always assuming you meant to hurt them and responding accordingly to every small misunderstanding. No benefit of the doubt whatsoever. 

-""just break up with me then"" every time you try to bring up their toxic behavior 

-""if you love me you'll.....""

Damn this is more than I thought I'd have but it's therapeutic to type this all out. 

UPDATE: I just thought of another one

"If you mean their natural scent, then you are talking about reactions to pheromones and the expression of various [genes.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_odour_and_sexual_attraction)

Deodorant can mask these natural scents, and we're not sure what effect this has. Anecdotally, when I was in college there was a girl in my extended group of friends. She was in good shape as she was a dancer, but facially she was a bit plain (i.e. she didn't plaster her face in makeup every day like the other girls.) I never really noticed her much, but she broke her leg one time, and once when we were hanging out she asked me to help her off the floor where she'd be stretching. I lifted her up with my forearms under her shoulders, and I don't think she had showered as it was early morning and she was in PJ's. Later when I smelled my arms, she'd left a very strong and very pleasant natural body scent on them, and that night I shit you not I had vividly sexual and emotionally intense dreams about her, and developed a major crush on her for months afterward. Before you ask, no I was too chicken shit to ask her out. I guess we were very genetically compatible perhaps.

So I can kinda see where the science is coming from there. Yet another way that Tinder messes with sexual selection. The girl you just swiped left on may well have set your soul on fire if you could smell her."

She was a virgin by choice, and there’s nothing wrong with that at all. But here’s the thing: she would CONSTANTLY remind people that she was a virgin in order to come off as some angel or some role model that everyone should look up to. There are so many Instagram posts of her posing in revealing clothing and then passively throwing in that she’s a virgin. It’s like ok shut up we get it. 

She was a REALLY hot girl. Pretty hair, nice curves, nice sized breasts; all that stuff. She knew she was hot, and because of this, she would constantly brag about how many guys tried to hit on her and how many of them she rejected. It’s like if any guy came up and started flirting with her, and she turned him down in the end, she HAD to tell me ASAP in order to boost her own ego. She thought she was impressing me but it was really annoying. 

In the end I came to the conclusion that she was a very insecure women. While we were DATING (not even officially together yet), she accused me of trying to get with one of my coworkers. Id like to add that me and the girl that I was dating haven’t even kissed yet. Later on down the road she got drunk one night and started making out with her “play husband” as she likes to call it.

"A “good” driver doesn’t just obey the law, they also PREVENT accidents. Being aware of other cars around you, predicting when one will try to merge, knowing when to be assertive or cautious... all of these are important. Predicting bad situations is much more valuable than reaction."
One of the big red flags is isolation.  Do they insist you spend less time with family and friends than before? 
"Every single day, by my wife. We have survived too many jobs, too many lousy bosses (reveled in the rare few good ones), and too many moves. Toss in divorces and deaths of friends and relatives and some days we just clung to each other. Spent a day with an old friend and her new husband. They both chose better the second time around. I made it through cancer (five years clean). My chances of lasting this long were zero. Every day is a good day."

"I think that deep down, all humans thrive off of at least a little bit of drama.  Some people like more than others, but even the most laid back people I know talk about interpersonal stuff sometimes. It's important to avoid people who create it unnecessarily, but I think we have to accept that being in relationships (friendships, romantic, etc) with other humans will entail at least some drama. 

That being said, I think that a lot of people who were raised around a lot of drama and conflict tend to try to create it more because that's what they're used to, myself included. I witnessed a nasty divorce as a kid and sometimes I have to fight the urge to start things over nothing. "

"There was actually a recent court case in the Netherlands where a female fireman who was fired for not meeting the standard sued arguing that it was not fair that female or elder people were held to the exact same standard as a male in his prime. Not sure what came of it though but I hope she lost.

If you have a disability that precludes you from becoming a fireman that's obviously tough for you but I don't think lives should be endangered to allow someone in a wheelchair to become a fireman.

Also there's not a single female in the marines—apparently about 10 try every year to meet the physical tests and this is a branch that rejects 90% of the males who apply; females may apply but are held to the exact same standards."

"Kitchens are much like prison, or the animal kingdom. Op would have to assert dominance.

"I once drove alongside a tractor trailer on a bumper to bumper highway through the mountains (the perfect storm of Pennsylvania road construction, some weird racetrack having a race, and a college football game) for almost 2 hours. My husband and I were checking out his truck, it was very shiny and looked well-cared for. As we parted ways at last, he honked and waved to us. I could've shed a tear. I thought I was the only one that got overly attached to fellow drivers when we've been together for such a long time."

"I know that feel, bro. 

Except, worse than the nights alone in your bed or in the car driving, is in fact having that realization in the fun moments. I remember being on a boat for my fucking birthday, surrounded by friends and booze and music. I had a job, was in good health, have a great family, and look decent. I had a million things to be thankful for. And in the midst of all that, sitting there on that fucking boat, I thought, ""I just wish I had someone to text right now."" 

Bummed me out a lot. 

Keep up the good attitude, though. Never stop being thankful. I can't tell you it will happen, but I can tell you it is statistically probable. And when it does, you'll want to be the guy/girl who's a boss at positivity, thankfulness, and cultivating peace on their own when you do."
"Before I started going to the gym regularly, I didn't care all that much despite the fact that I kept myself in decent shape. After I started going regularly, I started to find athletic women really attractive.

So I'd say its important because it can be a good shared interest to  have and being fit (or at least working towards it) is sexy."

"Every man now gets two seats on planes and busses. One for us, and once for our outstretched leg, cause we gotta let the boys get some air.

"I'll admit, I love my hookups/freelance sex-capades, and despite this knowledge, still avoid these profiles, because there is too much ""crae"" following the hookup.

"So this is probably going to be a hard sell, but makeup. It's easy to respect lots of hobbies: any sort of art, craftsmanship, scholarly, athletics, etc. Nerdy/fandom stuff is pretty in vogue, and I assume plenty of guys here have no issues seeing depth in those.

I was always super skeptical of makeup, high fashion, all that. Still am, just more sympathetic. Dated a girl once though that showed how creative someone could be with it. There was a real method, art to it. Understanding of colors, balance. Room for experimenting. I don't think it's a coincidence how many girls go into costume make up, it's a natural extension of it.

Still prefer no make up and such, but I learned to appreciate there can be something deep to it."
"I think the difference is that men are not allowed to NOT be confident. The second we doubt ourselves we're told it's not attractive. Idk about other guys here, but I could be getting my soul sucked out and I'm still going to put on a smile and act like everything is fine. Unless I'm physically I'll I'm always going to pretend things are great. "

"Met an asian girl on tinder. We hit it off really well, had similar interests, she wanted someone to practice English with, and she was really cute to boot. Met up for some tea and snacks at a little coffee shop, and I could see her being cute 50 pounds and quite a few years ago without the butch haircut. It's a shame, because she was really charming, but I felt scammed since she had intentionally shown herself to be much younger and cuter than she was. We hit it off well, but lying at the outset of meeting is a huge red flag, not even considering the fact that I found her incredibly unattractive. I deleted her number and tinder right afterwards."

"It's the multiplayer zeitgeist of the moment. A few years back, it was all about Call of Duty, or Halo, or Gears of War. Now this particular genre has exploded with Fortnite and PUBG.

"Lack of emotionnal stability. 

My ex was like that. Her emotions were ""very""...when she was sad, she was *very* sad. Angry ? No, *very* angry ! She couldnt be just mildly happy. When she was happy, it was the best time of her life. It was so draining. I cant deal with this. Im too empathic and it affects me a lot. No thx !"

"There's a difference between having multiple partners in the past and crawling in to the bed of an almost complete stranger. I'm 100% fine with a girl who has been with her share of guys and is comfortable sexually, but I'd probably pass on dating a girl like OP described."
"When they feel threated by you without knowing you. So I'm a larger guy, 6'1, probably about 240. And when I'd walk to my car during college, itd be like 5pm and there always seemed to be like some girl in front of me, and not many people around. Usually you'd notice them starting to walk fast, look back a few time, and get in their car in a hurry. Granted, I was usually in flip flops, probably looking the least threating. I understand 100% why a girl would feel odd about some random guy following her and not blaming them for their actions. It just would make me sad a little, one being, do people really see me as threating. Then also, sad that society has gotten to a point where people have to fear others like that, not saying it is anything new."
"This will be unpopular, but I take with a grain of salt any dating advice given from an attractive guy. They're just not playing the same game as me. The things that work for them won't work for me.

- Just be yourself. I'm myself all the time and I get laid pretty often

- Just get on Tinder, bro.

- Just smile at her. She'll definitely smile back and then you can start flirting

- Just treat her like a human being. I just drift through life treating girls like human beings and magically I end up with lots of numbers and dates. You can do the same!

It's like... I dunno a good analogy. A white guy telling a black guy ""Bro, I don't know why cops keep messing with you on the road. You just gotta have a positive attitude and then the police will stop pulling you over. Works for me everytime"". I'm sure it does but we are in two different worlds here."
"Yes, compliments are incredibly rare in comparison.

By the way you're telling us, however, you're overdoing it. It's fine to be a bro and give a few compliments here and there, but the way you're describing, it feels kind of like: ""Oh, a compliment? How nice! I don't know how to react, but thank you."", then you compliment again in a short period of time, and again, and it soon turns into ""okay, what does she want?""

A lot of men (dare I say most) don't get just ""free compliments"" often, if any, but we do get 'em when people want something from us. Of course, we're clueless and we can't tell the difference.

EDIT: Oh, also, I guarantee you that your compliments have made someone's day already. They'll just never tell you. We're stupid like that, but it's appreciated."

"I always kind of thought it was weird for a guy to have sex with a girl really early on in dating and then have that totally change their opinion of the girl.  Like, why are you only judging her?

"Met a girl who managed to fool me, an expirienced tinder dater, with fat girl magic pictures that made her face look cute and her body slim. It was the same girl, but with an uglier face and chubby. She was also insanely boring, lived with her mom etc etc. When we first locked eyes I could see the guilt, she knew she'd fooled me and there was like this unspoken conversation between us that took place in seconds. ""Yes this is me, yes I am fat, are you still going to buy my food?"" and I was like ""yeah, you got me good, you earned your lunch""

So I bought her lunch, was nice enough and made an excuse after 30 minutes of talking about her favorite disney characters, never called her again.
