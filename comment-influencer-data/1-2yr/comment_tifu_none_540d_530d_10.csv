I've been stressing about my gf finding out it was me who blocked the toilet by using her scented face wipes to clean my ass. I'm still in a lot of trouble but I'm glad I'm not you
As someone who could be that stranger on a plane beside you one day: I would much rather you wake me up to go pee rather than piss in a bottle right beside me.

"As a researcher, seems kind of sketchy that you wouldn't get *any* compensation, unless they're tossing all of your data as well. You're generally compensated for your time and participation, not for your samples, but I suppose it can vary from study to study. I personally feel that it would start to border on coercion if you were to tell a participant, effectively, ""Do you want the full $6000? Well then you need to do X, Y, Z.""

For example, if we call in a study participant for a study visit, we would compensate them the full amount for that visit, regardless of procedures they complete. This is because we called them in, and it has taken a part of the participant's day to come in for the visit.

Usually, studies will provide compensation in increments. So the total is $6,300, but you get $X for baseline, $Y for each follow-up, $Z for study completion.

TL;DR: This whole thing sounds ethically questionable"

"I don't really think you should blame yourself. Student A is absolutely correct, taking time out of class to specifically ream you out for something that really should not have even caught her attention is not what the teacher should have been doing. And especially to react so publicly hostile toward you after you apparently apologized, saying in front of the whole class that YOU ""ruined"" the lesson already. Seems like she needs a refresher on how to maturely act as a teacher. Was the teacher aware that you are on a ""certain"" spectrum and may have academic troubles because of such? If so, her behavior is even more inappropriate. 

Don't be too hard on yourself. You didn't really do anything wrong and could have never predicted that your small reaction would set off that specific chain of events. If anything, I would make it very clear to your principle/head of your school that your class and you specifically did not outwardly mean to cause your teacher such emotional distress and that your entire class just felt that you were not being treated fairly and that her reaction was not justified for what the situation actually was. To avoid some of the awkwardness of her return, you could again reiterate your regret (as an individual OR as a class, I guess)"

"I had pilonidal cysts during my last year of high school, and had the surgery before I started college. They were embarrassing, because they'd emit an odor just from me sitting in class and sweating at all during the spring and early summer months, and it always made me feel self conscious.

It wasn't fun. The pain sucked too, but wasn't as bad as the shame. I was scared about the surgery and expected that to hurt even more, but it didn't. It was actually a relief. I only used painkillers a couple of times before I realized I didn't need them."

"when my daughter was around 2 or 3. We have always tried to push our own music interest on her which included alot of bob marley from my wife. She (my toddler) has always reffered to him as ""the bob"" while shopping one day she began freaking out yelling excitedly ""look mom its the bob"" while pointing directly at a dude with dreds, we knew instantly what she was talking about. We all had a good laugh 

Edit:
1. was informed she was only 1 and a half at the time
2. To clarify we do not force our child to listen to any certain music she just had to listen to what we liked as she was to little to have opinions at that age (I miss those days). now that she has one we have to deal with 24/7 requests to play ""bad blood"" "

"When I was 15 my left testicle decided to go back up into the abdomen. So I had surgery to bring it back down.

What triggered me to get myself checked out, was this dude who was making fun of me in shop class said, ""suck my left nut!""

I quietly realize that I don't have a left nut and started freaking out. Like where the f*** did it go? 

My doctor had me take very warm baths for a month and had me massage my pubic area to see if it goes down by itself before I had the surgery...... the weirdest part was that I could actually feel it in my abdomen when I pressed on my pubic area can you imagine getting kicked in the pubic area and feeling like you got kicked in the balls? Goddamn that was a weird chapter of my life. That was the same year I thought I had herpes even though it turned out my lips were just super chapped and always burning. High school was a horrible time.

"I'm from Texas, and I went to college in the Boston area.  One year I was driving home for break and had to stop for gas in New Jersey.  I'd gotten a late start so it was well after midnight and (I thought) I was the only person at a gas station in the middle of nowhere.  Never have I felt like I was absolutely going to die more than when as I started pumping my gas, a strange man came out from behind the station and approached me.  As my life was flashing before my eyes and I'm was trying and massively failing to dial 911, he pulled the pump out, waited for the printer, and calmly handed me a receipt."

"Sounds about right.  When I was in 8th/9th grade I was at my best friend's house and his twin brothers in first grade had just been caught looking at porn. His mom found it in the search history and new it was them because they were searching ""big boobz"" ""boobs n butts"" and ""Lego boobies"".  She knew it couldn't have been anyone else cause we all knew how to clear the search history."
I know I'm probably gonna get down voted for saying this but if someone is willing to leave someone they are married/have kids with for you don't be surprised if you received the same treatment later down the line. Although I don't know her in the slightest nor do I know you in the slightest.

"I didn't get any compensation because I didn't complete the first stay, which was 4 days (3 nights).  They were upfront about when they paid out.  $675 per 4 day visit, and the remaining at the end follow up.

"This reminds me of when I was a little kid and my dad took me to blockbuster to get the movie Pirates of the Caribbean. Unfortunately I couldn’t find it but I did find this movie called Pirates which I figured was the same movie with a different name (I was not very bright). We got the movie, drove home, and put the movie in, then my dad went outside to smoke a cigarette. Within the first minute I realized this was not at all the right movie due to the pretty immediate graphic sex scenes. Pirates turned out to be a PORNO. So my little sister and I were watching a porno for about 15 minutes until my dad came back inside. Good times."
I will not imagine this.

That's so weird. I work in engineering and we bs and swear all the time. It's super casual
But even after surgery there is a ~34% chance that you will get it again. Which of course is what happened to me.

"I don't see this as your fault at all. The teacher was going to have a bad day no matter what triggered it, and her being emotional in class prior to this only supports my feeling that she should take a break from teaching if she can't keep it together in class.

The brief conversations I've had with her left me smiling for hours like an idiot. There are hotter and more beautiful women, and objectively more attractive people, but no one comes close to how fucking insanely beautiful I find her. It scared me then and still kind of does. After three years I've managed to section off my mind and accept being alone (not that I don't have friends, but compared to being near her, everything is being alone). 

To anyone who hasn't felt it, I'm worried it sounds creepy or weird, but at this point I am just wholly appreciative that she exists as a person in the world, and that's enough for me, and I hope that she finds someone who does what she does to me, for her.

Long story short, it might seem hard to cut it off, but you two aren’t really a couple yet. You haven’t been through hell and back for each other.

"My friend’s mother did this. She has a garden in her back yard with a bunch of plants she uses for traditional Asian cooking. One day they found her unconscious, and took her to the ED. She had a couple of seizures, and when she came to she was delirious. To the point that she was speaking incoherently and too confused to recognize her own son. They had to put her in 4 point restraints because she was climbing out of the bed, pulling out her IV lines, etc. Eventually (once her lines were removed) they had to put her in a net bed, which is basically like a heavy duty mesh tent over a bed. It can only be opened from the outside, so the patient stays safe and can’t escape. She’s in her 50’s and works as a correctional officer in a prison, so not an old and frail person. 

After over a week in the hospital, she finally became completely lucid again. It was *really* scary for the family because they had no idea what happened, and all of the traditional medical tests (CS fluid, scans, blood tests) were not yielding any answers. The docs told them early on it was likely a toxicity to something, but without knowing what she ingested they couldn’t test for it if they wanted to. They don’t actually know which plant she ate, but they found mushrooms amongst the other stuff she had brought in the house that day and the last thing she remembered was picking stuff out of her garden."

For real. Kinda related story:

When my cousin was in school his teacher came in looking quite under the weather, and opened the class by stating that she's had a 'less than ideal weekend'. My cousin asked 'what's wrong miss?"" and she just demanded ""Go down the the head's office for that remark, J"" 

Confused, but obedient, he goes to the head's office. He comes out and asks my cousin why he's there. ""I don't actually know, but Miss [name] sent me"". The head then sent him back to class. Upon returning, the teacher complained that he 'never saw the head at all did you?', and sent my cousin *back* to the headmaster's office.

Eventually, the headmaster actually walked with my cousin back to the classroom, took the teacher outside, she cried and left for the day."
"I live in a mostly white part of the UK. You see a few people of Asian and Indian origin but not as many black people. Well when I was a kid, maybe 4/5, my sister was 2/3.

"I was in a church group several years ago, and I had obtained what I thought was a bootleg copy of a movie that hadn't been released on DVD yet, but was incredibly popular.  We got a bunch of people together, and were going to have a showing of this movie for everyone.  

I didn't preview it first because I didn't want any spoilers... And that's where I fucked up.  Even though the title clearly stated it was this movie... It turns out it was this very graphic porn with people speaking sweedish and wearing masks"
"OP, this is not your fuck up. Any other teacher in their right mind would have reacted to this situation playfully, and it was perfectly reasonable for any student to find it amusing. This was an innocent moment that she took to heart all to easily, which makes it pretty obvious that she has some serious shit on her plate that you can't blame yourself for. While it's certainly unfortunate, you can't be held accountable for where someone else is in life, especially when you're unaware of it. Showing respect for an authoritative figure and walking on eggshells around them are two different things. At the end of the day, she gets paid to retain her composure."

"(Don't read if you don't want unsolicited advice.)

Ive received quite a bit of hate for this comment and would like to clear some stuff up before everyone starts shitting their pants. 

I’ve been a certified red seal plumber for nearly 7 years and have been with the same company since starting my apprenticeship, I also do have quite a few more certifications over everyone else in my company making me a valuable employee. My boss and I always get into little arguments here and there. One thing I was taught and live by was don’t take shit from no bitch. Its one thing to work at a grocery store or in fast food where you’re forced to be wipped and do your bosses bidding, and another thing to work in construction where the environment is alot different  and what I would describe as aggressive. 

So before you go trumping around making assumptions maybe ask some questions first.

Thank you for explaining what it means to be a valuable employee u/crybannanna

Imagine. It. Now.
"Kind of similar situation. A few months back, I invited this girl I just started dating to meet my friends while we played trivia. The next time we hung out, she mentioned she matched with one of my friends on a dating app, planned to go out with him, but ended up ghosting him. I told her it wasn't that big a deal, and my friend would even try to set me up with people he's dated in the past. I thought the date ended well, we made out for a bit at the end, but she started ghosting me after that date. I really liked her :/ "

"I am blessed with not being a very hairy person, but I have this one rogue bastard hair in my nose - only one - that won't fucking give up the ghost. It doesn't just grow, it grows like a god-damn vine. Its ambition is to escape my nose and instantly turn towards the sun and move upwards. 

Bear in mind that I'm a woman so there's no ability to disguise this thing as part of a mustache or whatever. I have no noticeable hair on my face *except* this utter fucker. So I have to pluck it. Yes I could trim it down, but that just reduces the amount of time before the fucking thing re-emerges. So plucking it is. And it's horrific. It's like being punched in the face by the God of Sneeze. And, yeah, vomiting has taken place too.

That little shit. I understand your pain. "

"One of my first few days as an ER scribe, I was with a PA and a young Mexican girl comes in complaining of a cyst on her ass. It’s a pilonidal cyst and she says she’s had them multiple times a year since she was young. She said that if she did not personally keep up with and clean it, the cyst would get so large that she’d have to come to the ER. This time it was the biggest shed ever seen. We poke her ass a few times with lidocaine and she starts sobbing. She was like 19, with her pants down and ass cheeks spread. So uncomfortable for her. But when we got that sucker open, a deep stench filled the room, almost similar to necrotic tissue and probably was. Thick egg white yellow pus with scarlet glitter blood drained out the cyst and down her crack and hole. We squeeze that thing for like five minutes after the initial cuts and it just keeps draining. You could have fit an eight ball into that pilonidal cavity. And so we stuck blunt forceps in there and pulled out more gunk. It was just ridiculous. Had to keep poking her with more lidcocaine because there was just so much tissue and so much pressure. There were multiple pops that kept coming as we bluntly explored the cavity. 

Now this was like my 2nd To 3rd shift after training so my 7th-8th shift overall. It was a trauma 1 ER and yet this cyst is still so much more vivid in my mind than most of the cool stuff like knife evulsions, gunshot wounds, and some crazy broken bones. Maybe cause of the smell? I just remember that as soon as the scalpel poked through the skin, the room filled with dead body BO bouillon cube fragrance and I was met with the reality of my career choice. And I fell sickly in love. "

Plumber here. If you ever use cleaners down the drain always have a damp towel on hand and cover the drain once you have poured the chemical down. They usually call for 1-2 mins to let it sit and work and then to flush the system with hot water. If the chemicals do not work and you call plumber always let them know what you have poured down so they don’t get it on them from snaking or removing the piping.

"The Amanitin family seems to aforementioned effects,

Quoting namyco.org:

First stage is a latency period of 6 to 24 hours after ingestion, in which the toxins are actively destroying the victim's kidneys and liver, but the victim experiences no discomfort.

Second stage is a period of about 24 hours characterized by violent vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and severe abdominal cramps.

Third stage is a period of 24 hours during which the victim appears to recover (if hospitalized, the patient is sometimes released!)

Fourth stage is a relapse, during which kidney and liver failure often occurs, leading to death."

Honest advice regarding relationships: listed to your heart (is this the right person), but let your brain calculate (is the game worth the candles). Heart does not get saying in what you do, it got saying only if the person fits, thats all. If heart approves but brain does not, dont do it. Not to mention ideal situation where heart and brain approves, you will be in way less trouble if your brain approves but heart does not.
Also, DO NOT BEND your mind to please your heart. Thats very important."
Much better (but too short to be great).
