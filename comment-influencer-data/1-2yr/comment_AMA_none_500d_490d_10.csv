"The most significant change we have seen happen over the years, is how much safer the world is today, I know the news is not full of good things, but the world compared to the one my wife and I were born into is much better than ever. 

Younger people think the world is much worse, but it's not, there is always going to be bad moments, but the world is much better than ever. There may be some people holding some progress back, but the world has moved on so much more than we imagined back in the day. 

The nicest change is the way of living, I know some people don't have it easy, but the way of living has improved so much. 

The worst change is not some things have not changed, some of the things that my wife and I faced is still around in subtle ways, which is sad. 

The best advice we have ever received was from my wife's father after the war. He told us to live our lives to the fullest and be the person we want to be no matter what, he went through two world wars and was a hopeful guy, he just wanted the best and knows that life will never stop being happy and hopeful. "
Get a lawyer. You are the partner right now. You could end up paying child support for a kid that's not even yours. Cover your ass now. 
Well she's cheating on you. I'd be done with it. 
"Yes, it is our Platinum Wedding this year on the 15 of July! "
That means it must be your Platinum wedding this year! 
"The best advice is that there are going to be bumps in the relationship where you think it's going to be the end, but you have to find the good in each other and work pass your flaws. Some people think that people have to be flawless and are not prepared to take on their partners flaws, but you have to know that you both are not perfect and love each other for who you are. 

Also, surprise each other every once in a while! "
Shit really. I'll look into that thank you.
Have you ever killed a baby?
"The most terrifying encounter we both faced was when we found out that some people from Manchester were hunting Jewish people to give to the Nazis in exchange for something (it was unknown what it was) so my wife, her family and I had to hide in our house for weeks and we could hear people crying and screaming so that was terrifying because everyday, we thought we were going to die. "
We got together our freshman year. This year would be our 5th year together. I really don't know what I'm going to do guys. 
"yes, 100 % yes. More times than I can recall"
Fuck it dude.  Lets go bowling.
"He’s a child molestor, and also a very dangerous man with absolutely no morals or saving grace."
"My wife was evacuating from London with her family during the blitz and they settled in Manchester (Where I lived). I was working with the local community to help people find homes while the blitz were affecting London. 

While I was working there, my wife was trying her best to help as many people as she could and we met one night while we were providing food to the people. We stayed together all night and we knew we were in love after about two weeks of her being in Manchester.  "
"When you were young, what did you think the year 2000 would be like?"
"Everybody goes a little crazy, people with severe mental issues before incarceration go absolutely bat shit insane and either kill themselves or get transferred to mental health units. I became hyper aggressive, severely depressed, I cut myself occasionally and tore my cell apart. The sheer silence of a lockdown is mind numbing and suffocating. Then the perpetual sound of people banging on cell doors, screaming and crying. Utter despair. Sleep is impossible. If you met me today I’m a different person to the wild animal I was in that fucking dungeon."
"My wife believes there is an afterlife, I didn't until I met her. If there was no afterlife, life is still worth the struggle because the rewards are much greater when you get through the struggle. "
old enough to drink dumbass :) 
Well done! Keep up the great work. 
"I tried to kill my stepfather with a claw hammer, he lived and is still living. I associated with a prison gang that was involved in a stabbing in another prison, so they moved us into supermax."
"First we'd go to a restaurant, see a theatre play and then head home for intimacy"
"What is, according to your opinion, the most significant change you have seen happen over the years? What would be the nicest change, and what would be the worst change? 

And, if i may ask another question, what is the best advice you have ever received?"
Will Smith's son
"I knew she was the one just after the world war when she helped everyone I loved recover and helped us rebuild. At that moment, I knew she was the one because she is caring, loving and she became my best friend. 

During a relaxing night at home, we were lying together on the sofa and I simply took the ring out of my pocket and asked her to marry me, I wanted it to be simple. "
"If you could have sex with one celebrity, who would it be?"
"When the cops pulled you over and asked what age you are, what did you tell them? "
"When you really think of it, you dodged a bullet with that one. If she was so desperate that a guy online could pick her up and ""convince her to leave her boyfriend"" the relationship clearly wasnt going anywhere. No one convinced her, she made the decision. Clearly she wasnt the right girl for you, but youll find another who actually appreciates you. Keep your head up!"
"I see you offer professional dog-sitting services.  
I need someone to take care of my Chihuahua for a week while I'm on vacation.  
What's the ""premium"" package?"
I would have to say any small wild cat like an Ocelot or a Margay. 
is there any right answer? Why such a hard question?
"When I was in the Marines a couple of the guys I hung around with were adopted.

One thing that helped one of my friends when shit gets bad at home remember that bio kids just pop up.

This family chose you to be their family.

They could have said no but they wanted you to be there.  They want you to be their family.



Also... even if you don’t feel like you need a councilor... talk to one.  At least once a month or so.

"Describe your last ex girlfriend with just a few words, really capturing the essence of what she is."
"1. It was a 23-24hr lockdown at the Allan B Polunsky unit in Texas. (Prison)

2. I tried to keep my mind active by reading/writing or listening to the radio. But I was levelled for the most part I was there (restricted) which meant I was only allowed law books and a bible. Exercising to the point of complete exertion to sleep through. But you really can’t cope in my opinion.

3. Tricky.

4. Very much so, my psych explained to me that the sort of isolation I endured is not something studied and easy to overcome. Night terrors, panic attacks and just generally isolating myself from others."
killing my own son
"1. Smoking a cigarette.
2. I’m a black cab driver in the UK.
3. No not really.
4. No 
5. I regret not killing him, he’s a plague. But I’d never do anything like that again.
6. No
7. No
8. 2 years
9. It wouldn’t be fair on the woman to be with me. "
You should probably get tested.  Maybe the dude she was with has herpes or something nasty.  And I also agree with u/fleshhook

"About a month after using the 0%. I was in Virginia for a wedding, and had to stop at a vape shop. I asked them for the same concentration of nicotine as the one I currently had. They pointed at the bottle and said “sooooooo... 0%?”. I went and told my now fiancé about this, and she was ecstatic. "
I would offer you a beer ...
fuckin pussy
"When you’re about to cum, what’re you typically thinking about? "
"whats the solution to this equation:

x + 4 = 8"
How did you not loose your mind and go insane? This is probably one of my bigger fears to be honest.
it was really disappointing. I got a lot of shit thrown at me at work.
Sounds amazing
No but I get that. Big crowds makes me very anxious and sleeping in complete darkness scares the shit out of me. Waking up and feeling buried alive. 
"Fine for now, get tested again in 6 months. Some viruses take 6 months to show up (less than but 6 months is standard for a follow up). I'm sure you're okay :)"
"I did, but only realized the cause in retrospect. I had written it off as from job stress, and received a placebo effect from the vaporizer. "
What do you like to do in your spare time?
"No question, just sayin' after ~40 years of smoking, I switched to vaping a couple of years ago and currently have cut my nicotine level in half (24mg to 12), so at this rate I'll be done about the same timeframe as you - well done and congrats!"

But I’m sorry if it’s rude "
"Also, if she does have the child - DON'T SIGN A GOD DAMNED THING and _demand_ a paternity test (even if you know for sure it's not your child, establishing that you're not the paternal father is _always_ a good idea.) If you sign any forms relating to the child that could be used against to establish parental rights (EG fatherhood that would  bind you to making support payments.) "
"Get a pet, like a dog or cat. They don't cheat, and they can give you a sense of fulfillment and love. Hang in there man, sounds rough!"
Good for you sir! What motivated you? Are you going to do it again in a couple days?
"It has just been so long. We were gonna get married. I trusted her more than anyone I've ever met family included. Like I know on a cosmic scale none of it matters, but dam it still hurts."
Don't try and work it out. It'll eat away at you day after day. Fuck her. You aren't the dad so you get a pass. 
Bankrobber- The Clash I could scream that song so the whole pod could hear. To piss others off but also because it’s a great song.
I usually smack it with a newspaper or my fist
I’m in dire need to of a holiday.
"You're going to mope for a bit, but then you are going to get back out there, that's what you are going to do!

But don't fuck her. Ever again.

Yes. Guards are why drugs can flood into the system. When I first arrived at polunsky I lived in 12 building which is the death row block before I was rehoused and those guys have had cell phones and drugs found in there cells. They’re all kept in solitary aswell.
Did you notice any withdrawal symptoms?
It is so fucking inhumane to do this to people. I am so sorry you went through this. To stop you from having to repeat answers ill go read others as to why you were in there.
Why would you do something so controversial yet so brave?
"I don’t know if this is helpful or not, but one way to look at this is that while it may feel like you wasted 5 years, her total lack of morals just cost her the next 18+ years of her life."
No not even close

"Disgusting 
I hope you find happiness in your new life and away from him and all the people that stood by him instead of you. 
The uk is a nice place. Portugal too, if you ever want a sunny vacation :) "
Yeah don't worry guys I left her and im currently staying with my best friend. Kind of broke right now but hopefully in a few months I can save up and get another apartment and car. I know I probably sounds stupid but I let her keep the car. Even though what she did really hurt me I still really care about her. Basically I'm an idiot. But I left her guys and after a while of saving up I'll be better.
Ironically enough she told me
Does being into an elevator scares you? I met someone who refuses to use them after being in the hole. 
What’s your name?
That is what our grandchildren and their friends have said to us. 
I went to a British embassy and claimed I couldn’t find work in the US due to my convictions and that I needed to see my family and me being a foreigner they obliged. My mother wired me money to fly back and see her since I hadn’t seen her in 16 years. I went back on an emergency passport and lied about what airport I would be arriving from and headed to London. I spent a year under observation.
"What kind of solitary confinement? In prison or elsewhere?

What was your way of coping in the situation?

"I’d advise against this. Alcoholism is a serious issue. Please don’t pick up drinking. 

Pick up a new hobby."
"5 years is not long. Be greatful you didn't marry her. My first wife cheated on me while I was deployed. Felt the same way you are. I moved on and 5 years later married my high school sweetheart, have two awesome little dudes, and it's been 12 years and going strong. Time heals!! Get a lawyer, make sure you're not on the hook for this kid and tell her to kick rocks. Focus on you and what makes you happy. Mrs right will come around, just stay the fuck away from this girl no matter what your feelings are. Think with the right head! 
"
If you’re in the Tucson area I’ll buy you a beer 🤷🏻‍♂️
I wish man im stuck in Sacramento 
For you future... you cant say you were working on a relationship if your solution was introducing her to thing you were addicted to and preferred to spend your time on mine. You wont keep any girl that way.
I'm doing shit
You bet your ass 
"Why didnt you just spend less time gaming? Might get downvoted but if it wouldve been a 'good working relationship', you wouldnt have to worry not to spend enough time with her (except for work/long distance and stuff).

Also, instead of introducing her to what you do all the time anyway it might have been a better idea to...just play less."
it was. The original question was 'tell me about your mother'

Does your list of regrets include nothing?
I was away for about a month in texas for my fathers funeral. While I was gone was around the time of conception. Sadly there really isnt any doubt.
How did it taste?
It probs wasn’t edited tbh be honest
"Late to he party on this, but had something similar happen six months ago... albeit without a pregnancy, but my girlfriend of 7.5 years, who was the most trustworthy, honest, dependable (hindsight.... lol) person I knew, did the dirty and left.

The baby isn’t yours, so I can’t see who would make you pay for it.... I’m from the UK and the fact that is even a possibility is even laughable, but for the sake of it, seem professional legal advice to be sure.

Next; focus on number one. You. You’re all that matters now. Don’t self destruct. Take a month. Blow off a bit of steam. Go out. Party. Try and have a good time. Surround yourself with friends. Make new ones. 

If you don’t already... hit the gym. I’m 31 years old. Never went to a gym before October last year. Best thing I ever did.

Once that’s done. Consider your situation. Do you live together? Own? Rent? Who’s moving out? Who’s staying? Can you afford it on your own? If you own will she let you buy her out? 

Self preservation is the order of the day. Don’t fall down a hole in self pity. There’s so much to do in a big wide world. It’s all yours. You’ve no ties. A fresh start. Smile. Carry yourself well. Be confident. You’ve got nothing to lose. 

Good luck dude! "
