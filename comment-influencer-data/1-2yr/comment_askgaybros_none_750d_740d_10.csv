"My husband met my parents way after he was an adult. He was southern as well, so had good manners and was a hit with the folks. One night we were all just talking and my dad said to him, ""You know, I like you, you aren't gay at all"". Without missing a beat he looked at my dad and said, ""It's easy to forget that l lick your son's asshole"". 

Everything got very still....and no one said anything for a minute and then my dad said, ""Like I was saying, no one could mistake you for straight"". 

"
That's inappropriate for a teacher to talk like that. I would report it
Wow. Move out. Leave. That's what I did when my controlling dad tried to make me his property. Stay strong.
He tells me he loves me whenever he thinks i've fallen asleep
Break it off. He did it before you found out and he'll do it again. I seen enough relationships to know that if one of them is caught cheating they will more than likely do it again. Sorry if i am being too straight forward.  
"The ability he has to sleep for 13 hours, wake up and then feel sleepy again after two hours. 

As much as I like not wasting time and being active, he's a hard worker and I can't help but find it adorable. 

Also he looks completely lost right after he wakes up and it takes him a while to realize where he is and what year it is. "
"That is what the Stonewall Rioters were fighting for. Please have a simple, wonderful, loving life. Don't apologize to our community for it. "

"Correct them.  Good smack upside the head with ""watch the teeth, bitch!"" usually does the trick.

Seriously, tell the guy how to suck your dick.  ""Woah, nice and slow now... yeah like that, yeaaah just like that babe, suck those balls, nice and gentle, yeah.  Tug it, a little faster.  Your mouth feels so good on my cock, use your tongue..."".  Positive reenforcement.  Pet him when he does it right.

Not only does it get you a better blowjob, most guys enjoy the dirty talk."

"He told me ""Oh he's just an old friend, he's got a girlfriend and a kid.  I had no idea he was on grindr looking for hookups"". This happened at 4am when I was at work... I got suspicious made a blank profile on grindr and spoofed my GPS location and found this guy at my house.  Turns out my ex had been cheating on me for at least a year with various guys. 

Or when I got back from a trip away and found all the condoms missing.

"My husband and I met in 2012 and got married in 2013. I knew I wanted to marry him after a couple of dates. We were privately engaged after 6 weeks and sat on the news for a few months to lessen the shock to our friends. He was the smartest, funniest, handsomest, kindest person I had ever encountered, and we were hyper-compatible with each other. He passed away suddenly last year, and that quick connection I had with him makes dating again difficult by comparison; if I go out with a guy a few times and I don't want to marry him, I bail rather than invest the time and energy into getting to know the person more. I imagine I'll get married again one day, but it probably won't be the result of an instantaneous connection like that. "

I would have a serious sit down talk with both your parents together, explain you are in college, you are about to be an adult, and you are past the age of them trying to control your sex life.  Tell him why, in calm clear terms, his response was totally inappropriate and also not at all grounded in law.   Then tell them that if they can't respect you as a sexually active adult, you will find a way to leave their house as soon as possible and that it could negatively change your relationship with them for a long time, perhaps permanently.   Mean it. 

You might also offer to go with them to a couple sessions of family counselling if they want an objective opinion (any real therapist would side with you on this one; we are not in gray territory).  If they don't change their tune, you gotta man up and gtfo.  Whatever support they are providing, it is not worth abuse and being treated like a 13 year old when you are in college.  "

It's time to NUT UP bro. You are the one who can help you now. Get you a roll of quarters, get you as much money as you can, wait for him to go to work or sleep and leave.

"Yeah.........But I was him. Kudos to you for being sweet to him while he was ***possibly*** in crisis or acting out in dangerous behaviors. 

I grew up in a very rough place. My story includes alcoholism, incest, sex abuse, ritual beatings, torture, and denial of food &amp; shelter. 

I am fifty now, and spent money and time on therapy to deal. It is totally difficult navigating being gay from that sort of sexual violation in your childhood. 

You were kind to him. Continue to be kind to him. He will end up opening up to you eventually. Guys like us with early sex abuse tend to be ***a lot more sexual*** than our peers. It may look quite like an addiction or a compulsion or even manipulation. From inside it is a way to get control by steering to a known, going to a place where we understand the outcome, using tangible assets to obtain a familiar outcome. For a guy who has been told to use his body to lessen his punishments this isn't strange.  

If he wants to spend more time together or life puts you two together it might be a good idea to inquire about him dealing with it and monitor whether or not to make a recommendation for counseling.    

Incest leaves a mark that will not be undone. It can be lessened with effort and counseling but it will never be ""okay"" or ""like it was before"". It can be dealt with and can become a source of self esteem, but before that happens years of work must be accomplished and he needs to be given control of his body and impulses. 

Thanks for being safe with him. It may have been ok to get busy, and a conversation may reveal that, but thanks anyhow for your honoring his worth and personhood. You go boy!"

Not being interested in you is not the same as looking down on you. Many of us are actually really nice everyday guys who just love to workout. 


&gt;Is it really necessary for all of us to aim to achieve that Adonis body?


No, you be you, no one is telling you to be someone you're not. The pressure that you're feeling is caused by male social pressure multiplied by how competitive and shallow the gay community is. You can have whatever body you want but it's common sense that guys will typically be more interested in guys with more fit/athletic body types. 

&gt;I'm guessing that any new guys that I would attract just because of a gym body would probably be pretty vapid anyway.


You'll just attract more people in general. Not everyone that is vapid because they are attracted to people with athletic bodies. 


&gt;is it really worth putting those extra hours at the gym when I could be with the people I love, going out to dinner and having a good time?


You can still do these things easily and still regularly workout. Lot's of us do it. Not to mention, the positive effects the gym has on your physical and mental health. It's worth the time for that alone.

1. He lied about his work situation and money. 


2. He had sex with another guy (blowjob) 


3. He planned to bring another guy home while you were working


4. He sent nudes to another guy


So there is zero chance he has been careful with your sexual health. It is (imho) likely that there were other sexual escapades that you are not aware of. There are a few things you can do about all of this. 

Go rent a storage unit, move out of his apartment. Seek a room for rent on Craigslist for the next few months, until you can save up enough to get your own place sorted. Talk to your job and let them know your primary relationship has just ended and ask for a placement somewhere else. Leave him and get tested. 

If you decide to stay remember this, he won't let you catch him the same way twice.

"I've dated women in the past but almost exclusively date men now for a number of reasons (a lot of these are subjective my *my* experiences; I don't expect every other person to relate entirely):

• The women I dated would become distraught if I went more than 48 hours without seeing them; I've yet to date a man who *wasn't* okay with spending several days apart. I love spending time with myself, and most men seem to respect this.
• I love writing cute love letters. Every woman I've dated would swoon over these and reciprocate, which I loved. I've yet to date a man who liked writing me letters.
• Sex with men is better. I like to be more submissive in bed, and men are much more willing to take on the dominant role than women.
• The men I've dated don't cry. Probably just my bad luck, but I've yet to have a boyfriend who felt comfortable crying outside of the rare occasion. The women I dated cried at least once a month. As someone who enjoys the emotional relief of crying, that's been hard to deal with. 
• Men break up with me; women don't. I ended each relationship with a woman, but the man would be the one to end each of my relationships with them.
• The biggest one for me: **I've NEVER felt pressured to get married to a man.** I don't want to get married, and boy, is it a relief to be with someone else who doesn't interpret that as me not loving them.

Again, these experiences are likely subjective, but they have been common threads throughout my relationships."

This is pretty normal that one partner feels it was the beginning of something special and the other one feels it was ""just a fuck"" with no deeper connection.  

Should you feel used?   It doesn't matter.   You feel used.   However, you should also know that he doesn't feel like using you was any wrong thing.  To him, it was just a recreational thing to do.  He might be surprised to learn that it might imply something deeper."

"At first it was a tough call.

We were totally against hyphenating as it would be too long and make things confusing for future kids and if they got married.

I liked my last name and he liked his, though is last name is dorky as all hell.

But... my family made it easy for me by shunning me or refusing to come to the wedding (most of them anyways). Meanwhile his family was wholly supportive, despite being die-hard Catholics.

So if my family didn't want anything to do with me, I didn't want anything to do with their name. So, I took his.

"Well said dude.  That really describes topping or basically just the ""male"" experience of fucking.  Apart from how fucking amazing it feels to have your penis inside someone... one of the best parts is that male instinct to thrust and buck your hips in that rhythmic motion.  Once you get into that rhythm... your hips just seem to move on their own.  It just feels so... male.  That's an awesome feeling... and it's something I think only another guy can understand.

The other awesome part that you didn't mention is that feeling of complete vulnerability when you're cumming inside someone.  On one hand like you said... you're violating, owning, him.  Planting your seed in him (or her).  But on the other hand... that moment when you lose control of your body while you're literally INSIDE someone else can make you feel really vulnerable... in a good way."

"First off, glad you're okay and haven't done anything irreversible. Based on all the violence you've mentioned in this post, I'd file a police report as I understand the parental aspect in teaching kids right from wrong, but this was overly excessive. There's also nothing wrong with being gay and should your family choose not to accept you, their loss. 

&amp;nbsp;

Despite your parents now searching for you a new place, see if you can stay with a friend. I would completely disconnect myself from them as much as possible. While there may be an option for recourse later, I would definitely let their emotions settle.  IMO, I don't think that guy would ever come back. If you have any of his clothes send him a message on Facebook with an apology and see if he wants them back. Might be scarred."

I snapped my head up, and she and I locked eyes for a split-second before she pulled the door closed. "

"I think you'll find a hell of a lot of straight people come from similar homes...I doubt that caused them to be straight.

I was forced into an anti-gay camp aged 15, and do you know one of the things they told me? They said that I ""envied"" or ""lusted after"" males because my dad died when I was 9. It's sickening, disrespectful bullshit and nothing more than that."
"This times a million. I feel like as gay guys, this is our superpower, and we don't give it enough credit for how awesome it is. Back in 2006, I gave a talk to a friend's human sexuality class. It was a night class filled with older people who were trying to get a degree in psychology, and she wanted someone to come in and give her class some first-hand insight, because there were literally no out gay people in her class. She had briefed her class on what NOT to ask a gay guy, and how to be respectful to a guest speaker. She let me know this, and asked nicely, so I agreed.

Here was a group of adults in their late 30s and early 40s, who had never met a gay guy in a long term relationship before. They'd seen gay guys on TV, and movies. They'd done readings from gay guys. But, they'd never had a chance to have a conversation. 

It was a 3 hour class, and the teacher told me I could have as long as I wanted. I told the class about how I'd met my mate at the time, and how we negotiated our relationship with each other and the world. I told them a little bit about my coming out, but didn't spend too much time on it, because that wasn't the focus of the talk.

Then, I asked if anyone had any questions. This was such a fascinating time for me. After answering the ""simple"" questions, like ""How do your respective parents react to your relationship,"" and ""are either of you still religious"" and such, I figured that we'd built up enough trust that I could loosen up the reigns. 

I told them that the teacher told them how to ask ""respectable"" questions, and that was OK for someone who hadn't been navigating the gay world for as long as I'd been. I told them that as long as they asked with a genuine curiosity and not a judging manner, I'd be happy to answer any ""hot button"" type questions. 

This was where things got real, but also where I started to realise that the gender clash bullshit was exactly that.

""Who cooks?"" This one was very interesting, because you had about a 70%-30% ratio of women to men. ""I cook, because I enjoy it, and I'm good at it.""

""And the cleaning?"" Again, it was back to the domestic stuff. ""He does the dishes, because I cook. It's an arrangement that works, because we talked about it and came to that agreement.""

Some of these folks had been divorced. ""So if you all divorce, how do things work out?"" I was newly married, so this one was kind of an odd question for me, but sure as shit, we'd talked about it. ""If it comes to that, we'll divide up our stuff to the person who uses/needs that thing more, and split the savings in half. That way, both of us can find a new place to live, and set ourselves up."" Ten years later, when we did divorce, that's exactly how things played out. 

By the end of the talk, the people in the class were like, ""Wait, so y'all have a more evolved relationship than the old school hetero ones we're in."" I explained that they too have that option, but they don't choose to use it, because there are so many gendered assumptions about marriage and relationships. I was quick to remind them that even though our marriage was a peculiarly good one, that a lot of it came from the fact that we had to negotiate pretty damn near everything. 

That's when I got out of the funk of, ""Woe is me I'm gay,"" and turned it into ""Being gay is my superpower"". "

"Conservatism is an ideology. The Republican party is not conservative. They may have some conservative policies, but most are centre and aren't that different from the democratic party. The current Republican party doesn't represent the right or the left very well. This is the nature of modern day parties. Congress is a complete gridlock and you can't pass anything through. Everything just ends up in the middle. 

Also if you think being conservative is inherently homophobic then you don't understand the ideology well enough. At it's core conservative means private ownership, being left alone and rational economics. They don't support conversion therapy. At most a conservative would support an individual who wants to do conversion therapy of their own choices and would be against the state having any part in conversion therapy. 

If you want to look at discussions from actual conservatives I suggest you start following http://www.dailywire.com/ and check out their podcasts.

"An hour of sex just isn't worth a lifetime of taking more pills than I already do on a daily basis. It's not worth having to tell every guy I get with that I have HIV.

I have a lot of self-esteem and self-worth issues, but even I respect myself enough to do everything in my power to avoid contracting HIV."
"I get to spend all my time with, have sex with, and enjoy men. I've fallen for boys since I was a little boy. I like the way they look, act, smell, just everything. For me the sex is a bonus that makes being into men even more wonderful.

WRONG. 

You can still drastically improve by changing your behavior, regardless of your genes. 

&gt; Saying that all big guys are out of shape and can magically become smaller if they just tried a little harder is ludicrous.

A little harder? It's hard work. But so are many other aspects of life. It's not ludicrous. They can get smaller, but choose not to. That's fine, and they have the right to live the lifestyle they choose. But I don't want to hear them whining about being discriminated against for things wrong with them that are within their control.

"&gt;Don't people understand the risk involved or are these just selfish tops thinking ""I'm not bottoming, don't matter to me"".

These guys understand the risks and have decided that the extra pleasure and turn-on of raw sex is worth it. They told you up front that they do not like condoms, giving you an opportunity to make sexual health decisions outside the heat of the sexual moment.

You decided that you aren't comfortable taking those risks, so you said ""no"" and they respected that. Nobody is forcing you to fuck these guys.

"/u/igua321 The thread I think you're referring to, first off the guy called himself shallow (it was even in his username), secondly, he didn't refuse to date an overweight person - he was thinking about breaking up with his boyfriend in his long term relationship solely based on him gaining weight. He didn't even think about talking it through with him or supporting him in losing weight or getting to the bottom of why he was gaining weight in the first place. His immediate reaction to his boyfriend gaining weight was - ""how do I break up with him?"" - and that is more than shallow."
"I'm on a long car drive so get ready for an in-depth story.

Senior year of high school, I had my first relationship with a guy. We kept it secret (well, until this night) because neither of us were out. He lived with his parents, cuz high school. Our parents thought we were just really close friends, since we spent so much time together and we were just two average-acting teens.

So its a weeknight and he had texted me at around 10:30 to come over. I was out with friends, and I decided I'd just head over before coming home for the night. I get to his house, and he sneaks me through the garage to his room. We're just cuddling, watching Netflix. But soon we get nakey and are making out. I get under the blanket, go down on him, but I throw it off quickly in a hot sweat. So I'm deep-throating him, my back to the door and him opposite, when the door opens and his cat walks in. First the door swings halfway open, but someone shuts it after what I assume seeing what was going on. We immediately throw the covers back on and he starts panicking. We talk about what to tell our new witness and cuddle a bit to kill time before he lets me out.

I don't know why, but when he lets me out I take lead. I walk down the hallway and into the kitchen, where the door to the garage is.  But sitting there, wide-eyed on the couch, is his mother. ""Hi u/acceptablecondition!"" She said in surprise. I will never forget the collective look on our faces at that moment! I tried to play off the situation by asking her how her night is etc. and my boyfriend leads me out the door. Next day my mom gets a call from his mom, and the most awkward joint dinner was had the day after."
"You do have a choice to either just roll over or else push back in a mature way and set boundaries with your parents.  Have a serious, respectful conversation with both your parents explaining why this is ridiculous and why it is not appropriate to treat you like a kid when you are in college and almost 18.  Then offer, as a sign of maturity, to go to a family counselor to get an unbiased opinion on whether your parents are treating their college age child in a healthy manner by refusing to allow him to date or have a sex life as a condition of their support.  If they refuse to budge or see a counselor, then leave.  If that means getting an extra job, so be it.  If it means crashing on a couch, OK.  If it means going to a sympathetic family member for a loan, OK.   Even if it means dropping out of college for a semester or reducing your course load while you save up, do it.  Whatever material support they are providing you, it's not worth sacrificing your dignity and your sex life.   Choose to man up, reject the way they are treating you, and deal with the consequences.  You are not 14 anymore, you have options.  "

It's called GDDS - Gay Drama Deficiency Syndrome. During anti climactic situations gays often experience feelings of loss and disappointment at the lack of drama or stress. This leads to many gays deliberately creating high stakes situations out of otherwise petty dramas. Having a non dramatic coming out like you have is one of the biggest risk factors for GDDS so make sure you get yourself checked. 
"Oh. So I'm not crazy? So my husband, soon to be ex-husband, had been on Grindr for the last YEAR and I found out by spoofing my location and making a blank Grindr profile and putting it at my house when I wasn't there, both on overnights and just other random times when I was out running errands, etc.

Never found my husband's profile but found other guys' profiles ""0 feet away"" from my house. Busted him twice. Now we're divorcing. First time I busted him I agreed to try to work on things. That was a year ago. Busted him again in March, and we've been separated since.

He had the nerve to take a domestic violence protective order out against me, alleging false things, and I've had to defend myself in court. He has said in court that I'm ""crazy"" for spoofing my location and using a blank profile to bust his cheating.

But knowing others have done this is pretty damn validating for me."
"The year was 2002, cell phones were crazy expensive and rare. I had a gay friend (both of us in the closet) over and my best friend (straight) with his girlfriend. The night is winding down, me gay friend and I head back to my room (I had a sleeper sofa in my room, longer story) to turn in for the night.

After watching TV for about 20 minutes it quieted down in the front of the house, we figured they were getting theirs time for us to get ours. Well a different friend of mine decided to call to let me know that he would be later than expected to pick me up for a game of paint ball in the morning.

Best friend answers the phone, and decided to come to my room to give me the phone. Of course he has no idea what's going on so he just throws the door open, to see me on my knees spitting a 10"" dick out of my mouth as dude shoots his load all over my chest.

""Oh my God!!! Dude, He(me) can't talk right now, he's, he's got his mouth full! Bye! Hung up the phone and ran back to the front of the house.

I'd never been caught before. Or since, till this past June. I'm vacationing back home, staying at my mom's in my childhood bedroom with my ex. It's been a VERY busy trip, we had barely had time to kiss let alone fool around. So I'm blowing my ex on top on the covers with the door closed when SAME FRIEND comes by to hang out.. Did he learn from the past? NOPE! 

He busted open the door and let's out a ""Oh my God!"" As he catches an eye full of me spitting yet another dick out of my mouth. My reaction? ""Dude, do you just want to see me sucking cock or something?""

So there it is, the only 2 times I've been caught having sex."
"We both have the same name which isnt that exciting but on our first date we discovered: We werre wearing the same shoes, we have very close birthdays and our mothers also have the same names..

"I don't get why people saying that this isn't something to ruin a career over. If a student feels uncomfortable or targeted in any way they should report it. School is supposed to be a safe environment for students, not one where they feel they are being attacked. Also, it's not a guarantee the teacher will be fired... you're all acting like that reporting this incident will end his life. If it's the first time he's been reported for inappropriate comments, the principal will probably just give him a slap on the wrist with the promise of a bigger consequence next time. If it's not the first time then it's a damn good thing he was reported and then more drastic consequences will follow, like getting fired or suspended (not sure if teachers get suspended or what the term is). He made a dumb comment so students should feel free to report it if they felt uncomfortable. "

"Reading the first half of this post, it sounded like the parents are just old fashioned in expecting a more feminine role for their son's partner. But then in the last half, you described yourself as being exactly that.

You don't like fishing, camping, and sports, so then why are you upset that you aren't being invited along for those activities. Your fiancé and his dad probably know that it's really not your thing just as you said, which is fine.

If you don't want to take their family name then speak up and say so. If you behave submissively then don't be surprised when people treat you that way."
