"Carrie and Big. They went back and forth for like 6 years, and he leaves her at the altar. Their relationship was toxic af. "
Ross and Rachel. They were actually written to be kinda dysfunctional but GOD THEY SHOULD'VE NEVER GOTTEN BACK TOGETHER 
"How frequently he'd be interrupted.

How little he'd be respected by professional colleagues.

How many men would be creepy.

How having ""an easier time getting sex"" actually just means ""having more people willing to fuck you regardless of your interest in them.""

That getting asked every time he's in a bad mood if it's because of his period gets really fucking old."
"I went to a board game cafe with a first date. I mean technically there was coffee there, but we played games while we chatted. It took some of the awkwardness away because during small silences we would focus on the games . "
How difficult it is to orgasm during penetrative sex. 
"We have been together for 20 years.  Been together since high school. 

1. Realize no relationship or person is perfect.   Acknowledge your spouse's strengths, even when you are upset with them.

2. Have good communication if you have issues be open to counseling if needed.  We haven't gone to counseling but we are both open to that option if we need to.  

3. Have your own hobbies and your own friend groups. 

4.  Trust one another. I trust him completely.


5.   Be honest and be free to admit when you are wrong. 

6. Always make time for your spouse.  If you have enough time to brush your teeth or watch GoT you have enough time to give your husband a back rub or to sit and have lunch with your wife.  We have two kids and two dogs and a we both work full time, but we always make time for one another.


I can't imagine life without him."
"You know those bits of tissue/clot that ooze out during your period? I had an nice big one plop out while I was showering. I decided I just had to pick it up and squish it. It was gross, but kinda fascinating. 

I live alone, thank god."
"people who can't own their shit. it's always someone else's fault, they'll deflect and blame and gaslight until they're blue in the face ages before they admit that they fucked up and were wrong.

the sad thing is, people actually respond so much better to humility (''i was wrong'') than they ever could with a bullshit-a-thon."
Bella &amp; Edward. Edward was controlling AF. 
How 1/4 of his year will be spent bleeding. That doesn't even include the pre-period pains. It's honestly astounding the 1 week out of a month is dealing with that bullshit. 
"I'd advise you call up the jail you're going to and find out some information ahead of time. Also, see if they post anything on their website.

Ask about the following:

* Ask about bringing in your own thermals, shirts, and underwear/bras. If they don't allow it, then ask what the prices are on canteen.

* If you wear glasses, ask if the glasses you wear are allowed inside. Depending on the make of your glasses, they may not be allowed.

* You're going to be bored in there. Ask about books. They'll definitely have a library, but you may be allowed to have someone send you new books from Amazon.

* If you're sentenced to 30 days or more and are able to work, ask about becoming trustee (basically, an inmate worker that does either laundry, kitchen, cleaning, etc). You'll be able to work (help with boredom), and you'll probably get benefits from working as a trustee. 

* Ask about inmate programs! They may have GED, religious, or substance abuse programs that you can participate in.

* Other things to consider while you're in there: prices of phone calls, policy on mail, and visitation schedules."
Every shrill nagging wife and dumb fat everyman sitcom couple ever.
How difficult it is to get men to take you seriously. 
"The sanctity of conveying your spare tampon to a woman in need, be she friend or foe."
"Hermione and Ron.

I feel like they are a prime example of why 'love should not conquer all'.

You don't have to marry some dude just because he's been pestering you all through grammar school, because circumstances outside your control brought you together, because 'it would look good for the press'.

Ron should have found someone that wanted to have a pile of kids and follow him around while he rocked it on the quidditch pitch.

Hermione should have gotten someone that intellectually stimulated her and was more thoughtful."
"I didn't even know his country existed. We met online. 

Now I've been there. 

It totally exists.  "
Can't believe no one has said Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. Such a toxic relationship. 
"Yep. My ex made me watch friends and I was like 

""Why doesn't Rachel date Joey? They are way better suited to each other and Joey is a better guy anyways""


He would get butthurt and complain that Joey was a prick who slept with too many women and was too dumb.


Ok, but Ross is an egotistical, condescending idiot with both a victim complex and serious problems regarding women. Just because you relate to him better doesn't mean they would be good together "
"Sewer line broke in the backyard...waded in a shit river to find the break. Husband tried to make me feel better by saying ""At least it's our poop, babe!"" That did not make anything better."
"Women who post inspirational shit on the internet but are still complete assholes to others in person. 
"
"Rory Gilmore and ... well, all three of the boyfriends.

"Here's a story from a man about it.  He accidentally signed off his emails using his female colleague's signature and was confused at the way clients were responding to him.  They were being dismissive and difficult to work with.  He realized he was using her signature.  So he switched names with her for a week and had her sign off with his name as an experiment.  She had the most productive week ever.

"Most of the high school age girls basically live to find a man and then be a house wife and have kids. Their college plans are generally, go to BYU long enough to meet a good Mormon man, then drop out and be a house wife and have as many kids as possible. 
It's a culture where men are the center of everything. Women are subservient and domestic. And being successful as a woman means marrying the best possible guy and having lots of children. 
So when bella tosses aside her friends and family to follow Edward every where, and completely abandons her own life and plans to be with him no matter what, and gives her life (basically) to marry and have his baby...it's very much like what Mormon girls do. They leave school, and/or jobs, they leave friends and family if those people aren't in good standing with the church or her husbands family, they go where he goes without question or, often input. They have no real plans our dreams for themselves. It's all about him. "
The Joker and Harley Quinn. Fuck no. Such an unhealthy relationship.
"When we first started dating I was at a point in my life where I was having fun going out and meeting new people, but also ready to settle down if the right person came along. I was busy settling into my (very new to me) career and he was working a dead end job and didn't have a lot of direction, I didn't see a future because he just wasn't what I pictured, different life stages you could say.

But he made me laugh, and he made me feel beautiful and like the only girl in the entire world. Like the quote from the dad in Juno, something along the lines of find someone who thinks the sun shines out of your ass. I've been with enough men to know that's not something that just comes along, and before I knew it weeks turned to months and before long he barely ever left my apartment. I couldn't really tell you when he moved in, he just never left one day and I was ok with it (which as a super private, need my space person, is huge). I was still apprehensive, I had my vision and he didn't check every box, but I was completely enamored at this point. 

And then I realized my vision can change, and it did, because I can't imagine doing life without him now. He carries the household even though I pay most of the bills. I have always been miss independent and I couldn't do it without him now, or at least I certainly don't want to. He's in school now, he got a better job and another part time gig coaching a school sport that he loves. And he spends every day loving me and our little dog and making sure I'm taken care of. He's catching up life stage wise, he just needed a glimpse of what his life could be like and it kicked him into gear. 

He's planning to propose soon and I can't wait to marry the scruffy goofball who took me to the mall food court and a music store on our first date (after giving me a rose, so cute lol). "
"How having random people hit on, catcall, or sexually assault you really isn't fun, even if the person would typically be considered attractive. I don't know why, but some men seem to think they would just love it if a random woman came up and groped their balls and told them all the horrible shit they want to do to them. Not so fun when it really happens. "
"For someone who grew up around Mormons it was super obvious that it was written by a Mormon. Twilight is like Mormon romance.
Not trying to hate one mormons. I've got no issues with them, but twilight totally reminded me of the Mormon girls I went to school with. "
"I met and began dating my husband in our senior year of high school. We were eachother's first everything, first kiss, relationship, etc. Our story is probably unusual in that we were not religious and waited 12 years to get married, living together starting at 19. We did a little long distance in college and much later due to him being on field assignments for work. We have never broken up or taken a break. We have been monogamous and faithful the whole time.

I don't really have much frame of reference to tell you how it's different from the norm. We have no exes, so there can be no drama or jealousy relating to past partners. We were eachother's first loves, so our love has been whole-hearted and unrestrained, as neither of us know romantic heartbreak. We also grew into adults together, and we know the other so intimately that communication is nearly effortless. We have struggled together and nothing has broken us. We have experienced growth, change, and adversity together, and our dedication to our relationship has never wavered.

I'm married to my best friend, my first and only love, the person who knows me and understands me best. It's pretty awesome."
Hating on things that teenage girls like because teenage girls like it. Leave them alone. Not everything needs to be deep and esoteric to have value.
"Entrepreneur/mindfulness culture and influencer blogs. Everything interesting in internet is ridden with them and their trivial but cute spoken language of ""follow your dreams"".

Oh, and wanderlust blogs too, with chicks propagating ""give up your job and live life"" while meticulously taking seemingly effortless pictures with DSLR cameras of herself in meticulously chosen messy bun hairdo and dress over some canal in Viet Nam."
"My boyfriend and I were out of town Sunday and out &amp; about and I went to the bathroom to change my tampon. When I pulled it out, there was the largest blood clot I'd ever seen on it...it was about the size of, idk, a chicken nugget or something. Gross right? Well, I wanted my bf to see it so instead of throwing it away....I...wrapped it in like 10 layers of toilet paper and put it in my purse. Later on back at the hotel, I asked my bf if he wanted to see something really gross and he excitedly said yes. I got it out of my purse and showed him, then I watched the color leave his face as he asked me to get it as far away from him as I could. He wasn't readdddyyyyyyyy. "
"I have wonderful handwriting, and have done invites for weddings before. Not the best money, but I enjoy it and love compliments on my writing!

Also, babysitting. $15-$20/ hour to eat snacks and play games?! Yes please. And I am good at it, enjoy it, and still feel like a giddy teenager when the parents come home tipsy and overpay me

I also walk the neighbor's dog at lunch. And my elderly neighbor gives me treats and baked goods to carpool with her  to the food store and unload her groceries, so that's fun. I'll always be someone that has a side hustle, even if I don't need the money because I'm nosy and like the feeling of community, mainly

E: phrase"
"Plus Joey seemed like he'd be able to commit if he actually wanted to. Cheating was Ross's thing, and commitment issues was Chandler's thing. Joey just liked to play the field - but there wasn't really anything indicating he *couldn't* commit."
"How much time, effort, and money it takes to look good, and how much your looks affect the way people treat you. "
"I was way too young when I tried to read Little Women, and even though it kept saying ""he,"" I totally had Laurie as a girl. The gendered name must have developed in my head before a firm understanding of pronouns, so for me, Little Women was my first lesbian romance. 
"
"Make noises at each other.  Like, it might start as an actual conversation and just devolve into going ""meeerrrrhhhh"" back and forth.

Example:

""Hey, what you doin?""

""Meh""

""Muuuugggghhhh""

""Bleh""

""Bleeeeeggghhhh""

And so on until we get tired of it."
"""You're so smart and white on the inside, but so hot and brown on the outside.""

"I wish she understood that I'm not an extension of her. That my decisions and my life, and eventually the decisions of my child and their life are not hers. And aren't a do over for her own life. I wish she understood the damage she caused. 


I'm way closer to my grandma who understands the subtle pleasures of being judgey in the driver seat and that quality tequila is always worth paying for and that she'd prefer (and has no problem saying it ) that all her grandchildren know how to make a good mix drink and how to properly cut down a tree. "
"Have your own separate lives. When you're madly in love it can be easy to spend all your time with your partner and let things fall by the wayside. Years down the road you'll uncover resentment that had slowly been building that you weren't even conscious of. 

Keep up with your own hobbies and make time for your own friends. You need to be two complete individuals, not two halves. Besides fulfilling your own dreams, it gives you something to share and talk about with your SO - if you do everything together you have nothing to tell. "
"That everyone should have ready and informed access to a variety of safe, reliable, and manageable contraceptive methods. "
"Picnic! Most cities have some nature or a cool park you can hang out at with some sandwiches. 

It also can be fun to do a super touristy thing in your city, like a food tour or ghost tour. Then you have something interesting to talk about.  "
"Forever weirded out by Amy &amp; Laurie ending up together in *Little Women*. First because Amy sucks, but also because Laurie was still so clearly on the rebound from Jo and I feel like he mostly married her so he could be part of the March family."
Ray Ramone and Debrah. They were so disrespectful to each other. 
"Fucking Lily and Marshall on HIMYM... 

I'm not sure I agree with everyone who hates on Lily - but they are both basically afraid of leaving the relationship because they are so embedded in each others lives. The show makes it seem like it should be sweet, and that they just love each other so much they work through all their issues. But each of their solutions just screams ""I'm afraid to be alone and am just settling for good enough so that I don't have to learn how to be my own person!"" "
"Not wanting kids. The earth has over 7 billion people. Is it really so wrong to not want to contribute to that?

(I do want kids, but I have a lot of empathy for my dear friends who want to remain childfree.)"
"I'm going to get downvoted to fuck for this, but hear me out: Jim and Pam.

I was very much on board with Jim and Pam for a very long time, until Jim got the job opportunity in Philly. It was a chance to do exactly what he wanted, as well as to leave Dunder Mifflin behind. But Pam shot him down--IIRC, on the grounds that she ""likes their life"" in Scranton and doesn't want to be far away from her mother. 

Scranton is 2 hours from Philadelphia--it's not even an interstate move. Pam was being asked to make, at best, a moderate sacrifice--and she refused. The degree to which Jim is bored and hates his job is one of the long-running themes of the show, and when he finally had an opportunity for something much better, Pam wouldn't budge. Clearly, every couple goes through stuff like this, but the way Pam wouldn't even try to compromise with Jim on this has always bothered me.

That being said, Jim's proposal and the wedding episode will never fail to warm my cold, dead heart. "
Ugh. I feel like almost all 90s/early 2000s sitcom couples were horrible. I hate the stupid husband/naggy wife trope.
"I'm going physical:

1. How cramps aren't just situated in the abdomen.

2. How stairs + breasts = disaster

3. Underboob sweat is real"
"Yeah, a lot of men don't understand that we have an ""easier time getting sex"" from men who don't give a shit if we orgasm and will throw us away like trash when they're done with us. Not to mention the overall safety risks that come with having casual sex. It seems like a lot of men don't understand why many women don't actually like the fact that a lot of men see us as fuckholes and nothing else. Not being able to get sex sucks, but being seen as good for nothing but sex sucks too. "
I cried because a kitten on my Instagram feed was extremely small.
"We were discussing books and I'd recently read Lolita. He took it as his cue to talk about how he thought many girl children try to seduce older men and how specifically he interpreted his friend's 3-4 year old daughter wanting to sit on his lap as her ""flirting"" with him."
"Yep. Joeys biggest flaw was that he was a little dumb. He seemed genuinely sweet and was my favourite guy on that show. No malice, no problems with women, no problems with anyone really unless they hurt his friends. Just a happy guy "
I never want children. 
"Understand that the ""In love"" feeling comes and goes.

Sometimes it is important to be committed to the Relationship because your feelings for the person can change at times, life stressors change.

"Difficult? Try impossible (for me, anyways)."
Well I wouldn't have signed a lease with him a couple months before. 
"For what it's worth. JK Rowling actually agrees.

""I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron. I know, I'm sorry, I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility. 

Am I breaking people's hearts by saying this? I hope not."""
"Meredith and Derek on Grey's Anatomy. They're written as a fated love that is greater than other loves but: they refused to communicate with each other, punished the other whenever they felt the other did something wrong, made life altering decisions without even consulting each other, etc. "
"I think the ""mental"" turn ons that come with sex. If I don't get to talk about sex, or actively participate in flirtatious or sexual activity before taking my clothes off, I don't even really think about it at all. A lot of guys know foreplay is important, but I don't think they realize how much flirting and shooting a dirty text can go a long way."
"Fuckin Zuko and Mai. Mai was such a random choice and Zuko was such a phenomenal, important character. Wtf."
Sometimes I ask him to 'pancake' me which means he lies on top of me and kind of squashes me down. Idk it feels comforting? I swear it's not a fetish...
"Well that and the waiting to have sex until marriage which essentially means getting married *directly* out of high school. 

I always loved how extremely lame Bella was though. So ""irresistible"" to Edward, everyone always acting like she was so much smarter and more mature than her schoolmates. Girl, you fuckin boring as shit, you don't do anything but moon over a patronizing asshole, and you got married straight outta high school and then dropped off the face of the earth to have a kid immediately, and your only friends are your husband's siblings. Your life is sad and not romantic."
"A positive note: the power of great female friendships. I have a really wonderful close lady friend and my fiancé comments all the time about how cool our friendship is. I asked if he had any friends he would consider the same way and he said no, but that his relationship with me is very similar to my (platonic) relationship with my lady friend. It makes me sad that men generally miss out on the closeness and support and vulnerability that can be had in really great friendships *except* when it comes to their SO."
"Misread the title as ""I'm *that* cow"" and it made me put down my bag of pretzels.

I guess I can continue now."
"It is pretty nice overall. I was never much into dating around or the hookup culture and was a bit cynical about relationships because my family is so dysfunctional. I spent my 20s alone and traveling and enjoying my time, met my husband at 28, got married at 32, almost 35 now. 

Every now and then I wish I'd had sex with other men besides my husband before we met, but sex is very vulnerable and intimate to me so I feel like I spared myself a lot of heartbreak and sorrow. Plus, all the time alone before he and I met made me strong and independent and helped me love and accept myself on my own. "
"""Well, goodness! I don't usually do this with someone I've only just met!""

*tee hee hee* 

*blowjob* "
"They overestimate my intelligence. I'm really not that bright. I just watch a lot of documentaries and full of useless information. 



I don't think anyone underestimates anything about me."
"That if she didn't respond with harsh judgment or shaming every time I reveal even remotely personal information to her, I would be comfortable with a much closer relationship than we have now. The problem isn't me being distant or a ""private person."" The problem is that I don't feel safe letting her really get to know me, because I end up getting hurt every time I try."
"It's going to kind of depend on where you live. Like in my city the zoo is free and nice. So is the botanical gardens. There's also an arboretum, many museums, lakeside terraces. Tons of free outdoor concerts of different dtules throughout the summer. Neighborhood festivals. Food cart nights. With fall coming there are corn mazes, apple picking, petting zoos, pumpkin patches. "
"Escorting. Well, at this point I don't know if escorting is my side hustle or actually my main job."
"I would have liked not to be raised in a bubble by helicopter parents.  My mom has recently apologized for making me think that everything is ""scary"" as a kid. Couldn't ride bike alone, go to the park alone, go to sleepovers, etc. I was a very lonely, anxious child. "
"Him: What would you say if I told you a man should be the one in charge in a relationship?

Me: Bye.

He tried to laugh it off, but I was done. Finished my appetizer,     paid and left. Glad he showed his backwards ass attitude quickly."
"Stupid armchair comments about hurricane Harvey like ""lol they're stupid why didn't they evacuate and empty their reservoirs before the storm."" People love making comments about situations they have no fucking experience or insight on and it's infuriating. "
"Staying in an abusive relationship. Also, completely sacrificing your friendships for a relationship, which goes hand-in-hand with abuse a lot of the time.

Staying with a cheater and trying to work it out.

Becoming FWBs with someone you still have feelings for.

Quitting a hobby or passion you truly enjoy, especially if the reason for quitting is because your dead end job sucks the life out of you and leaves no energy for other things."
"Flaky people.

Moved to a new city earlier this year and was excited to meet up with a girl I've known online for years but never met in person. We got together and hit it off immediately and had a lovely night. 

In the 4 months since, I've only seen her one other time. I'm always the one bugging her to hang out, and every time I suggest a get-together, she winds up cancelling on me at the last minute. The final straw was my birthday party, which I invited her to a month in advance only to have her cancel 3 days prior to go to a wedding that she *definitely* knew about already when I first invited her to the party.

I'm tired of chasing my friends down to have them flake. We're in our thirties, folks, learn to make a plan. "
"For every guy like you, there's one who loudly proclaims that he wants a girl who ""doesn't put all that shit on her face"" and thinks that spending 20 minutes on makeup is proof that girls are stupid and self-obsessed. Those are the same guys who will point to a girl wearing a 35-product ""natural"" makeup look and say ""see? she doesn't need all that shit to look good."" There are *plenty* of guys who have no idea what it takes for some women to look presentable. Sometimes when I'm drawing my eyebrow on for the fifth time that morning I cheer myself up by imagining how confused and horrified they would be if all women suddenly stopped wearing makeup for a week. "
I really wish board game cafes would start to pop up on every corner. 
"I don't get why they even wanted to get married at all. The only time they were good together was when they were FWBs. They really did have great chemistry, they ""got"" each other, and cared about each other, but neither of them was mature and responsible enough for marriage."
"And then Katara and Aang. She treated him like a child. Every kissing scene between them was creepy and uncomfortable. 

Katara and Zuko had the fury and passion. There's a reason that's such a popular ship. "
has anyone said Period Poops yet?
"Learn to separate your value as a person from your ability to do x or y. 

You can be a phenomenal, valuable person, worthy of love and respect, even if you're terrible at cooking, even if you make mistakes sometimes. Everyone makes mistakes, does things wrong, has to learn, and is better at some things than others. That doesn't mean they're worth less as people, that they're bad people, that they, in themselves, are failures. 

You could be (like me) a failure *at cross-country skiing,* for example - but that does not make you a failure *as a person.* 

This doesn't help as much if people criticize your actual character, but thinking like this does help me a lot with performance anxiety and hearing criticism about things I'm doing. "
Regular exercise.
I've been watching FRIENDS on Netflix and absolutely nothing about them works. 
"My boyfriend and I give social commentary in the voices of 70-year-old characters named Enis and Ethel. They live on a farm in the Midwest sometime in the post-scarcity future and have children that don't explain the internet to them. 

""Alex sent me one of them memes today.""
""Let me see it. Is that Evil Morty? I remember when he was a kid. Good kid. Then he got into that Satan-worshippin' robotics club and it just weren't the same.""
""Hush, your pacemaker is robotic.""

And on and on until we devolve into ridiculous laughter. "
"Talked about how overpaid teachers are and how homeschooling is the way most people should be educated.

I was a teacher at the time."
I always play as princess peach
"Ivanka Trump. She has the power, money and influence to change the world, but her book proved to all that she isn't even aware of issues that effect women who aren't wealthy.  And I honestly hoped she might help Americans afford daycare, but then she just doesn't know how to help people below her income bracket and she isn't interested in learning anything. 

There are tons of bad feminists but the sheer wasted potential here is what gets me. "
"I mean, is there any indication they don't make each other happy, though? Not everyone wants to date someone who is exactly like them, Ron barely plays quidditch anyway. "
"I'm not a fan of the current liberal feminist trend where anything and everything a woman does is supposedly feminist and non-problematic as long as a woman says she chooses it.

Other than that, I'd consider terrible feminists people who are hypocrites, who espouse equality but don't carry it out in their private lives and act out roles or support institutions or ideas that are fundamentally unequal."
"&gt; some men seem to think they would just love it if a random woman came up and groped their balls 

Had this happen twice. Once was a quick feel in a crowd and she quickly walked away, the other was a drunk girl who plastered herself to me, started saying things like ""I wanna fuck you on the hood"" (I was filling up my car at a gas station next to a bar) while feeling me up. Her friends peeled her off of me and apologized.

You're right, it wasn't fun. It was just creepy and weird. And even though I was a lot bigger than both of them, I can definitely see how it could be scary if that person was potentially capable of overpowering me"
The people who romanticize them make me sad.

"Disagree. I think Season 7 Logan was an excellent match once he got his shit together.

"Right! And Rachel, bless her, wasn't that book-smart (I know *Ross* thinks she's straight up dumb, but you don't get as high in your chosen career path in like ten years as she did if you're dumb) herself, so I don't think the fact that Joey isn't the brightest spark would bother her.

I do think being condescended to constantly the way Ross does would bother her."
"On a first date: ""You know, if things work out between us, you're going to have to get rid of your pets."" 

Got rid of him instead. "
"When one of us is doing something, the other will frequently ""lion king"" one of our pets in the other's face, just to be distracting. This comes complete with a totally butchered rendition of ""naaaa lasagnaaaa, or maybe a pizzaaaa"". 

This started one night when my SO was drunk and singing as many Disney songs as he knew/could make up the lyrics to. Now it's basically a daily thing. "
"I'm mentally ill.

"I only spent three days in jail.  My cellmate was a prostitute who was super nice and easy to be around,  so that made it easier.  Other than that,  it was just massively boring.  The food was inedible and there was no place comfortable to sit or lie down. It sucked.   "
"Tbh, all of the relationships were so bad on that show. Ted and Robin should not have gotten together in the end. It makes sense Robin and Barney got divorced, but Ted and ""The Mother"" were the ONLY healthy relationship in that show.

I have a friend who had an ex that literally stalked her and she had to get a restraining order from him. He was inspired by Ted in HIMYM to think that if you love someone, you should never give up on them no matter how many times they say no and eventually you'll be together. Such a ridiculously unhealthy message. "
"I wish my family had instilled healthier habits in me.  Encouraged more outdoor activities, or sports that I would not absolutely haaaaaaate, and most importantly, encouraged better eating younger.  I know that as an adult, I have the power to try new things now, but I've got 33 years of hating physical activity and vegetables to overcome."
People probably didn't mention it because it's so textbook classic horrible that it's almost too easy to call out - but no thread on this subject would be complete without them thrown in.

"Went to middle school with him, lost touch, was reintroduced 7 years ago from a mutual friend at a car show. We started talking but at first I didn't think he was 'my type' and he also smoked cigarettes so I wasn't very interested. I also recently got out of a 4 year awful relationship. However, he kept at it for 7 months until I finally caved in and gave us a try.

In October, we'll have been together for 7 years. Our relationship is incredible, even through all the crazy ups and downs. Also, he stopped smoking as soon as we started dating. 😊👌🏼"
"I can't believe interracial dating is still taboo to any degree. Even supposedly progressive people will give into it (I know from experience, with me and my SO)

It's one of those things a lot of people will in theory say is a non-issue, but most of the time that's not completely true. All they mean is that they don't think it should be *illegal*, they're not saying they're actually accepting of it"

"We got married at 18 and have been together 17 years now. 

I would say the single greatest thing is showing appreciation. It doesn't matter if he's always the one to mow the grass, say thank you. It doesn't matter if you guys decide you'll always fold the laundry, he needs to say thank you. When people feel appreciated they don't hold onto resentment, which is what I believe causes most marital problems. Plus when people feel noticed and appreciated they don't mind doing things for you and helping out.

Have a smaller house and a crappier car if it means you get to save money to explore new places. Travel. Have fun together. Every day life may be mundane but having something to look forward to helps. Have a vacation as often as possible WITHOUT your kids. 

In that same vein, wait to have kids. We waited about 7 years.

And do not call each other names and say shit you can't take back during arguments. Fight fair."
"Their financial situation. Everything is brunchy-bar-fun-daytrips-and-mimosa-type photos, when really, she's got more debt than she can shake a stick at, and her SO is extremely depressed about how bad she is with money, and she doesn't seem to know how, or care to, live beneath her means to fix it. This is a shockingly common one, IME"
"A guy I went on one date with years back ate almost his entire meal and then complained to our waitress about all sorts of things that were wrong about it.

She self proclaims herself body positive only to put down women who are skinnier (or different) than she is in her song *All About that Bass.*


I don't want to go into too much of a rant but there are so many things that are messed up about her song *Dear Future Husband,* the first gripe I have with it is how she expects everything from her husband but then goes on to talk about how she won't do jack shit for him and he has to do all of that because if he doesn't he won't get her ""special lovin,"" as feminists we are fighting to not have our value stem from being sexualized. Also in any healthy adult relationship sex is NOT a bargaining chip that women hold over men. 


These are the only songs I've ever heard from her, if anyone else has anything to add about her I would love to hear it. "

"I wouldn't have bought a house with him. 3 months before he broke up with me. On the bright side his pettiness while we sorted out me selling him my share and getting out of the mortgage really showed me what a horrible person he was.

So on second thought, maybe I wouldn't change a thing after all..."

"This really isn't that gross, but my dog is into the habit of putting his dry food into his water bowl- either by his mouth or by tipping the bowl over. So all week, at various points in the day, I have to reach into his water bowl and fish out huge, puffy, water-logged pieces of dry food. For some reason, this grosses me out IMMENSELY. I have no issues picking up his poop or cleaning up dog puke or pee but for some reason these swollen little food nuggets make me want to throw up. My husband has been doing a lot of it for me because I just can't take it anymore. 

Also, we've tried just putting some water into his food and moistening it but he'll still put a bunch of food into his water bowl, it's maddening.

"I posted on r4r looking for a guy to go on my cruise with me since the other party in my room bailed.  It was kind of a throw away post, who really expects to find someone to date from a post like that?

Turns out I actually found someone really awesome from it.  It's still super new, but I'm really optimistic when I'm not doubting myself.  I even told him in the very beginning that he wasn't my type.  (Although, I think now that my type was all wrong because he is all kinds of right for me. :-P )   

I'm still kind of floored by the whole thing, because who actually thinks that a reddit post looking for a cute guy to go on a cruise with would actually work?  "

So every night I've been washing and hanging up to dry fleece strips that help keep me from laying in pee in the bed.  Not only does my husband know but he helped wash a set of fleece one night for me because I was too busy throwing up and peeling all at once while coughing all day.

I hate stress incontinence (and  yes I have been doing kegel exercises religiously for the past 15 years before someone says they will fix the issue) and I hate when it gets to the point of bed wetting and makes me incredibly embarrassed.  My SO though takes everything in stride and is loving and gentle and supportive no matter what my physical issues are. "
"Penny and Leonard in TBBT. Granted, I stopped watching several seasons ago so they might have gotten better but I don't see them lasting. And Bernadette is a nasty person who treats Howards in a shitty way; he accepts it and I see him doing so for a long time, but I'm not certain he'll accept it forever.

OTOH, I stopped watching HIMYM after Barney's ridiculous proposal to Robin. I didn't see that lasting at all so I was glad to learn the show revealed they ended up divorced after a super short marriage. Much more realistic."

"IIRC she did push him in the beginning and they tried to make it work for a while. The problem was it was changing Jim and she couldn't find a job in the same area. Jim wasn't handling the stress well and began unloading on Pam, in even just small ways. It was unsustainable."
"At unexpected moments when we hug, one of us will get right next to the other's ear and gently, quietly, whisper, ""Ohhhh-praaaaaaaaaaaah."" 

It's disconcerting to feel the breath and sound in the ear, and we've gotten pretty good at knowing when one of us is about to try. I imagine it would be weird for someone to see us tenderly hug before one jumps back and yells ""Do NOT Oprah me right now!"""

"There's an episode mid-series (can't remember exactly which episode) where after Big fucks her over *again*, the others are sick of Carrie whining about it constantly and tell her to go talk to a therapist. So she goes, even though she doesn't really want to because she thinks Big is the one with the issue and she doesn't need to change anything. The therapist is like ""Yeah, your issue is you keep picking the wrong men. Why do you think that is?""

And Carrie really does not like this and is like nuh-UH I do not pick the wrong men, it's not my fault, it's their fault! Then she gets in a huff, sleeps with a guy she meets in the waiting room, and eventually realises the therapist was totally right when he, also, turns out to be kind of a douchebag.

Then she stops seeing the therapist because she doesn't want to run into him in the waiting room again. And she does not find another therapist.

Really that's Carrie's issue. She's capable of introspection and recognising her flaws and insecurities, but she never *does* anything to change them."

"My husband and I had a first date horseback riding followed by a picnic. That was 25 years ago so I assume by now it worked.

"Their relationship is pure abuse, thinly veiled as bdsm. What's worse is that throughout the books you are privvy to her inner thoughts, and she fucking HATES the bdsm stuff. She only ever seems to dig some of the light bondage stuff, but when it comes to anything involving pain or humiliation she's explicitly only putting up with it in the hopes that if she does he will love her and give her the romantic sex she ACTUALLY wants. It's twisted and gross. 

Plus, he does all kinds of things that have nothing to do with bdsm but are controlling as fuck. He tells her what to eat, he buys her a car and a laptop after she explicitly tells him not to (therefore making her feel beholden to him). He even sells her old car without informing her - what if she was emotionally attached to it?! She goes to visit her mom to explicitly get space from him, tells him not to come, and he shows up anyway. Then he does some sexual stuff with her *in front of her mom* despite her obvious discomfort. 

The dude is a predator and an abuser."
"Did 3 days for traffic stuff. (suspended license when I was young) it's really only bad because you're incredibly bored, you have no privacy, you are completely taken away from your life, there's no creature comforts and the days are long.

If you're going to be in long enough to get a jail job you should just to do something. Have support outside that you can call and will visit. Put funds in your account for shit when and however you can.

"Oh Lord...

I was in the middle of a terrible dry spell, and found myself a hookup on Tinder. Met in public, he was dorky and kind of overly-friendly, but not terrible.

Back to his house, started making out on the couch, and he was ALL tongue. Like, he led with tongue, tongue in my mouth, no lips, blehhhh. I kept pulling back and saying to go easy on the tongue, but he clearly had no other point of reference. So okay, no more kissing. 

Head into the bedroom, it was a mattress on the floor without a sheet, or maybe with a really old sheet? This was surprising, since the rest of his place wasn't especially neckbeard nest-y, just bachelor-y.

Minimal foreplay later, during which he prodded at me with stiff fingers, and used his tongue much like a dog licking your hand, I move us along to (what I decided would have to be) the main event.

This is where it REALLY got uncomfortable. Instead of thrusting with his hips, he thrust with his abs. Granted, I'm a fat girl, so there's extra belly in the way, but by thrusting with his abs instead of hips, he was putting constant pressure on my solar plexus, making it hard to breathe. Tried a few other positions, but he was very inexperienced, and couldn't figure out the physics, so wanted to stick to missionary. So, back to it we go, me trying to shift or give understandable feedback to get him to move differently. He took a REALLY long time to come, and by the end, I was nauseous from the awkward pressure.

Afterwards, I was getting myself off, and he decided to talk dirty through it, but apparently he had only ever read Harlequin Romance or something, so it was the cheesiest, least sexy thing ever. I recall the line ""and for one... perfect moment... we are one.""

If you've never rolled your eyes while masturbating, well, I don't recommend it.

Therapy helped me question the thoughts I was having that I was worthless, pathetic, horrible and would never amount to anything. I didn't feel worthy of love, couldn't advocate for myself, and didn't see any kind of happy future for myself. In combination with medication, my outlook got healthier, my life got better, and now I'm employed, married, live in a city I love, adopted a couple of pets, and am genuinely excited for the rest of my life.

"My childhood dog would not drink his water if there was kibble in it. Our jerk of a cat realized this and would pick up dog kibble and drop it in their shared water bowl all the time. It was purely out of spite and sometimes, I suspect, in retaliation if the dog did something that annoyed the cat. So we would come home to a thirsty dog and a smug cat and nasty waterbowls. He would carry kibble across the house to the spare waterbowls. It was impressive and gross.

The cat outlived that dog and my parents currently have another dog that does not have the same qualms. The cat has stopped putting kibble in the water bowl. But he's still a jerk."

"You guys don't think we're aware of that?!  

I lived with a woman for years, she'd get up an hour and a half before she needed to be anywhere just so she could lather minerals and paint on her face just so society would recognize her as a person.  

So she could shave and manicure areas of her body society deemed inappropriate to be unattended to.

An hour and a half of the day wasted just to be deemed presentable and much of that was spent taking short cuts to hide the less noticeable things to make her life somewhat more manageable.  

You guys don't think we notice that?!  For Christ sake, what you women do during your morning routine is nothing short of artwork.

It's astonishing what you do!  You take faces that rival the symmetry and elegance of geometry to accentuated new levels of beauty.  

And you've all perfected this effort.  It's down to a goddamned science.  It's absurd what the world expects of you guys and yet everyday you wake up in the unrelenting stress of the morning hours to exfoliate, lay foundation, brushstroke, accentuate and further define beauty.

Don't ever think it's unappreciated.  I'm sorry the world begs this of you but don't ever think it goes unnoticed.  You ladies take it to the next level.

Fuck, I wake up half hungover, shave (barely), brush my teeth and  throw some water in my hair with a half-assed comb over to even things out all in the span of 7-8 minutes and call myself presentable and society is totally cool with that.  

What you ladies do is truly on the next level.  Fuck y'all look good.  God damn."
"In college I was dating a guy from Kenya. It wasn't serious because I lived on the other side of the state for school but I would occasionally go to visit him. He played soccer so sometimes I would go with him to watch and hang out after the game with the players. We ended our relationship or whatever it was because we were at a different places in our lives but remained friendly. Few months after that I was on the soccer teams facebook page. I posted good luck in Swahili. A few minutes later I got a message from one of his teammates. He was just asking how I was and thought it was awesome how I posted that in Swahili. We chatted for a few weeks and when I went to college orientation at my new school, we met up for dinner. Later on I found out he had been attracted to me ever since he saw me at the first game I attended but couldn't act on it because I was seeing his friend. He asked my ""ex"", his good friend, for permission to date me and he was cool with it so he was waiting for his chance. That day on Facebook he took it. We have been together ever since, happily married now with a five year old daughter. Ex is still friends with us. Being with him has taught me so much. I have learned things I could never know about his culture and it has also helped my family become more open. We were the first interracial marriage in both our families. One person in my family disowned me, but as time went on they have changed their decision. I have always been the oddball in the family, different beliefs and ideals, but my family I created has done more than my words ever did when it comes to my larger family reflecting on their beliefs and actions. Anyways I digress. If my husband hadn't uprooted his life at 20 years old, leaving behind everything he had ever known, he wouldn't have come the 8,040 miles it took to find me. If I hadn't been a friend to one girl at college away from our homes, whose boyfriend at home knew the ex, I would have never found him. We should all take the time to reflect how choices and links make up the things that impact our lives most and others. When I think about it, it's a feeling I can only describe as magic."

However, this story is told in the TV world, not the real world. If you remember season one: Pam hates her job. She's not tied down to Scranton at all. But then NBC fucking demanded The Office continue past Carell's departure in season seven, and you cannot lose John Kransinki or Jenna Fischer because they're now the undisputed heart of the show. 

So, having given into the consummation of Jim and Pam's relationship early in the show's run due to a ratings downtick, the writers are now limited in the stories they can tell since the ""will they won't they"" is caput. However, though the ratings of The Office were down, they turned out to be a little more steady than other NBC comedies, letting the show live many more years than the writers  (and Steve Carell) anticipated. 

Now you're years into a TV relationship where these main characters cannot be written out, and you're running out of stories creating conflict between the two. So what do you do? You create false jeopardy. Oh no, Jim is going to leave the Scranton office! No way. That's not going to happen with Steve Carell gone. And they would never let him leave Pam. But what's the ONLY thing that will keep Jim in Scranton and not take a dream job elsewhere? Well, you can't say he's bad at this new job because that's poor characterization for Jim and will make him a little ""loser-y"" if he gets fired or fails. So you have to hinge his return on Pam.

Early The Office Pam would have packed her bags and moved away with Jim. She fucking gets it. She doesn't even have a good relationship with her parents anyway. I mean remember when her mom fucked Michael? You could argue ""but she wasn't a parent in the early seasons; I buy she'd want to stay close to family now."" You know you don't buy that. Nobody buys that.

Jim and Pam were meant to be together. They're fucking great. Don't forget: Jim did buy that house without Pam's consent. I think most people would say, ""lol dude wtf, no there's a creepy clown painting,"" but Pam was down with it. 'Cause they are soulmates! 

Don't blame Pam. Blame NBC and a writer's room that got cleaned out by Parks &amp; Rec. This is why Frasier kept Daphne and Niles away from each other for seven seasons (but they had the luxury of high ratings and multiple Emmys).

Just not get as emotionally involved. Take things even slower. 
"From a guys point of view this is a difficult balancing act.  On the one hand my wife doesn't like if I try too hard to give her an orgasm because she interprets this as pressure.  On the other one mustn't be too selfish and only think of ones own pleasure.  It's taken me time to really understand my wife's needs in this area and to communicate effectively with her.  I can see why younger men don't get it right because our typical sexual response can be pretty different.  Just an area that needs lots of communication I guess.

Also, although rare, every now and again I struggle to have an orgasm myself.  My wife is really freaked out by this usually so clearly some women also tend to see male orgasm as the end of sex..   Another area that needs lots of talking."

"I half agree. Carrie was a fucking mess. She would randomly storm his apartment in the middle of the night drunk and pissed and arm wrestle him into meeting his friends. He invites her to a party with his type of people and she insults everyone, makes a giant scene, then go make out with the caterer. Rather than asking if she can leave some stuff around, she tries to sneak stuff in. She follows him around town and introduces herself to his mother without his consent. She cancels an entire trip because he wouldn't say I love you back. Carrie made herself into the kind of girl he wouldn't want to bring any further into his life because she will fuck it up. 

The new girl was, in contrast, perfectly fitted for his world."

"This was my go to in my tinder days, if you can hold a conversation picnics are an awesome, affordable date. Get a small cooler, sandwich supplies, and a bottle of something to drink. Ask your date to bring a salad and meet up in the park, which is a nice, safe, public place. Perfect first date with a stranger, yet still fun with someone you know a lot better. My wife and I still do this from time to time."
"I can't believe I had to scroll down so far to see this. Granted, they were intended to have a super fucked up relationship, but it's so heavily romanticized by people.

'I choose my choice' feminists - we don't exist in a vacuum. Our choices are culturally conditioned and constrained. Not every choice a woman makes is a 'feminist' or 'empowering' choice - otherwise feminism (the struggle for the liberation of women and girls) is just meaningless.
"Penny and Leonard are THE WORST.  I am hate watching TBBT to hopefully watch them break up, lol.  The show writers developed their characters to a point where they are not compatible but they forced them together anyway.  

As for Bernadette and Howard - I think Howard treats Bernadette horribly.  He is selfish and lazy makes her deal with it.  But I can see your point too.  They are 2 characters that were forced together also."

I thought that my partner's insistence that we do everything together was a sign of how strong our love for each other was. I later found out that it was an early sign of abuse."
"Just how much old men truly lack boundaries or a sense of basic human decency. Bonus if said transforming man has to work in customer service, but this isn't completely necessary

"Probably more unpopular on reddit than in real life, but I think it's silly when people are super anti-marriage but turn around and say that it's ""just a piece of paper"". It's obviously more than a piece of paper (beyond the legal benefits, which I don't think most people can name or even think of when they decide to get married) and it's the symbolism and meaning of being spouses that people don't like. If it were just a piece of paper then nobody would want it and no one would be so vehemently against it. To pretend like there isn't a lot of emotional and social weight behind being a husband or wife is ridiculous. "

"It's the frames, they need to be plastic and maybe other requirements. If yours aren't approved then you get jail glasses for free, same prescription lenses but those bulky plastic 80s style army ones."

"Lynette and Tom Scavo. I think that the whole 5-kids-thing would likely keep them together, but... they didn't seem to really like each other, or respect the other.

He even stocks up the panadol menstrual pills (there was a shortage here for a year or two). He would rub my tummy until I fall asleep and will cook me some of comfort food.

"When I was about 9 and my brother was 7, my dad rented a beautiful cabin in the Adirondacks for the long weekend. We were so excited. We were woodsy kids and loved hiking, fishing, swimming in lakes, all that stuff.

I guess I couldn't handle the altitude, because as soon as we got out of the car I started vomiting. I vomited outside the cabin. I vomited next to the gorgeous lake. I vomited everywhere.

We spent one night and had to leave first thing the next morning because I just couldn't stop vomiting. I felt so bad."

"Dated a guy that would do all of these things yet they weren't out of kindness, it was always out of expecting sonething in return.

He also bragged about himself as he went to a private expensive college, and about how much of a 'nice guy' he was to take me out, pay for fuel etc. He also made snarky remarks about my education, as I was at a public high school.

We went out to the movies, then he guilt tripped me into paying for my own ticket..even though I bought money for myself??

We didn't order any food, and he let me choose the movie which I thought was considerate of him. Then I realized he couldn't care less about me, he just wanted a pass. As the movie proceeded he blurts out, ""so uh we gunna make out or not?""

When that wasn't working for him, he started touching my thighs which made me extremely uncomfortable. I pecked him a few times, as I had felt pressured and knew he was my only ride home.

Finally the movie ended, I had never felt so relieved..or so I thought. So we get in the car, I'm just looking forward to my time alone. He's driving, I soon realize he's stopping at a deserted  shady park. He didn't even mention going here before the date. 

Was having a panic attack, but I was just thankful it was still daytime, finding out I clearly couldn't trust him. I then begin frowning and I ask, ""why are we here?"" He's upset at my response, ""why are you so ungrateful, I took you out! Let's just chill here for a bit"" 

So we're laying under a tree on the grass, and he starts hugging me forcefully trying to get on top of me. That drew the line for me, I got up and said ""You're not like this around other people""

He laughs at my face and says, ""there's a time and place for everything"" I was just so tired, I felt so disrespected and taken advantage of, thinking he genuinely liked me . Keep in mind I was 15, he was 18 at the time.

So we're back in the car and he's driving me home FINALLY. He's dropping me off and he says, ""so I do I get a kiss?"" hahaha the nerves on this one was bold huh.

I spat in his face and slapped him across the face, I ran home in tears but thankful I wasn't violated any further..if I ever see that mf to this day..smh!"

She calls other girls who works with her ""her daughters"" because they are smarter and more successful than me.

"Hello! I love road trips! I've been to 46 of the US States and have driven Canada coast to coast. That being said, here are some of my tips:



1) Bring a wide mouth bottle to pee in in case of emergency. You may never use it, but you'll be so happy if you ever do need it. A wide mouth Nalgene bottle is perfect.


2) Download some music, podcast, and/or audiobooks for the road. When Pandora cuts out due to lack of service, they're really nice to have.


3) if you're trying to save some money, considered getting a good cooler to bring with you. I have a Yeti, and I bring prepackaged meals that I cooked at home so I don't have to spend so much money when I'm on the road. Restaurant breaks are nice though, you just can't always afford to do them all the time.


4) If you are sleeping in your vehicle, get a gym membership. I have a van that I'm converting into a camper van, and it has a nice big comfortable bed, food, a toilet, etc. The one thing it doesn't have is a shower. For $20 a month, I can shower at any Planet Fitness location in to us.


5) Get something for self-defense. You can get some pepper spray, a good knife, a baseball bat, just something that you're comfortable with and you know how to use if the time ever comes.


6) If you happen to be a person of color, consider keeping your registration and insurance information clipped to your sun visor. If you do that and are stopped by a police officer, you won't need to reaching away that may look suspicious to a cop.


7) Leave room in your agenda for some down time. I love going to the beach or local parks to just breathe and relax in nature. Sometimes, you can find a local bookstore or a museum to go to.


8) Pick your travel companions wisely -especially if the trip is going to be long! I've gone on road trips that took multiple weeks. A road trip can make or break a relationship (romantic or platonic).


9) Bring one of your hobbies with you, if it's portable enough. You can bring small instruments like ukuleles, or art supplies, or crochet and knitting needles. 


10) Look up local events happening in the town's you're going to pass through. Sometimes you'll find something super cool, quirky, or just fun that will make for a great story.


11) Don't be afraid to talk to people and tell them that you're traveling. You should trust your judgment, right? So when you feel comfortable, strike up conversations with the people around you about where you're from, where you're headed, suggestions on places to go, things like that. You'll find at the locals know the area the best and have the best suggestions.   "
"You probably live in the U.S, overseas (At least were I've lived: Africa, Middle East, south of Europe) guys tend to have the same deep and close friendships, and do use each other as a support system.

The way they did it made it seem pathetic on both their parts"

"People inside are treated equally. There's always someone in your business. No privacy. Sometimes, when you go ""outside"" to rec, it's an area about the size of your average American living room. The only outside you see is the sky. Cinder walls everywhere. Find out about the policy on bringing in plain white t-shirts, panties (plain cotton briefs) and socks. Some places let you bring in new, unopened bags to property. 

Find out a way to make trustee. This often will cut your time in half, and help you retain sanity. 

Most places have a law library. You can always sign up to go, if only just to give you something to do. Keep in mind sometimes your trip there is at 12am. 

Mealtimes are usually very, very early. Breakfast at 4:30-5am, lunch around 10am and dinner around 4pm. It's inedible. You can request a vegetarian tray to keep away from the mystery meat and get you more veggies. Commissary is a life saver. 

Pads--sometimes you only get one or two per shift. If you need more, request to go to medical so it's on your file that the guards have to provide you with more. 

Bartering is a thing. For instance, if you can make tampons out of pads, or have some other type of skill, like hair styling, coloring, anything, you can often score chocolate/better food from other inmates. 

Laundry soap is not provided to you, so do loads with your cell mate or bunkmate or someone you befriend. 

It will always be cold. The beds are painful. You will not be able to have any privacy in the bathroom area. "
"Yup. I'm a guy, but I totally get what you mean. 

""Just go out and travel.""

I would love to. Really, I would. But I'm not a trust fund baby whose parents will just spring for a year long galavant across Europe. Understand, my parents are the furthest thing from poor, and I grew up quite privileged compared to most Americans, but that shit is EXPENSIVE. I'll be damned if I go up to my parents asking to help me any more than they already have."
"Gave an extended speech about how he was exclusively attracted to much younger, very plain, very childlike-looking women. I'm extremely obviously none of those things, so he explained that he was here to ""work on"" this preference of his and broaden his horizons; turns out the teenagers weren't lining up to date his middle-aged ass, somehow. He expressed great puzzlement that this delightful and well-adjusted statement didn't result in pantslessness or further dates. I've heard some foot-in-mouth material on dates, but that guy creeped me out the hardest. "

"Yeah in this vein, the couple from King of Queens. They are both just pretty terrible. Shit he was even a character from Raymond actually. "
I'm financially stable.  I'm not on any meds and am basically healthy.  I have great eyebrows.  
Maybe everybody in my life just plans really well but I have never had or seen that happen lol
"&gt;  I cheer myself up by imagining how confused and horrified they would be if all women suddenly stopped wearing makeup for a week.

My gf takes a more minimalistic approach to her makeup, especially at work...but on the rare occasions she skips makeup, she's asked if she's sick or told she looks tired."
Heathcliff &amp; Cathy. Granted they weren't ever together but they were terrible for everyone. It drives me demented when I hear women talk about finding their Heathcliff. He murdered his wife's dog. On their wedding day! He is not a romantic hero. They would not have ended up happily ever after together because they are both terrible people.
"Yeah, it was very much a ""congratulations, you assholes deserve each other"" thing."
"The holy cow I'm the girl who gives a shit if her boyfriend watches porn 
Basically I was always like nah it wouldn't bother me and he can do what he wants.
One night me and my SO were chatting and he said he does from time to time and I don't know why but it hurt. I honestly don't know why it made me feel like that but I always find myself if we have an argument I say something about if porn does the job off you go... or you don't need me you've porn sure. 
Idk it is weird and I'm sorry 😂"
"That could potentially be a long list, but I guess the biggest thing is that I wish that mental health, and developmental disorders and whatnot hadn't been such a taboo in my household growing up.

I've always struggled with depression, and with self-harm, and asked my mom for help several times when I was younger. She was always dismissive, and would tell me about how I had nothing to be sad about, how I had to just get over it, how I just needed to trust in God and to pray more, and blah blah blah. In the irony of all ironies, her only real concern was that if she did get me the help that I was asking for, that it would somehow reflect poorly on her and people might think she was a bad mother.

I also had to find out at 27 years old that I have autism. It came out that my mom suspected as much when I was a kid, and that she knew how badly I struggled socially, but she just didn't think it was important enough because ""it wasn't like [I] was mute or had a serious learning disability.""

Yup."
"We do this thing called ""Chameleon Hand"" which i accidentally started one time when I was watching videos of Chameleons being adorable.

Basically you make your hand look like a chameleon's, and then you hold it really far from your SO's face, and slowly move it towards them. You do this until you touch their face and whisper ""chameleon hand"". He does it really slowly to me and it usually makes me really squirmy and giggly as I anticipate the hand reaching me."
"he had severe phimosis and sex had never worked. we were broken up and living together and he told me he was too horny to sleep and i pretty much had to let him try.

i laid there as he squished his limp dick against my ass for like 15 minutes. the sensation i can only describe as the world's weirdest and most concentrated sponge bath. 

he eventually asked why i wasn't reacting and i told him he wasn't in. he asked why i didn't say anything and i was just like ''idk you seemed so enthusiastic'' and he huffed, rolled off, and went to sleep."
"Academic biotechnology labs are still massive boy's clubs, and overt sexism is completely acceptable there, so I guess what shocks me the most is that male researchers think sexism is okay and are shocked that women want to be scientists. Women in science should not be controversial. One of my male TAs told my entire female lab group that we we're ""terrible scientists because we don't have a man in our group."" We got the highest scores, consistently, in our nanopharmacology lab. "
I am in touch with my exes and also on friendly terms with them. 
"I'm very thankful for my IUD.  I had ovarian cysts for about a decade before the doctors figured that, hey, maybe taking narcotics twice a month and skipping classes/work/life wasn't ideal.  Haven't had a real period in a year.  But most importantly, I haven't wished for a hysterectomy in a year. :)"
"Someone said something along the lines of, ""There's always one teenager who blasts punk music in suburban neighborhoods because they are so desperate to non-conform.""

*No one in my neighborhood does tha---oh...*"
"she shouldn't have to give up anything for him but yet she still did. I was annoyed when she was pregnant with *his* baby, he was with someone else while she had to give up dating. There are so many things wrong with that relationship but they're the It couple for the show."
We have voices for our dogs and narrate their actions 
I've read the books literally 20 times (been a while though) and can't see a reason why they should be in each other's way. They are both very different people but I don't see why that's a bad thing. Pretty sure both are capable of making compromises. Hermione is too clever not to and Ron grew up with 4 brothers and a sister in a poor family. His whole life was one giant compromise. 
Lane and Zach on Gilmore Girls. She settled so hard. I'm still mad about it. 
It depends on where you are. I work for a national and a multinational company - the multinational is Helion Research. You sign up and complete some training and then self assign anything that fits your availability.
Don't have one but I would totally sell my dirty panties if anyone knows some pervs.
"Lol I ask my boyfriend to do this all the time! I'll just starfish in the middle of his bed and ask him to lay on top of me, with his arms and legs stretched out over mine. Then I pretend to hyperventilate right next to his ear and he gets all tickly and oh god we're so gross"
"Learn a second language. I'm not fluent but I can hold basic conversation, read fluently, and understand a bit. 

Do pushups. I couldn't even do one real one. Now I can do lots! 

Run 5km. 

Be in a relationship. "
100% of the time. Which has yet to stop me from ignoring it...
Feeling obligated to go to another birthday/anniversary/baby shower/wedding/etc. It's too much money and time. People's expectations are out of control. 
"Also him defending her chastity by insisting they save themselves for their wedding night, which occurs like a week after high school graduation."
"I was so mad, I paid half for movers to move our stuff from one apartment to another, then he dumped me a month later and I couldn't afford movers again for my stuff, and he kept most of the big stuff. So I basically paid to move him to a new place, then moved all my stuff out by myself. Ouch."
"After the books came out I received so many messages from ""doms"" on fetlife that just said something like ""send me a pic of you spread."" No greeting, no message of substance, just a laughable demand because my profile said I was submissive. These idiots don't realize that isn't bdsm, it's abuse. I hate those books for ruining the scene for a while."
"I had an abscess lanced.... on my ass. Everyday, 2x a day, I clean and change the band aid and marvel at the gaping, pus-filled hole."
It's happened to me once and never even came close again. But holy shit. It felt so good I started crying and couldn't stop. Simply amazing.

"Since I was raped five months ago I've gotten comments ranging from ""you tease men a lot"" to ""you always wear short dresses - you were going to get raped sooner or later. You'll get raped again if you don't stop dressing that way"" to ""you shouldn't have been walking down that street in the first place, that was your first mistake""."
That was it? :/
"There was just nothing between them besides shared trauma imo... You could argue that that is why they got together, life is not a fairytale etc. but I would then rather have seen Katniss remain single. I also highly doubt that she would be able to be convinced to have children, after their history. It just felt very forced. "
"&gt; That's when he goes on a rant about how women won't date short nice guys, because they're so shallow. He rants this to me, a woman he is on a date with...

i know this feel. always fun to give a guy a chance only to be reminded that you apparently don't count as a woman."
"And even if you do, how much the penis gets in the way of orgasmic vaginal clenching. It's like trying to sing opera with a whole bag of marshmallows stuffed in your mouth! The song is there, but the quality really suffers."
"We first met when I was a senior in high school, through a mutual friend. After our initial meeting, we would bump into each other in random places around town, and he always seemed nice and easy going. I was always happy to see him and would always say hello. Eventually he asked me out on a
date. 

The date was, well, a little odd at first. I meet him to go out to dinner and a movie - I am climbing in the front of his SUV when I lock eyes with another guy who is sitting in the back. My date sees my shock and quickly explains the situation: he had made prior plans with his BFF three weeks ago for this date and time, I had changed our initial plans last minute and requested the same date and time (this is totally true, I did) and he wanted to appease both parties. During dinner, my date's friend is telling stories about the two of them growing up together and they both had me laughing. In the end, his BFF was the ultimate wingman and really made the date memorable and fun and light hearted. 

After our first date, though, I was  convinced he would be a great friend, but he wasn't the one for me. We kept hanging out, and despite the fact that I didn't want to like him, I did. A lot. 

We shared a lot of interests, but also had different hobbies that we kind of introduced to the other. We could talk for hours about music, movies, the news, things we had read, ideas, dreams, etc. We were both moving in the fall to different towns for college. My plan was to be single and do my own thing. And I didn't want the whole long distance thing for my freshman year. 

My ""plans"" did not hold up and we became a steady thing that fall. Somehow we made it work. We were about to celebrate our first Valentine's Day together when I went in to get my vision checked and get new glasses. During the visit, my doctor realized my optic nerve was enlarged. He had my GP order a MRI and is was discovered I had a neurological condition and would need to have an emergency brain and spinal surgery ASAP.

Throughout the whole ordeal, he was by my side. Always at the hospital. Helping out with my parents. Assisting me with my recovery post op. It was a lot to go through, and we were both only 19. 

At 20, I transferred to his university and we moved in together. We randomly decided one day that it was time time to plan our wedding.  We were both talking and the subject of marriage came up and we realized it wasn't a matter of if, it was just when. We just knew we wanted to be together, and be together for a very long time. He didn't even have a ring and we were broke ass poor living in this tiny apartment each working shitty part time jobs and going to college full time. But I didn't care. I was just happy to have him and still be alive. Our parents, extended family, friends, and others were shocked and tried to dissuade us because ""we were too young.""

We got married in the fall in a little glass chapel in the woods with less than 30 people in attendance. It was perfect. And so us. 

We were married a couple years, and sure enough, like everyone said, we did start having problems. Everything came to a head one night and devolved into a screaming match where I told him I hated him and threw a pack of Oreos across the room that hit him in the face. I guess the Oreos were the last straw in a heap of straws. He went completely calm and dead eyed and said he wanted a divorce. He meant it. I knew it, he knew it. It was just over. We were 23. 

I moved out and into my own place. We separated but neither of us moved forward with the divorce thing. I'm not really sure why. We talked maybe 2 times in 6 months. Eventually, we started opening up and really discussing our marriage and issues that arose. We actually sat down from one another and without anger or malice or jealousy just listen to what the other had to say. We also tried to come up with a plan of action on how to avoid the patterns and behaviors that we were exhibiting previously as a married couple. 

Next year we will celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. He is not the man I expected to marry. He is not the man I would have dreamed to marry. But he most definitely the man I need and who needs me, my companion for life, and my soulmate. We just balance each other out. And every year I fall that much more in love with him. It's not always rainbows and sunshine. Marriage really takes hard work and commitment. But we have decided together that the other person is worth that - and we try to talk about that and always keep it in perspective. "
"Actually, logically, it's the smartest way to unite the north and south. But okay."
"actually, it's meant to be held up as the prime example of an unhealthy relationship. It's like people seeing The Punisher and thinking, ""I want to be him so bad!"", no you don't."
"Ugh, I was one of those ""I'm not like other girls"" who read ""deep"" books (John Green type), liked ""nerdy things"", and only hung out with guys because ""girls are too much drama"" "
"He asked if I'm a football fan and I am and he asked if I liked the Patriots (We're both from Massachusetts so obviously I do). He then proceeded to argue &amp; somewhat yell at me about how I'm ""not a real fan"" because I don't know this player in the 90s or some shit.
I was like is this really happening? Sounded like a bad date in a movie."
"God they are HORRIBLE, even in the last couple episodes Ross is so controlling and insecure. Zero character growth for him over the course of the series. Not to mention that Phoebe is a terrible friend for always insisting that they belong together!"
Rory has always been awful. It was excusable in the original run because she was so young but after watching the revival I guess she's just an awful person through and through. 
"My theory is that they had some kind of outline of events that were supposed to happen in the last season of the original run, and just used them in the revival instead. Mistakes Rory should have made when she was 22 became mistakes she made when she was 30, and all of it became far less excusable. I *hated* revival Rory."

"My boyfriend and I just moved to a new city, and we're spending a considerable amount of time alone together now. Turns out there are a whole bunch of cooperative and two-player games. Not all board games are player vs player anymore, and a lot of them are really fun. "
"They were both awfully written characters but seriously it reinforces the whole ""don't date someone older"" thing. 


He manipulated the living shit out of her."
"Just for a fun story, my first ever boyfriend and I got together when we were 15. He was my first ever kiss. We lasted about a month because he was quite sexual (he was not at all aggressive or putting any pressure on me, he was very sweet) and despite feeling quite into it and really interested in becoming sexual I was incredibly shy and nervous and broke up with him.

It's now 20 years later and apparently I've dated everyone else in the last 20 years as my first boyfriend just got back in touch with me and has asked me on a date. Maybe my first will also be my last! (Plus everyone else in between...)"
Today on my lunch break I got Botox and then walked back to my car with the giant Cyclebar magnet on the trunk (but I really want an SUV) while wearing a JCrew pencil skirt and a brand new leather handbag. Gotta get ready for my wedding bc also I'm engaged. Wtf. 13yo Marilyn Manson listening me would just give up all hope. She'd crawl under a rock and perish. 
"One guy I ""had sex"" with seriously finished before he really even penetrated me. If hadn't been wearing a condom, he would have came on my thighs. I would have felt bad for the guy if he seemed embarrassed or even neutral but he looks at me and goes, ""did you cum?""

The second time (yeah, I know) he may have lasted 20 seconds, like two strokes. Somehow, didn't cum then either."
Penny and Leonard have nothing in common and she shits on all the stuff that he's info but that's ok cos she's hot... That's a lovely lesson. It's so stupid.
"I'm basic as hell. I love pumpkin spice lattes, I wear yoga tights everywhere, I use vocal fry too much. I actually want uggs because they're comfy but I can't afford them."
"I mean I'm sorry I like things that are good, pfft. Leggings are comfy, puffy costs are warm, flavored lattes are delicious. Fuck it."
"White feminists who don't stand up for or fight for women of color/disabled women/etc. It's not all about us and we're constantly forgetting that.

Also feminists who say that trans women don't belong in the movement."
"How frequent sexual harassment and sexual assault is. 

How creepy it is, and how unflattering it is. 

Topped with the expectation that at some level I ""must enjoy it.""

"It is really surprising how many people will straight-up confess to being rapists or pedos, as long as you don't use those words. "
"""I don't like reading"" 

And 

""What do you like to do for fun?"" 

""Get fucked up.""

"100%. I remember seeing an Andy Rooney thing once where he talked about why being with a woman in her 40s was so great. Paraphrased it was that she didn't always have to do what you're doing and she's probably doing something more interesting anyway.

My husband and I love to be together and we are together a lot since we both work from home. We like it that way. But we also aren't afraid to do our own things. He loves to go to a board game gathering on Sundays but it's really loud and gives me headaches, so I just do something else and enjoy that time a lot. 

Another big part of it for us is that we are both totally in the boat and committed. There are no arguments where we talk about splitting up. It's just not even a consideration. Disagreements are just that. We disagree. There are many things where we never will agree but we have a healthy respect for that.

Edit - married 15 years.
