" ""To users manager

cc John's manager 

User requested access to John's email and refused to provide a business reason and did not want to wait for manager approval for this highly unusual request. """
Now *THAT'S* a punchline. 
I'll never understand people like this.
"""Okay, on your keyboard, hold down the Windows key and press the pause/break key. You should get a screen that comes up..""

""Yeah""

""k. Halfway down there is a line that says Computer Name...?""

.... After 10 years, I've got this down pat. Plus.... You never need to know this key combo, 'Unless you Break Windows.' "
"I think my heart just grew a little reading this story. Well done, OP! &lt;3"
Does it have a power cable? It's an IT problem. It doesn't have a power cable? Still an IT problem. 
"She sounds like ""one of those people"" who throw away **all** the cables because ""it's wireless, right?""."
So you let legal and HR know that EP was trying to bully you into telling them the source of the anonymous complaint right? At least for documentation purposes.
"This! If they both really wanted it, why wouldn’t a manager agree? It’s creepy what the user wanted. "
He's from the wartoaster gaming forums.
"""I could have spent another 50 bucks for the better model, but frankly it's worth my time for you to charge me $100/hr to look at this"" "
"Had a new task supervisor in our small engineering company.  She had been an associate math professor at a big university; did not make tenure, and hired into our company with her PhD.  Our company liked PhDs to impress the clients.  Side note:  Her scarves probably cost more than my entire wardrobe.  

She told the manager that she thought I should go.  I was old, ugly, scarred and ""did not promote an appropriate image.""  

Manager told her I made more money for the company than the rest of the crew; the clients loved me; and if anybody left it would not be BobT21."
"When you said it would instantly try to log in again, that was exactly my first thought. 

Reminds me of the episode of Silicon Valley where hundreds of gigs of data is being deleted and they think they were hacked when it was just an investor that accidentally set a bottle of tequila on the delete key of one of their laptops."

"Someone asking me to let them use my computer for three months is like asking to let them wear my underwear for three months. The answer is no. Get your own underwear. On the off-chance that I have no choice, I don't really want the underwear back at the end."
"I'm on a mailing list for something I help with at church. A few weeks ago, someone sent the list an email with an empty body and the subject line ""Plz I wan a job"". That's also a pretty ineffective strategy, but at least it didn't waste a lot of my time."
"Mark this shit NSFW.

Jesus - I can't be seen in this state here.

""Fix it"""
"Had a group of workers once that were actively sharing passwords without the knowledge of managers or IT. 

Got a call one day when an assistant editor (on staff) complained that he wasn't able to access his email. Remote in, everything appears fine. He continued to complain, so I stop by his desk and have him explain in person. After 20 minutes of a bizarre explanation, we get to the crux of the problem: he has an article deadline to make, and the staff writer was out of the office that day. Therefore, his brilliant plan was to call me, have me reset his co-worker's password, and grant him access because he was certain her article would be there.

I told him kindly to shove it, recorded it as a potential breech of security, and reported the interaction to my supervisor, his supervisor, and so on.

Once the staff writer returned to work, we called a meeting with her. She owned up to sharing her password with the assistant editor and several other employees. She admitted that the password exchange was common practice in their department because they couldn't be bothered to go through the process of looking things up and forwarding emails on request. It just so happened that the day before she took off, she had reset her password after receiving a suspicious email and had forgotten to tell her co-workers.

A department wide emergency meeting was called along with a written warning for all known parties. We laid down the law: do it again, and you're fired. No sharing of passwords, ever, under any circumstances. 

They grumbled and complained for a bit, especially the assistant editor. One day, the CFO and head of HR pulled him aside and set him straight. Finally got them to stop, but eventually found out that they had created an unauthorized gmail email account with shared access and were storing secure company documents there...

EDIT: Wasn't expecting such a huge response! But here are some additional details -

1. I no longer work there.

2. The work environment was cliquish and slow to adapt. The assistant editor was on good terms with the CEO, and often behaved like a self-entitled brat because he could get away with things. He destroyed several pieces of hardware as well during the time that I was there. One of my defining moments was when he wrecked his PC so we had to downgrade him.

3. There was an existing fileshare, and we also purchased licenses for other cloud utilities to facilitate their work flow. Thing is, they just preferred doing it their way and breaking rules rather than adhering to internal protocol.

4. We would not/could not ban gmail or social media sites as this department actually utilized certain related tools for their job. Yes, Google docs was explored as a possible interim solution, but was quickly abused by staff and contractors. We at one point added a personal responsibility clause into our policy that essentially stated that each employee accepted personal responsibility for how they handled any company related docs, but the corporate lawyer threw a fit and it was removed. I have no idea what process they've implemented since I left, and honestly don't care. 

5. Additionally, there were about 20-30 shared inboxes that were never utilized. And they regularly requested new ones that were never used. Why? Because they were just a difficult group of people to deal with."
"100% this, if it confuses user, it's ITs problem."
"HAH!!! half way through the story my brain was shouting ""who has called and gotten eyes on the device?""

on a related note this is why i tend to unplug the keyboard and mouse from any machine that doesn't get regular use but needs to remain onllne and connected (no keyboard mouse or screen and the worst case scenario you hav to figure out who stole them when you need it logged in locally)"
"&lt;html&gt;  
I can has job now? "
"&gt; Turns out Lana had all the info on the 62,000 schools, which needed to be treated and ranked, on a Word document because she found Excel too complicated.

I'm gonna guess that the previous ""tech guy"" actually left Lana an Excel spreadsheet with the methodology baked in, and she *couldn't figure out how it worked.*  Which is why she dropped it in the lap of our hapless Peter."
"There's a reason we say ""Hello, I.T. Have you tried turning it off and on again?"""
"&gt; That doesn't sound right. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Is there someone more knowledgeable I could speak to?

I was thinking the same thing. Can you put your husband on?"
You're too cryptic; there's no way I could ever guess which store you work in... 😅😅😅
"You reset her password in *HR SYSTEM*

She has used that password for everything

**IT IS KNOWN**"
"Yup! Sales is cutthroat like that. 

Or when someone gets terminated / quits you'll have the guy who sat in the desk next to him calling and asking for the salesforce data to be sent to him. ""Sorry that goes to the manager and they can forward it to you, you need to talk to them"" *quickly hangs up*"
"I know that I should. The thought crossed my mind immediately after he left, except I haven't yet. With some additional things that are going on I worry that this isn't someone I should be making a full on enemy of yet; so far my boss has been deflecting the brunt of some other semi-related difficulties while other cards are in play and I decided to keep this one in my pocket. "
"Hah! I read through that whole thing going ""What? This is bullshit! There is no way that both Legal and HR signed off on letting IT Support berate (or even talk to) employees who have just been fired! That's just a minefield for wrongful termination claims!""

You got me, you magnificent sonofabitch. You got me."
"You might want to crosspost this in /r/ChoosingBeggars, because that's exactly what he is :)."
"Document and date it, at least. Store that documentation away safely in the filing cabinet/disk archives."
"You wpuld be horrified at my work then. 

The building manager (read: top dog in the company in the entirety of north america, across 3 branches) felt it was a security issue that he didnt know the passwords to everyones workstations, and so remedied this by enacting a new policy: everyones passwords for all buisness related accounts and workstations must be ""password"" so he can access it in an emeegency"
"Wozniak, Wayne, &amp; Jobs' Wizardly Wares"
"&gt;You're tech support. You should know this better than me.

*refuses to believe that tech support knows better than her*"
Sounds like a story I read here before where customer thought their Amazon Echo contained the Internet... And disconnected their actual router...
"Story behind your ~~name~~ flair, please?"
I support a lot of salespeople and they try and pull this shit all the time. 
Thank you!
"&gt;  The next day, $Supe comes up to me and tells me that $Boss wants me to give him the password to my user account, ""just in case"". He reassures me that it would only be used in emergencies. I am not reassured, but again, I have no choice.

&lt;Insert extensive series of expletives here.&gt;

At a few companies I've worked at, that could have got both you and your boss fired. Password sharing is Not OK^^TM, and that was super scummy by your boss to pressure you into doing it."
How can people have a job without knowing how their tools work? This just baffles me.
I suddenly feel like peter jackson. Should have ended it at 2. But had to go for 3. 
"Firing is permanent, but a user who has been beaten until they toe the line and never waver is worth their weight in DDR4. Not to mention that if you can use them to beat their department into shape as well, you're even better off."
You are the good that is barely left in this world.
I wish I could bottle the sound of utter defeat 
"This is why I just don't interact with certain users. 

Make eye contact, grab a blank page, and re-make the sign directly in front of her. 

I've done this so many times when a user complains the conference room PC was off. Write up a sign that says ""NEVER SHUT DOWN THIS PC"""

"Welcome to IT, where 99 percent of software bugs are user error"
Quit now before you are held accountable or blamed for stolen data. This is a disaster waiting to happen.
"I didn't know about that trick thanks.

I've been directing people to right click on ""my computer"" or ""this computer"" and go to properties."
This is the correct follow-up response. Please tell me this was done.

"“Sir, the longer you keep me from my current appointment, the further back your appointment is being pushed.”"
Is there a story behind your flair?
"I worked at a Cell Phone repair shop and had a similar issue arise.

An elderly couple had been keeping their dead son's phone active for something like a year, they called me up asking if I could record/retrieve the recording of his ""You have reached my voicemail"" message.

I went and bought some special cables and stuff in order to do the job, but he never answered his phone when I called to let him know I was able to perform the task.

Still feel sad thinking about it."
Why? To steal sales? 
"The pizza comments over there reminded me of an old tale I used to hear kicked around when I played World of Warcraft. Guy's halfway through a four hour raid when he hears an alarm go off: his computer's overheating. Rather than pull the plug and leave 39 people holding their breath, he pops the case open (with the machine still running) and discovers the tower fans have stopped working. He fiddles with the wires for a few minutes until the next heat alarm goes off, and he goes into panic mode.

Luckily, he's left his teamspeak on open mic the whole time and one of his raid buddies stops laughing long enough to say ""dude, don't you live in Alaska? Open a window."" Sure enough, scooting the tower across the desk into the path of the bone-chilling fresh air cooled down the chips (and the warmed the incoming air to the point where the room was only mildly uncomfortable) so he could get back to killing dragons."
"That sounds likely. It was the same guy who had handled that yearly process every year as long as anyone can remember, I bet he had a solid way to do it but Lana just couldn't understand it so she had someone else do it for her. And I believe she gave him the bare minimum info to work with (not a word on the methodology and just a Word file with all the info copy pasted on it) because she had no idea how anything worked and didn't want to lose face by admitting ignorance."
"&gt;""You are expendable...""

... should have been immediately followed by ""and you're fired.""

No one should be able to get away with the kind of mistreatment Lana heaped upon Peter."
"""Okay"". ::jams qtips in users ears::  ticket closed."
Tl;dr: threw the book at it. The book was the problem.
"Things like 'The Terminator' should NEVER be given away.   
They should be placed in a glass-fronted, locked cabinet, with aa plaque stating where it came from, what happened, and that it can still be POWERED ON!   
Customers who are shown around will be morbidly fascinated to see the half-melted plastic, then awestruck by the fact that it could take that kind of abuse. Then they will assume that the kit you're planning to set up at their office is equally resilient.  "
"And this is why external backups are extremely useful for data stored on a PC accessible to others while you're gone for 3 months :)

"Its funny when:


$Me Hey have you tried rebooting? This issue is often solved by a reboot.



$User oh yea of course, don't worry, I tried rebooting many times


I check task manager and see computer wasn't rebooted for over 60 hours


$Me How exactly do you ""reboot"" because this machine wasn't rebooted for over 60 hours.


$user well meehhh I did but... huhhh... I dunno aaaa I wil reboot ans call back


User doesn't call back"
...that’s it?
"""I wrote a speech for this"" - i am dying here, man. :DD"
"Thankfully, everything on that drive had a backup of some sort, either because it was Dropbox data, or because it was in a git repo.  It just took an age to restore."
