"That may be the party line from dad, but guess what? Husbands die, husbands get disabled, husbands abandon wives and run off with floozies.  A woman needs to be able to support herself if shit hits the fan."
Yep sounds like he cheated. Jumping in the shower right away is a huge flag. 
"the pity play! read this:

&gt;“After listening for almost twenty-five years to the stories my patients tell me about sociopaths who have invaded and injured their lives, when I am asked, “How can I tell whom not to trust?” the answer I give usually surprises people. The natural expectation is that I will describe some sinister-sounding detail of behavior or snippet of body language or threatening use of language that is the subtle giveaway. Instead, I take people aback by assuring them that the tip-off is none of these things, for none of these things is reliably present. Rather, the best clue is, of all things, the pity play. The most reliable sign, the most universal behavior of unscrupulous people is not directed, as one might imagine, at our fearfulness. It is, perversely, an appeal to our sympathy.”  ― Martha Stout, The Sociopath Next Door"
"I had a family member with a similar situation. A guest of his wife that overstayed her welcome, and his wife was too timid to ask the guest to leave. So he invited some of his friends to come and stay. Told his wive's guest that unfortunately he had some friends coming to town, and she would need to vacate in order to accommodate. Totally worked. She didn't even make a fuss. She knew she had milked it as long as she could.

Word of warning though depending on where you live: some places would consider these ""friends"" your tenants now. You might have to actually give them a 30 days notice of eviction in writing. "
"Well, it is a bit mean of me to suggest this, but do you suspect that Jake's crowd is getting a little bit tired of hearing how wonderful Maddy is all the time when she doesn't seem to have actually done much with her life?  I wonder how many of them have had their own accomplishments minimized because Maddy's cheer section was so eager to get the pom-poms out.  From your description, I don't know how clueless she truly is, but I have a sense that she doesn't really fit in with Jake's friends because of her artificiality. "
She actually sounds like a great mom. I hope she can see that
"Wait, he doesn't listen when you talk &amp; calls you boring when you catch him doing it? 
That is nasty, disrespectful behaviour. AKA a huge red flag! "
"&gt;If I'd known she was so upset about the pregnancy test, I would have cancelled the appointment on the spot.

Really? REALLY? Don't you think that would have kicked off your concerns and suspicions, causing you to go off the deep end? What a horrible position to put a loyal partner in. 

You fucked this up bigtime, and your marriage may never recover. If it doesn't, your chances of having a strong relationship with your child are slim. You should give your wife whatever space she needs, go to therapy, and tell her you're working on your issues and will do whatever it takes to become the person she deserves to be married to. Or support her as a coparent if she decides to divorce you. Which will be up to her to decide. On HER timeline and in whatever way SHE deems best. And if that means you don't see her until after the baby's born, you are just going to have to suck this up."
"Dude. This is the best thing that's happened to you in _years_. We never realize how damaging and draining people like her can be. They're disgusting, repulsive, unfaithful pieces of shit, and you deserve to finally be happy.  

Of course go no contact. If your friends ask, tell them that she couldn't keep her legs closed.  
You're 25, about to hit the prime of your life. Go have fun and do you. Things are going to be great. "
Ugh. I'm so petty bc all of these are things I'd say. 
"Thank you for the advice! I'll be sure to tell my boyfriend that. To be fair, I am also looking for a new friend group because most of the folks in our old group are my boyfriend's friends, so they're really close with R too. I am not close to any of them, so I plan to drop them when I find a new group to hang out with. The only other person who was not friends with my boyfriend first is my best friend, hence why he was the only one who voiced how horrible it was that I was excluded from the group. "
"I can imagine that would be really hard to read, so I would stop reading her comments. 

But if you're recognizing some bad behaviors in what she's writing, you should use that to become a better person. That's all life is imo. Learning and growing. 

And lastly, it can be hard to change the dynamics of familial relationships, but it's not impossible. You could be honest with her about reading some things she wrote, and tell her what you're doing to make positive changes within yourself as a result. Maybe this will keep her from getting defensive. Then you can talk about how it doesn't seem to bother her in the moment, but she writes negatively about it later. Can she talk to you instead? What can you both do to improve communication? This is only if you want a close relationship. 

If not, don't mention it and be kinder when you're around her."
"It's easier for her to be angry at you for your hair than it is to be at your dad for dying, so she's redirecting her rage onto you. O
It's not fair but it's understandable.

And your grief doesn't have to look like anyone else's. Cry when you need to, not when you ""should"".

I'm sorry for your loss."
"They always tell me months ahead of time. Last year when they all went to Hawaii they told me during Christmas that they had bought tickets and didn't actually go until July. I said multiple times that I would like to go, even offered to pay for it, but they said no and that it was their vacation. They would talk about it all the time, how excited they were to go, what they were going to do when they got there, etc. even had a family meeting about it where everyone who was going came over to our house to talk and plan. I ended up getting mono right before they left in July, so I guess it worked out that I stayed home in the end. But leading up to that was pretty awful. "
"Can you bring in your mother, or anyone else? Legit, your sister is deluded and might even have mental fricking issues if she can't stop herself from doing that shit. I would unblock your ex to say some shit like ""We are never going to get back together. Please stop. Goodbye"" and then proceed to permanently ghost him on everything under the sun. Additionally, if your sister is still somehow so deranged that she can't stop that shit, I would probably block her out on everything and put some space inbetween you and her.

This is a terrible situation for you and it seems like you've had a lot of friction with her growing up. You are 100% in the right for getting away from your ex and he is right in trying to get someone far out if his league (I.E. YOU!) to be his girlfriend. Keep doing you and minimize the impact of your sister to fuck your life, hiding your own personal shit from her if necessary."
Not when you're married and your wife finds it disrespectful. Come on. 
"You want monogamy, he wants an open relationship. It's as simple as that. He's trying to manipulate you into letting him fuck others without feeling guilty. Seems like a clear cut case of what to do here if you ask me.

Edit: And I want to add that it's pretty fucking slimey of him to try to turn a monogamous relationship into an open relationship when I assume it was considered monogamous from the start and he knew that didn't work for him.

Edit:

&gt;  I don't want him to have to give up this really important thing to him

Lol like you're asking him to give up a prized possession from his grandmother. "
"It's highly unlikely they took the time to stop and add a condom but couldn't have stopped because they got carried away.  I'd say OP isn't getting the whole truth here.  There should be no wedding, either way."
"Bingo. My ex was the same as OP, so he got an old couch for his room and we would cuddle etc in his bed until it was time for his bedtime routine, at which point I would move to the couch. In the mornings he'd come scoop me up and let me back in his bed as soon as he woke up. "
"I think that you may be overreacting because of one thing - she said she's afraid of mice. Now, when people are afraid, they don't act rationally or with poise. They say and do things that they normally wouldn't because fear turns into panic and panic turns into outward reactions. While you are absolutely right in being upset with the situation, I think you should try to understand that she probably didn't mean to offend you and was just scared. The fact that she told you to not bring it near her just suggests that she was out of her comfort zone and simply needed to be away from your beloved pet. And it's unfortunate but I just don't think she meant to offend you. An apology would be nice, but having an open discussion with her about it might be better and save the relationship you have with her."
"HE'S YOUR HUSBAND. 

There is no ""my money"" and ""his money."" It's all ""our money."" I'm completely blown away that you two are married and don't see that. He wouldn't be contributing unequally because it's an investment for your family (you and him) to live in."
"Them paying for your schooling is pointless if they torpedo your whole life. How can you study, work, apply for jobs, concentrate, LIVE, if this crap is going on.

I have no idea how much cash we are talking about here, but it's not worth it. You need to move well away from all of them. The only good thing they have said is their suggestion to change your surname: it's a great suggestion: yes, do it, and DONT TELL THEM your new name or address. Make it your final breach from them.

TLDR Run. its not worth it"
This guy isn't your friend. Do you have any others you could reach out to? Maybe an infertility support group? I am sorry you are in this situation. 
"&gt; I keep saying to my husband that I'm upset about what would have happened to the dog if it hadn't been for my parents going over to my house in the day time.

Not 100% sure everyone will get how serious this is, if they've never had animals, but this was my first thought as I started to read your post. She risked the life of your pet over ... what ? Like seriously, what in the fuck did she even want out of this, when she didn't do jack shit ?

To me it seems she knew she'd dump this chore on your parents, and just want to bask in the glory and praise of a *job well done*.

So let's reword this situation: She put your pet's life at a very real risk of dying, for attention.

She is a shit person, nothing else to it. Don't let her back in your life, except at arms length."
"&gt;The dogs are already here with us and his mother is on holiday

&gt;  so I can't really say i'm busy now.

You've missed the point. These two things are NOT related. 
You're telling the child that you currently call your partner that YOU have other plans and that if these dogs need to be taken care of they are HIS responsibility. Here is your script:

""I'm not watching your mother's dogs I have other plans doing XYZ, these dogs are your responsibility, take them camping with you for all I care, I will not be bothered by this. End of discussion"" 

then do NOT apologize. 

You’re being taken advantage of, stand up for yourself. The fact that this is even a post speaks volumes. I’m sure that this is a constant theme; him just assuming you’ll take care of his responsibilities. I think this is a pretty good time to draw the line in the sand. 

Good luck. 
Don’t forget to update all of us with how you stood up for yourself and what happened. 

"
"I understand wanting to put the genie back in the bottle and having things go back to the way they were. But there's no going back. He stayed in the closet for years and he just became more and more miserable and so did you. As painful and scary as it is, you need to work together and find a path forward that is best for your kids."
"Your partner made his choice. It wasn't you.   If you cave now, you'll be living with the brother for the rest of your life.  So, make your choice knowing that.  He will never, ever put your needs over his brother. "
"You could start with little rules like, if you're both home, one person cooks, one person cleans. But ultimately your husband needs to realize, the behavior you exhibit during the school year is mostly because of necessity, and when that necessity is no longer there he NEEDS to pick up and make up for that when he can. That comes on him and other then having a genuine conversation about it that makes him realize he is your partner, and you are ont his maid, this isn't going to change."
"Ok first of all, this is obviously totally unfair to you.

Tell your parents you are going to call child protective services if they don't figure out an appropriate way for your brother to be supervised.  You are a 14-year-old child yourself.  You can babysit for an evening or an afternoon here and there but you are NOT equipped to deal with him on a daily basis.  It's a harmful situation for you, and a neglectful situation for your brother.

IMO your brother needs a child psychologist.  He's acting out in a severe way, probably over the divorce, and he needs some real attention.  He seems like a complete afterthought.

I might suggest you talk to your Grandma / Aunt about whether you can stay with them for a while, without your brother.  "
"I'd say you're right, and he's gotten into her head. It's a decent bet she said something about your warnings about your relationship with J, and now he's love-bombing her and making you out to be his ""crazy ex."" She probably won't give any credence to anything you tell her right now.

If you value her as a friend, you could try reaching out one last time with something like, ""I'm really worried about you. If you need someone who will listen and support you in the future, please don't hesitate to contact me."" But for the time being, I think you're going to have to stand back. Much as you might want to keep her from being hurt by J the way you were, you can't live her life for her."
"
It sounds like the relationship between you and your ex wasn't meant to last but only continued due to becoming pregnant.

Now that you are both with new people. You should be thrilled to know the father of your child married someone who cares for your daughter like her own. Would you rather her have a stereotypical mean stepmother?


See a therapist or a counselor to work through these feelings in order to keep a healthy relationship between everyone involved.
"
"You have no idea how heartwarming this is to read. You are a damn good man doing right by your son, and I guarantee you he will always remember the way you stood up for him and what's right. Your son is fucking lucky to have such a strong, caring father who will protect him when he needs it the most. *Awesome* job. I know this cannot be easy for you, and that just goes to prove the depth of your love for your son.

I think in these types of situations, usually one parent is content to let the other parent damage the child emotionally. The fact that you're not going to allow that to happen is such a great comfort to someone who is worried for your son's wellbeing. You should take pride in the loving example of acceptance which you're setting for others."
Oh wow this worked out so well. Sorry for all the shit you had to deal with to get to this point. It seems like you and Lana will have an amazing friendship from here on out. 
"One thing led to another.No it didn't,he let a prostitute pull down his trousers and suck his penis until he ejaculated.This is the man who wants you to marry him.You only have his word he wore a condom.
You only have his word it was only a blowjob.You only have his word it only happened once.
He has shown you how much his word is worth."
"&gt; She is usually good about my uncles since she knows they are idiots and everyone else knows that, but she didn't hold it in on this. She hates them. She wants nothing to do with them.

Shes told you it is at that point already. She made it clear that your uncles are a deal breaker for her. Having them around means you pick them over her. You have to grow a spine and tell your uncles to fuck off before your fiance leaves you.

&gt; My fiancée told me if I can't learn this then we have a problem because I'll cross boundaries with other people too.

Shes already losing trust for you over this, OP. Youre throwing red flags up everywhere, and she is seeing them. It will not be long before she has had enough and has to leave you."
"Not to mention the fact that he's been unfaithful in the past. It just **screams** of projection.

Get outta there, like, yesterday."
$900 a month for groceries for 3 people?  That is ridiculous.  Nope. Your bf and his roommie are taking advantage of you to fund their hobby and their food profligacy.  Talk with the OP and say this isn't working for you.  Offer to chip in $150.
"I bet no one NEEDS to see them and it's more curiosity about what he said. Seeing people's screen shots of drama or weirdness is interesting/piques curiosity of most people I imagine. If you were my best friend I would still want to see the messages. In fact, I would demand it. But that for sure doesn't mean I would believe what that reject said about you. Don't worry, lady, you're solid ❤️

Edit: peaks/piques thang "
"&gt;What do I do?

You dump her. 

She's proven to you that she's a bad person, and an awful girlfriend. What else is she going to demand of you next? It's an absolutely ridiculous ultimatum and frankly really embarrassing behavior for a 20 year old. "
"Leave her alone. You have received a C&amp;D from a lawyer. If you try to contact her again, she will take steps to get a restraining order.

She doesn't want to be in touch.

I think you also need to understand that she doesn't need ""forgiveness"" for ""ghosting"" you, and you and your family aren't being magnanimous in offering. You are instead being remarkably tone-deaf. She doesn't want you. Leave her alone."
Advice? Open the message. 
"Yeeeah this whole situation was incredibly stupid. 

If my SO said something like that to me I would be thinking the same thing: ""what exactly do you mean *we've*??"" 

He meant it as a compliment clearly, but it was almost a backhanded complement. 

OP shouldn't have asked a question she didn't want an answer to, but he kind of put her in a losing situation. Either she asks the question or she lets the question eat away at her. "
"YOur wife's family fucked up. They deserve to be treated the way they are and tbh I hope that your wife's cousin never forgives them. Tell them as a final and probably only gift to her, they can respect her wishes and stay away. "
"Awkward yes, but you were sincere.

Maddy, on the other hand, was insincere as hell. Her parents may or may not have been complicit...as Jake's parents may have been. If they were, that's really awful. 

They would be the ones that need to provide apologies to you (and Jake), not the other way around."
"She got herself into trouble when she put you in the position where you needed to do this for your own safety. 

If you can, look at it as a way to guarantee that she will leave you alone forever: she had the opportunity to do so without any police involvement. She is not only making it impossible for you to avoid it, by taking your keys, but she had every chance to avoid it. 

She chose this, and if it helps to recognize it, this may be what leads to her getting an intervention and treatment that allows her to stop being an abusive and violent person. In a way, you are doing her a favor as much as protecting yourself. 

Next time she might end up with a manslaughter charge instead, whether the death is yours or someone else's. Someone like her escalates, and she doesn't have much farther to go past this before she's there. There's people who've died from one punch to the face. She's just lucky you weren't one of those."
He's already going to be special and different on some level because he's going to have to deal with surgery and medicine and the hospital. So he'll get more attention while he's dealing with that. The best possible thing the parents can do is what they are doing- treating him like a totally normal kid the rest of the time. It's the best chance he has of retaining normalcy and his sisters not building a grudge against him for the extra attention that naturally comes from being the sick kid. 
"I, too, love this app, but there is not actually a way to play it for that many minutes without spending real money on it. That's actually something I *like* about it, because having to wait for stamina to recharge means my play time is automatically limited. 

Since she agrees that it's a problem, ask her to let you set up a restriction on in-app purchases for that app (so she won't know the passcode to bypass it), and she'll be able to play it but only for a few minutes at a time with hours in between sessions. Hopefully she'll get tired of it when she can't obsess over it as much."
You can't make her do it. But you're well in your right to break up with her over it. Sex is a big part of being in a relationship so you ought to find someone you're compatible with sexually. 
"Restraining order. Like, yesterday."
"I hate parrots and have broken up with a girl for much the same reasons you describe. This will not be the last time it causes problems in your dating life. They are possessive bastards who generally make a misery of everyone's life except their owner.

All that said, your boyfriend sounds like a complete jerk. Tormenting and abusing an animal is not on, regardless of how much you dislike it. I agree that he's showing you a very ugly side to him. I would absolutely break up with someone who did this shit.

If you're still determined to try and make this work, an ultimatum about the parrot staying and his behaviour improving is necessary. But I doubt you'll succeed - his lack of interest in befriending the bird speaks volumes."
"This. I'd also add that you should check out wayfair.com and ikea and the NYC craigslist to see if there are some items that it would be cheaper to buy there instead of pay to move... Especially if you are moving to a smaller place in NYC, some of your furniture might be missized for the space."
"Ha, when we moved toward the week d of my time in high school, my mother said that they would buy a queen sized bed for my room, because it would be useful as a guest room and 'if I came home with a future spouse', as opposed to bf/husband etc. 

I had (and still have) not given any indication of being anything but straight, but I think that was a nice low key comment / phrasing to indicate acceptance without pushing anything. "
"HA nonono, that's some bullshit. You don't get to basically tell someone they're going to do you a favor and *then* ask them if they will. For real, don't let him guilt you for his mistake. (:"
"But he doesn't mind doing *an hour* on weekends ::eye roll::

Dude. An hour a week is no where near what a house with kids takes. I don't know why she doesn't want a cleaning service except that maybe she needs to see him take *some* responsibility. No idea if that's their vibe, that's just my thoughts. "
"The first thing you are going to do is talk to a lawyer about your relative's estate. You are going to want to save some things for your nephew [pictures, some clothing, his fathers watches, jewelry his mother has] for him when he is older. He is going to want to have some things, including clothing to wear. 

Make sure he has his room and his toys set up at your sister's house. 

You will want to make sure you all support him. He will need therapy, eventually, and it will take some time. If your SIL is willing to take him, support her by offering to babysit and be consistent in the child's life. 

If you can, make sure to visit and call on a schedule. It will help to have a schedule for him."
I got soooooooo many eharmony emails when I was no longer active on it. Nbd. 
"Sounds like it's way past time to end it.
Just do it. You're going to cry, it'll be sad and then you will feel the biggest sense of relief going forward. You are far too young to settle for this.


"
"There's a point of ridiculousness where such a low amount can become a protest, and it will be interpreted as an insult. I don't think it's a bad idea at all, especially if their mother is in on the crazy."
"&gt; They say things that everyone else is thinking"".

Your boyfriend thinks like him too, he just knows better than to do it in front of you. I'm sorry.
"
"&gt; She wants kids, and I decidedly do not. I have told her that numerous times from very early on, but she thinks I'll change my mind

There's nowhere to go from here.  You need to sit down like an adult, not with gaming or bravo or whatever in the background, and tell her you will never have kids, you would be willing to get a vasectomy tomorrow.

Be very, very clear.  Not wishy wash pushover like the rest of your life.  There are things that can't be fixed with compromise, this is one."
No I've seen 10 years old bring their sick mom breakfast in bed. This is clearly a toddler.
Even after everything they did to her this woman had the willpower and and dignity to not interfere with her son's relationships with the family. Can't even explain how much I respect that and her and how much contempt I have for OP's family. 
"Exactly. She won't see it for what it is because of the specifics of who is involved. Abuse is abuse period, and her staying silent and continuing to associate with her friend like nothing is going on is pretty shitty. I think this is one of those times where you need to be blunt with your partner and tell her exactly how you feel. You do not need to hang around with someone who slaps their wife."
"I just moved to Brooklyn last month. OP, I don't have kids yet, but if you're in the market for new friends or just need a friendly face to talk to let me know!"
"The problem isn't your hair, the problem is your moms attitude to your hair. You didn't do anything wrong. You shouldn't have felt the need to wear a wig. "
"he's not supposed to be having fun... he's being disciplined. 

the 10 minutes is supposed to be spent thinking about what he did and why it was the wrong reaction so that next time he makes a different choice.

its not clear if he grabbed the toy during that time or after that time, but either way it's not time for a reward! that would send very mixed messages. 

she is trying to send the message ""cause trouble, lose privileges. if you don't like those consequences, think of them before you act."" 

you are trying to send the message ""you should never have to be bored no matter what.""

bad idea.

maybe you thought it was too harsh, but there is probably a context you don't know about. this may not have been the first time. she has to show consistency, and increasing punishment for repetitive problems. if you think its too much, bring it up with her when he's not around. you undermined her authority, she didn't have time to deal with both of you so you had to go. 

if your primary interaction with the kid has been fun stuff, and you haven't seen the discipline before, its understandable that you could be caught off guard. 

tell her you understand that it was poor timing and you won't do it again. then ask what issues she's been working on with him, and how its going, so you learn some context for why she might react certain ways to things you wouldn't see as obviously troubling.

"
Exactly. OP she wants to fuck your boyfriend and she isn't even trying to hide it.
"This sounds like the makings of a reality TV show. What a bunch of awful, vapid people.

You should turn your mom's ""But she's your siiiiister!"" bullshit right back around on her. After all, if your sisterly bond is so important to your mother, why should you have to pay to participate? She should include you in her bridal party by default."
"The fact that he's comfortable bringing her around is a good sign. If you're not involved in biking, it'd be pretty easy for him to keep his relationship with her a complete secret. On the flip-side, it's a little irksome that he is making you out to be unreasonable for your concerns. Regardless of his actual feelings, he can surely see what it *looks* like from the outside. 

You'll have to look at this from the larger context of your relationship to see if it's really a problem, though. Is he still making time for you and your children, or is he spending the majority of his free time with her and/or neglecting his domestic responsibilities? Is he giving his friend access to your children (e.g. unsupervised play time, bringing them to outings, etc) without discussing with you first? Does he have a pattern of telling you your feelings and/or distrust of his actions are ""unreasonable""? Is he being truthful about the amount of time he is spending alone with her vs. in a group? Is he open to you joining them or is he evasive about it (e.g. coming up with reasons why you wouldn't/couldn't do it)? 

If you're satisfied with the answers to those questions, I'd let it go. He may be enjoying her attention, but it's probably pretty platonic and benign. If you have other warning bells going off though, then I'd be more concerned. Either way, I think you're within your rights to sit him down and discuss boundaries, so you avoid any potential ""I didn't think that [clearly flirtatious behavior] would bother you!"" conversations later."
"Yup, that's clear after seeing his messages. I wish I realized that and he was honest before I was four months into my pregnancy. 

I'll look into my local planned parenthood and their services, thank you. I don't think I can get an abortion with them though. I think I'd have to have a D&amp;C and I don't know if they perform them."
"""It's a bad mix when all of our kids get together. We love you two, and if you want to get together without kids we'd enjoy that.  But getting the whole family together just isn't working out well."" 

Followed by:

""I'm really sorry we avoided you instead of talking to you about it directly. We were embarrassed and unsure what to say, and I realize that was unkind to you. I hope you can forgive us for that; we value your friendship and acknowledge we didn't handle things well.""

Don't tell them they are bad parents. Even if they are, it's not like your comment is going to change anything. It will just make them dig in deeper and further isolate themselves. "
"As a Deaf and hard of hearing advocate, her reaction truly offended me. There are things you can do should your hearing ever get to that point to improve communication between rooms (such as flashing the lights, making use of the disability aids on your cellphone that includes the flash on your phone going off when ringing or texts come through). But, honestly, if that is how she feels? You should leave her. That's my honest opinion. Albeism is a real thing and it is just as bad as any bigotry slander. If she can't accept you for you, then she shouldn't be with you. I once dated someone who was deaf in one ear. You learn to work around it."
"&gt; she is traveling to see family

Are you sure about that?  My ex pulled that one one me too, it was despicable how he used his mother's cancer as cover for his weekends away with his lover.  You already know she's lying to you, what you don't know is how deep that hole goes."
"You sound like a nightmare in terms of being the girlfriend in these situations. She's a new girlfriend, you show up at his house ""in a mood"", completely ignore her, insult her passive aggressively (""what's this one's name?""), and leave without talking to her.

Then she's left out and ignored because you guys are ""having a fab time"" at a festival *she is also at*, to the extent her new beau is ignoring her messages completely in order to hang out with you. 

My SO has primarily female friends. I really don't think that he's dating jealous girl after jealous girl. But I would be insecure and annoyed if his best friend treated me (or rather...didn't) the way both you, and he while around you, do.

He needs to recognize that yes, he is indeed putting you before them, and that's very obvious even from a post coming from your side. You need to think about what it would feel like getting to know someone intimately whose closest relationship is a girl that clearly devalues his relationships because he's frequently in them. You aren't even giving them a chance. "
"One thing to understand here is that while you are well-acquainted with your addiction and how it is woven into your life, your wife is only just now getting her head around the reality of you being an addict.  Looking back at every decision you have made and interaction you have shared, trying to make sense of the person she thought she knew and the side of you that she did not see or realize had been there.  While she may have been good in the moment of being told, reality set in as she took the time to start processing what you had told her.  The danger your addiction placed you, her, and your child into as well as the ways in which your addiction may have been taking away from your lives together already.  Processing those consequences and trying to make sense of how you could be a part of her life going forward takes more than a single conversation.  It's going to take time if she does ever become open to the possibility of trusting you again to get close to her.

Telling her though was as much about helping her as helping you.  You're out now.  You've admitted you need help.  Yes, you've flipped your life upside down, but at least you did it ahead of someone else flipping it for you.  Your wife, a friend, the police, or the reaper.  Someone else was going to make you face the reality of your addiction, but at least in you doing it yourself, you can better manage the consequences of that realization."
"I suggest speaking to other family as well. I have a mother with a personality disorder who would exclude me from family vacations in college bc they would pick these outrageously expensive(think 1k+ per person per week for a beach house) vacations and she was apparently embarrassed I couldn't afford them and wouldn't even let me contribute a small amount and crash on one of the many couches or extra beds.

After I went no contact I found out from my grandma no one had any idea she was doing this to me and would have intervened if they had. I only got suspicious the last year when my younger cousins went off to college and none of them were paying but still got to come."
"So my best friend met this guy who lives 5 hours away. I know he lived with his mom, or at least that's what he told her. He decides to take a bus to visit my friend. The plan was he was just going to visit her over the weekend, see if they hit it off... well, he never left. He was super nice to her, always doing nice things for her, so she fell hard for him. He didn't work the first month. Supposedly, he was job hunting. When he finally found a job, it was barely enough to help with rent. He wasn't helping her financially in any way. Finally about 6 months later she dumped him and she had to buy him a ticket back home because he was broke. He tried coming back once. He even broke into her apartment. It was crazy. We eventually found out he did the same thing with another girl not even two weeks later. We call these men ""hobosexuals"". I'm telling you this so you'll be weary. This guy is more than likely going to try leeching off of you. Also... don't let strangers into your place. 

EDIT: Update us please? I really hope you take my advice."
"Ah thanks! That's true. You're right. I'll try to grow a pair. 

I said ""But you didn't even ask?"" and he said ""Sorry, I'm asking now. Can I?"" Like... 

"
"Yes. OP, which of these is the best worst-case scenario:

(1) You get married so young, and there's a notable possibility that you realize you're not right for each other, and are unhappy / without growth

(2) You get married so young, and there's a notable possibility that you realize you're not right for each other, and get a divorce

(3) You don't get married for another few years until you've both had time to learn what the other is like as an adult, which means waiting a few years for sex

(4) You have sex now without getting married.


I recognize none of those 4 situations are ideal, but you sort of have to pick your poison. If you're itching to have sex now: **Is it worse to have sex before marriage, or to risk a divorce?** No one right answer - different people have different faiths and ideologies about that. But you have to be realistic and decide which one you want to risk."
"Even more so, it’s unacceptable whether she even has a boyfriend or not"
He is acting like it now. So you might want to point it out to him if he isn't listening.
"I was the biggest slop when I lived alone. As embarassing as it is to admit, I have no issue in living with filth. That is until someone would be visiting, it became a habit of mine to invite my girlfriend, when I thought I needed to clean my apartment, because the fear of her seeing what an orc I was, was enough for me to make an effort.

You've been with the person for a year. If a part of you still really likes him, then give him a chance and talk with him. But be very clear in how serious you are with this."
"You mentioned the last thing you ever wanted was for your son to be gay, but I don't think thats true. I think the last thing you would ever want is for him to kill himself and to be blunt your wife's treatment of him and his current school/church environment increase the likelihood of that happening significantly.

I can see that while you are really struggling with this that you love your son and are trying to be accepting within your current framework. Please do not even consider any gay conversion ""treatments"". They are psychological torture and their outcomes are devastating. Please continue to stand by your son and show him love and acceptance."

"No, she is in absolute all-encompassing MASSIVE denial. To the point of denying clear reality. She's basically gone ""La la la, can't hear you!""

We've all asked her what she thinks happened if it wasn't him, and she said ""it's unexplained."" I won't post details but suffice to say unless someone broke into her house WHILE HE WAS HOME and he somehow didn't notice, it was 100% him. "
"Ok, here are some things you could have done if you truly cared about your baby's comfort: 

You were wearing a nice warm jacket, right?  Take off the jacket and wrap the baby in it.  Yeah, you'd be cold, but better you than the baby - at least that's what you'd be thinking if you truly cared about the baby's comfort.  

You were nice and warm, right?  Pick up the baby and snuggle him and wrap both of you in the jacket.  Again, if the baby is a person you love, you'd care about him being comfortable, right?

The fact that none of these things even occurred to you, and that you were just fine leaving a tiny baby to freeze until he was whimpering from discomfort, is why your wife kicked you out.  If I were in her shoes, I'd kick you out too.  "
"Completely off! I also think it's your BIL's and his families responsibility to tear this guy a new one.  It's beyond inappropriate, and if he's done it to you, I imagine he's done it before, and will do it again."
"&gt; But that's just not the world you're living in. Those aren't the parents that you have.

"Don't even bother to threaten to call the police.  

if you want this to be over do this...

DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.  

document the times this guy has shown up unwanted.  document his texts, document his calls.  

Document that he has no rights to the dog.  Document it all.  


then take a drive down to the courthouse or wherever your state/area allows you to petition for a protective order.  

then you fill out the petition for the protective order.  


here's how this works in quick detail.  

You will become the petitioner.  your Ex will become the respondent.  

a sheriff will give him a summons to court for a protective order.  You will show up on that court date with all of your documented harassment by him.  

You will be calm and show the judge everything the ex has done to get to you.  

if he shows up the judge is going to grant you a PO.  

if he doesn't show up the judge is going to grant you a PO merely by failure to appear.  




you honestly have nothing to lose, this guy is a closed chapter in your life and he's continuing to go out of his way to contact you and harass you.  this is why protective orders exist.  


if he violates the protective order, he goes to jail.  




it's not about the dog, it's a obsession with you and you should protect yourself.  



I know most people wont wanna go through these measures but this system exists because of shit like this.  The judge will see through all of his bullshit and all of his lies and will grant you a PO.   


it's completely safe too.  there will be very minimal people in the room it'll be you, the judge, whomever you decide to bring with you and maybe some cops.  there's not people hanging out.  only the judge hears and deals with it.

"Piggybacking off of this because I see DV people get off all the time at my current internship and it enrages me. 

OP, I am so sorry and I can't imagine how hard this is. You DO NOT deserve to be treated that way. He has probably been ordered by the court not to contact you, and you should report his attempts to contact you to the prosecutor. Do you have a victims rights advocate? You should get in contact with them, they may be able to help you get into some counseling services or just be supportive. 

""Pressing charges"" is frequently misunderstood. The victim does not choose whether to ""press charges."" Charges are brought by the prosecutors office. However, they frequently cannot proceed if the victim does not want to testify. It is 110% your choice. However, this will almost definitely not be his last DV/assault and battery/etc. charge. 

If you choose to testify against him, you will prevent him from doing this to anyone in the future. If you are afraid for your safety, you may be able to get a protection order. "
"Given the guy's record, is tact even called for. Just say, you find him unacceptable as a care giver and that what just happened cannot be allowed to happen again. You might want to mention calling the authorities if it does happen again. 

If they cringe, leave. This is more important than Julia's feelings and Her  Your BIL's &amp; Julia's actions with their own children is suspect. As parents, none of the 4 of you can afford to be in denial. 

If nothing else, this Greg, is guilty of massively poor judgement and lack of character which alone makes him unfit as a caregiver."

"&gt; I can be very selfish, often dramatic, abrupt, and pretentious. I have a hard time giving control to other people.

Unfortunately these are really off putting traits. I suggest continuing to work on them. Part of the thing with being an adult and having adult friends is you dont have to put up with traits people have you dont like.

I suggest exploring a hobby or sport, thats a good way to make friends in my experiences. Work isnt always a great place either."
"I hadn't considered the fact that she already owes me money before sitting down to write this post. I am going to draw up a household budget this evening and sit down with her, her reaction to that is going to say a lot. She keeps mentioning how we can split the cost, but I don't think she realizes that if we can't afford it outright in cash then we shouldn't finance anything that isn't absolutely needed."
"&gt; I think I figured out my boyfriend has a cross dressing fetish and I'm not sure how to address it or if I even should.

You stated that the fetish itself doesn't bother you and you believe your boyfriend is entitled to his privacy, but you also stated that you're ""uncomfortable ignoring it...considering my last relationship"" on the basis that ""secrets breed contempt and distrust."" These statements seem to contradict each other. 

There's no right or wrong answer here. You have the right to demand more transparency in the relationship, but your boyfriend doesn't have to meet that demand. On the other hand, if you decide not to address what you saw but still feel uncomfortable about the situation, it could negatively impact your relationship.

Ultimately, you're going to have to work through your feelings and decide what matters most to you."
"Hey OP, can he breathe through his nose? Does he snore? Does he have colds/sinus problems/allergies ever? I used to eat like this as a kid + teenager and it turned out 95% of the airway in my nose was blocked. Trying to simultaneously eat and mouth breathe just doesn't work well and makes a ton of noise.

"If you don't have the willpower to be faithful, you need to end the relationship you are in. If you care and respect your bf, you should be able to handle living with an attractive person. 

Stop flirting with him, treat him like he doesn't exist and don't spend any time with him alone. Crushes fade when you don't feed them. If you respect your bf at all it shouldn't be that hard, especially if you love your bf. 

If you haven't told your bf about this, you're already crossing lines. "
"Not being able to see your son isn't a consequence of telling her, it's a consequence of using drugs and lying about it.  You have no options right now, if you ever want to see your son, except to do what she asks, get clean, and not make a fuss.  Shea protecting her child...from you...because you're an unreliable drug user.  You have no right to be upset with her protecting her child."
"You thought she was taking advantage of you and, once you got the full story, you ended up helping to rescue her from an abusive relationship. Kudos."
"She can drop them off without prepaying. At most dog hoarding facilities, you pay on pick up. She should list her boyfriend's contact information on all of the forms and tell the staff she is just dropping off for him. Then, she can move all her shit out of the house while he's gone and leave a note with the address and phone number of the boarding facility."
"Yeah, what are her other options here?

*Leave the can there until he cleans it up on the weekend, which makes the house gross and unlivable

*Wait a day to see if he throws it out, and then ask him to clean it up, which annoys him because she's ""nagging"" and unfairly puts her in charge of micromanaging him and his can

*Just do it herself without complaining, since she's the one bothered by it, which happens to be the most direct and helpful action, but somehow it BOTHERS him"

Honestly not worth it girl. Only 4 months and this much drama? You don't feel like you can trust him. On to the next.
"I agree that for now tithe is not the problem.

I earn considerably more than my partner and still only have $100 a week to spend on miscellaneous and even that is generous compared to a lot of friends. There has to be a small bill or two that she can be solely responsible for and you should definitely never have to put in for uniforms or other school costs. 

My cousin and his wife were struggling financially some years ago and were contemplating separating just so she could get some sort of welfare and then he found out she'd been paying tithing the entire time. Be aware that she will commit to that no matter what her income is and that's okay as long as she's pulling her wait at hole too. "
"1. find everything of his that you have and put it somewhere neutral find everything of yours that he has and take it back. This will stop any unecessary communication
2. Change all of your passwords and make them more secure. Social media is a big means of revenge for this sort of person
3. Practice what to say and literally don't even listen to his responses. If he's the typical smart sociopath he will come up with some good lies
4. If you're going to do this in person, do it somewhere neutral possibly with somebody you trust nearby
5. Dump him and then leave ASAP to minimize danger"
"Yeah, he's obsessed with *looking* like the selfless, forgiving guy and because OP is his partner, he wants her to uphold and feed into that image. Ugh."
"Oh boy, this reminds me of my sister. Manipulative as shit and a burden on everyone. I still talk to her in family dinner, but no contacts otherwise.   
I'd say thank her, she made it easier to go no contact, enjoy your life, it will be better without her in it."
"Did she ask you for feedback? 

If no then leave her alone"
"You're right on the money. If anything, socializing him with other children his age will probably help him to overcome his timid and shy nature. I'm also not exactly sure what they think he will do. Do they think that by being around a shy three-year-old their kids will close up and become shy too? That's crazy. "
"There is a saying that if you need a favor, ask your busiest friends. This is because people that don't do much during the day see even the smallest activities like massive hurtles. If you catch me on a workday and ask me to drop something off at the post office, no problem, i'm already out and about. But if i'm having a lazy Saturday, going to the post office seems like a massive chore. 

He probably internally downplayed the effort you made since you were already out. And, yours wouldn't be the first relationship where one partner feels entitled to certain benefits &amp; attitudes because they provide most of the income. 

Even if your husband inherited millions, you should encourage him to do something with his time. Maybe get on the board of a nonprofit to get him active. "
"I can see how someone might say ""wow, I thought I only liked X, but you're Y and I'm super into you, isn't that crazy?"" because they're awkwardly trying to compliment you while also discovering that X is not as important to them in practice as they thought it was in theory.

But this guy *keeps bringing up your height* as a negative quality and emphasising how much he's magnanimously going out of his way to overlook it. I'm getting a creepy negging vibe from this. It sounds like he's trying to lower your self-esteem and make you feel like you're starting off at a disadvantage, so that you feel that you need to ""make up for"" your ""deficiency"".

He could genuinely believe that he is incapable of being attracted to short women (I find this kind of filter incomprehensible, but I can believe that different people are wired differently), and genuinely be making a good faith attempt to overcome it. I don't know if that's better or worse -- I don't know if it's worth it for you to participate in someone's earnest boner experiment when you have feelings for them that go beyond the desire for a once-off hookup."
"Yes, that is what basically happened. Sorry if it was not clear in the post."
"&gt; Now it feels like he's trying to turn the tables and make it seem like it's my fault. Should I stay or should I go?

"Ask her point blank which will hurt her public image more, divorce or counseling.  Maybe you could find someone in a different town for counseling."
"I know it's easier said than done, but this doesn't have to be a humiliating experience. I'm not dismissing your feelings (you have every right to feel however you feel). Rather, I encourage you to focus on your responsibilities. YOU are not responsible for him getting another woman pregnant. YOU are not responsible for him choosing to leave. He's responsible, and perhaps, he should be feeling humiliated.

You are responsible for taking care of yourself so you can have a healthy pregnancy. You are responsible to make sure your children know everyday how loved they are. The world is complicated and ""normal"" families (husband, wife, and 2.5 kids or whatever) aren't as common. Your kids and his other child may have questions eventually, but it's more important that they know how loved they are than the genogram mapping of how they are related.

You show strength by coming on here and posting, and I know you will get through this sucky situation with your husband with strength and grace."
"I think the fact that divorce isn't an option would be even more of a cause for concern from their perspective. 

I also believe that there very much is merit in what your mother is saying. I would take her words to heart and genuinely consider what she is saying to you. If you've done that, you've gone through the scenarios in your head and tried to place yourself in those mindsets and you still want to be married... Absolutely do it. Let your mother know that you've taken the time to carefully consider her concerns and have found that you are still at peace with your decision. 

Once you've told her that, she (and your other family members) will either accept your feelings or they won't. Continue inviting them to be a part of your proceedings unless they begin trying to sabotage or ruin your happiness. Place them at a polite distance if that is the case. 

And please, for the love of all that is good in the world, don't get married just so you can fuck one another. If you're as devout to your faith as you say you are, ""temptation"" doesn't mean shit. Be responsible for the limitations you're placing on your lives. If divorce is not an option, you'd better have a damn good reason to get married. Sex is not on that list, I'd say. Especially because the two of you could turn out to be sexually incompatible, anyway. 

Edit: I think it's also worth considering that unless you're pregnant or just want to skip to the sex, your mom might be wondering what the rush is. It's probably worth considering that and mulling that over, too. Why the rush?"
"It's because your mother doesn't and has never done all these controlling things for your good at all. For her, it is all about her need to have full control over you. My jaw dropped as I read your post. She's insane and you need to be vigilant about setting boundaries. She's probably taught you growing up that you don't have a right to any and that's very dangerous way to be as an adult. You need to save up, and move out ASAP. Because your mother is doing this to you for her own selfish wants, not your own good, she will not listen to any reason if you try and talk to her about it so don't bother. Your freedom will not be given, you must seize it and fight for it."
"&gt; I don't get why she wants to meet up! I do not want her in my life she is toxic.

So she can sell you stuff. Presumably you said no by text, phone, and email. In person, she can apply greater pressure.

Just block her if you don't need to stay in contact. If you think it'll matter, politely decline and then stop responding to messages."
"1. You need to acknowledge that your son could have been hurt or killed because you weren't paying attention.

2. You need to acknowledge that you AND your wife would have been reported to Child Protective Services for neglect if anyone other than yourself and your wife had found him wandering around by himself.

3. You need to actively decide whether you want to have a relationship with your son that includes playing games and activities that pique HIS interests, not yours. 

4. Once you have decided on steps 1-3, you need to fucking call everyone you think knows where your wife is and find her asap. Show up and beg on your fucking knees if you have to. "
He sounds like the type that would forgive a friend for being rude to OP and then get mad at her for not letting it go. 
I'm pregnant and if my husband said he believed there to be a 1% chance that I had betrayed him I would be so freaking hurt I don't think I would ever recover.
"I've only had sex when I was in love. Or at least, cared about them and knew that they were special to me. Love occurs on a spectrum. I'm down to fuck as soon as that seed is planted, and I'm emotionally sensitive so I feel it rather readily, am a good judge of romantic character I guess. When people hear 'in love,' they are thinking you are going to wait half a year or something, where I'd put it more along one or two months mark. Have sex when you are comfortable with it and ready to try it with someone you care about. If you put out, you simply run the risk of having sex with someone who is only interested in you putting out.  "
This is a common misconception. Do you really think it would be better to subjugate your daughter to bad influences?
"I am not an expert on Christian doctrine, and I don't know what flavor of Christianity your mom practices, but I'm pretty sure Jesus didn't blame the sick for not having enough faith. I would not tell her that you're an atheist, because I suspect she'd respond by being an even bigger asshole. 

If you can find some sort of devotional book for people with severe illness that emphasizes that it's not your fault, I'd buy it and make a big deal out of reading it. Maybe she'll pick it up herself and learn something.

Sending good vibes."
"Why would you knock up a woman so soon after meeting her, who already had 3 children, one of which is walking the road to being a little weirdo?  Condoms are a thing for a reason, my friend.

Walk out.  That's the simple solution.  Go back to your place, leave her to deal with her shitty kid.  Tell her you'll be back when he starts getting disciplined and stops being violent.  Try to get at least partial custody of your own kid when he comes and let her deal with the other 3 on her own (or with their father(s))."
"Don't bring up her family when you talk to her about it, either. Just make sure that you emphasize its your preference. "

"Former sugar baby here. I also saw /u/bestphilly offered some sound advice as well.


I was in a platonic relationship with an older man that was strictly dates only. All he wanted was to make men around him feel jealous by going out with a younger woman. He liked having a pretty girl on his arm and while he would complain about his wife at times, was extremely upfront from the beginning that he had no interest in a sexual relationship and no desire to cheat on his wife.


I did see how he had weird relationship between sex and money though. We had a nice friendship but he viewed paying someone for sex as ""cheap"" and if he were going to cheat he'd want it to be with someone he'd never have to look at again. It's weird but he did find the fact that I didn't have a price tag for sex to be... classier?


At any rate, I only saw him when I was single. I didn't want to be actively going on dates with him, even if it was only for this financial arrangement, if I was emotionally and physically invested in someone else. It felt wrong. I'd also never go out of town with him. That again is crossing a line (FOR ME) into more relationship territory.


It's absolutely okay for a man to not be comfortable with this arrangement. It is possible sex is happening, but it might not be! You have to talk to her about it and find out the truth. 


Also, I wasn't getting paid any crazy amounts. Just enough to pay bills and buy textbooks. He paid me for my time knowing I could be working a job when I was spending time with him. If she's bringing in a couple grand she either found one HELL of a sugar daddy or... sex is on the table.



Lastly, I have no regrets. I got a degree with those textbooks. No more waiting tables."
"Seriously, that would have been a perfect opportunity to offer OP help dealing with her feelings, not report her. "
I want to protect him. I want him to be happy. I want him him to be confident in who he is.
"Was going to say this, there's no reason for your ""best friend"" to have those types of conversations with your wife *and* mentioning that he gets no sex with his wife? WTF? Red flags all over the place"
"The google number is a good idea, thank you."
"&gt; I personally dont think its a bad arrengement but it has to be temporary. 

I think you are wrong. Given her current attitude, living together temporarily will only be prolonging her adjustment difficulties and could result in an even bigger blowup later. If she is high functioning, she would likely be best off trying to do her first year in residence, where she'll have some formal school support and broad access to others. Dorms or a dedicated student co-op would be the first thing I'd be looking into for her.

And you say No. You don't say ""You're welcome for a few months"" or ""Maybe for a little while."" You say No. She will always be welcome in your home *as a guest*—guests can stay for a few nights or a week maybe—but guests do not live there. Tell her how this was an important and valuable thing for you to learn when you were her age, and how you want to make sure she gets the chance to learn it as well."
"&gt; Edit: i just saw the age difference. That makes it worse that he's that immature at 30

It looks *a lot* like a power play. If OP accepts this, then it's an open road to accepting anything from him. The age difference is relevant in this case, no self-respecting 30 yo man would ever tolerate that kind of behavior, which is why he goes after younger men.

Edit: changed OP's gender. Doesn't change my point at all, though."
"""He also said he's going to make my life as difficult and unpleasant as possible in ways that the police will never be able to know about. ""

You mother should stop making this about her as well. 
"The issue is not the 10% she gives to the church. That is part of who she is and what she believes. I think the problem lies more in what she's doing with the other 90%, and the fact that the two of you didn't clearly define what her financial responsibility entails in this arrangement.

"
wow this escalated past the point of reason  
"I used to work in a government job where we did a lot of travel for work. Anywhere from two to a half dozen of us would fly somewhere, rent a single car or van, drive to a hotel together, get our separate rooms, meet up for our meals together, drive in the one car to our meetings, etc. Those trips could last from a day to several weeks.

Work wasn't going to reimburse us for two cars just because one of us did or didn't have a penis. 

Women entered the work force decades ago. By now I would have hoped we'd all gotten past the gender version of separate but equal, where we need the automotive equivalent of separate drinking fountains. "
"My go to for this is to lightheartedly say ""Oh, are we discussing each other's weight now? Let me know when it's my turn."" That usually shuts them up."
"Maybe I'm overly paranoid, but I would be pretty concerned if he hates your pet to such a degree. What if one day he just leaves the door open ""by accident"" or simply got rid of it while you're not home? I simply would not trust anyone who has demonstrated mean spirited and hostile behavior towards my pets to be around them unsupervised. "
"&gt; couldn't wait for the weekend (we could only get together over the weekend) and it wasn't uncommon to have sex about 4-6 time a single night 

Yeah, that's not sustainable or realistic for most people. 

I strongly suspect that she doesn't have nearly as high of a drive as those weekends made you think. She's probably burned out from trying to maintain that fantasy and this is the ""real"" her. If you guys are bickering at things like chores, I promise, that will kill a female sex drive in seconds.

"&gt; I want to hear whats bothering the other person, what they struggle with, I want them to want to hear mine.

For 99% of people, it takes a while to form that kind of connection to be able to share that stuff."
"&gt; No because he's not communicating with me. 

That really frustrates me to read. 

Everyone makes mistakes at work but this mistake directly affects you too. He totally needs to involve you in this conversation in terms of how this affects your finances if he needs to look for a new job. 

The incident at his work is pretty much out of your control, but do what you can to make sure your finances are in order and all that and I totally second going to  r/legaladvice 

They could totally give you some useful tips. Most likely your husband is doing what he can to save his ass at work, so hopefully he won't get fired... but he really should be involving you in what his gameplan is.

"As the daughter of a father like your husband...

You would be doing her an enormous favor if you got her out of there NOW.  She is going to have a very, very hard time forgiving you if you stay.  Trust me.

He has told you he has no intention of having a relationship with her.   Believe him and get her out of there before he does serious damage to her.  Having that rejection be up close and in person instead of millions of miles away, that is so hard to live with.

Please.   Get her, and you, out of there. "
"Think about it like this. Either you start paying her, or she stops tutoring your kid. I understand that this was really informal at first, but it sounds like you underestimated the effort it takes to get a child to understand new concepts, even if these concepts are elementary. Yes, it may seem effortless to you or a 19 year old, but your kid is struggling in math for a reason, and your niece helped him understand it better. That's something she should be commended and compensated for, especially considering she dedicated regular to semi-regular time to it. Otherwise, *you* would have been doing it. 

If you feel her tutoring was valuable enough for compensation, apologize for not offering sooner, and do it. That way you're *supporting* your family, and not taking advantage of favors. If not, then don't have her tutor. Then *you* can tutor your kid.

Edit: Contradicting things here: 

&gt;My son had been struggling with his math, in which I was never a strong suit.

and

&gt;I argued that what she was assisting in is elementary-level math and should take little effort.

So that comment toward your niece was a bit shitty of you. "
"The mother probably wouldn't want someone inexperienced with dogs to watch them, either he has to tell her he won't be around or she'll have to make other arrangements.

Either way, it's hugely irresponsible and inconsiderate of him."
"The boyfriend doesn't get it, and he's new enough that maybe you should've joked a little carefully for the first few times, oops. What a colossal miscommunication. This never should've blown up like it did and dogpiling you with his friends was a ridiculously over-the-top, yikes move.

&gt;  In Shaun's defence, he has put a facebook status in support of me and is considering ending the relationship. 

Has he actually talked to the guy, though? They need to resolve this. Shaun's got a mess to clean up now. 

He's the only one who can clarify that he didn't give a fuck about you joking about his sexuality who this dude's going to believe."
"If this is truly affecting usage of the bathroom, knock on the door so he knows someone is waiting. That's about all you should do. Monopolizing the bathroom for so long is discourteous, but not worth bringing up to HR unless you're handicapped *edit: or only comfortable using a gender neutral bathroom* and it's genuinely inconveniencing you."
"&gt;I did text her and said ""sorry it was weird, I just could be so good for you."" So far nothing from her but our friend David texted me ""your timing is horrendous bro, LOL.""

Let me break it down for you: 

* Your friend David just put you on notice.

* Word of what you said to her has spread to the rest of the group, and they're talking about it. You are now the creepy and inappropriate friend.

* You have **no shot** with *any* of these girls, and they may hesitate to even set you up with their friends..

If you want to keep these people as friends, stop being defensive or obtuse about the ill-timed pass you made at her and distant yourself for a few weeks before coming back into the fold as a *friend* only."
"You didn't get your roommates fired - they did. Assuming that everything you said about them is true, it was their own actions that got them in trouble. You just made someone aware of the actions.

Personally, I wouldn't tell you that you mentioned them in your exit interview. What you *could* do is ask if they would be interested in some of your observations, and then let them know a few things that you think are issues."
"OP definitely seems to have enough sense to know already, but please do NOT try that first ""option"".  
First and foremost, that could be a dangerous situation for OP.  Secondly, while yes the guy is at least an idiot for responding to her first texts as he did, he might not have stalked her.  A LOT of this could actually be BIL's fault.  

BIL obviously lied at least once.  Maybe he sent that stuff in group text by accident, and maybe he didn't read any of the ""loser"" replies from the group.  But the chances of both being true?  C'mon... 

I bet BIL gave bro her number, and then lied about it when she asked."
"You aren't overreacting at all.

This kind of violation of your privacy is wrong. Whatever his problem is, if he did this, he doesn't trust you, is insecure about himself or wants to control you. There's no good reason for that.

Whether you had anything embarrassing or not is irrelevant to why this is a problem. You could have had documented proof that you cheated on him and it still would have been wrong for him to do this. 

I hope you deleted this data from his hard drive and password protected your device. I also hope all your devices are password protected. 

Have you talked to him about it yet? Did he have anything to say in defense of himself? Have you ruled out any innocent excuse on his part?

Personally, I wouldn't stay with someone who did that. They clearly have trust issues for no good reason. I wouldn't blame you if you bailed. "
"OP, I agree with the other comments saying you need to have a heart-to-heart with your father, *but* I think you also need to discuss this with your mother. You're old enough to say that you're uncomfortable in these situations, and that while you want to continue seeing your father (I'm assuming), you'd prefer to sleep at your mom's house.

&gt; I don't know if it's my place to talk but him doing this is making me feel like their marriage didn't matter at all. Us kids don't matter at all

I think this is exactly what you need to say to your father."
"Well, that was out of line -- she should know better than to mention your abusive father's lack of interaction with you as a 'reason' for hers. Worse -- she also used *your* reasonable (and well earned via therapy) acceptance of your distance with your father as a reason you should be okay with hers. 

I wouldn't bring up the visits again; instead I'd ask her why she thinks stooping to your father's level of behavior is acceptable? Because she did. Please realize her words to you were **incredibly** manipulative. You didn't deserve them. "
"I agree with u/GetOfffMyLawn  You shouldn't do anything for your BF when you're on break that he doesn't do for you when you're working.  For instance, does your BF thoroughly clean the bathroom when you're working or does he leave it until you're off and then expect you to clean it?

Also, you shouldn't be expected to do much/any cleaning up after your roommate.

Also, it's kinda pathetic that a guy who only works 25-30 hours a week thinks someone else should do all the errands and housework for him."
"He doesn't care about the dog, he just wants to keep being involved with you.  Everytime you indulge him by answering the phone, arguing with him in person, texting him back, or engaging with him in and way other than to say ""leave now or I'm calling the police"" and then pulling out your phone and calling the police when he stands there and starts talking instead of leaving, you are giving him what he wants.  Your boyfriend is right to be concerned, because obsessive exes are probably one of the most dangerous things a woman will ever deal with in her life.  He's being a bit of a dumbass, though, for believing this is really about the dog.  I'll give him a pass because he's only 21, but you've really got to smarten up  yourself because you are the focus of this unbalanced man's attention and you are the one who is in danger."
"&gt;I can't let her win guys

She's not ""winning"" anything. She was one half of a shitty thing that happened to you. Your boyfriend is the other half. You should be AT LEAST as upset with him as you are with her. I mean, she really doesn't owe you anything. He's the one who lied to you and snuck around behind your back.

You don't have to like this woman, you don't have to go out of your way to be nice to her (though you know being professional is in your best interest. If some comes into your work, etc. just maintain professional politeness). But if you're having hateful feelings sometimes the best way to work through those is therapy.

And honestly as someone who has dealt with something similar, the thing that helped me stop hating her was to break up with my boyfriend. Then she suddenly wasn't a threat to my relationship any more and none of my misplaced anger (I SHOULD have been directing at HIM but was instead directing at HER) could make its way in her direction. She was just someone who worked near me, not someone I had to be ""worried"" about. Not someone who was making me feel inadequate and who was part of my trust issues.

BTW, I'm sure she didn't mean for it to be an insult or attack toward YOU. She did it perhaps because she's thoughtless about who's on the other end of cheating relationships etc. but I highly doubt she did it to cause you pain. He's the one who repeatedly defied your trust and your relationship and your effort. She didn't owe you shit. He's kind of the bad guy here. You can be mad at her for doing something shitty but she's not the one who made you promises and didn't keep them.
"
"&gt;though I’m still embarrassed for that tantrum

Y'know what? You're 16. You were long overdue for a tantrum. Plus, in this instance, I think it's pretty justified. Some of the tanties I threw as a teenager... oh my god, I cringe at them now. Not only because of how I behaved, but because the shit I was upset about was *soooooo* trivial. Like, someone finished the ice-cream kinda trivial.

Throwing tantrums to get your own way is a bad habit, but I don't think it's one you'll form. I also think you shouldn't be so hard on yourself. Don't downplay the amount of pressure that was put on you. Other people will take the chance to invalidate how you feel if it means they get to avoid responsibility -- don't do it to yourself, be on your own side. 

90% of your peers don't have to deal with this kinda shit. Good on you for getting pissed about it. I hope your dad sticks to his promises. You sound like a freaking amazing teenager, and I hope to god he realises how lucky he is to have you. And in case he doesn't say it to you, I want you to know that at least this stranger on the internet it proud of you."
"Just be glad that he felt he could share that with you, even if he was drunk when he did. You don't need to do anything with this information- both of these, in this day and age, are completely manageable conditions. Don't discuss it with your family or anyone else who knows him or people he knows, as it would be a huge breach of confidence and trust. Wait for him to bring it up again, otherwise just treat him the same as ever."
"&gt;So now she's been texting me telling me that her and some of my other friends want to talk to me about pet responsibility

Wow, that's fuckin rich. 

I'd be furious too. Given her response so far, I don't know that there's much you can say to get through to her. She's going to continue insisting this diet is healthy and she's only doing ""what's best"", so I would stick with the fact that it was absolutely unacceptable for her to change your pets diet without your knowledge or approval regardless of how she feels about their food. If you allow someone to watch your pets, you expect them to follow your directions. Their diet was not hers to change, end of story. And then of course I would never have her watch your pets again. "

"This was my first thought too. Some men find this sexy, and others just find it overbearing and honestly, a bit pathetic. Clearly catering to his every whim isn't working for you, so at a minimum I'd stop that and start pushing for a more equal relationship. But to answer your question, ""normal"" is subjective. Is it ""normal"" that he pictures other people when having sex with you? No idea, but it's definitely not respectful and he sounds like he's taking advantage of you in more ways than one. Find some self worth and walk away; this is completely one-sided."
"I know that him sleeping with some chick the same day probably hurts you big time. I've been in your shoes. Feels like a betrayal even though you had broken up. I just wanted to give you something to ease the sting of that, because I'm sure it hurts. Remember - he did that as a reaction to losing you. It was a sad, desperate act intended as a *fuck you* to you, and to somehow heal the pain he was feeling. And it didn't work. It never does.

You've made the right choice, and the best revenge is living well. So go enjoy your new place, and enjoy being independent with nobody mooching off you!"
"I mean my best friend and I have hung out since middle school. For the first three years of my daughter's life we hung out with them. The last time we did our kids were just...devils. We BOTH just looked at each other and I said ""Maybe our kids aren't compatible with each other age wise right now"" and while we get less time together we have just started hanging when we are kid free. 

I think you should be honest with your friends. Not honest like you were in this post, but that you would love to see them, but the family dynamic just isn't working. Your kids are in two completely different places and you would rather just see them when everyone is kid free. That seems kinder than what you have been doing. They are clearly upset if they showed up at your door! Good gracious.  "
WHY ARE YOU STILL WITH HIM?
"10/10 advice. WTF, like 14 yo don't know that pubs exist or they are never shown on television. If anything, it showed him the people don't always get shit-faced drunk when they go out like they show on TV. Fuck them, and their Bland ass lives. They don't want anybody to have any fun unless it's on their terms in a controlled environment. They can eat shit."
"You said that he tries, but cannot maintain the schedule, which makes me think that you guys do not have an actual chore wheel. Ok, I get it, chore wheels are boring and nobody wants them, but until you can settle into a routine, it is best to have a chore wheel and stick it on a board. Then when the household chores are done, then you can tick off what was done in the list. This serves as a constant reminder of what should be done, what has been done and what is left to be done. Once you do this often enough, you settle into a new routine which comes naturally, and will not need it anymore and can take it down.



As an idea, you can both sit together and start to discuss about what you can do. Let's say, one of you cooks on Wednesday, then the other can do the dishes. Or one of you cooks and clean on Wednesday and the other on Thursday, just as an example. Your husband can respond by saying that he cannot, let's say cook or clean or take out the trash on a certain day because sometimes they are required to work late, so doing a certain chore on a certain day does not fit into his work schedule. Go back and forth with this discussion until you settle into something that is actually practical. Make the chore wheel and stick it on a board so that it can be a constant reminder."

Please do not internalize that garbage, not even to be a good girlfriend. "
"&gt; I feel guilty knowing I'm the reason I'm the reason she hurts herself/others. 

No, you're not the reason, she is. 

She has awful, boundary pushing behavior that sounds like it is interfering with your ability to get your work done. It is up to her parents to teach and enforce appropriate behavior. 6 year olds understand that they are not supposed to throw tantrums, bug the shit out of people, or interfere with their parents' job. So if this woman truly can't understand that, then they need to arrange for her to have a carer or adult day care so that she doesn't interfere with their workplace. 

Right now you have accepted to be her de facto carer in addition to your job responsibilities. This is comfortable for them, because they don't want to cope with her and they have let this situation spiral out of control. However, this is not what you signed up for. 

Step One. Understand that she is not your responsibility. Taking care of her is not your responsibility, making sure she is happy is not your responsibility, her jealousy is not your responsibility, relieving your bosses of the burden of taking care of her is not your responsibility. 

In other words, you have a case of the nice girl syndrome. You have decided to take on the emotional labor of making everybody in your environment happy. You need to question that assumption. It is a very exhausting way to live, and gets you into situations like this, with unbalanced or exploitative people taking everything from you they can and more. 

Having been friendly to this girl does not oblige you to indulge her and make sure she is always happy. Neither does it oblige you to be your friend if she does not treat you well. Her behavior would be called abusive if a boyfriend were doing it. Well, it is abusive. 

You know what is your responsibility? Your job. 

Step Two. You need to block her number. That need to have happened a long time ago. Someone who is obsessed with you and texts you 113 times in one day is someone with whom there is no possibility of friendship. You need to drop the idea of ever socializing with her again. No more cinema, none of that. You tried it, and it didn't work out, end of story. 

Step Three. Your job responsibilities entail you supervising her with the till. Ok, do that. Also, do anything else you need to do, including talk to customers as long as you need to and giving out your number, as long as that isbokay with your bosses. If she can't deal with it, remember, that is her problem, not yours. 

Step Four. You need to have a sit down with your bosses and explain, in detail with approximate dates (make a list), of times when her behavior was unprofessional: getting jealous of you talking to a customer, following you around to the point where you can't get your work done, repeating your name over, crying out back for 4 hours, etc. 

Simply state the facts of her behavior and how it affects your job performance. Do not apologize. Do not reassure them. Do not downplay or excuse her behavior. Do not say, even once, ""She is an amazing girl"" or any other patronizing thing. Even though it is your instinctive impulse to say these things, soften the blow, comfort everybody, don't. Your mission is to state facts. Write down a list and read from it if necessary, or write it as a succinct, professional, factual letter, and then hand it to then when you're done. 

If they get angry at you for bringing them this news, if the retaliate against you in some way, or then you have a boss problem and you need to start looking for another job. 

TL; DR. Carer for disabled adult is not part of your job description. "

"My grandmother was a nurse until she had kids; when they started school full-time, she went back to work. Of course my grandfather worked the entire time.

Her dad was miffed that she'd gone back to work. 12ish years later, my grandfather died suddenly at 52 and she did not remarry. She has said many times how glad she was that she could take care of herself and her remaining kid at home without a husband. "

"it's a real long shot, because this is obviously based on insecurity and emotions rather than logic, but maybe you can prove to her how editing/music etc. have a major impact by showing her some of the recut trailers people have done that show how important these cues are. 

 Like there is a Funny or Die one where they recut the trailer to Top Gun and change the music and narration to make it look like a gay love story without actually changing any of the footage And there's one where they again change just the music and narrator to make the trailer to The Shining look like a romantic comedy.

I know it's a long shot, but I hope it helps."
"It sounds as though your Dad's angry that he isn't getting the glory for giving your son the money (now that you know he didn't). He also probably feels guilty that his elderly mother just gave away $5000 rather than the $2500 he'd expected; it doesn't sound like he was ever planning on paying his mother the other half of the money, he just wanted you to. 

I wouldn't worry about your Grandmother. If she's the type of person who'd happily give $5000 to save her great Grandson's sight then she's probably the type of person who, were she to forget, would be happy to know that she'd done it when reminded. 

The only person taking advantage of your Grandmother here is your father. "
"&gt;Him: About this guy you've started to date. You will never find anyone even half as good as me.

Looks like you'll just have to ride this one out. The important people know the truth (who cares what BIL's bro's friends think? Also, they probably know he's full of shit, having seen the texts), and other people can be informed if necessary. This will likely blow over with time.

But yeah, jeez, this proves your point exactly - dating in-law family can be extremely messy. Even if you *had* dated this guy, his garbageness would've caused an end to it and then you'd have to deal with even greater fallout."

Forcing you to take the pain meds and taking away your phone and laptop are frightening in themselves. With the rest of the behavior, you need to get out of there ASAP. I'd be very nervous about her putting drugs in your food or something. 

Tell your other siblings it's an emergency when you ask again if you can stay with them. Also, don't give your mother warning that your fiancée is coming to get you. In fact, avoid the confrontation and have her just meet you at work or at home.

Ask your other siblings if they've noticed changes in her behavior? It's possible this is an early symptom of dementia or... something?

Be extremely clear with your mother regarding what boundaries and behavior she has to adhere to in order to stay in contact with you. As in, she doesn't get free rein to touch you when and where she wants, or see you naked, or anything else that makes you uncomfortable. She doesn't get to bulldoze your boundaries just because she's your mother. And she is required to at least be polite and respectful to your fiancée. If she violates either of those, hang up/leave and no contact for a week. Next time it's two weeks. Etc. "

"She knows it makes her tits fly out, so at this point she must want it to make her boobs fly out. I think you've got to decide how much you like being with an exhibitionist because it's clearly making you uncomfortable and she's not willing to compromise on it (and ""please wear a properly fitting swimsuit around my family/on work trips"" is not being controlling, it's a pretty reasonable request)."
"I'm a gay man who struggled with my sexuality for years. While I didn't ever try and pretend to be straight, when asked if I was interested in any girls, I would dismiss the question with a simple, ""I'm too busy to think about that sort of thing."" The idea of being in a gay relationship terrified me. Even when I did come out, I really didn't even know any other gay people. When I actually did encounter other gay people, I was incredibly nervous. Probably like how you feel now.

How did I get over it? Exposure. I know it's only a week away, but maybe you can do some homework. Is there a PFLAG meeting in your town that you can attend? If not, they have a support phone line that you can call. You might find it difficult to talk with friends about this, because (rightfully) homophobia is slowly becoming a taboo thing in our society. So maybe talking with a stranger whose goal is to help the friends and family of gay people would help.

There are also loads of books that you can read that can help you understand what your brother has gone through, and what his relationship is like now. You mentioned how it took your parents a month to accept that he's bisexual. But you didn't mention how long it took him to accept it. He came out a year ago, when he was 19 years old? So yeah, that's how long it took him. 19 years.

Watch some gay media. Watch some movies, some TV shows. Understand that some things might be dated and a little problematic, and that not every portrayal of a gay person is indicative of the entire community. But each amount of exposure will help you on the path to making it feel normal.

Listen to some gay podcasts. Savage Love, hosted by Dan Savage is an advice show for gay and straight people and everything in between. I credit him to my healthy attitude about sex. Listen to Throwing Shade, hosted by a gay man and straight woman, they, ""take a weekly look at all the issues important to ladies and gays... and treat them with much less respect than they deserve.""

And I don't mean to be the word police, but there were a couple of things that stuck out in your post that are easily correctable. First, you said that you're quite traditional, as in, ""white, somewhat religious, suburban, middle class."" You're not traditional, because that is not everybody's tradition. Tradition is, ""In my family it's traditional for everybody to receive a teddy bear for Christmas."" You're conservative. You're white. You (were) somewhat religious. You're suburban. You're middle class. But for a black person, traditional isn't white. For a poor person, traditional isn't middle class. I'm sure you get it by now. You're a conservative man who is trying to grow, and learning to accept your brother for who he truly is. And that's commendable. Not every LGBT person has that. Many of us, to this day, are routinely cut off from our families simply for coming out and expressing who they truly are.

Also, you mention that your brother's boyfriend seems ""quite flamboyant."" You didn't say that in a negative way, but when the word ""flamboyant"" is used by a straight person to describe a gay person, it's usually in a negative connotation. Maybe his boyfriend is feminine. And that's okay. Not everybody has to adhere strictly to the usual gender norms. In my opinion, many of the ""flamboyant"" gay guys are some of the bravest people I know. In a culture where rigid masculinity is portrayed as the ideal, and homosexuality and gender non-conforming traits are constant threats to that masculinity, it takes a lot of guts for a feminine gay man to be themselves in public like that. Your brother's flamboyant boyfriend? That guy has balls of steel.

As for meeting his boyfriend, I know this is easier said than done, and I already dismissed this advice, but treat him like a normal person. Talk to him like you would have talked to your brother's ex-girlfriend. You guys probably have some things in common, like maybe a mutual love of Game of Thrones. Just suss it out like you would meeting anybody for the first time.

If you haven't come around yet on the issue of gay rights (which, come on, it's 2017), I don't think it would be a good idea to discuss that if questioned about it. Don't say things like, ""Well, I think gay marriage should be left up to the states."" And don't especially say the libertarian line of, ""Well, I don't think the government should be in the marriage business at all."" Don't say, ""Well, I think that businesses should be able to refuse business to gay people, that's their right."" Just stick with the line of, ""You know, my brother coming out last year has really made me reexamine a lot of my beliefs that I never really had to think about before. I've been doing a lot of reading on the issue, and I don't feel well versed enough to discuss it yet.""

And finally remember, maybe you're brother's boyfriend is an obnoxious jerk. That's always a possibility.

Good luck."
Seconded. You don't deserve any of that and those people hiding their hatred behind anonymity ought to be accountable. 
"Here's a suggestion, well, more of an observation: Your wife is an adult, who is studying to be an optometrist, she can figure out how to feed herself.

Look, she told you that she is just going to act difficult until you figure out a way to divorce her. Stop letting her walk all over you."
"Time to have a ""come to Jesus"" talk with him. ""Husband, we cannot afford our bills right now. You need to start looking for a job.""

Does he know what dire straits the finances are in? The fact that he's unwilling to even communicate with you on this issue is a huge red flag and if he continues to to nothing about his job situation, it may be prudent to separate for the time being while he figures out if he wants to be a functioning adult again. "
"&gt;I don't believe he's a bad person. I really don't.

He's a piece of shit and he is not your friend. He has been treating you like garbage as you've tried to recover over something he pressured you into doing. Kick him out of your life because you're worth more than this."
"Curious, do you have a prenup?

You hate your wife's family and don't care about her or your relationship with them.  Unfortunately, it appears your wife does care.  It sounds like she doesn't want to see them homeless and starving, which you know damn well is what happens to people who go medically bankrupt. So you've got a problem.

If money is your sole concern, decide if it would be cheaper to pay a few hospital bills or divorce.  "
"The crying is manipulative behavior. If anything, it is not guilt, or he wouldn't have mocked you about turning you into a doormat.

This is just his way of continuing the status quo.

You really don't need to be with him. I'm sorry you're dealing with such an ass."
"Ok wow this post was really hard to read. I've been where your sister is. My ex husband was a little different, but overall, yeah. Abusive, gas lighting, everything. I was totally brainwashed. I bought and swallowed all his lies. Thinking back on that time, I'm still surprised I got out. 

My advice is going to be hard. Really hard. But you need to be there for her and stop talking about this. Deep down, she likely knows she's with a psycho. People who hurt animals are bad news. But he's going to isolate her, because that's one of the first things abusers do, and feeding her an ""us against the world"" fantasy will seal that. You need to stick around and be her rope back to reality. My sister was that for me. We fought and fought about my ex, but she always came back and even sometimes apologized for upsetting me, which, looking back, probably tasted like shit in her mouth. But when I finally woke up and was ready to run, I called her. I couldn't trust my parents because they're king and queen of ""told you so"", my brother and I weren't speaking, and I'd lost contact with all my friends because my ex didn't like them. So she was it. 

I actually called her and asked her how she did it, just for this post. She said she hated it, she hated him, and she was actually really mad at me for putting her through this, but she held on because she knew I'd have saved her. She would pray and think of us as kids playing together while listening to me go on and on about everything he was doing. She thought about different plans to get me out when the time came while listening. And maybe I knew I was going to need her. I don't know what will work for you. I really, really fucking hope she gets out. I'm so sorry this is happening to your family. Hugs. "
YES YES YES. I came in here to say this. The school admins are jerks. 
"Links aren't allowed, but OP, I strongly suggest you Google ""She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes by the Sink"" on Huffpost. It sounds like you're leaving a lot of little messes you could easily clean up as you go and leaving your wife with the majority of emotional labor regarding upkeep. A maid service might help with the bigger things, but you're going to need to step up with the littler things regardless. It can make a world of difference for both of you."
"She's bringing law enforcement, her father, and her brother, and she has contacted my best friend (the one I sent a 911 FB message to earlier), and he is coming too. "
"Cats are not JUST carnivores. They are OBLIGATE carnivores. They DO NOT digest plant matter and they NEED A diet that is MOSTLY meat. I'm saying this to both of you, since you suguested the jury is still out. It isn't. Biology called it. 

It isn't appropriate for your friend to switch your animal's food, even if it was healthier, though. Do not let her watch your animals in the future. Do not listen to her advice, she is mis treating her own animals. To be honest, cats are so important to me (that's why I feed them MEAT) that I would probably distance myself from this person. It isn't cruel to feed them what they NEED to eat and we're designed to eat. Cats are beautiful apex predators. If that's too cruel, I would suggest a rabbit, mouse, or other prey animal as a pet. You want a predator, you get one."
"Well, first, I'd get a paternity test to make sure the baby is yours. If it is, then you've done fucked up OP. This is the consequence of having unprotected sex with someone you barely know. At the end of the day, abortions are 100% the mother's decision and if she wants to keep it, then you're SOL. I'd look into paternity/child support laws in the country where your gf is going to raise the baby. Also, remember, you two don't have to be together to be good parents. Don't try and make things work with her for the kid if things aren't working out. Don't uproot your whole life for this kid. But do make sure you pay keep your legal obligations in supporting the kid. "
"The idea that being gay is a choice just fucking blows my mind because WHY would anyone choose something that leads to the kind of treatment your son is receiving from his mother? Why would anyone consciously decide to be something that could get them assaulted or even killed, by their own hands or another?

Think about that for a second. Does that mindset make sense to you?"
"Why don't you just call his mom and tell her that her son planned a camping trip, and unfortunately you can't watch them so she'll have to board them or convince her son to stay home? 

It seems like that's a pretty easy deal to fix. The bigger problem is the fact you're still planning to marry this dude. "
"The 10% to the church is the least of your worries. Why do you let yourself be a human ATM? Why do you financially support an adult woman you're not even married to? Get your shit together, man. "
"I think the important thing, here, is that he's being deployed. It's not like you're going to see him every day for dinner even if you're allowed to move somewhere closer to him down range. It's going to be long distance either way, and you're going to have a lot of time to spend waiting and being bored while he's deployed. 

I think getting a degree while all that's going on is a darn good use of your time. "
"Yeah, OP should ask to see his business plan outlining his business model, planned revenues, how he's marketing himself/his business, etc.

He can't do that? Sorry, he doesn't have a business, he has a hobby or (worse) a dream, and an expensive one at that.

Starting a small business isn't for the faint of heart, and what makes a good small business owner are generally the same qualities that make fantastic employees - discipline, creativity, business sense, social skills, etc. It's okay to admit you're not ""fantastic"" and operate better with a boss than without one."
"Then he needs to not only acknowledge that he has a problem, but work to fix it. That's on him. Although in another response of yours, apparently he doesn't know how to change. 

This relationship is 7-months old. That's supposed to be the honeymoon stage, where you two plan and actually go on dates. His sex drive is just not sustainable in a relationship, especially one this young and where you two have different expectations. Even if this were a FWB arrangement, this is too much.

Personally, I think he's throwing excuses at you and hoping you're gullible enough to accept him as he is and keep following his sex schedule. Pretty soon he might even throw out the ""sex addiction"" line. "
"For a couple, especially one with small children, a ballpark (followed by an update if the ballpark off by more than a 30-40 mins) is a basic courtesy. 

You're not 'checking up on him' like a mother. You are his life partner, wife and mother of his children and you are managing the basic functions of a damn household that he is part of. He is a parent and an adult. It is literally *the least* he can do to offer up this information as well as he is able.

If you used to fume or hold him to unrealistic standards, then it's understandable he is a bit raw and anxious about this, but nevertheless, this is a case where he needs to stop dwelling in the past resentments and behave with respect towards you and his family."
"&gt; He does minimal housework, only because he knows I'll get upset if it's trashed when I get home.

I think this is the biggest red flag, honestly. It means that he clearly doesn't give a shit about having an equal partnership with you, and clearly doesn't feel bad about not pulling his weight. He's just using you to pay his rent and let him be lazy. If he doesn't have a job to contribute to your incomes, his job should be the homemaker - he should do all the household chores, and cook the meals. Then he would be contributing. "
"Unrelated to your actual issue, but in the future if you need a dog to give you something they have, rather than taking it (which can lead to possessiveness and aggression) a safer course of action is ""trading"" the dog dog for a higher value reward. So if the dog LOVES peanut butter, you get peanut butter and offer it to the dog so the dog drops what is has. Keep upping the trade offer you're making until the dog responds. 

My dogs caught and killed a squirrel. There was no chance in hell I could just take it out of her mouth. My boy dog came real quick for a different treat. But she required and entire bowl of treats before the value of the treats was higher than the value of the squirrel. She dropped the squirrel and I quickly grabbed it into a trash bag.

To be clear, I'm NOT blaming you in this scenario. Just suggesting a safer future action applicable to any dog you need to drop something."
"Everything about this story is pretty bizarre, from K's wife to the fact that a grown man with children is spending so much time with his friends that 3 x 2 hour sessions  a week is considering ""cutting it down."" Who is watching this guy's children? Is it all W all the time? I'm not saying that there is any justification for abuse, but it sounds like K and W need to sort out their marriage before they sort out their friendships. If you are genuinely afraid for your friend though ask your husband to check on him. "
"Yeah. It would be bad if he had looked up from the game in a panic, saying ""oh my god I swear he was just here playing a second ago!"" 

Unless OP phrased it badly, his response implies that he *knew* he was unaware where the kid was, and didn't care."
"Of course you still love him! You were married for 8 years and then lost it in an instant. You need time to grieve. Throw yourself into school for awhile, and be understanding towards yourself.  You can't switch off your feelings just because you know he wronged you."
"Yeah, that, and at least her ma drank enough to give her brother fetal alcohol syndrome. Another clue. Someone really broke with their past here. "
"I honestly don't understand why you had extended conversations with *other people* about her, so much so they you've come here with a consensus you gathered about what you perceive her faults and issues are and an entire background story about why she is the way she is. It's really disturbing. It's as if you weren't really in a relationship with her, you were putting her under a microscope so you can *story* this relationship. 

You can't possibly have been without fault here. For one, this whole thing, talking extensively to other people about what you think her problems are and how much you've invested in this backstory, it's gross. Especially since you seem to have never had a conversation with her. 

Just leave her alone, stop talking about her, stop analyzing her. "
"I'm sure that eating a lot of cupcakes and junk food is super great for a kid with a heart condition! Good plan, bro!"
"I don't know why people are calling you a troll. I've been through this exact experience. 

In college, I dated a guy who ate french fries. That's it. Literally just fries. Nothing else. He had some very, very deep-seated psychological issues tied to an abusive childhood and he just shut down when it came to other food. Never saw anything but potatoes pass his lips. 

I stayed with him way too long. Three years. (He was a genuinely shitty person in addition to the all this.) By the end of year one, I was fed up with the fries thing, but I tried to be nice about it. Offered to cook baked or mashed potatoes. Tried to get him into sweet potato fries or fried zucchini. It just did not work. I remember asking him to change. Begging him to do it not for me, but for him. He cried and said no, there was just no way. I gave up again. 

For the next two years, I dealt with it, and it sucked. We almost always went out for food, since he only ate oven fries at home. I started to really dislike diners and fast food joints, just because we went there so often. He convinced me to go to Red Robin on my birthday one year so that he could just eat my order of bottomless fries and not cost a dime. Never mind that I'm a vegetarian and hate burger places. He ate free, so I grudgingly went with it. Our (very few) friends made endless comments to me about it, constant jokes about his diet. Worst of all, I gained a ton of weight due to eating out at greasy places all the time. I'm still dealing with that and it's been 4 years. 

It was not cute. It was not quirky. It was awful. We couldn't cook together, couldn't explore new places and try new things. Everything always came right back around to fucking french fries. 

It was not the reason we broke up, but god, what a sigh of relief it was to be able to go out for sushi. Or make a salad for dinner. I started cooking more seriously after the relationship was over, and I've enjoyed every moment of it. 

OP, if you think you can deal with an experience like mine, keep dating him. But if not....please do yourself a favor and go. This is not a joke. It is draining as all hell to date a person who eats one thing. 

Good luck to you."
"Just go for it :) 
You seem very respectful of her, and that's a great quality to have!"
Alright the consensus seems to be this is nothing to worry about :) thank you everyone! Glad to know my trust is in him is not misplaced. 
"You don't just get to ""ghost"" your wife. What the actual fuck is that?

He stood in front of people and said vows to make your relationship a forever thing, if he doesn't even provide you with 5 minutes to discuss that he's an utter piece of shit.

You're supposed to be a partnership, this isn't his to just end all by himself. 

Speak to a lawyer as soon as you can, I hope you have somewhere to stay right now?"
"Please cut all contact from him and his family.   It's a statistical fact that men who choke their partners are more likely to end up killing them than men who are just physically abusive in other ways.

If you go back to him, there's a more than even chance you'll end up a statistic.   Do you want to take that chance?    There's plenty more men you can fall in love with in the future who know how to argue constructively.  You deserve one of those men."

"Honestly, I wouldn't care that much about your figurine, but this is seriously fucked up:

&gt; I told her to stop wich she did but all of them started laughing when they saw that my dog lower jaw was shaking.

They sound completely terrible. I would probably leave it alone for now and let her sleep this off. Tomorrow, when you're both clearheaded, maybe she'll realize how awful they were and apologize. If not, you should probably reconsider this relationship."
"This will at least show him the hassle he's creating. Many folks on here describe situations like yours OP, and say that it works because they hate to cook and their partner likes it. Well, the thing is, cooking is fun for those that love it, but hardly anyone loves to clean, so your BF has a pretty sweet deal right now even if you don't care for cooking (and it sounds more like you're neutral but he *just loves it* and that's why he gets to do the fun chore)."
"Do they have other kids? Can you offer to babysit when they are in the hospital? If not, send them some good food home while she is recovering. There isn't much you can do unfortunately. "
This is probably exactly what happened. The guy spends all day playing video games when asked to look after the child and the wife is fed up as she should be. Parenting should be equal. Kids need stimulation and age appropriate activities. Watching Dad play Overwatch or something isn't that. 
"He's putting you in a no-win situation. He doesn't let you cook, but he makes you clean his giant mess. Yeah, no.

Tell him that if he can't see how unfair this is, then you and he will cook, eat and clean separately from one another. He will clean up his entire mess the same evening, so it's not sitting overnight and so the kitchen is always usable. 

If this doesn't help him see how messy and unreasonable he is, and how much effort he is *requiring* you to put forth against your will, then I think you should not longer put up with him."
"&gt;I love this woman, but only her personality

That sounds like a friend, not a girlfriend. This isn't sustainable, you're going to have to break up at some point. "
"As someone who is tall and always considered himself someone that liked tall girls, I've dated a shorter girl and it was kind of a new idea and I didn't really notice after a while. It might just be something he's never questioned before. 

If he makes you feel bad for being short, then hard pass. Otherwise it might just be a matter of him being surprised at his attraction to you and making stupid comments about it because he's unsure about something he always considered to be part him his self identity and discovering it's not."
You are in an abusive relationship. Please confide in your aunt when she arrives and have her help you plan to leave this man. You are not safe with him.
"20months isn't a very long time to really get to know someone, particularly when you are so young and there is still so many changes that you will go through as you develop /grow. 

Your family concerns are valid, particularly if they don't place the same value on premarital sex as you do. 

If a big part of you getting married is sex then you may be rushing it. Divorce not being an option doesn't make anyone feel at ease because it means that you could be trapped in this relationship that is damaging to you. 

I think you will need to evaluate why you are doing this and what is preventing you from waiting until you get to know each other better. "
"&gt;how do I console my wife

You don't. You can't console people over the fact that they're utter fucks. They need to set themselves straight."

"Honestly your best bet at this point is to leave. File for divorce, get some shared custody. Your wife isn't going to change, ever. "
"""Dear Ex-Wife,

Last time we interacted, you cruelly kept me from retrieving my father's and grandfather's tools which you knew meant a lot to me. You falsely accused me of violence to the cops, forcing me into a long, expensive, and hurtful legal battle.

Quite simply, I have zero reason to believe you are telling the truth this time and that this is not just a trap to cause me harm again. Have you changed? If so, prove it. Bring me my tools, tell me why you brought trumped-up charges against me, explain how you know what you did was wrong. Then I will consider helping you.""

She'll probably just get angry and hang up on you. Problem solved! If she's somehow so desperate for your help that she follows through - do NOT allow her to promise your tools AFTER you help her - give her the various phone numbers she needs that others in this sub have suggested and close the door on her. In the unlikely even that she does actually do this, film her giving you the tools and her apology in case she tries shit again."
My wife and I talked and over dinner tonight we're going to offer her $500 a month for pet care and $250 for savings on the condition that she take one day off a week :)
"They've always been controlling and prejudice, but I never expected to be evil. I always hoped that my parents and I could have some sort of relationship in the future, but I guess I now know better."

"All men are not like this, despite what recent ""Locker room talk"" lines have been spouted.

"Save the screenshot for sure, but please, try to get as much info out of him on his own before letting him know how much you know and from where. You don't want to give him the power to set the narrative. Even just providing that you saw the picture gives him an out to claim it was just a dinner. Providing him info allows him to trickle-truth and that's about as bad as lying, in my book."
"So...they are making you babysit for free, essentially. You are being taken advantage of. "
"&gt; The stripper used a condom, thank god.

Hes giving you the trickle truth and lieing to you..... Why do you believe this statement? If youve done anything sexual with him after hes gotten back, youre going to need to get tested in a month (it can take a month for some STDs to show on tests).

At the very least, the wedding should be pushed back until after you get your results back from being tested, and you both need premarital counseling before getting married as well."
"This is really your only move. You're in an unwinnable game- Only solution is not to play. 

Are you SURE this is what you want to do with your life. I've been dating a single mom(of 1) for a year and it's hard even though she has her shit together. There's no way I'd put up with what you describe. "
You don't think she could survive without you cooking and cleaning? Pretty sure she could figure it out. Lol.
"I'm a dad, and I would never introduce my kids to a new woman before knowing her for a couple of months and being reasonably sure that this was a relationship that will last. I would also introduce her to my kids in a less blunt way. Your father is right on the principle that you should be happy about him finding someone new, but not the way that he is handling it, that is highly disrespectful of you. He can send me a private message if he wants to talk to somebody in a similar situation. As can you. I wish you all the best and that he listens to you about this serious issue. He should also be a better role model."
"Im a little confused, who's name is actually on the deed of the house?  If your parents arent on there, you can tell them to kick dirt.  If they are, I'd take the loss and move out (though there is zero reason to leave your furniture behind if that is stuff you paid for)."
"I think this is a great response! There is definitely a difference between things that could be detrimental to any relationship (""red flags"") and personality traits that simply make two people incompatible. "
"""Socially off"" is the excuse society provides to allow predators to fly under the radar. This guy is 40. He knows better than to force a woman to kiss him. He just doesn't care, and he fooled you into thinking he's ""socially off""."
"Also, I wanna add that they may be trying to fend you off so Fred can stay in the family business and help do the work. But he shouldnt have to. He has his own life and by what I've read, it is a good life together. Move towards your own life and the life with you SO. "
"I'm not going to address whether or not you should give your son up, because that's a deeply personal question only you can answer.  What I will address is the following:

&gt;Would it be completely deranged to ask Tonya if she's really interested in adopting him? Would it damage our relationship enough that it would impact Charlie? I'm at a point where I really think giving him a home with another adult is best for both of us. I can't take this much longer. 

You are at your limit.  In your post, you describe someone who is self-sacrificing to an extreme level.  You have no adult friends or romantic interests.  I wonder if your lack of self-care a large reason why you feel like you are at your limit.  

Is it possible to have Charlie spend some more time with Tanya while you take some time for yourself?  Use this time to get out and develop relationships with other people.  "
"Good lord, leave the woman alone. Fetal alcohol syndrome in her brother is a great clue that her mom is an alcoholic. Who knows what other kind of bullshit she had to put up with growing up. And don't tell her parents where she can be found, either. Consider her no longer a relative, she wants it that way. "
unless they're southern. someone gave me a fridge once.
"Also these are hookers, so there's no ""one thing led to another"". He or one of the groomsmen negotiated and paid for the BJ first, and THEN she took off his pants. Hookers don't do their thing and then hope for tips, lol. You pay them in advance.

"MIL moves 12 hours away from her autistic son who is dependent on others for income, life management, etc. She is pissed that you don't want to be around him. Hmm. She probably hoped the brothers would step in and take over for her. How disappointing for her. Don't let her guilt you into this responsibility. 

As a side note, since OB has a wife and 2 daughters, I think you and your husband need to clearly communicate to them YB's history of behavior with you, if you haven't already. They have a right to protect their own family as they see fit, in light of this. 

Extra side note: your MIL doesn't know what this guy is watching! Disney, ok, sure, Mom. Your grown son who repeatedly tells his SIL he wants to fuck her and exposes himself to her is watching the Suite Life of Zack and Cody, not Hot Horny MILFs. :P"
"Try to remember, people are generally on their *best* behavior on a first date.  This is how he behaves at his best.  How will he behave at his worst?"
"Yes, this is an infringement on your privacy. It's also worth mentioning that you're absolutely damn right about living with your future partner for at least a year before marriage. This is unreasonable; you're an adult.

"I don't think I made myself clear.

If he's paying $1000 in mortgage costs, and you are paying $1000 in groceries, utilities, etc., on the surface it looks fair because you are both paying the same. But you are getting screwed because his money is turning into equity, and yours is not. At the end of thirty years of contributing ""equally"" he owns a house and you own nothing.

Honestly.. it sounds like that could be it. He can't possibly still 'love' a dog he's not seen in years. 
"No offense to OP but I can barely follow the post. I mean I know what geocaching, smash and wow are but it seems like a (niche) ramble. Is the question how can we have together hobbies and separate hobbies healthily?"
"One of the worst funerals I directed involved a little boy whose parents had died. The poor kid was overwhelmed, had shut down, and yet had to stand there and listen while his older siblings and other relatives fought over him like dogs with a catatonic bone. Don't take him to the funeral. He'd get nothing out of it at best. At worst he's having a freak out because he just saw his parents and they won't wake up. Besides, funerals in general suck for little kids. They're long, boring, and scary because all of thier trusted adults are unhappy. 

Him staying at your sister's seems best. He needs to have a serene, stable life for a while, with a set schedule and place to sleep. In fact, your sister could get approval from foster care to officially be his guardian, which would open up all sorts of benefits for them (therapy for him, financial aid, etc). Foster care isn't going to whisk him away as long as there is acceptable family willing to take him."
"Hey OP.

For a long time I also thought noone cared about me. 

As it turns out, I found out through some soul-searching and asking that I gave off a ""don't talk to me"" vibe. Small, short replies; silent for a long time; just not paying attention to the people around me, etc. What I once perceived as people ignoring or even disliking me, was actually them respecting what they thought was my will to be left alone. 

When a new person enters a group, they are showered with attention because they are new and people try to be welcoming. After a while, they react to the person according to how their friendship develops. So they were paying attention to your friend, not you, because they're thinking ""this new person is probably feeling awkward, let's try and include them"". 

Whereas for you, they're probably thinking ""let's leave shyandignored alone, she seems to enjoy her quiet time"". 

Unfortunately, it's up to you to break the cycle. 

Do you greet people when they come online? Do you try to engage frequently with them? There's no need to bombard other people with questions, but if you want them to interact more with you, try to ask them about their day, remember what they say and ask follow-up questions later on.

People are more receptive to talking than you might think. But you have to put in the effort, and show them that you want to talk to them.

I hope this helps. "
"

&gt;he says ""get off me"" or ""get away from me"" or ""leave me alone"" or ""I need space"".

That's rude.  ""I need space"" is sort of okay, but he could be nicer about it.  Also, he should acknowledge your efforts to touch him more, as he asked you to.  

Overall, this guy just sounds like too much work.  He's terrible at communication.  "
"You are the scapegoat. If it wasn't you, it'd be someone or something else. Because this couldn't possibly be what Fred want or, hypothetically, if he were making a mistake that couldn't be his choice or his fault.

Op, this has very little to do with you and it's all about Fred making strides to better his life in a way that dismisses what his family wanted for him. So when he deals with this, he needs to approach it from the correct angle - not so much 'be nicer to my gf' (though they should be nicer!) and more 'I'm making my own choices and they make me happy. You need to stop trying to hold me back.'"
"Yeah, he's been lying for the last three *years* but it's apparently shocking his wife hasn't processed it all in a *week*.

Obviously she's gonna step back when the initial rush of ""we can fix it!"" passes, she's likely now realizing she may be exposing her baby to a heroin addict. Kind of a big deal."

"I'm guessing your BF didn't bring it up because he was afraid of a negative reaction.

Maybe you don't have to spell out that you know, but let him know that you're not going to judge him for his kinks or whatever it is he wants to bring up.

&gt;But alternatively, is this a door I want to open?

It's just cross dressing?  I'm not sure what your apprehensions are here."
"&gt; I asked him if he was serious and he said “Seriously, I haven’t made any other plans.” 

Sounds like a personal problem, if you ask me. Tell him no. Do not open your door for him. "
"Um, what? Not to go all conspiracy theory on you, but are you sure your husband is who he says he is?"
"&gt;According to him I am not a normal woman, he thinks that all women love to have sex in the morning.

Woman here. I am seriously not a fan of morning sex, especially not at 5 fucking am. Everyone's breath is not great and you're still groggy. He's talking out of his arse here.

&gt;He will not go to couples counseling with me. Or sexual therapist or anything like that. He says it would be waste of time and money because he doesn't see the issue.

I think this is the biggest issue. He doesn't want the situation to change. He wants to keep bugging you and manipulating you for way more sex, and you're already giving him more than a lot of partners. He doesn't care that you're feeling resentful and worn down by his selfish, inconsiderate behaviour. And he definitely doesn't want to be told that he is in the wrong here. He would rather have a marriage where you are unhappy but he's satisfied than even try to strike a compromise with you.

"
"&gt; ""If you do that I'm not seeing N. (our daughter) ever again.""

I am sorry, I think that is his DREAM. He only spends time with her to impress his friends. He doesnt really want her. 

THIS, this is a clear indication that you NEED to divorce him. "
"It's not a matter of maturity. You just have different ideas of how to spend your spare time. As long as you get along and have things you can enjoy together, there's no point in trying to force yourself spend your spare time like he does. You'll grow at your own pace."
Lol that last paragraph made me laugh. Like what lol
"Sounds like maybe she caught feelings or something. Either way, it's clear that she cannot handle the FWB thing so I would end that unless you want more episodes like this. "
"Unfortunately you do need to define some more things I think.  
When you say he told her ""I miss touching her thigh when out drinking with co-workers"".  
Sorry but that to me means that they feel comfortable enough with one another PHYSICALLY, that they are acting like a couple, in front of co-workers and in public."
"If they are constantly borrowing money from their children, then they are screwing up... 

You can't fix this situation, it's up to your GF... but she should not feel obligated to finance her parents bad decisions. "
"&gt; Was there anything illegal about your brother being at the pub?

No, bars here are 21+ but this was a pub and lots of people come and go, including families. "
"You owe nothing to nobody. Tell your mom that if the lady feels so bad she can drop off a care package but you have no interest in meeting her and if your mom brings it up again it's going to severely damage your relationship with her.

And by the way, this dog does actually sound dangerous, and I'm concerned that by not addressing the issue that you are creating a situation where somebody else is going to get hurt."
"&gt; instead of buying cigs for herself and beer for her alcoholic/pothead boyfriend that hits her on occasion.

Girl, seriously, move out."
"What everyone else is saying – of course you don't. It's her fault for pretending she spoke French. You weren't even trying to catch her out – just going on the information available. On a different note, Jake sounds super supportive and a lovely boyfriend in the face of a ridiculous overbearing family!"
Your post focuses on this one incident but holy crap do Jake's parents sound like awful future in-laws. They don't seem to respect his relationship with you at all. I feel like it's time for Jake to start drawing firmer boundaries about everything or they're gonna be horrible to you forever!
"I think it's weird to want to hang out with a friends boyfriend, one on one, unless she knew him previously. Which in this case she didn't, right?

You might be wrong. There are some people who feel the need to flirt with everyone who is of the gender they are attracted to, no matter whether they intend to make a move on them or not. 

Maybe you should just keep your eye on the situation for now? 

If she really is making a move for him, she really isn't a good friend. "
"I didn't realise there was a word for it! Emotional loan sharking. God, that's perfect."
"Can you visit your mother early, and leave right after Christmas? There is almost a full week between Christmas and New Years. There really shouldn't be a problem visiting your mother and leaving on the 26th, and that would give you a few days before your father's wedding."
"If I did math right, you were 16/17 and he was 23/24 (maybe) when you started dating. Not only were you much younger, you were in a very vulnerable position emotionally. 
This guy seems like he knows how to play people. Maybe he played you too?  

Hiding money and lying to the IRS about what is most an easy fix is.. Iffy at best.   "
And you saved their poor subordinates from working for a couple of assholes. 
"Man, I bet you ANYTHING if we read a post from her, we'd all side with her. You really seem stubborn and self-centered. 

I bet her post would be like ""my asshole husband thinks I look gross with my body hair, expects me to turn him on, doesn't get the point of therapy, and this makes me not attracted to him anymore. I'd love to have sex with him if he weren't such a damn asshole."" "
"Jake also needs to say ""*Mom, Dad, enough of this shit*""  
He also should say something when they bring Maddy up, or every time they downplay your abilities/skills"
"The two of you should never have started a relationship if this is something you feel this strongly about.

She has lied to you about smoking, but you are not innocent in this. You have not supported her in beating her addiction, and I'm not surprised that she has been frightened to tell you about slipping up. 

She has lied to you about this because you have demonstrated your aggression and inflexibility on this issue - following her into the bathroom and demanding she lets you smell her breath is controlling and makes you sound like a bit of an asshole."
"Sure, she's allowed to wear whatever she wants.  

But by continuing to wear it after breaking her own promise about wearing it, what she's saying is ""The attention I get for how I look in this suit is more important than how uncomfortable it makes you feel that people can see my boob.""  Your choice is whether that matters enough for you to leave."
"The worst that happens to you in this situation is he sends you some nasty messages saying ""why did you wreck my marriage"" to which you respond, YOU wrecked your marriage"". That's it. What if they're trying to get pregnant and she's trapped with him forever? She still in her 30s she has time to find someone else and have a family. If it all blows up in his face in a year or two, that might now be the case. You could literally be preventing this woman from having a loving family. Grow a pair and help this woman. "
"I would wait just long enough that the courts will see that he is the primary caretaker or she could try to make it very messy.

"Tell him that you've never been with a guy before, and you're not really sure how you feel. Maybe he can help you figure it out. "
"As someone who moved across the country (legit east coast to west coast) it's going to be veeeerrrry pricey to move all your furniture. If I were you I'd see about selling it to your roommate? That's my only advice. 


Aside from that you don't owe her furniture. If you guys are on good terms maybe you can help her bargain hunt and go on Craigslist pickups with her. If she's mad.... so what! This is a huge opportunity and you should absolutely take it. "

"Exactly. If he's the right guy he still will be in two or three years when you've finished your degree and had the chance to live on your own outside of res, or with roommates, or travel, etc. There's no rush. Sex will still be there."

Tell her your suggestion wasn't constructive.

"I'm stuck on that as well. Sounds like R has an inferiority complex, and I'm betting he'll soon also have a divorce to go with it."
"If they split up your father will have to pay child support &amp; alimony. This will have to be an amount for her to support the both of you on (assuming your dad leaves &amp; you stay with your mum). 

He can't threaten her with this as they're married. 

I hope this gets sorted out soon, I'm really sorry dude. "
"Wait, getting pregnant with your fourth child 2 months after meeting the father isn't prudent??"
"Yeah. :( it's really psyching me out that would would try to do this to me. I tell ya, you try to love and support someone for years and they try to take a dump on your life/steal your man when they get the chance. I feel heartbroken honestly.

And enraged. I didn't grow up in the best area and this would be something that would easily warrant a physical alteration but i decided to leave that immature attitude behind! No point in getting into trouble. But man...I'm so hurt."
"I agree with the previous two commenters. OP  it also sounds like when he asked you if you loved him it broke your heart, which speaks to me like you have a large amount of empathy for your son which is love in a way. I think you do love him, but you are in an incredibly stressful situation and depressed. Young kids are tough to take care of but wait for your kid to grow up a bit more and he might become your best friend. 

On another note, it seems like a lot of your post comes across like you are pretty depressed and I think with a better social life with a community of parents that you get along with might help with your mental state. It sounds like your incredibly lonely and that might be making you resentful of your situation and are thinking it's your sons fault. If at all possible, it sounds like you need a better social circle and friends and you'll be happier. Does your kid play sports or any sort of activity where you could meet other parents? Rather than your son being the problem, he might be the gateway for feeling better about your life by meeting other parents/friends. 

I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way and we are all honored that you were vulnerable enough to share this with us. Thank you for sharing and I hope it works out. It sounds like you've been an amazing mother, but need more support from a community (since you're lacking a partner). I know it sounds weird, but have you tried looking into some sort of religious community? I know a lot of people turn their noses at Christian communities, but metaphysics aside, people you meet there can be very caring and could help provide mental and material support. "
Don't worry about your friends.  Do worry about your potential/future daughter being around them.  And find out what your bf's plan for handling that is before you marry him.
"God. This made my stomach tie up in knots reading, OP. 

Can I say a few things? First of all, I like the idea of telling him how inappropriate his behavior was and how uncomfortable it made you, and that you are not reporting him to HR but *you reserve the right to in the future.* I actually think you're being lenient. I'd just report him.

I don't think you should say anything about a gun. It may be legal in your state to use a gun during a forced entry but that doesn't make it legal to threaten someone in advance of entry with the use of a gun. Honestly, the fact that you've even typed it out on Reddit changes the legality of it. 

In no way, shape, or form do I think that any of this is your fault. But in the future: when an unwanted houseguest tries to push his way into your home, be clear. Don't close the door behind you. Stand there at the front door, with it open, and tell that person that you didn't invite them into your home. Ask them to leave. If they refuse, explain that you will call the police. 

If that person returns to your home a second time and knocks on your door, don't hide or ""open the door just a crack while pretending to be on the phone."" Tell them loudly from behind that door that the police are on their way. If you're feeling extra bold, actually do just call the police! 

Read ""The Gift of Fear."" Everyone on Reddit recommends it all the time, and I finally read it, and it really is worth the hype.

"She's berating him into *going into even more debt*.

The phrasing just bothers me, but you can't spend money you don't have. She doesn't want to spend money. She wants to go into even more debt on top of the debt they, and she, is already under, in order to buy some furniture.

That's ridiculous."
That is way better phrasing than what I came up with hahaha
"Real talk, you relationship sounds *so fucking exhausting*!

####You are overextending yourself

This ""devoted"" and ""catering to his needs"" dynamic is how you are showing your love but **it's not reciprocated by him**. Furthermore he expects it now so doesn't value what you do for him. Meanwhile you're hoping your *acts of service* will make him indebted to you.. Nope!

&gt;He turned turned around went to sleep as if I was the freak. And **left me to self-soothe. Something he does quite often.**

How's that working for you?

That sounds cold and like he doesn't care if you're hurting. Do you still feel this is a great relationship?

Bottom line, it sounds like he cares about you and is comfortable with you -- but he doesn't sound like he has much passion for you and *isn't into you all that much*.. 

I would advise ending the relationship. But if you're determine to stay it's time to have an honest chat about feelings. Or at the very least, pull back and don't keep doing so much for him to see how he reacts."
"There's literally no way for you to prove what he's doing in there, and you're going to make yourself look like a total moron to management if you go to them with this."
"Further to this, there was a study a while ago where a police force decided to start treating domestic violence abusers the same way they would criminals.  Which is to say, they started tracking the abusers, looking for history and priors.

What they found was that DV abusers went through a ridiculous amount of victims - something like 10+.  And that they had a distinct victim profile.  

The one case that stood out for me was an officer saying they tracked a previous abuse victim down and when they appeared at her doorstep, her first words, basically was something like ""Oh no, who did he kill.""  

Which is to say, if you've been abused, stop arguing with yourself - report the abuse and the abuser.  Because your abuser WILL go on to their next victim, and then another one after that and another after that.  They'll keep doing it until somebody reports their behaviour - or somebody dies."
"At this point I think you need to call CPS. There are some real downsides to this, but what she's doing is negligence and may amount to criminal negligence. You need some actual competent non-addict adults involved here."

Your cursing and typing in capital letters mean nothing.  I will tell you why.  You are still claiming responsibility for the dogs.
"Even extremely intelligent people are not rational about religion. This conversation has to happen, but isn't going to end well, most likely. My Catholic mother cried for days when my unwed sister became pregnant with her planned and wanted child. It's not about the daughter, it's about the mother feeling like she failed as a mother to raise her child on her religion. She has failed in the eyes of her god. Then she will question ever parenting decision she's ever made, including moving to America. This is much heavier than it appears on the surface. "

"Lying in court is committing perjury, which is a felony and lands you 5 years in jail.

"Plus one for DO NOT GO TO HR. 

This happened on personal time, outside of work and she does not even work for the company. 

HR is there to protect the company from liability. They are NOT a referee or therapist or independent third party or a mandated reporter or there to protect the employee (that's what a union does)."
"I'm siding with your ex's new wife here.

You seem concerned that your ex has moved on 'quickly' yet you've moved in and had a child with another man. A child is much more of a commitment than marriage. Why the double standard?

The words you use to describe her and you dismissing her feelings about her snubbing her from the family party, are really telling. If we can pick this up with a couple of paragraphs then she is definitely picking up your vibes. 

Also rubbing your ex's shoulders in front of her, stop marking him. It's odd. Whether you're doing this consciously or not, you're marking your territory with your ex and sending his wife a message. "
"I've read accounts here on Reddit written by sugar babies in which they say they were not required to have sex with clients and it was more that the client was looking for companionship. 

So while it is possible that your girlfriend is telling the truth that there is no sex, personally I think it's pretty unlikely. 

Hopefully there will be some sugar babies reading this who will be able to weigh in on how likely it is that this relationship is a platonic one. 

Were you aware that she was in this sugar baby arrangement before she went away? 

Are you sure that this isn't just another boyfriend she has on the side?

I think that where you go from here depends on a number of factors. 

Are you comfortable with her being in a platonic sugar baby arrangement (assuming that is the truth). It's OK to say no to that. 

If she has lied about sex being involved, do you want to stay with her?

You are the one who gets to decide where your boundaries are. If you feel uncomfortable with something you are entitled to feel that way.

"I allow myself one petty moment per day.OP, sick this asshole's wife on him."
"There are guilds in WoW, as an example, where *you have to go through an application process to join*, and that's if you're even accepted in the first place. People can draw a fine line between competitive and casual. It sounds like John hadn't even played much casual games with you before insulting you for denying him entry. You're serious about your team and you need some time before bringing him in. You want the team to accept him,  or just you, and that takes time.

I mean, all John is doing here is showing you that he probably isn't going to be a good teammate. There are friends of friends that I don't play with because I think they are assholes. Guess where John would fall? John is the type of guy who runs  in solo and then yells at the healer for letting him die, as far as I can tell. 

Maybe he's a great player - so what's wrong with proving himself in casual play first? Someone who is really good, and wants to join a *team*, is going to be patient and considerate, and look forward to pubstomping to showcase their skill. Like, I love playing support when my teammates are good - and my friends love when I heal or tank specifically because I play that well, while they murder shit around me.

Is Jane really going to let her BF called her friend a bitch? I get he is upset, but whatever - people say no all the time in these type of games, and are normally selective about who they group with in competative play. For someone who should understand this, John is being a salty jackass about it. Him dating your friend doesn't mean he is judged by a different standard and doesn't get him an auto invite. He wants to play, then ya when it is casual. 'I am in a serious group right now and we do not have an opening,' comes with the territory. John needs to grow up."
"I have a small home, no kids, no pets, and it is a lot more than 1 hour of cleaning a week...."
"Note, I'm not trying to be an alarmist, just sharing my experience....Others mentioned this but it sounds like the starts of an eating disorder or an anxiety/control related disorder. My family discovered my sister's ED because she was only eating specific steamed vegetables (broccoli and spinach) and the occasional sweet potato. She would want to be around food though, and would be over my shoulder while I was cooking but as soon as I suggested her having some of my meal she would clam up and say 'I'm just not that hungry' or 'I had a big lunch'. We discovered she was bulimic soon after when she started throwing 'unhealthy' food out when it was still packaged. It's a tricky disorder to figure out because it can be linked to so many other disorders (anxiety, OCD, anything with dealing with lack of or wanting more control, etc) and those who have EDs are smart and hide it however they can. The other issue is you can't just tell someone they have an eating disorder because that just opens a crazy can of worms. I'm not saying your wife is absolutely suffering from an ED but I would consider it...I would advise you to keep tabs on how much she eats, what she does after she eats, and how she responds to other foods...read between the lines. We missed so many things that my sister made obvious because we just assumed 'oh I ate a big lunch' meant exactly that when it actually meant 'I haven't had food since last night and I'll be damned if I eat your buttery/cheesy/oily/ fatty/carb filled...etc etc etc) food' or how she would always go to the bathroom/take a shower/ go for a long run after eating (she is also an over exerciser). I COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG...but having lived it first hand with my sister (and still living it four years after the fact) it's a scary thing when you realize you missed the signs. Be on alert but don't be alarming to her because if she does have an ED she can, and will, change up her habits if she suspects you really know. Proceed with caution and if you really start to feel this is the case I would consult a professional and get their opinion before you do anything else. Sorry this is so long btw. "
"So after he found out as a man near 30 that hes dating a teenager, he decides its appropriate to continue? Also, you told him you dont like gifts and he doesnt listen to you? Shocking...."
"Bouncing off of this, don't treat him and your brother like their only interesting quality is being gay. "
well you certainly hit the nail on the head with that one. 
"I think this is something that everyone will vary on and you may just be incompatible. You seem to have more of a ""I'll go with your want or need only if it already suits what I want"" type of attitude, whereas she has what I was raised to call a 'courteous and polite' attitude. ~~It doesn't mean either of you is wrong, it's just different expectations.~~ When I re-read it actually I think you are taking her for granted.

For example, I will ask my fiance things like ""what do you want for dinner tonight between x, y or z"" or ""do you want the pasta to have a lot of garlic or not much"" - this isn't _omg I can't make the decision_, and it's not me 'neglecting my own feelings', I just don't have a strong preference, so if he does it makes sense to go with that. It's not an excuse to then say ""oh but since you care about my opinion I thought that's what we were doing, I didn't realise I had to care about yours too"". She's not being 'needy' she's being polite. And the fact that you clearly mention you love that she cares about you and listens to what you want but can't be bothered to do the same for her seems pretty telling.

If I then tell my partner I do have a preference on something, like getting in to the bathroom first at bed time, it would be completely rude for him to ignore that unless he also has a strong preference and we can't compromise. Or if I ask him to do something or if we can have x for lunch or whatever, he would listen. IMO it's total BS to say you're ""just not wired"" to pay attention to your girlfriend and give a crap what she wants or cares about - you need to _make a point_ of listening to her and caring otherwise why are you with her?

Also for your birthday dinner example - in my family/culture it's considered super rude to bail on a birthday dinner unless you barely know the person or you're genuinely busy or ill. Being 'tired' would be seen as a weak excuse that basically means ""I don't consider you deserving of any effort or thought from me"".

So it seems like you've both just grown up with different expectations on how people both inside and outside relationships should behave towards each other, and you may just not be compatible this way. "
"Coming from another Muslim, one way I explained not wanting to wear Hijab to  my mom was the entire concept of hijab in Islam is more than headscarf, It's how you conduct yourself, how you live  your everyday life according to Islamic guidelines/principles.I tried wearing it for a short while but I felt like I was being an imposter in some ways because most of the other hijabis I knew were much more properly Muslim.It kind of felt like half-assing a fast to me, better not to do it at all than to do it half heartedly.My mom.luckily understood it wasn't a rejection of the religion/community but an identity thing.I think you need to be honest about your feelings with your mom and assure her it's not a rejection of her (since she ties her identity so closely to religion).Also  maybe bring up that in the  current climate being a hijabi isn't the safest thing "

"A few observations.

First, if what you said about them is true, the company should know it.

Second, the fact that they fired Mike and Lisa almost immediately probably means this was not the only time they heard about it, and they were on the fence about firing them.

Third, they would be bad managers/bosses. That is their own fault. 

Last, no, honesty isn't the best policy here. Spilling the beans would be a mistake. They're drinking and raging, and you're their roommate.

"Your wife is feeling disrespected  as a wife and mother, which is why she's being cold to your mother. And rightly so, in my opinion.

Put yourself in her shoes without blinders on. Think about how it would feel to go to a huge family gathering, and not understand a word, or be able to talk to anyone except you for hours. 
Think about how disrespected you would be feeling if you were treated the way your wife has been. Think about how you would feel if your wife invalited your feelings by saying ""deal with it, it's just how my mother is"". 

You need to climb over the fence you are sitting on, and stand with your wife. You two are a united front. If she is feeling disrespected, then you need to stand up for her. 

Once that happens, you can work on your family and how or if you can repair the relationship between your wife and mom. In the mean time, take your kid over to your family and leave your wife home. It's what she wants.

"It may be an actual phobia, and she may have been having a panic attack. I have an unrelated phobia, but I'm not really in control of what I say or do when I'm in the midst of a panic attack. It's truly not personal. I'm sure she was panicked  (and then embarrassed)."

"Urgf this is so true! When I first met my husband, it was in a place where we both were only working for the winter. He asked if I wanted to come and live with him, where he's from, for the summer. Of course I agreed, I couldn't wait a whole year until winter rolled around again to see him, so I went with him... I hated it here!

I had these romantic ideas on how it would be like, living on the beach. But I hadn't taken into consideration, that's it's his home town, and therefore he knows everyone around here, and had his usual routines/habits, and I felt like OP, an annoying intruder. A  bit like a leach, leaching on to him. I felt I lost my independence, and my personality. Instead I became ""[husband's name] wife. - the girl that doesn't even speak the language!"" My whole identity gone out the window! 

Every time I was home alone, I felt abandoned. 

... im not sure what exactly changed those depressing times, maybe the fact I started getting to know the language better, or that i made my own friends. Ever so often I will have a little fit, about not ""owning"" anything of ""my own"". And then I'll go out and buy what ever it is. Like a blanket to throw over the couch, since none of the furnitures are mine. Or I would buy some bedding. Or even just a neat little tea towel. 

All these things makes me feel at home,  when I look around our apartment, which isn't my apartment at all! 

And I've gotten my own habits and routines. They don't include my husband, which also have given back my identity, or at the least, have made me independent again. 

I got a whole new identity now, it's no longer me or I. It's we and us. And I think that took a lot longer for me, to feel comfortable with, that I like to admit. 

I was very independent before I met him, so that was also partly why I had such a hard time, I think."
"Don't soften up.  

&gt;It's always hard to cut loose from something you're so used to and gotten comfortable in.

Keep in mind that he is used to and comfortable with treating you the way he has.  He knows he can verbally abuse you.  He knows he can bring women home with him anytime he wants with very little blowback.  (Heck, even his excuse there sucked.  He set an alarm to try to have her out before you would notice??!)   He knows he doesn't have to give up his drinking.  He can go without for a short time and throw it in your face when he starts back up.  He knows that, if things eventually do go south enough for you to leave, he can just threaten to harm himself and you'll be right back.  He is comfortable with things exactly as they are.  He doesn't listen to you when you tell him things need to change.

Listen, if your worst flaw is that you're ""pretentious"", I'd pick a partner like you over one like him any day of the week.  Honestly, I don't even think you're pretentious.  You're just a full grown adult that appreciates hard work and expects your life partner to put some effort in.  He doesn't do that, and I really don't think he ever will.  

You need to leave this mess."
"Send her a message that you'll help her move in exchange for your tools back. Every last one of them. No tools, no help. Hire a moving company in her name and show up at her door. She hands over the tool, she signs the moving paperwork, you sit back and watch before paying the bill."

It's all about the suspension of disbelief, and I guess that#s what your wife is inflicted with -- except in this case that's not just any stud on screen, it's her hubby.

I can't offer any advice here, but I thought I'd point that out. It seems that your wife never stopped to think about the engineered nature of the narrative, she likely just wanted to enjoy the show for what it is, and got a startling impression that has unsettled her and is still lingering, after the credits. It'll take time, but you've gotta stay strong and help her through this because who else can?"
"Cleaning isn't a fun hobby you get to prioritise when you're living with someone. It's a necessity.

Just put your empty soda in the bin for gods sake. She isn't asking you to scale Mt Everest, she's asking you to do your share of the cleaning.

She asks how your day went? ""It was fine.""

She asks for details about anything? Bare minimum. All work-related.

Paint the walls grey until she goes storming out because she didn't get to throw red paint at you and have you throw blue right back. Never be terse, never make it obvious what you're doing, just give her literally nothing to work with until she looks ridiculous for trying to dig for more.

The funny side-bonus is that doing this makes people like this *go absolutely nuts.*"

"&gt;Our parents have even said that shes the ""genius of the family"" and that Im the "" beauty of the family"" but not ""nearly as clever"".

There's some messed up family relationships here. I wonder if she's got a hangup about being the ugly sister, and is idealizing your life. It sounds like she has a major thing for your ex, and sharing information and pictures about you is her way to get closer to him, in some sort of creepy, misguided attempt to get him to like her. I mean, she was doing on that on WhatsApp secretly without telling you. It's completely and totally inappropriate, but it could have started innocuously a long time ago, and then she gradually got in over her head. 

I would make a big blowout with this to your parents, just to give her a reality check on how serious this is. She is sending BIKINI PICTURES to your abusive ex...that is totally out of control. 

Then, information diet and get her out of your life. Lock down Instagram and Facebook and remove her as a friend, don't see her except at purely necessary family functions, and don't tell her anything at all about your life. I'd keep info you give to your parents minimal in case they tell her. She might find that when she has no info to give your ex that he is less interested in talking with her.

Last, if ex continues to contact you, get a restraining order. He's been harassing you for a long time, this is definitely overdue."

"The problem is that you're trying to be ""logical"" and ""solve problems"" when she's trying to make an emotional connection, feel heard, and get her needs met. As long as you keep trying to be ""logical"" instead of actually listening then you are going to have this problem. You need to show empathy and help her feel heard before offering *any* suggestions. After she feels heard and has her feelings acknowledged, she'll likely be more open to problem solving, or may initiate it herself.

"Keep stressing that this isn't just about you having to clean up after the dog.  It's about the dog's quality of life.  If the dog is in so much pain that he can no longer get enjoyment from his life, then that's not life.  That's just existence.  To prolong his suffering would be cruel.  Maybe take videos of the dog and show him how much he's suffering.  It will be hard for him to watch, but for the dog's sake, it's necessary.  You see it every day.  He needs to see it, too.  

Don't put the dog down without your husband's okay, but you need to keep pushing the issue.

"OP, I have a cousin who had to have an organ transplant as a baby. His immediate family never treated him like a normal child. He was overprotected and given special treatment throughout his childhood, and prevented from having normal interactions with his peers.

It sounds like you and your wife are good parents. Please keep doing what you're doing. Let your kid be a normal kid as much as that's possible. I'm sure that your brother means well, but his suggestion is misguided, and possibly even dangerous to your son's well-being in the long term."

"Please listen to me. I don't want to freak you out needlessly, but I think it is a tremendous mistake to think he won't get violent when you end things.

Last week, a man in our neighborhood shot (he was very drunk) his fiancé in the head when she went to his home to break things off. This is a good neighborhood. Everyone's reeling on the cliches of ""oh, his house was so quiet! I've lived here my whole life, I just can't believe this!""

I am not saying this to just scare you for no reason, I'm saying this because it is a reality of how violent, selfish, manipulative men (and women) do react when the person they enjoy controlling most decides they're done putting up with it.

You know, personally, first hand, that he enjoys beating, injuring, and killing animals. That's beyond a red flag. That's him screaming in your face through a megaphone that he's capable and even willing to hurt you. This entire post is ""red flags,"" but that one should be enough!

He has been manipulating you throughout this entire relationship, and he is not going to be happy that you're standing up for yourself and taking away his favorite human toy.

Please, please, consider contacting an abuse hotline before you go through with this. Common advice of course is to not break up in person and to stay somewhere safe with other people after you breakup on the phone. Do you have any family to stay with? And who can come with you to get your stuff if you need it (I assume you do).

Contact a hotline and find out your options. If you don't have anyone to stay with off the top of your head, don't act until you do have a plan.

Whatever you do, do not be with this man alone at all for ANY reason to break up with him or after you have broken up with him.

Nothing in this situation is more important than your life and getting away safely. Not his feelings, not your reputation among his friends, not your belongings. It's you!! Protect yourself!"
"That's a good idea. I do have to ""work"" on my laptop and so she'll have to give me my phone tomorrow for work, I'll see if I can connect with my brother since my fiancee won't be here yet tomorrow.

I was like ""yeah, I get like that when I'm tired and hung over too!"" but then everyone else thought her crying was suspicious. If that was a reason to be suspicious, my husband would think I've cheated every time I've had too many g&amp;ts. 

I'm glad it was nothing, man. "
"Your title needs to be edited to say ""My husband doesn't contribute in any way...""

Either way, if its up in the air like that he's going to have to put all his damn ducks in a row and figure something out. If he keeps his job, great, but if not this can't fall on you and especially not when you're pregnant.

""I'm so lucky to have such an amazing girlfriend."" She does something silly? ""I love what a goofball you are."" First thing in the morning?

Oh honey.... This was a bad, bad idea. Was her mother also there, or did your wife have to spend her postpartum period trapped in a house alone with a woman who told her a year prior that she should not have kids? 

&gt; 7 months later mom comes again

&gt; she no longer feels comfortable staying at our house and hasn't been for several months. 

Your poor wife. Staying, as in overnight? With a woman who is constantly criticizing her parenting and excluding her from family activities? If it were your wife posting I'd ask her if you were married to your wife or married to your mother. It was very kind of her to offer to let you take the kiddo to visit without her. That would be a hard no from me, because in my experience people who make those passive aggressive digs in front of the parents also tend to shit talk the parent to the child when the parent isn't around. "
"You're not being paranoid. To me, the absolute worst thing is your last bullet point. The Santa thing happened in her childhood, and if she doesn't want to lie to her future kids, that's her decision. Needing a lot of attention and being argumentative is something you **could** be fine with; some people actually like that. Her competitive behaviour could qualify as a quirk if it isn't too important to you. But there is **no bloody way** the last point isn't a red flag.

I know people like that myself. People who lost friend after friend for ""no reason at all"". People everyone hates ""because I always win and they're envious"". People who got left again and again by their exes and ""never did anything wrong"". Those are the kind of people who just lack even the most basic degree of introspection and self-analysis. Everyone else is at fault, and they themselves have no idea why everyone hates them. This **is** a pattern, OP, and it isn't a good one. She doesn't even seem to be interested in finding out if maybe, just maybe there's a pattern. If there's a chance it's actually something she does. No, she's very comfortable in her role as the victim, and that's not going to end well.

I'm not part of the crowd who suggests dropping people like they're hot because there's a tiny problem. Not part of the ""Oh, look, a problem. Dump her."" crowd. I'm careful when it comes to suggesting something drastic like that. But in this case I'm telling you: this isn't going to work. She's not an adult. She doesn't take responsibility. Don't do this to yourself, especially not after an ex with BPD. You already know how that's going to end, mate.

If you desperately want to give this a shot for some reason, try talking to her. I'm pretty sure she won't listen, but maybe her reaction will be the last straw you need to call it a day. Even if you talk to her in the most understanding way possible, completely rational and friendly, and tell her there might be a pattern, ask her if she's sure it's not about her... She's not going to react well. I could be wrong, but I highly doubt it."
"It's pretty normal to notice other women, and even to have what could be called a mini crush on someone.

By extension, it implies he values you less or thinks that you are less sweet because you have sex.

This is manipulation. He's trying to get you to step down and beg him to continue questioning your plans.

&gt;I have legitimate concerns, you just don't like that I have a different opinion from you

His opinion was not sought, nor is it relevant at all. You made a decision with the input of the homeowner, it's not really up for discussion is it?

I'm not sure what to tell you. I guess I probably wouldn't respond when he second-guesses you. He's definitely over-stepping boundaries. Maybe you should make the boundaries crystal-clear.

*Boyfriend, I approached you with this information because I like to share positive things with you.

"Yeah this is way, way shitty of him.

It's cool to be a person who doesn't do monogamy. It's also cool to open up a closed relationship after a period of monogamy (that's how most open relationships start).

It's NOT COOL to act like being monogamous is some huge burden you bear for the other person, and that you deserve a parade for keeping it in your pants, when you agreed to do that of your own free will.

The problem isn't that he's non-monogamous, it's that he negotiates relationship issues like a bully. That's not a good dude to explore non-monogamy with at all. Lots of honesty, trust, and respect for boundaries are required for functional open relationships. This dude is selfish and pushy."

It's very bad behaviour on their part, and to expect proper paying tenants to do major home improvements for them is also inappropriate and an imposition.

Of course, you have rights as tenants, but I'm sure you'll want to be out of there ASAP (I know I would). If there's any letter-writing to be done, please leave that to your bf as it's his awful parents that are the problem here. Best to just be supportive of whatever he chooses to do. Good luck!"

"I spend a lot of time on /r/legaladvice, and if I have learned anything it is that there is a very blurred line about what constitutes a tenant.

It can take an upwards of 30+ days to evict someone from your home if you have to go that route, and during that time you live with some random psycho you haven't yet met off tinder.

Under no circumstances would I give this guy my address, and definitely would not open the door for him when he arrives. I would make it clear, via text or email that I can show a police officer when the time comes, that he cannot stay and should make other plans. Just in case he shows up at your door and tries to lie and say he's already staying there and you just locked him out (which, surprisingly, can also make life really hard for you depending on the circumstances).

Nope out of the whole situation and cut contact from this nutcase quick!"
"Who cares if she cries? She isn't doing is because she is sad, she is doing it because she knows it will make you do what she wants you to do. Stop falling for her manipulation and take a break from your family. 

Focus on your friends, job, school, whatever. Take up a new hobby. Stop talking to your parents and family as much and if you have to tell your family that if they won't drop it you will stop speaking to them all together. "
"Let's ignore the ""pushing you down"" thing. If that is *all* he did, you might overlook it as him being afraid. I got knocked on my ass by someone trying to get away from a spider, because they were phobic. 

The issue was how he behaved after. If he had been fearful, it would have been one thing. But instead he chose to berate an employee and demand they compensate him for a relatively small incident. No one was hurt [minus your pride and bottom] and yet he is standing there screaming at someone to make it better for him.

That is not the sort of partner I would want to have. Someone who takes any little inconvinience and turns it into a memememe issue. 

So no, I don't think you should continue to date this guy."
"I actually agree with the day off. The vet industry is high burn out because it's emotionally draining, you don't make much money and you're putting in a lot more work than you're being paid for.

A day off a week would just ensure that she doesn't burn herself out early on and it'd teach her that it's important to take care of herself. It's not changing yourself to take a day off a week. "
"Wow, I like mayonnaise but this guy apparently eats it with literally everything.  Bacon and mayonnaise? Spaghetti with ketchup and mayonnaise?  Disgusting.  Sounds like he's got the palate of a six year old.

Anyway, personally it'd be a dealbreaker for me.  But you didn't ask about that, you asked for suggestions as to how to get him to try new foods.  Quit asking, start making.  Hide the mayo and just make some new dishes.  If he won't taste it eat it yourself while talking about how delicious it is.  Do the same thing the following night.  IDK what else to say."
"I would probably send the money back in a check with a note saying ""I'm embarrassed I ever asked for or accepted this money, and I apologize for taking so long to give it back after not putting it to its intended use. Thank you for your generosity."" And leave it at that. Don't send anything long with explanations because it just sounds like excuses. It is rather cringey you did it in the first place so hopefully a short respectful note will at least show you've grown up a little. "
"Total honestly? This sounds like a blessing. Your dad is clearly prejudiced. Enjoy your time with your sister, her partner and your nephew.

"My (8-year relationship) ex and I had planned a (nonrefundable) trip with some friends a year in advance. After we split, I started seeing a new guy and we had been dating for a couple of months at the time the trip was scheduled. No way to swap him for the ex due to restrictions, so it was either cancel and forfeit $2k or go with my recent ex.

Since it was already paid and friends would be there, I went anyway. My new boyfriend said it was fine and he trusted me and wanted me to have fun. He admitted later, halfway through my trip, that he had been wrong and it was stressing him out for me to be on vacation with my ex, even knowing that my goal was to avoid the ex as much as possible and just enjoy traveling, which is a really big hobby of mine.

When he told me he was upset, he knew I wasn't in a position to be able to come home early (for logistical reasons). He assured me he still wanted me to have fun, but thought it was fair to tell me that he was struggling with it. I really appreciated his honesty and tried to text him as much as possible and involve him with my trip through photos, videos, etc.... I sent him handwritten letters so he would know I was thinking about him.  He handled it by staying busy with his own friends and family, and we got through it. Still together several years later.

*Tldr:* Tell your girlfriend how you feel. Acknowledge that your opinion has changed now that she's away. It's better to be honest. If she thought you were okay with it, she may not have felt it was inappropriate to go. How she responds when you express yourself now is a good measure of how much she values your feelings and opinions."
"Yes, a month right before the first exclusion happened, R sent a group text to everyone that said he does not want to play with me there anymore. This text was sent around the time I decided to go no contact with R, which I also told to a couple of the group members because I thought they'd have my back. R used my no contact as a way to get the group members on his side, as he made it seem like I was the mean one in the group who hated R for no reason."

He said cards are stupid. 

I know that seems small to you but to me it was the most glaring problem I read. 

You said you like something. 

He said that thing is stupid. 

He doesn't respect you. He doesn't care about your individuality. He thinks he knows better. He wants you to be what he expects. 

4 years in you shouldn't have to even say what you like or don't like. He should know. But he doesn't know or care.

You're a girl shaped thing. 

Girl shaped things like diamonds and expensive gifts. 

He doesn't know ***YOU*** at all. "
"I was the first person to comment on your thread yesterday and I deleted the comment after I thought about it. I want to apologize for being such a downer, you have better judgment than all of us combined,  absolutely and obviously. I'm glad my pessimism at the very least got you to rally behind yourself and didn't ruin you in the end, you've been on my mind today. I even have anxiety as well, I know if I were in your position my comment would have flattened me too, I wish I could take it back and unfortunately the best I can do is just apologize sincerely.

Stay awesome and keep kicking ass. In the future I'll think more before I try to tell someone they need to keep it bottled up. What the hell was I thinking? I'm so relieved to see a happy update "
"That would be a great response to this. ""I dont want my godson around people like you"""

Stop seeing this guy too. You barely know him and already this situation's got red flags all over it.
Bullshit. Melbourne Central (a giant shopping centre) is adjacent to Emporium and QV (two other shopping centres). There are a number of options in all 3 to purchase baby clothes. I'm a mid twenties childless woman and I know this. You did not even remotely try to solve this yourself. 
"&gt; he enjoys sleeping in

who doesn't? except that he's 39 and he has a kid, so he's actually just a lazy asshole"
"I understand there are some deep feelings here. 

Is it possible that your feeling of not living him is simply because you have never been loved yourself? I don't say this unkindly. But how can you know what love looks like if all you have been exposed to is neglect and abuse yourself? 

You've cared for this child well. He's developed well, he's healthy and smart. That's not just the luck of the draw. And it's not just a sense of duty. I know it may not feel like it but that is love in itself; giving someone the best care you can.  

I understand the bond isn't there. I understand the deep resentment may run so deep it takes over. I understand that actions of tender love don't come naturally. But you're trying. It may seem ridiculous to set an alarm; but you do it because you know it's important. Your heart broke when he asked if you love him. Just because you cannot show it in traditional ways doesn't mean it's not there. 

I know you need to do what's right for you *and* for him; maybe your depression is so bad you need to consider adoption. But I am asking you to consider what that means. Remember your heart breaking when he asked if you love him?? If you adopt him out as a school aged child he is going to be asking that question the rest of his life. You may not feel a bond but he does. 

I'm not trying to guilt you. But I do feel like there are other options, than simply walking away. 

Would Tonya understand your depression and be willing to take him for extended visits so you get the time you need? 

"
"Get out of there. Your boyfriend's love and respect for you should not be conditional upon whether or not you make small mistakes. I would also argue that in the grand scheme of things, forgetting to set an alarm is basically one of the least big-deal mistakes a person could make and his reaction to your forgetfulness is totally out of proportion. Also, from your post, it sounds like his abuse is escalating over time. It will get worse. Your boyfriend needs to learn to control his behavior, but if I were you I wouldn't wait around for that to happen. "
"...and he seems to think that one hour of cleaning a week is enough. What? 

And he has a kid, and kids are a constant mess. All the time.

"Putting aside your jealousy...there are still red flags flying here.  What woman WANTS to be trapped in a cabin with her recent ex?  Dude, I usually made elaborate plans to avoid mine.  This is weird.

And it is a cabin, not a fancy resort or cruise with no refund policy.  She didn't HAVE to go.  She chose to go for a week with her ex.  Weird.  Very Weird.

You may not be an idiot who is being played or being cheated on.  But your ""girlfriend"" is a piece of work.  She is not a keeper just for her choices."

She's not wrong.

And anyone who says ""oh she's controlling"" has no sense of perspective. You have crossed a line, waaay over the line. No wonder she is hurt. Fuck, people have divorced for less. What you do is ABSOLUTELY agree with your wife 100% in every aspect of this and do exactly what she says and apoligise all the while."
"&gt; sending naked pictures of me to people without my permission

OF COURSE you think he's going to hurt you. He already has. PPD probably compounding your already-difficult situation as well. But the fact is, he sent naked pictures of you to other people without your permission. He corresponded with people on swinger sites again presumable without your agreement.

&gt; This is cross posted because the majority of responses I got to this post in another forum are telling me to leave him

I would agree with that to be honest. I know he promised not to do it again and you two managed to work it out, but there is a reason you still never feel safe. And it's a very legitimate reason.

Also btw reading your internal narrative you just sound so strong."

"A good therapist won't respond this way.

I've had terrible therapists. I've had great ones. One of the hardest things I've ever done is the decision to try again with therapy after a string of horrible experiences. 

It's your decision. Trust me, I understand that there are risks in confiding in a professional. But it can be life changing when it goes well.

Whatever you decide, I wish you the best. "
"&gt; His answer should have been, ""if SO is not invited to a family dinner, then I'm not going.""

When two people get married, they become each other's primary family. So yeah, if one can't come, then the other should not go either."
"He's not oblivious. You told him straight up to stop touching you and he continued. He completely ignored what you were telling him about what you are comfortable with. He's an adult, he knows what ""stop"" means. He just doesn't care what you want and that's what makes him so scary. "
"I certainly hope not, but now I'm not sure. For starters, my best friend is gay. Despite R's shitty attitude, he's a charmer and caught my best friend's attention for sure. At first I thought he agreed with R because he had a crush on him, but a week before my original post my best friend admitted to me that while he was attracted to guys, he said he finds me different from most girls and would love to have a relationship if I wasn't with my boyfriend. I really hope that's not the case though."
"&gt;He's not going to divorce me over it, there's more to our marriage than what I look like.

Attraction matters in a relationship. He already told you he won't find a heavily tattooed you attractive. A partner reacting to major body modification is totally understandable. 

And BTW, you're 15 years younger than him... I'm pretty sure your looks matter to him more than you think."
"I agree with this. I'd just be completely honest with her instead of trying to be sneaky about it. Helping with the move = you get your tools back. That's it. If she still seeks emotional help from you or tries to hold your tools hostage, then just drop the idea. You already decided once that dealing with her wasn't worth getting your tools back."

"Jesus Christ, that is terrible! And you said you were close to your mom growing up and the step dad treats you well, I'm honestly baffled. I would confront your mom about it. Tell her it upsets you that they leave you out, and if she says anything about you being an adult and independent, maybe bring up the fact that they invite extended family who I'm sure are also adults, what's so different about you? 

For me this would be a cut off worthy offense, or I would at least put mad distance between us, but I understand that with your dad mostly out of the picture that would be tough."
"My husband and friends have been more involved in my life than she has. Ive been feeling horrible because I haven't been sobbing or anything. I've just been thinking one step after another. Get back. Go to funeral. Comfort mom. Make arrangements.

"&gt;I looked through the itinerary and he obviously worked hard and somehow even paid enough attention and booked the exact hotels I've screamed about staying in. He has the time in the various towns perfect, so far he's booked amazing day trips and excursions. With minor variations, it's exactly what I would have booked.

That bastard!  /s

&gt;I probably said some wrong things because I called him an insensitive ass for surprising me and not letting me be a part of it. He asked if I was serious, I said yes that I've never been so mad at him (partly true). He's now mad at me for not appreciating his effort. 

Imagine planning an entire vacation and getting shit on for it immediately?  

OP, I can see your perspective (a little) but the way you expressed it to your husband and to the strangers at large here, you come off as unbelievably ungrateful, at best. "
"YEah he needs to cover that shit by himself. Wtf does he also throw away clothes rather than do laundry? Good containers are expensive. Also don't let him weasel out of it by buying cheapass containers to replace the nice ones you had, or try to argue you can just use leftover Chinese food containers. He needs to replace exactly what he threw out.  "
"I know, it truly was brilliant advice, and actually the *only* advice I got about how to move *forward*, I was ready to vomit if I heard another person say ""just give it time and it'll get better"". Ironically, I made a career in mental health while he autopsies the dead.

Shortly after I began feeling stronger and more capable, one of my friends' boyfriends broke up with him, blindsiding my friend and leaving us all in utter shock. I told him the same thing my friend told me and gave him the watch (I didn't exactly have positive emotions associated with it) on the condition that he passes it along when someone else needs it more than him."
"If a boyfriend said that to me I'd toss a drink in his face and say ""Hope that was interesting enough for you!"" And walk my ass out!!!

How irresponsible of him. He is *31 years old* and acting like a child. Is this someone you want to be with? Your ""come to Jesus"" talk with him may be this very discussion. 

You might want to list the options:
- take them with him to camping
- drop them off at some doggy hotel or whatever 
- split with him because *he doesn't even care about your aversion to pets*

And if he's not going to listen to logic... well, throw the biggest tantrum ever.

"Your sister and BIL owe you a ton, but I honestly think they'll fuck it up somehow. How did this creep get your number? 

As for the rumors? Don't address them until asked. Tell the truth as plainly and honestly as possible. That you rejected him, he got creepy (like seriously, how did he get your number?), and then he resorted to lying. If they don't believe you still, show them the texts."
"I live in New York and it costs a shit ton for basically everything. It could be possible they are living in a high cost of living area. But if not, then maybe she should consider downsizing on her spending. Many people here are too quick to suggest breaking up, and if they give a fuck about the relationship (which it seems they do) this could easily be worked out. "
"Oh, and then she stripped off all of her clothes and told me I should fuck her because I only see her as an object.

"My boyfriend knew a guy who was working in a regional area while his wife stayed in the city and once a month he was able to come down and see her for a weekend. Well, she told him she was pregnant and this guy didn't believe that his wife could get pregnant in the one-a-month weekend visit and he asked her for a paternity test. The wife said ""Fine. If the results come back and you're not the father, we're getting a divorce. And if the results come back and you are the father, we're getting a divorce.""
Moral of the story is that if you don't have trust in a relationship, you have nothing. You fucked up big time by putting your baggage on your wife. You can't be surprised by her reaction and if I were you, I'd be expecting her to file for divorce. I really don't see how you can come back from this."
"Get the job. You can't be waiting forever for that one company to make up their mind. Why isn't your boyfriend doing the same you did by looking for places in NY? This passiveness is hurting both of you, but only you take action?

"I think you're already doing a good job of respecting his boundaries and understanding his perspective, so that's great.  Making him more comfortable might be a relatively long process, so I would just advise you to be patient and discuss things with him.

"You're timid, and it shows.. that's why she's targeting you.  Bullies will pick on you until you stand up for yourself.  Express your annoyance with some emotion.

"I have read all your other posts in this thread and I see you are a genuinely good person with a big desire to help. And I say this with all respect - you are being taken advantage of by your bosses.

Most especially with this ""if you leave, she will hurt herself"". They are trapping you, and they are not doing their daughter any favours by embroiling you in this situation. Life has changes, people she likes will leave, and for them to let her see that tantrums get people to stay is just making sure that next time she will throw longer, louder, more violent tantrums. She needs to learn that people leave, being sad about it is okay, but being sad and angry doesn't make them come back.

This is not on you. You cannot spend the rest of your life there for fear of how the daughter will react. She is not your child, you are not responsible. Her parents are abrogating their responsibility for her. It is not your fault, but it also isn't your problem.

As for your coworker, they absolutely could ban this woman from the premises if they wanted to. It is NOT OKAY that they keep on squirming out of taking responsibility for you both. They are your employers, they have duties towards their employees and a safe working environment is surely one of them :-/"
"This is so weird, it's almost like they don't want you there or something which is crazy because other family members are there too! Do they ever give you a head's up? Is there any way when they mention going you could say ""oh, who all is heading there? I'd love to go"" ?"
"&gt;It also sounds as though the industry has protections in pace which makes it difficult for management to remove bad (for whatever reason) employees.

Depending on the size of OP's employer it was probably a sticky situation for them. There are job protections in place that prevent the firing of pregnant women/new mothers. 

Regardless of her actual qualifications for the job, firing Jenna so close to her return from Maternity leave could be seen as retaliatory/punitive and opened the company up to a law suit. Even moving her to a new, non-equivalent position is in kind of a legal gray area."
"If he is truly Ghosting you, you will not hear from him again.  Unfortunately, in this day and age, it is how more and more people deal with things that make them uncomfortable  (i.e. just don't deal with it).

Best you can do, since you may not get another reply from him, is to send him a message telling him that while you are not sure what is going on or what went wrong, if he does not respond by [date] you will assume the relationship has ended.  If he does not respond by that date, wish him the best and move on. "
"This is NOT ""just what husbands are like"".  He sounds emotionally repressed, and seems to be stonewalling you, occasionally branching out into condescending and insensitive territory.

"Hi, I have lived in a household that had 4 generations at one point, 5 adults one baby. There will be friction and that's ok! A good starting point for the conversation is just to start with 'there are a lot of us sharing this space'. Use the baby's impending arrival as a point of importance, say you want to sort out what responsibilities everyone has around the house. You could do a chore chart, but frankly it's sometimes easier to pick one job to do. Every adult should have a task, that in general, is up to them. And designate what things are personal responsibility i.e. laundry.

For my situation I was responsible for the minor care my grandparent needed, cooking tea and pick-up/vacuuming (+baby). My mum did the laundry (skin condition makes that difficult for me), my dad did the dishes/outside etc.

It worked really well; I got a break while cooking tea from bubs. My mum didn't have to rush to get tea ready when she got home from work and just relaxed with baby/a coffee etc. My Grandparent was able to live with family while going blind and deaf, and the household costs were lower. 

Multi-generation households are great for children and parents (or can be). Feel confident when you bring it up. You aren't bringing it up with malice, and it's reasonable. Be willing to compromise/find novel solutions. You may find providing a basket in the kitchen for dirty dishes will prompt the clearing of surfaces for instance. Find the system that fixes those areas, and have clear expectations as a household about what part everyone plays in making it a good environment."
I think family counseling is in order with someone specialized in PTSD (which is legitimately what you're experiencing).  It's also very uncaring of him to dismiss your concerns as hormones or PPD.

One, if I was dating you for years I'd be pissed to discover you had been faking our sex life the whole time, way more than I would care about the issue itself.

Two, if they are going to react poorly to your issue then it's better to know as early in the relationship a possible so you can move on and find someone else.

You should be able to find women who can work with this issue, there are lots of ways to have great sex that don't involve a continuously erect penis. "
"She asked for space and time and you gave her neither. 

&gt; ""I asked if I could see her at least, if we could talk but she refused so I called her.""

Do you not see the the problems inherent in this sentence alone? You write it as if it's the most normal thing in the world! 

Yeah, you're hurt... guess what? *so is she!* She needs to relearn how to trust you, and every time you invade her personal space (she tells you not to contact her, so you go visit her at her parents?!) you show her that you don't respect her choices or privacy.

"&gt; How about him? I'm assuming none of you are still in contact with him, but is there even a chance he'd cop to it?

He pleaded not guilty to the multiple offences he's been charged with. I'm not going to his trial, but honestly I would LOVE to know how the hell he would explain the evidence otherwise. 

Speaking of evidence, honestly I don't think anything I could do would be more clear-cut than what the police already has. The vet who did the animal autopsies took my sister in by herself and basically tore her a new one about defending this dude. They were each taken in for questioning for over three hours with the police. All this time alone with totally impartial people and still she denies it was him. Now she's started saying the police/vets have ""an agenda"" and it's about just getting SOMEONE charged, regardless of whether they're guilty. WTF? As someone who adores animals I just find it baffling she'd think this way. If it was anyone else being charged, she'd be disgusted with them.

She gets upset with us, her family, saying we've caused her all this stress and made her ill. But all we've done is say he's abusive, he's the one doing the actual abuse. She's behaving so irrationally, it's driving me mad. I just want to shake her sometimes :("
"&gt; why she wouldn't tell me how she did it.

Well I can answer that one for you:  because she doesn't want you to know how she did it.  Then you don't have a 1-up on her.

&gt; i tried to explain..

That doesn't work with parents like this.  When I [38m] was 19, I was kicked out of my Catholic parents' house because my girlfriend was ""too young"" (she was 17).  As I was walking out the door, my dad tried to get me to come back by saying ""well, you can stay here if you pay some rent"".  Let's just say I impolitely declined the offer and left.

Parents like this love you as long as they think they're in control of you.  That's probably why you're confused.  

In their defense, I will say they're correct on this point:

&gt; My parents decided that if I wanted to be treated/act like an adult, I should just pay for my own things and took away anything they paid for- no car, no cell phone, no college tuition, nothing.

There's really no getting around this.  If you want to live by your own rules, you need to pay for your own way.  They're wrong for not educating you about sex, but you're wrong for thinking that you have any leverage to get them to compromise on this point."

Her behavior is selfish and wrong, and will get worse if you condone it by staying with her as she continues to act this way."
"It really sucks that it has come to this... But a few things good come out of this. You see what a great guy you have... He is sticking thru with you thru all this. 
And you can see early on how toxic your parents are and start a new life and family with the great fiance you have

I really hope his mom's comes thru and things get better and sorry you are losing your parents in this... But I know I could never speak to my parents again if they ever put the guy I love in such a crazy spot of choosing."
"ah I see, well the freelance unfortunately might have to go to the side if you're really putting that many hours in and not getting paid enough.

How many hours do you put into it a night? Could it possibly be replaced with something more consistent?"
"Apparently not enough to do what it takes to fix the situation. She found a loophole where her and this guy were able to send each other nudes, sex toys, comment on each other and then fall back on ""Well anyone could look at it."" It's bullshit. 

She deleted her messages so you have no idea whether or not she fooled around with this guy, oh and they go out to have drinks and he gropes her. "
"I've been thinking about asking my friend to join me, I know he would if I asked. I did find a new group earlier today too, but the group is filled with women, so I don't know if he can join. Regardless, I'll still ask him and the group and see if we can make something work."

"*""He’s a nice guy""*

No.  He is not a nice guy."
OP i grew up evangelical and soooo many of my friends got married young for these exact reasons. don't do it OP. your sister is right. I know it's not what you want to hear but you will be a completely different person at 25 than you are now
"He shouldn't have said that. He probably meant it as a compliment but   didn't think about the implications. Tell him how his statement made you feel. Be as blunt with him as you have been here. How would he feel if you told him after sex that it was great, but you've had better with someone else? 
As hard as it is, it may also help to ask him what it would take to make it the best sex he's ever had, period? Learn from it, and put it into practice. Tell him what he could do to make sex better for you. Communication is necessary in order to improve both your sex life and your relationship. "
"Tbh it's considerably worse when you're involving real people. One of which is married, and you know it. Because you can fuck up their real relationships. I don't think this is cute, innocent wishful ""they'd be so cute together"" shipping, this is media being trashy"
"Agreed. I'm also a very jumpy person. My dad used to play pranks on me as a kid/teenager and my husband will occasionally startle me for a giggle. (Although in all honest, a lot of the time when he startles me, it's by accident) But if I *ever* told him it was upsetting me or *physically* left his company because he was doing it, you'd bet your arse he'd stop doing it. 

OP your bf is a jerk. He cares more about the entertainment factor of startling you than he does your feelings. It's time to reevaluate this ""great"" relationship. 

Edit: wording."
Wanting privacy with his phone is NOT untrustworthy.  
"IMO, you are 100% **not** overreacting.

This is just a bad recipe here. Do you think this guy who banged her for a while gives a shit about your feelings? No way. He's super down for an easy lay just like most dudes are.

The ambiguity of your relationship status is what is making this difficult. If you guys are 'coupley' then decide NOW if you are a couple or not. If she's your girlfriend, you don't want her sleeping under the same roof as an ex. Plain and simple."
"He is absolutely vile. You have a right to bodily autonomy and he is being a manipulative jerk, and not respecting your feelings – worse, invalidating them. And on what authority can he claim ""all women"" feel something. Start insisting he loves certain things that he doesn't because ""all men do"". And then leave his ass because you deserve better than this. I'm sorry you married such an asshole :("
"Are you really sure you want to marry this man-baby?

If you ever have a child, you will have to deal with the child and then him, because he is not happy not being the centre of attention. 

A marriage is a contract between equals. What you are heading towards, seems to be the attitude you will have to deal with your whole marriage. Do you want to be miserable?"
"Oh yeah, they know we live together and are discussing wedding venues, timeframe for an engagement/marriage etc. 

One of Jake's favorite things to say when his mom starts talking about Maddy is ""oooh, I bet the postage to get her wedding in invitation in the mail is going to be pricey all the way out there!"" or ""how many years in advance do we plan the wedding to make sure she can make it?"" It's hilarious because his mom just keeps talking like he sneezed versus spoke an actual sentence."
Strong boundary game. It's absurd his parents are prioritising their silly fantasy over his actual IRL choices.
"He's very good. He always compliments me to his parents (even though he knows it won't sway them, it just makes me feel good) and hangs up the phone or excuses us when they get to be too much."
"Yeah...this woman is not my mom. She has NEVER been like this in my entire life, she was the mom that everyone dreamed of having. I think that adds to my terror in all of this..."
"Just leave her alone. Don't over think it. She's not treating you like a creep... she's just treating you like someone she doesn't want to know, because she doesn't want to know you. I'm sure it's not personal. Or maybe it is. Either way, no biggie."
"Yeah, holy shit, that was amazingly supportive and empathetic of him."
"You know how he mentioned to Op that women are crazy? these comments 

&gt;He has made some uncomfortable comments about women and their intentions (""she is always on the prowl for guys,"" ""most girls are crazy,"" ""I hate when pretty girls get special attention,"" 

He sounds like an insufferable train wreck of a man. I mean let's be real- It's not even from a feminist VS mysogynist point of view, the man clearly has issues regarding trust, healthy interactions (he see's inferred meaning or motives in OPs actions and words). He's paranoid. He baits her with nice gestures then manipulates the situation to make it look like hes some big hero, either to quench his ego or inflict pain on OP on purpose (shudders). OP needs to know that these thing's aren't subconscious, they are deliberate attempts to wear her down and toy with her because he's a wreck.  

I honestly feel bad for the guy. And once OP dumps him when she reaches her boiling point and explodes at the absurdity being served to her, he will *actually* continue to tell future girlfriends and people that all women are crazy. Yeah, crazy because your batshit insane self drove them to desperate measures and reactions, lol. He's a sad little boy that's been scorned by women, has formed toxic views because he cant be a good sport, and now he's ruined. Forever projecting his own crazy behaviour onto the women he see's. Because everyone is to blame but himself. "
"I am so sorry for your ordeal. Is there anyone you can go stay with for a while, like a family member or different friend?

Please never talk to this arsehole again. EVER.

And I would also recommend some counselling. In the nicest possible way, you need to learn to be more assertive. This 'friend' has been treating you like dirt :( I wish I could give you a hug!"
"The idea of doing this big nice thing for you seems to make him happy, and it's something you've always wanted. I say go for it. "
"You ask him why the hell he has a naked picture of your wife on his phone.

You have no idea how that got there or if your wife was complicit in him even having that picture, you're jumping to conclusions at the moment. 

Regardless one if not both of them screwed you over. Ask them about it, listen to their response, and then make a decision to believe what they say and decide whether or not to keep the friendship and/or the marriage. "
He still lacks basic human empathy. 
"Well you just sound like a considerate person, and the fact that she felt bad makes you feel bad, which is a normal reaction. It's one thing to be rude and speak French with another person and exclude the 3rd party from the group, but that's not what happened here. 

In terms of comfort level, I don't know how much more basic you can get than let's read a book together. I haven't taken French in a decade but I could probably cobble that sentence together. "
"iirc, there is a study floating around that showed similar outcomes for children whose parents were happily together, those who were divorced but amicable, and those who had a stable one parent family. Basically, it's not worth it for your kids to ""stick it out"" - their lives are affected by the turmoil as much as the adults lives are. "
"This is pretty much how our conversation 2 weeks ago went. ""If you think I'm apologizing to him, you're out of your fucking mind. That's NOT NORMAL, JANE"" and ""I feel like I'm a crazy person here. Who the fuck does he think he is demanding an apology for invading YOUR privacy?""  I think you get the picture... :)"
If this post is any indication of how you speak to people and how you value them than yeah... I can easily see how she would have little incentive to genuinely open up to you. You don't seem to give a fuck about her needs and you can't can't seem to stop bulldozing over others over your needs. 
"Lol oh my god. Yeah... have a conversation with her when you're both calm and sober. But that is NOT a reasonable response from her, drunk or not."
"You're being gaslight by them.  They know they are in the wrong.

You're the one in denial, sorry to say."
"It comes down to respect. You did not give her a week to sort out her feelings for you when she kindly requested that you leave her alone so she could think. Instead you sent her texts and went to her parents house, her sanctuary, because YOU wanted to see her. The fact that you even asked for a paternity test shows that you needed therapy years ago. I don't blame her for leaving you nor do I blame her for wanting to stay away from you until this baby is born. At this point, all you can do is give her time and pray that she will talk to you later. Stop pushing her on wanting to reconcile because it will only stress her out further.


In the interim, you need to get therapy to work on your issues of mistrust. It is damaging your current life."
"Did you didn't accidentally stumble into college spring break party. Why do they need you there to get blasted. They seem pretty immature. 

Hope your wife doesn't always act like this but if she does sorry dude you did nothing wrong.  Serious question, is drinking always this important to this group.... they might have a drinking problem. "
"this was exactly my thought - at *best* he looks like an asshole for telling this story, but at worst people are going to assume he hurt her or did something else horrible during sex. the only rep he's ruining is his own."
"There is absolutely nothing wrong with bringing a kid to a restaurant where people are drinking in the US. You wouldn't generally bring a kid (other than, in some situations, a little one) to a straight-up bar. Pubs can be a gray area. Some are more restaurant-ish and some are more bar-ish. They're not as standardized as they are in the U.K. so sometimes it can be hard to tell what kind of environment you're talking about. Though given OP's description I'd say the school, not the husband, is off the mark here."
It's ironic that you literally did their finances when you were a child but they don't trust you to handle your own as an adult? Stop feeling guilty and create some distance so they realize you are a grown woman. 
"Also, its an actual thing among medical students/residents to end up breaking up with their partners, in favor of pursing better job prospects that are states away and different from what they originally planned with their partner. Med students/residents/fellows are ambitious people and one thing you gotta accept is that their ambition/job comes before you (or your career aspirations) do. That's why there's such a high frequency of break ups amongst medical students/residents. 

OP: If your BF wants to move to the opposite end of the country for residency, would you follow? And if he wants to move again somewhere else for a fellowship or his job, would you follow him again and sacrifice your own job? "
"So she has totally untreated depression, and, shockingly, it isn't getting better. Take having kids 100% of the table right now, and put an emphasis on getting SOME kind of treatment for a very serious illness. "
"Agreed and tbh I honestly didn't even read OPs reason as ""ugh they won't shut up"" kind of complaining like there's anything wrong with them. I'm pretty noise-sensitive and I would want my co-workers to still be able to chat and have fun while I work in quiet. "
"You can definetly do better.  No one and i mean no one should talk to their significant other that way, ever!"
"&gt; Given her track record lately, I'm more likely to trust my husband's recounting of events than hers.

Even though she came clean and he didnt until caught?

Shouldnt you at least HEAR her version?"
"Thank you. We were good friends before but we've really bonded over the last month. Partly due to the drama of the situation, partly due to watching Love Island drunk. "
"&gt; He wants me to cover all the bills/groceries while he pays for the mortgage. That way the house will be his and will remain his

Completely unacceptable and unfair. 

I don't know where you live and how marital assets work, but is it possible to specify % ownership of the house? Where I live it's pretty common to give the partner who did the downpayment a higher percentage.
For example, if you buy a 1M house and he pays 300000 down, instead of 50/50, can you put into the title that he owns 65% and you own 35%? If you were to sell the house right away for 1M, each of you would come out exactly with what you put into the house. And if the house appreciates, you both profit but he profits more than you. For this arrangement to remain fair, you both need to contribute equally to the mortgage, and to all other bills.

If he really wants to be the sole owner of the house, whatever you do, don't co-sign for the mortgage!!! A fair arrangement in that case would be that you split the (initial) monthly mortgage payment into the interest part and the principal part. You pay him half of the *interest* as rent, but you pay *nothing* towards the principal. So you end up paying less than 50% of the ""total"" mortgage payments. If you want to be really generous, you can calculate how large the mortgage - and therefore the interest - would have been if he hadn't put 300000 down and you pay him half of that.  
And of course, you split all other bills and groceries equally, or whatever is fair given both of your spending habits. So you're left with a substantial amount of money of your own that you can save/invest/put towards another house. Oh, and BTW, the paying 50% of the interest should be conditional on you being able to use 50% of the house. If he takes over all the rooms for ""his"" hobbies and moves his family into the house, you shouldn't have to pay 50%.
"
"Oh my god, just stop talking to him. This is sooo much drama. You guys are just not good together, and there is way too much hurt here. I know you're enjoying hurting him and making him jealous, but you're 29 OP. Stop playing these very high school games. I thought you guys were 19 or 18 until I checked the ages.

This relationship is a dying horse that you're slowly beating to death. Just kill it already and put it out of its misery."
"You are sounding way too dependent on him.

Your conversation might have been better but it's very normal to not go out together all the time when in a relation.

You say this

&gt; I didn't want to stop him from going really. but I expected some empathy about it. like acknowledge that I'm about to be left out, sleep alone, miss you, etc. his choice sucked for me and he didn't even care.

And right afterwards you say this

&gt; he sent me lots of texts and pics and told me loved me and all that last night. texted me this morning to say he's on his way back. we are going to ""talk"" tonight after work.

Sounds like he did care about leaving you alone, why would he text you a lot, even send pics, if it were otherwise?

Maybe another redditor will have a different view on this but I believe you are exagerating and need to calm down. This is nothing and it's very common in most relations."
"&gt; And where the hell is your husband? He can't do dishes or mop? The whole situation would cause too much resentment for me.

Tbh, if MIL and FIL are just sitting at home mooching off of OP and her husband, I'd expect them to be doing most/all of the housecleaning, especially since OP is due in 2 weeks. "
"Could be an easy 15 minute conversation.

""She's abusive to me and controlling. She puts an act when you're around"" or ""She's so annoying!"" Two very different types of conversation and warning signs. If he's behaving that way because she just annoys him, run for the hills."
"&gt; He mentioned today how he loves having a daughter and hopes we have all girls, and I saw that as the right time to tell him I can't go through with labor again. 

Hindsight is 20/20, but this was *maybe* not the right time. Approaching difficult subjects usually requires a very neutral situation where you're both calm and not busy; it sounds like he was definitely on an emotional high at that point.

I do think that your husband, like many husbands, is unaware of just how traumatic this was for you. Therapy would definitely be wise, and you could ask him to visit a session or two with you.

When he's calm, you can make it clear that you're very open to having a larger family, but you do not want to be pregnant again. There are many options available to people today.

And the truth is, he may be upset because some people feel like kids are only ""worth it"" or ""really theirs"" if they're from their partner's pregnancy. They see an adopted child or a baby born via surrogate as ""less theirs"" or ""not the same."" He may need therapy to understand and work through those feelings as well.

&gt; we agreed we would have at least two biological children.

You both made this agreement before you experienced pregnancy and childbirth. You have had a traumatic experience; he needs to consider that. It would be like if a couple said, ""We agreed we'd stay in X city for at least five years,"" and one partner experienced a lot of devastating events in that city, then wanted to move because they obtained a new, better job...but the other partner was just furious because ""you agreed!"" It's not considering context and reality.

Also, this:

&gt; I got a very fun call from my MIL asking why I won't give her any more grandchildren 

You two need to come to an understanding: you and your husband make decisions about your family, *not* your in-laws. And he needs to be in your corner. It's none of her business how many children you have or how you have them. She's raised her son--she's done now."
"Glad Shaun stood up for you, and I agree this guy was going way overboard.  After one week, he's picking a problem with a life-long friend.  

That said, I think Shaun should probably warn other boyfriends about this dynamic he has with his friends before he exposes them to it, and explain it preemptively.  "
It's really messed up that right now the fantasy that they've built up about your relationship is taking precedence over the ugly reality. 
"So? She reacted that way because she knew you would be angry with her. She was *frightened* of your reaction.

Look, when I met my boyfriend, he was a smoker. I didn't like it, and I encouraged him to quit, but it took him about three years to quit completely. When he slipped up, I would tell him that it was disappointing, but that tomorrow is a new day and I trusted that he would try again and do better. That is being supportive - it is not supportive to make it clear to an addict that if they have a setback, you will kick them out of their home.

If you feel that strongly about smoking, acknowledge it and leave."
"Alex just went along with the prenup, instead of vetoing the idea straight away? After you supported him financially 100% for over a year? Holy hell, you have bigger problems to worry about that your in-laws. If he doesn't stand up for you, he's not worth marrying."
"Couples can easily get stuck in the same patterns of argument, whereas a neutral third party might be able to suggest solutions to break the impasse.

"If you're at the point of ending a 9 year relationship over this, perhaps it is time to seek out a sex therapist or counselor. 

It sounds like you have tried to talk to her but the outcome hasn't changed. If you've tried for 9 years, not sure what other new ways you can come up with to talk to her. Might need a new perspective or an unbiased third party to step in. "
"The dogs are already here with us and his mother is on holiday, so I can't really say i'm busy now. I'm going to out for an appointment and maybe for lunch but overall i'll be at home anyway. Not long enough for the dogs to struggle.

I got angry and told him it wasn't on, but he just assumed I was joking around and that it'd be fine. "
"Don't debate this. There's no debate. You've laid down boundaries and you've said that YB needs more help and has some deep issues going on.

If MIL is going to fight you on that, ignore her. Your only job is to assert and defend your boundaries. Don't further escalate this into a family conflict. Tell her that you guys will agree to disagree but your boundaries stand.

Without your MIL on board (and she's in firm denial and will stay there, because YB's behavioral issues are a condemnation of her parenting), YB will not improve. You guys need to protect yourselves and your future family and make sure that his role in your life is extremely limited.

If you insist on furthering the debate, let your husband do it. You need to take a backseat here."
"if that account is at the same bank as your parents, it might be advisable to change banks. it's terrifying how far social engineering can get someone."
"""I married a fellow college student, but now all he does is drugs and playing RPG's *all* the time, while he's supposed to look for a job."""
"So when I work I am hardly home, about 1/2 of the time I will sleep at a coworkers house to save an hour in the morning on commuting.

I do my own laundry during that time because I need clean work clothes. While I'm at it I'll throw in towels and sheets as needed.

I eat 100% of my meals at work when I'm working so I don't eat any of the groceries nor do I cook. 

I'm sort of weird about sharing the shower so I give it a quick bleach scrub a couple times a week before I shower. 

I seriously get home, throw clothes in the laundry, take a shower, pass out, go back to work. I simply don't have time to leave a mess for him to pick up after me.

So yes, he is technically doing 100% of the chores when I'm working, but it's only cleaning up after himself.


When I am off, I am cleaning up after everyone. The two of them hand cook every meal and rarely leave the house when they aren't working. There is a much bigger mess to deal with when it is my turn to clean vs. when it's ""his turn."""
"1. Is your dog chipped? That might be good to do in this circumstance.

"Why, why, why would anyone want to relive the worst drama of middle school as an adult? These people are revoltingly immature, and your boyfriend doesn't have enough sense or fortitude to cut them out. So, dump him. I mean, you've tried talking to him, and he knows damn well they're terrible to you, but he's cool with this status quo. You can't control him or them, but you can control yourself; walk out and leave them to their mean, petty fun times."
"""*She knew how manipulative Tammy is, yet, she thought it was a good idea to confront me in front of the entire office, and then have the gall to talk behind my back to another coworker, whom I am close with as well.*""

Ehhh. *You* knew how manipulative and shit-disturbing Tammy is, and you still went ahead and gave a reason for the requested move that even in the best light made your coworker look less than great. And shit-disturber Tammy was never going to see it in the best light.

That uneasy feeling you had after you told Tammy? That's when you should've approached your co-workers and given them your story; you felt in your gut Tammy would spill.

"Your uncles don't respect your relationship at all and I'm with your gf that you should distance yourself from them as much as possible. Be civil with them at family events, but if they can't respect your relationship, then why should you make an effort to keep a relationship with them? Your family doesn't have to like your fiance, but they better respect her and that isn't happening. You need to set boundaries with your uncles and not associating with them for now doesn't seem like an unreasonable boundary after the stunt they pulled. 

If anyone in your family gives you shit, just tell them exactly what happened and that if they can't respect your fiance, then they can't really be a part of your life. "
"I understand the bed thing.

But what's wrong with him using poop bags?"
"It's not about whether you like gifts or don't like them, though. It's about him ignoring your expressed preferences and just doing whatever makes him happy.

He needs to start listening to you."

There's a sub called r/JUSTNOMIL that sees this type of behavior a lot. They call them 'mommas boys' because they will always choose their mother (or father) over their spouse and until they learn that marriage means creating your *own* family (making your parents and siblings *extended* family) then your marriage will continue to have these types of problems.

"It sounds like it would be better for you to look around for another job. This problem isn't going to solve itself, her parents aren't willing to upset her and have catered to her and her disability for so long she won't be accepting changes. The fact that she's disabled doesn't mean she can sexually harrass her coworkers. Which is also a term her parents should know about as employers. 

As much as they want to keep her socialized at their work, it's just exposing them to a lot of risks and costing them clients. She needs someone to be her carer and to play with her and it should be someone outside the workplace. There are also usually activities for disabled adults she could join, but one has to join specific organizations for that to get that arranged. At some point, those parents aren't going to be around to take care of her, what's going to happen then? "

You shouldn't be in the middle of this."
It's likely that the kid's reaction might be related to both the trauma he experienced before adoption and the relatively recent upheaval in his life of the adoption process. It's hard for such a young child to process that much happening all at once and I don't think that the reaction he had necessarily means he's going to grow up to be a sad loser as you predict.

"I think your husband is being criticised a little harshly here.

I was hoping not, I've invested almost 8 years into this relationship (I fudged the details in the subject line) but I don't think I have the energy left to continue. I've been blaming myself and...I don't think I should anymore. "

"&gt;A lack of romance after marriage is as cliche as sex dropping off.

And it's often the reason it drops off!"
"Tell her ""if you are asking this, then you shouldn't be marrying, clearly you're going to regret it""

It's probably not about you or anything. Sounds like she wants to make sure if she is making a mistake."
"&gt;Is this a normal thing to do? Do you check your SO's phone?

Not even once in five years.  I can't even imagine asking. "
So the irs forged his birth certificate and wiped his parents memories of when he was born? That's the only way I can imagine not knowing your age being referred to as a tax issue. 
"I have herpes and I only recently found out in February when it was hurt horribly to pee. My boyfriend does not have herpes. We have been monogamous for over 2 years and I have not cheated on him.

You can contract herpes and not have any symptoms EVER. Sometimes the symptoms show up months or years later from the contraction- most immune systems are pretty efficient at keeping it under control so someone can have herpes for years then one do undergo a surgery or have the flu and their body isn't as focused on fighting the herpes and thus get symptoms for the first time. 

Here's how it went down with my boyfriend:
1.) We were having sex and it hurt a lot. I figured I had a UTI or something. A couple days later it was still there so I went to the clinic.
2.) She looked at me and said my symptoms describe herpes but I don't have any of the bumps so she wasn't sure. She gave me Acclyovir (sorry spelling 😟) and told me to take it because if it it herpes then that's  great, the medicine will work and if it wasn't herpes then there's no side effect to usage anyway.
3.) When I got home I told him I got tested for STDs but I didn't tell him I got the herpes meds because I wanted to be sure for myself. He ended up finding the package the next day anyway so he asked about it himself. I told him that The woman wasn't sure because I have no lesions, and wanted to know for sure before I told him. Your girlfriend might be in the same position- tests take 7 ish days to come back. What's the date on the prescription?
4.) I definitely didn't cheat on my boyfriend- even though I got symptoms over a year and a half into our relationship. I likely gave it to him even though he  never had an outbreak. His immune system is probably suppressing it. Every now and then he asks for one of my meds if he feels a tingle and it goes away.

You're girlfriend is probably embarrassed. She definitely shouldn't have kept it from you but I understand if she was waiting for confirmation from her test to tell you because clinics really do prescribe Aaclyvir (sp again 😣) before you're diagnosed. That said, if she knows she's had it and it's not a new thing THEN that's a big red flag. 

Don't assume she cheated on you. Also no you don't have to stay with her. My boyfriend and I had ups and downs and never once did I consider staying in the relationship just because I have herpes.

Also, tell her to use Valtrex- it works better. It's more expensive but insurance covers it

Also if you take two pills a day (maybe 3 for aaclyvir) it keeps away out breaks and reduces chance of transmission from your gf if you do not have it already "
Maybe you could tell your mom that you appreciate her and her friends praying for you but that you would like things to be more private and don't want her friends to pray over you because it makes you feel uncomfortable - as in you don't want the attention or pity. It's probably not a good idea just yet to tell your mom that you don't believe in god - it will send her in a whirlwind of fear. Your in a tight spot. I feel for you. 
"Exactly. This has nothing to do with the day and age we're living in. It's just human decency. While I may not have to stitch an A to my clothes, I will have to endure all of the backlash and interest that comes with having my sex life dissected by friends and relatives and the people in my parents' neighbourhood. 

That's *not* okay. 

"
"&gt; You can use the argument with your dad that she needs to be able to support herself.

Women un the family are trained to be supported as housewives. I've seen it first hand with the younger cousins. Its bs. If she goes about it the way dad wants she wont need to support herself."
"&gt;I have tried to hard to accommodate everything he wants done.

Thats your problem right there. Stop trying to cater to his every whim and stand up for yourself. Break up and move out. Who knows what he does to the bird when you aren't home. Ever wonder WHY she is terrified of him? Does she act like that with everyone or just him?"
"Your boyfriend is lazy and doesn't care. He should be spending 8 hours a day trying to sort his life out. Applying for jobs, studying something to enable him to get a job, whatever. And it's not difficult to maintain an apartment when you're there full time and don't have kids.  
  
You've not moved in with a boyfriend, you've adopted a a 28-year-old child. You deserve better. "
"I think you only feel ""conflicted"" because they're manipulating you. Anyone with an outside perspective can see through that manipulation and tell you that you need to put your foot down and leave. Not wait for their permission to leave. I'm the same age as you, but moved out at 17 (fairly standard where I lived), and I feel like I did most of my ""cooking"" and growing as an adult after that point. You can only cook so much if you're still in the mixing bowl and not the oven. This metaphor isn't super but I think you see my point."
"Dump him. This is super uncool. You have asked him to stop and he refuses. He's NOT going to stop. He told you he's not going to stop.

Dump. Dump dump dump. "
"It might also be helpful for you, OP, to think a little about how in art a physical object can represent emotional and mental states. You don't have to get everything, but you might make an effort to accept that for her, and for other people, those representations can be readily apparent and emotionally loaded. 

For example, she said the sculptures are separate cups because each one holds a part of herself. So, you can see how if that was her intent, the sculpture needed to be a set, a cohesive whole, of some sort of vessel, as opposed to a book or a tree or whatever.

&gt; cool little cups, and each of them was a different color or shape. some of them were really dainty and others were all gnarly. She talked about the different sides of herself she's come to accept as a whole ""entity"".

Each cup is a different color. Perhaps that suggests a variety of moods? Warm light colors might be sunny, cool light colors might be melancholy, darker colors might be anger or passion, etc. 

It's interesting that she picked a familiar domestic object, a thing you have in your childhood home or your home with your husband. I love that she made a set of something, like a set of dishes you buy all at once, because she's observing parts of herself and attempting to accept that, despite some being pretty and some being gnarly, they form a cohesive whole. Like, her life has beauty in it -- it sounds like you have a great marriage, she's completed college, you're talking kids -- it also has past abuse that has had lasting impacts. Having that in your background can feel dark and shameful. But she's attempting to reconcile with that and own and honor the person she's become (abuse makes that hard).

So I suggest following u/OtherKindofMermaid's advice and show interest in the project and her experiences in class. Ask open-ended questions about the choices she made. How did she decide on the colors? Which pieces did she make first? Did she pick different types of clay? Glazes? How did she conceive of the shapes of the gnarly ones?

Ask her what's next. What was her favorite technique (there are vessels built out of coiled ropes of clay, pots thrown on a pottery wheel, etc.) Does she have ideas for new pieces? Will she continue with the group? If she seems kind of lit up about continuing, you might ask her if, at some point in the future, she'd like a kiln and a studio at home. 

I mean, if you want to go all in."
"Right?! And it's not even like French and Italian are uncommon languages! If you claim to be fluent in, I dunno, Icelandic, you can probably feel pretty safe. But French?!?"
"Boom. Right here.

Almost the exact same situation. Me and my ex were in an LDR for a bit over a year. When we saw each other, he took me out, always had an arm around me, held my had, was proud to be with me. We would dance and go places and I felt wanted and special and desireable. We would sext all the time when we couldn't be together, it was awesome.

Then I moved to his state.

I kept up trying to do the things we both seemed to enjoy. I'd sext him and get ""That sound good"" or ""Can't wait"" where before I'd get a graphic play by play. We never went out because he ""didn't feel like it"". He never touched me anymore unless he wanted sex. 

I tried time and time and time again that to explain that for me, I can't go from zero to I want you. A boring night of TV during which I'm ignored until bedtime is not a turn on. It didn't have to be something special or a lot every time we were together, and it wouldn't even take much. Something as simple as ""I think this movie can wait.... *wink*"" would be enough. 

But god damn I felt like a jerk off sleeve. Put in a drawer until he wanted sex. Gross. "
"The children who have been invited are over 6. You have an infant, that's a big difference.

Just let it go and enjoy a night without the kids."
"&gt;My question is; how do I get her to stop commenting on my looks while also not being an asshole?

My question is; how does anyone *start* commenting on your looks while also not being an asshole? Because she's not managing it.

Just blank it. The old ""Wow, why would you say that?"" line works well. She is being incredibly rude."
"Ugh, your boyfriend sounds like one of those people who's so wrapped up in the idea that he's a good person, a much better than average person, that he's blind to the ways he's a judgmental jerk. If this relationship is going to continue, you have to make it clear to him that he can't treat you in such a sanctimonious fashion."
"Yeah it's really not even about the furniture at this point, the focus should be her bad behaviour. Me and my boyfriend are having a similar discussion right now but not *once* has a nasty name or insult been exchanged. I respect him more than to force him to spend money he's not comfortable spending on stuff that isn't essential. OPs girlfriend is being very controlling and immature and the behaviour won't stop at this."
"She explains in another comment that he uses every surface and doesn't wipe spills as he goes, dumps garbage and dishes into the sink together and uses an excessive amount of dishes while cooking. He likely doesn't put food or cooking supplies away either. But that's just a guess based on his general attitude. 

I don't find an hour hard to believe with someone who cooks like this."
I'd love a friend like Jack 👌🏻
Exactly. He *put* you through something awful. Save yourself.
"There is no way I'd be in the life of someone who would write such an obviously untrue letter to fuck with someone's custody case just because they don't get along. That's a serious lack of character right there. I hope he realizes that his brother and his new wife are pieces of shit who don't deserve support, and that eventually that kind of vitriol and awfulness they displayed towards his sister *will* be directed at him if he stays in their life.

I hope they think about what they've done, while they stand at their wedding alone."
"Actually this is the perfect weekend for her to take all her shit and get a hotel for the weekend, on his dime. Or he'll, just get a new apartment and move out altogether, since he won't be in her way manipulating her out of it. See how he likes not being told what's happening with his life/house/whatever. "
"Sounds like you've already communicated your viewpoint. That is not her ideal body type.

Let her be the gal she wants to be."

"&gt; no one is really at fault here

Except whoever originally abused the kid"
I actually checked to see if I was reading a r/nosleep story rather than r/relationships. This is so bad it reads like a freakin' horror story. 
"Don't get ""revenge"" - she'll likely turn that around into making herself the victim, ""I was only trying to help"", etc. Personally I'd go the very cold / distant route: ""You promised you wouldn't touch anything, instead you changed my entire apartment and left paint everywhere, and threw away personal items of mine. I now know that your promises are worthless, and I expect an apology"". Then basically cut her off until she apologises and makes it right. 

Ultimately there's very little you can practically do beyond limiting your relationship so she understands how wrong her actions were, but most likely she'll never truly apologise and will tell you you're overreacting / not appreciating her efforts. "
"Well, if he brings in 100K per year, but is spending 200K per year, he's a net liability.  

Also, nobody is indispensable.  If he dies tomorrow, wouldn't you try to find someone to come and help you with marketing?  Why not start now?  As a manager, the first thing I did with anyone indispensable is that I dispensed with them.  Seriously.  Reassigned them to something else, made them cross train others on what they were doing, etc.  There is no reason why someone in a critical position shouldn't be training others in case they are incapacitated.

If he is truly the only person on the planet who can do what he does, you might consider getting into another line of work.  Your parents sound very entitled, and I fully expect that he is going to either refuse to do his job, or outright sabotage you to get you to open the purse strings back up.

As a parent, I'm appalled at their disregard for your financial future.  ""Oh, who cares of my son has anything to eat when he retires, I really want these NEW SHOES!""  I mean, seriously?"
"She's not a zombie or fake. She's sad! Moving to a new state really sucks in the best circumstances. She is fresh from a bad relationship. Her new relationship is with some dude who thinks she is ""fake"" for having emotions. She is probably lonely and depressed and confused. I would say that you should be doing a lot more to be emotionally supportive but it doesn't seem as though you even like her. Break up with her. I hope she has a safe support system back in her original state."
"Holy shit this guy sounds mental. You don't need closure. His actions are closure enough and YOU are in charge of how you move on. You can do this. Stay strong, stay busy. He will have to get in touch with you sooner or later. Something is really wrong with this guy and he is obviously going through something. Sort yourself out. In the end you do not deserve this. Start healing yourself now, mourn, grieve and recover. I'm so sorry OP. Nobody deserves this. "
Have some pride and dump the fuck out of her when she finally turns up of course. 
" I'm a woman who has had male roommates. 

I've dated men who have had female roommates. 

I still would not be okay with this. "
"No. He hasn't tried to push a bowling ball through his dick for a day and a half, and then be able to feel them slicing open his belly to take it out. "
"You are going out of your way to imagine excuses for this guy.

&gt;it was pretty bizarre how he wasn't listening to me. I was firm, not playful or coy when I said I didn't like it, but it seems like it went over his head and he must of thought deep down I really did want it?

NOTHING went over his head, **he's 40**, he's not some kid that doesn't know how to date or whats appropriate. He's 40, he knows whats socially acceptable, he's not a clueless virgin, he's done this before. You communicated clearly, he heard you, **he just didn't give enough fucks to listen or respect your no**."
"This woman does not sound smart. Three kids, including a one year old and she's pregnant again with someone else's kid? Yikes. "
"I know someone with HIV who is able to sleep with their partner in the same bed and kiss them without there being as much red tape as your boyfriend has. I know people with cold sores/herpes who are treated with respect and dignity.

You are being treated like a hole and not a partner. Sorry to be crude, but if he is so worried about the transmission, he wouldn't let you near his penis. He obviously knows nothing about what you have or the risks, which I would think he would research first.

He obviously thinks he can treat you badly because he is ignorant of what you have. 

So I would dump him. 

Then I would go to the doctor and figure out what you exactly have, what meds you need to take, and then stick to that regimen. It is not the end of the world to have herpes, but that doesn't mean other people will be okay with you not taking the meds. For your own health and well being, you should follow the medication as ordered."
"Ok, so I'm tempted to cut her a LOT of slack here because of the huge shock she had.

But...

If her go-to solution to a crisis is to fuck whoever is closest, this may not be the ideal person to marry."
"She'll have to get through school and then get a good job-- but once she is financially independent, she can do what she wants with her life and will feel much less pressured by your dad and dad's family. It's really great that you're so supportive of her. Let her know that it's not her fault to ""stir up trouble"" in the family, it's her dad and her aunts' fault for holding such backwards misogynistic views."
"Omg girl, this guy is awful! I have dated a guy like this, it was so bad for my self esteem. I really suggest even if you stay with this guy, consider therapy before this really hurts your self esteem. 

Also, from another woman who games I highly suggest looking for other groups with more women, or at least people who are older. R's behavior isn't uncommon with younger male gamers. Typically when joining a group I ask what the general maturity level is and if there are other women. Bonus points if it's a guild or group led by a woman! "
"call his mother and tell her she needs to make alternate arrangements until your BF gets home, as you have no idea how to handle them and he's just left you high &amp; dry. people who are used to dealing with dogs don't really think anything of it, it just comes naturally, but to dump this on you when he knows you're not comfortable with it is really obnoxious."
"It's a goddamn bird. He's allowed to not like it, but he's a full-grown adult, not a 5 year old. Where does he get off on tormenting it? 

This speaks volumes about him being a cruel, unempathetic individual, honestly. I wonder how he treats people he doesn't like, or service staff, etc."
"There's something called two-carding your spouse. You hand him/her two business cards, one for a divorce lawyer and another for a therapist. Spouse chooses his or her own adventure. You're at that point.

"Honestly, I think mentioning it before he sees it is making a bigger deal out of it than it needs to be. If he sees it and asks, just say your parents got it for you for your work. I would casually add something like ""Wasn't that generous of them?"" and then change the subject.

Your parents aren't paying your rent or sending you on an international vacation. They gave you a tool for your job. It was kind of them. You are a lucky person to have parents who can help you. Don't be ashamed of it. It doesn't reflect poorly on you and anyone who thinks it does is too caught up in their own ego to be happy for you."
"I can't see this guy giving you what you want long term; that is, a happy stable home with two loving parents. 

I had an abortion, last year. If you want to PM me to talk about it more in depth I really would love to give you a perspective from someone who has gone through it. Long story short for me, was a hard decision to make (I was 11 weeks when I had the operation) as I had bonded with the baby too. After it happened I felt like I was never gunna be okay. But that was my hormones going nuts... it's been a year and I look back and I'm really sort of tragically grateful that I did what I did because life would be so hard now if I hadn't made that choice. 

Love and hugs your way. Like I said, feel free to PM me if you want to talk about the abortion and the aftermath etc in more depth... good luck."
"This is exactly how my marriage ended. Discussion about co-worker and ex swore up and down that I had nothing to worry about.

Stayed out one night until morning, after checking in and ignoring my pleas to come home.

Totally stayed at her house that night.

Fin.

I hope your story isn't so cut and dried as mine was. Good luck man."
Your boyfriend didn't just say it. You asked for specifics. Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to
"&gt; I got a very fun call from my MIL asking why I won't give her any more grandchildren

""Because the unpleasant experience of getting gutted like a fish is enough to scar me for life. Stay out of my uterus.""

Excuse my language.

Maybe you should consider seeing a therapist. Not to convince you to have more children, but it's probably good to get help to feel more at ease about past trauma."
"&gt; Can I confront her, even though I snooped?

You can, but why bother?
What do you hope to achieve by confronting her? That she'll make a promise and then break it again? That she will stop emotionally cheating on you with this guy?
Will you ever truly trust this woman? Is that the kind of relationship you want?


Tell her you are breaking up with her, and tell her you are doing it because she is still in contact with that guy.
You gave her a choice, and she chose. Too bad she didn't choose you."
I hoped that 90% was savings for her academy. But I can't be certain. I'll have her tell me.
"Several years ago I had an altercation with my stepmother. I really thought we had moved past it. (Conversations happened that I thought meant something.)

"If you knew from your app that she wasn't coming over, how was she able to convince you that she had been? That's just giving a liar an out they shouldn't have had. Regardless, I would count the Facebook block as a blessing and very bluntly tell your mom the truth of the matter. I hope your pup is doing okay, and I hope you're able to still talk to your niece even if your sister is being a POS. "
"I think an email stating that you will not be attending is fine. Others will have probably responded about the JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Engage). They cannot win if you do not play, but if it's the first time you've set a hard boundary with your sis I expect a long period of drama, flying monkeys (sent on your sis behalf) and tears/tantrums. ANd you know why?&gt; bc it will give your sister the attention she craves.

So, my advice is to learn how to say ""I'm not going to discuss that, I've already said ~~know~~ no, and my email explained why I said no. How is cousin XYZ?"" 

It'll be hard but your life will become 110% better once your boundaries are in place."

"If OP talks to Roger instead of HR, she runs the risk of him finding a trumped up reason to fire her, and the company would let him, since they'd be unaware of what's going on. If she talks to HR first, the company will be aware that any attempt on Roger's part to fire her is retaliation after sexual harassment, and they won't allow it to happen (because holy lawsuit payday, batman). Going to HR will allow OP to protect herself. Given that OP's employment and housing are simultaneously at stake here, I don't think she can afford to not go this route. (Also, there's the chocolate sauce on this shit sundae, that this guy has keys to her apartment.)"
"Yes. And adult men have friendships. And they walked there and back. 

As for your sister: ""I appreciate how hard you are trying, but you can't force these things. Why don't YOU try to bond with you little brother? Why don't you try to learn more about the books he reads?""

As for your mom: ""This isn't a big deal and the school is being ridiculous. Hold your head high. Brother may be a little more shy, but you did alright raising all on your own. Maybe you could try and find clubs or activities that would appeal to brother."""
"Go to the police. Two of you with the same testimony (especially if you have texts as proof) is enough for the cops to pay him a visit and while they may not actually charge him with anything (super hard to do) it'll likely stop that initially. Block that chick that is threatening you/report her to the police as well. Gonna need far more details than you're giving I guess.

Also probably break up with your boyfriend - someone who instantly spreads your nudes is not trustworthy/reliable, even if you're a supermodel. Speaks of a lack of respect and privacy for you and your life. If you want to stay together with him and go forward, probably talk to him about being more responsible and actually being an adult."
"What she is doing is not OK.
You are having these feelings of insecurity because she is far away from you in a cabin with her ex. It is very inappropriate, and she should have called it off. I certainly wouldn't stay in such a new relationship with someone who makes those kind of judgement calls.

"As a girl who regularly goes to the gym, I don't think she thinks you're a creep. I think she may just be avoiding eye contact with you to avoid giving you the impression that she's changed her mind about the date thing. Don't say anything, it'll likely blow over in a couple of weeks and you'll go back to your normal eye contact or small talk."
"Hey man, sorry to hear about the bad luck.

Just a thought aside from the good ideas these people have already put forward - I just checked your post history out of curiosity, and it's liiiiiike 90% gaming. Don't get me wrong, I'm female and I have been majorly addicted to LoL for long periods, I love gaming, and my boyfriend games a fair bit too (currently next to me playing Rocket League.) However, do you have many other hobbies/interests to talk about..? It's pretty hard to hold an engaging, fun conversation with someone when they don't have much to say about their lives (I know I had quite little to say when all I did was work then game all night), especially on the first date when the conversation starts off more surface. 

Also, if it becomes apparent that you spend a lot of time on that, many women may be a bit put off. Like I said, I enjoy gaming, but my ex for example was COMPLETELY addicted and it ended up ruining us. I had to game more to spend time with him/survive in the relationship, and he didn't talk about very much except games. I don't want to assume you're addicted, you may be perfectly fine, but it's just a suggestion for self-reflection. My current boyfriend and I game a fair bit together, but nothing revolves around it at all and we go out on dates and chat and play board games/cook/watch series/go for walks or to the gym together too. Everything in balance - I used to want to ditch the gym because it cut into my LoL time.

If you're thinking about games a significant amount outside of the time you spend playing them, might be time to make some changes."

And then you complain when someone else doesn't match your (rather peculiar) standards of discourse around gender?

"No, there's nothing you can do. She's had it, no coming back from that. Yes, it's really over. What the other guy is or will be to her doesn't concern you or change anything. He might be a rebound, he might be her future husband, either way you're still the ex. He may be gone tomorrow, there's still going to be other dudes waiting in line. You cope by cutting contact and concentrating on your life and therapy. 

To be honest, this whole post makes it sound like you only really want her because you can't have her anymore, and you didn't expect that day would come, which has shocked you to your core. Out of curiosity, whose idea was the open relationship thing? Not that it matters now.. "
"If his name isn't on the title than, yes, he was paying rent.  He has zero claim on anything."
"Really want to reiterate this: that was a super shitty and unprofessional thing for your therapist to do. Like... seriously. Fuck that person. 

You have a kid who you've raised fantastically, treated brilliantly and look after. Regardless of whether you love him or not, you're a great effing parent. CPS are not there to measure how much a parent loves their child. They're there to check how they treat them. 
 
But finding a therapist who's not a jackshitting asshole is still a good idea. 

And I super respect you OP. Raising a child you didn't want and raising them WELL takes guts and strength and speaks very highly of your character. You're a better person than most. "
"Oh and: 

&gt; remember she acted like a hotshot because she finished high school and no one else in our family has before.

I sincerely doubt she acted like the hot shot. In many communities like the one you described, the people who get an education and better themselves are the ones who are treated poorly, not the other way around. Crabs in a bucket mentality. 

And if she did act like a hotshot, good for her. She had a shit example of a mom and dad, and this area's characters clearly love their drugs and such. She would've deserved to gloat a little. "
Maybe I missed the question... but it appears you are doing you which is great. You're an adult and should develop your own persona. It is your parent's problem if they cannot come to terms with that. 
"You are not overreacting.

Best case scenario: He told you the truth. Which also means that your love and affection isn't enough for him.

Worst case scenario: He thought he could cheat on you while overseas and you'll never know.

Both cases would be a deal breaker for me. But ultimately it's up to you to decide what you are doing with it."
I'm sorry but do not invite this woman to hang out with your fiancee and you. That just screams bad idea.
"As others have mentioned, I'd work on this notion of feeling ""ditched"" etc. It'll be cancerous. Moving in together means you'll be together.. a lot. Trust me, movie night will happen day after day, year after year- you'll want to get into your own hobbies and let him do his when you both need to. You have to be able to have fun and function independently. Yeah you guys agreed to watch something later- but spontaneity is going to happen at times. My ex and I lived together and if I ever did anything without her she felt left out and always argued with me and got upset- but then never wanted to do anything. It was the catch 22 from hell. 

You do need to express how you feel when it comes to his argument style though- in a non argumentative way. I can't stress that last part enough, don't just relive the argument and argue about the argument. In a calm and composed way state that you don't enjoy being mocked when you guys argue. Arguments will happen but some rules of war should be respected. "
"
&gt;In the mean time, keep a close eye on items like identification and watch access to your bank account and debit card if you have one. Some controlling parents will go to great lengths to keep that control, as you're obviously starting to experience. 


I second this. She might start to freak out the more independent you get. If you don't already have an account separate from her, get one to put your new jobs paychecks into. You'd be surprised what she might be capable of in order to remain in control.

"
My relationship with myself is going strong. 25 years and counting! 
"&gt; It's highly unlikely they took the time to stop and add a condom but couldn't have stopped because they got carried away. 

That is a really good point. If they stopped long enough to put on a condom, they also stopped long enough for him to have realized what the hell he was doing and to end the whole encounter. Either he's lying about getting carried away and this was much more intentional than he let on, or he's lying about using the condom and chose to endanger the OP's health, on top of everything else."
"&gt;fan-edits where they play up a romance between two characters, especially when none exists.

Yeah I think it's called ""shipping."" "
"Your boyfriend was more upset at the fact that they shit-talked about him than they do about you. He surrounds himself by these two girls who obviously stroke his ego and put you down.

Your bf is terrible. I won't tell you to ""leave him"", but if you have any self-respect you will not put up with someone who allows others to disrespect you so badly in front of them."
"He basically forced an open relationship on you, but was also apprehensive when you wanted it to go both ways???

Normally when people get into an open relationship, there is a lot of discussion on both ends, and the decision is made TOGETHER. It's not an ultimatum.

It doesn't sound like he cares too much about you or your feelings. You can do better."
"I call them white in the sense that they're not hurtful to anyone necessarily, but you're right - claiming to know a language you absolutely don't is pretty decently sized."
"&gt; I wouldn't be finished with my degree by the time he comes back. 

So? You'll never finish it at all if you don't start it. "
It's not worse.  A single woman also has people who care about her and don't want her getting assaulted and harassed.  It always sucks. Presence of a SO does not make it worse (as a woman who's endured that kind of harassment both with and without partners there).  I'm still the one getting their ass spanked regardless.
"Can you arrange to be out of the house a few evenings a week so that there is a fixed routine of him caring for her? Join a yoga class or something else that can be relaxing and mood-enhancing. Sneak off for a cup of coffee by yourself afterwards if you have to. You could also use this time to go to a therapist (you can tell your husband it's for working on your sex drive.)

Ramp it up gradually so that you can get him doing the childcare for two weeknights and a weekend morning. 

To be clear, your husband is awful and ""his work his harder and I have it easy because I am a receptionist"" is fucking bullshit. And you might eventually have to divorce him. But it sounds like right now you just need some space in your head.  Shoot for that first and then consider your options. "
"I also wonder if some of his social anxiety stems from this treatment from his family. He seems to be thriving with someone who is his cheerleader and supporter in life and encouraging him to pursue his dreams, and not trying to stagnate his growth and relationships with people outside the family."
"You have every right to an expectation of having your own life. 

You need to firmly respond that while you love your brother and, like everyone, you are sorry for his supremely poor choices, you are simply not at the stage of your life where you can live with anyone. 

If your father is offering help with rent, can he help your brother directly by helping him find and afford a place to live on his own? Explain that it has nothing to do with not wanting to help him, and everything to do with needing to be on your own during the beginning stages of ""leaving the nest"" and that this is just as critical a time for you as it is for him. 

It's not a selfish response. Your brother made his choices and will now deal with the consequences of his actions, including all the drama that comes with it during the divorce and coming birth of his child out of wedlock. 

You don't want to be anywhere near that, and if he moves in with you it will become a part of your life at a time when your focus absolutely needs to be on yourself and your first steps into the world. 

I know this whole thing sucks and I'm sorry that you're being targeted as a potential solution to his mistakes. "
"Yup, it's crabs in a bucket. 

I bet she did something ""snobby"" like invite them to graduation, or use a three-syllable word. Or choose to study instead of drinking away her teens. "
"Your brother brought it on himself. He chose to throw two tantrums then tried to get your friends' numbers. He's immature and frankly a creep. Doesn't take a genius to see why he wanted in on a hut tub full of girls around his age, and the phone thing makes it look even sketchier."
"Well this will teach you to come to the ""everyone's having an affair, dump everyone"" sub lmao, although this is particularly bad. 

I think a lot of people half-kiss back when surprise kissed by a non-partner. It takes a second for that ""this is a bad idea"" voice to kick in. After *that*, you're in f***up territory, so I think he's fine. A 24 hr grace period to figure out how to tell you is also totally reasonable. And HE showed you the text. ""You don't know what happened"" isn't a reason to dump him, and is literally always true in any situation like this. On top of all this, a drunken 2-second surprise kiss is very low on the totem pole. He's your husband and you know him better than these trolls. Friggin nuts, ignore them...

Her husband is lumping you in with the other two because he has probably done that the whole time. He has spent a decade being the odd guy out, which builds resentment. Does he drink as much as you guys? Maybe he thinks you're a bad influence in that or another way. Add to that whatever version of things 28F told him, and there you are. Not much you can do about it—you're not going to change their intra-relationship decision. And if you do it might finish them off. "
"As a female with a lot of male friends, this resonates with me as well.  After making it clear that I'm not romantically interested, the guy hangs around ignoring what I exactly told him, skewing my words in his head.  Then it ends up with that ""friend"" I trusted and bonded with violating my trust and boundaries.  It sucks.  Unfortunately I often end up being blamed for ""leading him on"".  

Same thing here with OP, OP's friend was very clear from the getgo, but she is not listening to what he's saying."

"No, **children still have the right to property**. Sorry, just because he isn't 18 doesn't mean he doesn't own something and she can just ""make a parental decision"" and steal. And if he wanted to make a big deal, he could clearly ask the police to have her turn his property over or get charged with theft. Most likely, the police will call it a domestic matter, but a cop will probably tell her to stop being stupid and return his property.

So yeah, his dad should intervene and he should ask to live with his dad and just... move on from her being in his life."
"You need to have a good family law attorney and apply for child support, medical coverage, etc.  The foul reality of child support is that the person that applies first gets the biggest piece of the pie.

Go to the website survivinginfidelitydotcom for support and advice.  They even have a thread in one of their forums for women in your exact circumstances."
"Oh this makes my blood boil.

I'm a foster parent and I've had my foster daughter for over 5 years now, she was just shy of 2 when I got her.

My friends/family ADORE her and have from day 1 and most of my weekends are spent on birthday parties and play dates and my sibling in laws are always wanting her to come over and play with my nieces and nephews. Hell, I remember getting annoyed at a friend because she bought my kid an iPad for her 5th birthday without discussing it with me first. But at least there was the love there.

I remember when the first Frozen movie came out, she was 3 and my sister and my cousin came with me and my SO to see it because they wanted to spent time with her- the kiddo that had only been in our family for a year got a fucking cavalcade to the movies. 

You need better friends OP, these guys are assholes."
"DONT HAVE KIDS BECAUSE SOMEONE IS A NAG.

Please don't have kids unless you are thrilled and delighted to have them in your life.

If you're this serious, book a vasectomy.  Show her you are dead serious and that you will never have kids.

Screw wedding deposits and who is you can have dinner with this weekend, the worst case scenario is kids you don't want, please don't do this to her or the kid."
"You absolutely don't need to cut down your hours to provide her with 15-30 minutes of your time in an evening.  

I don't know how you eat but maybe you're just tired?  A lot of things can cause you to be more tired than you should be - eating a lot of processed foods, eating foods you're allergic to, not getting enough sleep, too much time in front of lit screens, not enough exercise...if I were you I'd try to figure out why you don't have the energy to help your wife with household duties. "
"No. It's friends.
It's not family, it's not permanent.
The couple are (and should be) the primary caregivers and they did this WAY too fast."
"You know that they can afford to move out; they've told you that they just don't want to. If your partner wants to help, there are a million ways to help that don't involve them becoming your non-paying tenants forever. "
Cut off all contact with him and anyone else around him. He fucked up and now he's facing the consequences of his actions. Don't lie in court. You deserve better than this abusive asshole. Get help for yourself and move on from your abuser.
Seriously. When will people 1) stop asking very unnecessary questions that have extremely painful possible answers and 2) stop answering those questions honestly as if they suddenly forgot how to lie to avoid hurting someone's feelings.
"Something tells me this isn't the first time at all you have checked out of your responsibilities as a husband/father/both for video games. There is nothing wrong with gaming, but at appropriate times and NOT when you have another responsibility. Sounds like you can't figure out when those times are.

Sell all your games and consoles/equipment. Clearly you choose games over your son and that needs to stop. Taking action yourself to remove the problem, and it's clear games are a problem FOR YOU, might show your wife you have a genuine interest in actually being a father."
"If they really are all so regretful they can chip in for the kid's education now. Lotta talk, no action still. He's only twelve years old, don't act like there's no time, instead of 36 people taking a cruise next year, donate to his college fund. If no one wants to chip in, the cousin's girlfriend is right, no one actually wants to put their money where their mouth is."
"I don't think a lot of commenters appreciate just how fraught and political speaking English vs. French is in Quebec.  Imagine those videos you see sometimes of a redneck in the US ranting at some poor woman speaking Spanish in the checkout line of Walmart, except both sides do it to each other and politicians can make their whole careers by being for or against one language or another.

None of that excuses Marc being extremely rude to you at the party.  If he was the host, then it was even more unconscionable.  You were mocked, berated, and belittled publicly, and I'm not surprised you walked away with a bad taste in your mouth.  I hope you just neglected to mention the part where your boyfriend angrily defended you against Marc's attacks and poor manners, because it is literally his job to defend you against hostility from his own friends and family.  To not do so is cowardly and warrants a serious conversation between the two of you about the expectations and future of your relationship, in my opinion."
"An ad your fiance an email saying that you are being forcefully drugged and held against your will, and that you want her to call the police. This way, when you DO call the police, which your mother I am sure will escalate the situation to force, then your fiancee will have evidence. Copy your siblings on this email. Do you really think that your fiancee will show up and your mother will gladly just hand you over?"
During a really heated argument I showed my parents the texts and specifically the ones where he's telling the girl he loves her. It did nothing. 
"Any kind of flirting with a different woman isn't fair to your wife. I know a work wife-work husband pair at my work and it seems a bit odd when they constantly hang around each other and get lunch/dinner together so often. They are both married to other people and have kids. Work is work, anything beyond that can definitely be considered weird."
"Yeah. I'm amazed CPS even took the call - parents don't love their kids on a regular basis, it's surprisingly normal. OP needs to work through her stuff in therapy, not try to give away her kid."
"Holy shit, she's trying to sabotage you to avoid relinquishing control. This is pretty fucking serious."
"Your dad is an adult. Your uncle is an adult. I'm sure they are capable of figuring something out. You should not put yourself in harms way to make someone else feel better. 

Your dad sounds like a terrible father and you owe him nothing for being related. "
"Worth considering -- do you feel happy with your own level of physical fitness, and do you feel desired by your partner? "
"Also if he loses his job, the courts will have a field day. 

OP it's hard, but you gotta keep your head in the game. 

Have you put your cousin on blast to your family yet?"
You feel bad for a girl you don't know? Stand up for your fiancée! That is so disrespectful and I would be expressing the same sentiment. You need to step up !
[removed]
Some parents are not meant to be with each other. That has nothing to do with you. You should sit them down and talk to them about this. They both deserve to be happy but that doesn't necessarily mean happy together.
"Look, your boyfriend is completely disrespecting you on this. He isn't even willing to discuss it with you. After multiple conversations, he isn't changing. I know that you don't want to break up with him, but at some point, how will you be able to build a financial future who isn't even willing to put their financial weight in the relationship currently? The bottom line is that you don't trust this guy when it comes to finances and disagreements on money/finances are one of the biggest reasons adult relationships end (along with sex). "
"You take people at their word. If someone says they're fluent in French, they're saying ""my comfort level is fluent French and I am willing to converse in it"". Fluency has a meaning. She should have been able to get the gist of what you said, or been classy enough to respond with a joke about being rusty. She embarrassed herself. 



You did nothing wrong. "
"&gt; Which is why he doesn't want me to go because he wants me to be here when he gets back

This is really selfish of him.  He choose a career where he will routinely leave you for long periods of time but he refuses to give you the same opportunity so that you can advance your career?   Go to school.  Be a nurse."
"Not to mention his family, good lord."
he's valuing their attention more than the health of your relationship.
"Well... it's her pregnancy, she's an adult, and she should be the one who gets to decide who knows about it. Some people tell early because if they do have a miscarriage they want people to support them through that too. 

Why does your dad care so much? "
"Probably varies by location, culture, possibly even socioeconomic class. I grew up in a fairly ritzy, city like part of my state and I would say that 17-19 seemed to be the average age to lose it while my boyfriend is from a poorer, rural area and it was definitely 13-15 average there. "
"There's way more that's been leading up to this, I'm sure. The paternity test was just the straw that broke the camels back. You really thought she wouldn't be upset? You made your wife get a paternity test because your ex stepmom cheated on your dad 14 years ago. I'm not following the logic train there. "
"Girlfriend is acting like a normal adult who expects to be trusted and supported by her significant other.  She is not responsible for catering to all of your emotional whims and how you feel. Stop wallowing in immaturity, anxiety, and jealousy."
"You have to say something to get your husband to realize just how bad this is for your marriage. She is part of the problem, but the bigger part for you is that your husband needs to consider your feelings and present a united front with you. If he doesn't get on board things are going to go badly for you. "
"Yes, it is a dealbreaker. It's *THE* dealbreaker, the only one on which there is absolutely zero chance of compromise.

&gt;I'm worried that I'll stop him from having a truly fulfilled life if what he really does want is to have kids at some point. 

That is exactly what will happen.    

You won't *possibly* hit this roadblock.  You will hit it.  It is there, looming.  He would have to fully,  100%, sacrifice fatherhood for you - or you have to fully embrace becoming a mother."
"Love this idea.

Alternately, donate to charity in her name, and use that donation as your bid. If she refuses, she looks like a prat, and you can feign insult."
"Yeah, if he's looking for a way to bring it up, maybe he could say something like, ""I noticed you asked your mom what she thought about you getting more work done. Are you thinking of getting more, or were those questions idle curiosity?"" That way it's clear he's bringing it up because of something she said and not because of how she looks. "
"Also, Matthew 6:34:

&gt; Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
I don't think so. Adam has never really had a problem with girls. I don't know what happened to him mid last year. He one day lost all interest in one time hook ups with girls. He then met Jelena and the rest was history.

"Baby or not, if he's living with you, you're going to also be fending off debt chasers. At some point, those loans will need to be paid off. It sounds like he'd be a bad roommate. Best would be to not let him move in and not combine anything financially. He'll have to carry himself then, while you take care of you and the baby. You've taken care of your siblings all that time, you continued the pattern with him. Now the child is going to be a priority and you can't parent him anymore. It's going to be ugly, unless he grows up.

If you're the main earner, it might be cheaper to let him take care of the child full time while living with you. Crunch some numbers and do make sure that he's competent at babycare. 

What situation will give you the least headache? In a few months, you're going to be swollen, sleep deprived, hormonal and back to work to keep your shit together. If you think he's a going to be a support, see if you can work things out. If you think he's going to be a burden, end the relationship. And while you might be able to make it financially, do arrange for child support, as that's something for your child. He'll still be responsible for making the baby. He'll need a job then."
"It is absolutely 100% your decision and right to get more tats.

But: that decision comes with consequences.


It is absolutely 100% his decision and right if he chooses to not to remain married to someone who gets more tats. (For example, it may destroy his attraction to you.)

Choose carefully."
"Yeah, my brothers the sane one. I might even consider him the person I trust the most out of everyone I know. He tried to warn me about my ex boyfriend while we were dating. While everyone else in my family was fawning over him, my brother felt that something was off about him.

Hopefully he can talk some sense into her."
"Wipe your stuff off his drive. Seriously. Like, now. This is so fucking creepy. A huge part of me, this is from personal experience so maybe I'm projecting a little, sees copying all your files ever as a controlling, manipulative action. Maybe it's not that at all, but that's a lot of ammo for someone to have on someone else. He has absolutely no logical reason to have any of those files. When you ask him why he has them, what possible reason could he give you that would make sense? ""I was making a second copy for you in case something happened to your drive""? Yeah, no. 

Reading them to begin with is a huge invasion of privacy. But *copying* them? That's indicates that he's thought about the possible need to use these files in some way or another in the future. Fuck. That. 

If nothing else, don't let him have those files or have access to them any longer. If it were me, this would be a deal breaker, no questions asked. I'd be gone by the end of the week. "
"""Hey, don't effing grab me again without my consent. I was NOT into the wrestling the other day and I still have some injuries from it. Please do not ever do that again."""
It sounds like in addition to depression she may have some other mental health issues.  Is she on any medications?  I have experience with a person that sounds similar to your wife and it's a rollercoaster of emotion all the time.  Some days great and others really really shitty.  I'm sorry you're dealing with this.
"&gt; i've asked her about the lubrication issue,

And

&gt; i even had to buy lubricant because half the time she is not self-lubricating

Sorry, OP, but your post also says *you* had to buy the lube. Between that and asking her about it outright (versus just asking her how she's feeling), you do seem kind of weirdly fixated on it.

"
Why the fuck did your husband go to the dinner without you? Way to show his family and brother that they can walk all over you with no consequence. 
"&gt; it's not worth anything if she won't forgive me

This is so me, me, me. It's worth it because it's better for your son. It doesn't have to be worth it because it's better for you. "
"You are probably torturing yourself as to why. 

First of all, of course you are going to be devastated for a while. So take time to eat pints of ice cream while watching romcoms and sobbing in your pjs. Write letters that you don't send. Hit the gym. Take a road trip somewhere awesome. Take up a hobby, or take classes. Adopt a puppy/kitten/bird/tortoise/tarantula/bearded dragon/pygmy goat/silkie chicken. Cry into its fur/feathers/scales on a regular basis. Write a shitty, vengeful, delicious romance novel. Have some senseless affairs (use protection though!) Take up the tuba. If after about 3 - 6 months your feelings are not abating, see a counselor, or see a counselor anyway so that they can help with the feelingsdump. 

I can think of two possible reasons. The first is that maybe he had an affair. If so, then he is attempting to be honorable. If this is true, then let him go. You deserve to go through rich and poor, sickness and health with someone you can trust 100%. 

The other, more likely possibility is that he likes you a lot, maybe even loves you, but his gut was telling him that he couldn't do this. There is nothing wrong with you, your family is great, but for some stupid reason he was increasingly dreading the prospect of being married. He tried to suppress it because there was nothing wrong with you or the relationship and he didn't want to hurt you if there was nothing wrong, but finally the date got close enough that he realized that he needed to end it now or feel sad and trapped. 

This happens. Sometimes, even though you are fine, it's just not right for him. In that case, the only honorable thing was for him to end it. 

This is not a referendum on your value as a human being or partner. Sometimes people have to back out. Trust me it would have hurt worse if this had happened five years down the road with a mortgage and a kid or two in tow. "
"this is encouraging, thank you :)"
"Well her best friend is doing the abusing. I do agree that if it was a man it'd be more shocking or disturbing to most (which isn't right), and I do think maybe she would be more willing to say something or cut that person out."

THEN tell her how pretty her eyes are. Or maybe her legs aren't perfectly hairless (you know she's working at that, right?) don't be like ""EW WHAT IS WITH YOUR LEGS?!"" Or if you go to see her when she's sick, greet her with ""hey, beautiful."" At her age she probably worries that you might only think she's pretty if she looks ""perfect"" all the time; prove to her that's not the case. "
"It was definitely inappropriate, but I would say that if it only happened the once, and that was the extent of the exchange, you are in the clear and don't need to bring it up. If he's behaved indecently toward you or made you feel uncomfortable beyond that, though, then I'd say tell your husband. It seems to me that this particular incident was a bit too trivial, and maybe might come off as a ""you just want to drive a wedge between me and my friend"" thing"

"While I understand completely the need to defend yourself, this is his family. In situations where the SO has a problem with their partners family, it's almost always recommended that it's the partner that must corrall their family. 

He doesn't want to have anything to do with them, which means he probably doesn't want you to leave a letter like that and would likely have an issue with you doing so, which is probably why you bring it up here first instead of just asking him. It's his family and he's made his preference clear to move on from them. Don't drag your family back into it by giving them a start of another fight."
"&gt;I had this feeling too, so I asked and she told me that she wanted to **thank** the other girl for ruining our relationship. 

That makes it even worse, she's not mature enough to be in an adult relationship... "
"Definitely a weird and potentially uncomfortable situation for you. Um, my advice is: do your homework because I didn't freshman year and it made applying to college a nightmare. And just wait it out, she won't be your teacher for the rest of high school. "
Don't date drug addicts with BPD. It should make pretty much every aspect of your life better. 
"This is the basic concept, but let me assure you from my own experience that it won't end here. OP will likely deal with months of this. It's going to be a long road so buckle in, OP. "
"The concern is that people who talk about cheating as ""One thing led to another"" or ""It just happened!"" are making excuses to downplay the event in their own minds and in their retelling.

It's harder to think of it as: I let her unbutton my pants, I let her unzip my pants, I let her pull down my boxers, I let her touch me.. etc.

There will a dozen chances along the way to stop things. And then he had plenty of chances to come clean about it afterwards. 

People who minimize and hide their behaviour seem to be the ones who do it again. Because while they take blame, they still talk as if it was out of their control."
I think you and your brother should come up with a secret handshake and thereby become different *but cooler*.
"&gt;She also had to bite him hard enough to leave a mark early on in their relationship because he'd put his finger up his ass and was trying to force it into her mouth.

Um, WHAT THE FUCK???"
"Read your update. 

Her safety is none of your concern anymore mate. You've texted, shes been online, shes not responded. 

Don't go to his house. Just pack your stuff. Really.

Best you can hope for now is to get out the situation with your head held high, pride intact and that you conducted yourself well and that she did not (regardless of whether she cheated). "

"He had a chance to achieve his dream, it failed. It's long past time for him to contribute financially and you're totally within your right to be frustrated.

And if he pushes back, ask him when is enough with this business if not now?"
"Yeah. Those are all far too many red signs. Honestly, if she cannot explain herself, it may be time to figure out your options. "
"If your mom and brother know precise details of how your apartment's lease breaking policy works then you're definitely getting drawn into too much discussion about this with them. Your response to these topics should be something like.

&gt; 1. ""Sorry, brother moving in won't work for me.""

&gt; 2. ""He should try [alternative thing]"" or change the subject

Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) your position since you'll be opening yourself up to further discussion. It just doesn't work for you.

This will feel weird and robotic to do in conversation, but just be repetitive about it, and eventually they'll get tired of having the same fruitless discussion with you."
I agree. How is it fair to this person to pawn Angie off on her? OP did this person a favor. 
"He sounds like my ex. It was a nightmare. I got so tired of being sexually harassed and groped constantly, being talked to like i was in a porn during non sexual activities. If i tried to say no, he'd mope around like i had wounded him deeply. Times when i couldn't have sex for legitimate medical reasons (childbirth), I had to do oral or anal. It was awful. And I love sex. I'm a high libido person - my current bf and i go probably 4-6 times a week. But I grew to dread my ex's touch. I felt so used."
"Hi, 

I deleted most of the bad PMs I've gotten so I wouldn't have to look at them, but I screencapped the most recent two before I deleted them. 

Who do I send them to? I got a message from who I assume is the mod team asking for a list of usernames, but I can't reply and there's no name (maybe because I'm on a mobile app?)"

"Well, before you even *consider* marriage, it's wise to get used to talking about serious things face to face. "
"I am going to have to disagree 100% that everyone settles for their partner. I would be devastated if my husband felt that way about me, and I certainly do not feel that way about him. I'm honestly really sad for your wife.

"When you marry him, you will replace his Mom as the women in his life he is mean to"
"Congratulations, you're the other woman. At least you only wasted 2 months.

Oh, and he really needs a better cover story. He hasn't dated because he doesn't want to break it to his ex that he moved into his house to save her from horrible living conditions? Now I've heard everything. Even if all of this nonsense *were* true (it's not), would you want to date someone that hides your relationship to protect his ex's feelings?

Not to mention the part where he springs that ""falling for you"" crap on you right after telling you this story. She's about to leave, better tell her what she wants to hear so she'll stick around! That's one of the chapters in the How to Keep Your Side Piece From Getting Fed Up handbook."
He should also be aware that he is dating a dangerous pile of crazy. 
"Lifting is a legit athletic path to take even though it doesn't entail running around or being on a team. Your brothers and cousins are being jerks and are probably jealous that you're smart AND in good physical shape, especially considering your limitations, and don't need to fall back on playing sports as your only point of pride about yourself."
"I would draw a harder line and just not have him around your daughter at all. He is a real risk, and a risk that not everyone recognizes. This also means that you can't leave your daughter with anyone who might bring her around him. 

My FIL had a similar history. Once we had a daughter we broke contact. We were attacked by other family members, but held firm. He did end up molesting a granddaughter. My husband had warned his brother, and then his other family members, about this child specifically because he was worried about how old this girl was getting. FIL had never been convicted so nothing legal could be done. The rest of the family thought the prior incidents weren't relevant because FIL didn't molest his own daughters so granddaughters must be safe too, because the victims were ""old enough to know better"" so weren't really victims, because he loved his grandkids so much. My husband told his brother to protect his daughter literally a few weeks, not even months, before my FIL was arrested for molesting the girl. Don't let that be you.

I'd recommend reading Protecting the Gift, and other resources on preventing abuse, like the website Stop It Now. Protect your little girl. Please.

Edit: My FIL's other known victims were older than fourteen, mostly late teens from the rumors I heard. He was never charged for any of those. My niece was **ten**. Predators are predators."
"I'm really not seeing a problem with (b) there.

Have you started seeing a lawyer about divorce yet? 

Can either afford to buy out the other for the house you are in? (selling now you'll lose a lot)

Somehow someone is going to have to pay someone else 1/2 of her parents' house. Dont let that be you. You may love them but you can no longer afford to subsidize them. 



Meanwhile, as you say, you keep busy and keep out a lot."
"&gt;If I wanted to move into a bigger apartment in the same complex I would have to pay to upgrade/break my lease, and a huge lease breaking fee if I moved out of the complex all together.

There is your excuse. You can't afford it monetarily and you don't want your rental history starting out with you breaking a lease.  It will make it much harder for you to find a place in the future.  Sorry Mom, I have to think about my own well-being.

Don't set yourself on fire to keep another person warm.  He will never pay you back, and no amount of money will recover the hit on your history as an unreliable renter.  Your brother should be looking for a roommate, not a hand-out."
"u/leviOsa934

So while I agree that your FIL's comments were 'upsetting', I also think you handled this waaaaaaaaaaay wrong. Yes - FIL in law is reacting to changing times with obstinacy, yes your husband made a dumb argument, but girl you could have said so many things different and more tactfully. 


From what your post said, it *did* seem like you were baiting him and waiting to tell him off. Let's be honest, moral superiority arguments produce a slight high. It's easy to look at social issues as ""right vs wrong"". To me, it didn't really sound like FIL made a comment one way or another about transgendered people. In fact, it read to me no differently than your joke about ""under the hood"".


So while you can't control what FIL says, maybe having a response like this would be more effective in the future:

&gt;FIL:  ""Oh, so they're just going to start out transgendered""

&gt;You: *Internal pause, adjust, don't lose cool*, ""Actually, [name] has been common for both genders for quite some time. I think it's a cute name. And honestly, if it was my child, I would love them no matter who they grew up to be. I find it really sad how trans people get so much hate, I always try and put my prejudices aside and realize no person is that different from another"".

OR 

&gt;FIL:""But wouldn't you want your boy to be a MAN, and a girl to be a WOMAN?""


&gt;You: ""No, I will be happy with my child no matter what. As long as they are good, loving people, I could care less""

Do you see how this response is different from yours? Instead of *attacking* FIL for his old-school beliefs (which will absolutely never help him to understand), you can instead articulate to him a more positive and uplifting reference frame he can use to view this topic in the future.

Here's the thing, while he may seem bigoted, often times, people like this are reacting to fear of change in what they consider *their* society. Next time, maybe it will help both you and FIL more if you demystify these topics to him and shed a little bit of sunlight on the issue for him. I'm sure he isn't consciously being hateful. It's *ignorance*, so enlighten him through education, not demands.


If he then proceeds to argue that ""I don't consider trans people to be people""...well then a reaction like yours is more called for."
He doesn't respect women at all. Please don't let your sons grow up thinking that is okay.
"Yup. My aunt wouldn't listen to anyone about some stuff to do with her health, until I found some *very old* Dr Oz episodes (before he turned into a snake oil salesman) on YT that basically rattled off her symptoms and said 'if this is you, see a doctor' and she finally finally got her lung cancer diagnosed and treated."
"My dad does this with Jehovah's Witnesses when they come to the door. ""I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE!!! I'M SO LONELY! I HAD A STROKE MANY YEARS AGO AND MY FAMILY DOESN'T LISTEN TO ME ANYMORE WHEN I TELL THEM ALL MY MANY TROUBLES!"" They book it on out of there like their hair is on fire and their ass is catching. "
"&gt; You've both been together only 24 months, that's actually nothing given how young you are. You have time.

She's 30. Two years is long enough for them to figure it out. Does she want biological kids? Does she want more than one? Sure, she could give him some space for a few weeks, maybe a few months, but I think two years is more than enough to have a full conversation about if marriage, when marriage (at least a reasonable forecast), etc.

It's okay to talk about things directly. I agree she needs to listen to what he wants as well, perhaps first. Then they can see if they can find something that works for both of them, or not."
"Also, Melbourne Central is a multi story shopping centre. He could have picked up a baby blanket for $10 max."
"Trust your gut feeling!!

&gt; like it's a flaw that he's being nice enough to overlook

Unless he's completely oblivious socially when he says this, that's *exactly* how his comments are intended to make you feel. It's called negging: a backhanded compliment designed to throw you off balance and feel the need to earn his praise and affection by continually ""proving yourself"" in case he changes his mind and finds you inadequate in some way.

I'm a person who likes to assume the best in people, and I might have given him the benefit of the doubt still... if it weren't for 1) the fact that he's pointedly brought it up twice now, and 2) your gut feeling when he did."
"Right? I had to go back and check the title to make sure it said 'husband' when I read that. There's already a lot of other great advice on here, OP, but I also want to say that I think your husband is being incredibly selfish and self-serving. 


It seems like his upbringing made him fairly 'me' focused, and that carried over into your marriage. He needs to get a reality check (marriage counseling) and start treating you like a partner he *respects*. Otherwise, I wouldn't personally want to share my life with someone who made me constantly feel like I was anxiously trying to prove my financial worth to them at every turn. 


And if I had to guess, I doubt finances is the only area of your marriage where he's making you feel lesser than. You deserve to be treated as an equal partner. "
"&gt; What are you doing playing video games while you're 3 year old is up and you're the only parent home?

Right. What does OP think his wife does when she's at home alone with the kid? She's most likely playing with him, reading to him, entertaining him, spending time with him. Not doing her own fun stuff and ignoring the kid."
I guess I should ask my sister. You have a good point. I Skyped her earlier. Everyone waived and showed me their catch of the day.
"OP, I suggest you buy her a bus ticket back to her parents' home.  That girl and her lover treated you too badly for her to expect to just move in with you and be financially supported for an indefinite length of time.  Until she recognizes how badly she behaved - and she is still refusing to do so - I don't think you should put yourself in a position to be taken advantage of.  You can be kind and help her out, but don't let her into your home. tbh, I think you'd come home one day and find T sprawled out on your couch and expecting to live with you also."
"I think the only hard line you should draw right now is that birth control line. She needs to be protected herself, shit happens, condoms break, and at that age being 'in the heat of the moment' can lead to poor decisions, etc. Birth control gives her some control over her own body and a backup if the condom breaks again.

I would say bring her to the gyno (maybe preferably a female gyno) and let them talk to her about it if you think she'll rebel against you. There you can get her an std test, the gardasil vaccine, etc. Tell her you love her and will always support her, but that she needs to learn how to be safe, take care of herself, know she can say no, know who to reach out to if there is an issue, etc. She won't be punished for being sexually active. She is too young imo, but while it may not be common, it does happen. 

If she's in a committed relationship then that is the best case scenario. It might be good for you to meet the guy too, not to scare him, but so that there's a connection to him, and so you know who he is. Maybe it will put your mind at rest?

I certainly wouldn't say, OP, that you have failed as a mother. Society is a sexually saturated. Sex is a status symbol, and she's dating an older guy. It's good they're using condoms. I would commend her for making sure of that, and also say how proud and grateful you are that she told you - if anything these things should make you feel like you succeeded as a parent. She's being as safe as she could, and she told you when something went wrong. That's wonderful! Don't feel like you failed. 

For future, don't act disappointed in her, you don't know her relationship; if they've been dating for two years then it's likely a healthier situation than most people lose their virginity in. She doesn't need to be made to feel like she's bad or dirty for wanting to express her sexuality with someone she cares about, but I would draw that hard line about having her on birth control, etc. 

I hope that helps!

"Jesus, I know that feeling. It really adds a layer to the cruelity  that he was two facing you. 

sorry if that sounded bitter, I'm having issues."
He also pressured her into getting a surgical procedure that has literally cost her the chance of having a biological child ever! This guy is literally the scummiest of scum! 
"NOOO!! Do you realize how fucking embarrassing it would be for her, to have complete strangers talking about her, pitying her. Dissecting her mental health, her insecurities and her background."
"Yeah, these kinds of comments are great. It's probably not welcome to be sitting down your hypothetical kids and saying, ""Are you gay? You can tell me if you're gay."" But indicating support for gay and trans people with inclusive language and a demonstrated awareness and support for queer and trans issues is what my parents did, and i had very little fear to tell them I was bisexual :) they were already so good at not assuming I was straight, it was just more of a confirmation that they should keep not assuming!"
"I mean, how long is it going to take before you realize you're not his priority? I know you've been dating him since you were 20 so it seems scary to break up... but come the fuck on... when is enough enough? 

Another classic ""dude is at least a decade older than his girlfriend and treats her like crap"" relationship."
"I feel I should also add that isolation is a primary move on his part. You and your family are expressing concern for her safety from a place of love - he is twisting that in her eyes, making her think that you are just controlling her and trying to break them up. 

After all, she's seen him playing with these animals, loving and kind - She thinks she's seen a side of him that you don't. Pressuring her right now only puts her on the defense. 

Ugh. My heart goes out to you and your family. Surviving a psychopath is no walk in the park.

"The IRS doesn't issue social security numbers, and what on earth would having an incorrect birthdate have to do with taxes?

"Take the ring to a jeweler who does custom commissions, have the stones reset into something you want to wear on the rare occasions you wear rings, *or else* have it made into a necklace that you will wear.

This actually makes a lot of sense. I've always been more successful. It would make sense they overcompensate to give her the same.
"If you do break up with him, maybe take your bird over to a friends house for the day so he cannot take it out on your pet! "
"Of course you're not getting the entire story. He is giving you the trickle truth and you're getting whatever information he feels is just enough to shut you up and make you forgive him. 

This is the kind of red flag you will be remembering when he comes up with other excuses for cheating on you after you're married. This time it's not his fault he couldn't tell a stripper from a hooker, next time it will be not his fault because you were too pregnant for him to feel like he was getting enough attention, then it will be some other excuse. 

He didn't just make a mistake one night and feel bad and try to make it right with you. He's only admitted to what he has because you found out. That's telling."

OP, I think your boyfriend should be taking charge if this. It's time for him to tell his parents to stop with the matchmaking. It's rude to disrespect his relationship with you.

"I feel like someone stole my mom's body, this is just not her normal behavior what-so-ever. She has been slowly pushing all of us kids away with out of norm behavior, but nothing like this. I've set many boundaries before and she'll act accordingly for awhile and then she'll just bulldoze through them again until I have to set her straight again. Usually it's regarding my fiancee, but this time it's not only with her but acting weird/inappropriate towards me too. The problem is I'm stuck AT my mom's house, I can't leave by myself or anything. My girlfriend is basically showing up with her dad and brothers as reinforcement and taking me out of here when she gets back."
"She's right to feel threatened and embarrassed. Hell, another co-worker WENT to her to tell her about your flirting. Something tells me that this is not as innocent as you're making it appear. YOu need to really consider what you're doing here or the only wife you're going to have is a work wife. "
"I think it depends on how feelings are conveyed to the therapist, also rapport between patient and therapist and history. How well the therapist knows the patient etc.

**If they think the child is in danger, then they do have a duty to report.** There's a fine line between ""I wish I'd never had him"" vs ""If only he wasn't alive/if only he wasn't in my life, my life would be so much better.""

One is a regret, the other may speak to a future action...depending on context and so on.

But yeah, OP's therapist shouldn't have been curt with her. CPS call though is debatable depending on how OP phrased things. Again, every mental health care professional MUST report threats to self, threats to others to the relevant authorities. So, a lot of it depends again on rapport and perception of patient."

If you can't gently approach him with requests for a change in behavior (and it seems you've been very gentle as far as I can tell) there's no way this can work long-term. I'd just sit him down and talk, just tell him flat-out he is misconstruing things that you say and that his blowing your comments out of proportion *does* annoy you. 

I'd also tell him point blank that if he *does* do something that you find inconsiderate or annoying, you won't make some indirect comment about it, you'll tell him directly. Otherwise he needs to stop projecting his own insecurities on your comments and actually listen to what you're saying instead of giving this kneejerk emotional response that doesn't address your comment at all on any objective level.

It means the universe gave you one of the best learning opportunities anyone can ask for.

&gt;girl supplies, contacts and other essentials. 

Girl supplies? Are they gold-dusted maxipads? Egyptian cotton tampons? Is her makeup made out of ground up vampires? Are you for real? How is ""girl supplies"" an ""essential""?

&gt;She's a fantastic woman and such a great, kind person.

Fantastic, kind people don't take their boyfriends for a financial *ride*. Fantastic, kind people *listen to their partners' concerns* and *adjust accordingly.*

What do you get for your money-- is she making most of your meals, organizing household stuff like the cable-guy or lawn care, doing all the shopping, cleaning the house and folding the laundry? 

In my situation, I don't make very much, either. I pay rent, and as much utilities as I can handle, I work as many hours as possible *and* I run the household, which includes not only things like shopping, cooking, cleaning and organizing, but I *lay the flooring* and *clean the gutters*. I don't have hardly *any* money for tithing or ""girl supplies"" (which are not required by law, FYI). 

You have made a transition with her all right-- you're her new dad. 

&gt;says she will pay for nearly everything when she's hired as a deputy. 

Deputy *what*? Deputy bank robber? In what universe does a deputy make that much more than 17.5? She'll make like 22k as a deputy, for a fantastic increase of *$110* more a week. And guess what else will increase with her income? Her *tithe*.  

Let's say she makes 30k as a deputy. That's 235$ dollars more a week. It's not that much more, it doesn't *double* her income.  

You need a budget, a chore rota or chore schedule, a household responsibilities list, and to draw boundaries *NOW*. If you marry this person without sorting out your expectations, prepare to take care of her while you bust your butt, forever. "

So, how do you move forward when you feel guilty for something that you have done wrong and the other person has no intention of taking your apology or letting you be in their life? Well, one thing that might help your wife with her guilt is looking to contributing to the community around her. Her cousin rightly doesn't want anything to do with her, but is there somewhere she can be actively helping people to deal with her guilt instead of wallowing in it? I personally volunteer with an organization that helps women in abusive relationships with resources to leave those relationships. Maybe your wife might join a Big Brother, Big Sister program, and take the lesson she learned about how she's been behaving as a human being and apply it to change the woman she is."

"Really take this in op, the adult woman you are dating is jealous of a 6 year old... to the point of crying fits... she throws tantrums... I mean that is disgusting and embarrassing. There is no healthy good future to this relationship. You need someone your daughter can look up to and consider a role model, not someone who's going to treat her as an opponent or weird sibling rival. She knew you had a daughter from the beginning (I assume and hope) this relationship has gone on way too long as is. Break up and focus on yourself and your daughter before entertaining another relationship for a while. The people you date and consider long term relationships with will have an impact on your daughter, and that should be taken very seriously. "

Get him to find a local place and job himself. where you can see how you work out together before being stuck in a situation that could go very wrong.

Don't give in to demands you are not comfortable with."
"I would just focus complements on the actions of her taking care of herself, simply calling her gorgeous and letting her know when her outfit hits the mark. All the above are appropriate and it's really flattering when a guy notices and appreciates not just the looks, but the *effort* behind the looks. You're still complementing her body, just it's less sexually-oriented and much more respectful.

Allow the rest to flow naturally as you get to know her and become more comfortable. You'll feel it's the right time when it gets to that point. 

It sounds like you're a very respectful person and that'll get you far. "
"Don't take her in. You know she's only going to start trouble, she treated you like shit in the past, and living with a baby is hell. 

Maybe your parents can take her in. But she's now paying for her shitty decisions. "
"Whoa. It is horribly rude for your father to 1) not ask you for the honor of having you as his best man and 2) plan the wedding on short notice and without asking your schedule, considering you are supposed to be in the wedding party. 

If you can easily reschedule with your mother, then I guess you can attempt to do that. Can you still see her for the same duration of time, but in a different month/holiday? Like instead of 2 weeks at Christmas, can you do 2 weeks in summer? Plan it out, like buy your tickets ASAP so that you are truly committed to this new time with your mother. Ask her for financial help if necessary. But really commit to seeing her.

If you can't easily reschedule with your mother, then I would say take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to visit Dubai. You can celebrate with your dad when you return from your awesome, already-planned trip. Tell your dad you're sorry, but you won't be able to attend his wedding on such short notice. You are also sad to have to turn down his offer to be the best man. But you would love to celebrate with him on a later day and you are very happy for him."
She tried to get you fired because you didn't agree with her and she was states away. What makes you think she won't do something even more awful in your own home the next time you disagree with her life choices.
"Being bored to death or stressed out isn't an excuse to be inappropriate with another woman. Do a crossword puzzle, learn mindfulness, seek emotional support by texting your wife. Your wife is very justified in her feelings. "
"So your boyfriend finds it hilarious to ignore your boundaries and disrespect you. Fuck that. Don't date children who disrespect you. You aren't going to change him and honestly, I don't see why you should stay in the relationship. It isn't a joke if you don't find it funny. "
"&gt;I do not live at home... I have been self-sufficient since I was 18, and pay for college myself.

Then this is not your problem. "
"I don't think you're overreacting and your solution to find a new group is the best idea since no one seems to want to rock the boat in the group and defend you. 

I'd just ignore your boyfriend on this, honestly."
"Ah, good old trickle truth. Sounds like word got out and she's getting proactive."
I think you're an amazing person for offering this to OP :)
"No. 

Your brother threw a pissy hissy fit because he didn't get to spend time in a hot tub with several swim-suit clad girls, he failed in revenge to get their numbers, and now he's getting to reap the consequences. The fact that he cannot see the difference between a non-sexual three year old child, and a full grown eighteen year old being up close and personal with  bunch of seventeen year olds is neither positive nor a compliment to his attitude. 

You are not horrible. You didn't make him behave this way, you didn't force him to try to steal the numbers off your phone, you didn't say, ""If you don't do this, I will hurt you."" He's allowed to have his own choices, and he made bad ones. That's on him. 

Don't think of this as the reason he's being sent away. Think of this as the catalyst to a reaction that's been happening for a long time. If your brother has been always like this - it's my way or the highway - then your mom is probably sick of it and ready for a break. Having an eighteen year old have a tantrum over a hot tub is stressful and if he won't let it go now, it's showing her it was the correct choice. 

Stop answering the phone to him. Tell your mom, block his number for a bit. Go enjoy yourself for a while and ignore the overgrown toddler who doesn't get his own way anymore. "
"&gt; He doesn't see anything wrong with anyone sharing beds with their partners 

Lol, did you type that with a straight face?  You JUST told us that he does.  

Look, he's not going to change after marriage.  What you see is what you get.  That's the rule."
"Leave this well alone. Ben has handled it. 

You don't want to stir up additional drama for no reason. "
"Next time your brother gets out of control, call 911.  You shouldn't be in this position and your parents are failing you."
And calling him her future husband. 
"Here's a story! I [20F] had a rough looking guy (late 40s early 50s) parking outside my house everyday for ~4 months. They'd drive off once i came out of the house and one day i caught him and asked what he does all the time outside my house he said ""playing pokemon go"" (i played the game, there's nothing near my house) so months go by and i just keep an eye on him. then one day he was outside my house at 5am when it was dark, he pulled past my house, reversed, and parked in a spot where hes hidden but he'd have a perfect view of my house, then when i got home he was there again but right in front of my driveway so that day i called the cops and told them i keep seeing this car outside my house and i don't feel safe anymore. Turns out he lived in my neighborhood and the cops told him to play elsewhere. ever since then hes been spitting on my car windows. Ill never know if he had malicious intent but better safe than sorry. and really? its 2017 who plays pokemon go everyday anymore?? let alone at 5 am. or a 50yo.
TRUST YOUR GUT
EDIT: TRUST YOUR GUT"
"Kick your sister out. She's old enough to live on her own. Your girlfriend is someone who has busted her ass from the sounds of things to get where she is in life. I can relate to that. She has her eyes on the future, she has her priorities straight. I can see why she gets annoyed at your sister. It's really easy to not do laundry when someone is in the shower. It's really easy to let the person who has to go to work use the shower first. She puts her needs and wants above everyone else's. She has no respect for you or your girlfriend, she doesn't even respect your property. This seems really cut and dry. Kick the sister out, apologize to the girlfriend. "
"I came in here expecting to see some off-the-wall, vile stuff, and all we have is some rather benign flirting and allusions to shower sex with winky faces? 

OP, I think you'll live through this. Maybe even play along, your GF sounds like she's in it to win it. 

"
"Do you think it's possible you got married too young?  A lot of people aren't ready to focus on preparing for a family at age 22.  You might want to talk it through with a counselor and figure out your way forward.  Be honest with your wife, and don't act on any crushes while you are married.  Good for you for examining your thoughts and feelings and not just acting on impulse!"
"First of all, I am SO sorry that this happened and that you've been getting harassed rather than supported. I'm glad at least your younger siblings have your back.  

I'd recommend counseling/therapy if you can afford it. Having people you love and trusted betray you like this is a lot to process. I would also write up a letter or have a serious discussion with your parents, possibly bringing up some of the points below--

First: Draw up boundaries and consequences. (Note: most important thing about consequences is sticking to them 100%.)

- If anyone breaks your trust again by giving out your new number, you will not speak to that person for a [time frame you decide] and they will be put on an information diet.

- The Paul issue is not up for discussion. At all. Any mention of it results in them being asked to leave or you getting up and leaving (depending on where you are), plus a [time frame you decide] of not seeing that person. 

- You send a cease and desist letter to Paul stating past/current actions and harassment have been thoroughly documented and future harassment will be reported to the authorities. (If you haven't already started a journal, it would be good to do so-- they're helpful if you end up needing a restraining order.)

- Repeatedly ignoring your wishes will eventually lead to low contact and potentially *no* contact. This part is, of course, something that you have to decide yourself. It isn't even something you need to mention to *them*... It's just good to have a worst-case scenario planned. If you're willing to be treated like the bad guy indefinitely because you want them in your life that badly, that's up to you. If not, it seems you'll have to take a stand and start protecting yourself because they have not stepped up to protect you. 

I'd also give them some things to reflect on.

- Why are *you* the one being put through hell when you did nothing wrong? What happened with Paul was hard enough. Your trust was violated. Your health was put in danger. Your emotions were toyed with. NONE of this was *your* fault, yet your own parents are treating Paul *better* than they are treating you. It's Twilight Zone material, honestly. This has been going on for the better part of a year -- at this point it's become abusive/coercive behavior. If Paul or ANY of them genuinely cared about *you* and not just the role you are ""supposed"" to play in their lives, they would have stopped this months ago and allowed you the time, space, and support you deserve.

- Why is the NEIGHBOR more important to them than their own daughter? They've been making this preference clear for *months* with both words and actions. It's severely damaging the relationship they have with their own child. They need to WAKE. UP.

- If it's ""image"" that's most important to them, ask how they think trying to force their daughter back into the arms of a cheater looks? It's trashy in the same way telling your daughter to get back with some guy who beat her is trashy. No. 

- What Asshole did was not some *accident*. It wasn't some one-time encounter he immediately confessed to. He was having a sustained physical AND emotional affair before you two were even *married*! Goodness knows how long/how many times he would have cheated if you had not found out. You are right to want more for yourself. Refusing to be some hollowed-out Stepford wife that rugsweeps hideous behavior should be celebrated, not punished.  

I hope things work out for the best, OP. I wish you strength. &lt;3"
Fell out of 2nd story window and got caught. Holy shit balls. Talk about right place right time. That neighbor was obviously a ninja. 
"I don't think she will ever understand... To her, this is perfectly fine behavior. 

To the rest of the world, this is nuts ...

"
"Seriously to a friend of 20+ years you should be able to say this. This is the most appropriate answer.

My friend was basically being exploited by another person. When the situation was explained to me the first words out my mouth were, ""what the fuck is wrong with you? and ""how do you still have any contact with this person?""

Harsh, yes. But it was my best friend who I was feeling outraged for."
"She's a good friend, she knows she would be seem by someone sooner or later. Go on congratulate her.

Just don't make it weird."
"Keep it short and sweet and very vague. - it's an honor to be part of the ceremony. - two people found love. - cheers to the happy couple. The end. Speeches don't have to be long and heart felt. A few sweet words will suffice. DO NOT mention being ""surprised"" about being a MOH or how your relationship wasn't always great. You don't have to try to be clever or funny. Just stick to some nice things and then pass the mic. "
"So, your situation sounds difficult and I don't have advice for most of it but as a full-time freelancer who does fairly well, I have some advice on that front. Stop under-charging. Full stop. Set up a professional website, market yourself as an expert, and charge expert-level rates. Play up whatever credentials and experience you have and don't get down on yourself for being a beginner freelancer. You need to figure out a minimum hourly rate that will relieve your financial stress (mine is $30/hour) and then only go after higher paying jobs. Freelancing is all about attitude. Once you gain confidence and charge more, those annoying clients who want to pay you peanuts and come back with countless revisions and pay their invoices late will vanish. The more you charge, the better your clients will treat you. It's not fair, but it's how it works.

You may also want to use a couple hundred bucks from your savings and pay a professional resume writer/career coach to figure out what you're doing wrong on your resume and cover letters. If your resume is doing its job you should at least be getting interviews. Also, check out flexjobs. If jobs in your area don't pay well, look for remote work on there.

Good luck!"
"Let's  be clear.  The boy is an innocent and you should definitely step up and be his father.  Do  NOT tolerate abuse from your wife for your son or yourself.

But...from your wife's point of view...she did everything right.  She's a good wife, a good Christian, and prayed for years for a baby.  And some other woman gets to give you a child???  She sounds pretty traditional so in her mind she is a failure as a woman and a wife (not accurate of course).  So...she is a seething cauldron of resentment, self hatred, jealousy, and fear that God let her down.  THIS IS DANGEROUS.  

You need to demand marital counseling.  And with a real therapist not another pastor that will tell her to pray.  She needs to deal with her loss of her dream of being a mother.  She needs to learn to treat your son with respect and hopefully love.  She needs to deal with the slow realization that if she had trusted science instead of prayer she would have children of her own right now.

If you keep trying to keep everyone happy you will end up alone and miserable.  No 16 year is going to put up with the evil stepmother glaring at him and showing in tons of little ways how much she hates him.  And your wife will self destruct this marriage to punish you.  Start now...you don't have much time."
"Generally, an introvert doesn't get that same drained feeling around a significant other, especially after 3 years. 4-6 hours a week is insulting &amp; simply not fair to you"
"If they're in the same friends group, and it comes out the OP knew but didn't say anything, that could poison OP's life, too."
"TBH sounds like a lot of you have strange conceptions. 

I'm a single asexual man. I have many female friends both single and otherwise. I make it pretty well known that I have no interest in dating or fucking anyone. I send strong signals to women that I'm not going to date, or that the relationship won't go anywhere and I enjoy being single. 

I do enjoy physical contact, and regularly (platonic) snuggle with my female friends who are ok with this. 

The only awkward thing that happens to me is I get a lot of flirty women in relationships. Maybe they think of me like a gay friend or something fuck if I know. 

There's nothing wrong with being friends with single women, regardless if you're gay, straight, asexual or other. The important part is setting boundaries. "
"I'm so sorry you're going through this.

You're absolutely being reasonable about never wanting to live with this man again. It's absolutely reasonable to never want to communicate with him again, now matter how much he tries to buy you. 

Unfortunately, you cannot control what your mother does, even if her decisions are destructive.

Keep talking to her about your concerns, but more importantly, start making a concrete game plan to get YOURSELF out of there if she decides to move him back in anyway. 

I know you don't think moving is a good option with your anxiety, but do you really think that your panic disorder will IMPROVE with an abusive pedophile back in the house?"
"I was in the exact same situation as you - I moved in with a guy, and he ended up hating my bird and kicked me out with zero notice.  It progressed from the guy making me keep my bird downstairs, to keeping the windows shut to minimize light, to covering his cage with a towel as soon as I left for work, leaving my poor bird in complete darkness for eight hours a day.  I still hate him and his roommates for it.  I don't care how annoying an animal is being - you NEVER abuse it like that.

Anyway, to be concise - Your boyfriend's hatred of your bird will only grow.  Your bird has been your friend longer than your boyfriend, and will love you until the day she dies.  Can you say the same of him?  Please don't ever give her up."
"My wife is very much set in her ways to the extent it can be infuriating at times. I would call her God fearing, whereas I believe God is love. Everything is fire and brimstone with her. Very much black and white. There is no convincing her that being gay is okay. She thinks her kid is going hell if he doesn't smarten up. When she says hurtful things to Derek I know she's doing it because she fears for his soul. In her way she's helping.

She's not helping. I've sat her down. We've talked about this more times than I can count. She's impossible. And, oh, does she ever go online to look at ""resources"". She wants to find some sort of treatment for Derek so he can live a normal life. I've said a firm no, no way, never going to happen, over my dead body. 

Honestly, I'd probably have better luck communicating with a brick wall.

"
"So...what you're saying is, when you cook, you're the one who does all the cleaning, and when he cooks, you're the one who does all the cleaning. 

That sounds like a pretty unfair double standard that you need to address with him."
"Tell your school.  They will hopefully have resources to help you.  Let them know you can't take it, you're afraid of him, and don't know how to get help."
[deleted]
"&gt; he says ""would you be mad if I went tonight"" and I say ""yea I kinda would be.""


Why?"
"Does the school definitely know that Roy Rogers...es... are non-alcoholic? It's easy to assume that every drink with a name has alcohol in it. Possibly the teacher thought Jason had an alcoholic drink, made a fuss, and is now too embarrassed about their mistake to cancel the meeting. 

Anyway, I'd emphasize at the meeting that this was a pub-style restaurant, not a bar. "
"If you've been dating for a year and are serious but you're worried about him seeing you ""in a gown with glasses on"", you might not be mature enough for a true serious relationship.

Look, I understand not wanting him around when you're hospitalized. But at some point in your months-long rehab a serious relationship should survive him seeing you outside your best-dressed, primped, contacts-in persona. You don't need to ask him to help you with your ADLs, just... hang out and chat."
[removed]
"&gt; When I was working a conventional schedule we split chores 50/50. Now that my schedule has changed he expects me to do most of the cleaning and errands even though I technically work 60+ hours a month more than him.

OK, so you did 50/50 before and now he wants you to do more than 50%, even though your work hours are split about 70/30 comparatively?  Yeah, that's not fair.

I think because of the schedules, you should still do a 50/50 split, but you need to change how you divide chores.  He should take care of daily chores like cooking, tidying, sweeping, and half of the weekly chores like cleaning the bathroom.  You should take half the weekly chores but do them on your two weeks off...so he would clean the bathroom the two weeks you are working, and you would do it the other two weeks.  And then you take on the chores that only need to be done once or twice a month, like mowing the lawn, etc.  And you should SPLIT the deep cleaning and do it together on a weekend when you are BOTH home."
I would really like to hear the wife's description of his cleanliness. Wet towels on the ground? Dirty plates everywhere? Doesn't take out the garbage unless asked?
"If he wanted to go around and sleep with other women, he should've broken up with you out of respect. You don't seem on board with this because you state that you just didn't have any interest in the online dating and meeting guys. If it was meant to be, he would've came back to you realizing it was a mistake. The fact he feels he's missing something because he's young and 'stuck' with you is crazy."
"Geez, you sure you still want to get married? This kind of reaction is only a hint of what will come later."
"You need to show up in front of his friends and state that he a fucking loser who stalked you and you have never slept with him.  That will put a rest to this.

Or.

Your BiL and sister need to have a family meeting where everyone asks the creep wtf his problem is and make him promise to tell everyone he lied.  "
"Take the tithe completely out of the priorities conversation. She is committed to it, so don't waste your energy arguing it. Consider it a fixed expense. It's the other 90% you should be worried about. 

"
"To add, changing a diet for a pet drastically could cause diarrhea and dehydration. If you switch just brands of food you're supposed to do it gradually over a few weeks. And that's even when they're good brands with high levels of protein. "
Fallow up advice. The only exception your boyfriend doesn't seem to be a doormat is when it comes to telling you what you can or cannot do. Are you sure you want to stay with him? 
"This is f'd up on so many levels.  You have my sympathy.
"
"Look man, I've been the Brad in your story before, and if I were him, I'd be very glad that you are no longer a part of my life. Personally, I'd be surprised you think I have any interest in rekindling that friendship.

So feel free to ask, but don't be surprised if Brad has little to no enthusiasm about becoming friends again, and also don't get surprised or upset if he says no."
Then OP can move out - she doesn't have a leg to stand on here. Asking her dad to kick out his gf &amp; her son is ridiculous. 
"This isn't relationship advice (you'll get plenty of that from others here), but I recommend taking immediate steps to maintain autonomy over your own health. An IUD or an implant would both be long lasting, extremely effective, reversible (when *you* decide) contraception options that are difficult for your partner to sabotage."
"Probably true but if OP is going to do it he should only pay critical medical invoices he has in his hand and not just give them a lump sum.  And he should decide and agree with his wife a clear cap going in.

Maybe I'm a cynic but my experiences have been pretty fucking terrible in this area."
"&gt;Imagine my surprise when I walk into my garage and there's a gorgeous 20 something stripped down a sports bra and bike shorts sipping beer with my husband [...] She was exceedingly friendly and my kids fell in love with her because she's super exuberant and was tickling and wrestling with them in the first few minutes. 

As a 23 year old woman who is, at best, a 7/10 in the looks department - it's SO DIFFICULT to find male friends that wouldn't jump on trying to get with me the second my SO and I were to break up (God forbid). I have no male friends that know about my hobbies let alone share an interest. She's probably hounded on the regular by guys who think she's just so sexy because looks+male-dominated interest. That's why there's a gamer girls trope. That's why there's a ""girls who can chow down on a hamburger and look sexy"" trope. 

It must be refreshing that your husband is giving her zero sexual attention and is just interested in biking with her. She's probably super grateful and was excited that your husband is married with children because that even further solidifies her feeling safe and unsexualized.

I don't think you really have anything to be worried about, tbh. I mean the fact that he's brought her around the house, around the kids, around you and he ONLY hangs with her when they're biking is pretty suggestive that he's just excited to hang out with someone who's as dedicated to the sport as he is. 

Edit: Because I've been getting some weird ass comments/PMs. I do have several male friends, but none of them share my hobbies which is totally fine. They're interested in other aspects of my life and are good people. I had to weed through a lot of creeps to find my people. "
"Tell your wife to talk to you about marital problems, not your friend. If you need a 3rd party, get into marriage counseling, don't go to your friends. 

You should be just as pissed at your wife as you are at your friend. She's the one taking her problems outside of the marriage. What he did was inappropriate, but no more so than what she did."
"Jesus.

Dude got days' worth of birthday celebration and he's sad because he doesn't get another? Wait - he gets it, but he doesn't get it exactly how he wants. He gets ANOTHER cake but that's not perfect.

I am angry at his entitlement and am going to show myself out of this post.

You did NOTHING wrong."
Sounds right. He's been accused of being a sociopath by a lot of people and it's a hot button subject for him.
I immediately informed her of what happened and told her not to cancel her visit and that she is still going to be staying there with me. She has my back. I also called my parents and informed them of what happened and my dad (the aunt is his sister) was instantly reassured that she's coming. So my family knows and they will back me up if something requires it. She will definitely help me make a plan.
"Honestly, it sounds like after $friend assaulted you and you shot him down, he could be nosing around your relationship because he's a jealous asshole and be of the mentality ""if I can't have her, no one can.""

There's no reason for this guy to involved in any facet of your relationship. 

What it comes down to is your boyfriend keeping his word and you knowing where to draw the line in the sand to end it with your boyfriend if he can't keep his word. "
"""I need to let you know that Sakura isn't actually my real name -- it was the name I had at birth before I was adopted. I like to use it online for privacy. My real name for the hotel reservation is Mary Johnson."" 

If they care or hold it against you, they're the ones being weird and petty. I don't even know why you had to provide a birthday, but they shouldn't care about that either unless for some reason you made a big deal about it."
"Yup, abnormal woman reporting in here too.

If my SO woke me at 8am on a weekend morning for sex, he can sleep in his own room on friday and saturday nights, thanks.

I need my sleep. Don't wake me up before my alarm rings because I guarantee you, unless you have a good reason for it (like oh the apartment is on fire), I will not wake up happy. And making your SO grumpy is not how one goes about getting sex.

Also, look OP, everyone and anyone has the right to say no. Just because you're in a relationship or you're married doesn't remove that choice. No means no. And if your husband/SO sulks about it, well tough shit. (Of course, I mean this in a healthy, non-dead-bedroom situation.) Sex should never be an obligation, it's a privilege (for both parties) and an expression of love or lust."
"Her official response is that she ""can wear whatever she wants."" I am ""being controlling"", ""accidents happen"" and I am overreacting. Then she threw her engagement ring at me and said that she's ""sick of my shit"" "
Your husband's own doctor is going to be more of a help in his specific case than a rando cardiologist who hasn't seen his bloodwork. Ignore your mother--she's being extremely petty and you don't need this shit.
