[Inwood Hill Park is a natural growth forest at the northern tip.](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/inwood-hill-park) This is where the bald eagles lived a while back.  There's also people who have different types of nature hikes through the park.

For nature, go to the parks around the city.  Mostly small animals, but you'd be surprised at the wildlife that we have.  

There's also botanical gardens.  Sure, they're planned out, but there's some beautiful plants at them:

[Bronx botanical garden](https://www.nybg.org/)

[Brooklyn botanical garden](https://www.bbg.org/)

[Queens botanical garden](https://queensbotanical.org/)

[Staten Island botanical garden](http://snug-harbor.org/) (It's actually called Snug Harbor).


Check the meetups, but be warned that you might go out for a drink after your hike or your bike ride or whatever you do.  NYC apartments can trend to the small side, so it's just easier to meet outside the house. 

Personally, I'll stick with my eat out/go out activities, but the city can be enjoyed no matter what your desires.

EDIT: I'll just mention that I live in northern Manhattan, so my ideas tend to center around there.  But you can search for NYC parks in your area - the Parks Dept websites will tell you the activities that can be found in each park.  Look around meetup.com to find other activities that you can group up with.

"The only thing that bothers me is when there's a scene set in the subway and it's either \(a\) not the right line for the station or \(b\) obviously not a NYC subway station. I'd assume it's difficult to actually film on location so it is what it is, but it definitely takes me of the the story for a bit."
"1. It's hard to get to Staten Island without a car and it's hard to get around Staten Island without a car. The ferry only has two stops, so it's not super versatile if you have no way of getting to it in the first place, and imagine having to rely on it in the dead of winter. The express bus is &gt;2x the cost of normal MTA fare. The SIR may as well not exist.

2. It has a very different culture/atmosphere from the rest of the city. Yes, it's more conservative, but it also doesn't *feel* like you're in the city. It feels like you're in a suburb of NYC."
"* Wake up after snoozing at least 1 more time than I could to make it on time.

* realize I have to leave 10 minutes ago to be on time to be there on time or 30 minutes ago to be there early like I've been swearing to myself I'm going to do (or 2 hours ago to workout before work lol).

* Convince myself I'll either get a speeding bullet train or every light will be green, the wind will be at my back, and the streets will be empty on my morning bike commute.

* Show up late - work all day, usually through lunch.

* Get loaded with a pile of stuff to do before leaving, feel guilty and have to prove myself - work late.

* Get home late - 7 or 8. Eat bachelor chow (Ramen) for with frozen veggies and eggs for dinner again.

* Putt off side gig or personal projects convincing myself I'm almost done or it'll only take 30-40 minutes.

* Start doing side gig or personal projects around 9 or 10, continue until 12-2 depending on progress and deadlines.

* Oversleep again, rinse repeat.

* Come Friday, try and scrounge together some form of social life.

* Get embarrassingly drunk often alone at some local dive.

* Hit on anything with a pulse

* Inevitably get rejected or shamefully Irish exit in moment clarity

* Wake up hungover as all balls the next day cursing that I can't drink like I used to.

* Masturate to deprived esoteric internet porn for 2 hours while trying to find the motivation to be productive.

* Cry deeply at my own pathetic loneliness and and decaying body in spite of being in the city of dreams surrounded by young, beautiful successful people.

* Pop valium and smoke weed while watching nostolgic 90s TV (mostly cartoons) to cheer myself up while texting people who have long since moved on and have kids and houses and careers and shit.

* Living zombie rest of weekend

* week restarts.


Am I doing it right?"
"""Hey, just wanted to let you know that I've been seeing a few roaches in the bathroom lately. Can you arrange for an exterminator?  Thanks!"""
"You could realistically ask this of the world as a whole. Violent crime has trended down globally for almost 30 years, it’s been suggested that removing lead from gas and legalization and broader access to birth control are major contributing factors. Throw the near ubiquity of cameras and other forms of surveillance, better law enforcement funding and the changes in sentencing for non violent crimes and you get what we have today. "
"Moved to Staten Island from Manhattan a few years ago despite knowing little to nothing about the borough itself besides the typical doomsday things you read on the internet. I live in St. George, on the North Shore, with in quick walking distance of the ferry. I chose it for the easy commute to the fidi. I honestly love where I live and am glad I made the change. Sometimes I miss certain conveniences that came with living in midtown... but then I remember all the things I hated about midtown. What I've learned about Staten Island since I've moved here: 

-The food is great, particularly on the North Shore.

-It's tough to get around the island without a car, but since I don't feel the need to go many other places on SI besides the occasional beach/hiking trip, I'm content taking a bus or uber when necessary. My hood is very walkable. I have easy access to awesome restaurants, a great brewery, bars, sweeping skyline views, etc

-The North Shore really feels like an extension of Manhattan so I don't feel like I move to the 'burbs

-I love my ferry commute. It's by far the prettiest commute in the city. Better 30 minutes on the boat than on a train any day. 

-I was also told the boat is the most reliable public transit in the city. If that's true or not idk, but it does run considerably better than the subways, however the odd delays are inconvenient for sure

-Ultimately I'm much happier here than I was when I lived in Manhattan, and I don't find my commute to be much if any longer than co workers who live in other boroughs, or even northern manhattan

"Yes. Yes, it is.  Write your representatives."
"that would mean that in the marvel universe the MTA actually does their jobs.

now i love me some fiction, but that's just too unrealistic for my liking."
Attempt to murder my liver and forget why I hate myself.
This is the first time anyone's ever made Staten Island seem kinda nice.
"If it's a co-op - there's a co-op board! That's a good thing. Get them involved via your owner. There should be house rules, and I'm sure noise is on there. If they are violating noise rules, they can get fined by the co-op."
i fucking love you for saying bing 
"Well, if it's not, no one in history of ever has cared enough to enforce any kind of rule, as evidenced by the dozens of hammocks in Central Park on any give nice weather day. If you don't want to chance it, head to Gov Island, which opens today, and has already set up hammocks for your use"
"Recently I was watching a show and a character described their apartment as ""deep, deep Bushwick"" but their commute showed them getting on the L at Jefferson and I laughed."
"&gt;Meanwhile, there haven't been significant demographic or socioeconomic changes.

Well this is not true, so I think that explains a lot of it. NYC was a very different place in the 1970s and 80s leading up to 1990. One surprising statistic is that NYC lost over 10% of its population between 1970 and 1980 and didn't recover until the late 1990s."
Maybe give them less coffee? 
WOW THIS IS AN AWESOME LIST. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! makes me way more excited for nyc. Thank you so much for taking the time to write this up 
"It common practice in NYC

 it how rich international students pay for rent


Chinese female friend had to pay full year because she had no credit school etc etc "
"I live in Williamsburg but my job takes me to Staten island 2-3 times a week. Si is beautiful, imo is the nicest looking Burrough in that there's nature (I see turkeys, birds, and deer pretty often), coast, and a lot of historic buildings and homes. The food is also great, like it's the real little Italy. That being said a lot of the people aren't great, lots of 'alpha' folks and jerks. 

Tldr- great food / not so great people. "
"Nah fuck that noise, nobody gets to ignore you when you ask them to quiet down at 2am. Go to war with this piece of trash."
This. You are way overthinking it OP.
That sounds like more a function of growing older then having the city change you. I'm the exact same way.

"Yes, it's normal. But don't provide a check if you haven't seen the place in person (I'm assuming you have but so many people fall for scams relating to fake apartments that I feel like I have to say it)."
"yes. educated, well-off minorities can be gentrifiers too. "
"Ignore it. 

I don’t see what you’re wearing ever has to do with it. I’ve been catcalled wearing sweats, wearing jeans &amp; tee, wearing dresses, etc. It doesn’t matter what you wear, it’ll still happen. Being catcalled while I’m wearing a dress isn’t more welcome than being catcalled when I’m wearing gym clothes - its all fucking annoying. 

That being said, as soon as you engage well... you’re engaging. And that’s what they want. Unless someone is physically touching or blocking you, or you feel like you’re in danger, ignore it."
"Apply for unemployment immediately while you're looking for a gig, if you don't make enough in the new gig they may still cover a portion of the difference of what they'd pay for no job.

Also a requirement for unemployment is to be actively looking for a job so it seems like a natural move to me.

"
I've never done that but will for this issue. I can bing it but do you know who I should write?
"In very general terms, I think of anything below 14th as ""downtown,"" anything between 14th and 59th as ""midtown,"" 59th and 125th as ""uptown,"" and 125th+ as ""upper Manhattan."" "

Since you work nights you can try to get a part time maybe 2-3 days a week at a fast food spot near your job maybe a 4-10pm .


I’m surprised you say ur a doorman that your living  check after check  ,  I thought I heard union approved  $23/hour rise 
You can try to cut down on some bills , drop the cable and just go Internet , prepaid cellphone etc etc , move to a cheaper tiny apartment 



Edit: study at night at work and get ur GED, it open more opportunities. "
No. I’ve never seen them checking any bags at all. Just standing at a shitty folding table looking bored. 
"Not much, but probably I'm more mentally isolated while walking around. I used to be more involved with the experience, but now I just ignore everything and everyone. I really don't give a fuck about what's going on, and move around hoping that whatever it is, it won't affect me. "
"Now that I know better people to buy drugs from, my habits have changed to include buying more drugs"
I'm friends with an F Train conductor and I can ask him when I see him next time in the neighborhood.
"Of course you can be a gentrifier regardless of if you're black, latino or any other sort of PoC -- if you are well-off and displacing poor people.  Gentrification is, literally, replacement of poor or working-class people by the ""gentry"" - middle to upper-middle class educated professionals.

"Major con: The lack of subway is super inconvenient. 

Major pro: the Sri Lankan restaurants there are bangin, especially since Sri Lankan food is rare in the other boroughs"
"Ding ding ding, this. I know I’m an outlier, but I work in midtown &amp; my job gets out around 11 PM. I had a coworker who commuted to Staten Island, and if she missed her boat she was hanging around the terminal, just waiting to get home. That would make me crazy. Same reason I can’t live in Westchester. "
I know a few people who have had success in asking hotels in their area about gym access - a friend of mine who lives in Hell’s Kitchen got a $125 year long membership at a hotel two blocks from his apartment for example. Might be worth a shot 
"Most of the time it's just an ""ah, cool, I know that place"" moment. I get a little annoyed when something happens that most people wouldn't notice but locals definitely would. 

One of the things I loved about Mr. Robot so much was the insane attention to detail, and that generally all of the NYC related plot points or references were true. "
You don't even know this person and it sounds like you don't want the same apartment. 
"Staten Island desperately needs better integration with New Jersey. That actually isn't a joke.

There is precisely one transit link to NJ, the S89 bus over the Bayonne Bridge, which runs a limited schedule at peak hours only, and only gets you halfway up Bayonne where you have to transfer to the HBLR to even get to JC/Hoboken. (and more transfers to get anywhere else).

Want to get to a job in JC/Hoboken that doesn't fit peak hours? Fuck you. Want to get to a job in Newark? Plenty of express buses going by, none which stop anywhere in NJ, so fuck you, wave at it and  backtrack from Manhattan if you don't have a car. Etc.

Here's a not particularly crazy pitch to give that hole in regional transit networks a bare minimum patch: The S89 should run all day, and there should be at least one bus over the Goethals to Elizabeth and one over the Outerbridge to Woodbridge or Perth Amboy with similar schedules."
Ok you go and we’ll all follow!
"Take the kid to the playground, take the kid to the store, take the kid to the playground, take the kid to get coffee, put the kid to bed, watch tv, sleep.  Toddlers are wonderful, but fuck me are they exhausting."

Pretty sure it’s not legal. Same with card minimums at bars.
