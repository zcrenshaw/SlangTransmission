"Real answer: Strippers have people skills out the wazoo, and are extremely good at making an average schlub wandering in feel like he's the President or something. In short, being in a strip club makes a man feel important in the ways he wants to feel important and rarely does. 

That's actually the main draw, and then on top of it the strippers are hot, and at least *appear* sexually available in the way even wives and girlfriends often are not. Usually seeing some titties in real life requires a bunch of back and forth that is more like a job interview than fun, even if you're the kind of guy who aces both interviews and first dates. 

Much like nekkid pictures online, there is the luxury of choice, something most men are often denied. If one club's women aren't up to your standards, simply go elsewhere, and get what pleases you. 

Unlike online porn, though, strippers are real people in the present, affecting all five senses, not just the one or two that porn relies on. So their appeal is just that much more powerful. 

The typical strip club experience is of a man sitting comfortably at a booth, sipping a drink at his leisure, pretending like it's no big deal while a woman hotter than most displays herself for him and he can watch as much as he wants (usually looking at women he desires is treated as a sort of crime), or, perhaps the even greater luxury, he can blithely ignore her. Like a sultan would. 

Then, when he does, the stripper in all her professionalism drifts his way and gives him her attention without him doing much to earn it, and as I said the typical stripper doesn't just show her goodies, she is an expert at exuding idealized femininity and making men feel important. For an actually important and powerful man this may be how most people approach him, but for the guy at the bottom of the ladder this is a desperately addicting experience. Nowhere else in his life does he get to feel anything like this. 

Then it's back home to his wife, and feeling mundane, feeling unimportant, even back to having his sexual needs unmet, which is an unexpected but super common experience in marraige. Back to arguing with the girlfriend and feeling inadequate for some reason or another. Or back home alone, to feel altogether unvalued by women. 

Some men hope to date and have sex with the strippers, but most have few illusions about it. It's that rare feeling of being important to sexually attractive women that draws them back, again and again. For most men the titty bar is the only place they ever get to experience that, but it's something they start yearning for as soon as they enter puberty, or even earlier. "
"My friend tried to explain it to me years back: ""Have you never just been down there licking pussy, and you see she just has the most perfect asshole, and you say ""fuck it, I'm gonna lick that""?""

I didn't get it at the time till years later I saw it, the perfect asshole."
"I was on a date with this girl, she had all the right qualities. She was beautiful, funny, smart, had a sexy attitude, etc, etc...

We were at the beach, the date was going great, we clicked from the very start. By the end of the night, she was in my lap and we were getting sort of drunk... She then made a sort of mean remark on a black couple that was sitting near us and asked if we could move spots.

A few bottles later, she made another racist comment, so I indulged her to test the waters. Following ""my lead"", she began spilling the most nasty, disgusting, racist shit I have ever heard in my entire life. She couldn't know since I'm so white, but my father is black.

I decided to cut the date short. I went home drunk and with a hard on and had to furiously masturbate to ebony porn to sleep.

Fun night."
"I went to a bar, and a mutual friend of ours wearing a low cut top said hi to me. I said hi, made small talk for a minute and that was “encouraging her”. A female friend liked a post on Facebook and so I needed to unfriend all females on Facebook (I didn’t), and if I was out anywhere without her and spoke to a girl, that was cheating as far as she was concerned. 

Then, one day she casually mentioned a guy friend of hers was coming to visit, and since she had two twin beds in her bedroom, he was going to stay in her room. She could sleep in the same room as a guy I didn’t know but it was cheating if I spoke to another girl. 

My only regret is that I didn’t dump her sooner. "

"If she goes cold, let her go and find someone who will treat you respectfully. That simple, my man.

edit: thanks for the gold! "
"It's absolute misery but you don't realise it until you look back on it. All your days melt into one, you look forward to nothing, you lose interest in doing anything interesting but you think you're fine. You don't realise how bad it is until you break out of it."
"I have lost 40 plus pounds, my running had improved greatly and I am making strides in overcoming PTSD and have relearned how to be the source of my own happiness and while I am often okay with solitude I also have no friends and sometimes feel so alone that it physically hurts"
"In my case, I realized I wasn’t as in love with my first love as much as I thought. "
That was a stirring evocation of the allure of strip clubs. You are like the Henry David Thoreau of titty bars.
"Being a dead fish or acting like you're a dead body.  

""Alrighty, I guess I'll move your leg then.  Oh, all dead weight?  Sure, could have swore there was some muscle in this leg for moving it.  Did you give yourself roofies?  Okie doke, guess I'll just start molesting your unresponsive body.  Oh, you are awake, that's good."""
"Ball stomping, scat play, and licking dirty shoes or feet."
You haven't gotten to second base and you're already asking about eating ass? Damn these youngin's move quick. 
"That you should never fight/disagree. It's healthy to be able to talk through your disagreements and come to a conclusion/compromise. That doesn't mean you have yelling screaming matches and personal attacks to get your point accross. But lots of people say oh we're great, we never disagree about anything, and that usually means either one or both of them is holding back their real opinions or one or both doesn't care enough to put in the effort. "
"We were walking down the street all couply and shit (holding hands, etc.) when an attractive woman walked past us. We ended up having a massive fight because she checked her out and if she had checked her out then surely I had checked her out and I wasnt allowed to look at other women. She didn't believe me that I hadn't even noticed this chick... "
"Went on a second date with a girl. By ""sheer coincidence"" her ""ex boyfriend from highschool"" was at the same venue. She just wanted to pop over ""real quick"" to say hello. Half an hour later I realized she had snuck off.

Now... heres the thing. I suggested the venue, so my first thought is that was just shit luck. However, I know there are some couples who get off on stuff like this, so maybe she told him to meet her there. Either way, kind of a shitty thing to do."
"I found my missing other half after a year or so of self improvement and absolutely, expressly not looking for her.  

They found a brain tumor a little over a year ago.  I'm going to ride this train to the end of the line.  There will never be enough time with her, weather I get 50 more years or 50 more days, it won't be enough.  I think we have less than a year.  I hope for more, but I've watched her die in my dreams, too many times to get my hopes up. Pardon me, I haven't admitted this to anyone yet.   "
"Went on a second date after a stellar first date. Go to an Italian restaurant great food. The whole time since the first date she's asking when she can  meet my dogs because they are so cute. 

After a great meal I ask if she wants to come back to my place to meet the dogs. She says ""yes""; oh boy here we go this date is only getting better. We get to my place; she instantly starts sneezing and coughing. Turns out she's allergic to dogs. 

Drive her home never hear from her again. "
"""You're so big!"" No I'm not you lying cunt."
"Just give then an answer that disarms them and makes them unable to continue the discussion.

For example:

""You should get a girlfriend""

""OK"".

Don't tell them ""It's not the right time"" or ""I don't want to"", just ""OK"".

As for growing thicker skin. I think that you just need to learn to stop caring about such things. "

It would be awesome and quickly followed by regret because it totally went over my head and I realized it like two hours later... 
"&gt; ""'The second time you fall in love with someone, you’re going to feel so relieved. When you get your heart broken for the first time, you can’t imagine loving someone else again or having someone else love you. You worry about your ex finding love before you do, you worry about being damaged goods. And then it happens. Someone else loves you and you can sleep well at night.

&gt; The second time you fall in love with someone, it’s going to feel different. The first time felt like a dream almost. You were untouched, untainted by anyone. You accepted love with wide open arms and desperation. “Love me, love me, love me!” So you did. And then it fell apart and left you shocked to the core. You realized that people could be cruel and break your heart. You realized that people could stop meaning the sweet things they said to you just yesterday. So when you go into it again, you’re going to keep in mind everything that you’ve learned. You’re going to say, “Love me, love me, love me…until you don’t. In which case, I would like some advance warning. Thanks!”

&gt; The second time you fall in love with someone, you’re going to compare it to your first love. That’s okay. That’s natural. You’re going to be studying the new love with judgement and wariness. “My ex never liked broccoli. Why the hell does this one eat so much broccoli?!” Discovering that you have the ability to love multiple people who are different and feel different is initially very jarring. Loving an unfamiliar body will leave you disoriented and in dire need of a map. That’s okay too. That’s to be expected. Just ask the new love for directions.

&gt; The second time you fall in love with someone, you’re going to suffer from a bout of amnesia. You’re going to poke and prod at your lover’s body and be like, “Wait, how do I do this again? How do I love you? I think it starts with us having a moment together in some coffee shop, right?” It’s going to feel scary at first. Falling in love is sort of like riding a bike though. You never really forget.

&gt; The second time you fall in love with someone, you’ll be a more sane person. Your first love is when you get all of your insanity out. You behave like an insane monster because your mind is freaking out about all these new powerful feelings. By the second time, however, you have an idea of what works and what doesn’t. It’s by no means perfect. The insanity will make a cameo at some point. “Peek a boo. I’m here! Hope you didn’t forget about me!” But you can usually shoo it away after awhile.

&gt; The second time you fall in love with someone, you will hopefully have better sex. Do not quote me on this.

&gt; The second time you fall in love with someone will still be exciting and you might even talk about moving in together or marriage. It will feel more “adult.” You have no idea what adult love actually is but you think it involves making coffee for each other in the morning and maybe even getting a dog. “This is my dog, Xan. I got him with the second person I fell in love with because that’s what you do! The first person I was in love with would’ve killed a dog.”
The second time will not be the first time. The first time is an insane magical life gift that you can never reclaim. But that’s okay. The second time is more real anyway. The second time can involve some amazing love.'""


I have this quote saved that was written by Ryan O'Connell. I've never been in love so I only have this to share.

"I had a SO in school call me with her twin sister as a ""test"". Phones sucked back then, and their voices were very similar, so they used it to trick me. Her sister asked me all kinds of questions: favorite color, food, etc while pretending to be my SO. The next day, my SO was jealous I talked so flirty/casually with her sister. IT WAS YOUR PLAN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN."
"As the Woody Allen quote goes, ""Showing up is 80% of life."" I wasn't showing up, and as a result no one wanted to date me.

As soon as I made a commitment to going out and meeting people, women were interested in me. I acted like a massive cringelord at first because I'd never gotten attention like that before. It didn't matter because there is no central Weirdo Database that women look at before flirting with you, and I got better pretty quickly.

Moral of the story: Show up."
"“You can’t go to a concert with your friends unless I go too because there might be girls there.”

"Met a guy for drinks, we hit it off. We go back to my place to watch a movie, things get a little frisky. He starts giving me a blowjob. He was really good at it. Part way through, my dog makes a noise in her crate. He stops and asks “have you ever done anything with your dog?” I say no. Then he asks “can we let her out of her crate and try?”

I was like “yeeeeaaahhhh, no. And that’s not cool. You’re gonna have to leave.”"

"People associate couples in the ""puppy love phase"" with actual being great couples and it's just wrong. That's a chemical/hormonal thing that wears off in a year or two. It's the couples that have each other's back that I appreciate. Not the ones who won't shut up about each other."
"I try not to judge people by what they wear.

"&gt;what is the appeal?

"The enthusiasm of eating out vs blow jobs.

If we ate pussy like most girls suck dick, the girl would never get off.

Imagine being so close to finishing, then your partner just stops. Completely.

I understand your jaw/neck may hurt, but you can still jerk it while recovering. If you don't want to suck it, just say so! And don't complain! Could you imagine a guy complaining the whole time while eating you out? Just ruins the mood.

I'm not saying all guys are perfect at it, or all girls are bad, just that enthusiasm goes a long way with foreplay."
"Cuckolding, especially where there's extreme humiliation to the cuckolding. I don't think ""weird"" is the right term since so many men are into it (according to my internet experience). I just don't understand what's hot about imagining your loved one fucking someone else because ""his big cock feels soooo much better than your tiny worthless one""."
"First love is puppy love, makes more sense to YOU in the moment (I believe you lie to yourself way more the first time and ignore red flags because you ""finally have someone"") and hurts more than anything you could ever imagine when it ends, but isn't as real as the next I'd argue.

You're blinded more by puppy love, and that's dangerous yet beautiful at the same time.  You have to go through that initial pain of your first love (mistakes and all) to really appreciate what it means to love."
"I see this trend a lot. Men will start making a lot of money, get fit, improve their mental and physical health, etc but there isn’t much that can improve loneliness.

"We cuddle in the beginning but separate when we start to drift off.

And two covers, not a single big one. That's the key to happy marriage/relationship. I am a true believer in the fact that a single cover is the main reason for high divorce rates."
"So, I read your question as being about what to do about people you feel guilty for ghosting in the past:

I would say with that recent close relationship you had, where you then just lost interest and ghosted, a quick message ""hey, I want to let you know I'm sorry for dropping off the face of the earth, I should have just told you I just wanted to end things"" could be a nice gesture. But really, the relationship has already ended, contacting that person at this point isn't necessary and they might think you are trying to get back together or something. People from even further ago in your past don't need to hear from you, drudging up the past for an apology that would really be only to make yourself feel better for shitty behavior.

For the most part, about the people in your past, learn from them and if you run into them and chit chat maybe bring up you felt bad for ghosting them before but you're learning not to be that way. 

So yeah, learn from the experiences and in the future just tell people you don't want to date anymore. "
"Unwashed ass. I've brought this up with my girlfriend and she still doesn't fix it, I'm now at a crossroads of ""is this girl worth smelling a poop smell during sex for the rest of my life?"""

"The first time is like a punch to the gut. It's unexpected, and you don't know how or why you feel the way you do, but you just do. The feeling is more....unfiltered, and does not rely on any discernable factors. You just fall.

The second time, you know what you are looking for and what you expect. You feel the butterflies but you tend to hold them back to make sure that the feelings are real. It's more like a controlled experience. "
I'm a swimmer and when to the pool with a friend and she loaned me one of her caps. My gf got upset and asked what I was doing wearing her clothes.
"it is the overall passion for the booty. a nice ass provides its man with sexual arousal, an aesthetically pleasing experience, with gentle, yet soft comfort. and if she's into spanking and a bit of biting, you can let your inner animal go crazy. kinda all leads up to wanting to bury your face between those 2 beautiful, puffy, divine clouds and just go nuts. "
You could just reformat the entire computer. Nuclear option always works. 
"She's always on the left. I run suuuuper hot so there's not much cuddling but we often hold hands while drifting off, to the point that one finds the others hand when they're turning in their sleep. She'll be hanging off the end of her side but still a finger in the palm of my hand haha. 

Putting her hand in mine or vice versa is kind of important in our relationship. It's the 'can we talk?' signal after a conflict, so when we go to sleep, holding hands is a 'we're all good' message. "

"Geez this gives a vary depressing view of marriage.  If that’s how marriage really seems, I guess I totally get why men would want to frequent strip clubs "
"Went out with a girl that was pretty awesome in text messages and facebook. I went and picked her up and that was nice because we made out a lot before leaving. Well on the way to dinner things got pretty weird.

Her name was the same as one of the seasons of the year, I also had another friend that had the name of a different season. I joked that I just needed to find 2 more friends that had the other 2 names. Admittedly it was a bad joke but she kind of flipped out about how I better not do that and stuff.

I thought that was weird but figured it was nothing. We kept going and she eventually brought up that she was going to make me get circumcised before we ever have sex. I said thats not going to happen and she dropped it after getting a little huffy. Thats when I realized this might not turn into a good night.

The dinner itself was okay and as I was getting my credit card out to give to the waiter, I heard her say something to herself. I didn't pay attention because I really wasn't sure if I wanted to know what she said and then we decided to leave for the movie.

On the way to the movie, she had the idea that we should just go back to her place and mess around. It had been a while for me so I jumped at the chance. On the way back to her place she was basically like ""I'm not sure if you noticed back there but I'm really racist."" Apparently our waiter had been black and thats what she was talking to herself about. Turns out her entire family was actually full of legitimate white supremacists (I'm also a mixed child but you'd never know unless you saw my parents). Thats pretty much when I decided to end the date. I dropped her off, made up an excuse to leave, and then went home. I got a text saying she didn't think it was going to work out, so that was great. Then a few days later she left a message on my phone crying for me to give her another chance and then I blocked her."
Getting asked out on a date. 
"My last girlfriend did this. I told her I appreciated it and I enjoyed her company and would like to continue, but I wasn't there yet.

She ghosted me two weeks later.

"In my 20's I had an ex actually give me shit after watching 'American Pie' and then 'Van Wilder' directly after it. She actually accused me of having a crush on Tara Reid and proceeded to endlessly harass me about it. 

The relationship didn't continue much longer."
All the NJ drivers to simultaneously grow a fucking brain.
"2 actually.

Met a girl at a club, hit it off and invited her for a dinner date in a busy shopping/restaurant street. Dinner went great, until the police arrived and arrested her for shoplifting. Apparently, she did not pay for the great jacket she was wearing. I needed the help of the waiter to convince the police I arrived separately

The second was even weirder. Had a great first date, but she had to leave early for work. OK, Called her for a 2nd date and we agreed I would pick her up at her apartment in a big flat, where she lived with a few other girls. Rang the hall bell and she said she would come downstairs. She never did. Called a few times more, nothing. Left confused after an hour. Next day, her roommates are frantically calling me where she was. No idea. They were accusing me of some dirty deeds and threatening to call the police. Fortunately, after 2 days, she shows up. Apparently she met an ex (in the same building) and decided to stay with him."
"Above everything else:  Plan. 

Plan your next move at work, your next job, your savings, your retirement.  Plan to keep yourself in shape, plan to keep your friends in the loop, plan to keep your family close. Plan a vacation or just an afternoon off.

Two of my GF's siblings just turned 18 and the advice I've tried to give them is along these lines:  adulthood is awesome, but you have to realize that it is what you make it.  Nobody is forcing you to go to school or work, nobody is forcing you into the next job at work like you move through semesters at school.  Make sure you're reaching out to people you care about. People get caught up in dreams, but I'd like you to consider a different adage:  luck is preparation meeting opportunity. It's very very rare that happenstance gets you where you want. 

I chose the state university I attended because it was cost advantageous to me over a private school.  I chose my original menial job with this company over a different menial job because of the opportunities it offered in the long term.  I choose to live below my means currently because it allows me to make bigger plans in the future.  I absolutely still have fun, but not often lavishly or impulsively.  I have gotten many comments over the years that my life seems easy and it is, but it's because I've made the right choices and planned ahead. 

It's your life.  Make sure you're the one in the driver's seat. "

Baby talk. Once was with a girl who thought she was being cute doing this while in the throws of passion. Didn’t go over well when I stopped and looked at her with a WTF look on my face. 
"When I'm single and lonelier than usual + my friends are down to go to a strip club for some special reason then I go. It's mildly satisfying to have women approach me instead of the other way around. I've been in several relationships but 0% of them were from a woman instigating. It just feels so nice (even if it's ""fake"") to have a woman approach me to offer a dance or to sit and chat. Even better when she's naked. "
"The other night the girl in the front seat of our Uber Pool was trying to talk to the driver about the trip to Florida she was about to leave for...she was clearly excited about it but the driver was kind of just ignoring her. So I chimed in and had the most innocent 2 minute conversation with her about the weather in Florida and the impending snowstorm where we were. My girlfriend was upset because apparently me talking to a girl about the weather could be misconstrued as flirting. 

She later clarified she wasn’t mad because she thought I was flirting at thay instance...but because in the future some other woman could interpret talking about thr weather as flirting"

"Dude, you don't go around ""looking for a girlfriend"". If a girl doesn't feel that she saved you from drowning in a never-ending stream of pussy with her awesome unique personality, she feels that she pulled you from a bargain bin. Even if you're on a dry spell that spans multiple presidencies, you need to act like you're very reluctant to settle down due to all those enticing opportunities you have, because if a woman starts to suspect that nobody else wanted you, she starts wondering why should she.  "
"We cannot read your mind, you have to tell us what's wrong."
"Oh boy, 

She (privately) called a girl a slut for wearing a short dress. I said it was hot out and really the dress was not that short. Since I defended her I obviously loved her.

We saw an R-rated movie in the theater, apparently I ogled some tits on-screen during the 3 seconds they were there. 

While driving through a parking lot, a girl smiled at us (me apparently) and because I smiled back, I loved her. 

There's more, but worst:

My attractive girl cousin died, so my gf came along to the funeral. The night before, she saw a picture of the cousin, accused me of acting weird (grieving maybe) and having been sexually attracted to her, and then lying to her about it.

It's kind of the same 'pleasure' you get from giving a girl oral - apart from being fun, seeing/feeling a girl reacting to your mouth by squirming, moaning, grabbing your hair with her hands and squeezing you with her thighs when she cums are all VERY hot and very fun.

In both cases, hygiene/appropriate grooming is obviously very important.  "

"Adding to this, you're probably depressed and don't realize it and when you finally get out of it, you've lost years of your life while you were on standby. You haven't grown as a person, you haven't grown financially, all you've done is stagnate.

""No, I don't like my belly you know that!""

""Well I like it, doesn't that make a difference?""

""No, I don't even want to think about it.""

"Just wanted to throw this out there. I had the urge to tell my ex this in the heat of the moment, but never did because I was aware he was average sized and afraid of a feeling/reaction like this. For me and I think for many women it's an emotive thing. As a sex characteristic a penis is much more prominent and daunting than the vagina. If the man gets aroused it gets big, sometimes exceptionally big compared to his normal. It would've been an expression of awe at the sight of his need, of feeling at his mercy. 

I've had plenty of men tell me how cute and small my hands were - I have big hands for a woman, but they are dainty and slim compared to male hands. And when they told me that they were in part expressing a feeling of tenderness/protectiveness and not comparing me to statistics of average hand sizes.

I wasn't there for your memories so this might not apply at all. But I resent that blurting out a dick is big has gotten such porny, quantitative connotations. "

My current SO on the other hand is really intelligent. It's amazing what she can come up with. She always has insightful opinions on things. We get along great because we can both voice our thoughts well.   It feels like more of a partnership than some sort of competition.  She's pretty great."

"I mean, a lot of dudes don’t even go down on women, so there is that. There’s usually an imbalance when it comes to giving blowjobs versus getting eaten out. It doesn’t necessarily have to be quid pro quo but when you’re receiving little but expected to give every time (enthusiastically at that), it’s a bit of a mood killer.

"About 5.5 years ago, I got out of a 5-year relationship. Was sad for a couple weeks, then committed to self-improvement. Lost some weight, found happiness and some new routines and then started online dating. I had decent success, wound up in a few-month relationship and then ended it and decided to just not worry about dating over the holidays. Ended up meeting a girl while volunteering, who I was initially just friends with. 4 years later, we're engaged and have a wedding date set for next year. "

"It's done wonders for me. I decided to focus on losing weight, getting a better handle on my finances, spending more time with my friends, and organising fun events. In the last 6 months I've lost 15.4 kg (~34 lbs), I've got savings for the first time in my life, I organised a holiday with 9 friends, and I spend more time with them on a regular basis. I just asked a girl out yesterday and she didn't hesitate to say yes - this is a girl I've known for a while but always thought was *way* out of my league.

Thing is, if you focus on making yourself happy and improving your life, girls notice these things. You'll feel better and look better, you'll come off as more confident and happier, etc. Once someone *does* come along, and eventually they will, you'll have plenty to talk about too. It's seriously a win/win.

Most people have a slight obsession with being in a relationship - they tie relationship status to their self worth. It's something that society encourages (because it must, or else the species would die out) but you need to look past that and remind yourself that being happier and improving your life will make you more desirable to others around you."

Just doing it is ideal. You don't have to be super suave about it. Most guys very rarely get hit on so expressions of interest are well received even if you're clearly nervous or having a bit of trouble finding the right words. 
I knew a kid in HS that was into ball stomping. He had a creepy infatuation with the girl I was dating and would make up stories about how she would ball stomp or kick him in the nuts in the locker room.
Junior prom. My mom's friend had a daughter around my age so they decided to hook us up. She was my gf so we planned to go to my prom. A couple weeks before prom she ghosts me. Doesn't answer texts or calls. A few days later she calls to break up with me but says she'll still go to prom with me. I figure sure why not. We go to prom and everything's pretty normal. We're in the middle of dancing and all of a sudden she leaves the dance floor and goes to the table. I ask her what's wrong and she doesn't say anything. Basically unresponsive for the rest of the night. I figured something must've been wrong since she didn't eat and muted herself suddenly. I drop her off home and go back to my house like wtf. A couple of days later my mom gets a call from her friend (my ex's mom). Come to find out she got raped and became pregnant and got an abortion a day or two before my prom. Which explained all the weird stuff but I was still super sad/enraged about it for a while.

"[This](https://vimeo.com/188418265) is the best advice I have ever seen for handling the seemingly endless monotonous grind. 

Really you need to rethink the way you view every second of your life. 

Think about this sentence

&gt;  I just feel like after I get back from the gym I have zero time to relax or enjoy myself. It's get ready for tomorrow, which involves meal prep, and setting out clothes and everything else that comes with prepping for the next day.

You don't relax and enjoy yourself at the gym? You don't enjoy cooking and creating your meals? 

I love the gym, it's a very relaxing way for me to wind down after work. Cooking is a chance to slow down and savor my sense of sight and smell and taste. It's hard, but just try focusing on every moment and enjoying it for the special moment that it is. Whether you're at work or the gym or cooking or whatever. Savor that perfect delicious moment and then savor the next one. That's all life is"

So glad you're not as big as my last boyfriend.

"Sounds like he needs someone to talk to.  Hang out with him, buy him a beer, and let him talk for a while.  Next time he starts blathering on via text, just say ""hey - save it for our next meetup or we'll have nothing to talk about""."
"I've had two.

1) We'd been on a date to a movie previously, so this was our second date.  I suggested we get some wine/beer and go to a local makeout spot.  This was in high school, we'd been flirting at school, so this suggestion didn't seem too forward.  Also, I'd said it like that - want to go to a makeout spot?  So there we are. The moon was bright.  Radio softly playing tunes.  We'd each had a beer and were on our second.  Conversation was flowing.  Then the moment came.  The momentous silence.  She turned her face to me, eyes glowing in the moonlight.  I leaned in.  She put her entire hand on my face and pushed me backwards, and said, ""No.""  I didn't say anything, but my expression must've.  She friend-zoned me on the spot.  I drove her home.  That was that.

2) Called her up to see what she was doing, and she invited me to go to a bar where a sorta big deal band was playing.  At the bar, I noticed that she would disappear for a time longer than your average dump, a few times.  About the time I put that together, I noticed her sitting on the far wall on the other side of the bar (the bar proper was like an island in the middle of the place) with a guy.  When she came back, I asked if she were on a date with another guy at the same time.  She said yes, the 'splained that she already had that date set up when I called.  When I asked why she brought me along, she just shrugged.  I left with the dignity I had left, which at that moment was roughly equivalent to the backsplash left in each can of beer the day after a party. Later, one of her friends called me up and told me that her plan was string me along, but she wanted to date other guys at the same time, and intended to hide it with the ultimate goal of ending up with me after she'd sown some wild oats. I was going out the door to meet her when I got this call.  Sure enough, she hit me with a ""it's you I really want"" speech, but I knew it was bullshit due to the phone call.  So, I got the chance to use a line from a stand-up comedian I liked.  When she asked if we could still be friends, I responded with: no, let's just be enemies.  I packed up and moved to another city a week later."
"She actually enjoys sex with me, loves me, is concerned for my wellbeing... I mean, that's a first. "
She let's the dog into the room before hand knowing damn well.We're about to go to climax mountain. Nothing worse than the dog locking eyes with me while in action.

"I matched with this Mexican girl on Tinder. Mid-20s, tall, beautiful, witty, confident. She was in the United States on a work assignment. We meet at a nice, intimate bar one night for some wine. Conversation was a great combination of flirtatious and intelligent. I recall being impressed without well spoken she was. Anyway, we have a couple glasses of wine and decide to hit a nearby bar where they regularly have live music. It was a winter evening so we're walking down the street close to each other, holding hands, laughing. It didn't feel like a first date at all. We walk into the next bar, grabbed a table in the corner of the room where we could enjoy the music, but also talk without disturbing the musician. I walk up to the bar and order two drinks. The female bartender asks me for my ID and also my date's ID. Strange, but no big deal. I walk over to my date and ask her for her ID so I can show the bartender. My date looks at the bartender and asks if we can go somewhere else. At this point I'm really confused, but agree that we can leave. We walk out of the bar and I ask her what that was all about. It was there that my date showed me her ID to which I learned she was actually nineteen years old. It turns out the bartender had a previous run-in with her at a different bar not too long before that and recognized her. Being almost thirty at the time, I felt sick to my stomach and kind of perverted for what had just transpired. "

"I wouldn't worry about it either way. Enjoy your relationship for as long as you can, but don't put any long-term expectations on it. Maybe it'll last the rest of your lives, maybe it'll last the rest of this week. The right thing will happen.  "
One time my boyfriend bought a really terrible painting from a thrift store of a  naked woman. He thought it was artistic but I got jealous. I was 23 then. I’m 29 now and have matured. I look back now and cringe at myself.
"Well here's the thing, the engagement ring isn't for you, its for her.  You can read all the reports you want about how ""worthless"" diamonds might be but remember, this is the person you love more than anyone else in the world, the person who you might be willing to give your own life for so if this is something she values due to cultural norms and centuries of tradition, that's a good enough reason in my book to get a girl a diamond engagement ring.   


Now if *she* doesn't *want* a diamond engagement ring, that opens the door to whatever jewelry she may prefer instead.  Again, this is her gift and should therefore be given with the intentions of making her happy.  I think ""non-traditional"" engagement rings will become more and more common but it's her call. "

"Does a FWB count?

She had just gotten out of a relationship and told me she didn’t want anything serious. A month or so in my coworker told her I was cute, not knowing we were FWB. Saw her at the bar a couple nights later and she started yelling at me in the middle of the bar and said “and I will stab her because you are mine” before storming off."
"So, I match with this girl on Tinder, she's pretty good looking and I usually have a very poor response rate from girls because I only use Tinder for logistics (I absolutely hate, hate, hate spending hours on texting with girls beforehand. It's extremely time consuming and almost guarantees you will have less to talk on your actual date. Despite that, I'm also just that much better converser in real life) so I make it short and tell a comment about a mutual hobby and ask her out for Friday.



Much to my surprise, she agrees. So I forget about her for the whole week and just confirm about the date on Friday whether she still remembers about it. She confirms. I arrive before the time and wait for her, she texts that she's going to be late 20min or so. I'm okay with that, at that time she also asks ""how tall are you?"" which is weird for me. I really, reallllly hate women who have Tinder bios ala ""only 6ft above"" so I tell her that I'm 5'4 (i'm like 5'10) and she goes mute.



She arrives and is surprised that I'm not actually 5'4 and that she was seriously considering flaking because of that. We joke about it and kick it off well instantly. For the record, this must be the first time the girl actually looks better than on her pictures. She's great looking. 



I take her to a coffee-shisha-bar-lounge by the corner that I frequent often, mainly because I am unoriginal and very lazy. And I don't have a car and I'm a total cheapskate. 



And the date... It goes amazing. The conversation, we had so much in common, both with marketing and psychology backgrounds and interests, lot of common hobbies, gym and fitness etc. And in middle of the date she just spews out of nowhere ""honestly, you are reallllly smooth"" and I feel good about it. The date is going well, we have a few drinks and 3 hours went by sooo fast that I couldn't believe it. At one point I just tell her ""shut up, I can't focus"" and she's like ""wat?"" and then I just turn her chin towards me and give her a super small microkiss. She decided that she didn't like that tease and followed it up with a deep, sensational, long kiss in the public lounge in front of all the strangers. It honestly was the best kiss of my life. With quite probably the best date of my life as well.



At one point we tired of the lounge and she kind of hints we should just bail. I can't remember who proposed it but the next moment we take a taxi to her place. And she lives in this, dangerous and poor district, which is okay with me, because I come from poverty. 



We arrive at her's and I'm shocked. This whole night I've been paying for everything but turns out she is living in a luxurious apartment and owns a 2018-manufactured car. She's no bum.




We get some tequila (my kryptonite) and just have a great make up sessions and she iniatites to get us into a shower together and that was so amazing, it was truly a ""moment"" it was just... great. The water flowing on her body made me realize that not only she looks better than on her pictures, but she might be the first girl I've met who looks better naked than with, say, sexy bra and undies. 




And she drags me to the bedroom and this is where everything goes into complete shitter. I've had a bit too much tequila, can feel she's not into my tongue skills very much and wants to proceed with piv, which is uh, problematic, can't at first get it properly hard, then can't seem to keep it and when I finally do I come instantly. Then give it a try for the second round and same problem all over again. It's just... that bad. Neither is feeling it. It's just... brutally bad.




Well, it is what it is. We fall asleep and few moments later she wakes me up saying that I snore so badly that it's better if I just leave, 'cause she has a buzy day ahead of her. So, essentially I got kicked out.




Next day she messages me about some weird lie about her ex boyfriend for not wanting to meet up anymore. I leave it at that. This is just really heartbreaking that I met a perfect match personality wise but I was so bad at bed that she was willing to drop it all. Damn.

That its main goal is being publicized through social media. Live your life privately.
I feel the same way now while Im in college. Finding direction all of a sudden is so difficult and frustrating.
"Constantly. 

There is a girl with the most entrancing blue eyes that I see every day when I walk to work. I get excited knowing I'm even going to see her in the morning, and sometimes my mind wanders thinking about her during....other times.

I don't know her, I will never know her, I'm probably too old for her so definitely not going to ever even say ""hi"" to her, which is just as well because by now she must know how intently I look at her every day unintentionally so I would be lucky if she isn't creeped out by me completely already.

"These are strategies i've adopted to get more time;

* No commute - i live 3 minutes from work by car, 10 by bike and 35 min walking.
* Home gym - no commute to the gym, and i workout in my boxerbriefs and work t-shirt ( super casual place, i'm still an engineer )
* Maid - I absolutely could not survive without a maid.
* Meal prep on sundays - I cook one or two big batches of something i really like and eat only that for lunch and sometimes dinner. 
* PRESSURE COOKER - In 50 minutes you have a bolognese or chilli that tastes like it cooked forever. Just chop all the ingredients up roughly, set the timer and forget about it. I can now meal prep for a full week on a busy monday evening.
* Standardize your wardrobe - Every piece of clothing i own goes with every other piece i own, pretty much. Makes picking clothes very easy.
* Standardize your laundry - If it can't be washed with everything else i own, i don't buy it.
* Fuck folding socks and underwear - Buy patterned colorful socks OR unicolored socks and just find the pair in the morning when you need them.
* Housemates if single - Especially if you are good friends. Make your house a gathering place and you wont have to go out to socialize as much.
* Cut your cable subscription - Because seriously, do something better with what little time you have. 

But most of all just get used to it. C'est la vie, literally.

Edit: Also what /u/bigbadbyte said. Most of all what he said, actually... even though he linked a guy who killed himself it's entirely the way i live life. I LIKE the gym and i LOVE meal prep. Actually, i love my job too. It's not inherent though, i've made a choice to try to enjoy the things i do in my life. Sometimes that's impossible and that's when i cut those things out, automate them or contract them out. Choose to love your life.

Edit edit: Yup, for being a Swede i am not exactly poor. That being said having a maid come over every second week isn't *that* expensive when since it is tax deductible. Plus, i share it with my two housemates. I pay maybe 70 bucks a month for it."

Let's call her Molly. We got introduced at a party, intentional setup, but we were both divorced with kids, so it made sense.

"Taylor Swift picks a random nerd off a busy sidewalk because it's a publicity stunt she hasn't tried yet. She fucks my brains out and writes a song about it. This isn't a sexual thing. There is no good accounting themed music, and this is my best shot of getting some."
"Break out of your comfort zone. Sure, it's easy and no one will expect anything when you're there but it's inherently unfulfilling. Take risks. Work, save enough money, then travel. Move somewhere else. There's no such thing as being on ""auto-pilot"", you're simply stuck in your comfort zone. Some people become paralyzed by the idea of stepping out and facing the unknown and putting the ordered, easier life behind them. It's those same people who can break out of their comfort zones that bear scars of interesting stories, fail too many times to count and ultimately live a life worth living. At 25 you're just beginning the rest of your life. There are lots of older gents who would do anything to be put back in your situation. "
I think he's wondering where the enjoyment lies in tonguing someone's shit hole
"It's really a combination of several things.

-Yes, you can see naked women on the internet for free.  But there is something to be said for being in the actual physical presence of these women and being able to talk to and interact with them.

-For 99.9999% of men out there (ie those of us aren't who aren't ultra-famous actors, musicians, or athletes), we don't get to experience what it's like to have gorgeous women walk up to us and start flirting and acting like they are attracted to us.  Yes, it's fake at a strip club, but it still lets us live out the fantasy to some degree."
I love puppies. 
the fact they can grow a person inside of them 
"Aside from the obvious physical stuff, she actually teaches ***me*** things. I was always in the ""teaching"" position with my past relationships and never had someone that could challenge me intellectually or school me on a subject.

Her brain makes me hard. "
"I wouldn’t try to press it too much. Let him be if he wants space but at least try to organize a hang out with him just to keep his mind off the situation like a bar, video games, or a movie or something. He doesn’t deserve someone who cares about a little height difference anyway. I feel bad for him, give him a pat on the shoulder for me."
Leave. They're never worth your time.
"Oh man, it was relentless. I feel like a therapist would be able to tell me what is and isn't normal, but the two things I notice are:

I am always *always* suspicious. Of everyone. Anything that I feel like is being done solely for my benefit, you bet your *ass* I'm questioning it.

I let small shit roll off my back, but I'll go 0-100 when I feel like it's something that I can't walk away from."
"I mean, it was two months ago and it is obviously still bothering you. Whether or not you should feel a certain way, you should talk about it because you are just letting it grow. 

But to answer your question as not the person you asked, no, I don’t see an issue with that. "
"Exactly. I spent my youth staying at home and feeling sorry for myself about how I'm not good at social events.  But even though I'm a big introvert, I slowly realized that I would get better at being at social events if I stopped avoiding them all the time."
"This is definitely an overlooked comment. The fact that you walk into a place where the women approach you and make you feel ""attractive"" is worth more than the visuals alone. "
"How they can be turned on by a guy. Someone needs to tell them dudes are 100 percent gross, hairy elbow monsters. Logically, women should all be lesbians."
Inner-uritheran stimulation. 
"I live in a major city so maybe 20 times a day. They all fade away from my thoughts by the next day and are replaced with more. It's just a part of life, not to be taken very seriously."
DUDE FUCK YOU LISTEN TO ME I KNOW MORE THAN YOU 
"First time I ate my wife's ass her screaming orgasm was so loud I thought the neighbors were going to call the police.  

We've been together twenty years.  Aren't a lot of ""firsts"" left.  It's nice when you try something new and get those kinds of results.  "
There’s a fine line between making people feel accepted and making unhealthy people feel like they don’t need to change
"This mentality drives me nuts. I hate how much I see this nonsense on tv shows and in movies.   Depending on how bad it is, I won't watch them anymore because it bothers me that much. 

It's a partnership between two adults. Nobody should be ""the boss."""
"I think even for people who realistically know there's not 'soul mates' and stuff like that, it's hard for your first relationship to not just seem like the end all be all of love, like your only shot at true happiness. While I don't think it's totally settled by the second relationship, I think part of that fades. And I think it's a good thing. Part of that is also beginning to understand love is conditional, takes work, can fail; and that's ok, it's still great. Maybe not fully getting it, but starting to."

'I've been around the world,' he said,

With all the things I've learned.

He leaned in close, and what I heard  
I never shall forget.

'I'll tell you this,' he started slow,

"Be strong buddy, for both of you. Stick by her side and weather the storm; for smooth seas never made a skilled sailor. 

You’ll come out stronger, and help give her comfort. I can only hope someone will be there for me. For what it’s worth, you’re both in my thoughts. "

"Less so ""stopped looking"" and moreso ""gave up"", but I'm doing better in classes, my research is going fantastic, I've got a great group of friends who I see every day, and have a leadership role on the largest engineering organization on campus. So the crippling loneliness only hits when I'm at home by myself. As of right now my dating life is as non existent as it has always been, but I've given myself less and less time to think and focus on that and the profound sadness that stems from that and instead I am distracting myself by doing other things to further myself.

Giving up has been a great improvement in my life, 10/10."

"1. You will always feel normal to yourself. I'm 42, and I look in the mirror and think I look pretty much the same as always, it's just the general population that's looking younger and younger.

2. Did you ever have an old beat up car? You could drive it around, and 99% of the time, think it ran just fine. But then someone wants to borrow it, so you tell them the car is in great shape, but then you start thinking of what you have to remind them about. There's a window that won't roll down, no big deal. There's a rattling noise in the vent--ignore it. 2nd gear is sticky, you might need to add some brake fluid, one of the tires is always going flat, the bumper is dented, the left headlight points the wrong way... And after cataloguing all of the flaws, you realize the car does not in fact run fine, that it is actually in frighteningly poor shape. This is your body in middle age."

I never realized I was in love. It was like I woke up one morning and decided that I loved that girl. It wasn't that she was nice and caring. It wasn't that she wanted me as bad as I wanted her. It was that every morning I woke up she was next to me waiting for me to get up before she got out of bed. It was that every morning before she checked her phone she said good morning. It was that she would get me something from the kitchen without even asking what I wanted. She simply loved me like I loved her.

"I read the reason why it's so popular on reddit a while ago. It's something like that it's the easiest porn to make because it requires no props or accommodations for fetishes, and little scripting. It's just vanilla porn with some weak dialog and because it's so simple to make porn websites heavily push it. That's why ""step-mom finds step-daughter masturbating"" or ""step-mom teaches son how to fuck"" is always on the front page even though few specifically like that style porn

Edit: fixed the comment a bit "
"I think the key is to be confident in your decisions and choices in your life. Set goals for yourself and try to block out the outside voices and work towards achieving your goal. It doesn't matter what other people think, it only matters what you think. If you are content in your life, who gives a fuck that other people think you need to be a certain way. If they make comments that do get under your skin, be firm and tell them to (as politely as you can) fuck off. They shouldn't be talking about your personal life anyways unless you want to.

I get told constantly by female friends and people at work that I work out too much and work too much, but I am content in my life. I don't care what they think I should do, I have my own goals and I'm not gonna let them tell me what I should or shouldn't do. 

If it really gets to you, look at getting a new job. Getting a pet is also a good option too, especially a dog, they love you unconditionally.

Also, try not to dwell on what other people say, it's no use being spending your time angry. Find new hobbies that can occupy your time, maybe hit the gym if you don't already. You can also try taking a boxing class where you can let out your anger on a literal punching bag.

If all else fails, there is always therapy. It doesn't have to be a last resort either, you can talk with a professional about how are you feeling and they are there to help you. One of my friends sees a therapist and he says it does help him deal when he has bad days or weeks.

Anyways, that's my 2 cents."

"One of my friends from elementary, Greta, moved to my highschool. I had a girlfriend at the time and she was always a few pieces short of a full puzzle. Anyways I was texting my girlfriend and misspelled great as Greta. She flipped out and started asking how long I'd been dating my friend on the side, accessing me of all sorts of stuff when I literally had just started talking to her again. We fight and make up and everything's good for a bit.

Like 2 months later I start getting all these phone calls at random times and night and during the day and the person would always hang up. Finally I block the numbers and figured it was a friend fucking with me. So I tell my girlfriend at the time about it and she just though it was wierd and also blamed Greta. I shrugged it off. The next week she wanted me to use my phone to call a few friends (forgot why she couldn't use her's) she tells me none of the calls would go through. I thought that was kinda wierd so I take my phone and start checking the numbers she was calling. Every single number I'd blocked that would call me was one of her friends. Calling to see if there were girls voices in the background. Broke up with her right then and there once I put it all together. All of it starting over me misspelling great in a text message.

"ok.. im ~20 years older than you, so guess i can give some input.. two things:

passion follows success. it does NOT preceed it. what i mean- even if something sucks, but you are getting some interest in the market- DO IT! 

&gt;Live my normal life without thinking too much about this


you will not get anywhere. sorry. in my experience, big changes in my life came when I CONSCIOUSLY DECIDED to bring them in, and then worked for it. otherwise, it was just coasting from day-to-day, and then wondering in autumn years where life went...

"
"Independence and passion is so attractive. For example, a girl who knows what she wants and articulate what they want in a clear and concise manner is so attractive.

3 Things come to mind, but I'm neither a psychologist, nor a people-gist.

1) Find social interactions outside of work that aren't like those colleagues. I made the experience that I care way less about disapproval from many different social fronts when I have only a single group of people that accept me the way I am.

2) Get rid of those people (most straight forward, but also: Finding a new job is probably one of the harder options).

3) Tell your colleagues that you don't feel comfortable hearing about your personal live. Sometimes people use you as a emotional punching bag and need to be reminded that you even *can* get hurt if you don't show it enough."

BUT oh my god what I'd give to feel that way again... don't get me wrong, I LOVE my gf and we have a special bond only years of partnership and trust can build, but the puppy love phase was so fucking fun and naive. Just the thought of her touching your hand was enough to inspire lovely poetry. Everything about her was perfect and indestructible and you were so lucky to breathe the same air and you must make babies in her image immediately!!"
Speak for yourself
"Don't be discouraged. Most people who want to be monogamous only date one person at a time.

Remember there's an element of selection bias on Reddit. Stories that are interesting or unusual find their way to the top, and there is no way to verify anyone's claims, so there's a lot of incentive to lie about how awesome your life is. "
"Passion and interest in things that make it easy to connect with her. Not just being into things superficially because they make good conversation, but actually giving a fuck about eclectic stuff.

The main problem: Im being treated like an idiot because the producer thinks I cannot handle an unusual delivery or complex dialogues. 
I am a woman who also loves giving blow jobs. My husband usually gets 2-3 a week. Majority of the time he doesn’t ask for them I offer them. Because I enjoy that he enjoys it. Getting him off gets me off. If someone is going to complain about performing something like that then they shouldn’t do it all and they better find something else to be amazing at in bed. Sex should be fun from start to finish. 
"Acting like I'm just a dick. Girls seem to think that because men can orgasm easily they don't need foreplay/touched in other places.

"I was invited out for drinks this weekend by this cute girl. Then it struck 5 pm Saturday night and I got an essay of a message that started with "" I don't think it's a good idea for me to grab a drink with you because I need to focus on my career."" "
"Can confirm it was like this with my ex. I'm only slightly above average, but she was very tight and sometime we couldn't even have sex. 

You should still never say this regardless of the dude's size though. Reverse the genders and it would probably be like saying ""I'm so glad you're fatter than my last girlfriend."" Even if that's what you prefer, no one wants to hear that."

"I feel like men leave women no choice than to make up excuses. I've seen guys get super aggressive when a woman tells them that they're straight up not interested. The other night I had to help my female friend escape some guy she only kinda knew who followed us all the way home from the bars because he couldn't take a hint. And when he finally realized she didn't enjoy his presence, he still bugged her for like ten minutes to get her number before he left.

Excuses suck, but if guys didn't act so damn entitled we'd probably get more straight-forward responses."
First thing I do everyday. I'd feel like crap not showering in the morning.
"Some people may find this weird, but my boyfriend and I actually have separate sheets and blankets. If you looked at the bed, it would appear that the bed is cut in half. Neither one of us likes to be touched when we are sleeping, and we both have different sleep schedules, so it works well for us. I remember the day we discussed it and we’re both so amazed and relieved that we found someone who had the same sleep needs"
"I had already been on a couple of dates with this girl. She was cute, and was totally into me.

We ate at chipotle, and there was a guy sitting a couple of tables away from us and it sounded like he let out the HUGEST FART. I looked at the guy with a ""you just fart?"" look and he looked at me all clueless.

Well....the smell...came on over and I didn't want to say anything but my face was saying it all. It wasn't until I looked over and the girl was red with embarrassment and she quickly ""masked the smell"" by changing a subject that we where talking about.

I got over that small moment, but I saw it in her face she was bottled up with embarrassment and gas. She excused herself to the bathroom and I told her i'll wait and she just told me ""you should leave"" I stayed. So when I walked her to her car she gave me a side-hug and just drove off.

So I left, texted her if she was ok. We talked about a week more till I got that ""shes not interested"" vibe and just decided to tell her its not going to work.

So gas ruined my potential relationship.

I could be wrong but I would say you're probably not signalling sexual intention and giving off the cues that men take as permission to escalate things physically.
"Dude, you went through all of that. What was the breaking point?"
Been there done that... wife of 14 years ran off to Mexico with a bartender from Malibu “because  he understands me better” (they broke up already) and now I take care of two preteen daughters (8 and 10) a majority of the time while trying to balance my work because her work is “too busy” and she “has to” travel all the time... be careful what you wish for... or choose better than I did... phew...
"Came home one day to find my then GF drunk and screaming at me about someone named ""Tanya"" who had wished me happy birthday (along with love you, hope you're well, etc) on Facebook.  Before I could say anything, she threw a bottle of beer and my laptop at my head.

"There are two things my mom did that I always appreciated:

There's that stereotype that men are hopeless without women but my mom always held my female peers to higher scrutiny. That way I could see that girls are just as flawed as boys and that I was worth something in a relationship. You could always hold someone to too much scrutiny and that would be an issue but she struck a balance that helped keep my romantic interests a bit more grounded. 



She would also always ask me if I could pause my video games before she asked me to do something. That was a very small courtesy but it was appreciated during boss battles."

I had a damn panic attack my last week in because of the stress of that unknown future after having a blanket for so long, but I managed to convince myself it was the best thing for me and went ahead with my separation.

"I’ve never asked a girl out in my life, so I guess I have never been “actively” looking. I’ve been interested in a few but never asked them since I sensed they were not interested back.

Now in my early 30s, I have quite a bit of $$ in my bank account, two cars, a retirement account, excellent medical/dental. No house yet, but probably heading that way within a couple years. I’ll have a large down payment. I can easily afford to do pretty much anything I want - bought an X-box on a whim (although I hardly play it), have a gym and rock climbing membership, latest phone, sweet computer.

I’m currently in the best shape of my life, have a good friend group (mix of m-f), most of them don’t bug me about when I’m getting a gf. I play in various adult sports leagues and enjoy them quite a bit. I run 5k and 10k races for fun.

Not being tied down means that I can move whenever I want. I’m seriously considering moving out of state soon for career advancement.

I’ve definitely had times where I badly wished I had a gf, and I’ve had times where I thought I wanted a wife and kids. Not anymore. I mean, female companionship would be nice I think, but I don’t want marriage or kids anymore. Since I have money, I’m especially suspicious of what a girl would want from me. Brief stints on Tinder and Bumble taught me that the single moms **loved** me...probably because they saw “engineer” and thought $$$. These same girls that ignored me in my 20s. Hmmmm.

**TLDR** life is pretty good as a 30+ bachelor. I have had urges to get a gf, but I no longer want a wife or kids, so I’m definitely not looking. I had no luck with women in my 20s, but now they want my money. Nope."

"So true.  My brother and his wife do this very well. They are honest about how they feel about something and hash it out in a civilized way - sometimes it can get a bit tense but I've never seen them yelling at each other or anything.  They also deal with the issue immediately, instead of bottling things up and exploding later on. 

My grandparents would never have disagreements in front of their children: they would go into a private room to argue.  They thought it would upset people (mainly their children), I suppose, to see/hear them arguing.  I think that was probably my grandmother's personality of never wanting to upset people or burden them.  But I think that seeing them argue and then resolve issues would probably be a good thing for their children to see, as a model of a healthy relationship."

"I guess there was less pressure back then. I felt like eventually I'll meet a girl who likes me, so if I just talk to girls who interest me and flirt a little bit then one of them might like me back. No big deal, just try to enjoy yourself.

Now at 29 with no woman ever having acted the slightest bit interested in me, there's a kind of pressure that you can't shake. Now if I meet a girl and she seems nice and kinda cute, it's almost like *""Oh god is this the one? Is she going to be the first ever girl to show some interest in me? Will she smile and laugh when I flirt with her? I have to do it right. I can't fuck this up.""*

And I know people are gonna say to just relax and don't have the wrong attitude and change my mindset etc. etc. But really, none of you know what it's like to never be desired for three decades unless you've actually been there.

"This comment is absolutely spot on! Being confident in your choices is the best way to deal with people like this.

The reason people are giving you crap for your choices is because *they* are insecure in their own. You see this all the time with all sorts of things: drugs, dating, exercising, diet, you name it - you'll make a choice, and insecure people who made a different choice will make fun of you and try to bring you down.

This is because these people are insecure. They have bought into the idea that there exists a social hierarchy of ""coolness"" (or ""manliness"", or ""virtue"", or whatever other metric they feel they have the most of) and that doing or not doing certain things gets them more points to advance. So if they buy into the ""manliness"" metric, having a girlfriend is good because it makes them more manly, and therefore better than someone who doesn't have a girlfriend.

However, all of these metrics are subjective and are only worth whatever we collectively decide they are worth (kind of how a dollar doesn't have an intrinsic relationship to a bar of chocolate - one dollar will get you as much chocolate as we collectively decide it should). Societal opinions on the value of things change, and people who rely on their accumulated ""points"" to feel good about themselves are terrified of the things that make them ""cool"" (or ""manly"" or ""fit"" or ""woke""...) suddenly losing their value. They need the things they do/have to be *desirable*, which requires other people to want them too.

When you decide that you don't need a girlfriend, your co-workers have their ""coolness"" threatened because you, by not chasing after a girl, are devaluing theirs. When you tell your friends you're not drinking or doing drugs, you devalue the ""coolness"" of it, which makes it so they are less cool now. There are countless examples.

In order to bring the value back up, they need you to want the thing. They'll tease, goad, argue, plead, threaten, do whatever they think will work to try to get you to pursue the thing they already have. In order for it to have value, they need you to want it too.

In summary, people who are insecure measure the value of their choices by how much other people want the same thing. You not wanting it makes it less valuable, and this makes them upset because you're threatening their standing in the hierarchy.

Does it sound totally stupid? Yes, because it *is* stupid. Confident and secure people see the intrinsic value in their choices, and how other people feel about them doesn't change that value. They don't buy into imaginary social hierarchies, and don't think they are any worse or any better than other people who have made different choices. They are content with what they've chosen, or are making steps to improve themselves for themselves, not for made-up life points.

Do what makes you happy, OP. When other people give you crap for choices you made that don't affect them in the slightest, it's 100% not about you."

"The chasms of difference that are possible between what they say they want in a man, what they believe they should want in a man and what they *actually respond to* in a man.

Men don't have this kind of internal conflict. What we say we want, what society tells us we should want and what we actually do want are the same thing; a woman who's pretty and likeable with brains and character. For a lot of women it seems to be tangled knots of *""well he's got a great job and he's only a little shy, his looks could grow on me I guess but I think he'd be a great father and my mother will approve of him but he does drive an ugly car and I don't think Karen will get on with him but I think he'd support me in quitting work to have kids and I'm pretty sure he won't wait too long to propose but he has a dog and I want cats but we both like Chardonnay....""* What this means is that they marry a guy they never really fancied and then he goes on /r/sex to complain that the bj's dried up shortly after proposing and sex stopped altogether two years after the wedding.

It's not their fault and I can't blame the ones who end up like this. I think women are under far more scrutiny in their choice of partner and it means they're trying to please way too many people when picking someone to settle down with. Ladies, marry the man *you* like, not the one society approves of."

"I told my wife I loved her in under a month. We're still together almost 16 years later. It was true then, and it's truer than ever now.

It took me 4 months with my other partner, but I waited largely because I knew she'd had some weirdness with a previous partner where it all fell apart when they started expressing serious feelings for each other. I knew I loved her about a month in.

So to put it plainly, it would depend on the girl, and how I felt about her. But nothing about saying I love you quickly necessarily is a problem for me."

"Completely emptied my 401k to invest in real estate after the housing market collapsed.  Like $0 left in my account, paid a SHIT TON of tax, and literally ""bet it all"" on the rental market.

Had it failed, I'd be fucked for retirement for a few years.

How did it turn out?  I took $30k out of my account in 2011, and I've continually reinvested profits to the tune of $80k of ""my money"" in the rentals. Right in the middle of doing a cash out refinance, and pulling out $138k, all the while still maintaining 20% equity in all my rentals.  So, I'm literally ""playing with house money"" and got ""paid"" $58k to deal with the rental headaches.

In 2011, I had 1 rental.  I currently have 10, and I'm going to use the money to buy an apartment building, most likely a 10+ unit building.  Within 3 years if I continue this trend, I will have more than 40 units, making about $200-$350 per unit per month.  Which means I can retire by the age of 50."
