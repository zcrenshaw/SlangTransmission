"This one's pretty tame. My best friend's husband is pretty squeamish, so both times she gave birth she had me come to the delivery room along with him. During both deliveries she pooped while pushing. The midwives cleaned it up so fast she didn't even realize it had happened, but her husband and I were holding her legs so we saw.

She swears that she's so lucky because she didn't poop while delivering. She's a very self conscious person and I think she'd be mortified if she knew the truth. Her husband and I have never mentioned it. Its like this hilarious little secret."
"Nothing is ever your fault

You tend to want to discuss the problem more than your SO does (hint: only you see any problem)

You feel a deep and profound feeling of injustice if you don't get your way

You typically don't have any data to support your arguments, just ""gut feelings""

You feel like a compromise = you losing

Whenever there's a problem, it's because of something your SO ""always does"" or ""never does""

You find yourself lamenting on how there are never any good men/women

You hate ""drama"" and feel the need to tell others

You find yourself telling people about the type of person you are instead of showing it on reality. *""I'm the type of person that...""*

You are on bad terms with all of your exes

When you sense excitement building in the room you feel the need to drop a Debbie Downer comment so people don't stray too far from your emotional state (misery loves Co.)

Given a **little bit** of power - it tends to go to your head

You know exactly where the line is with people. This is important, so you know how much you can get away with"
"That my cousin is, in fact, my half sister.  She was born to my mom, but a different man than my father, and adopted by my mom's brother and his wife.  She looks just like my mom and sister, and knows she's adopted, so she may know and not just not talk about it."
"I was at work and there was an evelope on the floor in a common area. I opened it to see the name so I could give it to the owner (thinking it belonged to a patient). It was an approval for some HIV med coverage in our state and had the name of a coworker.  

I didn't know how to return it without her knowing I saw it. Nor did want to leave it out in case another person picked it up.  I placed it on a chair next to where I found it and just watched it like a hawk making sure no one grabbed it. At one point another coworker was in the area and I went and stood between him and the chair until he left.  Eventually the owner got it.  I never told anyone about it. 

Also, this was night shift so there weren't a lot of people around."
15 year old me wanted Legolas. 27 year old me wants Aragorn. 
"I’ve seen the sex tape my husband made with the girlfriend he had prior to dating me. 

I’d never ever tell him I’ve seen it. "
"I honestly really like the current youth.

You're as politically focused as the boomers were but without the selfishness. You have a lot of the cynicism of us Gen-x without the abject acceptance we suffered. And you have the drive to deliver a better world we did. IMO a good balance of the two.

Yes, there are a lot of the traits that mark every generation of youth - a bit too naive, a bit too simplistic, a bit too easily drawn to extremes - but with the starting point being as good as it is I think you guys will do OK. I just hope you guys understand your power and exercise it before it is too late."
Genuine kindness is the sexiest thing ever. Fuck misunderstood bad boys. (Or rather don‘t) 
"My dad admitted to me once that he doesn't think my older brother is his son. My older brother has admitted to me that he's not sure my dad is his father. I'd never, ever, tell either one of them what the other has said because it would devastate them. They've always had a rocky relationship and don't need any more doubts."
"I have no sexual attraction towards him, and there are parts of him I wouldn't want to see up-close in a relationship (not physical parts, parts of his personality)."
"Never tell her lol.

I’m pretty sure I did with my kid (honestly it’s almost inevitable) but I am blissfully ignorant of the facts for sure and would like to keep it that way. You’re a good friend. "
"You feel like you're walking on eggshells with what you say and do around them, just in case. 

You don't quite trust yourself anymore. You're not quite sure of your feelings, reactions, and version of events, even if you're not usually like that otherwise. 

You feel like no matter what argument or disagreement you have, you're the problem, the one at fault. You do everything you can to get back to the beginning of that relationship, thinking that if you could only be like that then they, too, will treat you as nicely as they did in that ""honeymoon phase"". "
"It made me feel like shit hahaha. 

He didn’t plan to have me see it, but he gave me an old Windows hard drive he couldn’t use anymore since I needed one for some backups and he’d swapped to Apple products a few years prior. I honestly believe he forgot it was on there, it was a bunch of old music files and tv episodes, but the thumbnail caught my eye. I thought it might be some porn he he stashed, and since at the time he was super shy about sharing what he was in to, my rationale was “oh porn he liked enough to save, I can see if there’s anything he super likes!”

Once I started watching I very quickly realized (obviously) who it was.  I know I should have turned it off...but it was one of those things where I couldn’t stop or look away. 

I’d had a bit of a complex about comparing myself to this girl, she was thin and fit and the epitome of “hot alt/goth girl” while I’ve always been a bit chubby and frumpy, and seeing this video definitely didn’t help my self esteem. 

That’s been years ago though and I’ve gotten past the negative feelings. Still would never tell him I’d seen it. "
What.
"Women rejecting men for being ""too nice."" "
"A good friend of mine in high school was gay.  So gay.  I didn't tell him I knew, but he did muster up to courage to tell me when he was drunk one night.  We drifted apart after high school because I moved around a lot.  I was in my hometown visiting my parents, and saw him.  I waved, but he didn't see me.  Bewildered, I kept peeking over at him, trying not to get caught.

He was wearing a wedding ring (this was before gay marriage was legal - I'm such an old whipper snapper) and on, what appeared to be, a date with a man.  His parents are super catholic and I knew right then what was going on.  J was still in the closet and on a date with a man, while married to a woman.

Two years later he committed suicide.  It haunts me that I didn't reach out to him.  I know what he was going through, because I was going through it, too.  I'm out now, but I really wish J would of had a chance to live life as his authentic self.  He was such a good person.  He was a really special guy and I miss him so much.

I never said anything to anyone, because it wasn't my place.  I hope J felt a little peace toward the end, at least."
"his quasi-hoarder tendencies. no motherfucker, you do NOT need to keep that plastic piece of shit you got from that Cisco conference in 1998."
"Yes.

There's just no romantic spark between us. I dunno, man, like... It's not like I dive vagina first onto anything with a dick as soon as we have a meaningful conversation."
"I'm not sure it counts because I was actually on my way to buy a pregnancy test, but as I walked in the drugstore the smell of all the perfumes was too much. I threw up on their welcome mat - no warning, I couldn't even turn my head. I felt ridiculous buying the test, the cashier was looking at me like, You really don't need to buy this. "
"The “War on Christmas” thing is the first thing that popped to my mind too. I have never once seen anyone take offence at “Merry Christmas.” 

Saying “happy holidays” is not erasing Christmas, it’s just A) an alternate thing to say, and B) refers to a season that may also include not only other faith holidays, but also New Year’s. 

Just say whatever you want, nobody cares, nobody is trying to take Christmas away from you. "
"I had no say in what happened to my hair up until I moved out of my parents house. Before puberty it was always cropped short and never got much longer than a bob cut. I always got scolded for wanting something else. Then after my first period I was *now a woman and had to look and act the part*, so I was no longer allowed to cut it. But they also didn't want me getting attention from boys so I was only allowed to wear it certain ways, I wasn't allowed to wear makeup, remove facial or bodily hair or wear clothes that fit properly. 

It didn't feel traumatized, I felt resentful. It wasn't about the hair or appearance, it was about having every single aspect of my life completely micromanaged and having preferences of my own treated as defiance, a sin and that needed to be stomped out. "
"I'm 72 and I joined reddit just to see what is up with the young people.  I find they are generally grounded, compassionate and certainly more independent than when I was young.They think more for themselves whereas in my day we were told what to think.  For instance I wanted to go to medical school.  It was hard for women to get into med school back in the 60's.  I was told that I should be a wife and mother.  A single parent back then was a scandal, Now it is the norm.  There is a real drive in the young people to see justice done right, save the world, be more conscientious towards others.  I really like young people and thoroughly enjoy reading about them,  even the grumpy ones.  lol"
"When my husband's uncle was murdered (during a robbery), we helped clean out his house. We found a closet full of Nazi stuff. Like scrapbooks, patches, and items that showed he was an actual Nazi. Not the German kind, but the scary American kind. We were horrified. We threw all of it in the dumpster and didn't tell anyone. He had no children, so nobody questioned that he had a closet full of junk. "
"This works because it's stuff we do and not just stuff I do. 

* Look for the good things he does and thank him for it.
* If he snaps at me because he's cranky, don't snap back - I address it with him later when he's over his mood if needed, but he always realises he's been a jerk and apologises first. 
* If he does something that annoys or upsets me, raise it rather than let it become a thing,  but only in private. 
* Don't criticise him in front of others. 
* Give him the space he needs. 
* Give him plenty of affection. 
* Don't turn him down for sex too often, and make sure I initiate sometimes. 
* Pull my weight around the house. 
* Be considerate and avoiding doing things that bug him. "
"I went on a first date with a guy off Tinder. We talked a little through text but we'd only been talking for a day or two. We met up and really clicked. I was really enjoying the conversation and when he asked if I wanted to go back to his apartment, I said yes without thinking about it but very quickly regretted my decision. I liked him but this was our very first date and I felt like I had rushed things and I wasn't sure at all if I actually wanted to sleep with this guy. I resigned myself to sleeping with him because I was in his house and like the girl from the story I didn't know how to get myself out of the situation.

&amp;nbsp; 

We made out some and took off each other's shirts, but he sensed something was wrong with me and asked if I wanted to wait until another night. I was so relieved and so grateful. We made out some more but ended up just snuggling and then grabbing a bite to eat. We ended up sleeping together several dates later and we were FWB for 10 months before things ended amicably. 

&amp;nbsp;

THIS is how it should be done. This is the purpose of asking for consent. I'm so grateful for this guy. By giving me an out when I needed one, I remember him as the great guy who didn't pressure me into sex rather than a guy I had awful sex with that one time. "
"It's simple really, you just insert one end of  a bendy straw into your hoo-hoo, and stick the other end through your zipper. 

Then you can walk around breathing easy👌"
"I'm married to the biggest dork who doesn't even think twice about being ""embarrassing"" and I find it HILARIOUS, seriously I snort-laugh!  Guys I was interested in in my teenage years were all douchebags that took themselves too seriously"
"My younger brother and I were adopted at birth, we aren't related. 

My mom was always very open about our adoptions and it's never been a big deal or anything, but she's not very close with my brother. They've never really gotten along. 

She and I were talking about his adoption one day, she was reminiscing and told me that a few years after we had adopted my brother, his birth parents got in contact with them and wanted them to adopt another baby of theirs. My parents declined.

My brother has a real brother out there, and he doesn't know it. I've never had the heart to tell him, because I don't want to give him another reason to be bitter towards my mom, but I'm not sure my parents will ever tell him either "
That was very nice of you to make sure no one else saw the letter 
"Not me but a woman I was talking to on the bus today, she was in her eighties, and in her twenties she found a tortoise just walking along, she couldn't find out who it belonged to and now she's had it for about sixty years. So she was saying she doesn't know how old the tortoise is, at least sixty years old because that's how long she's had it, but it could be nearer one hundred."
amazing answer.
"This one is kind of silly, but it's like a precious little secret to me. 

When my partner and I first started seeing each other, we were just banging. He made it clear at the time that he wasn't interested in anything else, and I didn't press it even though I was actually falling pretty hard for him. One time I was at his place and he asked if I minded putting some headphones on with loud music because he had a quick check-in call with his classmates in his healing class (kind of like an emotional group therapy thing). I of course didn't mind and started listening to music, but at some point between tracks my phone froze and I accidentally heard a snippet from his conversation.

""Oh, Anastasia? I uh... I dunno, there's something between us that I'm not used to. It's kind of scary but also it's pretty amazing to see her smiles after a couple days of being apart. I'd say that so far, things are challenging me to change my views about us."" 

And then my music picked back up. "
"I’m sorry :(

But if it makes you feel better, there’s a reason they aren’t together anymore, and you two are :) "
"Oh I can contribute here. 

We matched on tinder. I was bored and he was good looking and had good conversation skills. He asked me what I was studying and I said political science. He said ""I studied in that field and I'm quite involved politically in different projects, wanna grab a beer and talk""? Sure!! 


So we meet. He talked for an hour non stop. But what he meant when he said that he studied was that he smoked pot all day while looking at shady conspiracy websites. The whole thing. The holocaust never happened, it's Israel propaganda. Reptilians. Illuminati and rothschild, chemtrails, Beyoncé, Obama, blablabla. He wouldn't shut up. Anything I tried to say, he dismissed because school brainwashed me and I was a sheep. 


He got really animated at some point and I had a hunch that it could end badly. I said I was going to the bathroom and gave money to the barman, asked him to not let him follow me if he noticed I left the bar. 

That was one of the worse. 


Another one was a guy online too. Good looking young asian man turned out to be like 70. He had no hair and wrinkles. He was REALLY old. He saw me, said ""I thought you'd be slimmer "" and kind of left. I think this is the funniest thing that ever happened to me"
"&gt; My dad admitted to me once that he doesn't think my older brother is his son. My older brother has admitted to me that he's not sure my dad is his father.

He may not be his father but he can still be his daddy. "
someone ''boring''. basically all character traits that would actually make a good spouse. it had to be exciting and head-fuckery for it to be love!
Hope the other person is braver than me and initiates contact

I found out that a friend's grandma is a prostitute.
"Being a raging workaholic. He’s in finance and also has a side gig, even though we don’t need the money. He’s just addicted to working.

People ask me all the time how I cope, but I really enjoy my own time and company, so it’s not that much of a problem. "
"Emotional stability.  I used to find guys who had depression issues or addiction issues very intriguing and attractive because being in relationships with them had such a heightened sense of drama and I equated that rush with love.  I continued to seek out those men until about age 25.  Now at 30, I find men who are calm and healthy to be incredibly attractive.  I'm very grateful I changed my preference, especially now that I'm at the point where marriage is on the table."
"She was a girlfriend. You're the wife. He liked it so he put a ring on it. :)

Plus, the sex tape meant so little to him that he forgot about it and trusts you so much he'd let you use an old hard drive where something embarrassing might have been on it and he wasn't worried.

I know that can be turned around to seem careless on his part, but without actually being in your relationship, I read it as him trusting you and not thinking about this prior girlfriend or that sex tape at all."
"As a 14 year old girl, it would have been devastating.  I know a guy whose mother would purposely overfeed him and his brother so they'd be ""too fat to love""(Her actual words) and wouldn't leave her.

With that kind of abuse it's not really about the act itself.  It's the message that the act conveys which is ""You do not control your body.  I control your body."""

"I’m not OLDER, but damn kids these days are amazing at makeup/hair.  The number of times I look up some makeup technique and it’s a 14 yo with perfect everything is...humbling."
Mine has asthma. It’s like Darth Vader in my undies.
"I've had many in my life.

Applicable reasons include:

* Lack of physical attraction on my part.
* Lack of physical attraction on their part.
* One or both of us already being taken.
* Lack of compatibility romantically/sexually.
* Knowledge of our personality traits that make us incompatible.
* Lack of action by either of us.

I'm bisexual, so the above also applies to women, with the added reason ""She's straight""."
"My grandma has/had? a brother. I only know because my mom let me read a report from a psychologist about her and it mentioned that she'd been molested by an uncle. My family has gone 20++ years not mentioning him. I'm not even sure if he's stil alive? In jail? No idea. I'll never tell my grandma that I know, she'd be crushed. "
"When I was 13 I was looking through my mom's hope chest and I came across a diary of hers. Since I was a curious little shit, I read some if it and found out that she had an abortion when I was 3. I've never judged her for it or anything, but I'm 31 now and she still hasn't told me. I don't want to tell her that I know about it since invaded her privacy. She may never bring it up."
Guys getting yelled at for holding the door open. 
"I was a pretty heavy drug addict coming off of Heroin. My period was late but also I was dangerously skinny so i chalked it up to that. Well, i thought I was withdrawing really bad puking for days. found out i was pregnant, brokedown and told my mom everything and quit cold turkey. that was in 2014 so im happy to say ive been sober since then.

"""Nooo guys I just signed up for the racism! Tone down the sexism please :)"""
Lol upvote for the edit.
"I make sure my husband eats well. Before he met me he ate garbage all the time. 


I take care of a lot of emotional labour. 


I plan things because he isn't good at it and is causes him stress to try. 


When he is exhausted from working out too much I give him full body massages. 


I buy him little pick me up presents and when I have time off I like to clean his work equipment for him because it takes a long time


When he has a particularly bad day I know he doesn't want to talk, but he wants to hear me talk. So I'll find something to talk about for a few hours to make him happy. 


I record me reading Star Trek books for him for when he goes on deployment because it's hard for him to sleep.


I also love to buy him games on steam when he wants them but doesn't want to waste money. 


I also always have a restaurant of choice picked out for when he asks where I want to eat. "
Probably going to be an unpopular opinion here: I'm really happy for them but I also get envious and feel kind of left behind as I'm nowhere near that stage. 
"When I first found out I was pregnant my dog wouldn't leave me alone. Ever. Like she was glued to me. It drove me nuts and when I found out I was pregnant it explained it.

Recently a friend who's been trying to get pregnant started complaining about her dog never leaving her alone and being really annoying. Sure enough, she's pregnant."
"I've had my hair colored against my will when I was 15. My ex stepmother didn't like my black hair, she said I looked too goth and would constantly rag on me about it. I finally agreed to have it lightened to dark brown just to get her off my back. So she set us up a 'girls day' where we got our hair and nails done. I told the hairdresser that I wanted dark brown. When he took the towel off my hair was blonde. Like an ugly yellow blonde. I was shocked and just crying. It looked awful and was not what I wanted at all. He just took payment from her and left the room. She knew him personally so I'm assuming they talked about it in advance. It was really messed up and all trust I had in her was gone. 

She made a lot of comments like 'Oh, you don't look like Dracula anymore! You don't look like that Manson guy anymore!' She also went through my clothes the next day and threw out anything 'satanic.' "
"This was when I was 20 and questioning my sexuality (ended up not being gay - girls are just attractive but I'm not as sexually attracted to them as I thought). Anywho the date was with a girl which was awkward enough because it was my first date with a not-guy. 

I think we met on tinder? She seemed super cool. But as the date goes on she starts telling me about her HUSBAND and CHILD and then mentions she just found out she's pregnant again, but she was having issues with the husband and wanted to leave him. 

I was like fuck everything about this entire situation and could barely make eye contact with her the rest of the dinner. "
"He said, in passing, that if his 10 month old son were to drop dead tomorrow, ""it would honestly be such a financial blessing."" and then tells me what his income *could be* if he didn't have to pay a percentage in child support.
(OK I understand you don't have much of a connection with your baby due to failed relationship, but this comment was very...non human)

He said, in passing, that his 4 year old son turned out perfect and will end up just like him.

He said, in passing, that his goal when he is an old man is to move to Iceland because apparently they don't have the same child support laws as here? Goal is to end up with a bunch of young chicks he can ""use- exactly for what they are"" 
Justified it by saying ""Well the girls won't be wirh me for my looks now will they?""

He said that it is not my business to ask when the last time he got tested was.

He said my responses to all of the above *disappointed him* and he *expected much better* from me.

Although I was drunk, I just left. Found my way home from other side of town. He did not offer to drive me home but i prob would not have accepted."
"Being really busy. I do think some people thrive with busy lifestyles, but there's also a glorification of being busy/overworked. Also, some ""busy"" people aren't truly productive, they're more doing a lot of busy work."
"You just need to wear breathable fabrics like cotton. And if you wear tight pants all day, make sure your jammies are loose. "
Found out my sister was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder when she was a teenager (in the 80s). I only found out about 4 yrs ago - was helping our parents clean and paint their garage and found the papers by accident. I don’t think anyone ever told my sister about her diagnosis. 
"Someone being offended by saying “merry Christmas “ to them

Now I’ve had plenty of people get pissy when I say “happy holidays “

There are people who are interested in WWII history who might have a closet full of German Nazi stuff for innocent reasons. There’s no reason to have American Nazi stuff in your closet unless you’re a Nazi. 
"Someone who holds space for me emotionally. As a teenager I had a lot of internalized misogyny and low self esteem and I was always striving to be “cooler” and more “chill” and impress guys (i.e. never have any inconvenient feelings ever). 

As an adult I find it really unattractive to date men who treat my anxious or sad emotions as bothersome or make me feel pressured to get over it. Now I have strong enough self esteem to pity them instead of me. "
"I'm pretty old by reddit standards: 39. I think 'youths' today are pretty rock solid amazing.

* You call out wrongs more often than we did.
* You stand up to authority when necessary. 
* You mobilize, you're organized. 
* You're so good at living your lives in an era where everything is public and your past is never forgotten.
* You do so much with grace under more pressure than I ever faced growing up. 
* You more attuned to your own needs and wants and know how to say 'no' (most, and I pray the rest will find their voice). 
* You are earnest and lack the cynicism of my xennial peers. 
* You're globally minded. 
* You're more feminist than I was at your age. 
* You're interested in truth.
* You're not bound by structures over sexuality. It's beautiful to watch true acceptance in a generation.
* You're WOKE AF.

 I love you all."
"I’ve told this story before, so here it is again. I had been on the pill for many years, and we were definitely not intentionally trying to get pregnant. I suddenly really wanted a frosty from Wendy’s. We never eat fast food and are generally relatively healthy, so this was odd. I REALLY wanted one and made my SO drive me to the closest Wendy’s (about 20min away) at midnight on a Saturday. I even said something like “You know I’m totally gonna make you do this when I’m pregnant”. Turns out I was pregnant so there you go, haha. "
I love that they are focused on mental health as much as physical health. That being healthy in general is cooler than what we had. I grew up with the anorexic look being cool. Instead girls are focused on how strong they are. Smoking was cool. Now it's an anomaly. Girls and women are pro team girl these days. My husband's cousin is a shining example of this. We both believe a woman's worth is not in her virtue but her contribution. I was ridiculed for this view at her age (97).
"My brother-in-law (in his 30’s) has always had problems holding down a job so he often sleeps on a friend’s couch.  He lived with his dad and his dad’s new wife in her house for a year, but his angry outbursts got so bad that she kicked him out.  She doesn’t know that the new shed her husband had built is actually housing his son.  He’s been living in it for years and his dad brings him food and he even has a cat.  He has a space heater in there and every winter their electric bill goes up.  My father-in-law tells her that it’s due to her Christmas baking.  Sometimes she gets suspicious but she hasn’t pieced it all together yet."
Witty banter.
"I’m ALWAYS smiling and laughing when with people 1-1 which can come across as flirty to those who don’t know me or from an outsider perspective. 

When I’m genuinely attracted to someone I get really shy and nervous around them... and refrain from eye contact, lol. Sometimes I’ll have nervous laughter which either seems excessive or forced then I go home and hate myself a little for the overanalyzed interaction, lol"
"Groceries!  My partner got a job in October so we are finally able to afford groceries.  Before that it was just me working and I make enough to pay the bills but not buy groceries.   So we went to the food bank for a long time.

It's so nice to go to the grocery store and be able to buy anything you want, lol.  "
"*We matched on tinder.  She was good looking and had good conversation skills.  I asked her what she was studying and she said political science, which was cool because I pretty much have a PhD in the subject.  And the best part is that I didn't have to go through all the brainwashing academic bullshit to get it.  But I digress.  


So we meet.  I figure this is my chance to right some of the failures of traditional education (and maybe score some), so I share my research.  I'm on a roll, she seems interested.  She tried to interrupt a few times, but I anticipated her resistance and tried to gently break the news that she had wasted thousands in tuition.  


I was just moments away from tying everything together with my meta-thesis when she abruptly left for the bathroom.  After a couple of minutes, I saw her heading outside for some fresh air.  I understand, it can be overwhelming when you realize that everything you've been taught is a lie.  As I stood up, the barman bumps a glass with his elbow and spills an entire beer in my lap!  When I regained my composure, she was gone.   



So yeah, that's basically the story of how my date was kidnapped by the illuminati.*     "

I live in Alaska and my day to day legwear choice is just leggings which are plenty breathable. If I'm skiing or ice climbing then I usually strip off in the car to my base layer on the way home so I can warm up faster so I guess my vagina airs then? I also tend to have a shower after outdoor activities as soon as I get home to both heat up and clean myself up. I never sweat so hard as when I'm skinning up a mountain! Even if I'm doing it in my long johns.
"I'd say a big part of it is emotional manipulation. I've caught myself using it unintentionally and it feels pretty awful, even though I didn't realize what was going on.

for example, ""acting"" in a certain way or saying certain things to make someone feel something that you want them to feel, like crying so someone will comfort you instead of calling you out on something. or using carefully crafted words to derail a conversation into semantics. "

She told me and we vowed never to tell bob that his dad who is married with children and very active in the church was a regular at her strip club. He has a specific girl that he gets private dances from once a week. I’ve spent the night at his house so many times, and he’s “all about his family” and “all about god and the church”. Would have never in a million years imagined he’d have a secret like that. I wonder if bob will ever find out. "
"Doesn't care about food at all. He has preferences, yes, but is mostly an ""eat to live"" kinda guy. Also, due to his upbringing, he is a bit overwhelmed by the food store in general so I do all the shopping. He wouldn't likely suggest a dinner out for a date, too

I find this to be a wonderful thing that we share, and it's rare, but most people would find a disinterest in food to be a hindrance"
"I felt like a pretty tolerant person in this thread until your third one, specifically, the hiking part. I think it's SO RUDE for people to play music out loud on hikes.

"Pretty sure my dad is gay or bisexual. I went on his phone whilst he was driving a few months back (for some odd reason) and he had grindr open. I closed it instantly because he was next to me but I also think it's because I didn't want to believe it. Spent the whole journey bewildered, completely dazed whilst he spoke to me. He's married to my mother and I think they have sex occasionally but I have no idea if my mother knows. I don't whether she should know, my sister doesn't know either. I doubt anyone else in our extended family knows (like my grandparents, uncles... etc).

My dad has never suggested in any way that he is gay, maybe he's not fuck idk. Wouldn't explain why he has grindr. Either way, something I've never told anyone and will never bring up. "
"Good financial sense. It just wasn’t on my radar at 15. But now I’m making a good income, have my shit together, budget accordingly, have a great credit score, and the last thing I want to do is take on some guy’s extensive debt or poor spending habits. "
"My partner is all encompassing. Hands everywhere, laced through my hair, in the small of my back, running down my thighs. I'm so completely engulfed by him when he's inside me I can barely think straight. "
"I'm not ""old,"" but today's youth are a lot more tolerant and have a more justice-oriented mindset.  I saw it changing even within my own childhood.  When I was a freshman in high school, no one would even admit to being ok with gay marriage.  By the time I was a senior, open support was a thing and a small number (very small) had come out.  Nowadays, it seems like even in middle school, kids are aware of LGBT issues and generally supportive of them.  Kids aren't as afraid to come out as gay or trans.

Kids are also way more fashionable nowadays.  I'm not sure I actually consider this a good thing (you're supposed to look awkward and ridiculous when you're 15, dammit), but they probably will when they look back at old photos."
"I related to a lot of parts of that story. 

The amount of times I've taken on the emotional workload of men I hardly know, just to give them ""the benefit of the doubt"", is exhausting to think about. Many men, regardless of age, put the onus on the women to initiate closeness or vulnerability. It resonated with me in particular that the dude from *Cat Person* would leave her hanging in texts, despite later claiming he missed her when she went away, but how that ""missing her"" almost exclusively consisted of an imaginary ownership that she got no say in. 

I've had a dozen sexual encounters with men that would rather roleplay a shitty faux-porno complete with awkward dirty talk and a limp dick than figure out what I'm into. I've had to talk myself into getting turned on because I felt too uncomfortable to leave, or say no - it's not the same as feeling pressured, because it comes from decades of socialization to be ""nice"", to not rock the boat, to make sure everything goes smoothly as a woman. 

I've had so many bad kisses, so many clueless men who don't care about what's going on in my head, or my sexual pleasure, so many awkward dates, I'm drained. As I get older I find myself compromising more in certain areas and less in others - I have no problem calling a cab from a guy's bedroom, not anymore; however, I'm more likely to accept immaturity in LTR's and try not to take it personally when I'm never asked (not **really**) about my inner world. 

I'm glad someone wrote it, and I'm glad it was Kristen Roupenian, because it's a story that seems to be resonating with a lot of women. I hope some men read it too, and maybe see themselves in the guy, and develop a brief understanding of the ""double edged sword that is empathy"", as the author said later in an interview."
"Met a guy at work who asked me out. He picked me up and told me we were going out with his friends to a hockey game. Um, group date? Okkk. On the train they're taking shots from a flask and I knew this was going to be interesting. We get to our seats and they all ask me to buy them drinks bc I'm the only one over 21. What?!! I tell them no and they don't like that. One of his friends cornered me in the women's bathroom and tried to kiss me. My guy is completely wasted. He gets into a fight (actual punches thrown) with a man near us bc drunkness, who proceeds to throw my date over the top of the seats. Thank goodness no one was sitting there. He falls a few rows forward. We get kicked out of the game! We take the train back and he tells me that for whatever reason he can't bring me back home but not to worry, guy who tried to make out with me can bring me home. Yay. So the whole ride home his friend is hitting on me while I weigh my options of rolling out of a moving vehicle or not. Would not recommend. "

"So, I think it just has to do with conversation and being interested. Or just talking.

One time I was sitting down at a public space, saw someone I thought was attractive sitting alone, and just went up, introduced myself, asked him a few questions about himself, and then told him id like to get to know him more and gave him my number. 

I think its easier to be introduced, though. That way you could have more things to talk about. 

Otherwise, I find that the more eye contact i give the more interested they get. And I like to tease too. Not to the point where its hurting, just to get them to loosen up a bit and be playful. 

That's just me though. I'm not good at it by any means, its just something I've noticed that i do."
"I would just make sure its not an ongoing thing, and he's not left alone around young children in the family........."
Found out that my best friend cheated on his wife and had a child with his mistress. No one is his family knows about his bastard child although his wife does and they have worked many years to move past the damage in their marriage. Eventually I told him I knew about the kid and he said it was so releiving having a close friend share in the baggage.
She's probably made peace with it and doesn't want to burden anyone else with the knowledge. I doubt it was an easy decision.  Probably best to not bring it up.

"My hair was kept the same length as my brothers (2 inches maximum?) all throughout childhood, about ages 4-11. My father was the only adult in my life, and he did not want to take the time or energy to properly take care of a young girls hair, so he kept it very short. I cried at every hair cut. I was constantly asked/mistaken/bullied for being a boy. Some bigot even cursed my babysitter out for letting a young boy crossdress in public at a school function (outdoor carnival), after that day i stopped wearing girly clothes and pretty much only dressed in my brothers hand-me-downs to keep a low profile. It was traumatizing in so many ways, some I’m sure I haven’t uncovered yet (it’s been 15 years since I was allowed to start growing my hair). 

I have an emotional attachment to my now very long hair—especially after a mindless incident when I was 16 grown my hair out longer than I ever could’ve imagined, I was again forced to cut it very short against my will but out of necessity this time (copious amounts of latex paint + very thick long hair + time to dry and harden = haircut flashback nightmare of my childhood, because being 16 isn’t hard enough already). Talk about jarring flashbacks, it was two weeks before 10th grade started, and on the first day of school the boy I had been talking to and had a crush on all summer literally told me I was ugly with short hair and I could talk to him after it grew back. Devastating. All my childhood fears of rejection and loneliness had come to fruition. 

Even now as an adult I can’t bring myself to cut my hair on a regular basis even though I’m an awful at maintaining/taking care of because it wasn’t something instilled in me as I grew up. I’m pretty bad at all things feminine, and don’t even like to try a lot of beauty related things because I am automatically uncomfortable putting most makeup, dresses, or even dressy blouses on. I won’t wear heels or lipstick. I don’t believe anyone when they tell me I’m pretty. 

Even with whatever residual effects it might’ve had on my psyche, I can and do joke about how when I was a kid I was a cross dressing little boy. I have a picture of me 7/8 years old with my short hair, and an extremely flowery blouse. If you cover my shirt you can see exactly why everyone thought I was a boy. I’ll post the picture if anyone is interested in seeing it! "

Thing is, the daughter in this situation has no idea, and her and I are childhood friends (I'm twenty six now), and I haven't said a word because I promised that I would never tell her because it would probably hurt her too much.

"I feel like I felt different parts of that story in different dudes that I've dated, specifically in online dating scenarios.

I once had a date with a dude who seemed super charming online, but then in real life was extremely awkward.  We had such great witty banter online, and in real life he couldn't recognize a joke, and it kind of resulted in him just not respecting my intelligence at all.  Like, I made a joke about how odd it was that we still measure cars in ""horse power"" as if that was some kind of relevant metric, and he said ""Well, actually, people used to use horses to pull their carts, so that's why people compare cars to them.""  Like just really nicely and politely explaining to me entirely obvious things as if it were totally normal that an adult woman wouldn't know what a horse was, not realizing that I was joking, but also not being like ""What?!  You don't know why we use horsepower are you serious?""  And I kept riding out the date thinking ""well, maybe I'm just not recognizing his jokes let me give this some more time.""  But then we got in his car at the end of the date, to bring me back to my car, and he kissed me so hard and badly, and he was like ""Ooh, you like that, huh?""  And I was just thinking, what am I going to say to this man who has me isolated in his car?  No?  But that was also the moment when I realized holy shit this guy is not joking, he is just super awkward.  But that's ok I'm going to tell this story to all my friends and it's going to be funny, just like my other funny awkward OKCupid bad date stores.  But then he was like ""I knew you were a bad girl.""  And what?  What am I supposed to say to that?  And I couldn't think of a thing to say to politely get out of the date.

Like, imagine if you went over a friend's house, and they offered you some cookies, and you accept one, but the moment you bit into it, they started saying ""I just knew you'd love these cookies!  I spent all day looking for a recipe for paleo low carb cookies just for you, and I knew you'd love them!""  Like, before you took the cookie, you might have said ""Oh no thank you I'm not hungry"" and that would have been a polite way out.  But now, you have no choice in normal social norms but to say ""Oh wow thank you it's great!""  Even if you don't like the cookie, and you're on a weird diet where you *don't eat cookies*.  But now once you've said yes to a cookie, and you've told the tiny lie that you liked them, it's far easier to pretend you loved the cookies and ask for the recipe and just say nice things about them until you get home than it is to accurately describe that you didn't like them without hurting this person's feelings that they are so clearly wearing on their sleeve.

So that's what I'd like you to imagine when he then was like ""Well if you liked that you'll *LOVE* what we're going to do at my place.""  Like, not even asking me if I wanted to go, just assuming earnestly that I did.  And I kept thinking ""Well maybe it won't be that bad, and even if it is, it'll be such a funny story.""

But then when I'm at his place and he's shouting the worst most degrading things to me interspersed with lines directly from Archer during terrible sex, I'm realizing that as hilarious as this looks as a vision from above, I can *never tell this to anyone*.

As I got older and more mature, I learned to trust my instincts, and recognize shit people well before that point of no return moment, but I don't think I have ever discovered a way I am comfortable responding in that point of no return moment that would result in any kind of a different result, and that feels so weird to me.  And it's so hard to articulate to others just how difficult it is to say ""no thank you"", because you say it too early and you haven't given him a chance, and you say it too late and it feels like you're calling him a rapist.  It's just so bizarre and weird and gender roles are dumb and that's it, that's my long rambling story."

"It's so cool to see someone that is so utterly useless at *everything* slowly learn how to be a person. 

My daughter is 18 months old. This week she is a little parrot. Every time I finish a sentence she repeats the last word back to me (or, at least she attempts to). 

She's been watching what I do, and now when she finished her snacks she puts her plate in the sink. When she changes her clothes, she sits them by the washing machine. When she finds something that might be rubbish, it goes in the recycling. Like, I never made a point to actively teach her these things, she's just a sponge learning everything I do.

And her sense of humour, it slays me. She was toddling about last week and half of her fruit bat fell on the floor as she was taking a step and her foot landed on it. She froze, looked down, then I swear to god her shoulders *slumped* and she said ""Tragic"" in the most defeated sigh I've ever heard. Let me repeat, she is one and a half and the queen of dramatics. 

I told her it was bedtime last night and she took my face gently in her hands before pushing me down onto the pillow and whispering ""Shhhhhh"" (which is my go to sleep noise) before she shimmied off the edge of the bed and spent 15 minutes trying to figure out how to get my slippers to stay on her feet."

He would put down the slice between each bite, chew about 60 times, swallow, and then ask me a question. If I was talking, he couldn't multi-task or eat or drink. He would sit with his hands folded and stare at me. I finished my food literally HOURS before him. During the last hour, I didn't even try and talk to him. It was painful.

She said he looked at her sooooo strange because he was content doing his crossword puzzle on a day off from baseball. She said the conversation was really awkward, too. Then before she left, she asked if she could add him on Facebook. He said “uhhh, no. How about we get each other’s phone numbers and allow me to call you so we can talk.” 

He later told her that the entire situation caught him off-guard because he’d never met a woman so bold. He said she stuck out unlike anyone he’s ever met and after she left, he just couldn’t stop thinking about her. He’s a very, very attractive man and could get any woman, but he said she was different he had to know exactly who this woman was. He waited a few days and then called her and they started dating. They didn’t text, only talked or saw each other in person, kind of the old fashion way. 

But it worked. Five years and 3 kids later, they are one happily married family. 

I told her I’ll never be that bold, I’m just way too shy to ever do something like that. However, I notice that when I do step out in boldness, things happen!

He'd recently had brain surgery (VERY recently, like a couple months previous) and was still having some problems. Mid-thrust, he pulled out, said, ""Hang on a minute, babe,"" and proceeded to go into a grand mal seizure. 

Luckily -- and this was unusual -- my hands happened to be cuffed in front of me, so I was able to get the blindfold off to see why the hell he made that weird noise. Still cuffed and chained, I managed to get him rolled on to his side -- thank god we were on the bed and he hadn't rolled off. I couldn't find the handcuff keys. 

I managed to get the chains off my legs and about that time he came back around. I asked him where the cuff keys were and he looked at me like he had no idea what any of those words meant. Then he noticed I had handcuffs on and in all sincerity, asked me who the hell had done that to me. I said, ""Uhhh, you did, babe."" ""BULLSHIT! You're joking!"" And then I got worried because he'd forgotten his own fetish. 

Finally, I found the cuff keys, and also his meds. Fed him his meds, stayed with him that night. He was up and ready to go to finish things up in about an hour. *We still did It.* 

Hands down, my weirdest sexual experience. I still chuckle about it sometimes. Note: That was a loooong time ago, and he has been seizure free for quite a while, moved across the country a couple years ago. We're still friends. We never speak of The Unfortunate Sex Seizure Incident of 2012®. "
"Gaslighting was a big sign in my relationship. They'd tell me I didn't remember things correctly (food orders, times to meet, the movie we chose) and then I'd be inconsiderate for not meeting at the right time or stupid for getting his order wrong. 

Feeling the need to apologize for existing. Sometimes you'll mess up or forget something. I once apologized for breathing too loudly during a movie... 

I hope you're asking this out of curiosity and not out of necessity. But if you are, you can get out. Please be safe."
"He's high-functioning autistic. That makes him weird and quirky some times, and unable to process feelings. He also hasn't got many facial expressions other than... expressionless.

I'm high-functioning autistic too so I understand all too well where he comes from, even though he's the logical no-expression type and I'm the emotional my-face-is-crazy type."
"&gt; You tend to want to discuss the problem more than your SO does (hint: only you see any problem)

I feel like this is way too situational to call it a clear cut sign of being an emotional abuser.

Same for the thing with knowing where the line is. Everything else is pretty spot on.

"How is Jared Leto still relatively untouched???? He's scum, and everyone knows it, but his name has been so absent. "
The very first one. There's a ! over my coffee maker and I need to get my ass out of bed and start my adventure.
"Yes, no offense to OP whatsoever, but this question always seems like such a straight person thing to ask. I’m also bisexual and I always find that these “can men and women *really* just be friends?” questions are odd. If not I would have no friends."
"He knew that I desperately wanted to get married and have children in the future. He led me to believe that that was his plan 100% as well .

I found a bill for his vasectomy that had been done two days prior"
"Oh absolutely. 

It just took me a little time to get over my own insecurities and low self esteem and realize he obviously liked me better, and that I absolutely had redeeming qualities of my own. "
On Writing by Stephen King truly made a world of difference for my writing. I’ve reread it so many times that my copy completely fell apart and I had to buy a new one.
"Eh, I’d anonymously send her a link to the pic. If she knew about it, she’ll ignore it. If not, she’ll know it’s out there. I’d want to know it was out there. "
Well it involves LOTS of sweating
"I had a lot of them, throughout my early 20's, so many that few of them really stand out. I also, reading that story, thought a lot about how many I dodged. Early in the story, Margot talks about him ""punishing"" her for long silences by going silent in return, moving the burden of communication to her. Sometimes I'd pursue men who did this, while more often I wouldn't feel like that and in return I'd let the relationship lapse and move on.

I slept with a lot of guys that I really had no sexual interest in, because I have a low sex drive and I felt that I wasn't allowed to be disinterested - that being disinterested meant a problem with me, not with them, and that I should just keep trying. And also because, like Margot, I was uneasy when thinking about how the guy would react if I said no outright.

The only specific individual that stands out to me was a coworker, who I've written about before as part of discussions of workplace harassment. He seemed like nice enough nerdy guy. When my computer broke, he offered to come over and fix it, and I made certain he knew I intended to pay him.

He didn't fix the computer when he came over - he broke it worse - and then declined my offer of payment and offered to ""make it up"" to me by taking me on a date. I declined, and he stepped into my space. I backed away, still declining the offer, until he literally backed me into a corner in my own living room, pressed back between a bookshelf and a wall, and I finally said yes.

I rationalized when he left - it was weird, but he was just a nerd. I was a nerd too. I was awkward and often misinterpreted signals. Dinner would be fine.

We met that weekend for dinner and a movie. He asked me over dinner about guys I'd dated in the past. I told him, laughing, about a guy I'd dated the year prior who got clingy on the first date, texted me constantly, and then threw hissy fits via text if I didn't respond fast enough. This guy laughed at the story too. 

As soon as the movie was over, the texts started. I barely responded. He didn't get upset that I wasn't responding, but he got pushy. If I mentioned going to a party with my roommate, he tried to invite himself. He literally texted me  25+ times in a single day, while I only responded to a few of those. 

After a couple days of this, I tried to break it off kindly. I told him I wasn't really interested in being as serious as he apparently was right now. I told him he texted too much, was too clingy, even asked why he thought it was okay after I told him about the previous guy.

He responded by sending me increasingly lewd messages. I blocked him on my phone. He sent them through our company IM service instead - refusing to take no, continuing to ask for dates, suggesting that if I didn't want a relationship we could be fuckbuddies until I fixed my ""commitment issues"".

I took screenshots of his messages and gave them to our boss. She did nothing. A week later, I quit with no notice. 

A year later, he found me on facebook, and the messages started again."
"Does he by chance have obsessive compulsive disorder? These sounds like obsessions over food related illnesses and the dishes point was a perfect example of a compulsion, particularly if he’s apologising afterwards. Just a thought!"
"Only think I'd worry about, if he is having sex with someone else (no matter the gender) is to be sure it's safe. You mom doesn't deserve to get an STD because of your dad's infidelity. Not sure how you'd bring this up though... My first thought is just tell your dad that you'd seen the app and talk to him as an adult, tell him you're not judging and its none of your business but do mention the whole STD thing and tell him that's the only thing you're worried about because honestly the rest is between your parents and not you; but that would definitely be devastating if your mother ended up with a life threatening illness because of your dad's cheating. "
"That it's my duty as a woman to have kids, and my only duty, and if I don't do that I'm doing it wrong. Not that the person who said that to me knew it, nor did I know it at the time, but I later developed uterine cancer and had to have a hysterectomy. Reducing me to my womb was insulting at the time but is now utterly rage-inducing in retrospect."
"They could be for medical reasons (the fetus wasn’t viable somehow, your mother couldn’t carry for some reason) or because of some life circumstance you don’t know about. For example, a friend of mine wants to have more children but can’t at the moment because of some health issues that would make carrying a baby right now life threatening. People have abortions for lots of reasons. I wouldn’t let this eat at you. "
I touch his butt a lot.
"Learn love languages! Mine is physical touch and quality time. My husbands is acts of service. It helps us communicate to each other that we love them in a way they really feel it. 

Communicate. Even if it feels like a silly thing to talk about (we have had a conversation about how he opens cereal bags - and how we fold towels). Little things can add to big things so just talk about all of it. 

Go on a date once a week (even if it’s at home watching a movie together with no phones)

So nice things for each other.

I give my husband a kiss and say love you before he leaves for work every day. 

We still talk to each other at lunch time (he calls me).

"My own student ID somewhere on campus where I had never been. Also, didn't notice my ID was missing at all, which I attribute to me being chaotic."
"I actually ran into a guy in one of my social networks (not to be confused with social media) who was complaining about holding the door open for not one, but *TWO* unappreciative women. I asked him what their reactions were, and it was simply that they silently went through the door without telling him thanks.

I had a Come-To-Jesus with him about transactional (doing something with the expectation that you'll get something in return) and how holding a door isn't transactional and until he can get over his transactionalitis, he ought maybe not to hold doors."
"My aunt fostered me when I was 11 and adopted me at 13. When I moved in, the first things she did was throw out all my old clothes because she thought they were trashy. Then she took me to a salon and had them cut my waist-length, strawberry blonde hair into a very short ""mom bob"". She claimed I wasn't responsible enough to care for it... Despite having dinner so for a long time at that point.

I was super poor before moving in with her family and my hair was the only thing that people had ever complimented me on. It was the only thing I had been proud of that my addict parents couldn't pawn off.

Looking back on our relationship as an adult, it was the first act in a pattern of controlling behaviors designed to remind me of my ""place"" in the family. Removing an already vulnerable child's bodily autonomy, even over something like hair, can have serious, long-lasting effects."
"The biggest one for me was a DJ who lived with his folks. He seemed so nice until it became obvious that his niceness was an act. An act put on way too srongly. When I brought him back to my place, he was cute and I did want to have sex but... It was not good.

He treated me like a piece of meat, a ""sex doll"" , as the story put it. There was no emotion in the act other than this guy playing out a porno fantasy in his head. I was afraid to tell him that none of his efforts felt good. Because he didn't make me physically cum everywhere, (really not an important part of sex to me) he felt the need to apologize and torment himself relentlessly for hours about not being man enough.

.. One of the most exhausting nights of my life. "
"When I was about 8 years old I was mad at my mom for something. We had this old chicken shed that we used for storage/playhouse. I left her a note saying I was going to live there and not to worry because I took kool-aid and crackers to live on. It was cool being on my own, making my own rules. I set up a fold out lawn chair to lay on, put a blanket and pillow on it. Took a book. But, several hours later, I had to pee. So I knocked on the back door and asked to use the bathroom. And my mom said no! LOL. She told me I moved out and wasn't allowed to use the bathroom at her house anymore. So I had to 'move home'. We have been cool since then."

I think most of them are more open minded about LGBTQA+ people. 
"I'm going to back up a few steps from the other advice. If you can detect it while it's early, it's easier to get out of it. 

1) Love bombing, specifically expensive gifts, profuse and over the top praise, putting you on a pedestal, rapid attachment (never met anyone like you, etc.) They are trying to rope you in by feeling indebted to them. 

2) Loss of interest if you don't respond right away. They are looking to build control, and need that feedback to see if you are worth their investment. 

3) Early oversharing, particularly if their ex is ""crazy,"" or they are just the victim of unfortunate circumstances. These are stories they have told themselves to justify their behavior. They need to make sure you buy it, because that makes you more likely to buy their emotional manipulation later.

4) Needing to be rescued. This often looks like being a single parent who needs help with the kids, or being in financial difficulties beyond their control. 

There are others, but that should get you started, anyways. "
"I’ve always been really into thin, tall guys but my current SO has some junk in the trunk and I gotta admit it makes cuddling pretty awesome. Also I love how strong he is. The fact that he wears bigger pants than I do is a great self esteem boost haha. "
"He can get really into things he is interested.

He likes college basketball and politics. I will happily watch a game and try to stay informed and politically active. But when he is getting out his basketball statistics spreadsheets (yes, multiple) and watching the 2 a.m. CSPAN2 post office renaming vote, my interest stops.

Seriously, I think he is pretty easy to get along with."
"Before I realized I was a... Ladies lady, I went on a date with a guy who had apparently been really into me all throughout highschool. Despite never taking to me. First red flag there. 

He gave me a ride. It was the dead of winter but he didn't wear a coat and thought it was weird that I wore a coat, because the theater would be warm? Weird. He also asked why I was so dressed up and I REALLY wasn't. 

Anyways he insisted on paying for my movie ticket even though I was uncomfortable with it. Which I guess that is actually par for the course. But we had only stinted, one sided conversation the whole night. 

We tried to fool around later in his car and he prematurely ejaculated on me. Which like not to shame guys, but we really hadn't gotten far at that point. And the next time we met up he told me he loved me and I was like hmmmmmmmmmmmm let's not see each other ever again. "
Mine was definitely my robot vacuum. I don't have any pets right now (and I'm not in the habit of pooping on my floors) so I haven't had to worry about it spreading pet messes around my place. It's amazing how much it picks up and it's so nice to be able to vacuum more frequently without having to do it myself!

"He can seem mean, off-putting, angry, cold from a first glance. He’s a bit of a tough nut to crack, and often acts how you might imagine an angry cat in human form. He can have mood swings or get upset from little things. 

But he’s lovely, and funny, and incredibly loyal once you do break through. And once you realize a lot of his mood swings aren’t actually him being mad, but just anxious or frustrated, it’s easy to resolve. I have a few friends who say they couldn’t handle him, but also say that they can’t think of a better pair. "
"he's an atheist, I'm a pagan, he celebrates winter solstice with me which is basically pagan christmas, and since I was raised in a casually protestant house most of our decorations are normal christmas decorations, just no baby jesuses or angels.

"I can't say I enjoyed it, but I certainly found it relatable. In my younger years, I had my fair share of sex I didn't really want but couldn't see a persuasive reason not to have. That third-party view of sex -- being aware of how you look/feel to your partner instead of actually being connected to your body's own sensations -- was also familiar. 

I did feel somewhat sorry for Robert, who really didn't do anything wrong except be a bit of a mismatch for her and demonstrate how woefully poorly porn prepares men to have sex that's good for both partners, until the very end. Then my sympathy evaporated within five letters. 

I felt it had a lot to say about how women are socialized to prioritize men's feelings. How many times did Margot worry that he was going to break? How many times did she worry that he might harm her but didn't want to come across as nervous or uncomfortable? That all felt familiar too. "
I switch over to ass breathing until I get back inside.
"I'll give you a light one, OP: 

My very first ""relationship"" at the age of 13 ended because he saw me reading *The Da Vinci Code* and said, ""Wow! That book looks hard,"" which was the moment I realized that all of his weird comments about me being super smart were not actually jokes, and that when he said he didn't read books he meant he really didn't read books, and that it was possible that even though everyone else in my grade considered him a serious catch, he could still fail to be my ideal boyfriend, because my ideal boyfriend would know that *The Da Vinci Code* is a very silly book. And then I broke up with him, which didn't break his heart because I think he already had his eye on another girl on our school bus, and seven years later he messaged me on Facebook and congratulated me on still being super smart and he seems very happy and plays drums in a band. "
It's not a woman's responsibility to make a random dude more fuckable.  Figure it out.
"He can be a bit of a snob. The type who doesn’t shop at Walmart unless it’s an emergency and only buys name brand food and clothing. I grew up super poor so it’s a bit jarring to go shopping with him and whenever I pick things out, I feel almost like he judges me a little for buying off-label items. But I know that is a product of his upbringing and he would never use my past to hurt me. 

I replied to another post above about his tendency to hold onto things forever. 

He shows 100x more emotion in text than he does in person. He’s way more open with his feelings. We met through a mobile game so the entire time I was getting to know him before I met him in real life was via text. And since we don’t live together, our primary form of communication is via text. Idk I just feel like he opens up so much more when we aren’t face to face. "

"Your story really made an impression on me.

 I volunteer for a children's advocacy group. One big thing foster parents don't really get is they are not allowed to just cut their Ward's hair. I help the kids talk to their foster parent; like mediate between them face to face or they may just call me and tell me about a parent wanting to cut and them being against it. I then bring it to the parents attention. It comes up a lot.

I never thought that....... it's all some of them have that is theirs. Kids have had to leave scenes with NOTHING but the clothes they have on. Even those are taken and replaced in the DFS office before placement.

I will remember your story and probably share a brief version of it often. This story gives me something to relate to."
This hits way too close for comfort :-\
"A woman he worked with reached out to me and told me that they had been having sex. I confronted him, and he told me that she was crazy, she was just manipulative, and I shouldn't believe a word of it. 

I searched his phone and found pictures that confirmed it. The end! "
"Posted this a while ago in Montreal sub but do not know how to find it. I have been a chronic runner, bicyclist and walker with my wife for some 25 years here. I (we) regularly see women's underwear on the street...I am not making this up. My wife was very skeptical when I first said this to her but repeated observations has convinced her it is a real phenomenon. 
We just can't for the life of us explain it. Underwear tossed out a car window in a fit of passion? Lost on the way to or from the gym? Clotheslines are not much used any more so. 
Do not know if this is limited to Montreal but swear it is a thing here. "
Our vaginas are now breathing manually. 
"I have two.

The first one I went on this date with this guy. He was ok looking, we had decent conversations originally. We go back to his place after a few drinks and he puts on a KIDS movie and then instantly attacks my face with terrible kissing and in a second he tries to take off my shirt. I say, I’m not having sex with you And he says ok. He started squeezing my boobs and they were bruised the next day. At this point I was kinda drunk and it was too late. He dry humped me for hours which was painful and awkward and he tried dirty talking and I clearly was like, not into it. Then he asks for head and I think ok well if he cums this can be over with. I barely put his dick in my mouth and he cums, but in a second he starts humping me again and again and hurting my boobs and stuff. Then he has me give him head... again. In the morning he dry humps me more and more and asks for sex but I refuse. (At one point he pathetically tries to give me head for 5 seconds that was awful too)

The second one was a short dating relationship I had that began and ended with rape.

I was super damaged having just been out of a relationship and I was heartbroken. I met this guy on tinder. We end up having a few drinks, we hook up (not sex) and he seems chill. Second date comes - we have a few drinks and head back to his place. We start booking up again and before I know it he’s putting his penis inside of me. He starts going then goes “do you wanna wait?” And I say “kinda, I do”but at this point he’s already thrusting hard and either doesn’t hear me or ignored me. Oh. And halfway through he asks if I want a condom on. Which I did. 

We see each other a few more times. I justify the rape in my head as an overzealous hookup, not a rapist with bad intentions. 
One night he gets me really drunk. He takes me to his place as usual. He asks me if I wanted to try handcuffs and I drunkenly say sure as I’ve done that before and it’s nbd. He handcuffs me from behind and starts fucking me, then pulls out and starts lining his dick up to my asshole. I say no, I don’t want anal but he doesn’t listen and starts fucking my ass completely dry. I start crying and telling him it hurts but he doesn’t listen so I give up. 

In the morning we have sex again, not because I wanted to but because at this point I realized no was meaningless to him. I got home and broke it off via text and blocked him on everything."
Hundreds of dollars. Was in a parking lot and saw what looked like some random paper blow by. It was a bunch of $20 bills. Like 30 or 40 of them and I started chasing them around the parking lot picking them up. Probably looked like an idiot from a ways away but felt like I hit the mini lotto!
"It happens, but people act like it's to support some wealthy lifestyle.  Really, most often it's for necessities that can't be covered by SNAP--toilet paper, gas, soap, etc.  Sometimes drugs, but what do you expect when you prevent people from accessing mental healthcare and addiction counseling?  And regardless, it's not nearly as prevalent as people pretend it is. "

"I dated a dude for a while who was really into getting slapped in the balls. Like, he LOVED it. I was happy to oblige, but it was strange because it went against all my instincts and my entire sex life up until that point which had taught me not to smack people in the nuts. "
"A few days after conception (I'm assuming), I had the most distinctive taste in my mouth, like I was sucking on dirty coins.  Metallic, but not bloody.

"Looking back, this one is actually hilarious! It was my own doing for going on practically a blind date. This guy didn't do anything creepy or mean-spirited, he was just bizarre.

I saw a cute barista at Starbucks when I was a freshman in college at the mall. He was around my age and, since the shop was empty, I struck up a conversation and found out he was studying architecture. That really fascinated me, so I gave him my number and told him I'd love to hang out some time. Later that night, he texted me and we set up a date. I might mention the music was really loud in that Starbucks so I couldn't hear his voice well.

When we go on a date a few days later, he shows up 30 minutes late, wearing a backwards snapback and baggy pants down to his mid-thighs (I'm not judging people that wear those, but I felt like he didn't put much effort into looking nice for the date). I also didn't realize that English wasn't his first language (he told me he recently moved from Taiwan) and that he was somewhat hard to understand. Again, that's not a problem, it just came as a surprise and made it a little harder for us to communicate. 

Anyway, he insists on buying me boba, so we get boba together and start talking about school. I ask him about architecture, but after ten minutes he wants to change the subject. He's interested in the fact that I'm wearing glasses. I might mention here that he has a really reedy, nasally voice and says ""I didn't know you were a neeeeeerdy girl, haaaaaaa!"" I was embarrassed because he said it really loudly, and I try to change the subject but he keeps turning it back on me being nerdy, and how he thinks nerdy girls are cute. I'm really not feeling it with him at this point, but he then starts telling me how hard life has been for him since he moved from Taiwan and how he doesn't have many friends and his dad left his mom. I felt really sad for him and started trying to comfort him, but I also realized we wouldn't work out as a couple. I told him I'd like to be his friend and hang out more, which was true, even if partly out of sympathy. At the end of the date, he asked me for a kiss, but I told him I'd feel better if we were just friends and if he'd be okay with a hug. We hugged and he seemed cool with being just friends. However, later that night he texted me saying ""I think your nerdy side is cute hahaha."" I was weirded out and didn't text him back, and he never texted me to hang out again. 

He didn't do anything bad or mean, it was all just really awkward, and I think the language barrier didn't help! "
"There have been a few but one comes to mind for its sheer stupidity. In college, this dude said that men and women's minds work differently: men have different ""boxes"" in which they could store different information which makes them better at multi-tasking/doing things/feeling things. Women on the other hand only have one box which is why they're always confused and unable to focus on multiple things/feelings at a time.

So. dumb. Us ladies present were all shooting daggers at him. If glares could kill!"
Done and done.
"My small breasts.  My chest and hips aren't balanced and I don't fill out dresses well.  I also felt like less of a woman, but now I love my boobs and relish in not having to wear a bra or deal with back pain/bra shopping issues.  I can run more easily than other friends with larger boobs, and I've never had a complaint from a partner."
"I mean, we already put our mouths on other people's genitalia, and we don't even know where those have been.  It isn't like a dick is as dirty as a foot that's been everywhere either.  

If I can suck a dick without getting weird hangups over it, I don't see why a guy can't suck his own for the same reason.

This may be the weirdest thing I've ever typed on the internet...."

"I used to watch football with my ex, at least one game every week (15 minutes pre-talk, 45 minutes first half, 15 minutes break, 45 minutes second half, so 2 hours in total), followed his favorite team on instagram and facebook, and discussed football with him. I hate sports. When I tried to show him something I liked, like a 5 second long cute puppy video on instagram, he sighed and turned back to his phone. When we fought about it, he said that he didn't care about my cute animal interest, and that he thought that the effort I put into his football was way lower than the effort he put into watching puppy videos.

The shared interests aren't important imo, it's the effort you put into your partners interest. If you're just gonna be an ass about their interest then yes, having different interests are gonna lead to a problem."
"He's very weird about food.  

* He won't eat any ~~vegetables~~ plants except potatoes, green beans, corn (not on the cob), and lima beans.  Tomato sauces have to be completely smooth, no chunks.  Even most seasonings are off the table.  Mind you, I *fucking love* vegetables.

* If he so much as suspects that onions were anywhere near his food, he won't touch it.

* He won't eat meat cooked at home.  He has to pretend it was never raw, which means lots of frozen, pre-cooked meat.

*No fish or seafood whatsoever

* He's extremely paranoid about food from restaurants.  This is why we rarely go to sit-down restaurants.  I think we've been out... maybe once or twice in 5 years without him getting paranoid about something being undercooked or sitting out too long.

* Dishes are never clean enough unless he washes them himself.  But I'm still usually the one who does the dishes, which means pots and pans often get washed *three times*: hand washed by me, dishwasher, then hand washed by him again.  This one actually really annoys me, but at least he apologizes for it. 

* Most dairy products often ""smell wrong"" to him.  He still eats cheese and cooks with butter and milk, but he worries about it for hours afterward.  "
My sense of smell rivaled that of a bloodhound. Very early on in both pregnancies.
How YOU doin?
"You see yourself as the more mature partner in your relationships. Your SO needs your guidance to avoid screwing up their lives.

You get angry sometimes, but it's because of stress in your life, or someone is pressing your buttons. You need to express your anger so they understand how important things are to you.

You see people as untrustworthy and need to keep tabs so you can be sure their story always checks out. If they aren't willing to tell you where they are, or if they're late then it means they're hiding things from you.

"
"I didn't but my mom did. Her hair was her pride as a teen, she took very good care of it. Well one day as punishment for whatever happened, my grandmother forced my mom to get her hair cut. My mom sobbed the whole time. She's never had long hair again but she does take care of it and maintains its color and whatnot. My grandma and aunt still give her shit for being so into her hair. It effects her self esteem  for sure after she sees them. As a parenting result she let me and my brother do whatever we wanted with our hair, no matter how silly it seemed. "
Not. I’ve lived as a white woman in the south for most of my life. I know what conservative southern women say when they think you’re “one of them.”
She is absolutely right that her son is an amazing person.
"This story was almost painful for me to read in that it's basically the blue print for every sexual encounter I've ever had, of which there were many. 

It got to the point of being so disgusted I'd invite guys over and then just radiate black fury until they got the hint and left. 

So much of my sexuality was wrapped up in being wanted but men never wanted me the right way so I'd overanalyze situations in the attempt to give the men I was with at least a sliver of personality beyond what had already disappointed me. 

I found very often,  men don't try.  They don't try to be interesting,  they don't know how to make conversation.  They don't know how to be sensual in the slightest.  They expect you to take their half limp dicks and half limp seductions like a champ,  without complaining.  
Then when they've literally done nothing to turn you on or try to pleasure you aside from some off tempo pumping, they get offended when the answer to ""how many times did you orgasm"" is ""none"".

"I was a huge Johnny Depp fan from the time I was 12. Pirates of the Caribbean was one of my favorite movies and I had a ton of merch and even considered getting a tattoo - the sparrow over the sunset one that Depp actually has for real.

As a victim of domestic violence myself, the situation with Amber Heard really hit home for me. I haven't watched any of his movies since, and even threw out some of the old PotC stuff I had around because it seemed weird now (I had pillowcases with Jack Sparrow's face on them. That was a thing.)"
"CANDLES. I freaking love candles. They smell good and they are fire, and when tornadoes hit you can burn them for light. Candles are the best. 

I hope I get some candles for Christmas. "
"When I moved out on my own and started living my own life was when the shit really hit the fan for my parents too. Things have never really been the same. I was certainly hurt and shocked by the amount of conflict drawing that red line generated. I knew they would over react, but I didn't realize it was going to be years of harassment and estrangement. It's like they had convinced themselves that if they put in enough discipline tokens the output would be that they would have an unquestioningly obedient daughter with no will of her own, and would be a perfect mirror image of their opinions and opinions of a husband that holds an identical world view as theirs. They claim that they were deeply traumatized when I finally found the means to cobble together some semblance of autonomy because I didn't turn out how they wanted. "
"I have recently broken the habit of pooping on the floor. Now, I can get a Roomba. "
I wouldn't be surprised if James Franco got outed. There are rumors on the web that tell of him sexually harrassing women. There's also that scandal where he was caught flirting with a teenage girl through Instagram. I heard that that incident might have just been a PR move for a movie but I doubtful.
"""Literally"" never happens is a strong statement since almost everything happens once in awhile in a world of 7 billion people.

That said, very, very, _very_, VERY few people begging on the streets are secretly sneaking off to their mansion at the end of a long day of publicly selling their dignity for a few dollars."
"To me, it resonated very strongly. I never hooked up with an older man (though everything prior to that is very resonant with an older guy I hung out with but backed out before we got intimate), or had quite the same circumstances, but the overall arc of what happened is incredibly familiar to me. I could almost assemble the exact same story from two different experiences in my life. 

The initial confused attraction and curiosity, the sudden realization that you’ve been attracted to a fantasy of a person that *you* built up, but feeling as if you couldn’t stop what had been set into motion and so just decided to go along with it — yes, yes I’ve been there. 

So yeah, I deeply appreciated it. Interestingly, a ton of my guy friends have been really interested in it and asking me questions about it, and I think that’s really cool. "

"I don't remember ""Happy Holidays"" ever being a problem when I was growing up. Like I really just don't understand how this became an issue. "
"Pretty much instantly. I don't want to use the term ""love at first sight"" because that's for Hollywood, but even before our first date I could tell there was something incredibly special about him."
"A subtle one, IMO, is when a relationship just feels like hard work *from you*. For instance, if your partner always seems dissatisfied at you, no matter what you do. Or if your partner seems to constantly demand more. 

Another, more obvious one is not accepting your 'no'. Ie when every time you say no, they'll debate with you as though it's negotiable, rather than respecting your boundaries for what they are.

"&gt; he felt the need to apologize and torment himself relentlessly for hours about not being man enough.

these types tend to be the most furious at the prospect of women faking orgasms, too, without considering that they are the cause.

also why you can never let on that the sex is bad, i mean look at them strutting around like roosters thinking they rocked your world and they're awesome. it's hard to bring someone down from that when you could just keep your mouth shut and let them be pleased with themselves."
"My grandmother used to sleep without underwear because she insisted it ""choked"" her. I wonder if it's related to this vaginal breathing thing."
"I'm rather cold as a person.  It is not my first instinct to be friendly, ""open up,"" etc.  This used to bother me and I wanted to change it, but I'd try to change and find myself exhausted (very classic introvert) or just feeling like there was no point at all to it.  I'm not *mean*.  I'm just not the person that people choose to talk to, probably because I give off a vibe of ""don't bother me"" in both my physical demeanor and my tendency toward matter-of-fact replies.

I don't care anymore.  This is my personality.  I am warm and happy and friendly with those I am close to, and that's good enough for me.  "
"Found out about a female classmate, via reliable source close to the incident, that she had molested a 3-4 year old boy she was babysitting when she was 17. specifically, she performed oral on him

"I was asked this. I said ""I don't think that's an appropriate question."" And she moved on. I got the job."

"I'm Jewish and he's Catholic, but neither of us are very religious. We light Hanukkah candles and have a Christmas tree (no angels or baby Jesus decorations). When we got together, I was so excited to celebrate a traditional Christmas with a feast on Xmas eve, and then I found out that his family doesn't cook and orders Chinese food instead! Such a disappointment.  "

"I'm a master flirt. I do it all the time and with everyone and probably too much. Usually I'll tailor it to the person I'm flirting with, some like a little more banter, others just want you to flutter your eyelashes at them or the classic body language stuff, fiddling with your hair, etc. 

I've been doing it for a long time, sometimes professionally, and I'm very good at it. It's been an issue in past relationships, though fortunately not the current one. He knows that's just how I am and it doesn't mean anything, though I have made an effort to mostly use my powers on him now. He still gets a bit flustered when I go full steam ahead so that's pleasing for me."

"Please tell her!  As someone who has BPD, I can say that life is so awfully chaotic and hard to understand until you realize that you have it.  I’m also assuming you want her to get better, and the best way to do that is to tell her so she can get the treatment that she needs."

I liked Edge of Tomorrow though, that was an excellent film. "
"We did the [love language](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/) and [apology language](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/apology/) assessments and then had a conversation where we shared and discussed our results.  We've also acknowledged a couple of our differences - I like to share a lot of detail and experiences and think that my past has a huge influence on who I am today; he is much less of an open books and feels like the past doesn't matter because it's today that's important.  We've also realized that I can be rather blunt and straightforward where he can be a bit too sensitive, which means that sometimes I need to start a sentence with the disclaimer ""I'm not saying this to hurt you/I'm not trying to be harsh"" so he doesn't get defensive."
Ah yes my French grandmother’s special secret recipe. 
"My sons are both in their 20s now. There were hard moments raising them, for sure. For me, the hardest years were when they were 17-19 years old and caught in a period between being children and adults. It was hard to watch them find their way.

But there have been so many wonderful times!  They’ve made me laugh harder than I had ever laughed. They’ve taught me lessons like patience and how to be more carefree.  They gave me a job (raising them) that I sometimes failed at, but always strove to be better at.  I could write a book about the good, but only a few pages about the bad. 

They are truly my friends now, and I know they would do anything for me.  

In short, I fully gave myself to being their mother, but somehow they’ve still managed to always give more to me.

He leaves when she’s not around.  My father-in-law even gave him the house key when they went to Arizona for a week and he lived in the house during that time.  It was a close call because she could tell things looked out of place.
"As a member of the majority of women who rarely if ever get off from penetration alone, I love to get off from foreplay before having sex. Failing that, I appreciate a partner who not only doesn't get weird about me touching myself during penetrative sex, but actively encourages it and thinks it's hot. "

"Not necessarily a secret ingredient but my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies is Nestle Tollhouse. People always ask me for it because my cookies come out great, but that truly is what I use. My secret is that I do EXACTLY what the bag says to do. And know your oven. Personally, mine cooks a bit on the hot side, so I go with the lowest suggested minutes. I let them cool on the pan for exactly 2 minutes (set a timer and everything) and then transfer to a rack, just like the recipe says. Once they’re cooled, I put them in the cookie jar. They stay soft and chewy for days"
"Not me, but my mom. She and my dad froze the top layer of their wedding cake to enjoy on their first wedding anniversary. My dad and my older sister (half-sister, junior bridesmaid at the wedding) thought the cake was delicious, but my mom made them stop eating because it tasted disgusting to her and she was afraid of food poisoning. Turns out that those were the first signs of pregnancy messing with my mom's taste buds. They ordered an exact replica of the cake for a later anniversary to make up for it."
"I had a male online friend who grew up fairly poor from a small town. He was always telling us about how awful his sister is. She kept having kids with random men, used drugs, robbed stores, etc. It wasn't too surprising because honestly it sounds like a lot of people in town had issues and I knew there were family things going on. He'd dropped out of school himself as an early teen and last I heard, was still living with family in the town, no job, just doing his thing. His dropping out of school seemed to only be replaced by living at home and gaming.

Anyway, one day myself and another woman from the group were talking to him about his past and he mentions that his sister had run away a lot as a child, often for days at a time starting as a pre-teen. We both kind of realized something more was going on and he eventually told us that his sister had told them that Dad was molesting/raping her. He never believed it because his dad was the only family member he had looked up to and he still was upset by his dad passing away years before. The other person and I were talking to ourselves, though, and realizing that everything he'd ever told us about her made it really damn obvious she was a victim of sexual assault. She got into sex REALLY early, drank or did drugs all the time, her robbing was to fuel the substance abuse, she'd sleep with men left and right (and we were told for money or favors sometimes). It was a heartbreaking realization to come to.

But what do you do about it? This guy had this spotless image of his deceased father and his sister had already tried to tell him the truth before, only for him to plug his ears. I really doubt he'd be able to come to terms with it. If the dad was still alive and out there, that's one thing, but the danger to other people was pretty low at this point. His nieces and nephews were already being cared for by other family members with relatively more stable lives than his sister's. Honestly his emotional maturity had never been stellar either. So we dropped it. I still don't know if that was the right call but it's hard to press an issue pertaining to someone you've never even met before."
"I disagree. To me, ""Cat Person"" was about how women often feel obligated to have sex when they don't want to. I felt that obligation and it was awful. I was lucky because the guy I was with was kind. I've seen a lot of guys react to ""Cat Person"" with ""what am I supposed to do about this, I should just never have sex again."" I don't think that's the answer. I think the answer is to prioritize your partners feeling over you getting laid and getting verbal and enthusiastic consent. "

"I don't think that should be unpopular (unless, ofc, you're a douche at their wedding and make a scene). It can be tough to watch someone attain something that you'd like to have in life, and most people *do* feel a tinge of jealousy or envy when that happens.

My only cynical condolence is... not sure how old you are, but when the first wave of divorces begin, it might be easier to recognize that just *getting* married isn't really an achievement - if they are still happily married in 15+ years, that's different, but many of those people are marrying for the wrong reasons and will end up resentful, divorced, or both"

"I think key is to look at patterns in your relationships. If it is unique to one relationship then it may well be the relationship or the other person rather than you.

"The 1950's. I keep coming across people who feel that the '50's were the good ol' days (almost entirely by people born well after the 50's) and that everything would be wonderful if we could go back to then, that it would fix all of the country's problems.

The whole world was still reeling from WW2 and if that wasn't bad enough, there was the constant threat of nuclear annihilation on top of it all. People of color and women were second class citizens. People were more suspicious of people who weren't like them and the political climate was divisive and bitter. For all the promises of a bright future for the middle class, abject poverty was still rampant. There weren't as many opportunities and society wasn't accepting of people not living up to social norms. It was an eventful decade, it was an interesting decade and compared to the two previous decades, a hopeful one by comparison but it certainly wasn't the glamorous and magical cultural utopia that a lot of people try to paint it out to be.

Nice is a necessary but not sufficient quality to have. It's like saying you're a bipedal placental mammal. Ooookay. "

"I was 14, he was 19.  I thought we were going to hang out with a mutual friend.  We did eventually meet up with that friend for what I later realized was a double-date lunch.
