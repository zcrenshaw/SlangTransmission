"You know if she walked ""all the way"" she might actually lose some weight?"
I simply say I work behind the scenes on movie sets :)
Why would you adopt a child with a woman whose life expectancy is significantly short? What future do you see with a woman who will die young? Why do you think someone would allow a clinically obese person to adopt when she very clearly cannot look after herself let alone a dependant?
If you're offering I would have to run it by my wife! 
"Hi boogie. I'm a 46 year old mum from the UK who's never played a video game in her life. I watch your youtube channel, though, and love your work :)"
"I feel like the same person I was in my 20s. By then you know who you are and what you're about and I still feel like that same person. I look much worse and hurt more and can see less but who I am still feels the same. As far as the embarrassment goes you shouldn't be worrying at all. You can do all the childish things you want, you're not a child and everyone knows it. I act like a child all the time and no one thinks I'm a baby. Do what makes you happy and work hard, that's what adults do. If you work hard and make occasional mistakes people may be mad at you or laugh but it will pass, it always does. I made some huge huge mistakes at work but everyone I worked with would say I was a great worker. You're a lucky man with a wife, a job, and a house, you've already grown up. I feel like the person I've felt like for a long time so to answer your question, no I don't feel 70. I feel like me. Sure I look at 80 year olds and think they're old farts but that's just their body which in the end doesn't really matter. Please don't grow up. "

"I have been very blessed to be surrounded by people who prepared. I should say, not only people who prepared, but had the means to prepare. Not everyone had the money to stock up on food or buy a generator. Such as it is, I haven't had any government assistance since Maria hit. Either by FEMA or the local government. I am not complaining, because I haven't needed it yet, but there are many, many people who did and do need that assistance with food, water and communication. I have seen military water trucks in a nearby stadium, I have seen some Customs Border Patrol soldiers/officers next to the office where I work, keeping the peace because there is an ice plant next door. I have seen that they are helping us. It wouldn't be fair for me to say that his handling of this crisis has been good when I have not had the needs other people have. I have heard on the radio that FEMA is nowhere to be seen, and that in previous disasters they have set up tents in public places in order to collect information for claims and distribute tarps so people can cover their roofs. I have not seen a FEMA tent anywhere. Last I heard there were 14k+ federal employees working here. I really don't know how this compares to other disasters, but that's a lot of people I guess. 

I don't agree with him saying the mayor of San Juan has had poor leadership, and that they can't get the workers to help, and what we want everything done for us. Day 1 after Maria, many many people, myself included, were chopping down trees to open up the roads. I came to my apartment building to help people bring their stuff downstairs. Many people volunteered to serve as attendants in gas stations to keep order even with the long lines. People hand out water bottles to the cops directing traffic. We are helping eachother out. I see power authority employees working every single day. We definitely do not want everything done for us, we are just asking for help.

The media made a circus about the Trump visit. I can tell you that no one I know really cared. I am not belittling the President's visit; it shows he cares if at least. Yes, it's insulting he threw paper towels like basketballs, and that he chose a church in one of the richest suburbs, and that he said that this is not a ""real"" catastrophe like Katrina. But Trump is Trump, anyone who reads the news knows he behaves like this, and that he was gonna say/do some stupid shit while he was here. I don't mean to justify/normalize the way he behaves or what he does or says, but man, no one here cares, because we can't vote for who's president. He's just a distant figure."
"I had known that my weight was killing me since I was about 25.  The problem for me was, I wanted to die.  hated life, wasn't weak enough to do anything drastic about it.  Enjoyed food, enjoyed that it would kill me young, so I just kept eating.

Now that my life is actually worth living though I'm fighting as hard as I can.  I have a lot of work left to do though.

"When i was a kid i'd look at teenages and find it hard to comprehend being that 'old'.

When i was a teenager i looked at people in their 20's and thought '20 is so old, thats like a real adult'.

Now im in my late 20's and i still feel like the exact same person i was in school... Dont get me wrong i have a full time job, am engaged, own my own home... But most of the time i find myself thinking the same childish thoughts i did when i was a kid.
Im a big dude who lifts weights yet i still find myself experiencing that same childish embaressment i did as a kid if i mess something up... Or without realising it a do something really silly &amp; childish to make someone like me or respond to me in a certain way... I find myself telling myself 'What are you doing grow the F up'!

My question is this...
Do you feel like a 70 year old?
Do you look at people in their 80's/90's and see them as being 'old' and find it hard to comprehend yourself being that old'?

Or do i just need to grow the fuck up?
Thanks for the AMA

&amp; Have a great bday!!

"We were both commenting on a post with a question about dating from somebody much younger. We're in our 50s. He then sent me a message joking about how much dating has changed and how we need to help out this younger generation. We messaged back and forth, great chemistry from the beginning... realized we lived close, moved to texting, realized we had lots in common too and met for coffee. Going strong since :) "

We have 4 children. They are all with Queen Peach. The oldest of our children knows. Lily is just referred to as Aunt Lily... she is respected as a parent and has all the same rights within our home. Lily and I are the very strong Type A's in the relationship. We submit mostly to Peach however because she has more wisdom in most cases and processes things at a slightly calmer slower pace. All three of us are leaders and they both submit to me overall as the male and it being a Jewish home. Lily and myself respect Peach and choose to submit to Peach in bed and with most decisions we discuss them as a group and come to a decision after all sides are considered. When I fuck up I hear about it twice though. lol.
My wife is a manager who went through this. I’ll see if I can get her on.

"As the adult son of a  severely obese mother and her enabler husband, please, for the love of God, run for the fucking hills. Either that, or do not bring children into it. 

My mother's weight issues are the most passive aggressive, selfish thing I have ever had to deal with. It ruins everything, most importantly it has ruined the chance of her being a grandmother to my daughter.

She once had redeeming qualities, but the tolls of her health have eroded those. 

She is now in her mid 70s and completely bedridden. My father took early retirement to take care of her. My sister moved them into her condo to subsidize their living expenses. She is now waited on for everything, 24/7, and is a complete nightmare about it to my father (she hides it from her kids). 

My daughter cries when we have to go to their house for the holidays (the only time we now visit). She cried when she first watched The Little Mermaid and the evil with, Ursellla, appeared... She screamed ""ahhhhh, it's grandma!"" 

I wish I we making this up... Truly, I do. 

If you can't see past what weight issues like that mean, then you, like my father, need therapy.

"It just happened, I have a background in film making and a friend sort of introduced me. Was curious and it became my full time job.

I've had offers from porn stars if I wanted some free action on the side (they are extremely lustful). I declined since it freaks me out knowing what they've been up to."
"Hey Booooooooooogie :)

"Meeting my wife is the best secret I have to my health and happiness. Find someone who supports you and together you can do anything. Along with that, taking time to be alone and enjoying that time. I love my wife and kids and grandkids but having time alone to think and reflect has kept me sane. One more thing would be having an open mind. When my friends stopped wanting to try new things and keep up with the changing culture they became stereotypical crotchety old men. I don't know a lot of popular things and I don't understand most of them but I'm always willing to listen and try something new. "
Yes we do. All of us work in public service as 1st responders. 
"Assuming you see this as a possible long-term relationship, how do the potential health complications factor into your idea of a future together? e.g. having a family, growing old together."
"The biggest challenge is hard to single out. One would probably be how un relatable I feel sometimes. People my age are in college, partying, making mistakes. So they don't have much common ground with me, because I'm practically geriatric and in bed by 10.  Older people see me as a kid still usually. Even though I feel old and ""settled down,"" most people who have lifestyles like mine aren't trying to hang out with a 22 year old. 

I almost feel un relatable to myself too, because before my mom died, I was very different. I hated everyone, I drank all the time, lived alone and did whatever I wanted. I had plans to leave my state and travel the US. I told my boss my plans to quit soon, my friends and family knew. My mom even argued with me about it and begged me to change my mind. But I had plans of getting out. 

Life of course has a funny way of making plans for you. And now I wonder sometimes who I really am. I never wanted kids, but now I cry in my car if I think too long about the fact that the boys will move out one day. I used to look down on people for working 9-5 jobs with no freedom, now I am thankful for my 9-5 job because it feeds my family and offers health insurance. I always thought I was so much smarter than my parents, and that they just didn't have a clue how life should be lived. Now I lay awake at night, and wish I could just call my mom and apologize, and also ask her to repeat all the advice she gave me that I ignored. I know most 20-somethings go through this inner battle in some way, but I guess the changes are more challenging than I expected. 

That ties into what has been surprisingly easy though. I never knew I was capable of so much love. I look at them and I instantly feel like the world has purpose. I didn't know I could ever sacrifice for someone just because I genuinely was happy to do it. Much less two people. Three, when you count my boyfriends son, who I also love with all my heart. It sounds so corny but I feel like my life didn't have meaning until they came here. It's so much easier to see the world in a positive light, because they make it easy. And even though I would of course give anything for my mom to be back with us, I don't regret taking them for even a second. "
I would say 80% seem to enjoy it. They are really sexual animals. Some are so high they don't feel anything inside.

"What sort of dynamic do the three of you have sexually, and has jealousy ever been an issue?"
"Some adult performers pleasure themselves before going on stage in order to ""warm up"" and be ready to do as the director asks. Sometimes there is a ""fluffer"" who does this task also.

The director is allowed to have some action with the performers off stage as a ""perk"". This was also in a documentary where you can see the director pounding a female performer after the main filming was over.

"Not a darn thing. I didn't always make the best choices but I'm happy now and in a good place. If I would have made the right decisions I'd be a different person with a different life. Although I will add, don't smoke cigarettes it's very stupid. "

"Definitely a struggle sometimes. Fortunately, due to the nature of our childhood I've always been somewhat of an authority figure as a sister. So it wasn't as huge of a shift as it could have been. But as they get older it's definitely harder for them to see me as ""in charge."" Truthfully I would say they are generally pretty respectful, but we occasionally do have arguments where they remind me that I'm not the mother. Which can be hard to navigate, since it's technically true, haha. "

"Scale is already moving again so i think my plateua is over with.  Seemed to involve the lymphadema.

I only had 2 choices of weight loss surgeons in the area.  One was rumored to be a very difficult doctor and the other was new. I went with the new guy because he was willing to work with me even though my chances of complications were slightly elevated due to age and size.

But my doctor had recently worked on a man 100 pounds larger than me and felt like I wouldn't even be a challenge.  Turns out he was right, my surgey was 'exemplary' and over in half the time that they had expected.

"I have 4 children all with Peach. We were married between 7-10 years before Lily was added. Lily has been with us between 6-8 years.

"For almost the first whole year, I struggled against the state pretty hard actually. We were denied for any assistance because the process for guardianship took so long. They canceled our health insurance when my mom passed. I was denied for state health insurance for all three of us. 

But eventually, after reaching out to a social worker, and after she pulled a lot of strings, I was able to get small social security payments for each brother monthly. 

So to answer your question, yes. Not a lot, but it's definitely better than nothing. However in my experience, the state made it very difficult. And it likely wouldn't have turned out this way if not for the social worker that was so willing to help."
"No, apart from the adult performers if they want to ""warmup"" between scenes.

The director is allowed to have some though afterwards (which I find weird)."
Tell you parent's you slipped and got her pregnant on accident. Dude just straight up tell them. No beating around the bush.
Definitely marijuana. It would get rid of all overcrowding in the nation if it was decriminalized. The other harder drugs I'd say no to. The guys and girls that come in on meth and heroine are walking proof that those drugs should never be legal.

"I'm out of the loop as to how thus came up, but it's definitely interesting.   So thanks for volunteering!     

Are you talking about a paraurethral, or Skene's gland, or an *actual* prostate?   

If the latter:   
- Where is it located? (I have a general idea, but things are a little different for men and women, so I have no clue if that changes things.)   
- Is it fully developed?   
- Have doctors provided a theory as to how/why this came about?   
- What does it produce?  Just PSA (prostate-specific antigen), or does it actually try to produce semen?   


Either way:   
- How did you discover this?   
- Where does the PSA go?  Does it drain to the urethra?    
- (Not sure how to phrase this delicately or indelicately, sorry.) For men, the prostate responds to sexual stimulation,  does yours respond similarly?   "
"Hey boogie! Love watching your stuff :)

You're one of those guys that finally got me to do something about my weight. I'm sure you get this a lot, but I'm glad to be one of those people. I never even considered doing something until a combination of your serious videos and a transformation my friend had (from 340 to 220), because I just thought there was no way it would even be possible. I'm so glad I was wrong. I started out in June at around 360, I'm currently down to 308 as of a week ago and I feel amazing. I've been doing keto which I recall you saying you've had success with in the past and it's been going really well. Lack of carbs is of course difficult, but it gets easier as time goes on. As one of those people who is a fan of yours and was inspired to finally lose weight, I can't thank you enough :)

My question is, I understand you've been fat all your life, and now that you are happier, you are taking your weight seriously. At what point in your life did you completely understand and realize that being incredibly overweight wasn't a 'meme' or means of laughter and should actually be taken seriously?

Thanks for doing the AMA, I'm glad to be sharing my experience with you as an inspiration :D"

We all do things together they do things with each other... we do things separately. For us there are actually 4 different relationships in the dynamic.

"I’m a psychologist, but please take this as information that may be relevant, could guide you in accessing support, but is entirely presumptive on my part since I have never met you. 

Anyways ... So it is common to experience significant stressors around life transition periods. This includes moving to adulthood, becoming a couple, having kids, and retiring. We all experience these and most of us navigate it pretty well. One of the reasons we navigate it well is because we have people around us going through the same thing. A new mom who has all her friends also becoming new moms is less likely to experience post partum depression than the one who started early or the one who started late. 

I’m over simplifying this, but those around us with similar experiences provide stress barriers and normalize things.

It’s reasonable to think that you and your partner had a significant part of the last 16 years that you were in a similar life space. While you had a large age differential - you were still in a period of some stasis (the life events that induce depression risk in the life period you were both in is are not linked to a specific age - example - having a kid). Your partner however has transitioned into a new life stage and you are quite disconnected from it. This might have some impact on what’s going on. 

If this sounds like your situation you may want to look into a therapist specializing in Interpersonal Psychotherapy or IPT. If instead you find yourself stuck in your head and making negative statements and a lot of other unhelpful self talk, you may want to look for a CBT therapist. Alternatively, if your partner is amenable - a marriage counsellor may be worthwhile - but in my experience, understanding your own space before that one is helpful. 

Good luck with everything. "
"I personally only condone surgery as a last resort and I certainly hope that you put in all required effort to lose the weight without it.  Best of luck!

My endocrinologist is convinced i have a tumor in my brain that keeps my body from producing testosterone (and impacts my metabolism as well).  We have yet to fit me into an MRI machine to find out for certain.  We plan to try again in a couple of months to see if that's the case.  Certainly if it is the case the tumor is not malignant so he doesn't seem to be that worried about it.

"I think there's a difference between not being off-put and having a fetish. I know some people find heavily overweight people disgusting, I don't. It's not really a fetish. It's that the weight is not a central factor wether I find someone attractive or not. Like you might really like blondes, but if you meet a nice brunette you will still consider going out with her. That doesn't mean you have a fetish for brunettes, only that for you the color of her hair doesn't define if she's attractive or not.

I don't know if it's like that for OP too, but that might be why you felt he's not answering your question."
