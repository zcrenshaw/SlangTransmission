"""I'm not stupid.""

That's a damned lie"
"I once had someone try to barter over a discounted side table. It was some 80-90% off. His argument was that it's not going to be sold, but he'd ""take it off our hands"" for a price he made up, like he's doing us a favor I guess?

I told him no, and he of course asked for a manager. I told him I'll get one for you, but I already know their answer. He's like, ""that's not how you enter a negotiate"". It's not a negotiation! You either pay this price, or it's not yours.

Sigh."
"“Full on karate pose (no knowing karate)”

I’m sorry but this part is hilarious "
So what if you were? It's on a rack. I might do that to text a pic to someone to ask advice.
"One of my coworkers stuck her neck out to get an interview scheduled for one of our regulars who isn't usually very polite to us because she felt bad for her.

On the day of her interview, she came in, and was asked to sit at a table with a beverage to wait for the hiring manager. Her interview was scheduled for 9am and she showed up at our counter at like, 9:04 and said ""are we doing this or not? I have things to do besides wait here all morning"". 

The manager was told what she said and how she said it and sent her home on the spot without doing the interview. I guess some people just don't realize that they CAN be rejected for these kinds of jobs. "
"I hope you don't get in trouble and I hope corporate doesn't give her any freebies to shut her up.

You let fly at a rude, inconsiderate person - you're livin' the dream dude."
"I work in a small hotel and one of our policies is that to visit a guest there, a visitor must provide ID. My wealth would rival Bill Gates' if I had a $ for every time someone said things like ""my friend has my ID upstairs"", ""the last guy did it for me"", ""can you take my photocopy/picture off my phone"", ""I will only be a minute"", ""does my hospital band count as ID"", and my personal favorite, ""the police said I could go up"". "
"Lady, a lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on ours."
"I am a man.  If I was searching for lingerie for my GF I would text her a picture of what I was getting, just to make sure she would like it.

And anyway, even if I was taking the photos to jack off to later, why would anyone care?"
Yea respect for your elders doesn't work that way. My grandpa would have punched that guy if he heard him.
"We had a natural gas leak once at my (former *sniff*) work. It was the middle of the night, I was always scheduled alone as the 3rd shift employee, I'd already called the fire department. You could smell the gas. I was trying to quickly help the last few people in the store, when one guy starts testing the fucking lighters. Pardon the language, but it still makes me mad. At that point, I started yelling, stopped helping people and made everyone leave. I don't even remember what I said, I was so mad. Something along the lines of ""Do you not smell that? Are you trying to get us all blown up? That's it, I'm done, the fire department is literally on the way, everyone out! No! Leave your things at the counter, I'll worry about them later, no, I'm not selling anyone anything else! Get out!"""
"That's always the worst, when they try to change what they asked you when they find something similar. We can't call them a liar to their face, even though you SOOOOOOOO want to."
"This is exactly how you negotiate.

Offer: 90% off
Counter offer: Full price.

See. That is how it works. "
"My favourite is when a customer asks/takes something off a mani and leaves them topless so I get the awkward task of fondling the mani to get all of the clothes back on them. Many a customers staring at me not realizing that I work there (because we have essentially no uniform, T-shirt and jeans safely allowed) just thinking I'm groping the mani. Fun times."
"When I take over the world it will be mandatory for people to work several occupation types before they're considered adults (and maybe some refresher ""courses"" every X years) so people might *friggin' get it*."
"Full on karate pose....

Your eyes locked, the theme from kill Bill encounters plays. 

Top 10 anime encounters."
"I maintain that after more than a decade later my favorite job was when i worked at a xmas tree lot.    

...Obviously i never dealt with anything like this here in my time there...     

I hope that was the one stain you had on your tapestry this season."
What if he wanted to make sure he got his SO the right size/color/shape/flavour?
"&gt;Where are your phones?

Dude, this is a phone store, they are everywhere, use your eyes. "
IMO you definitely shouldn’t have offered her the discount. Just feeds the beast
I worked 16 hours yesterday since our grave guy couldn't make it in and then day shift had some call outs. I was definitely running on fumes when I started the next 8 hours but luckily my manager bought me breakfast and let me take as many smoke breaks as I needed lol. Its alway nice to hear a thank you or glad you're here when I help someone make their christmas a little better.
This is what I don't miss about retail. Without knowing the real story corporate just gives them a giftcard to shut them up. But you know if you had given him the items for free it would've been hell to pay. I hate people
"&gt; ""I'm not stupid.""

Exclusively said by people who are, in fact, stupid.

My quick story: Worked at a car stereo shop. Installed a GPS for a customer (suction cup on windshield, power in cigarette lighter, basic as can be). Calls in down the line saying it won't turn on, so we ask the obvious ""are you sure it's secure in the dock? Are you sure the charger is plugged in?"" etc. She explodes with the ""just because I'm blonde doesn't make me stupid"" line and hangs up. Calls back, next salesperson asks the exact same questions (it's standard procedure!), so now she's fuming, and coming down in person.

She quickly informed me she would smack the next person that told her to press the power button or check the cable, because she's not that stupid. She was red faced shaking mad that her intelligence was insulted by us asking the same questions we ask everyone. 

Go in the car, push the power button, it turns right on.

""How did you do that?""

""Don't smack me, but I pushed the power button (points to power button)""

""Then what's this? (she points to the eject button)""

""The eject button, you press it and you can take the screen out of the dock, see? (press button, remove, replace)""

""But when I press it, it turns off""

""Yea, it loses power when you un-dock it...""

No thank you, no apology, just told me to get the F out of her car and peeled out of the lot in embarassment. I spent the next 10 minutes dying of laughter and telling the story to everyone she screamed at. "
"99% Chance that if you said, ""No, but we have clementines which are similar."" He would have shouted ""If I wanted clementines I would have asked for them."""
"Yup. And the best part is that they think that somehow they are going to stumble upon the magical combination of words that translates to ""You ignore policy. I go do a thing."""
"""You could take off your beanie, scarf and coat.""

""No. If water touches me, I will melt."" "
Not my proudest moment. 
He probably thought I was challenging him to a dance off. 
This is a classic example of why it should never be a firing offense to call your boss a fucking idiot to their face.  Because some managers need to be called fucking idiots.
"Some people are actually just snobs and think they are above ""menial"" work.  


Had a co-worker while at Suabway who called in a lot but still expected to get paid.  On the day she got fired she strait out told every one the job was beneath her and her days were spent macking on her boy friend.  


Some people. .... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
One of these is not like the others. 
"“Here’s your sign, sir.  Wear it all the time.”"
"Considering the 'kid' is far more mature than this 'man' seems to be, I think the one who needs to watch how he's speaking is him. Since when is it okay to go up to someone and use the term 'fuck' in a way that implies rudeness like that? I'm not against the word, just against using it like this to be a jerk to people."
What I don't understand is why that wasn't your immediate response to smelling gas and why the fire department didn't tell you to get out of there immediately. 
"""sorry, fresh out. You'll have to wait for next year's Iphone harvest"""
"You need to ask your (obviously pleased) customers for more Google (and Yelp) reviews.  Having only one review makes your average too vulnerable, as you've seen.  If you can rack up 20 reviews, all 4 &amp; 5 stars, a nasty reviewer won't impact you."
"&gt; I work in retail, I was way too tired to do any skipping.

Too real

"
Get her barred for abuse of staff and trespassing. There is at least 1 manager who'd support it and by the sounds of it the rest of the staff would be happy to enforce it.
"Similar argument I had, customer wanted to buy something that was already lower than cost price.

Cust: Can I haggle on this?

Me: Sure, if you want to pay more.

Pal, it’s a £50 book at £24. Either take it, or jog on."
"It sounds like she was just out to get someone in trouble. She was offered a manager right away, which would have been the quickest resolution, but she instead pushed for the name to call corporate with, which would have been longer in getting a resolution, but more likely to give her the chance to spin some wicked tale and get compensation and make real trouble for you. You can always tell the nasty ones when they're not happy unless they're ruining someone's life over something extremely minor."
"I work at a grocery store. Old guy asked if we had tangerines, I said, ‘no, a little later in winter we will, though. Sorry.”
A minute later, he yells, “HEY!” at me from across the department, motioning for me to come over where he is.  I go over to him. He holds up a bag of clementines with this smug look on his face.
I look at him, not sure what his point or question or whatever is. 
He says, “You said you didn’t have them, just wanted you to know you do.”
I said, “These are clementine mandarins. You asked me for tangerines.”
Him, exasperated: “They’re the same! They are the same thing!”
Me: “No, th-“
Him, cutting me off:”Better learn what you sell in your store, part of your job!” As he throws bag of clementines into his cart."
Respect is earned. It's also mutual as far as I'm concerned. 
"God I fucking *adore* the feeling that the rest of the world has to adhere to American nationalism.

Real money? Are you kidding me? In what fucked yo dimension does the entire world only take American dollars?

Stupid bitch. Probably thinks every other country looks at her like a goddess because she’s American.

I hate being in the US at times."
"When i was in retail I would start making the announcement 1 hour in advance and then every 5 minutes after. 1 hour, 55 minutes, 45, 40, 35 etc. I said it in English, Spanish and French. 

My cashiers are supposed to leave at 10 pm. Not 10:03, not 10:07. 10. I'd explain that customers still trying to shop. Id have my hardliners and soft liners walk the store at 9:50 and tell customers they had to get to the registers or leave. At 9:55 I had the automatic doors turned off and had a worker manually open and close the doors to let customers out. Didn't allow anyone in unless it was a person saying they needed medicine for themselves or a child. 


The reason I started doing all that was because, on my  first night closing I had a customer walk to the register at 10:10pm with two shopping carts over filled with a bunch of small items. After scanning $900 dollars worth of items, her credit card declined. Mother fuckers started screaming at me because THEIR card declined. They refused to leave the store. The refused to call their card company. I had to call the card company for them. It finally went through. It was 11:39 pm when they finally walked out. It happened all the time, customers ignoring the closing announcements. I finally had enoigh."
"&gt;Look now you've wasted all this time defending her.

I would've just literally walked away. I treat all my coworkers like buddies and there is not a chance i'd let that fly."
"Yes I know it works, and that’s the problem. It’s exactly the tactic used by these people. The more people that refuse to give them a discount, the less we will see them try the tactic."
"He denied selling items to
-A rude customer
-After the store was closed
He denied holding the items because corporate saw it as theft. How was he in the wrong?"
He would gladly accept a nasty disease for a 30% reduction. 
"I had just gotten off the phone with the fire department, and there were only a few people already headed to the register. It was several years ago and I (naively) figured I could quickly help that hand-full of people and we could be on our way. That coupled with the fact that I'd been thrown off my guard, as I'd never experienced a gas leak before (and still haven't, thankfully) and I just wasn't thinking super clearly. Experience now tells me that the yelling to evacuate the store should come first."
"The district manager approached me a few days later to remind me I was still expected to apologize. I looked her in the eye, removed my badge, laid my keys on the counter and said I will quit but I will not apologize for that. She relented and it was never brought up again. "
