"When I was rescued I was immediately taken to the hospital, I had lots of tests done,  I remember the blue light scanning over me for semen which on me and they took DNA out of me as well, the hardest was my father coming back positive. I don’t remember that ever happening i either was to high to remember or my memory suppresses it.
He ended up getting charged with rape, among with many other things.
He was the only one who got charged, his DNA was already in the criminal data base for being a violent offender.
None of the countless men who raped me saw justice, that still haunts me.
The amount of men that will pay for sex with a child is sickening, they look like just average every day business guys. "
"I have no sex drive at all, I hope it will change. I do not like to be touched, I don’t like to kiss, cuddling is okay in little amounts.
I am also engaged, my fiancé is very understanding I do see that it is very difficult for him sometimes but he has never put me down or made me feel bad about it."
"For a very long time I was angry and resentful, I didn’t want to go to any therapy or anything like that I felt it was shameful, I’m unsure why, I continued my addiction with heroin after I was rescued, I think that was a big part. Now I’m sober and life is getting better. High hopes for the future "
If I saw you in public back then would there be any way to tell this was happening?  What warning signs are there for the above average Joe to intervene? 
"I am 21 now,
It felt like a really big hug, a relief, when I was on it I felt like I was in another state and what was happening I could block out, I ended up continuing the addiction after i was rescued.
But I am sober now."
"I skipped school nearly everyday, mostly because I was bored, I smoked weed, drank alcohol, was “promiscuous”, stole from the mall, ran away from home, disrespectful to my parents etc. I was very defiant, but my parents were pretty controlling so what was normal for teens to be doing at the time before I started acting out was not normal to them. 

Before I started being bad I was a straight A student, played sports year round and never caused trouble, but it seemed they were always saying I could do more or do better. One day I said fuck it, it doesn’t matter how well I do because it’s still not enough and just did whatever I wanted from then on. "
5) if both of your arms were injured from an accident...
How are you?
"The house I was being kept at the time was as well a very popular drug house, it ended up being kicked in by the police, I can’t explain it really why he would have held me there given the risk but he did, and only by that mistake I was saved.

I was very hostile and still afraid, in the hospital they told me I was kicking and screaming, I was sure that my father was in the room with me when he wasn’t I was hallucinating him being there, no men could work with me, even with women I was hostile and untrusting as well, thankfully I had an amazing team of very understanding, lovely nurses! I send them all thank you cards every year.  "
"Me too.  I thought everybody did.

It’s pretty annoying."
"Favourite would probably be my favourite regulars at the pubs I work often. 
They are some of the nicest guys I’ve ever met and a few of them have actually helped me out with things in my personal life a few times!


Least favourite for me would be the guys who take photos of me working and share them around without my knowledge or consent. If a guy asks (and pays) I am happy to let him take a photo with my neck and below (I wouldn’t let my face be in any, ever) but when they do it without asking I honestly see red."
Looks like you found the right guy. Good for you! 
Will one of the 100 real slim shadys please stand up? 
"I was never really allowed to go anywhere even monitored, but if there is an off chance that I would go out, it was harder being I was with my father. 
So literally if the cops come it’s not like i was with “ some strange man “ to them I was with my father so he could easily say we weren’t getting along at the time etc.

But warning signs are hard to spot as well because of how dependent the victims can become on their abuser, they can all vary on how much they will show signs. Some abusers will give their victims more freedom then others.
 
• being extremely shifty with their eyes and body movements obvious signs of being uncomfortable.

• they could also look extremely comfortable, but may have signs of bruises or cuts. 

It’s hard to say really, even writing this is frustrating because of the fact that most abusers will keep the victim very well kept.
&amp; any bruises would be where the public eye couldn’t see. 

•Sometimes the girl could be dressed extremely sexual for her age, even have sexual behaviour.
( which in this is hard because most girls in this day and age are dressed extremely sexualized) 

• if they appear to be bf or gf and the girl is way younger then the man, if you spot the girl in the early stage of sex trafficking you can see that most times she will look EXTREMELY uncomfortable, or maybe even slightly but it’s there. 
( again hard in this day &amp; age when so many girls are with older men but watch for the uncomfortable signs) 

The sad truth is even if you were to approach lots of the girls would defend their abuser in fear that something horrible would happen to them if they didn’t not realizing there was hope to be taken out of the situation, but sometimes the girl will give you signs that she is being trafficked.
If you can watch her but not let the man see, she may notice and mouth for help or make motions, again super hard to identify but sometimes it does happen where they will interact with you for help.

Also remember the girl could be in an extremely complex, dangerous situation. 
You could take down both their appearances, licence plate if you can any noticeable traits, scars, tattoos etc, and make a report.

Sadly even approaching them and try to intervene could make the girl get seriously injured or even killed.

It’s an extremely horrible, complex issue.
Each persons situation is different.

How old are you now? How did it feel first time heroin?
"Dont have a question, but go see the doctor ASAP.  I know a person with schizophrenia that went untreated by his parents for about a year. Over the course of that year I watched him go from Having no significant symptoms  to completely delusional. His parents refused to take him to the doctor and relied on religious convictions to cure him. He now has lost almost all real connection to reality.  I always wondered how it would have turned out if he had gotten help when his symptoms first started rather than after a year of progressive delusions and validation from his parents who thought he was possessed."
"I grew up going to church youth groups, because my father was Lutheran and mother grew up in an old fashioned Christian household, so for them it made sense to get involved with some sort of church. Not sure what kind of church it was, but we learned all about the stories in the Bible. Problem is, I was a very curious kid and if something didn't make sense to me, I would question it until I can make a connection with it. If I learned about dinosaurs in school and church said there were no dinosaurs, I'd start to think something was fishy.

I stopped going to church in high school and was Mr. Cringey Athirst for a while, until I dated a Lutheran girl. I enjoy doing things with people and for her, she wanted me to see her church. One quote given during the speech stayed with me to this day: ""just because God exists doesn't mean science is wrong, and science doesn't mean God doesn't exist. Science is a tool that God invented to help man better understand how his universe works"". That quote stuck with me, and led me in the direction of deciding that nobody knows what is out there, why the Big Bang happened, why we are the only place in the universe we know of that harbors life.

I'm not religious, but I don't say God exists or not. I believe anybody who says they have the answer is full of themselves and actually don't know much. I think it's nice to believe that there is something after death, be it heaven, nirvana, whatever, but it doesn't seem probable, but there's no way to know for sure. Long rant, but it's something I think about often. As a scientist myself, I like thinking about possibilities of there being some omniscient being"
"In what ways did your parents think you were ""troubled""?"
Are you a dog or cat person
"To be honest, it does sound like you need to work on those issues."
Did you get justice? 
"I hope you offer the drivers a warm beer or some counter cheese when they come. ""I'd offer you a cold beer but...my fridge is in your truck"".  
  
I once ordered a bed from Bob's and took the day off for delivery. When it didn't arrive by 5PM I called  the service line. She said ""oh, it was put on the wrong truck and will not be delivered until next week. I was supposed to call you. My bad"" MY BAD !?! Queue rage. I said some not nice things and asked her if she expected me to sleep on the floor for a week. When she didn't have a solution I told her I was going to come sleep next to her husband until my bed arrived. My bed was on the truck for the next day of delivery and I got refunded the delivery fee. "
"Please take a look at r/RaisedByNarcissists

"I have a 1 year old blue nose pit bull! I’ve had him since he was old enough to be away from his mom! But even then he still tried to feed off my fiancé’s nipple a couple times!
I love him so much i love taking him for huge hikes and spending time with him, he sleeps next to me every night and is super protective over me, he is definitely an amazing feeling of peace and comfort."
"It was scary. The two strangers who kidnapped me said I was being sent away, but my parents left the house as soon as the kidnappers got there to take me from my house. I tried calling my parents to ask what was going on and they ripped the phone from my hands and said that was not allowed. I didn’t really comprehend or understand quite what wilderness was going to be like. I honestly thought I would be gone for a week or two and come home. I was gone for almost 2 years. They really didn’t explain much of anything or really talk to me. "
"So sorry you had to go through that. 
How does this affect your sexlife? "
"I’m wilderness camp when you first arrive you’re not allowed to speak to anyone or interact with anyone until you’ve written your “life story.” Essentially this is everything bad or wrong you’ve ever done in your entire life. The counselors read over your life story and either say there’s more you need to add in or you’ve completed it. I was not allowed to talk to anyone for the first week and a half because they kept saying I had more to add in. 

Once you’re allowed to join the group essentially you learn different skills. They teach you how to do a bow drill to start fires, we hike everyday, etc. we would hike daily to a new camp site, and once we got to the site we would have to set up our site. This means we had to dig a latrine, hang bear bags in trees to keep our food safe, start a fire so we could cook at night, and find a place to set up our tarp (we slept under tarps at night.) 

There were different levels in wilderness and the higher level you were the more trust you had. Once you got to a certain level for example you could use a knife to sharpen your fire starting tools, or you didn’t have to count every time you went to the bathroom ( they made us do this when they couldn’t see us to make sure we weren’t running away or trying to force ourselves to throw up.) we would also give feedback to other group members and work on communication skills. Everyday we had some time for personal time to journal, or complete therapy assignments. We had therapists once every one or two weeks that we got to speak with. Mostly though we just would hike, and set up our camp sites. 

They would sometimes make us run drills. They would make us set up our entire campsite, break it down and pack it all up again, and if not completed in the required time we would have to continue to do it until we got it right. 

Boarding school was a bit different. 
We would wake up everyday at 5:45 and they would make us run the track and exercise, then we could eat breakfast and get ready for school from 6:45-8:00. Then we would have school until around 2:30. After that we had to participate in therapy groups until about 5. We would have dinner and then time for school work. We also had levels at boarding school. 

For example on the first phase you had to ask to come out of your room and be escorted everywhere in a line with the other phase ones. You couldn’t leave campus or speak to your family for the first 2 months. You couldn’t contact any friends outside of school. If you wanted to speak to another phase one, someone else had to be there when you spoke to each other to ensure you weren’t being shady. 

Phase 2 you could go off campus with your family, you could have a weekly phone call to your parents for 10 minutes. You still had to ask to leave your room, but didn’t have to line up to go everywhere. You were not allowed outside alone. 

Phase 3 you had longer phone calls and could visit home for 3 days. You could leave your room as you pleased as long as you announced it. You also were allowed to wear jeans on the weekend and after school as opposed to the uniform. 

On phase 4 you could speak to approved friends, have week long home visits, could have a phone call with a friend once a month. You were allowed to have a stereo in your room and could wear make up. You could also go on the field trips with our brother school to socialize once a month. 

Weekends we did therapy groups almost all day. We would have feedback group which was terrible. They would gather everyone in the school and people would tell you how they felt about you and what they thought. Often times you would end up called out in front of everyone and it was humiliating, then you’d have staff up your butt all the time and it could hinder your progress. You could be dropped down a level at any time if you messed up, even if you were scheduled to go home or something, if you got dropped they would cancel your trip. It was awful. And if they were ever suspicious of people they would do these huge groups called secrets group where people would rat each other out. It was terrible. There’s so much more to it and it’s so in depth it’s hard to explain without experiencing it. Sorry for the book of a response. "

$50,000 would be nice though.

"I mean it was better when I was at school because I had no choice but to talk to them. We did get closer in school definitely, but once I got out my mom would rub shit in my face like “you’re falling back into old patterns” when I was doing nothing unusual. She still acts like she doesn’t trust me at times and holds different expectations on me than she does on my brother, we currently haven’t been getting along very well, so it’s definitely been up and down. My dad passed away about 2 years ago, but our relationship was good because he didn’t look at me like a fuck up all the time. He would talk to me like an adult as opposed to someone who was still a teenager living under their roof. My mom still talks to me like she’s paying my bills and I’m a teenager even though I’m 27 now and on my own. "
"Definitely both, but I own three cats and they hate anything that isn't me, so not getting a dog any time soon unfortunately"

"I only know one other person with it, my mom hears radio broadcasters (can’t make out what they’re saying) in white noise. I actually enjoy it, unless I’m trying to sleep. But I can fix it by turning off whatever white noise there is.

Also, Did you contract any venereal diseases and if so, how do you protect your fiancé from exposure? I am aware of protection, but it isn’t 100%. This is already know, but what has happened to you is horrible. You are a strong person to be able to survive that and also to open up to questioning.

"Yes, I am just finishing getting my nail course! I have my eyelashes as well, I want to open up a shop for survivors and victims of sex trafficking &amp; abuse, it will be hair, nails, eyelashes, eyebrows, etc.

Someday I also hope to own a house where I open up the rooms for the girls who need a place to start to get on their feet, a safe place, with everything they need to start off.
Where I can offer to take them to any courses or support groups they need, it would mean the world to me to be able to be someone’s support, the one they can trust and help them get to where they need to be, believe in them, be there.

For most of them they looked extremely professional and well kept, like an average businessman.

I tried to block it out for the most part, many told me if i ever said anything I would be killed or that people simply would laugh in my face, 

I do remember a warden at one of our local prisons that I wasn’t able to realize until a couple years later which upsets me for him being in such power over vulnerable people.

as well as a doctor at a hospital, I moved far away so I would never encounter any of these people. Sometimes it’s hard to even leave my house here because I am worried to bump into one of them."

We have been seeing each other for a few months but he’s kinda said he wouldn’t officially date me as long as I do it, which I promptly ignored and continued working.

No I never saw any other victims, depending on where I was sometimes I heard other victims.

Yes, sometimes.
Certain men would talk about how they were good people but crave things their spouses wouldn’t give them, or that they weren’t bad for raping a young girl,
They knew it was rape because of how much they paid, I never was told the exact amount but sometimes I was beaten among other things, they would yell at me telling me that “ do you know how much I paid to do this I can do whatever I want to you”,
Some would cry, tell me they were sorry.

I enjoy reading allot, it helps take me away sometimes when I need it the most"
Thank you! I appreciate that!  yes I have spoken to my parents and I'm sure many people are gonna read this and think I'm really stupid for continuing communication with them but I do so primarily so I can stay in contact with my little brother (17) because I have attempted to go no contact with them before and they blocked me out of his phone and socail media until I started contacting them regularly again. At this point tho it is super low contact. I basically only talk to them when they contact me first and it's always only surface level conversation. 
"Money is my best guess, but no I would never ask I don’t want to know what makes someone sell their kid either"
"Like the others said it’s a way to control the victim, heroin is a drug that you get physically addicted to as well as emotionally, without it you get very ill, puking, shaking, feels like every bone in your body is breaking, hot and cold sweats at the same time,
At first I fought allot I would kick and scream I would scratch the men who would come and bite them, I think eventually he realized there would be no more customers and beating me didn’t do anything, 
So heroin was a way of controlling me, sedating me as well as when I would get sick from not having it he would promise me that he would make me better if I behaved, a couple times I fought anyways, but he would make me go through withdrawals for a day or 2 as well as being continually raped, so I never fought again.

I was 12 when it started 16 when it fully ended. "
If you could skip class what would you rather be doing?
"The worst was the man who raped me with several different objects he brought,  he had ED, and told me it was my fault, that I had to please him and make him feel good, I couldn’t stand after and going to the bathroom made me cry it hurt so bad.

"Seriously man- well fucking done. Sometimes I think about doing something like this but the huge fear I have about needles/ hospitals/ surgery makes me just forget it. Even when I actually needed surgery for a broken hand, I was so scared of general anaesthetic I got the doctors to manipulate my hand back into place with local anaesthetic, and it’s so messed up. The bones aren’t right. I should have let the docs do what they recommended and I literally couldn’t. For my *own* health.

Yet, here you are, voluntarily undertaking a huge operation, with all the needles/ drugs/ hospital shit they could throw at you- not for yourself, but for a total stranger. Wow. You’re amazing. You saved someone’s life... the epitome of selfless.

Holy shit that is terrible. It's like some sort of fasict internment camp. I'm so sorry you had to experience that.

What is your relationship with your parents like now?
"So I don't want to come off as though I wasn't financially provided for, because I was. Emotionally on the other than my life was miserable. My little brother was the Golden child while I was the scapegoat. I was essentially treated like I was incapable of anything for a majority of my life. They wouldnt allow any sense of privacy to an extreme sense. (Taking my door off it's frame for months at a time, tracking me everywhere I went, reading my diary, texts, and whatever else they could get their hands on) they didn't take me seriously when I told them that I was suicidal and my mental health was declining. They essentially told me I was being over dramatic and refused to get me any help (even after suicide attempts) and then when the police were called and I was taken to a psychiatric hospital, they acted like it was their idea to bring me there. ""oh our poor daughter who could have ever known what she was dealing with inside"" and then once in the hospital, every time they visited me it was them telling me that I was pushing our family into debt and ruining their lives (even though they take yearly trips out of the country). Essentially they gas-lit me at any given opportunity. "
"I joined the donor registry at an event at my college campus. Joining just requires doing a cheek swab. (There are some organizations, like Be the Match, that will mail the swabs to do this, free of charge.) A couple months later I got a phone call saying I was a potential match, and a blood test confirmed it."
"I’m unsure where exactly it slowly progressed, 
Some of his friends would come over and they would tell me how pretty I was they would get me to sit on their laps, and would rub my back for long periods of times, I believe I may have been molested by my father or different men when I was very young but I am unsure.

I assume one of his friends offered to pay a large sum of money for a night with me and that changed the idea to reality."

The more I deal with the things that happened to me, and come to understand that they are NOT the norm, the more I began to reclaim that part of me. I'm 27 now and in choosing my moments I can finally really enjoy myself, but when I was your age I very much felt the same way. You may be Ace, and that's perfectly fine too, but I used to have the same worries, so I felt it may help you to know. "
"Yes, I was already broken down severely and them doing that sometimes made me almost feel bad for them, almost wanting to comfort them even and tell them it was okay. 
manipulators are very good at what they do. "
"I was always told ""tell her, she needs to know"" and I just figured it was never my place and people only wanted me to tell her for the drama. However, when he was planning on his proposal to her I told him then I can't support him if he doesn't tell her (we had more contact then). He assured me that he would before they got married. About three weeks prior to me telling her, he texted me asking for my address so he can send me an invitation, so it was obvious he didn't tell her. I spoke with my therapist about not wanting to go and the fact that I was not going to and hope that would tip her off. (Before this, his fiance and I weren't super close and she always felt like I had a problem with her. I love her to death, I just have a hard time showing my real emotions and come across as a bitch a lot without realizing) he told me since she felt that I didn't like her, she would possibly think I wasn't going because of her and my brother would just run with that and say that was the case to cover for himself. Then that would make my life more difficult everytime I'd see them after the wedding because I would be ""that"" person that didn't show up even though I was there for the rest of it. Having me possibly be looked down on and revictimized. Second, I was fearful that they would have kids one day and I wouldn't be able to handle the thought of that. As well as the fact, she deserves to know. She took it as well as anyone could in this situation. Atleast when she's around me. We had a great conversation and we assured eachother that we are there for one another. I saw him once after they talked about it. It was at a family funeral and it was cordial, like nothing happened. I didn't expect any different. I'm a stubborn bitch and even though I'm also a pussy, he knows I'm not going to let him blame me for shit or scare me. "
Extra creepy because he wrote it in kind of a redneckish accent. 
"Absolutely! :) A short summary, it’s chronic facial pain that can be described mild aching to sometimes even burning. It affects mainly the Trigeminal nerve branches in my face along with having migraines headaches. Some daily activities like talking, eating, and talking worsen the pain. Pain killers don’t help at all. Usually this condition affects one side of your face but in my case, it hurts both sides. 
Any more questions, feel free to ask! "

"I filled out a questionnaire on the hospital website and they called me the next day to talk about it and schedule blood tests.

I'm not feeling too bad right now. Kind of like I did a bunch of crunches. "
"""If she cant deal with me when I'm upset maybe she should go"", is an absolute horrible attitude. Just cause someone's a SO, does not mean they have to put up with bad behavior. "
I just have some questions. 
"What type of symptoms are starting to surface? Are you on any meds yet? 

If you need some one to talk to I’m here. I’m 21 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia last year. It definitely sucks but you learn to live with it and it gets better!!! "

"I wish I could convince her of that, but I know she wouldn’t listen. I did have a therapist at boarding school who called her out on it, but the change wasn’t really sustained. I will definitely look into the subreddit. Thanks for the suggestion!"
"I have no idea what to ask, but I just want to say It's so awesome to hear you're doing so much better now, and you're out of that mess.

Wishing you absolute best"
Dollar dollar bills y'all!!!
No I was never told
"Why did you decide you do it? Was it more of a joke, a political statement, or just trying to get some money? "
"Be careful with this, man. I was in a similar situation last year. Ex stayed for a few weeks after the breakup until her new apartment was ready. I let her stay because I felt guilty at the idea of forcing her out without anywhere to go.

This compassion resulted in me coming home from my third shift job to a house missing stuff. She took various small appliances (toaster, coffee pot), clothes, dishes, towels. Basically anything someone needs at their new apartment. All of these things were purchased prior to us getting together, so it's not as if she took back her own things."

"I don't have any questions, but just wanted to say thank you.

My wife had leukemia first in 1995, and again in 1999.  The second time around a donor like you made her survival possible.  Our son grew up knowing his mother because of that gift.  I still have a wife, her parents still have their daughter, her sisters still have their sibling... it goes on and on.

Such a simple thing to do \- with just enormous benefits.

Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you."
My aunt had this. She committed suicide a few years back. I feel for you dear. Have you considered doing the ablation therapy? 
"I was nervous, so much so that I couldn't eat all morning. I'm not much of an outwardly emotional person, so I was worried about coming off as being cold hearted. My mind was racing and I didn't really know what to expect. And all of the emotions were compounded by the fact that we were meeting for the first time on stage at a special event in front of a couple hundred people. Fortunately, the nerves were washed away the moment I met her as I was hit by a wave of joy and excitement. "

"The way I see this, is a deep betrayal by your parents who give up on you in order to have control over you. 

They don’t care what you’re going through, the trauma you’ll have to deal with for the rest of your life, the daily humiliation and abuse you’re being put through, as long as they can control what you do, and even scarier, *who you are*.

I am sorry this happened to you. It is not OK and it is not normal. You are not a pet whose will needs to be broken for her own good. You’ve been hurt, badly. 

I hope you are able to associate with people who see he value and beauty in who you are, and respect your will. I hope you are able to get help to deal with the trauma, although I can imagine you don’t want to hear about another “therapy session” ever again. 

What you describe as “therapy” does not sound right. Therapy would never include humiliation or self incrimination or pressure to become someone else. Therapy is about healing, not control. What you were subjected to is insidious and definitely not healing. 

Lastly, remember that you were good and right to be the teenager that you were. You were right to rebel against the incessant pressure to be perfect. It is your birthright to be who you are and to live your destiny. 

Your parents are awfully confused, especially your mom. If she is ever able to see what she did to her daughter, she’ll never be able to forgive herself. 

See r/RaisedByNarcissists, you are not alone.

This is a common practice for traffickers. Lowers inhibitions of the victims and creates a dependence that the trafficker can use to manipulate the victims into cooperating. Most trafficking victims are exploited in numerous acts with several buyers multiple times throughout a day.
"They talked about it already. I haven't spoken to her much since and haven't spoken to him at all. So I don't know how things are now but we met up (me and her) and talked about it in person more in depth after she spoke with him. She was definitely angry, hurt, and sympathetic. She 100% was more concerned with me and apologetic towards me than anything. She doesn't feel like ""this is about her"" and I'm ""more important because I'm a victim"" but she's been lied to and betrayed and that shit isn't cool "

"Pretty much every girl I’ve worked with was either traveling or is doing it as a second job/while studying. 

I work full time through the day and am also doing an online accounting course, which means I can only work afternoons and weekends.

"I was raised by both parents, and lived at home until i was 20. My father was never abusive to me, and never lay a finger on me. He was very reserved and quiet and to himself. He picked me up from school and tried his best to be there for me. But i could tell it was hard for him and he would zone out and not talk to me for a few days until he was feeling better again "
I wonder how many people are missing out on this god tier meme
... this isn't a normal thing? always thought everyone heard it too
What was day to day life like in these places? 
"Yeah, riight..."
No not really. I had maybe one close friend at the time and my boyfriend who's parents weren't comfortable with me staying there regularly. I crashed on couches here and there during this time but having narcissistic parents conditioned me to feel like I was already a burden to those around me even before I became homeless so the idea of asking somebody to provide for me in that way felt selfish and rude I guess. Now looking back I see that I had people who probably would've helped me had I reached out more. 
U still sharing the same bed?
"There is zero need to keep your family informed about any medical diagnoses or treatment that you seek. If you think they're going to react poorly, leave them out of the loop. But not seeking help for what you believe to be schizophrenia because of your family's potential reaction is silly and dangerous. Take care of yourself above all else. "
"I have no sex drive,
I think if you were put through what I was you as well would not.
Or maybe you would I can’t speak for you!
But also don’t you think this question was extremely insensitive and disrespectful? Even if I was a guy why does that change anything? I’m a survivor of extreme sexual abuse, you don’t need to give anybody “sympathy” but to go out of your way to try and make someone feel uncomfortable is extremely disturbing.
Anyway hope ur life is good!  "

"It opened up communication while I was at boarding school because I had no choice really and I know my parents thought they were probably doing what was best for me, but I still at times have resentful feelings towards it.
