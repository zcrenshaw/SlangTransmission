"Strap in, boys.

First time I made out with my first girlfriend.  Had never kissed anyone before.  We were on the couch dry humping, and I started thinking of anything I could to stifle my boner.  She starts going at it harder, and I still stay soft.  Against my will.  By thinking about the Pythagorean theorem or some dumb shit. 

She finally leaves and then tries to break up with me because she thought I just wasn't attracted to her.  I was so confused and said I def was and she asked why I didn't get hard then.  I literally blurted out ""wait, girls like it when you get hard?""  OH GOD WHY?!

She said ""ummm... duh?"" and I turned red.  Luckily I somehow was quick enough on my feet to say ""Ohhhh, the last girl I made out with (who didn't exist) was creeped out by boners so I tried to not get hard as I assumed all women thought it was gross.""

She bought it.  But what the hell was I doing?!"
"After the movie frozen,  people were sending death threats because their kid NEEDED that specific Elsa doll or that specific dress. They didn't know it would be such a huge hit...  So they barely made merch. What kind of mother is willing to go to jail or prison over a princess dress the kid will destroy immediately, then throw away when the next fad cones along. 
I visited friends in the Bahamas, they promised their kids and other kids i was bringing mochimals... I'm like, well, I wish you didn't promise your kids before asking me.  But ok. How much can they be? Like 15 bucks? No. They're like 100 bucks and 10 kids are promised im buying it for them. If my boat was searched,  id def have to pay tax on them too. I said no. Im not spending 1500 on toys they're going to play with for a day.  these grown ass adults flipped out harder than the kids did. Like.  Flat out refused to hang out. The kids didn't give 2 shits. "
"Hey that’s me!

I get sleep paralysis pretty bad occassionally and see the same two figures: 

This old grey hag. That’s not a great way to describe her but really. She has this grey night gown on, this bad back hunch, normal hands but like long ass dagger like nails and she has like shark teeth as well. She slithers/slides on the walls into my room. Only if there’s an open door. Never seen her without my door being opened. And then she just stands over my bed until I snap myself awake. Usually involves me screaming a touch too because yeah it sucks. Been seeing her for like 10 years almost. 

And then this little girl, white hospital gown with a blood spot on her stomach. She’s not as often but occassionally with the old hag.

I’ve only seen them once while with a SO. Usually occurs while I’m alone and been sleeping poorly or had too much coffee combined with little sleep. Idk. 

Not so bad these days since I’m used to it and I can usually fully wake up fairly quick once I realize what’s up.

Aside from that I hike in non-haunted woods and work for an investment firm which means I’ll go to hell but def isn’t haunted."
