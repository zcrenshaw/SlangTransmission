"People prefer the term ""digital BDSM"".

Edit: holy karma batman. "
Don't most people ask people to roast them? Isn't this consensual cyberbullying?
"&gt; I challenge you to roast me...if you can.

Ahh, yes, one of these. Most people put a quick description of themselves in the title, or pose with possessions in the background to give us glimpse of their life. Material to work with, ya-know? But not you - you got all dolled up with makeup, a cute top, and meticulously groomed hair. You stood in front of a white wall to take take several pictures and picked the one that seemed flawless. To you, looks are the only thing worth roasting and you made sure to cover up any weak point. But you inadvertently revealed your true weak point - your personality. You gave us nothing to work with besides your looks because there *is* nothing besides your looks. You're the same basic 21 year old girl that plagues coffee shops and campus bars from UConn to USC. So I'd go ahead and focus on something other than taking Boomerang pics on Instagram with your girlfriends so that when you try again in a few months, we can actually roast *you* and not just the painted flesh and cheap polyester that surrounds you."
"cool, now you can disappoint men as well.."
"Because he took a 12 inch strapon with no lube

Fucking pay attention "
Bollywouldn't
Enjoy high school now cause soon you're gonna have to stay 500 yards away from all of them. 
Knock you down a peg? Can't afford to get your peg knocked off yourself?
You literally did not need to put any information in your bio I could tell all that from just looking at you
"""My daughter was bullied online!""

""But roasting is consensual.""

""What's Google going to do about this??""

etc..
"
When being transgendered is the most interesting thing about you 
"Honestly, after looking at you I think the alcoholism and drugs are the right decision for you. "
You look like literally everything you own has at least some jizz on it.
Your dog can pull a sled. You can't even pull a sorority girl 10 drinks deep.
Already started with her dad...
Not now that she earns $0.70 on the Dollar
You are going to disappoint so many lesbians when you reveal your secret dick.
"*Quick, hurry up and take the photo before my eyebrows grow back in!*"
The unfuckable Kimmy Schmidt
"Trust me, this isn't digital BDSM, I feel more degraded after a roast than with no lube and a twelve inch strapon."
Can we roast the media?
You put the ewww in LGBTQ
Anime scientist who specializes in underage pornographic holograms.
"Rule number 1 of Fight Club:

Donâ€™t send dick pics to everyone in fight club. "
You look like a tired single mother of three who works as a waitress and lies about her age to attempt to bamboozle some dude into falling in love with you but then you nag him crazy and he leaves and then the loop continues like you're in a sad romantic comedy type Groundhog Day movie minus the comedy and romance. 
"At first I was confused as to why there were no women at your family reunion, then after seeing the men in your family I understood why."
You're the kind of kid who thinks being an alcoholic stoner means you're mature and troubled but really you're just an angsty teen trying to pretend you're a big boy. 
"Wait you were a chick once? Good for you, OP. Pushing boundaries"
Class bio: *I'm a devout feminist who's trying to create artificial sperm!*
"It was only a matter of time. First it was fun, then came the Instagram whores looking for followers and now this.

Goodbye, it's been nice knowing you."
So many different shades of the sex offender rainbow here.
"Of course you're a virgin, 95% of 16 years olds are still virgins. However, unlike you they have at least hit puberty by then."
"I sure hope English isn't your first language. Not because you can't spell 'life' correctly, but because I want to have as little with you in common as possible."
Jerks off to pics of himself...calls it narcissism because he can't admit that it's actually gay.
You go to Reddit for attention
"Don't worry about the virginity. After a few years, when your breasts come in, there will surely be a drunk guy who wants to bang a half asian girl. "
I Bet they didn't know it was a dick
"No thanks, I just need to know if you're transitioning or not."
Yes we can.  Just be prepared for them being whiny bitches.
"Is it hard to find sunglasses with the right eyepiece significantly lower than the left one? Who am I kidding? With your skin pigment and red hair, you'll be outside in the sunlight about as often as you'll be in the feminine hygiene aisle at the drug store. "
Probably finishes him off as well. 
How do you know that exact feeling?
When you haven't told anyone you're transgender for ten minutes. 
More like a summer camp reunion with the camp counselor who gave you Zima and taught you all to masturbate 
"Guessing this isn't the first time you told a group of strangers to ""go hard""

Edit: this roast is all of my karma... thanks"
I would ask everyone here to leave him alone. So that he continues his drinking and dies of liver failure.

"Your utter sedentary sloth has left you hormonally-neutral and your puffy face without any indication that you've made any facial expression beyond opening your mouth wide enough for nutritionally void trash in five years. You couldn't even lift the fucking camera high enough to take a respectable picture. I don't see you following through with anything that your mother hasn't sloppily placed in front of you.
You're fed up with life because you actually believe good things are supposed to magically come to you without effort. By the way, effort is as simple as getting a haircut, moving more (preferably outside) and not nursing a preposterous oral fixation that accentuates your desire to be eternally attached to mommy's tit. Not doing any actual thing moral or constructive, that sort of gray-area laziness, doesn't make you a nice or deserving person, just in case you're wondering why no one likes you. You don't even know what you're supposed to be working toward, and for that I blame whatever absence of or sorry excuse for a father you have.

"How the fuck do you write a whole article about that roast and not include the crowning jewel?

""Your implants and cry for attention on here only highlight what you and everyone else already suspect... you are insecure.

Likely your insecurity stems from always questioning if you really ever earned anything by merit. Most people probably hand you things because they like looking at you. But that's made you vapid, shallow, and unable to perform in any way that adds true value in the world.

Your relationships are superficial. Your romance life always has the shadow of doubt. Does he love you... or how you look? If you were disfigured, would anyone give you a second glance based on personality?

That nagging feeling will keep you looking for validation. It keeps you in the gym. It makes you post photos online looking for praise or positive attention. It keeps you going back for a nip here and tuck there. Before long you'll look like Donatella Versace with the personality of one of her handbags. 

You'll shift from being the center of attention to being part of a gaggle of women who make rude comments about younger girls because you feel jealous and rude comments about men who no longer pay attention to you.

You'd be better served working on being a better person than hunting for attention on Reddit, but you'll likely die young and your grave will be about as shallow as your personality.""

"**Erotic humiliation**

Erotic humiliation is consensual psychological humiliation in order to produce erotic excitement or sexual arousal. This can be for the person being humiliated and demeaned or for the person humiliating, or for some spectator. It may be part of BDSM and other sexual roleplay or accompanied by the sexual stimulation of one or both partners in the activity. Humiliation is a subjective issue, and is dependent on context.

Your eyes make me want to tell 3PO to shut down all trash compactors on the detention level.
