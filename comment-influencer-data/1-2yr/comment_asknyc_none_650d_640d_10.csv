*Some* NYC natives who have never left New York can be just as closed-minded and limited in their world view as the transplants they look down on.
This is not normal 
I recommend cooking dinner in someone's apartment and avoiding all official New Years activities 
No.
"First off, some advice: when you're explaining your issues to people, do not mention what language they speak, your belief that they are ""undocumented"", the idea that their children are ""neglected"", or that they're in debt over gas or any of that shit. It's not your business and it could make people question how reliable your statements are. 

Instead, stick to the facts. Start keeping a notebook. Something like:

* Monday, Dec 4, 8AM - trash in hallway on way out for work
* Dec 4, 2:30 PM - kids left door unlocked for 25 minutes
* Dec 5, 7:45 PM - bike blocking door preventing safe egress

Get this shit together for a week or two and then take pictures of the log and send them to your landlord. Tell him that if he doesn't start doing something, you're going to start calling in the fire hazards and shit to 311. "
Not normal under any circumstances. 
"Cordless light blocking/filtering blinds for our bedrooms. Cordless means they look great without cords and go up &amp; down simply by pushing or pulling on the bottom tab with no strength needed, and the two tone means I can have them either all the way up (so I see outside), the first level pulled all the way down (which is light-blocking, great for sleeping in darkness) or the 2nd level all the way down (light-filtering, great for privacy but when I still want light to come in,) or any combination thereof. They were expensive, but legitimate blinds make apartment living a lot easier, particularly as I live on the ground floor. "
Youre walking from jfk to Jamaica station? Thats like an hour walk through the boonies and hood 
You should take the air train from JFK to Jamaica.
"Tel,her you feel extremely uncomfortable with her plan, especially since YOU will be responsible for the guest and not her. Tell her about common space and that that one are your belongings.

Point out what it says on the leae, and you don't want to risk evictions or nullifying get the lease because she didn't plan about the cost of the rent while she is abroad.

Yes it sucks, but and some point you have to be an adult.

"
Don’t get involved. There’s literally nothing YOU can do that will help other than moving.
"Walk as much as possible during daylight hours. Seriously, get those sun vitamins.

Go to a bathhouse and sit in the schvitz.

Go someplace sunny on the weekends, if possible.

Get laid."
"Go clubbing in the meatpacking district. Spend a couple thousand on bottle service, buy some coke from a stranger, hit on bridge and tunnel barflies, get in a fight with a finance bro, convince yourself you'll get into le bain, get turned away from le bain, uber back to connecticut in defeat"
"Contrary to what you see on Law and Order, Central Park is not littered with corpses of dead joggers. In fact, I haven't seen any dead bodies at Central Park. "
"Times Square is not downtown. We can’t tell you what the job market will be like when you come here, but anecdotally the chain restaurants in Times Square are supposedly easier to get a job at than higher end or independently owned restaurants."
"Not free-standing, but [Sylvan Terrace](http://www.scoutingny.com/a-hidden-treasure-in-washington-heights/) is pretty unique."
Jewish people do not proselytize to non-Jewish people. They are looking for secular Jewish folks to try to bring them back to the fold. 
"Most NYCers love to give directions.

I have lived here 30+ years but for some reason pulled out a subway map on the street to figure something out and within 10 minutes had 3 people walk up to me and ask if I needed help finding something."
"This. Especially college educated minorities with stable jobs or small businesses. It's like no, your authentic Turkish coffee shop with $8 coffees and expensive small dishes is not a bulwark against gentrification. Look at your customers. You shop at Trader Joe's, you pay thousands of dollars a month in rent, you pay others to do your chores, your favorite store in the neighborhood the new vegan ice cream shop, you are a gentrifier.

-child of gentrifiers"
"I mean, only the Grand Prospect Hall can make your dreams come true."
If I can’t eat it while walking it isn’t pizza.
"I don't think this town is nearly as left wing as people, both proponents and detractors, make it out to be."
Flying Tiger is great for inexpensive but useful knick knacks.
"They're called flowering kale - just decorative plants, like flower beds in summer!"
Fuck you. 
"Before you called the locksmith, you were supposed to call the landlord. Most people who own buildings in the city have a locksmith that they use regularly who will directly bill the landlord.

Neither a nor b nor c matter here. Anytime something is busted in an apartment, you should never go out and pay for it yourself. It should always go through the landlord.

That said, since you can't undo the past, the best thing to do is simply ask the landlord what they're willing to reimburse you for and hope that they offer you something. "
I think all NYers do. It lets us show off how well we know the city.  Which is as NYer as you can get.

"I'm going to assume you're not from the area.

JFK has a service known as ""AirTrain"" - it's a direct train link from JFK Airport to the Jamaica subway and LIRR station. It's about $5 IIRC.

The walk you are describing has you essentially walking parallel to the Van Wyck Expressway. This isn't an issue of ""Will I get mugged?"" but rather ""I make terrible decisions, I hate my life, and would rather walk an hour in concentrated pollution than spend $5"".

For Jamaica Station itself and the subway commute from there to Penn Station, it's usually pretty populated at all hours of the day, so I wouldn't worry too much. Just don't haul around LV luggage but since you don't have Lyft money, I suppose that's not an issue.

TLDR: Look into AirTrain from JFK; be normal on the subway"
"LOL
Move to the ghetto. Win ghetto prizes. I'm sure you've in thinking ""it can't be as bad as people make it out to be! These are good people who have a bad rap due to racism and unfair media!""

I’m one of those people who gets irrationally angry at this debate. I’m irrationally angry now.
I bought a portable washer that hooks to the nozzle in my kitchen sink. I also bought a cabinet to store it in the kitchen which keeps it hidden and gives me extra counter space. I bought a collapsible ventless dryer which looks like a coat rack with a clear tarp over it. It has a heater at the bottom and plugs into any outlet. The washer is a 1.5 cu ft Haier and the dryer is a Dr. Dry. Both available on Amazon.
"[This has been the single best piece of furniture I've ever purchased.](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10290221/)

We used it for thanksgiving, for when folks come over and play boardgames, for when my boyfriend and I want to play MTG with eachother (we only use half the table for that). And when everyone leaves or when we don't need it, we fold everything down and it's a nice console table. It's great quality, too, since it's solid wood."
"[Ramen Zundoya](http://zundo-ya.com/) on 10th and 3rd is my go-to spot, and they let you choose your level of broth fattiness from light to super rich. I find the light pretty decadent, so I can only imagine the gallons upon gallons of fat in super rich. I wish you and your arteries good luck."
"[121 Charles Street](https://www.brickunderground.com/live/history-of-121-charles-street) is my favorite, it's literally like a suburban house with a gated yard and everything."
"&gt; I like my landlord and don't want to strain our relationship

Why? He doesn't seem to care much about you or your relationship, and he certainly doesn't give a shit that your neighbors have the run of the building.

Honestly, unless you've got a particular reason to stay there, I'd just fucking move when the lease was up. Or wait for them to get evicted, or move when the gas gets shut off, or get arrested/deported when someone notices their shady shenanigans.

"
"For sure. 

People born and raised in the city always seem off to me. Even if it takes a little while to come out, they are bizarre people. And not in a cute way. "
"&gt; "" I'm visiting NYC, what should I do?""

""I like music and won't tell you what kind/feel if I want to go clubbing, I like food, but again I won't tell you what kind of food, just say ""good food"". I have a budget but I'll give you vague dollar signs to denote what I'm willing to spend. I will tell you that I'm looking for a hotel room for NYE in Times Square but won't spend more than $100/night. And I'm going to ask for your suggestions for hotels, even though most of the people who comment here live in NYC and don't ever really think about hotels"".


&gt; ""I'm moving to NYC, any advice?""

""Me and my SO and our 2 90 lb dogs and 3 cats are moving to NYC because I got a job. I'll be making 60k and my SO doesn't yet have a job but I'm sure they'll be able to find a server job at a high end restaurant, they bussed at Applebee's for a summer in college, so they know how to wait tables at a Michelin star restaurant. We have a budget of $1200/month (that's even more than what we pay here in bumfuck for an entire 2k square foot house!) for a 2 bedroom (non-negotiable, we have family who are going to crash on our couch and insist we play tour guide after we get home from work and are trying to relax at least twice a month), we're looking in Tribeca because we heard it mentioned as a cool neighborhood one time. We're flexible on location, it can BE EV or Soho or maybe even Chelsea but it's gotta be the perfect apartment for us to even consider Chelsea. And I'm not going to thank you for even reading this novel I wrote, so go fuck yourself!""


&gt; ""Why are all New Yorkers so rude?""

""I was walking through Times Square and stopped in the middle of the sidewalk to check my map and text my friend that I was checking my map and call my friend to make sure they knew I was checking my map so I could figure out where to go. Some asshole in a suit and briefcase bumped got bumped by my arm when I was gesticulating because I always wave wildly when talking loudly on the phone to my friend (not yelling, though, obviously I'm not a savage). He gave me a nasty look! Then I tried to grab his arm because I need this particular obviously in a hurry to get somewhere man to give me directions to the M&amp;M store I was standing under the awning for, but he brushed me off after I only said ""Hey man, nice suit, got somewhere to be? Haha, not me, I was just wondering, my phone isn't getting great signal and my buddy didn't text me back and when I called them, that's when I hit you, haha, well they wasn't too helpful and now I'm kind of confused, I want to try this thing, I don't know if you've heard about it, well, it's this...""! Ugh all New Yorkers are such assholes, what a terrible place, I feel bad for all you idiots who have to deal with that everyday, even though you know to ask cops or people not power walking in their business wear because they're obviously going somewhere for directions and be quick about it. Terrible!!



My favorite is ""Amateur photographer looking for unique places to take some pictures"".

""Hey, I'm just another asshole with a thousand dollar camera that thinks that makes me the next Ansel Adams. Let me into your office or apartment building and onto the roof, somewhere that might not even allow residents/tenants access, because you can see the skyline from there. Yup, I just want cool skyline pictures, even though that's not unique at all, but I'll make them unique because you, an internet stranger, will be letting me, another internet stranger, into your private place of work or your home! And no, I don't understand how ridiculous and potentially dangerous that request is, if you can to visit Bumfuck, USA of course I wouldnt ever consider letting you into my house because you like what you can see from the top of my house. That's weird. Maybe I'll offer to buy you a drink as thanks, but you have to actually take me to a bar that won't card because I'm only 19,"""
"it sounds like you are paying for the whole house and not your apartment. does con ed have the correct meter number for your apartment, is there other things connected to your meter?"
"Mexican here. I don't know about California, or the rest of the US for that matter, but most Mexican food I've tried here it's terrible.  I also don't consider Chipotle as Mexican food."
"You're probably going to chuckle to yourself when you realize how populated and safe Central Park is during the day. Have you ever seen the movie ""Enchanted?"" It's a lot like that, minus the musical numbers.

That said, I highly recommend a fully-charged phone, because while it seems like it's a straight shot across the park to get to the museums, it's suuuuper easy to get off track and find yourself wandering. GPS helps."
Still 1000000000x better than driving.
"Man, the *chutzpah* of some people... Keep us posted on this one please. I'm curious how she plans on having the place cleaned, sheets changed, etc between AirBnB renters. As suggested elsewhere here I'd contact AirBnB and put the kibosh on the entire thing now.

&gt; It would suck for her to have to pay for a room she's not living in

No, it doesn't. That wasn't part of the deal. Just because she can doesn't mean she should. I'm always amazed at how people describe who is and who isn't a ""good friend""."

"Once you’ve been here long enough, nothing is weird. Just annoying or not annoying."
Not normal!! There is a history of bed bugs JUST A FEW DAYS AGO as well as earlier this year!! And heat violations both this year (as recent as the other week) and last year!! Huge red flags.
"Yeah, this is a terrible idea. "
Go to your neighborhood places. Whatever bar or restaurant you'd go to on a regular not special night out is going to be doing something. Hit up your favorite spots. I stay local and with my favorite bartenders on the night and have never had a bad time.
