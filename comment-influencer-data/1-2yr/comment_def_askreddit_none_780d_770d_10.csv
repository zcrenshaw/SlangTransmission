"Bring somone else's mom to a highschool prom.

There is a group of friends. One of them Jake is quite funny, nice kid. His parents go through a bitter divorce. Rumors start coming that one of Jake's best friends Chris is actually banging Jake's mom.  No one could confirm, until Chris pulls the power move of bringing Jake's mom as his date. She shows up blackout. Grinding on all the kids. Getting more drunk. Gets them thrown out.

Names change for anonymity. Felt crazy bad for Jake. He was a junior. Had to live with that for a year. The funny thing is Jake and his mom's relationship has healed, saw them on FB together. I'm not sure I could ever forgive my Mom, def not Chris

"Yea, I agree. As I piss my erection def goes away. It's a great way to get rid of morning wood tbh."
"Still have yet to beat on hard.  Whats interesting is that the longest hard mode streak is 39.  That means someone won 39 times in a row using all the ships in a row.  Theres a lot of skill in the game, it just takes a long time to get good.

edit: link to the world record 39 runs in a row.  I posted it below in response to a comment that got downvoted a lot.  The streamer is Billy Kirby, an amazingly skilled streamer that I would def recommend checking out.
