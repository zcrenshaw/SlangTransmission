"I work with kids in an elementary school.

One day I was standing in front of the lunch room, and I had to make the kids form a queue in order to enter the lunch room. In order to prevent the kids from rushing inside all at once, i usually play games with them to make them wait. Things like rock paper scissors, and other silly games.

That day I was acting like I was the bouncer of this very exclusive nightclub called : ""The Lunch Room"" and I asked each kid to bust a dance move for me in order to get in. Obviously, everyone could enter but they had to shake their body a little bit.

All the kids were playing along, making fortnite dances, and other popular moves like the dab, the nae nae, etc etc etc ... the most shy boys could do the robot, and the most shy girls could take my hand and i would make them spin like ballet dancers.

At one point it was the turn of this shy girl, who slowly walked toward me, looked at me in the eyes... Then cried.

She was absolutely terrified of doing this in front of the other kids and just cried. I tried to confort her a little, so I picked her up in my arms, and took her hand like we were dancing a waltz, then spinned our way into the lunchroom. 

Later that day she came to see me and asking me to dance with her again. I sure did. I taught her how to dance the waltz (the 3 step thing) and she had a blast.

I dont know if OP wanted a story about little girls because they cry a lot. But it was to cute not to share...

EDIT : Thank you for all your kind comments ! i'm sorry I cant respond to all of you but I love you guys and thanks for the sweet words !"
"I'll answer a general question with a generalized answer, because there will be exceptions. Women are convinced men like pursuing and making the first move. Many men actually hate it, and it's likely for the same exact reasons that many (most?) women hate it. Rejection sucks."

"""Yeah you like that you fucking retard?"""
"I was too lazy to do the dishes so I took my box of cereal and gallon of milk.  

Took a handful of cereal, put it in my mouth, chugged milk. Ate the whole almost new box of cereal in one sitting.  "
"I think this is an unpopular opinion because I haven't asked any of my guy friends, but GOD do I hate long fake nails on a woman. They're just so ugly and tacky to me. Long finger nails is weird enough, but fake ones? They make girls look like witches, and they're super lame. Not even just long ones, fake nails in general.

It's not a deal breaker though. Just something at the back of my head I notice.

EDIT: First gold. Thanks bruh ‚úåüèæ"
"I don't HATE my job.  It's actually really easy and I feel way overpaid.

But God.  The monotony of routine.  The same office.  Same fake ""Morning!"" greetings and ""Hey buddy (because I totally don't know your name still after a year), how was your weekend I don't give a shit about but just don't want to stand making coffee in silence?"",  5 days on, 2 days off, 5 days on, 2 days off, until you're dead basically.

Sure holidays are great, but they're 2 weeks away, what, two or three times a year?

Then back to sitting in traffic, getting up at the same time every day, same lunches, same leaving time, same daily reports, same same same same.  Trying something new feels great and lasts a while, but you inevitably sink back in to the norm.

It's soul-crushing.

[Edit] To quote Trent Reznor/Nine Inch Nails from Everyday Is Exactly The Same:

""I believe I can see the future.  'Cause I repeat the same routine."" "
"I wrote a letter to my father in law, thanking him for all the help he has given us over the last few years, and how grateful we were, not just for us but on behalf of our 2 year old daughter. He's getting on, and I wanted to let him know that his influence will be felt throughout my daughter's life.

I asked my wife to read it before I sent it, and I guess I made her cry through my incredibly correct grammar and syntax?"
"-If he opens the door for you to the passenger side of the car, reach over and open his door when he's going around the car to get in.

-Unless it's really extreme and becomes annoying, make sure to acknowledge that he's treating you well (IOW, if he holds open the door for you, say ""thank you"", don't just walk in).

-Don't act like his possession, act like his partner.  Example: you're clearly into the whole ""he's a Gentleman"" thing, and that's great.  Let's say you were at a bar, and some guy came over and started hitting on you when he was away.  Don't just sit there and wait for him to come over and ""deal with it"".  Tell the guy you're with someone and want him to leave you alone.

-Sort of going along with the 3rd point, don't put the onus on him to make all decisions, start all communications.  Text him and ask him out, call him because you want to talk to him, etc.

Everything else is just being a basic good human being.  Don't ghost him, don't lie to him, don't take advantage of his kindness, etc."
Don‚Äôt have any advice but be prepared to stop frequenting this place if it goes south
When she asked if she can get you anything else say ‚Äúyour number.‚Äù  And then do the finger guns.
"By sneezing in the audience of her flute recital... i didnt know her, but my sneeze distracted her and she messed up. Cue the waterworks."
"When I was in high school I was moving to a different city and my friend was moving to a different state as well. 
Everyday I would show up at her locker at some random part of the day and scare the piss out of her. On my last day of school before my move as per usual I scared her but this time she bust out crying. I felt bad thinking I scared her pretty bad but she had actually looked forward to me scaring her at her locker. She knew it was the last time I would do it again and it was, considering we never went to the same school again. 
We eventually did come back to the same town again and we‚Äôre still the best of friends. :)"
Heavy fondling of balls. Be gentle with that shit 
"M48 here. Not a strange rule, I don‚Äôt think, but Dad always forbade is from going through Mom‚Äôs purse for anything, tissue, gum, keys, whatever. My SO sometimes asks me to get something out of her purse, and I refused for about the past three years but am now getting better at it. It still feels like I‚Äôm doing something wrong, even though she‚Äôs asked me to get something."

"Funny story about this. I couldn't receive my best friend's texts on my phone for months so we had to only text on snapchat. One day he gets so annoyed he grabs my phone with a long silence. Looks at me and says ""You have me blocked you fucking idiot."" I don't think I ever laughed so hard. "
"If we ordered food nobody could order the same thing as someone else. I still get a little weirded out when someone says ""That sounds good, I'll also have that""."
"Came in drunk with a pizza and a bottle of coke, spilled the coke all over the pizza, threw the whole mess in the bin.

Next morning, starving hungry, no food in the house, ate coke-soaked pizza from the bin, while absently mindedly brushing the ants off it. 

Edit: As this has gained traction let me just say:

1)The Bin was clean. I actually had the presence of mind to put a fresh bag in before I dumped the pizza in it. I'm not an animal.

2) I'm not in the least bit ashamed of this. Every man should experience bin-pizza at least once in their lives."
The fact that I have the power to just go out and do stuff without having to answer to anyone. No one can tell me ‚Äúno‚Äù when I eat a whole pizza in the middle of the night from my bed
"Unless you are positive she's into you, absolutely not.  It puts her in a terrible position because her income is based on pleasant interaction with customers and most women would not include ""having to shut a dude down"" as a pleasant thing.  So if she's not interested, now she is in an awkward position of ""do I say no and probably get stiffed"", ""do I say yes, ghost him and hope he gets the hint"" or ""do I say yes, hope it's not terrible, and doesn't impact my future work.""  That's a shitty position to put someone in.

If you really do want to ask her, be patient and feel her out.  Go in on an off night/time when there's time to chat.  If she gives you a cute smile, makes a little small talk, and acts like a normal waitress, she is definitely not into you.  If every time she drops your drink off, she lingers for 10 minutes talking to you, then maybe consider it.  You need to view everything through the lens of *she is literally being paid to be nice to you.*  If you go in 3 times and every time she is clearly going out of her way to chat you up, then I would say you could just ask her if she wants grab a drink sometime.  If she hesitates, immediately drop it.  And in that scenario, the most important thing to do is to never bring it up again and do not make it awkward the next time you go back, just act like it didn't happen."
"Her: I'll wait for him to call me. Guys like a good chase. 

Me: Damn. She hasn't called or anything. She must not be interested. 

If you like someone, just let them know. We're not mind readers and we don't like chasing you. We're adults. Not high school students. "
"Start small. Something along the lines of, ""You get me so hard"".

If there seems to be a good response, gradually escalate it. Dirty talk covers a very, very wide range. 

I'm not comfortable typing out the furthest end of that spectrum, even as an anonymous internet person... I've heard some dark shit. "
"I came home to her place, drunk and sad. I started crying and so did she. When she asked me what was wrong I looked up at her and said ""I don't have a motorcycle and really want one"". 

She thought I was breaking up with her so I slept on the couch that night."
"Had a girlfriend for 6 months, everything was perfect. However she went to Japan to study and I went to Switzerland. When she asked what should we do I said it was better to end it there. She cried, I didn‚Äôt.

Last week I cried in my room because I realized how my current girlfriend isn‚Äôt as nearly as awesome, cheering and encouraging."
She can leave you alone and her life doesn‚Äôt revolve around you.

"My step dad used to yell at me all the time for ""walking too loud"" I wasn't big or rowdy or anything. I was just a teenage boy. They make some noise. But the only time he didn't yell was when I would walk on the front of my foot, almost like tip toeing. After a couple years it was habit. Now, even after I've been living way away from him for a couple years I still walk on the front of my foot when barefoot. If I walk ""normal"" it almost feels like I'm slapping the ground. In shoes it's okay. But when I have nothing or just socks then I will be on the front of my foot. "
I've never personally worried about it because sex doesn't have to end because I came. Sometimes I just need to fire off a round to decrease my sensitivity. No big deal. There's other fun to be had if I need some time to recover.
"When both of you have your own independent goals and aspirations but have a ""teamwork"" mentality towards achieving them. There's nothing quite like having your own badass personal cheerleader by your side as you tackle life's obstacles.

Speaking from past experience, if someone wants success only for themself and doesn't push you towards becoming the best you, that person is unlikely to be emotionally invested in the relationship through the hard times. "
It's kinda nice not being a fucking idiot anymore.
"Should be noted that anything you may have percieved as interest on her part can easily be misconstrued as, ""me being pleasant to you determines how much I get paid."" 

Good luck, thugger."
"A very beautiful girl in my class (9 years ago, 2nd or 3rd grade) openly said she was fat (she was not). I said she was not and we got into an argument and I ended up agreeing (because the argument was going nowhere) and said she was fat. She cried and I was made the villain...  To this day its one of the most important lessons I've learned in school"
"We went paintballing for a stag do, my little brother decided to wear a white hoodie which made him easy to spot so we all targeted him in the game because he was an idiot for wearing a white hoodie for running around the woods.

Unknown to us, a pre-teen girl who joined later in the session was also wearing a white hoodie. We all ended up targeting her and unsurprisingly, she got upset."
I wear long fake nails so that I look more like a witch. So I am happy to hear this. My boyfriend doesn't like them either but it is more important for me to be witch like. 
"The Delivered food that could feed a family, followed by the yell I make into the house to notify ‚Äúthe family‚Äù that suppers ready.

No one is allowed to open their presents on Christmas Day until everyone is in the room and nobody can open a present when someone else is (unless my mum knew it was the same thing she‚Äôd bought for all three of us kids) the same happens now with my son and nephews and even my parents and siblings. We had to make sure we appreciated and thanked people for every gift which I don‚Äôt think is a bad rule :) Christmas morning takes forever though! We sometimes have to break it up with a walk as there are a lot of us!
I can barely get myself a girlfriend 
"A woman on bumble kept taking days to respond, she was very vague about wanting to meet.

Then i get a message from her saying ""are you just looking for a pen pal, i see no initiative from you""

And im like ""you can ask me out, give me your number make plans too, isn't that yhr point of bumble give women more power and control in dating""

To which she replied ""i dont ask guys out, sending the first message was already too much for me""

I gave her my number and said ""text me"" then she just gave me hers.

She seems stuck in the old mentality of men ask first and that's not my style in 2018. I tend to ask first when i feel ""if i dont ask fast ill lose my chance"" if im busy or have shit going on i wont ask. "
"The answers in these threads usually have a lot of overlap with the ones in askwomen about subjects they wish men shouldn't comment on.

Men say ""We don't like fashion trends X, Y, or Z, they look silly.""

and then there's a corresponding thread

Women say ""We're not wearing X, Y and Z for you, ok? We're wearing it for ourselves. Stop criticising."""
You fucking inconsiderate bastard. 
"Woman here. For me, nothing turns me on more than hearing how HE‚ÄôS feeling as opposed to what he says about me and my body. 

‚ÄúYou are making me so hard...‚Äù
‚ÄúI love when you kiss me here...‚Äù
‚ÄúWatching you do (blank) is turning me on...‚Äù

Etc. 


I love when men are audible. Moaning is the sexiest thing to hear from a guy in bed. Let her know what feels good! Take her body in. When a guy looks at me with fire in his eyes while I‚Äôm going down on him, straddling him/etc. it makes me feel incredibly sexy. 

I‚Äôm not a huge ‚ÄúYou want me to fuck you?‚Äù (Umm...obviously yes, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm naked with you) or ‚ÄúYou like my hard cock?‚Äù Kind of girl. That talk seems cheap to me, and overplayed. Really connecting with your body and expressing exactly how you feel is way more genuine and makes a better experience. 

I guess all women are different, you just gotta play around with what works! "
TIL my friends and I are the only ones still using ordinary texting as a primary means of communicating 
Fries that were supposed to be baked but I was too lazy to bake them so I just microwaved them. They were somehow soggy and dry at the same time and still cold in the middle.
"this isn't a sexist thing or a chauvinist thing but....

cook for me...

honestly, my wife won me (like, I've GOT to marry this girl)  the first night we had dinner at her place.  ""just come over, i'll take care of everything"". 
 
She's a very very good cook, but she went the extra mile and learned how to make an obscure dessert that I had mentioned, possibly a year earlier that i really liked.  

there is so much love and warmth you can express by cooking for someone.  

so, yeah, married 33 years now.  well fed every day.

"Not too strange, but I was always taught to refer to people older than me as ‚ÄúMr./Mrs. _____‚Äù.
Now I‚Äôm an adult and my boyfriend‚Äôs parents insist on me calling them by their first names which makes me so uncomfortable.

"Because every time I do he fucks it up somehow. Dude is objectively handsome, good job, own place, and isn't a weirdo. Should be a slam dunk, but he always fumbles it. 

Seriously, the last girl asked me if he was autistic."
"Being kind, attentive, and not expecting to be treated like a princess from the start. A date shouldn't be the guy doing all the work, especially if he was the one to put himself out there by asking her out first. Being willing to pay for herself, offering date ideas (this can be stressful for a lot of guys), and contributing to conversation are all nice too."

""" I do not worry about my career. And they said, ""Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you're making fun of the victims, and that's wrong."" But that's not what I'm doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I'm wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever... No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, ""Hey, are we trending?"" No. This is who I'm making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: ""My thoughts and prayers..."" ""My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora."" ""My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston."" Do you know what that's worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, ""Don't forget about me today.""""

"Dude, you have to make happiness in your week. Vary your lunches by week even you can't by day. Call a friend. Buy fancy ice cream on a whim. Spontaneously see a movie. Explore a street. If you do the same thing every day, yeah life can be soul crushing. "

"My family was super strict about hygiene. Twice a day I had to brush, floss, mouthwash, wash my face with a scrub, shampoo, condition, body wash, pumice, and moisturize. It was later in life that I found out doing all this twice a day every day is actually terrible for your hair and skin. I still can't go without showering twice a day cuz I feel super gross getting into bed and going out, but I've gotten better about not using product every single shower. On the plus side, 31 years and I've never had a cavity or crown.

Edit: my much more body friendly routine is now brush twice a day, floss and mouthwash once a day, and I shower on a two day rotation: morning 1 water only rinse, evening 1 body wash, morning 2 face wash, evening 2 shampoo and conditioner. I'm very oily so that's why I still shower twice a day, but definitely not necessary if you have dry skin."
"Considering that Snapchat deletes your text history each time you exit the app, I don't understand why anyone would even text through it in the first place. I'd send something, then later read their response, and I'll forget the context of the conversation."

"When I was like 5 my little sister used to slap me really hard and then start crying saying ""Moooooooom, u/trigger93 hit me!!!"" Mom would hear the slap and the crying and I'd get in trouble.

"This will probably get removed as an FAQ but I'm going to have a stab at it anyway. First, you're 27 - you'd be surprised how many men start to turn their lives around at that age. A lot of rock stars seemed to either die or get clean around that age. You haven't done nothing, there's still a perfectly good chance you can do well from here. 

- Social anxiety. This is the big demon you're going to have to face. [This is how.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8GSf5cYCvE) You need to go out and find people to socialise with. A lot of guys make the mistake of only going where there are hot girls, burning out and the saying ""well I tried."" No, go anywhere and talk to anyone. I suggest you volunteer in your community, make your talents available for those who could use them. It will lead to more social opportunities that you might expect.

- Fitness is hard to get into, emotionally more than anything else. [Here's how I reccomend ] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/8bfuiy/how_to_gym_for_the_first_time/dx6dsnf/?context=3) that you approach it. Also, [autosuggestion] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNJTf2Sv3AY) can be a powerful tool in changing your self image - which is a major problem for you right now.

- The number of women you have slept with is irrelevant. We guys like the simplicity of numbers and scores, but it's hard to quantify things like intimacy, generosity and quality of sex. Quality over quantity is easy to say, but hard to believe in - especially when it comes to sex and women. If your self worth depends on fucking a large number of women, then you're doing it for the wrong reasons - validation will never plug the hole. If you just like the excitement of novel sex but don't feel depressed when you're not getting it, then casual sex is for you. Otherwise you should focus on building a relationship that's going to be high quality and reciprocal, by investing in someone with potential and working hard to build a good partnership that will give you the connected stability that you need to thrive.

- Your job is too isolating. Look into hot desking or shared office space, at least that way you'll be around other people while you work. I do that, and it's made a massive difference to my mental health, otherwise I'd be at home by myself lonely while working which isn't very stimulating. Hell if that's too costly then just write in Starbucks, they position themselves as a Third Place and you'll still be around people. I am much more productive around people, and I can still go home if I need some peace. You don't make enough money though, and I'm guessing that your writing doesn't really take more than 20 hours of actual work per week with a fair chunk of boredom and procrastinating inbetween. If you have IT skills, there are lots of things you could do to fill up the remaining hours in the week and make more money. You'll feel better for being busy.

So to summarise, you have no real goals, you are lonely and unmotivated and your career isn't fulfilling. Set S.M.A.R.T goals, get out of your house and practice socialising, find more work and really throw yourself into it and start taking better care of your health by starting simply with diet and workouts. 

I was earning not much more than you at 27, and I was nearly 300 lbs. I'm now 31, own a house, have a thriving small business and have lost well over 100 lbs and gained a lot of muscle. You can do this mate.

"It was the general rule in my house, no looking into someone's purse, backpack or drawers. It involved everyone, my mom would never go through my stuff.

"When I was younger I made my mom cry so hard.

I think I was 15 or 16 and went to Subway, got a large sub, I think it was meatball marinara, anyway. i took it home and saw my mom sitting on the kitchen as I made my way to my room. She looked sad and I asked her what was wrong. She said everything was fine and then I went to my room to eat my sandwich.

After I was done I went to the kitchen to throw away the paper and saw my mom crying. I asked why and she said ""Because you didn't bring me a sandwich!""

She was pregnant at the time..."

"My ex-wife would cry every time I said ""No"" to her requests to go out to eat every night.

To be clear, I didn't say no every night - she would *ask* every night, even after we'd already talked about money being tight earlier in the same day.

Turns out she wasn't just emotionally manipulative (though she was definitely that), but genuinely couldn't understand money. She eventually opened a credit card in her name and added me as an authorized user, which she actually thought made me responsible for it. I let her keep thinking that until the divorce was finalized.

I know this probably isn't what you were looking for, but it sticks out in my memory the most. It sucks that now any time someone cries in front of me, there's a tiny part in the back of my brain that thinks they're trying to manipulate me. "

"Right after my Ex left I rolled the fatest, longest Blunt I had ever made in my life.

I watched 6 Disney films that night starting with the lion king and ending with frozen probably the best night of my life. 

My best mate heard the news came round to check on me. Joined me mid way through Lilo and Stitch stayed for the rest of the night. "
"you can't over-analyze this stuff. any of it will sound stupid if taken out of context. point is to say it with conviction and not to doubt yourself needlessly. you're just having fun. few of these things are said as dry, factual statements. it's like role playing. you're essentially creating a ""scene"", an atmosphere. ""you feel so good"" is a perfect thing to say, ""put that wet pussy on me"" can be OK as well. maybe just allow yourself not to judge what you're saying, but let your more passionate side take over and fuck what it sounds like after you're done. cause, like, who cares? she thinks it's hot and gets aroused. that's it. there's not more purpose to it, really. other than making her feel desirable, which is very valuable. so just see what works for her and if it works, maybe, who cares about what it sounds like afterwards?"

Finally she cornered me while I was smoking outside of my second job and demanded to know how I could be so lonely (I wasn't) and have so little sex (mostly true) and not want her?

So I told why. I told her every mean thought I'd had about her for four years, I vented a lot of unrelated frustration as well but dammit I wanted her gone and the police weren't an option. I'm not gonna lie, I said very cruel, very true shit and I really thought I went to far when she drove off going 100+ in a 40.

She broke down, hugged me, said goodbye, and we parted ways. We've never spoken since. I still don't know if she was hurt because of what I said or if she was just sad to see me go.

Plus, I‚Äôve dealt with the alternative, a man who took forever (two hours)to finish. I thought he wasn‚Äôt attracted to me or I was doing something wrong. That‚Äôs a far more frustrating. I was really tight (humble brag, but this also seems to contribute to my boyfriend finishing fairly quickly), and it hurts to have sex for a long period of time. Ten minute sessions are totally fine for me.

Years ago I met a woman went to dinner then back to my place we had sex several times that night.  We woke up and I cooked her breakfast (pancakes, sausage, etc).   She eats then stands up and angrily says.  ‚ÄúI never been treated so poorly in my life... don‚Äôt ever call me again‚Äù

I was stunned.  In every respect it was a great night for both of us and a good morning.  I played everything over in my head and couldn‚Äôt think of one thing that she could have been mad about.  Finally I thought well, I guess she‚Äôs just crazy.

About a week later I get a long email telling me I‚Äôm not a man because a ‚Äúman‚Äù would have pursued her to find out what was wrong, etc, etc.  she then again said to not contact her again.

"People typically downvote the sort of thing in about to say, but for many men it‚Äôs sincerely biological. A man can feel immediate active disinterest in sex immediately after ejaculating.  For me personally it can be pretty bad, like I love my wife but immediately after busting the disinterest can be overpowering which honesty is almost scary st times because this is a person I love and I think is insanely sexy. And yet it doesn‚Äôt matter. 

Now of course, there are times I push through this with a smile  to help please my wife.  But it can almost feel like I‚Äôm lying because I am so physically disinterested for the first 10 minutes.

On the flip side, I've never watched a Saturday morning cartoon in my life, despite really having wanted to see an episode of that Kirby cartoon.

Top 10 Questions r/niceguys Still Can't Answer
"&gt;
I recommend the¬†backpack test. Both of my children agreed to this, and it appears (so far) to have worked 
successfully for them.
&gt;
The basic idea is this: for a marriage to last, the partners need to recognize that there will be periods of intense stress, non-romantic moments (often lasting days or longer) when life gets tough. It could be illness, or lack of money, or just something serious going wrong. Maybe a flat tire. Maybe you arrive at midnight at the cabin you rented and you discover the key doesn‚Äôt work. How will you and your partner-to-be handle it? Will you work well together? Will your love continue despite the stress?
&gt;
Take a week-long backpack trip together. Or do something equivalent. I like backpacking because doing it, particularly in Yosemite or anywhere in the Sierras, is a wonderful exhilarating spiritual experience. But‚Äîand this is the key‚Äîit always has moments of stress. It may suddenly rain, and you get unexpectedly wet. Maybe it will be cold in the morning, and you (or your partner) will not want to get up to fetch and heat water. One time it snowed suddenly, and we couldn‚Äôt find a sheltered place to camp. Maybe one of you will develop a blister. Maybe one of you will feel that you would like to transfer some weight to the partner. Maybe you will get lost. Maybe a bear will steal your food. Maybe one or both of you will get very tired, and grumpy.
&gt;
Before you get married, you want to experience stress together, ideally over an extended time. A few days is minimal; a week is better; a two week trip is probably more than enough. I recall taking such a trip with my wife-to-be, and a good friend and his wife. I was appalled at the way he treated her. When her pack was uncomfortable, he told her to endure it until they got to a good rest spot. (My wife and I insisted we stop until her pack was comfortable!) He didn‚Äôt help her in the cooking. He just didn‚Äôt seem to care. After that trip, I could never again think of him as a good friend. And indeed, a few years later, he and his wife were divorced.
&gt;
Don‚Äôt go backpacking with casual friends you want to keep. You may grow to dislike them when you see them under stress, and then you will not even want to be casual friends with them. That was my experience in the trip I just described.
&gt;
It doesn‚Äôt count to go on a romantic vacation, staying at hotels that take care of all your needs. A day trip isn‚Äôt good enough. You‚Äôve got to experience extended stress; even better if the stress is unexpected. My bride to be and I went on several backpack trips before and during marriage. Perhaps the most dramatic one was a two-week trip that had rain, snow, terrible blisters, discomfort, bears, and all sorts of stress. We came back from that trip loving each other much more than we had imagined possible

"Girls who think that men only want sex, play video games and want nothing else to do with themüòí"
"1. *Independence*. It's actually very reassuring for guys to know that we don't have to lead a woman like a lost puppy or that they don't need constant text updates. That being said, it's such a turnoff when it feels like a girl is being difficult or oppositional for no good reason. That's what makes guys walk away and only bother with a girl if she's a sure thing. 

2. *Being a loud and crazy party girl.* Most guys like a girl that likes to have fun or is outgoing. What we don't like is feeling that a girl is a massive attention whore or has ADD or where it's a struggle to hold her attention. It also makes us doubt whether a girl is relationship material if she's all about da club and getting dolled with her girlfriends to soak up male attention.  

3. *Using sex as a relationship tool.* To most guys, sex is an end in itself, not a means to an end. There's nothing that turns a guy off a girl faster when it feels like she's using sex as a carrot (and often stick as well). I've flat out turned down girls who were promising no-holes-barred sex because I knew it wasn't about the sex, it was about getting stuff (attention/a relationship usually). 

4. *""I don't know what do you want to do/wuu2""*. We guys get it. A lot of girls can't be bothered deciding where to go to dinner and it's nice to delegate those minor decisions to a guy. But it can get awful grating when a girl is just sitting there expecting the guy to lead all the fuckin time. Believe it or not, we don't mind girls expressing their likes and dislikes. We might not defer all the time (and you might not want us to) but it's nice to know that she's not always waiting for us to make up our minds. 

5. *Making us jealous.* A lot of girls seem to think this works with guys, or it's useful for getting our attention/making us act. With me at least, it's an instant turnoff. It's too obvious and manipulative and it makes me just want to pull up stakes. It doesn't make me come closer, it makes me pull away.  

Honorable Mention: sloppy gaggy blowjobs. I'm one of those guys who prefers the subtle approach and a deft tongue, not the ""she sounds like a duck and I'm worried she's gonna hurl all over my crotch"". "

That a lot of time passes while in the relationship.
"It‚Äôs mental how many guys think you have to go in and out with the fingers... doing that is going a really round about way to making a girl climax and is likely getting her red raw.

Hook those fingers at 90+ degrees, put them in up to the second knuckle, boom, should have the G-spot (feels rough and swells slightly when a girl is stimulated). Then play that shit like a DJ, i.e. lateral movement to start and get the blood/juices flowing, the G-spot can take some serious pressure and powerful stimulation if you get it warmed up properly. Then you start with the ‚Äúcome to me‚Äù beckoning movement. You finally move on to up/down and back/forth pulling (imagine South West to North East from side on) and increase force at a reasonable rate. Finally you can put your hand on the ‚Äúmount‚Äù and might feel you fingers coming up, push down on that when climax is near. 

Note, the above is equally effective anally, just x3-4 the warm up phase. Anyway, good luck my friends."

"Whenever I had to split something with my brothers (a can of soda, last piece of cake, etc) the rule was that whoever did the dividing was last to pick their portion. To this day I am meticulous in making even portions."
"Not quite my household, but similar idea. When I was younger, I used to, for lack of a better word, ""babysit"" a kid my age with autism. He could speak and do tasks he was familiar with, but his thing was that everything was routine, he always did things according to a pattern, and if that pattern was broken, it was like skipping a line of code in a computer: ""Does not compute"".

One of the things that he always did was that every time I would leave the room to use the bathroom, he would ask me where I was going. Every time I had to leave the room, without fail, as if he was worried I was abandoning him. So I got in the habit of saying, whenever I was going to the bathroom, ""I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.""

Still to this day, if I'm with someone else and need to leave the room, I sometimes automatically say ""I'll be right back""."

"&gt;Y‚Äôknow, and I feel like I was born in 1990 and I was sort of raised in America when it was a cult of self expression, and I was just taught, y‚Äôknow, express myself and have things to say and everyone will care about them. And I think everyone was taught that, and most of us found out no-one gives a shit what we think.So we flock to performers by the thousands ‚Äòcause we‚Äôre the few that have found an audience, and then I‚Äôm supposed to get up here and say follow your dreams - as if this is a meritocracy?

- (grab her by the wrists and put her hands behind her head as she lies on her back) + again, ""you're not going anywhere, you're all just mine now...""
- whose girl are you? who do you belong to? ... that's right, just mine. ... just for my pleasure
- have you been a good girl? ... I guess I will have to punish you a little more
- god, I love your lips/thighs/...
- (with a cheeky tone)... oh yeah, you like that? would you like me to ..... ? (she nods) oh really? is this what good girls like? hmmm, I wasn't aware... is this good?

Point is to be playful and a bit over the top,, at least in my experience. If she's into that, combine with a little show of dominance, like light choking, spanking and such and it gets her going pretty good in my experience. But the main point is, check with her how she feels about it. But I wouldn't be too shy either. I think she'll let you know if it's too much.

I dated a girl who was more ""edgy"" and who enjoyed it if I called her my little slut and such, but for me, that actually isn't as pleasant after a while. Another thing I did with her was a kind of roleplay. Essentially, you describe a scenario, like she was into history, so I'd talk about a warlord conquering an opposing tribe and taking their princess as his trophy. And even though she despised him, she couldn't resist... etc. Like describing bits of really poorly written erotic literature. But it worked and was fun, so oh well. "
"I agree, when I first started working 9-5 I hated it and was ready to run far away, but then I realized that all I was doing outside of work was playing video games and sleeping. The weekends were basically the same thing.

It's a lot less soul crushing if you mix things up and actually do shit during the time you have off. Set some goals for yourself outside of work, travel, exercise, go see concerts and take weekend trips, learn to play an instrument, teach yourself a new language.

The reality is that 99% of people aren't going to ""love"" their jobs. The overwhelming majority isn't going to continue working if 10 billion dollars appeared in their bank account today. It becomes a lot more tolerable if you *make the effort* to create a meaningful life outside of work with the time that you have."

"""Don't stop dating your wife. "" - Chris Rock

Just because there's a ring on the finger doesn't mean you stop planning nights out together. "
Right?  I'm sick and tired of carrying my girlfriend.  She wouldn't even be considered for this clan if I didn't beg to get her in.
"Female. I agree with this, especially the finger blasting.  From my limited experience, it seems that guys think that just aggressively jamming their fingers in there will do the trick. No, just no. "
"Some women think men like ""curves"".  Some men do, I guess.  Most prefer fit women."
"The realization of how fragile things are. When you're younger, you think that your family is always going to be around, that your friends will always be your friends, and marriages will stand the test of time. But people get sick and pass away. Friendships drift apart. Divorces start popping up everywhere. 

Obviously it's not all doom and gloom, and lasting connections do exist if people make an effort. But that sense of security you had as a kid is chipped away at repeatedly as you grow up. "
Realizing that you were the one who was wrong is a pretty positive sign though.

I dont know if this is would be considered strange for others."

"Snapchat texting is the most annoying thing in the damn world. Yeah you can tell when someone reads the message, but often people don't save the conversation and I often forget what was discussed.

"Fellow educator here, that warmed my heart."

With sadness? I told her that I needed to go away (""for a while"", fucking lie that was) because we'd decided things weren't working out. She wanted us to go back to being just friends, but I just couldn't and seeing her back with her ex-boyfriend (Now fiance, I believe they're getting married in the next two months) just made me feel like human garbage.  "
"I have ptsd from my ex wife kidnapping my kids to another country.  Legally there was nothing for me to do.  She had an affair while i was deployed and rather than own up to it and settle things amiably, she kidnapped my kids after having me charged through the military.  All charges got dropped but it‚Äôs been years and I‚Äôve given up hope trying to find them.  Now girls just want to settle down and have kids with me and I can‚Äôt bring myself to trust her with driving my car.  Im in intense therapy for this and its even hard for me to have sex anymore because I miss my kids and my ex wife tried and failed to do rape charges (bc I was deployed when she said it happened and she refused rape kits).  

I did try to kill myself after a year and a half of the false charges and bc the military has so much documentation of how great of an officer and my ex kept getting caught lying to courts and police, I ended up with a full medical retirement at 38.  

I now spend most of my days gardening and praying that I can find my kids when they turn 18.   My live in gf knows everything and frequently holds my hand when I start throwing up or have a panic attack bc I see something that triggers memories of my kids or of the horrible things my ex accused me of."
Well curves originally meant someone with a hourglass figure which is still considered the ideal. However it's mostly just code for obese now at least on Tinder.

"Um.... I guess I'll just say what my wife does that I really enjoy.

* Shows up to my work on her days off and we spend my lunch break going on a walk.
* Sometimes she wears this dress I really like and a girls newsboy hat that I know she hates, but bought for her when we first started dating.
* She reaches out for hugs when I get up for the day. Every morning I get up, get back and hug, then get back up.
* Sometimes she makes me coffee on weekends. She sometimes fucks it up, but she tries.
* She demands hugs and kisses, all the time.
* She waits in the car for me to walk around because she knows I like helping her get out.
* Sometimes she makes dinner, like, once every other week, and acts like it's the most special thing in the world. Even though...I make her dinner all the time.
* Scratches my scalp while we're just sitting there.

I dunno, when she does something mundane she acts like it's the most special thing in the world and acts all high and mighty about it. It's adorable. ""*I* just made *you* dinner. Aren't I the best?"" She holds her head up high and I honestly don't think she's joking. It's nice to see her so happy to make me happy."

"I was seeing a guy who would pretty much exclusively text me via snap for the first two months I knew him even though he had my number and he would save literally every snap. One day I was like why tf do you save every snap and he said so he could see what he said and then we kinda fought about it and after that I told him he can text me if he wants to talk and we haven't used Snapchat since. 100% single guy with nothing to hide (we weren't together and definitely not exclusive). Didn't even sext ever, just normal ""hey wanna hang out"" texts.   

I'm just as confused as you are. "
"This is adorable. I‚Äôm so happy for you and jealous. 

Stuff I like:

Finger running through my hair, especially the back of my head and top of my neck. 
Touch my chest for the love of all that is holy. Softly raking fingernails on my back and a little butt grabbing go a long way. 
Also, it‚Äôs fun when you guide my hands where you want to be touched. 

When things are defiantly going downtown, I always prefer being teased a bit before, well, we get on the non-stop D train. Inner thighs, waist, also lots more body kissing. 

Also, ear nibbling and neck kissing. 

Tbh, if we‚Äôre making out and my hands are all over you, I‚Äôm already turned on. So just have fun and just let your own hands go where the want. As long as you don‚Äôt poke me in the eye, anywhere you touch will be an ‚Äòerogenous‚Äô zone

"How tired/exhausted I would be

How I can no longer sleep as soon as my head hits the pillow yet somehow magically wake up just after sunrise (no matter how tired I am or how much sleep debt I've accrued). 

Coming to the realisation that my choices are now mine and I have no safety net. I have the ultimate freedom and no guidance. 

Understanding that my relationship with my family will never get better no matter how successful I am. 

Understanding that the fantasies I had of being an adult, as a kid, isn't what it's really like. Also understanding that all the things I really wanted to do as a kid (travel, for example) is just not appealing to me anymore. 

Everyone around me fearing aging. ""if I get any older, I won't be able to find a partner, settle down..."" 

Other than that, being an adult pretty much rules. I have my own freedom and can do whatever I want. I can define myself. If something is shitty, I can find a way to leave the situation. Maybe I'm just the lucky few that really loves my adulthood and would never be a child again - not unless people I love were going to be tortured and killed if I didn't. "

"I think the idea of leaving your number when you pay the bill is the best most non confrontational way forward. I she decides not to text, just act like it didn't happen next time you are there. 

But this 'leave women alone' when they are working, at the gym, out with friends, alone, listening to music, walking down the street, at the club, at a bar, on the train... is ridiculous. If most men followed it, they would never date at all. If women were picking up the slack and doing a reasonable proportion of the asking and getting rejected too, guy's asking less would be an option. As it stands for most men, if you see someone that interests you, now is probably your only chance to take a risk and see if she will reciprocate. You don't have the luxury of waiting for a more opportune time. 

Without picking up any of the slack, women are asking if men will ask them out, do so at the right time, in the right place, in the right way and if they get it wrong they should be creep shamed.  

As long as you are respectful and considerate of her circumstances, I don't see anything wrong with starting small talk and gauging her response before trying to get a number or a date. I've met brilliant friends under all of those 'leave her alone' circumstances and taking offense at someone finding you interesting is immature. "

"nope, just really, *really* bad at picking up on hints"
"The two biggest ones are career success and sexual experience.

A man with an impressive job, like a medical doctor or a C-level executive or even just a reasonably skilled musician, is more attractive to women than he would normally be. It's not necessarily about the money he earns but that he is driven and successful. 

But this doesn't really work the other way around. A woman who works as a doctor isn't any more attractive than a nurse. Which makes sense: men aren't conducting job interviews on dates, so how impressive a woman's job is doesn't matter beyond establishing that she's not too unstable to hold down a job or get through school. 

The other one is similar. Women use preselection a lot, which is why you'll notice being more attractive to women when you're in a relationship. Generally if a guy is getting attention from a lot of women then he must be doing something right, so women will put in a disproportionate amount of effort fighting for the most desired men.

Men, generally speaking, don't see it that way. If other men are willing to have sex with a woman, then that means that she's probably alive but doesn't say much more beyond that. Besides, men have working eyes and we can see whether or not a woman is attractive for ourselves. A woman without much or any baggage in the form of previous partners and who we don't have to fight over is more appealing than the reverse."

"I've had women send me nudes, telling me she would totally fuck me and still the same ""you're just a friend"" I drew the same conclusion if they don't initiate I just assume its nothing and just banter"
As a server and a female I think this is the best approach.  Don‚Äôt put her on the spot and will make it easier for both of you 
"&gt; it‚Äôs ok because she already came üòÇ (I‚Äôm laughing but I‚Äôm sad) 

 üòÇ  üòÇ  üòÇ  üòÇ  üòÇ  üòÇ  üòÇ  üòÇ "
"The woman who would become my wife offered to pay for coffee.

Sounds like a small thing, but she was making a third of what I was making, and was in debt. Women never pay for anything, certainly not in such a situation. The act was powerful.

It's been many years since that day, but she's got my heart forever because she's so giving and willing to help others."
*how*
OP is just being a poor sport.
"Dude, wtf

You just don't do that man, even if she bets you"
You just missed a bullet of crazy. Be grateful.
"Hug me, caress as much of me as possible, pull me close, put her hands on my hips and ‚Äúmove‚Äù them with/for me, wrap her legs around me, draw me into a lot kiss, vocalize, anything that expresses pleasure and love really."
I bring her the whole bag because that sack is a black hole of junk.

Recent realization for me. Still getting over the disappointment...
I‚Äôm a girl and this also sometimes bothers me. I have all this cute underwear and my boyfriend prefers the most plain ones I own and I‚Äôm like ............. I try so hard for you dawg
"And basically no matter what word you use (curvy, thick, whatever) it means fat 90% of the time.

I'll basically ignore any woman who uses those words, even if she doesn't look overweight, because images are easy to fake."
I try to do this then I‚Äôm disappointed by the 4th week and just shave it off. Lol 
You know how hot it is when ya girl is giving you head and she's looking into your eyes? That's how she feels during sex when you're looking into hers.
"Some good ways. Some bad. My favorite is one time she was talking about a piece of tupperware and said ""It's a few sizes too big"" and without thinking I just snapped back ""YOU'RE a few sizes too big."" Fun was had by all.

On the flip side, the first time I made her cry was by telling her I thought she was beautiful. So that had to earn me some points, right?"
"It was a bit of a sad story but basically we live in different states so he had to go back. I was (and am still) really in love with him and would have dropped my life here and moved to his state. Before anything happened though, a jealous guy from my past (he wasn't even my ex, just someone who liked me and was a bit crazy) found out I was dating him, called and had a nice ""chat"" with him. I honestly don't know what he said to him and what percentage were lies, but it was enough for him to leave me."
"I also picked up silently walking when I was younger and I‚Äôm a heavy weight / hairy dude so when people don‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm behind them I get the jump scares, I enjoy it some times tbh. "
"Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles would start a gofundme to get my eyesight restored.

That blind."
The trick is to get a couple shitty kids and an awful wife. Then leaving them every morning is the highlight of your day. 
"Saying this as a guy, a lot of guys *think* they want a totally natural face, but really they just want natural looking makeup. I remember a thread where a girl showed heavy makeup, natural makeup, and no makeup, and every guy was like ""yup, the middle is what I prefer; I was wrong."" "
"Because all he would do is hit it and quit it. Thats all he's been doing for the past 5 years. He's slept with more people in the past year than the entire decade before that. 

He said he never had a slutty period in his life. He always struggled with self esteem issues and about 6 years ago he started working out and got in really good shape. I respect the fact that he is straight forward with women though. He lets them know that he isnt looking for anything serious. He's almost 30 now though, but doesnt seem to be slowing down any time soon. "
Flirting sure has changed a lot since I last dated.
"I had that happen. Her BFF (acquaintance who was having party) texts me and tells me she's been talking about me all night and I should get my ass to the party. Her other friend (my fiend) tells me girl is totally into me and wants to ""get to know me better, wink wink."" Girl is chatting me up all night, rubbing against me etc.

Party ends and girl asks me if I would like to keep the party rolling and head back to her place, she lives close.

Get to her place, she changes into basically lingerie, I make a move and she tells me just because of the way she dresses doesn't mean she wants to sleep with me and I should leave because she just wanted someone to watch netflix with.

So I feel ya man. I feel ya"
"Bread, butter (way too much), salt. About 6 rounds with the middle ones buttered both sides.

Microwave until greasy. Eat as one sandwich.

"&gt; A better alternative is 

Literally fucking anything else."
"To be fair, she just has poor theory of mind.

When she's looking for a man, I'm sure that having a PhD would make him a catch. But that man isn't using the same criteria when he's done looking at her."
"Step one: Go get in your car
Step Two: Go to the skin store
Step Three: Buy some thicker skin
Step Four:  Have them bring in thre crotch a bit. You won't need the extra room for those tiny testicles. 
Step Five: Go back to work
Step Six: Get Over It"
"Being compared to past boyfriends. My wife thought it was a good idea to tell me what her past boyfriends did for her to get me to start doing more things she likes. I ripped into her one day saying there's a reason you're no longer with them. If you want someone like them, then be with them. That's not who I am.

Here's another. No matter how much Cosmo, your best girlfriend or your best gay friend tells you, not all men enjoy having their prostate stimulated. Just like your clit, direct pressure can either be pleasurable or down right painful. While some men get off on anal stimulation, not all men do."
"Everything.

I hated being young.  My entire childhood comprised of being micromanaged by my parents and given choices rather than choosing my own things.  I lived in the middle of nowhere and far from my friends.  I had no money to go out and do things.

It was only after becoming a self sufficient adult could I do things I wanted to do.  Cook my own meals, see the world, make mistakes because fuck it, why not? I love that feeling of freedom and knowing that I made that choice rather than somebody else picking things for me."
"Completely agree.... My ex have nothing better to do, her hobby is literally me.... She end up being too clingy and hinder me from any social interaction"
He's a good looking lad. Remember that time he licked out a skinny woman in a cave? Fair play to him.
Kids eat ass these days.
When she meows back at you. Something so primal about it that's really reassuring. 
"This. We fired a guy at my last company because ""showers are against my religion."" 

Management said, ""We'll risk the court battle.""

He sued on religious grounds.

Judge threw it out.

Take a fucking shower."
"My friends? Pfftttt. You‚Äôre better off asking Amy Schumer to tell you a funny original joke. 

Out of my social circle, besides one guy with his first girlfriend, I‚Äôm the only one that‚Äôs dated multiple girls and that‚Äôs reaching. I‚Äôve not dated a girl properly in 4 years, unless you count fucking for 3 weeks in a row then never speaking to each other again. "
How expensive life is especially kids. Second I saw the hospital bill after my son was born I about had a stroke. I wish somebody told me when I was kid how much adulthood sucks because then I would‚Äôve enjoyed it more instead of trying to grow up faster. When you‚Äôre a kid you think once you move out your life is gonna be full of parties and doing whatever you want. Reality is you‚Äôre usually so broke and overworked that you just come home and sleep. 
"This. I‚Äôve also written my number on their bill and say text me later, I get off work at x."
She was drunk bro. 
*manipulation
"I don‚Äôt get how people can do this. I love when someone holds the door and always thank them. I mean, you‚Äôre walking six inches by them...pretty weird to just ignore a person. Oh well. "
"What do you mean, ""classic reddit""? Do you even love us? I think we should break up."
"I worked in the bar scene for half my twenties. I don't think I've ever seen a regular succeed unless he was so regular he kind of entered into the bar itselfs  clique (and these were usually other bartenders). Im really not trying to be a dick here but it's like, a shitty spot for them  to end up in. If you're the kind of guy who is asking reddit how to do it. I don't think you're going to pull it off man. Remember they're *working*. 

Ive found alot of bartenders/waitresses will just be super aggressive/forward when they're legitimately interested. basically they do the picking up. "
"Having fancy shoes and having a large shoe collection. I can't speak for other guys, but I never cared about how flashy a woman's heels look or if she has enough to match every outfit. As long as she looks neat, it's all good.

Also I have no idea why some women think it's cute to have Snapchat filters on their online dating profiles. I'm trying to see your presentable yet natural look, not you looking like an animal!"
lmao I had no clue how much this response would improve my Monday 
"I always say ‚Äúif YOU think you‚Äôre fat then you should probably work out or run, but I think you look great just the way you are‚Äù "
"Mhm mhm, I hear what you're saying. So just kinda dive headfirst? "
Only when she stopped taking hormone based birth control.
"I eat whatever I like least, first. That way I can finish on a high note."
Cause they lost every last shit they ever gave.
"Balding at 21 really hurts.

Having girls you get with tell you that you still look ""cute"" but you'd look ""way cuter"" if you had hair just really hurts more..."
"Told a girl she fine as a 9.9 in high school, asked why not a 10 and cried, and i was known as mean.  In all fairness she was really just a 7 -7.5 "
The family must come to the table for dinner and no TV/radio playing in the background. Living with my GF who likes to eat watching TV is an adjustment at dinner time.
"""Thanks for the sex, here's a loaf of bread"""
Go for the penis.
"1 otter: Slightly weird but fun guy, life of the party but more conservative people may be turned off

2 otters: Uhh... Not sure if this is normal my dude

3+ otters: Crazy otter guy"
"You should try shovel beans. 

It's where you roast baked beans on an old shovel over an open campfire. It's a delicacy"
I think I had more disposable income when I was 16 haha 
"Texarkana, Texas. No good jobs, no local culture (by that I mean everything was a Chili's or Olive Garden), nothing to do, very conservative environment led by a couple of Southern Baptist churches, dry county (it's now wet), it was always hot, misquitos because it was built on a swamp, white people said the N word like it was noting. everything was just depressing. "
"OP is having issues with the first round, this just gets the first round out of the way"
"telling my mom I was moving  because I wasn't happy living with her. I'm still not happy now, but at least now I'm not sad and my head is clear more of the time."
"Absolutely.  Wanted to add a great piece of advice I got from my PI:

&gt;Definitely admit that you don't know if you don't, but try to respond along the lines of ""good question, I'll have to look into that and get back to you"" "
"Female here- I do most activities with my boyfriend because I like him and like spending time with him, and he's basically my best friend. But I also enjoy doing things with my other friends or alone. It's different when someone WANTS to spend all their time with you versus NEEDING to spend all the time with you. "
"I don't think you can, old sport"
"&gt;A woman who works as a doctor isn‚Äôt any more attractive than a nurse. ...

I‚Äôm going to have to disagree with you. I‚Äôm not attracted to the job itself in most cases, but the job is a sign of many other things that are attractive: intelligence, determination, discipline, the drive to work toward their goals, etc. ETA: the ability to comfortably support one‚Äôs self, and financial experience. This is huge.

I don‚Äôt love your example because being a nurse is already a decent enough job to interest me, but I would still be more attracted to a doctor than a nurse based on what I explained."
Same reason I used to always play Jaws on Goldeneye. Sometimes you're so good you need a handicap to have fun. 
"I was about 11 or so and this girl with a metal ring would hit me in the head on the bus.  She did it and i was like ""The hell are you doing?  Stop that shit""  So she did it again, and again, and again, until I finally got up and screamed at her ""Hit me one more time bitch and I'm going to punch the fuck out of you"".  I sit down and it's not 2 seconds she hits me again, so I pop up spin around and WHAM!  Right on the top of her head.  I swung HARD too.

I cocked my arm again and my friend, sitting next to me, grabbed it and was like ""She got the point"" but i look and she's grabbed her head and just starts balling her eyes out.  She never really talked to me much after that.  It wasn't until later that I realized she may have had a crush on Me as she would do a lot of stuff to get my attention and after the punch, she didn't have much to do with me."
"Working retail for years I can say the amount of people who misconstrue ""customer service"" for genuine interest is shockingly high. I do feel for the lonely souls and it's not always unpleasant chatting but I've had men 40+ years older ask me if I wanted to get dinner. No, I want to get back to my JOB, and then go home and smoke a bowl and forget this conversation entirely."
"I'm no expert on sociopathy or Antisocial Personality Disorder, but I think it mostly has to do with a lower amount of empathy and conscience.

Also not an expert on children, but I'm pretty sure they *also* have a much lower amount of empathy and conscience.

So I'm like 90% that all babies are sociopaths."
"Hand out monetary incentives to make yourself infertile. Considerint the type of crazy shit people do for drugs and what not, getting stiched for one grand is something I bet a lot of people would go for.

After a generation, a lot of undesirables are weeded out and labor becomes more valuable as the workforce takes a major blow.

EDIT:Yes I know it's fucked up."
"Damn I miss her too and I‚Äôve never met her, come back to us!!!"
My rule was the opposite. ‚ÄúKeep your hands out of your pockets so they don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre trying to steal. ‚Äú
"I am that friend.

I've asked a few people to set me up, but my social circle is small and most of my friend's friends already have partners, don't want a relationship etc.

As for why I'm single, ain't got a clue as I generally have my sh*t together and am not an orge in terms of appearance. I always get positive remarks from friends too, and I know they'd be honest with me."
"To be fair, it allows her to control exactly who she allows to talk to her. She's just having her cake and eating it too."
I enjoy how much you enjoy that I do the same with milk 
"My girlfriend is always bothered by the fact that I don't care about her underwear. She will buy new pairs and ask me what I think, and I will just say ""Cute."" and then go back to whatever I was doing. Underwear is just underwear, and there's not a lot of room for it to be very attractive or creative."
"I'm not single a lot, but I agree with your comment. There are people who have very specific ideas of who they are looking for. I for one am aware of exactly 0 women I'd be interested in, who'd be in my close environment or whom my friends might know. I had to go beyond that, on my own, to find somebody who I enjoy dating. 

If somebody tried to set me up with these women, based on the assumption that I'd like them, since they have vaginas, I'd be actually pretty annoyed."
It cracks me up when I see ‚Äúmessage me first‚Äù in the bio... I CAN‚ÄôT! 
"Once my little brother and I had to split a ""Big Hunk"" candy bar. I, as the clever older brother, asked if he wanted a ""Big"" piece or a ""Hunk"" Piece. He of course said ""Big"" so I cut it between the words and took the ""Hunk"" piece for myself."
"Remember that men rarely get compliments, even from women they are in relationships with. We almost never compliment each other, and never get unprovoked compliments from women we don't know.

It allows men to easily have festering insecurities due to continued uncertainty.

""I really like that hat on you."" 

That can be huge. Don't lie obviously, but just let him know when you think he looks good or did something nice."
Lost me at garlic only being good for 3-4 days.  That shit stays on my counter for weeks and still tastes good.
The stuff romcoms are made of
"&gt;Many men actually hate it, and it's likely for the same exact reasons that many (most?) women hate it. Rejection sucks.

Not just that, but we're constantly told that we're creeps if we do anything."
"On the other hand please be rougher/firmer with the shaft, it's not like the balls, it can take more punishment and a tighter grip. "
"According to my then 5 year old niece, it was because ‚ÄúYou never listen to what I have to say!!‚Äù"
"European here. Usually non-exclusivity has to be talked about. Where I live and at my age exclusivity is assumed.

Not many people take kindly here to the 'date x people to pick one after weeks of sorting', although by now there are people who do that.  Tbh I'm not a fan and I'd drop them if I found out they went to a romantic date with someone else in between two romantic dates with me.

Also, the  dating period isn't a thing here. You either are in a relationship or you aren't. Americans on reddit seem to treat commitment and exclusivity like a huge scary step, but it simply isn't.

Edit: realised I am on r/AskMen, have the wrong gender. Oops, sorry. "
"I agree. As long as you are polite and not creepy, I don't see what the problem is. Just say I'd love to take you to dinner some time, no pressure, this is my number (when you're done with your meal). Don't ask her if she's seeing someone, just ask her out."
"""... So you're saying I'm fat?!"""
Once or twice 
Yup. This was my ex. She was young and didn‚Äôt really care much about my success and couldn‚Äôt handle when I was going through shit so we got into fights. It was partly my own fault too though. 
"""We teach people how to treat us."" As in, no matter what you SAY, if you allow a certain behavior from someone else to get them what they want, they'll keep doing it. Heard that phrase in my mid 20s and it's totally changed my life."
"Just because they're experts in your field, doesn't mean they know diddly squat about your project. *You* are the expert on your project. "

"I think they made a type and meant to say ""if you AREN'T showing interest"""
"If you aren't a healthy baby (as in life long illness determined in-utero), no birth for you. Obviously it won't ever happen, and it goes against equality and all that, but I think it would make a big improvement in our society."
The cell phone I use to shitpost on Reddit all day.
i sent a meme to a group chat and got silence ^^fucking ^^normies
"Also, a loaf of bread lasts a lot longer if you're the only one eating it. But also expires quite quickly. "
My sexy dad bod. Gets way more chicks than my in shape high school body. 
This is awesome
No shoes on in the house. Which I guess isn't really that strange. My parents were just clean freaks
"Damn, sleeping until 10:00 *is* sleeping in. I'm up between 5:00 and 6:00 on weekdays so when I sleep until 8:00 on Saturday I'm definitely sleeping in."

"Am a girl, hi! This is perfect. Do this. All of it. This made me clench my thighs. And the grabbing wrist thing... so much yes! Especially if the man has big hands and can grab both wrists with one hand while the other is doing its thing. If you're not comfortable saying these things, then i reccomend heavy breathing or a throat groan/moan? thing that guys can do. "
well maybe she needed to learn that physical violence isnt the way to get someone's attention. Its the path to getting hit back lol.
"""Oh sorry, didnt knew you wanted those last 4 slices of pizza as breakfast. I threw them away when we went to bed.""

Some people are stupid
"""Thicc"" is another term I have heard lately."

That's not acting.

They hate my cargo shorts but love the weed I keep in in them...
"Ding! Those arguments are impossible to win, so I just say things like ‚Äúwell, if you think you‚Äôre fat then do something about it. I think you look fine though.‚Äù "
Why on Earth did she have bumble when the point was for her to message first? 
"This actually has happened to me, and it ended quite tragic. I befriended a guy I knew was gay, even though he was still in the closet to everyone. I would constantly tell him about the girls I was crushing on, and he would build up my confidence, not by hitting on me, but just complimenting my attributes.

He came out to his family and it was quite ugly. His dad was quite accepting, but his mother was really not okay with it, which hurt him the most. Not too long after he came out, he started doing drag shows, which came as a real shock to me. He would go to clubs and perform these kind of drag burlesque/cabaret show things (I do not know what the hell to call them.)

Anyway, I play the guitar, and he knew I wanted to get into performing, so he asked me to play accompany guitar on stage while he sang. I reluctantly agreed, but it was surprisingly fun. I would be dressed in my normal attire, and he would be completely dressed up in his drag costumes. Guys who do drag are some of the coolest people you will meet if you make your intentions around them clear so both parties know how to behave. We would do songs like ""Angie"", or ""Landslide"", and he would dress as Stevie Nicks in all black garb, and this big blonde haired wig. He was so incredibly talented at this. My playing got recognized and I started accompanying other performers with my guitar playing.

The last night I saw him, he seemed distraught before a performance, and he told me that he had been in love with me since the moment we met. I told him he knew that I did not feel the same way outside of platonic feelings. I did feel flattered, because so many of the other guys he performed with really loved him, and he could have had any one of them, but he thought I was the one for him. But at the same time, it hurt that this was out in the open, because what do you do? I could never reciprocate these feelings equally. We did not argue, and he did not cry. he seemed to know what was coming when he told me. 

We did our performance, and later that night after we parted company, he killed himself by lying down in front of a freight train in this desolate area of our county. He left a note in his car telling why he did it, and the way it was worded more or less but the blame on me, though not solely. He had other issues he was going through that I did not know about. I withdrew from the community I had frequented with him, and quit playing the guitar altogether for almost 3 years. 

I always wonder if there was something I could have done different, but the options were/are obviously limited. there were of course the other issues he was dealing with. I hope he found the peace in death that he believed he could not find in life. "
Dude.  That is sad.
"I can control the volume of my voice though, I can't hold back tears. Can't call them at will either. Saying crying is manipulative implies intentional, which for some people I'm sure it is, but for me tears start pouring when emotions get high so if someone near and dear to my heart is yelling at me hell yeah there's gomma be tears - either because I'm upset or generally pissed."
