"&gt; Minesweeper and Solitaire were added to windows back in the 3.1 days, to train mouse discipline without the users even realizing they were learning. Solitaire was added to teach users how to Drag and Drop, Minesweeper taught using the right/left mouse buttons and mouse precision/control.  

Huh? TIL. I really didn't know that. It actually makes sense when you think about it, but my did it flew past me."

"Now, where did I put those Vista laptops? :)"
"What was the colour you ended up with? Have a brand new Phillips hue(and compatibles) system to set up, might as well set it to the colour of God while I'm at it."
"""Congratulations, son. It's not often someone is dumb enough to inspire a warning label"""
The first clue that it wasnt a USB port should have been that the cable inserted on the first try. USB superposition is real.
"For those confused: A VIP is not a very important person in this case, but a [virtual IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_IP_address).

"Put a label on that machine that explicitly says it's not a convertible.

Somehow I get the impression they'll do it again."
I now have to brief user on how to open/close their device when I issue them.
And i thought the 9 or so i have open was a lot
"After some debate, we settled on a nice mix of white and green. White to represent the light and good, whereas the green was more of a peaceful color, as opposed to red.

The coordinator was fine with that and thanked me. "
"Step one; Remove users admin rights.   
Step two; The old carpet, shovel and duct tape experience. "
"To be fair, their app is complete garbage in every sense of the word. I've had it twice now flat out not let me claim my ticket while sitting in the parking lot of the theater.

Moviepass is one of those things that I'm going to abuse the hell out of it while it lasts, because there's no way it's going to last at this point. I give it 2 years max."
"Freecell was created to test 32bit programs (or 16 bit, I forget which and I'm too lazy to google).  MS Hearts was created to introduce the world to the Microsoft Network.  

Sneaky little bastards, aren't they?"
the level of stupid of some people... i'm amazed they even figure out how to call. 
"Put them in the sweat box! 
Wonderful, got a good laugh to start my day."
"Oh, but the sweet vindication came because the advanced tech agent did actually add it at Full Price. "
"""Technology is too complicated and the fault of the closest person to me at this moment who understands technology better than me""

My mom has kept the same car since she bought it new in 1995. So it's 22 years old and occasionally has small issues, like maybe an alternator goes out. I'm her go-to mechanic because I can be and because she doesn't have any money. It's funny how when there's an issue with her car, suddenly it's ""this car is such a piece of shit and I can't deal with this"" even though the car is in immaculate condition and rarely ever has any issues. I give her my expertise, time, and even parts for free and somehow it's never good enough, she ""just needs it to work and can't afford for it not to be"".  I try to explain why something could be the cause of an issue and she doesn't want to take my word for it and wants to just take it to a shop so they can deal with it... not realizing the only reason her car got fixed is because she brought it to me at 10pm and I fixed it for free on the spot. Versus getting it towed to a shop, waiting 2 days, paying $400, waiting longer, etc. &lt;/rant&gt;"
"&gt;I watched as the last LED on the UPS for the file server slowly faded away. It was dark in the room where the servers were. It was also eerily quiet.


This line feels like some end of the world shit."

This is why you monitor servers and their resources and have alerts set up for extreme cases.
"One day we're going to have thought activated gadgets. I guess Keith will be left out then, too. ""Did you think of activating it?"" ""Don't work"""
Mildly interesting: in revelations the Christian Father-aspect deity is described as a shining being the colour of jasper and carnelian (red) encircled by a ring of emerald light.
Doctors are like the **worst people ever** to support.  
"User with about 60 tabs open and hundreds of documents on the desktop wants to know ""Why is my machine so slow?"" I tell her that all those tabs will slow things down, and that the desktop display process is probably working too hard as well.

Her response? ""No they don't. They're just fine. My computer is slow.""

So tempted to tell her ""No, it isn't."" Instead I talk to management and explain that the problem is how she's working. Management suggests she needs a larger hard drive. I explain that isn't the problem. More RAM? No, not the problem. So now they're ordering her a new computer.

She will bring it to its knees."
"You assumed that everyone would read all the way to the end.  The last sentence was crystal clear, but the specific direction needed to be in the first sentence - the one everyone reads before moving on.  Because $users.

If you had said ""we're removing $plugin from the server"" instead of ""we're removing it from the server"" then maybe, just maybe, $clueless would have gotten a clue.  But the last noun prior to ""it"" was ""$submodule."""
"Don't know about that : D same book also says the Son-aspect is pretty badass:

"Nice, happy, internal thoughts along the way."
"Pure BOFH, great way of forcing then to understand what is going on IT."
I have always thought that call centers needed an abuse bot that you could send insane users to when they get out of hand.
According to users they're *incapable* of making mistakes
Everybody knows that the third try is always the right one.
"Tell them: ""If it works for you, its fine. When it stops working, pull your head out of your ass and close some tabs."""

This is why those little clips you can use to screw something into the outlet are a straight up godsend for IT especially when it's in a customer facing environment. 
“Here’s your sign.  Wear it all the time.”
just like windows live games!
"I have a small chromebook, how tf can you rip the screen off the keyboard. wow. has user been tested for PEDs?"
"Eh, if I am researching a problem, it is not uncommon to have 20-30 tabs open. I don't need to bookmark them as once I solve that problem, the chances are low that I will need to look up that exact error code again for that one random program that a client is using."

"I agree the app is garbage, but it's easy enough to understand and use. And I will be abusing it as well, I've seen every movie I want to and some even multiple times when they come out. I can't see it lasting very long either but I'm going to get my money's worth while I can."
JUST BUY MORE HARD DRIVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Yup. I never understood the point of having more than a dozen or so open all the time, because in reality you can only read so much at one time anyhow. Bookmark the sites, open them when you need to."
You trust users to delete files??? Holy crap you are ballsy 
"""My MindLink isn't working you need to fix it.""

""A report has been generated and sent to Management. You are literally to stupid to work here.""

What a world that would be."
This is very possibly one of the main reasons why the US nuclear launch codes were '000000' at one time...
So that's where Christmas colours come from!
"As a developer, never underestimate the detrimental effects of shitty UI. Techy people can usually figure shit out but the way we look at it, if someone has to be technical to use something like this, then the UI has already failed it's job. We're supposed to be enhancing or providing a *better* experience, not giving someone something new they need to troubleshoot, regardless of their capability of doing so."
Life becomes much easier once you realize that the Well of Stupidity is bottomless.
"Just to be an ass, add it back on full rate. Then they call back ""it looks like you just talked to us, the previous rep added it back on but there's notes here that say you hungup before the pricing was told to you"""

"When a [derecho hit the east coast in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2012_North_American_derecho), my company lost power for five days.  [This is how we got power to the payroll server.](https://imgur.com/E7Dwn)  Later that fall the office building got patched in to one of the backup generators for our production facility.  The IT gods blessed me a few months later when lightning struck that very generator and fried our ancient phone system.  Not only did I get a sweet new IP system, it was covered by our insurance!"
But the difference here is you're not *keeping* them open **all the time**.
