"&gt; By the end of highschool I HATED white people.
"
My kids mother and I almost married. She has some form of undiagnosed autism borderline mental retardation. She hid it pretty well. My boys turned out normal. Thankfully she had a manic episode and walked out on me. I work ever take her back. Dodged a major bullet.
Confused as to why this has been downvoted.

Good question. For some reason they envy those who are less fortunate than us? 
"Bro, you're online, lol! "
"Oh, am not recommending people do this. I'm just saying, I find it weird that some people can do what I do and are fine, but I hear about people doing something like taking a recommended dosage of tylenol then a recommended dosage of Nyquil, and somehow ending up in the hospital because they took 2x the dosage when I have easily (on occasion, not regularly) taken 50x the dosage and been fine. (And yes, that's not a typo, with a really bad headache I've downed half a bottle)"
This probably happens. It's probably rare. And it certainly is nowhere near the level of racism in the GOP.

Thank you Maeby.  If you were my cousin I would take you out.
"How old are you? Lol.
Fuck up my life.. like financially. I would know what to study for by the time I get out of high school and not have a massive fucking loan for a useless degree. Go be edgy somewhere else"

The quote might be good but it could probably be paraphrased so that you don't have to credit the author like he was some authority on intellectual maturity. It's kind of like quoting Hitler on freedom.
You would be correct

These kinds of people I donâ€™t feel deserve the comfort of even a standard cell to me though. You get used to that and it becomes every day and our life at some point. What to do I have no idea. But they donâ€™t deserve the same type of loving conditions as people in there for things way less.

It can if ur allergic to something in the vaccine and since they won't tell u what's in the vaccine .. autism is an umbrella name for all kinds of different issues. It's more likely to happen in children if you've been vaccinated while preggo

"Nonsense. It can indeed be a symptom of panic attacks, especially also when there are psychotic symptoms too. Its been described commonly in the psychiatric literature. 

Someone who is delusional can believe and feel the world is going to end right now and then have a subsequent panic attack.

"Like /u/MortonLoothorKodos_3, that did the opposite for me.

I grew up in a safe suburb with few black people. The only black people were upper middle class and very civilized. I didn't really think much of all about black people. No love or hate, I just saw them as another person.

Fast forward to moving to a city as an adult. Most of the rude, loud, obnoxious and mentally ill people, the types of people that you wouldn't find in a suburb, are black. All of the perpetrators of heinous, violent crimes in the news are black and fit a certain profile. After living in the city for a year, the association of (inner city black = bad) just happened unconsciously and automatically."

"There are 4 or 5 complete and total bullshit complaints on Reddit, and the belief that baby boomers screwed up the housing market is one of them.  The average baby boomer went to school, got a job, bought a house, raised his family, and had a few beers along the way.  The price of real estate goes up and up, it always has, and it always will.  Quit whining and buy a house.  I absolutely, positively guarantee you that I could get any of you whiners into your own house within one month.  "

"I donâ€™t want to give in to a prudish society that still regards sexuality in general as a taboo.

Of course babbling on about it just because you can isn't mature either, but weâ€™re still so deep in sexual repression that in most situations, making things a bit awkward to start to get people to be more open about it is worth it.

There might be lost causes where it's better to just spare everyone the trouble but in my experience those are the exception rather than the rule in the younger generations."

"If you search for ""network"" you get four schools/programs:

Lorain County Community College: Electronic Engineering Technology Computer Maintenance &amp; Networking Major, AAS

Michigan Technological University: Computer Network and System Administration BS

Universidad del Este (PR): Networking Engineering Technology, AS

Wentworth Institute of Technology: Computer Networking, BS

Note that ""engineering technology"" is not an engineering degree, it's heavy on hands-on time for technicians that will be working in the field or underneath an engineer in a laboratory and light on math. The three semesters of calc and differential equations are typically reduced to two semesters of less rigorous calc, and the classes in general are easier.

I could not find any ""network engineering"" programs. 

Yes, ABET accredits other fields besides engineering, but for an engineering degree to be worth the vellum it is written on, your undergrad program needs to be in their registry. "
"&gt; clubs do a great job of stressing dancers out because of the above, so it helps to tip your dancers more. Clubs donâ€™t take tips, and the less a stripper is worrying about her income the nicer sheâ€™ll be to you :)

"So you agree with what the word *means*, you just don't like what you believe is implied by the word? I can see the logic in that. I see 'privilege' as meaning something special you've got that not everybody else has, so it's a good thing other people should have too. Still, I know a lot of folks see it the way you do.

The basic concept behind it also includes the aspect of providing agency to the disadvantaged. It's like the way that people say 'people of color' to put 'people' first before the adjective. Sure, it seems a bit silly, but the idea is to make a point and provide agency and recognize personhood before identity."
