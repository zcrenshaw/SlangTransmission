An updoot for your baby Groot
"So, does that mean that you are your own uncle?"
"Biting my tongue!

I have read so many conspiracies about our son’s death - that it wasn’t really whooping cough that killed him, or that we are Big Pharma shills, or that we murdered him. I try not to respond to that sort of thing as I don’t have time to argue back and forth with conspiracy theorists. But it is hard to bite my tongue when reading such ludicrous stuff.

Not to be a dick but its you're and thats a helluva run on sentence. 
english class wasn't interesting so he stopped going.  
What has been the hardest part about being so vocal regarding this topic?
I am sickened to think that people accuse you of murdering your own child to further some sort of agenda. I am so sorry that such shitty people exist.
What is the point/focus of this “school”?

I just want to say keep up the good work. People may not always respond to logic but you  are so brave for using your story for good. 
Same as a normal school but to learn what you want to learn instead of things youll never use while being stress free and enjoying yourself

"As always when these amas come up, the question is, have you had sex, and if so, how was it ? "
Boy I have so many questions
"I don’t have any siblings, step or otherwise, which I’m glad about.

My mom’s parents were a little wary about the entire thing, they thought she was rushing into things (and I agree), but overall they don’t say much about it. My dad was very upset at first and as I said in another comment I don’t think he talks to his dad at all anymore. He doesn’t talk much about it to me though.

My mom honestly does seem happy, which makes it hard for me to be upset at the situation. Neither she nor my grandpa are bad people, and if they’re happy, so be it. I just wish they would have considered how this would affect other people, namely me and my dad, before starting their relationship. "
By studying the blade
"It could be worse... Chin up, seriously.  
Sex and intimacy have lots of methods and means, there are toys and all types of different manners in which to pleasure a lady.  Learn how to be good with your hands, your mouth, toys.  Most women do not reach the big O from penetration anyhow, me being one of them, its never happened just off of 'size.'  Learn how to do other things well. 

Who you are as a person, your personality, goals, wants, strengths, those are the important relationship components, not dick size.

I know a really good looking dude, he was super popular in high school, he has a micro.  He is happily married with 3 beautiful kids these days and not a lot of people know about his micro situation.  

Be willing to laugh at yourself and don't take it too seriously, work on other skills in the bedroom, you will be fine!

I will also add that some guys on the larger side of things are terrible lovers because they never cared to learn how to please a woman.  They think their big D is all they need and that could not be farther from the truth!  Be willing to experiment and have fun!
"
"I’m on good terms with my dad. I love my dad, I just think he needs to get his shit together a bit, but he isn’t a bad guy at all, he’s always been good to me, and my mom for that matter. AFAIK he hasn’t talked to my grandpa since the wedding, and I don’t blame him "
I guess technically but I’ll never consider my dad anything other than my dad. 
Well im trying to pursue a career in computer programming so I have all the resources i need here so yes I do think I will be

"It took me a long time to get to the root of the issue. Subconsciously my brain had some messed up notions such as deserving.it (in fact it wasn't until 28 when it ccurred to me that no most people are not ""seduced"" by 6 year olds, and I wasn't equally culpable for what hapoened.) 

I'm really sorry that happened to gou. Ignorance and dissociation as a means to protect yourself can mess with your memories. "

"Did the realization of what had happened hit you immediately or later. I was sexually assaulted in middle school and repressed it and didn't remember until about 2-3 months ago, I'm 21 now. "
"To give you some encouragement,  I dated a guy who as he put it  “was hung like a mouse”.   I had an orgasm with him every time.  The reason?  He didn’t have to pull out far so his pubic bone was hitting my clit constantly which I get clit orgasms easier than penetration orgasms.  I didn’t leave him because sex was bad because it wasn’t,  I left him because I was commitment phobic and he was way to needy."

I really want to know what you intend to ask this person 
"We have similar recommendations here - anyone with close regular contact with newborns should ensure they are up to date with their vaccines. We’d ensured our friends &amp; family had theirs before the birth of our daughter who was born a few years before our son was. But I admit we didn’t keep him wrapped up at home, sometimes we went for walks in the evening and once or twice he came with me while I dropped off our older daughter at daycare. So I can’t say that he was only surrounded by vaccinated people.

When he was dying in hospital we learned that other countries were offering pregnancy vaccination. Because of that we chose to go public, and 2 days later our government announced they would begin to offer whooping cough vaccines for free to all pregnant women. "
what problems have you faced because of it
"I was 10 when the first time I join the swimming club. 10 was the min. age to get the membership at that time. I used to go with my father. He is a swimmer. Few timea due to work he wasn't able to come with me so he used to drop and pick me up to the club and I have already made 4-5 friends there so he wasn't worried at all. There was a time, I asked one of the coach to teach me how to float, he said it's easy, I'll show you and then he lifted me in a way that it looks like I was floating but he was giving me support by his hand. His one has was on my cheat and the other end was near my costume. After few seconds his second hand went little lower and he was trying to play with a 10 years old boy's penis. Initially I didn't realize that, I thought his hand was touching just because he was trying to give me support but after a min I realized that he was doing it intentionally. So, 2-3 min later I said I got the lesson, I had no idea what was going on. I never told this to anyone. This is the first time I am mentioning this to people. I'm 28 now. "
"I am HR. I work for a very small company that is growing rapidly. I run the entire office on my own as well as safety coordination. The only person I could report him to is one of the other shareholders.

Yes and no. On days 1 and 2 I was hungry. Rumbling belly etc. But it was day three that I couldn’t stop thinking about food at all and was so tied I went to bed 4 hours earlier than normal. I used will power to get through that day and decided to figure out whether to carry on or not the next morning. I felt much better the next day and carried on for a further 4 days and they were pretty easy without really being “hungry”. 
"I’m not sure where you live, so this may not be how it works there (I’m a nurse in the US) but you mentioned above that adult immunity from the whooping cough vaccine tends to wear off in adulthood... which is very true. The pediatricians I’ve worked with suggest that anyone in close contact to the baby (ie parents/aunts/uncles/grandparents) get a booster of the TDaP (for people unfamiliar this is the shot that has the tetanus and whooping cough component, it also has diphtheria but that is not as common in the US), is that encouraged where you live?

I’m so sorry you have to fight this, antivaxxers are ruthless... and like you said this is a harder illness to achieve “herd immunity” with, but if they would get their heads out of their asses it could help prevent tragedies like yours."
Are you doing OK? Like I hope you're alright
Yeah I have a parka on. And I already talked with staters. My rescue crew is en route
Ah ok. I hope your family chose a woman then  
"you may find a message board for women with [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginismus) (Vaginismus).  i could see it as being pretty awkward, but the ""sex with me would be easier and less painful than with anyone else"" card could get you some play.  and because the women would know that you are being out in the open about it, it could show that you are owning it and trying to find something that works."

No. One effed up thing about 2016 for us though was that our democratic candidate for governor won the election....and then changed parties and is now a republican.

"How is this different than a daycare? I don't mean that disrespectfully, I mean it honestly.

If you have no requirements to actually do anything, can leave when you want, can ""take"" whatever classes you want, you receive no certification at the end, and you have to pay for it, how is this different than just dropping your kid off at a school-aged version of daycare? "
you're a dope guy. anyone who has the same solution to every problem has something wrong with them. 
Many times. This is one of those times. except I know how I got here
I had work today.
"Best case: After months of “negotiations” (I use that term loosely because collective bargaining as public employees is illegal) and 7 days of striking, our best case scenario would be for our republican legislature to pass a 5% pay raise and fully fund our PEIA insurance. (Public employees insurance agency) 

Worst case: We continue the strike for an indefinite amount of time. OR We go back to work with no raise and our insurance rates continue rising with less and less coverage. We re-elect the republicans in November.

Most likely scenario: We take a 5% raise and freeze our PEIA coverage through next fiscal year and return to work sometime this week."

"Thanks for your kindness.

I learned pretty early on not to lose my temper. About a week after he died I read a comment on an article that accused me of not breastfeeding and that’s why he died (all untrue). I wrote a pretty snappy response and then next day a newspaper article appeared, titled “Grieving Mum slams anti-vaxer”. I was mortified - that’s not who I wanted to be.

I try to find the humour/bizarreness in their claims as well, it stops me from going completely crazy. Some of their claims are borderline complimentary “she’s too well-spoken, must be employed by big pharma!” 

I don’t value their opinions so that helps too!"

"One reason to NEED permissible access by qualified civilians to high levels of weaponry is as a de facto deterrent against tyrannical policy.

Not so that you WILL shoot back in a civil war, but so that the established powers sense that you COULD do so. This changes the trajectory of policy and prevents a gradual infringement of rights. If you think of lawmaking as a series of threads trending forward into the future, we can avoid certain tangled messes by providing pressures on the trends in their current instance.

Widespread access to firearms is a force that fights the trend of oppressive government - not just in explosive moments, but right here and now when nobody is pulling any triggers. It might delay an inevitable despotic government by a decade in the long run. 

You might prevent mass murders, which are an incredibly insignificant portion of causes of death in the US - but you might not. There is no alarmingly simple clear cut case for these kinds of policies once you’ve looked at ALL of the data together. It just doesn’t make trendlines obviously break without compensation on other trends of violence. 

Let’s say you did reduce deaths in the States by .001% per year.. in exchange for removing the only solid, unspoken barrier the common people have and accelerating the ascension of our government into tyranny? It WILL happen, on some level, somewhere. Eventually it will affect the quality of life of millions of people. In the 20th century, hundreds of millions just straight up died because of the oppressive conditions and violent acts of grossly overpowered and perverted governments. 

That’s just not worth it. We have to talk about other solutions. Solutions which will actually do something.

For the record, I fully support very strict gun control so long as level of access is never inhibited. It might be very difficult to get a suppressed rifle, but you’d better be able to get one if you’re determined."

"Hey thats dope!

For me it was the complete lie that was my life.
I walked in on my best friend from elementary school who I got hooked on drugs dead--his body was hunched over on the couch and he was yellow. I went to the funeral and broke down because his parents (who I grew up with) kept saying if they met the person who introduced him to it they'd murder him... and then in the same breath were saying how good of a friend I had been to him. 

Then I was robbing houses... allegedly... and another good friend got popped and sent to 5. A week later 2 other of my friends died. Then when I was picking up dope one day my drug dealer wouldn't let me bring my dog and when I came back my dog was gone. I remember laying under a bridge and looking up at God and thinking I am completely and utterly alone. 

It was like playing chess and I was a move or two away from being checkmated and I knew it.

Second, as someone who believes education is the only way to counteract the recent surge in anti-science beliefs, thank you for braving the crazies to give information to those who just don't know better. 

My question is, as you've mentioned you've been accused of being a big pharma shill, how do you not lose your temper/attack people whose knee jerk reaction to your tragedy is that it must be a conspiracy? "
"And it shows. This guy's grammar is pathetic. He was providing links to questions people asked him, then in later questions he couldn't answer them despite the information being in links he already provided.

Just keep open lines of communication with your child so they can come to you when needed, and who will answer your questions about anything.  

Hope this helps.

This fucked me up.
"Not at all - we have always ensured our other children are up to date on their vaccinations, and have had our recommended adult booster shots. I was raised by a scientist and have pretty strong beliefs about the importance of vaccination &amp; evidence-based medicine.

Unfortunately our baby contracted whooping cough at 4 weeks, 2 weeks before he would have received his first vaccination against it."
"One of the greatest feats in life is finding the one you love and when you do, falling deeply. It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity. It’s not perfect, it’s not romanticized, but it’s real. It’s defining. Shapes who you are and your understanding of your purpose and life. 

Make sure this is what you want. 

In my opinion, arranging a marriage for someone under 18 is not okay. You don’t know any better and it’s a decision you should be making when you are an adult. When I was your age I trusted my parents with everything. By now, I’m in my 20’s I’ve formed my own opinions and my own views far from what parents raised me as. 

Think about your life and make sure you know what you want. Think about it again. Now again. And again. You could be missing out on the one."

"I personally use semi-automatic rifles for hunting. For more dangerous game (i.e. wild boar) it's critical to be able to take follow-up shots. Boar are highly destructive and here in Texas overpopulation is an issue, so it's not just a gratuitous hobby.

They are also useful for self-defense. Here in Texas, a good guy armed with an AR-15 stopped the Sutherland Springs shooting just a few months ago (tragically, not before 26 people had already perished, but it could have been worse).

Finally, the original intent of the second amendment was to preserve an armed citizenry that could serve as a bulwark against a tyrannical government. I don't think the U.S. is anywhere close to a despotic state, such that this is an imminent concern, but given how dysfunctional our government has become, we're probably on the road to serfdom.
