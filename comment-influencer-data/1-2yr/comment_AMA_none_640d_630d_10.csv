"Sounds like a fantastic use of state resources getting a dead beat pot smoker like you off the street.

/s"
I was working A LOT of overtime and was pretty stressed. I just kind of forgot. Foolish I know. 
Reading this makes me anxious. Why didn‚Äôt you pay your speeding ticket? I could imagine that it didn‚Äôt seem like a big deal to not pay it. 
For anyone who doesn't understand pounds it's roughly about 133USD 
I don‚Äôt really have a question but this seems really harsh for not paying a speeding ticket.  I think we are long past some sort of criminal justice reform.  This shit needs to happen now.  Jails should be for people who are a danger not dudes who forgot to pay a ticket.  Agree?
"At the time, did you know that he was a shit-gobbling thundercunt?"

"That pain scale tho

"I‚Äôm super high as well right now. Trying to finish crocheting a scarf, but I can‚Äôt stop eating peanut butter cups. "
Got Damn Right! Merica!!
"This is going to sound harsh and I apologize in advance. You can keep him as a friend in your heart and still make him leave if he can‚Äôt pay rent. Also if he is bringing in illegal drugs into the home you don‚Äôt have to be around that. You have the right to take care of yourself and still be a friend. I work in a county jail and I see so many drug addicts use up their family and friends until they all are done with their crap. Drug addiction is a disease but it is not without personal responsibility. Your friend makes a choice everyday to use drugs instead of pay his rent, work, break the law or what have you. He makes a choice, always remember that. Being a friend does not mean you are a door mat who has to ‚Äúbe their for your friend no matter what.‚Äù A friend is someone who cares about you and who is their for you. That does not mean they don‚Äôt have to at least meet you halfway. You can have one last conversation if you want that he has to make a choice of drugs or getting help. If you want to you can make him staying there conditional on quitting drugs, treatment and at least pitching in for rent monthly. "
"You're only the second person I've encountered (either online or in the offline world) who has gone through the process that you described. The first one, when speaking about their experience, offered a very similar story: They latched onto a social movement, convinced themselves that it applied to them, and then became trapped by that self-deception. Also like you, they said that a sense of stubbornness kept them from doing any real introspective analysis, because the way that they'd come to define themselves had taken root as a piece of personal pride. One thing that they mentioned which you did not, though, was a kind of epiphanic moment wherein they realized that they'd gotten caught up in something that didn't actually reflect their true feelings about themselves.

That brings me to my question: What finally prompted you to reassess your perspective?"
"Most of my good friends and I are moms in our 40s who were tomboys when we were younger, and we've had the discussion before that if trans were the thing it is now, maybe we'd have identified with that. It makes me wonder. I was forced to wear dresses to church every Sunday and on all other special occasions as well which I hated. I also shopped in the men's and boy's sections at stores, mostly because in the 90s all the girls pants were high waisted and I wanted something more low slung.

I never felt girly. But as I got older and eventually became a mother, I have become very much a woman. I don't wear makeup and I do like to fix things and use power tools, but I embody my female side every day and I see all that poppy pink and glitter business as simply a preference that I don't have. 

Since I'm raising kids, I do wonder about helping them navigate all of this. You can't expect a kid to have the sense of self awareness that they might ultimately have when they're adults, so if my kid were to say that they were trans, part of more would want to try to temper that. On the other hand, being a woke and accepting person who sees clearly how difficult a path it is for trans folk in society I would want to support muy child if they saw themselves that way. I don't know how much weight a parent's pov has, or even should have, in a kid developing their sense of identity. Do you think that your parents could have said or done anything earlier to help you better see that you were on a temporary path that in the end wasn't right for you? "
"Thank you so much for the encouragement. 

I was 16 years old when I started to realize that I had been sexually abused. I was in denial about this aspect of things since last year or so. 

As a child, I had no words to describe what was happening to me. I knew what sex was, I just didn't have words for it or for rape. When I got older (10 years old?) and learnt what rape was, I remember staring at the dictionary definition for hours, reading it over and over again. I knew that it had happened but I was in denial and had no desire to look into it further than that. 

My parents don't know. At least... I told my father a few days ago, tbh. He was pretty calm about it. I don't think I used to terms ""human trafficking"". I said I had been tortured and used for sex. My mother doesn't know. My parents have been taking it pretty badly and it caused huge tensions. They do know that I've been sexually abused though. "
"Yeah but how many other dudes are just unlucky as well?   There is no reason people should spend anytime in jail for a ticket which carries no jail time. 

Also bail.  Fuck it.  It‚Äôs a scam. "
"Not a question, but a suggestion to keep yourself amused. Whenever I get dragged to this stuff, I substitute words that sound similar (e.g. meow for now, cow for how, swivel door for civil war, etc.). It's just the right amount of weird that people don't know if you're fucking with them or not

Key point, if anyone asks you to repeat what you said, use the correct word instead then go back to wrong word. It's amusing"
"I think I was just unlucky. Most people who get arrested are released the same day, but because the courts are closed for the weekend I had to wait and was processed into the general population."

"I went in for a routine surgery (as stated) and in the recovery room I started foaming blood. I was unconscious for the week after the surgery and have amnesia for the day before it so this is all what I‚Äôve been told from my family. 

I was out of state living with my BF and the doctors called my family and said they needed to get up here because I had a 50/50 chance. At first they thought it could be a heart attack but eventually I was diagnosed with Takasubos or Broken Heart disease. I was in a coma for seven days and on ECMO which oxygenated and circulated my blood. But the machine didn‚Äôt force the blood to both my feet and my right leg was ice cold and completely white. 

The surgeons prepared my family for what was going to happen (the amputation) but did not expect to have to amputate above the knee. When they began the surgery they realized my fascia was dead through 70% of my leg so they removed my knee. 

I woke up a day or two after the surgery but didn‚Äôt realize my leg had been amputated for a couple days because It was so swollen and I was super loopy from the drugs. I remember that the skin was black for a day or two on my leg. Looked like it was coated in charcoal. "
I'm sure they're all neck-deep in Non-disclosure Agreements
This question for future you. Answer it if you recall this question after healing. How is sex before and after circumcision? I heard that uncircumcised penises are more sensitive therefore more enjoyable.
"Yeah, my cellmate was in jail for public intoxication. Kind of sad how many people are in there for minor crimes."
"Not if you're salaried, like I am. I don't get paid overtime, it's just something you do to get the work done. I work 80+ hrs a week during tax season, and I get no extra money for it."
"I had to bend over and spread my cheeks, then squat and cough three time. Had to do it a second time one night because they did a surprise shake down. "
"I am female and live in a country where circumcision isn't widely performed, so maybe it isn't my place to comment, but I wanted to say something as I hate to think of you or anyone else being ""ashamed"" by their genitalia. 

Only exceptionally shallow people are going to care what your penis looks like. In my opinion no penis is ""pretty"" and really they all look roughly the same as far as it matters. It has never even occurred to me to judge the appearance of a sexual partner's genitalia and I am sure I am not alone in this. "

"My memories of this are very blurry. But it's not an uncommon occurence in these types of trafficking groups and most survivors I've talked to who went through this saw it happened to. They killed people who were ""dangerous"" - who might disclose what was going on or very small children who probably had been born in the group and did not exist legally.

I know that this is a very serious accusation to make... This is why I prefer to see it as ""this happened to me"" rather than ""someone did this"". 

It's incredibly hard to trust such memories. They're all I have to go on. I don't have proof other than my mental state (however, DID has been proven to happen because of repeated trauma in childhood). 

It's one of the most sensitive memories which is why it's very difficult to talk about. But I feel like  I have more to lose not talking about it and not believing myself because...I cannot stand those people dying in the ignorance of the world. I just can't.

Does that make sense?"

"How many minorities were in jail. The jail was like 90% black or hispanic. It shocked me.

It was also super boring. Those three days crawwwwwwled.

"I know it's AMA but I don't feel comfortable saying that. Sorry... The one thing I can say though, is that I live in Europe and in a very developed country - not at all a developing or poor country like most people think this happens in."
I‚Äôve lived with an addict before. It‚Äôs important as their friend not to enable them by paying their rent because that doesn‚Äôt help them and you end up sacrificing yourself. That‚Äôs not healthy. I advice creating boundaries to protect yourself. If you don‚Äôt want to kick them out perhaps you can reach out to their family and tell them it‚Äôs an emergency and you need their help to support your friend. I‚Äôd try that first. Good luck!
To think how much a video of some white kid saying the N word would be worth right now is almost the pinnacle of 2017
Keep in mind county jail and prison a very different places 
An excellent opening question
"This story is a perfect example of how broken social media can be. I saw ONE Twitter user claim that Keaton used the N word.... after that Twitter absolutely turned on this kid and claimed he was a racist based off of the tweet of one person. Reckless. 

"
"This response meant a lot to me. Thank you for putting it into that perspective, and you‚Äôre absolutely right. I‚Äôve done all I can do to help him, set him up with jobs, trying my best to get him off drugs, etc. I‚Äôm going to tell him I can‚Äôt handle it anymore. The reason I moved out in the first place was because of drug addiction in my family that was very hard on me so dealing with this once again is hard for me. Thank you again for putting it into a perspective that I couldn‚Äôt see because of the relationship I have with him."
"Great question, it is not legal to burn it down, a few years ago an american who was visiting came to this town and got tricked by his friend while drunk and burned down the goat, his friends said to him that it was legal so when the police arrived he stood by the burned skeleton of the goat and told them proudly ‚ÄùI burned the goat‚Äù, he was sent to court but fled off to America before he would go to jail"
"My babysitter ""kidnapped me"" the whole day I was supposed to stay with her. Some of the abuse happened inside the house, to train me for sex. The rest happened in another location. 

No, I wasn't a missing person. I was returned to my parents every night. What they did was put me to bed at the end of the day, gave me cough syrup or a drug to make me fall asleep and woke me up telling me I had had a very bad dream.

It went on because they artificially and naturally created my DID so that I would have amnesia for the abuse and would show little signs and wouldn't tell."

"Oh yeah I did.  They were hilarious sometimes and I miss some of them.   

My favorite joke hands down was when I found a meme of me on Reddit that a student had made.  I will PM it to you if you want but essentially it was me making this whacky face where my eyes are crossed and look giant.  I don't even know how they found that picture but bravo on that hunt.  Text: ""Icy hot as lube?  Oh no!  Baby wut is you doin'?""  It was easy to tell whose account it was so on the last day of the semester I had printed out the picture and paper clipped it to his handout.  At the top I wrote: ""Oh no! Billy!  Wut is you doin'?""

When he looked up at me in horror I couldn't keep a straight face and started cracking up.  It still makes me laugh to look at. "
Did they check your anus for anything when they stripsearched you?
"Wow, I have been saying that wrong my entire life thanks. I will not change how I say it but I learned something today. Reddit is such a special place lol"
"I really don't know. To be very honest, I have very little faith in the (legal) justice system. It is more a vehicle of power than of true justice, if you see what I mean? 

Still, I think that there should be some order to things. We live in a society... If we allow vigilante justice for one case, no matter how horrible, who's to decide that they can't go on punishing people for lesser crimes or because they don't like them? Who will regulate this?

Also, who would take on this responsibility? To kill? It is such a heavy burden to carry on your shoulders.

On the other hand, it would save a lot of people. And that's invaluable.

I see both sides and I really don't know. It's an interesting question and I'm very divided."

Jail seems a bit retarded. Even for U.S. standards "
"It definitely sucks. But I wasn't really prepared for how boring it was. It was mind numbing. Also really, really loud. All the time.

"Bit of backstory. Growing up, my dad was racist, and I think that pretty much instilled it into my genes, if you will. So growing up, I literally was racist. Not because I wanted to just because that's what I was used to.

Also, partly due to my OCD, I have severe OCD, which greatly contributed to my racism. But I want to come here to say, I've overcome it.

My racism wasn't I hate blacks. It was more a year of it, greatly overwhelmed due to my OCD. But because of therapy, and basically trying to ignore it, I have overcome it."

"I wouldn‚Äôt say that the media does this, the media is usually either dismissive or downright hostile. However, the concerns in your comment do apply to the online trans community. Certain communities online serve as echo chambers, and if one gets involved in one that contains constant positive reinforcement for trans people, this definitely can and does happen. Teens certainly do strive for acceptance and validation from a community, and they can find that sort of support and immediate gratification through echo chambers. 

drawing on my experience, when I had a fandom blog on tumblr, and also thought so was gay at the time. The trans activist context got sprinkled in, and over time I started to become immersed in it. Since trans people do very much need support and validation from others (because it sucks), it was easy for me to unconsciously adopt those traits in order to feel a part of something and have a stronger personal identity that was constantly being validated by others. 

The last question is difficult, because there really is no sure way to tell if someone is actually trans, or if they are doing something similar to what‚Äôs outlined above. Therefore if you simply not support them because of the possibility, it could end up seriously harming them. However, the only reason that I snapped out of it was because my parents basically broke through the wall I had built. If it wasn‚Äôt for them I probably wouldn‚Äôt have realized for much longer. It was the fact that hey didn‚Äôt support me 100% that allowed that. So there really is no good answer. 

For my parents, they always knew it wasn‚Äôt true, but they are also not prejudiced against trans people as a group. They acknowledge that the group does exist, they simply knew i was not a part of it. They always encouraged me to think it through, and wanted me to slow down, not stop. This is not the case with many families, as many would just reject the idea because they don‚Äôt like the concept and are prejudice. 

The simplest answer is to not react negatively, but encourage the person to explore as much as possible, examine the root causes and evaluate if there are any other options to alleviate the discomfort. Transition is not the only way, there are other options, which much of the trans community ignores.

Not even high and that still sounds epic. 
It‚Äôs been done before. If you look it up you can find it
"1. It depends who switches, but most of the times, yes I remember. I remember that someone was here and what they did but not in detail. When it first emerged I had no idea what my parts did in my absence.

2. No, absolutely not. We're against violence and most systems swear off violence because of their past abuse. This is a myth... The media love portraying us as violent... It's a disservice... But thank you for asking. I don't believe having DID makes you more prone to violence. If you have a problem with it, it's who you are's fault. At least in extreme cases like murder.

3. I don't know. It's complicated. It depends who you ask inside. I would say that we consider ourselves ""something"" that they are not words to explain to people who are single minded. The short question, though, is yes, we consider ourselves people. 

This is actually really important. Obviously there are not several people living in the body. But we've been abused so much that it's incredibly damaging to be treated as anything less than a person. ""Oh, you're just a part"" is not acceptable. We have feelings like you and we were traumatized. I would have trouble interacting with someone who would do that and it would trigger my PTSD badly. We're not less than a normal person. Some people feel as though the host, the part who's the most present is the ""real"" one and everyone else is treated as if they have no autonomy. This is wrong... Break a vase and tell me which piece is the real one or the original one. None! All the pieces are equally part of the vase.

I hope I didn't come off as rude. It was out of context but I feel very strongly about it.

4. Do you mean ""fall asleep"" as actually falling asleep? I'm not sure... It may have happened.

5. It goes both ways. If I feel scared or in danger, maybe a child part will come. But usually it's the opposite. The alter part affects my mood. Something I find amazing is the small imperceptible changes in the ""color"" of your overall state of being. I don't know how to explain better than this but it's an amazing and interesting feeling to experience.

Thank you."

Another that could help is if the faces, genders, ethnicities, class, etc. of people involved in a crime remain as unknown as possible to the judge and juror, and where they are only given the information they need to make a judgment, so that justice can perhaps truly be blind.
