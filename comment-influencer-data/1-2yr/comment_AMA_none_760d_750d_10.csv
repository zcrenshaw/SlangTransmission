Do y'all consider yourselves prostitutes at this point?
From any point of view. You get paid for sex. Lol
"Ah, I'm surprised nobody has told you whats wrong. When you give birth it means you're a girl. Girls obviously don't poop, so you're fine!"
One wanted a back massage for the whole session we talked about the countries we've been it was really nice. The other was my weird regular who likes to literally squeeze my butt and boobs for 20 minutes and then tips generously and leaves. I don't understand him at all but he's good money 
"1st question : Young students or 17 year old highschoolers?

Not trying to be creepy, but there's a massive difference.

2nd question : Were you in a relationship at the time the problem started to appear?

And just something i wanted to tell you, it's extremely brave that you decided to confront this and deal with it."
"Nice try, Kim Jong Un."
"1. 17 year old highschoolers. 

2. No, I had got out of a relationship with my 24 year old boyfriend the year before. 

Thank you, it was something I needed to sort out because I did not want to do anything stupid. 
"
Aren't they basically the same thing?
"Coffee (drink), stool softeners, laxatives, suppositories (nurse here)"
Escorts ;)
"your personal responsibility is admirable

i wish you continued peace and success"
Holy Fuck!!! You need to report her to the proper authorities. You might not be the only one she was messing with. Do you have any proof of the relationship?  Have you been tested for STD's ? 
"We met at a gathering for young students in Paris, it was a huge party just for students who were on a break. There were many students from all around the world and I even met some students from the UK, but I wanted to explore a little more and met new people. So, I went up to a group of French students and got along with the guys really well and then they introduced me to the women in their class. 

My wife was one of them and I stayed with them for the rest of the night and we had a lot of drinks together and we had the most random conversation and they all tried their best to speak English in the best way, my wife was the one who could speak clearly the most. 

My lead in pickup line was ""You're So Beautiful That You Made Me Forget My Pickup Line."" I did not want to do a real pickup line so this was the best I could do and I tried my best to say it in French before she laughed at me, but it worked! 

I kissed her first and she was the first to say ""I love you!"" 

Yes, she is French and she is pretty slow and sensual with her French kissing! 

Yes, she has a ticket de m√©tro. "
"I gave birth via c-section a week ago. Still hasn't happened. So on top of not being able to poop, I'm trying to do this while having four layers of stitches across my abdomen. I'll be here a while. "
"We have steep discounts for regular clients, or if you buy multiple sessions in one transaction (like buy 4 in advance). Getting checked for STDs gets a discount, if you just wanna watch the two of us or just want a bj we have a difference price, and we offer half hour as well to some folks. 

We almost always charge 800 the first time tho, it's like a vetting cost"
"wallet's empty, mom's spagetthi"
I ain't no pedo but schoolgirls all the way
"I never did.

It was abusive in the sense that I told her many times that I was uncomfortable with her advances and I stopped coming, but she would call my parents and convince them to make me come back. I was in a dark place and assumed that no one would believe me. As our sessions continued, she convinced me that I was in love with her. That's when it became physical."
"Generally 800 per hour, but it really depends on what you wanna do"
If you have those messages you should at least print them out and go to the medical board.  They should revoke her license and investigate her. 
I just patted my cat AMA
"Lost and drunk was basically my daily routine in Japan. I got an apartment for a month in Shinjuku. Went to work out at the local gym, by the same lunch, and afterward would pick a random train stop, go there, walk around, than walk most of the way back unless it was more than 2 hours walk. Stop at convenience stores along the way, buy sake and beer. Listen to hip hop. 

Have you tried any convenience store fried chicken yet?"
"Well, if your landlord keeps 100% of what you make, does that make him your pimp?"
"As a two time sexual abuse survivor and mom to a son who started high school today, I thank you for recognizing, owning and seeking help for this. "
So THAT'S what the issue is. I should have thought of that! 
"I do have like a ten thousand messages on Facebook.. And yes, I have been tested a month ago, luckily I' clean."
Had 10 clients slept with 8 of them üëçüëçüëç
Do you test pens for Pen Island?
I appreciate it. They told me not to use laxatives at the hospital but I think I need to at this point
"Well shit, I don't know

Is that a stereotype?

Are you serious?"
Life's not fair
OP is a shill for Big Vagina!
"Okay then, it's not abnormal, honestly.

Again, not creepy, just realistic.

Understood.Maybe if you were in a relationship these feelings wouldn't appear, because your partner would occupy all your sexual thoughts.

How do i do that!?....everything i say sounds creepy, but believe me, my intentions are good. :P 

"
This hasn't ever been an issue for me but a friend of mine has refunded a guy before because he was too big. 
I assume you were not an English teacher. 
"Playing music is up to the client; if he doesn't have a preference we generally just put on jazz or a pandora station.

We don't hide it that much, don't really care what people around us think. Most people aren't home in the day anyway, when we have a lot of our clients over. No shame, but might be embarrassed if family knew "
i can't fucking write in japanese
"Are you the only honest teacher?

Also, how many other teachers do you know that have become sexually active with students? I ask because I know at least one girl that lost her virginity to a teacher when she was 17."
The real crime in this AMA. 
"If you ran 8400 miles, did you fall down at approximately 8.4 doors?"
I worked in maternity. Stool softeners might work but if not suppositories usually do the trick. Take stool softener a daily. They just make it soft and not give you that urge to poop your pants. 
"Wow! This caught my eye! When i was a child i got fever hallucinations, with the feeling of the bed being huge and other things surrounding me got small etc. It stopped when i grew older, but on very rare ocations i get this feeling that my hands are very big and my fingerprints feels extremely big when i rub my fingers together. I get very very dizzy and nausea from it. And i usually hold them out in front of me and close my eyes, trying to think of something else. I dont know if that would be characterized as aiws. But wow! Interesting. :) "
"Literally a good chance of that. 


I'm guessing about 80 courics. "
Her medical license needs to be revoked. Report her asap. 
"* I am 21 now, this went on for five years.
* Since the beginning, she told me that she was married and had kids, but that she was just waiting that I got 18 to ask for a divorce. It was really strange as she had a way of being supportive and gentle, but in the same time threatening. I tried to end it several times but she would convince me that she was the only woman that could accept to be with someone like me.
* Anxiety and suicide attempt. She did help me at first, but the sexual abuse started relatively early.
* I always knew that it was wrong and would ask my parents to not make me go anymore, but they would not listen. They were pretty conservative and did not trust me due to my behaviour before I knew her."
"I love my job, I can honestly say it's the best job I've ever had. I think the hardest things are when men drop their messed up fetish on me in the middle of a booking. I don't do age play AT ALL but obv some older guys fetishise how young I look and I really hate that tbh "
cool just dont die 
"I seriously thought I would encounter way more foot fetish guys than I have. Anal is expensive so it's discussed waaaay more than it actually happens. 

We all intro the clients before they decide who they're going to book so we all get to explain what's in our services and give the guys a chance to ask questions. So I'll just say I'm not comfortable with whatever and I hope he finds a girl that is. I recommend girls for doubles all the time though and def recommend my doubles partner when clients are looking for another girl to book when I'm not there. 

Guys who are blacklisted have their photos taken from the camera feed and stuck on the back of the receptionist desk on the ""do not let in"" wall. We can see clients before they can see us so if someone's on your personal blacklist and not the brothels you can always just not intro and tell management that you're ""not working tonight"" for that booking. Plus we all talk in the girls room lol "
"Make it a Suntory time

Edit: typo"
I quit mainly because I did not have the self control anymore to refuse any advances from my students and I knew that I would give him and sleep with them. 
What do y'all charge?
"We do have a lot of clients, a lot of regulars and a good amount of new guys each week. We make good money haha"
No questions just wanna say congrats! :)
was his name Podrick?
"I think so, I don't if anyone else has been honest. 

My therapist told me once that they have had more teachers than you would think coming in to talk about this, but I personally don't know any other teachers who are sexually active with students. "
"12 hour shift, no judgement, just curious on how many you serviced today?"
Double paynetration?
"there's at least 10 black dude that asked me if I wanna come see the beautiful girls upstairs, I'm wondering if I could sleep there ifi don't find my way home, I'm fucked, or maybe i'll fuck well see"
Quite a few! I would say tonight is a pretty accurate representation of the ratio. Most dudes wanna do this even if they wanna have sex too. Like if they book for an hour we're not going be going at it the whole time (hopefully lol) there's usually a portion of each booking that's chatting and chilling. How much really depends on the dudes interest and how long he's staying for 
"Do the guys have to pay for the full hour or do you prorate some of the ""quick shooters""?

I can't imagine, at that rate, you'd have to do a lot of them per month unless you live in New York City or San Francisco. "
"I test pens to see if the ink material is any good.

On a serious note: a pentester is someone who tests the security of webapps or any security flaw that might cause harm to clients data."
With a lot of kindness mostly. I try very hard to direct conversations away from wives and what's going on at home. Asking about hobbies or movies is a good way to do that. Being chill about cuddling and generally trying to make it an escape from whatever is getting them down. 
gonna sleep in a fukin street ahahaga g a
"How do you hide it? Some people must be suspicious with random guys coming over and leaving again in an hour... What will you do if any of your relatives find out? Do you feel shameful about it?  Do you play music, if so what music lol?"
"At this rate, they would need to have 42 full price sessions per month to make ~200k each.  But many are not full price. That's just not sustainable. This business needs to grow. You need to bring in less experienced girls and take a share of each session. Since you'll have no legal means of managing their employment, you'll have to beat them if they get out of line. "
"I do find myself attracted to younger men and I'm not really attracted to men my own age. 

Well, I love youth and I love their energy and their excitement about the world, but also sexually, I just think they can last longer and give much better sex.  "
"You do know some things can't be cured and not all contraception is 100% effective. 
It only takes 1 person to touch their genitals and then touch yours and boom, you have herpes....for life."
"than*

I take it you weren't an English teacher."
"Hhey, wassup"
"UPDATE: 
I am crowning. It hasn't moved in about 15 minutes, but at least it is starting to break free. I didn't know my anus stretched this much. 

Current physical condition: sweating, shaking, and my right foot fell asleep. Pain is about. 3/10. Bracing myself for the worst. 

I haven't pushed yet...don't think I physically can. My mother in law is watching the baby. She thinks I'm taking a nap, so if I pass out from this no one will know. Crossing my fingers this moves along. 

I am wishing I had a damn squatty potty right now. I thought those were sooooooo stupid until about an hour ago. 

Thanks for the advice, everyone. My husband is bringing home a child's version of a suppository when he comes home from work. I could ask my in laws to get one and have it sooner, but I am not quite at that point yet. If that doesn't work, I will take the laxatives this evening. Praying we don't come to that. 

I am pretty sure this poo is wider around than it is long. Is that possible? Am I going to break the plumbing? 

EDIT: Nothing. It went back in. Taking a break. 

UPDATE 2- still very little progress. I created my own squatty potty thanks to an awesome suggestion, and I feel like this will help. Thank you to everyone who has given advice!

I'm really wishing I had used a throwaway. Concerned my husband or brothers will figure out who I am and be ashamed of me for redditing about my poo. Oh well. 

UPDATE 3- Husband came in clutch and brought me suppositories. Just handed him the baby, banned him from this side of the house, and took one. Pray for me. 

FINAL UPDATE- We made some progress!! I'm definitely still plugged up, but I got a little bit of a poo out. I ' felt things moving around though, so I feel a little better. Im going to take a laxative tomorrow to finish the job. Thank you to everyone for the advice!!! Y'all rock!!"
"IIRC most of the time they don't know what they're auditioning for.

Imagine if Star Wars episode VII was leaked before the filming even started because of an angry actor."
"Prostitutes don't generally get to pick and choose clients, and rarely keep the majority of the profits.  "
Let us know if the turd outweighs the baby 
"Secret and secret. Sorry, don't wanna take clients from this AMA"
"We think its a nice place! We have clients over, so we keep it looking nice.

Average age is anywhere from 30-45ish, most are pretty average looking.

We want to stop after no more than 2 years.

One of us is in grad school, one has a very part time job.

24 and 23"
"At this point it's mostly regulars, word of mouth, and we find guys on insta, Facebook (strangely enough), Snapchat, Reddit, tinder, bars, etc"
How do handle men who are lonely either from lack of intimacy at home or troubles at home?
God I just calculated how many sessions I would need to do to make what I make now... 3.25 in a month. 160 hours a month vs less than 4 hours a month. I think you're on to something!
"Wait, you play with people who haven't been tested? Isn't that sort of a big risk for you and your clients?"
"I'm sorry to hear about your abuse in the past and I hope your son does well in high school. I feel good that I recognised this and getting the help I need, my therapist has been great as well.   "

"Hello, [MCSWIGZ](/u/MCSWIGZ). It looks like you referenced jacksfilms without making a forehead joke.  
Please correct your comment and include a forehead joke. Thank you."
"We do have a few friends who know. Our families don't.

We hooked up a few times before this when drunk/high, that's about it.

We use fake names. "
Not super often on the attraction tbh I'm bi with a preference for women but as far as interesting goes I could listen to some of these men talk for HOURS and would probably have offered to be their friend if I didn't know how obsessed with having free sex they would be 
"You get everything

Absolutely everything

Also 42"
Back of the line bozo 
"I'm a huge fan of Stars and Stripes murals, especially when they feature any combo of eagles, guns or motorbikes! I'm hoping one day I'll get a gun-toting eagle riding a Harley. In Texas I saw a ""No to Windmills"" sign in an area full of oil derricks, indicating they were a blight on the landscape! :D"
"We're bi, we've had 2 female clients "
I just felt like runnin'...
I've only fell down once so far. Bit my tongue. Swore.
So this is a marketing ploy.. well played!
"Hello! 

I cannot vouch for roles in Harry Potter World - but for every other Park role, you come to an open audition. You just have to be outgoing and animated. Show you want the job and aren't scared to entertain! 

Also having the right look for the part can help :)

Good luck! 



- I don't really have any secrets for HPW, but Jurassic Park the ride has an elevator at the top of the ending drop. Steven Spielberg had it built for himself because he doesn't like the drop. If he ever rides it, he gets off at the top before the drop "
"Your v welcome. Vaginal sex is included in a standard booking (you can pay as little as $95 for 20min) Anal sex is deffinately an extra so you would have to pay the standard fee for you time (usually 45m+ so starting around 170) and an extras fee of $150-$250 this is for exactly the two reasons you listed and also because of the increased risk with unexperienced dudes being rough/not prepping and causing physical harm and loads of pain. 

In my 3 years of sex work I have had exactly 3 female clients and they all came with their male partner. I missed a lesbian couple coming into my brothel once though cause I was in a booking so I'm not giving up on the dream lmao. 

I've had clients ask to watch me masturbate and that's no problem, hell sometimes I even offer to show them where they're going wrong. Blade stuff is a fettish and I would def charge for it. I've had golden shower requests but I can't pee on demand so I've always turned them down.

"The USA, the biggest legal obstacle is that it's illegal. "

"Old miserable shrew of a boss had a bunch of dumb rules to try and make the establishment ""classy"" (only one girl wearing black, no visible lingerie, no red lipstick blah blah blah) and would threaten to fire girls who left shift early for any reason. She also would let bad clients back in when the girl who reported them wasn't working. I hear she can't get working girls anymore and has lowered her rates ^_^ I wish her all the worst "
"I had done an indie porn shoot to cover some extra bills and decided that I didn't care about having sex with strangers so the brothel seemed like the logical next step.I did a lot googling and found a brothel that looked good, gave them a call and then went in for an interview the next day. I did my first booking that night and have been going strong ever since. (Although in hindsight that brothel was garbage) "
"Hooker and whore really bother me when other people say them(i use them to refer to myself around other sex workers) . Prostitute makes me roll my eyes but doesn't bother me. I prefer sex worker above all else but ""working girl"" works just as well in most contexts  "
"Absolutely. My accountant was recommended to me by a client, I also lived in a rental property managed by a client for a while whilst I was in need of transitional housing. and I learn a ton about other nations history and politics by asking international clients questions. I have a little travel list of places I want to go based on clients stories and as a history/politics buff the first hand accounts of actual events is incredible. "
