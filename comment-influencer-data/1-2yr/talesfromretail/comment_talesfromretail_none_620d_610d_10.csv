"No good deed goes unpunished, I suppose.

He's the kind of guy who would try to order more food if you said you were picking up a restaurant tab."
"So not only does he demand your money but then actually spends 2 hours to wait for the cops to get at most $15 that isn't even his? I wanna see what a person like that does with the rest of his day, I can't even begin to understand that person's thinking process."
"When I worked a game store parents would drop their kids off all the time! 

One day a dad just left his 6 year old in the store and the kid started wailing when he couldn't find his dad. I had to call security and they made an announcement, finally the dad was found in the movie theater. He came over and started yelling at me (16 year old girl) about how I was supposed to watch the kid for him! 

Retail workers are not babysitters dammit!!! 

Edit: people seem to think this is recent. This was years ago, I worked in a mall where protocol was to call security and they would call the cops, and I'm sorry but I don't know what came of this situation. "
"You did nothing wrong. I had a repeat customer harass me at the checkouts at lawn and garden when I worked at a hardware store. 

The last time she had me do a price check on plants. They rang up correctly even thought she insisted they were on sale. Then when the checker came back she said, ""Just give it to her for the sale price"", then the nasty customer said, ""How dare you do that! Embarrass me by having the price checked!""

I nearly lost it and said, ""M'AM! If we took everyone's word for a lower price we wouldn't even be in business!"". I wanted to say, ""If you were so worried about saving face you should have shut up and paid the regular price!"". Thankfully I never saw her again."
"""Stop interrupting me! I'm the one who does the interrupting around here!"""
"If you want to sell stolen goods, very."
"You know it's true because kids are brutally honest before they learn the power of their words, lol."
When she walked away the first time and left the line I would've cancelled her sale. Fuck her and customers like her. You were in the right to say everything you did
Don't know...saw the detective a few times after but he never said anything about it. Probably not. The look on the customers face was enough payback for me.
“Checking their parents out.”  I read that completely differently.
How hard is it to carry ID?
I bet M1 always break every policies just to keep goddamn customers happy. I was seeing red after I was reading this story.
I came here to get mad not listen to your heartwarming story!
In that case change my order from a side salad to filet mignon and lobster and a side salad
"I went to buy my last TV with a measuring tape, ended up leaving with a 50 inch that just barely fit, I was so nervous even though I measured beforehand. Glad you got a positive experience out of that, could’ve easily gone bad!"
"&gt;claims that our other store (about 45 minutes away from this store) allows her to get cash back all the time

Massive red flag there. What's she doing returning so much stuff for cash?"
"After he appeared to grab corporate's # he left. I'm assuming it was him that called the cops, could have been another customer that walked in during him demanding the change. Not 100% sure."
"I don't know why so many Americans are stupid about currency.  I was traveling in Europe in the mid-90s (pre-Euro) and in a castle in the middle of nowhere France came across a group of women from Texas bitching that the tiny gift shop wouldn't take dollars.  Really, ladies?  How many of the stores in your hometown take francs?"
Did anything come of it legally??? Missing some juicy payback
People who tell you that you are being rude tend to be the rudest people. 
That... That is one horrible father. I have a five year old and there's no way in hell I'd be leaving her in a store and walking away.
"TL;DR did your job, sold stuff to kid that kid wanted.  Mom mad at you cause you didn't babysit kid.  Was her name Karen?"
Wow that is a horrible person. It’s hard to believe people like this exist. 
Get a retail job. It won't take long before it's not hard to believe at all. 
"I wonder if there is a market for Uber Pickup.  Pickup trucks for quick jobs like that.  Maybe a small move, buying a couch, what have you."
The thief was(is)his accomplice. Watch and see if they're in the store together or within a span of a half hour or so.
"I had a lady come into my shoe store crying. She explained that she was going to kill herself because she didn't have any good shoes and CPS wasn't going to give her child back because of this. I had recently lost someone to suicide so I was emotional and told her to pick some shoes out and I'll buy them for her. Of course she picks out the most expensive shoes in the store and is immediately fine with no more tears or suicidal thoughts.... she came back a week later telling me she also wants me to buy her the same shoes in a different color. Skrew you, tweaker lady. "
"Right??? Oh lord, how many times I've had a customer tell me to just take their word for it is astounding! I had a woman once who pulled somewhat of the same stunt as this one, where she refuted every price that her clothes were ringing up and after the second time of me calling she said, rather rudely, ""You know, you can just take my word for it. This is kind of embarrassing."" But I shot back, ""Why? Everything that I've called on so far that you said was less, actually wasn't. I can't do that, because you've been wrong each time."" I mean, yeah, it was sassy, but she was very rude. It did stop her from continuing though. I mean, maybe if you weren't so hell bent on ripping off the store, then *gasp*, you wouldn't be embarrassed? "
"At a cafe I once worked at, we had a homeless couple coming up to the tables asking for money. One of the owners happened to be sitting at a table with his family and offered to make them both a takeaway meal and coffee on the house. They take the food and go.

A couple hours later, the wife comes in going off at us over how 'disgusting' the food was and that she had to throw it out (no bringing it back to show us what was wrong with it of course), demanding a refund AND a replacement meal.

Unfortunately that has really tarnished my idea of helping out people in need. I know this is a minority case but to have someone throw it back in your face like that does change the way you look at future situations. "
"Well, your manager is the reason."
I hope the police charged this guy with a false police report. Pretty sizable fine for wasting an officer's time. 
"&gt; We have a butchery, a bakery, ...

...and a candlestick makery?"
"""How YOU doin' ?"" ;)"
"Those are so fucking annoying. I had one gem similar to that in tech support.

""My word document is all strange! I see these weird symbols and blah blah blah"" goes on for a while, I know what her problem is. She seems to have finished talked as there is a pause.


""Sorry to hear about that! But I think I know what might be causing the iss...""

""I AM NOT DONE TALKING DO NOT INTERRUPT ME!""

*da fuq*

then she continues to angrily tell me about how young people (the local IT staff) keep messing with her computer settings and how she thinks they did this to her and blah blah blah.

Old people can be the best, or the worst. I think after all those years of experience at life they have either decided to love or hate it."
I AM THE ONE WHO INTERRUPTS!
Had a lady 2 years ago that needed $20 in gas because she forgot her purse. Wasn't expecting to get paid back because first time I ever saw her then two weeks later manager hands me a letter with $50 in it with a thankful note. Never expecting to be repaid but it's nice when it happens.
"I was walking my 4-year-old nephew around in a playground, when we both spotted a seriously adorable baby chilling. He shouted ""Wow, that's such a cute baby!"". I looked up to the parent with an apologetic face, and she was laughing and nodding. "
"Server: It already comes with lobster. 

Stanley: Not enough lobster. Side order!"
"I occasionally have someone who’s a few cents short on change, so someone behind them hands forward a $5 bill or something. I always hand the extra change back to the person who lent the money.

One time a guy said to me, “what are you doing? That’s mine!” And I said “actually, sir, this woman handed me a 10 dollar bill to cover the 50 cents you were short. That makes the extra $9.50 hers, since you ran out of money.”

He wasn’t too happy."
"We had a couple of kids wreaking havoc in our toy department one time.  Once we corralled them up and talked to them, we discovered that their parents just dropped them off and left.  They were from out of state on vacation.  This was back before everyone had cell phones.  We had to call the police.  They and CPS showed up shortly after.  We figured out the kids had been in the store for a few hours before they got bored and started tearing things up.  While the CPS people were talking to the kids at our service desk, their loving Mommy and Daddy showed up pissed off that their kids weren't were they left them.  Cops arrested them and they left in cuffs screaming at me that they were going to get me fired and sue my ass off.  I laughed my ass off, that was about it.       "
"&gt;In what world do stamps equal money?

Only at the post office."
Sounds like he had a plan and executed it. Is it cold where you live? Might be that he wants to cycle through the jail for some warmth and meals. It happens.
"I feel horrible for his wife and mother. His mom is stuck with him, but I can't imagine marrying a guy who behaved like that. He repeated what you said in sing song, for fuck's sake. What a baby. You handled this way better than I would have. "
"It's because plastic bags are made out of refined oil, which came from dinosaur bones. She probably knew the person you were trying to put her groceries into.

You monster."
Definitely share the stories! It's nice to see people pay it forward. 
"FYI CPS won't take your child away because you don't have good enough shoes. If you spend all of your money on crack so your CHILD has no shoes or clothes or food, that's when they take your kid."
"I was hoping that the manager would come, be asked a question that she didntbknow (or pretended not to know), and then turned back to your sister so she could be the one to give the answer."
"When I was 19 I worked in an arcade (back in the 90's before they dissappeared completely) and every day I'd get someone who would approach me a tell me that I was to mind their kid. I would just say ""No"" very clearly. Anything else and they'd find a way to misinterpret it. When they'd get pissed and demand I watch their kid, I'd just explain that I make change and give out prizes. If they abandoned their child here then I'd call the police. 

I actually had one woman get really angry and say ""I'm not abandoning my child, I'm leaving him in your care!"" I just stuck to my ""No"". She reported me to my manager who kicked her out of the arcade. What is wrong with people. Who attempts to leave their kid with a stranger!

We ended up having to put signs up everywhere ""Employees are not responsible for your children children under the age of 13 must be supervised."" I didn't stop people from trying. "
"Haven't worked retail in years but I always loved when customers quoted fictional laws to me. My favorite was when a guy tried to tell me that I had to exchange a pack of cigarettes for him because, of course, the law said I had to."
She's returning it for cash so she gets cash from credit cards without paying the higher interest rate for cash advances. I'm guessing she needs a drug fix and is willing to commit fraud to get it. I'm guessing her credit card isn't paid off to begin with.
