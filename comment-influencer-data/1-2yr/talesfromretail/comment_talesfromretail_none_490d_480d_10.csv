Aww man you spoke with an AI! That’s pretty dope. I heard a story about this on NPR last week but I didn’t think it would happen so soon. 
I was once evacuating my store because it was *on fire * and people still lined up to buy their books and the idiot cashiers were ringing them up. 
"&gt;But the lady downtown offered me a 15% off!

""So why are you attempting to buy it here then?""

"
"Because the over head announcements don't apply to her &amp; her husband, only to everyone else. This happened months ago at my job. The lights &amp; music were off, doors closed, tills counted &amp; closed. The managers make closing announcements the last hour about every 10-15 minutes. It's 10:15 &amp; my co-worker &amp; I are grabbing our personal items to leave. Then this lady comes up out of nowhere, with 2 arms FULL of clothes. She sets them on the counter &amp; says nothing. My co-worker &amp; I look at each other like ""wtf""? So I tell the lady ""I'm sorry, but we're closed"". She looks at me with a confused look on her face &amp; says ""I know, but I need to be rung up before I leave"". She had 2 kids with her &amp; sends them to the bathroom. Our bathrooms aren't close to the entrance where we were. I say ""Mam, everything's closed so we can't ring you up tonight, our managers made several closing announcements over the intercoms"". I then tell her I can put her large pile of clothing on hold for her until tomorrow. She becomes pissed &amp; starts yelling at us saying we were supposed to wait for her &amp; she wants to talk to a manager. I tell her the manager is in the office doing closing procedures &amp; we can't call her at that time. Her kids come back running &amp; the lady keeps yelling &amp; complaining about how bad we are at customer service. I then have to unlock the door to let her out &amp; apologize again &amp; say thank you. The next day, my manager (a moron) pulls me aside &amp; tells me she got a complaint from a customer saying my co-worker &amp; I had refused to ring her up &amp; she wants us to get in trouble. I explain to my dumb manager what happened &amp; how she can also verify with my co-worker. My manager proceeds to tell me that even though we close at 10, from now on I should stand at the register for at least 15 minutes after to make sure no one else comes in. I ask her how I'm supposed to do this AND put go backs away. She doesn't reply to my 2nd question &amp; just tells me to wait for at least 15 minutes. Meaning I'd have to stay overtime (which the company doesn't want to give us) every time I close. Found out later I was the ONLY employee she ever said this to. So I said screw it &amp; left at my regular time. "
"Maybe its my view of what upscale means, but when I hear ""classy store"" I imagine a place that doesn't allow returns at all because their clients have money to burn."
"""you ripped the dress. I heard you rip the dress. It was not ripped before you went in there. You will be paying full price and never coming back, or I'll be calling the police.""

... If only."
"I used to work in the cage at a high-end casino on the las vegas strip.  One day, a paper bag was found sitting on the counter at the cage.  It had $50,000 in cash in it.  Surveillance was able to figure out which player had left it there, and he was staying in our hotel.  We left him a voice mail, and when he came down to the cage we showed him the bag of money, and he said 'Oh, THAT?!  You can keep it.'  and walked away.  $50K isn't a lot of money to this guy.  It went into our tip pool to be divided among 100 employees. The math didn't check out, and to date it remains a big conspiracy about what management really did with the rest.  "
"I am in auto sales, so I hear versions of this quite frequently. Usually when people are trying to sell us their vehicle.

""Well I have an offer for $2,000 more.""

""Wow, that sounds great. I don't know why you're here talking to me, Id be going back to them right now."""
Rc sounds awesome
The *register* itself (or even the *employee*) could be on fire and you'd still get customers trying to pay for stuff.
As someone who sells phones I can confirm most prepaid customers are absolutely insane.
"Soon? They started rolling out phoning AI around 2016. However, Google bought a company a few months back, which had several patents for AI voicing (accents, ""uhm""'s and ""eh""'s, recognition of tone, etc), so I guess they have been going all in on that front. It'll only be a matter of a few years before AI phone bots are common (and it's gonna be a nightmare for consumers)."
Can't you just do all the labor for no money? You're so unreasonable. (/s)
"I usually try to head them off with ""it's got some questions for you"" or an equivalent. 

Tangent, but I find that just playing with terminology seems to make customers listen a little better. For context, I work at a gas station. 

Customer: ""I'd like to buy a car wash.""

Me: ""Okay, which flavor would you like?""

Customer: ""The pump isn't reading my card.""

Me: ""Let me try, they seem to like me better./They seem to behave better when I'm around.""

Customer: *swipes card before machine was prepared to accept it.*

Me: ""It wasn't in the mood yet, could you swipe it again?"""
"No, sir, you'll be taking the foes and fibbers surcharge."
"I have often thought it would be fun to have magically appearing trap doors.  It would be perfect for this lady.  ""No! You dont get it! How much will you give meeeeeeeeeeeeeee ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"""
"Fuck it, I'd do exactly that, stand at the register like a moron for a full 15 minutes, THEN do the go backs, and all other closing duties, rack up over time, and when I got yelled at, point out that I was just following orders.  "
"The phrase to respond with is ""Can I get that in writing?""  Then your idea is golden."
"People die of exposure, why should I want it?"
I was assistant store manager at a now bankrupt toy store and our store power grid set on fire and took down the area. Smoke coming out of the store and customers complaining that we let in the fire department and not them. 
"&gt;COK: ""Yes, I live on West Angry Lane, but I'm not Shirley!""
NC: ""Um... is Shirley your wife?""
COK: ""Yes.""

Why would he think she would fill it out with his name??"
"“No idea what you millennial dare doing”

 Because It’s usually up to the cashiers/supervisors to turn off all the lights in the store if they decide."
50 people will be eating this cake! Think of the exposure you'd be getting!
RC should be short for Realest Customer.
"I've told this story on another forum, but back in the day I worked at a very cool comics/gaming shop. It was a standalone building with plate-glass windows on all four sides; interior was basically one big room. Current issues were on a rack up front and back issues were in boxes around the perimeter, sorted by alphabetical order and publisher. Compared to most stores we had a TON of back issues, but obviously we couldn't keep everything forever and ever.

We kept having people coming in looking for obscure, years-old back issues. And when we didn't have them, demanding that we go look ""in the back.""

At which point bossman would go to the giant plate-glass window at the back of the building, peer through it at the cracked and broken parking lot and say solemnly ""Damn back. Must have fallen off again."""
Many of the human telemarketers I've encountered in Australia have south\-east asian accents. I assume it's designed to appear to blend in and appear human.
"Idk, if my bank can figure out a speech system that directs me to the correct department in less than 45 minutes, I'll be the first to welcome our new robot o overlords."
"Could be a way of masking odd speech patterns. If they speak to you with a foreign accent, you're more likely to forgive small mistakes."
The choice of an Asian accent seems sort of arbitrary for an American company to use.
Oh how I wish you actually said 800-FUCKYOU
"I live in a rural town with awful local police that take over 30 minutes to even show up.
I honestly would have loved to, I had to bite my tongue so hard."
PULL THE LEVER KRONK!!
"But first get it in writing. Just be like ""Okay boss, I can do that. But first I need that in writing because it was my understanding that overtime wasn't allowed so I want to make sure I get my overtime when corporate tries to deny it."""
"Bruh, I worked at Apple and would have people try to trade in a cracked phone for money

Them: “How much will you give me for this”

Me: “Do to the damage, we will not be able to trade it in for any value”

Them: “What!! You’re f***ing kidding me!! I could sell this on Craigslist for a lot of money”

Me: “I understand, in this situation that’s the choice I would make as well”

Them: “You’re seriously not going to give me anything?? This IPhone 4 still runs great, I paid $600 for it and now you’re telling me it’s worth nothing”

Me: “That is not what I said, but again, here I will not be able to give you any money for the device but we’d be happy to recycle it for you”

Them: “F*ck you!”

Me: “Have a wonderful day”"
"We had another gut the other day that had just come from the hospital and made a scene by laying on the ground while ""in massive pain"". Oh the joys of being located within walking distance of a major hospital. "
"Geez, I need to figure out who this guy is so I can follow him around and pick up the ""leftovers"". I could take months off work to do this and still make it worth my while.
"
I'm just surprised that there *is* a Mrs. CondescendingOldKnowItAll
"My BIGGEST pet peeve! At my store, it cancels the transaction if they don’t hit okay fast enough, so half the time I’m like, “Uh, it didn’t go through, would you like to try again?” and they get all mad and angry because they think they’re getting charged twice, and then once they put it back in I ask, “Did it tell you to hit okay before?” and they’ll say something along the lines of “It didn’t ask me!!!” as if it was the computers fault, and not their own. Or when they don’t remove their card in time and that absolutely horrid chip reader noise happens that screams for them to remove their card and they just Don’t hear it."
I guess from now on you'll be doing a full written inspection of a bike before the customer leaves and have them sign it and keep a copy.
At least she said thank you.  Most of the time you don't even get that.

What's even more shocking is everyone on reddit is an AI.
"Your friend is correct. This does happen to be an establish of sophistication and refinement. As such, we do not traffic with persons of your ilk. Begone, or I shall be compelled to summon the authorities to facilitate your removal."
"You kids today, with your fancy-schmancy electricity and all."
"I had a customer one time get cash back. She was friendly and we were having a nice conversation, and as she was walking away she goes ""oh, my cash back!"" Like I forgot it. I thought for a second and I said ""I don't think I forgot it but I'm not positive."" My supervisor was right across the way and she said ""...do I have to count your drawer?"" The customers eyes got big as I said ""yeah I think so, I'm not sure. Ma'am, can you please double check that you don't have it? My supervisor is going to count the till to see if it's over or not. I'll go check the security camera."" 

So I'm watching the camera and I have it zoomed in on my register. Just as I see myself hand her the money, my supervisor comes in and says that the till is even. We told the customer this and she started to get really frustrated, insisting that she didn't have it anywhere. My supervisor gave my till back and told me to go back to my register, she'd figure it out.

A few minutes later, the customer came to my register and stood a few feet away for a minute. After I was finished helping my current customer, she stepped over and said ""honey, I am so sorry. I put it in a weird place in my purse. That was so silly of me, I hope you don't think I'm crazy or I was trying to accuse you of anything."" 

It was a nice change of pace to have a customer accept responsibility for their mistake!"
