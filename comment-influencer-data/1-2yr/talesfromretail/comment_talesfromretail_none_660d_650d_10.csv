"So your manager would rather piss off an entire line of folks waiting for their turn than a crazy old bat?

You have my sympathies, comrade :("
"Barista here. People do this with coffee all the time! They will order like 12 lattes then complain to me when they can't carry all of them. We have drink carriers, but they only fit 4 drinks. 

How is this my problem? You ordered them?


Your series of decisions led you to this moment where you don't have enough hands for all of the to-go specialty coffees you ordered. 


Our culture would benefit a lot from a sense of self-accountability. "
I think I'd have had the police talk to her.
Some people have no sole.
"¬£3.50 sounds like a pretty damned reasonable price for a brand new scarf.  What blows my mind is, that's the price- what do these people think is going to happen when they complain that it's too much?  Are you supposed to just give it to them for whatever they want to pay?  Some people.,."
"""oh I thought that's how it works, free is free!"". Queue my blank stare as my brain liquefies"
What did she say to that? You ended it too soon! We love the dumb responses customers give here. 
I hope your ditzy co worker apologised to you too.
I love looking back on outrageous customers like this guy. Thinking to myself *yes that really did happen and yes they really did think that would work.*
"I'm not a small child by any means, but being given a sticker is still something that makes any day a most happiest day! 

I hope you always have stickers at your disposal üòä"
"Customers never listen. I say customers warily because this guy isn't a customer, just an idiot. "
"That reminds me of an urban legend going around when I was a kid. Supposedly, someone had bought a dress at whatever department store, and she had a horrible skin reaction and went to the hospital. The doctors tested the dress and found formaldehyde. Turns out someone had bought it for their mother's funeral and returned it, whereupon the store just put it back on the racks.

I don't know much about formaldehyde, but I don't think it works that way. It was supposed to be a modern ghost story, I guess."
Somebody could make money teaching video game technology to old people.
"Should have told her the price was $10 more than what was on the tag.  Then when she says ""Well it says blah blah blah on the tag"", you can say ""Then why ask me to do a price check?"""
Customer service drives sales so there is always pressure to increase customer service.  That translates to we train customers to expect us to be able to overcome any problem or inconvenience that could possibly arise.  Because we have magic.  That's why we work retail.  Because we are wizards.
"how DARE you make me laugh that hard in public.
"
"It‚Äôs free with the contract.  If you end the contract, you have to return *everything*."
"Yup, if that had been my daughter, I would have called the police myself. Little brat needs a reality check! "
"For every person trying to cancel a contract to keep the bonus, there's another trying to return a free item for a refund.

Seems like every time we run a BOGO sale, someone buys two and tries to return one at full price so they can keep the free one. "
And a bright lesson in credit card fraud at the young age of 14.
"Sometimes I wonder what kind of insane logic loop customers like this have to make in order to think like this, or what kind of life they lived in where they've never had to buy shoes or measure their foot size, not even once. Did you live with one pair of shoes your whole life? Did you survive only on wearing socks? Did you assume that any and all products in your life were one size fits all? Tell me your secrets O insane customers from hell. "
"It's not unreasonable to shop for good deals after a Holiday just to save money and prepare for next year.

For example, I buy Valentine's Day chocolate on February 15th, 50% off at the pharmacy.

What's unreasonable is to be a complete psycho bitch about it when the store doesn't have what you want anymore after the fact.

"
"We get this a lot. I don‚Äôt know what happens around holidays yet, but I do know we can‚Äôt leave to help customers anymore, and at the busiest time of the year it‚Äôs just rude to expect someone to do that (especially when they are making commission)."
"I work at a mom-and-pop store too, but we are a hardware store.
Had a guy come in with a project in mind, I helped him find what he needed and explained how it all works. He decided to put all the supplies on my desk and leave.

&gt;Me: Sir, your stuff.
&gt;Guy: I don't want it. I'll buy it online. Much cheaper.
&gt;Me: Ok, have a good one.

He wasted about 20 minutes of my time while I could have been helping someone who intends to buy it. My store has a tough time competing with online retailers as it is and we really appreciate all the business we can get. Anyway, I can't stand people who do this, especially to mom-and-pop stores.
"
"YUCK! Who tries to return something that's been on a dead body?! Like, at that point, just have a closed coffin funeral, or just display the corpse in whatever he'd normally have worn! And I'm kinda scared to know whether he expected that the store would then sell those clothes to an unsuspecting customer......"
"""Don't you know that if someone else is more tired than you, that makes you not tired??"" - OB probably"
"I'm sort of wondering, if you had pocketed it, I feel like he might have begun screaming that he caught you stealing money and making a scene. Maybe even demanding a discount for it......"
I‚Äôm not familiar with how cell phone stores are run but it‚Äôs crazy to me that management would allow one customer to take up 5 hours of time
"Uhm, Mom saw absolutely no problem with her daughter‚Äôs behavior?????"
"Thank you for being so kind, OP. 

Another old lady here who genuinely appreciates you young'uns offers of help-- even if it's just to take the cart back-- not so much because I can't do it myself, but because your thoughtfulness reminds me that gentle souls still exist on this planet and gives me hope for humanity after a long lifetime of disappointment in the craven powers that be. 

 So Thankful for all you sweet kids here on reddit. Here's a big hug from yr Virtual Grandma.  

Eat lotsa turkey!  :)

"I was really naughty and had a co-worker film it from the security camera for me, so now whenever i'm having a bad day i can watch the video of this idiot who embarrassed himself in a full store hoping for money back. Even better is watching my manager and I in the footage literally just refusing to play into it and ignoring it"
"If it makes you feel better, I don't know one couple who had a promise ring that actually stayed together; most of them never even made it to an engagement."
"Haha, this is one of the dumbest shoplifters ever. Did she think that you can only pay once, and anything you pick up afterwards doesn't count? I mean, she does understand that the cashier is watching her and the game's up, right?"
And now her behavior had been vindicated. New pair of $60 pants for free. Not bad for 20 minutes' work.
News flash to all parents: you don't have a monopoly on being tired.
"I didn't blame him for it because by then I was the only one communicating with that customer, so he had no way of knowing that she didn't need them until the end of November. "
oh wow Im sorry youre better than me I would have just walked off I mean its youre last day what are they gonna do fire you
"Seems like the mother needs a parenting check based off of her behavior and example she sets for her child.  Hopefully you'd be a good enough parent to not have to call the police on them to ""teach them a lesson""..instead of maybe ""teaching them a lesson"" through your good example and teachings of acceptable behavior."
"She just wants one of those tents from Harry Potter that takes up no space but is a mansion inside. Why is that so hard? 

I hope she finds one for the dog‚Äôs sake."
What a bitch! Your supervisor and boss aren't much better. 
"Especially because you're not always there, you need a much better communication system between employees."
"From DMV.org   

""If your¬†temporary, moderate, or permanent placard¬†is lost, stolen, or damaged, you must apply for a new one. See ‚ÄúApply for Disability Parking in NV"" above for application details""

Essentially, you are not licensed to print a government-issued permit"
"This is what reviews online are for! So you don't have to go into a store and waste the employees' time when you don't intend to buy from them. I buy about $100 of books online per month, and it's very easy to check the reviews to see if its something I'd be interested in and whether or not it seems to be good. People like this think they are special and should not have to do any work, and should get special treatment, and they're the absolute worst!"
Sounds like that guy was really out of line.
I sincerely hope to the heavens above that she didn't try to make you return it after telling her that.
"Right. It's an ""I promise to think about maybe someday giving you an actual engagement ring, signifying that I might or might not eventually marry you. But in the meantime, we get to have sex, right?"""
"Yes, but if you were on the phone when she came in, it would be a whole different story. You would be the rudest person ever for not hanging up immediately to talk to her."
Too bad you couldn't make him buy them for ruining them.
"Always used to get calls like that on my answering machine years ago when I had a land line.  Message on my answering machine said ""Hi, you've reached &lt;not-Steve&gt;'s residence.....""

People would leave a message ""Hi, Steve?  I was wondering......""
"
IIRC that was in one of the ‚ÄúScary Stories to Tell in the Dark‚Äù books. I haven‚Äôt touched those for more than 10 years
"&gt;W (interrupting me) ""go check the price of this, ill wait here"" doing a go away hand gesture

Me: *Looks at the price tag* It's $blah"
"Then said customer would scream and demand to be able to pay the tagged price. 

Genius!"
I like it when customers come in and when I ask their show size they say they don't know. How do you NOT know your shoe size?!
Oh I have a story! I worked at a grocery store as a bagger and we were closing the store down. On the last day I handed out entire rolls (easily 500+) of stickers to children. Seeing there eyes go wide in disbelief and thinking about how much their parents would come to hate me in the following days is something I will never forget. 
That‚Äôs so gross. 
"If I had a dollar for every time I answered the phone saying ""Hello, thank you for calling [NAME] Pizza! Please hold!"" and then immediately hear ""OHYEAHIWOULDLIKEUHHHHH""-Switches back to guy I was helping first.

Just because you start your order, doesn't mean you're more special than the guy before you. Besides, literally just listening for 2 seconds would be cool too. Oh, no? You decided to hang up and call back? I got caller ID and now im not even going to answer to have you hold. I'll answer when I'm done on the phone and you call back for the third time. Or until you can follow simple requests like ""please hold.""

Act petty, get treated petty. I fucking love working in a small town pizza parlor with laid back owners."
"Indeed, that was cheap for a new item, plus they were rather stylish (I guess. I'm male, I don't know style hehe).

It never ceases to amaze me how often we get ""people"" asking for discounts on items, both donated (&amp; new goods) which are still as good as new. Some even still have price labels on them :/

Worse, those that return things. I don't mean those that tested something that didn't fit, but those that will buy things regularly, despite knowing it won't fit &amp; will come back to refund it. One woman does this nearly every week..."
"Other customers should say something to the customer who caused the line to back up, not the cashier. We can‚Äôt refuse the transaction. "
