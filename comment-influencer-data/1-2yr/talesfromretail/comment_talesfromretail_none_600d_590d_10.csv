"Amex called our bar like 15 seconds after one was used, to verify that it was the celebrity themselves using the card"
Sounds like she'd go insane if she knew how much saffron costs.
I think the hair bleach might have seeped into her brain......
"Well, she‚Äôs too stupid to own a computer, so there‚Äôs that. "
The human equivalent of [this] (https://i.imgur.com/q46L4QH.jpg)
Please tell me he heard the daughter's last remark
"I think you forgot to include the part at the end where you burst out laughing, because I know I certainly did.  Bahahaha!"
"If I remember correctly, you can't order a black Amex (if it's the centurion card). You get invited to use one.

So it's very likely that everyone of these cards has a private customer service/concierge-guy whichs only job it is to care for these people. It's not unlikely that they live track every transaction they do."
"&gt;I'm offering to sell this guy a piece of paper for an exhorbinat amount that he might never even need. Litteraly the most capitalist thing I can think of!

Oh lawdy yes. Haha.

If the item he was actually purchasing was any type of electronics, the chances were pretty dang high it was made in China ... which is, of course, not Communist, so there's surely no conflict there.

"
Poor kids. I predict a lifetime of having to live down being related to such a jerk :(
There's about a 75% chance that was a bunch of squirrels in a lady suit.
"Plot twist: The daughter was psychic, and by causing a scene to get checked out quickly, the old man arrived home in time for the incident predicted to have caused his death. If only he'd waited in line patiently, he would have survived."
"I got this treatment a lot.  The worst part is, that in 8 out of 10 cases, the person is clutching a smart phone while asking me for directions.

I'm like ""The answer to your question, and any other question you can think of is right there in your hand!"""
"There was a co-worker and a customer in front of me listening to my side of it. They had a GREAT time. After I hung up, I told them ""Sorry guys, got to go... I'm posting this on Reddit"""
Or basic economics
"This story annoyed me and I wasn‚Äôt even there 

I think older people are embarrassed to admit they need help with technology sometimes. I‚Äôve seen that happen with my parents, uncle, and grandma. I‚Äôm 25 and still need help with technology but I can understand why they‚Äôre most hesitant to admit it. 

But to go out of her way to blame you is just silly lol "
"There *are* an awful lot of containers out there that were clearly designed by sadomasochistic monsters. 

That being said, I find a way to cope, and don‚Äôt embarrass myself in public. "
Literally the stupidity of some people makes me want to weep. 
"Classic Horde, sold her a Mac for gaming."
I mean he was not wrong. It was kinda funny.
"Psychologist here. I predict that as serial killers, those kids will take pennies as souvenirs from their victims. Unofficial opinion. Lol"
"""absolutely madam, 'ill deploy the helicopters"""
"&gt;TM: ... I'm sorry sir, I have to go, I don't have a lot of time.

I hate telemarketers... and they think *we* have a lot of time?

that was pretty awesome. I wish I would remember to do something like this next time."
"I once had the same type of customer cutting in line and another customer clapped back to him by saying to me,*""Oh, it's ok dear.  You can wait on him first.  It's obvious that he was raised in a barn and never taught basic manners, like how to wait his turn.""*. She ended up with a discount after I took care of rude man.  üòÅ"
"He's probably going to come back later, hoping you're off shift, and return it 'without the receipt' for the $90."
"Additionally, I think you have to have at least $250k in transactions per year to be able to keep the card."
How much does a basic economic cost
"Not too sure about that. Amex might keep them just for the prestige. Like ""Bill Gates uses Amex Centurion"". Nobody cares if he just uses them once a year, as long he does and shows he does.

But in the end we are talking about money that 99,9% of us will never have or never have to care about :D Also this is just beyond Key Account Management. It's like Fort Knox Account Management."
"Ugh. I keep getting ""Our records indicate that your Google business listing isn't verified!"" ones. :C So annoying."
"Yeah, but at least dogs have the redeeming factor of being cute"
"I halfway wonder if she didn't try to do her hair with a jug of *literal*, undiluted bleach....&gt;_&gt;"
"‚ÄúWell, mam, Spice 1 has a soybean base and is processed in a big factory in south Alabama.  Spice 2 is made of dried crocodile scales, only found on the Nile River in Africa.  So they have to find a croc, kill it, remove the hide, sun dry it for a minimum of 223 days, grind it into this fine powder, crate in 55-gallon plastic drums, ship it to the US, to another large plant down the street from the Spice 1 plant, where it it is finally bottled and labeled Spice 2‚Äù"
"That reminds me of a time someone asked me to call 911 for them on the store phone. It didn't seem like anything crazy was going on so I asked why they needed 911. They said they locked their car keys in their car. I was like umm I don't think you call 911 for that but if you like I can look up the police departments other number or maybe a lock smith. 

They said oh I have that number saved. She spent forever trying to figure out how her phone worked and got to the contact information for the town police. It was saved as 911. 

When she called and the operator was like .... you don't call 911 for locking your keys in your car. Then she got transferred to the towns police department as requested. That department said something along the lines of you are not in our town why did you call us?

She started walking out of the store saying something like but you said you would help me if anything happened.

Left me wondering why ask me for my store phone and why ignore anything I said or suggested."
"They need something, and you're the closest person to them, so why wouldn't you have the information? You're just lazy and you really should hand out maps instead of doing your job."
"I loved when they asked for ""the man of the house."" Then I'd just agree and hand the phone to the cat. Was more fun if he meowed in annoyance."
I stood staring at the phone for a good 30 seconds.
What does this person think they'll find in a fucking organic soil? Unicorns?
This is the best! It‚Äôs always really nice to see parents actually parenting their kids :) too many times I have to ask parents to watch their kids and not let them run around wild. 
"I use platinum for my business and my most recent one is actually metal so weird. It is amazing the perks that come with it, more than worth the yearly fee. Travel problem? Call platinum and it is solved.  Want to book an entire trip and have detailed requirements? No problem. Extra baggage on the flight? Free. 

It has really been worth it to consolidate most, if not all business purchases on this card."
"I'd play dumb.
No chicken? Oh no! Let's go look and make sure.... *Slowly walks down aisle*

*Stops and stares at sign*

Oh no! It looks like chickens are stuck on the freeways due to the weather in the surrounding area.

And that's it. I figure if the ENTIRE interaction lasts at least 3 to 5 minutes and is done at the most, 12 times a day that's about 30 minutes of non work. "
Her brain must have been in the leg that was amputated.
"Oh, I can relate. I work for a landscaping company now and people are crazy. 

""YOU NEED TO COME TO MY HOUSE RIGHT THIS INSTANT TO FIX MY SOD. IT'S A MESS. I NEED IT GREEN RIGHT THIS MINUTE AAAAAAAHHHHHEIFUHWEIUHFWJEF."" 

""Ma'am, it's forty degrees out there. Your sod is being affected by the frost. It will look better when it gets warmer. Please trust us.""

""Oh, okay. Thanks! Love you, bye!"""
"I hate it when they argue, then go and ask a second person who says THE ESAKE THING and then they‚Äôre magically okay with the answer. "
Someone needs to tell these people that farmers have been genetically modifying crops for hundreds of years. Bananas for instance look nothing like the yellow things we have these days. 
"Two snaps for the daughters response! 

I HATE people who are like that in lines. I'm the first bitch to tell someone that they can't skip me. Your burrito is not life altering so I doubt you'll die if you wait 10 minutes. Plus it's his own damn fault for getting out of line. It sucks that cashiers can't say anything so I do my best to speak out against the triflin' bastards. "
