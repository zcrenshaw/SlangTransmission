Excellently applied arsehole tax.  Well done!
Maybe the facility can get a refund on the Manager because she was faulty.
A rude customer at a retail convention... he stumbled into the *wrong* neighborhood.
"Well that's destroyed me.

As someone who watched as friends lost one of their children to cancer, I can tell you that your response to Amy's death and her family is just fantastic. People often won't talk about a child who has died and it's really difficult. Thank you."
"*buys knife from store, stabs self*

Your knives are faulty!! I want a refund!"
"At first I was convinced this would end with the dad going off on you for not remembering his number.

Then it turned into a wholesome dad joke and I leave pleasantly surprised."
Those kids will grow up to be those customers that believe we read minds :(
"I like this guy.  He needs just one egg for a recipe he's making.  Or he doesn't eat eggs himself, but he's making breakfast for a friend.  Or maybe he's just sitting at home, and thinks ""You know what I'd like right now?  An egg!""

And so he goes out and gets one."
"I once ordered something online, picked it up in store, and when I got home I realized they forgot to take the security tag off. So the next day I went back and had them remove it."
"For reference, Spanish dialects are about as different as England English vs. American English.

This is akin to someone correcting ""aluminum"" to ""aluminium"", or ""zee"" to ""zed""."
"Not sure how I feel about this tbh. If I bought something in a sale (lets say 50% off) and it broke under warranty(extended or not), I'd expect to get a replacement unit without having to pay the top-up to current retail price. 
Sale or no sale, I would have bought a product at an agreed-upon price, and expect it to be fit for purpose. Honouring the warranty in this case presumes that the headphones were not fit, and liability had been accepted."
"Omg, you're right. I've become part of the problem D:"
This needs more attention
Two people who value education so much.  There is hope for you guys right there! [Sorry I'm guessing US by the term thrift store]
He wanted an expensive suit to feel good about himself. You gave him what he wanted really. Anything cheaper and he wouldn't get to feel like Mr. Big Shot.
"Wish the kids I kicked out had done that, instead they grabbed like 10 friends and hung outside the now closed store yelling about how they'd brick the window."
"We need arsehole tax implemented across the world, come to think of it."
"Idiot: *skin bubbling on hands* Arrrrggggggg!!!!! AHHHHHHHHH!!!!

Manager: Are you ok?!?!

Idiot: To be frank, I’m not a fan of this. "
"No sir.  We are psychotic, not psychic."
"when you work long enough in a business you learn all the sketchy tricks.

after more than 8 years in retail I learned that even the nicest regulars can be petty thieves.

well handled.

edit: my most upvoted comment sounds like a ~~de~~motivational poster quote! "
I can't wait to be old and confused.
"Counterpoint to this thread...this is why I’m always uncomfortable in places where there isn’t a price tag. Pricing is at the discretion of the seller. That’s scary, because your meal may not be the same price of the next customer even if you were a saint at the establishment.

"
Lol at people who think losing one customer will cripple a large corporation. Maybe if it was a specialty retailer that only had a few customers but nah. They have new people rolling in every day. 
"Amy and Sara became my favorite part of Saturdays and even when it became obvious that things weren't going well just by looking at their parents' faces I did all I could to try and get them to smile, even if just for a moment. 

I have two sisters who are teens now and just the thought of losing one of them makes me tear up. "
"Look, just because I let my daughter shop alone with her own money doesn't mean your supposed to sell her anything without my consent!  

I mean...I will call and scream at you if she tries to buy something and you tell her ""no"" but that's obviously for anything that has no impact on my life!  You should have know this ring thing would have been a problem and not sold her that!"
"&gt;her housekeeping supervisor “doesn’t like” the laundry destainer we are supplying them

I'm pretty sure the housekeeping supervisor said something more like ""IT BURNSSSSS"" instead of ""I don't like it""."
"I am now imagining David Attenborough narrating. ""And so the desperate customer wanders over to a food truck, hoping for easy prey. But unbenownst to them, they had entered the primary den of the Retail Worker"""
(looks at knife protruding from abdomen)  I'm sorry but I can't offer a refund as the knife appears to be preforming it's function.
Gave him that sense of pride and accomplishment.
Automated moving curbs are the way of the future
"If the headphones were on sale right now, and she had paid full price for them 2 years ago, would they have given her the extra money back? Hell no. 

She should have gotten a straight exchange - it's not her fault the store decided to put them on sale 2 years ago. A warranty is a warranty on the product, not the price. 

"
You are a better person than me... I would have flipped!  I mean considering how dangerous and unsanitary simply walking into the bakery I worked on would have been!  
"This. I have gotten home from the store with security tags still on before.  I paid for the item and had my receipt, so I was able to go back and have them remove the tag."
"&gt; You people need to get unionized.

What does that have to do with anything at all?"
Things are worth what people are willing to pay for them.
"&gt;as different as England English vs. American English.

Tha cant be comparin wun lingo to anutha whe thes moor than jus wun lad. Teks piss.

"Yeah I agree. Having the warranty implies you will guarantee that this product will last the set time period the warranty spans. If it doesn’t the product will be repaired or replaced with the same model. 

Our store has similar warranties but if you exchanged it under the plan for the same exact SKU, it will always be an even exchange, no matter what price it is today. 

The price only comes into play if you decline the SKU for SKU swap and decide to get a different item. In that case certain plans will allow you to put the original purchase price of the item on a store credit which they can use towards anything. 

Overall I would be disappointed in OP’s plan.  Warranties usually imply same or comparable item. Not cost. "
"Repost in r/dadjokes

This is gold worthy."
"Yep, didn't do anything and nobody showed up, but I called."
"I'm not kidding the exact words she used was ""she doesn't like it"" "
You told him ahead of time it was hand cut. He knew what he was doing.
That amazing at 16 you saw the potential to make money from a customer like that. In our store there are still team members unable to make quick decisions and would more so come to me to vent about an awkward customer. I would use this example if you ever pursue sales in any employment you come across! 
"Which is when you called the police, right?"
"When I was in high school I bought my prom dress from a store and they forgot to take off the sensor. The security system didn’t trigger so I didn’t notice until I set one off in another store (mall). I went back to the original store to have it removed, had a receipt and the cashier remembered me cause it was less than ten minutes later, but for some reason the manager was all sorts of pissy about the whole thing. It took the employee taking the dress with the tag over to the door and waving it through the sensors to show it didn’t trigger it to get the manager to remove the tag. It was really odd. "
Oh she just expects the driver to follow her schedule.. not his own.
It's almost like they wanted you to apologize for the driver's punctuality...
"*Huffy: can you check?*

To be perfectly honest, we’re hiding it back there to keep customers from buying it. We make more money by not selling products. I’m sure you understand."
You should never visit a middle eastern country or eastern europe country then :) many traditional restaurants in Turkey wont have prices in the menu and you are right to be concerned because you can be taken for a ride in most cases.
My first thought was that he was going to egg someone's noggin. But this makes a lot more sense.
"""I'd like to see some eggs.""  
""Yes sir, of course.  Brown?  White?  Maybe an heirloom egg in light blue?""  
""Brown please, I prefer the classics.""  
""Of course sir.  This egg came from a farm in Slovakia, harvested only before the first sunlight.  This is from a farm in Connecticut, from a very wealthy family who'd like to be anonymous.  This one..""  
""I'd like this one.  I sense the chicken's noble spirit.""  
""Shall I wrap it for you?""   
""No, I shall carry it in my breast pocket as befitting its glory.""  
""Take care then good sir."""
Deal!  As long as you agree to push those sticks down to where the customer at the end of the conveyor belt can reach them.
