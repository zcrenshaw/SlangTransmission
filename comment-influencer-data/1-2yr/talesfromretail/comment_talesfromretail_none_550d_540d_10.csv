"Remember, the ‚Äúback‚Äù, whatever that may be, is a never ending abyss with trillions of quantities of all products, and if you say there isn‚Äôt any back there, you are CLEARLY just trying to save some for yourself."
I love these kinds of stories. LOL
"&gt; DC: Puts his card in front my face and shakes it THIS is my CASH, this is considered CASH to me.

Maybe so but the rest of the world considers that a card. "
"When I was a bank teller, a guy came in with a paycheck to cash, and no ID. He wasn't even an account holder, so he needed to show TWO forms of ID, he had none, demanded an exception, even *promised* it was his check....yeah, what?    
So I very nicely explained that I couldn't cash the check without ID---he started yelling that I just didn't want to help *him*. He dramatically flipped open his phone (it was awhile ago) and started dialing the bank's 800-number to report me for not cashing his check without ID.  
""WHAT'S YOUR NAME? I'LL HAVE YOU FIRED FOR THIS!""  
With this, I let forth a joyous cry:  
""It's BETTY! PLEASE TELL THEM I DO MY JOB CORRECTLY! IT'S BETTY! PLEASE REMEMBER!  
!!!BETTY!!!""

"She didn't say she was never shopping there again and you just lost a loyal customer who had been shopping in your store for ~15 years longer than it had been in existence?  

(And, of course, showed up bright and early Dec 26)"
"Hah! I guess that will teach her not to put all her eggs in one basket!

Sigh. It's all I got."
Working in retail has made it so fun for me to call out other customers in stores I'm shopping in. This lady would have gotten a mouthful. 
Even better when they claim to be the Sister/Brother/Wife/Husband of the owner and they are talking to the owner. It's at that point that I start thinking of the old saying about giving a man enough rope to hang himself.
This is beautiful
I love me some hidden mincemeat pie
Best story I've read today. So glad your manager said what he said and didn't lick her arse like many would've done 
"I hate when customers do that. They don‚Äôt understand that different colors and flavors have different UPCs. I also hate when an item doesn‚Äôt have a code and they just say ‚Äúohhh it was like 3.98...‚Äù 
ok and? I gotta scan it. "
"Bad retail drone! Bad, bad! You were supposed to apologize profusely, offer her replacement bananas, a replacement bag, a replacement for her money, a replacement purse to put it in and a replacement in years off your life for the time it took her to realize the bad charge, decide what to do about it, call in about it, and get over the trauma! Obviously! /s"
Not on this occasion lolz. But I did have plenty of that type. Worked at the same store for 11 years. Had a lady once get so mad at me that she got a meeting with me and the store manager and asked that I be fired. When the store manager refused to fire me (because I was right and she was wrong) she swore she'd never be back. She was back 2 days later and shopped there at least once a week until I was gone.
"Nah, the real Satan would have come through your line next and offered to buy your soul in exchange for never having to deal with people like that anymore. Or at least your trainee's soul in exchange for a pony."
"Yeah, I'm sure you're going to hire a lawyer and sue the store, running up thousands of dollars in legal fees attempting to recoup a total savings of $69 *on a TV you haven't even purchased yet.*

Whatever you say, Mr. Romine."
"I'm honestly always amazed when I read how natural it is for some people in the US that employees pack their bags.

Here in Germany a staring match with the cashier starts the encounter, which then leads up to a race to the death where you determine if the cashier is faster at scanning or you are faster at bagging... "
"My kid was a hostess in a casino. A table of jerks came in and started sexually harassing her, stuff like ""why don't you get on your knees..."" you get it. I don't recall how the interaction got to the point of the customer threatening her by getting the pit boss on her ass. 

""Go ahead, the pit boss is my dad. How do you think he's going to like all that stuff you were saying to me?"" Wish I'd seen this go down, I'd have laughed my ass off."
"&gt; Every thursday at around 12am the elder home lets the elderly out

I'm sorry but this is hilarious"
"Yes ma'am, you caught us. We just go into the dairy section and grab a few cartons of whipping cream and make an *ENTIRE* cake with that one ingredient. Just like your cookies are just butter, yet you charge so much for them. "
"I guess you could say that being caught shoplifting...

*puts on sunglasses*

really took the piss out of her."
"Because I‚Äôm a vindictive b-word, I would have taken their box of comics and redistributed it throughout the other boxes so that even if they did come back, they‚Äôd have to spend even more time searching for them again."
That might be the only gift she is getting cause if she acts like that normally I doubt many people have stayed in her life let alone bought gifts for her.
"Like, $16 before tax. I would have been happy to sell it to them, and refund the amount later if they found the warranty info later on but how dare I suggest that"
"&gt;PL: I just want you to know this is really inconvenient for people.

""Yeah, we know. But the bananas just love it, they never complain or get irate so guess what we're going to continue to do...?"""
"Had someone come in to the convenient store where I worked and told me that the owner had told them they could use the employee discount on whatever they wanted in the store.

There was no employee discount, which I relayed to them. They assured me there was, as the owner gives them the discount because they are such good customers.

I responded, ""I find it hard to believe that the owner would know you from Adam, much less give you a discount. He doesn't even pay his own child minimum wage."" She got angry and said she was going to tell the owner how rude I was when she sees him on Saturday.

I asked her where she was going to see him and she said, ""Here! Since he works the weekend shift!""

I assured her that the man claiming to be the owner was not the owner, but rather a retired gentleman that just wanted something to do on weekends. She tried to argue with me and I told her I'm pretty sure I know who sleeps down the hall from me and it definitely wasn't that guy!"
"If there were more managers like that out in the retail world, people like this 'lady' would (maybe) learn the lessons they were supposed to have learned in preschool."
"I hope your state will soon put in the law about plastic bags.. that is so much waste. 

I know here in Western Australia, we are getting rid of plastic bags in July"
My thoughts exactly!
"...I gotta know... how much was this battery worth?

If its sub $20, this is just hilarious.  I hope they did drive 45 minutes!"
"All comics are $1 each, except for the ones in this box behind the counter.

Someone tipped me off that those might be valuable..."
I've asked these kind of customers if and why they think i'm lying to them on purpose and what i would gain from that. This usually defuses the situation.
"*Sees title* ‚Äúthis is gonna be good‚Äù

*Reads story* ‚ÄúI might be working retail this summer what have I gotten myself into‚Äù"
I love when people say they'll contact corporate in situations like this. Corporate is pretty much the force behind the reasoning you couldn't help.
"""It's not my fault that I forgot what day my son is graduating""
???
Uhhh, yeah, it is!"
"Why was the exchange allowed just because he had the receipt? When I worked retail, my store couldn't return or exchange items that were worn unless there was a manufacturing flaw."
"Me: that is a ply rating that some of those BFG's come in but as I said before, they don't come in your size.

C: Yes they do

""Then you won't get them from us. *(click)*"""
"&gt;  Luckily for her she returned in the afternoon to my coworker.

Well damn. I was hoping for an astronomical bill for gas, and every extra scratch/dent you could bill her for."
"Now i want cake. Lemon cream cake or blueberry cheesecake üç∞ or tiramisu or salted caramel cake with butter cream frosting or German chocolate cake or mango mouse cake or chocolate mousse cake or vanilla creme bruler cake or flan.

I'm hungry"
"I'm a sadist, so I like to tell customers that they forgot my face just to make the situation awkward and see their face twist into deep, deep cringe. "
"Exactly. Especially annoying when a customer wants to ""even exchange"" an item in a different color or size or whatever. No can do.

Also it's policy at my store to scan each item, even if it's the same upc. Annoying but rarely takes too long. Cue 

&gt;customer: ""there's 20 sheets of that paper"". 

&gt;me: ""Okay."" As I scan all of them.
"
"Again, we have another prime example of Shopping Associated Lobotomy Effect (SALE), causing the customer's brain to shut down as the process of buying an item is initiated. A functioning human being, reduced to a confused husk in moments. With no known cure, SALE is truly a cruel affliction. "
So you admit your hiding mincemeat pies back there
Kudos to you for standing up to your spineless manager.
"Same troublesome lady, another day: she brought in a dress that wasnt from our store to use it to estimate if another item she wanted to exchange for her daughter would fit. (She bought another dress from my shop before and wanted to exchange that for something else. Daughter was busy and couldnt come down to try in time for Chinese New Year.)  

She asked if she should get a size XS or S. Shop policy is that you can only exchange once. So it was ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô to give her a personal opinion. In case it was the wrong one and she couldnt come back and make another exchange. I‚Äôd be in the wrong. 

Also the dress from a different store wasnt even in the same cutting or design which made things A LOT harder. In the end, she spent an hour in the shop measuring this and that, asking and asking. ‚ÄúWhy are you so scared to give me a definite answer?‚Äù ‚ÄúJust let me know‚Äù 

I just gave politically correct answers like ‚Äúit‚Äôs best for her to come down and try‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs difficult to estimate this way because the cutting is different‚Äù 

Cause when i said ‚Äúi think S would suit better‚Äù. She said ‚Äúbut the arm holes would be too loose.‚Äù

And when i said ‚Äúhmmm then you should go for XS‚Äù She said ‚Äúbut will the waist area be too tight?‚Äù

LIKE I DONT KNOW HOW TO PLEASE YOU

In the end, she DIDNT do the exchange :‚Äô)"
"It would have taken all my restraint to not snap back at her, ""Then why don't you go buy them there?""

"
