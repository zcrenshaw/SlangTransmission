"&gt; She is a very, very mature person

&gt; My girlfriend was positively losing her shit. I mean, riding the cars tail, sighing, cursing, yelling, braking, looking all over the place to find a way to bypass these 2 cars. Finally, she was able to pass and sped past them at 95mph just to make her point while giving the finger.

These two statements are huge contradictios"
"You can't. But you have to decide that when it comes right down to it who matters more? Are you going to set yourself on fire to keep her warm? Are you going to spend *the rest of your life* sacrificing your own happiness in favour of hers?

Thing is, *she's not your responsibility.* She's just not. You're not married, you're not related. She can't force you to accept responsibility for her - you've chosen to take that responsibility on **yourself**.

You block her via any means you can, you ignore any messages that get through, you don't reach out, you **don't fucking sleep with her**. If you're feeling like you have to, you contact the emergency services and tell them she's suicidal and where she is, but do that *once*. It's not your job to make her better. Bluntly, you need to recognise that you can't live your life like this, which means you have to detach from her, physically and emotionally. And you may feel guilty for a while, but you've done nothing wrong. Her pinning her happiness / hope / whatever on you is fundamentally unfair of her. You need to decide whether you're going to live for her, or live for yourself. "
"You said you both ""passed out"" drunk on her bed. Maybe she just thought she and you were a bit too wasted? "
This was the part that got me. After 4 years you're basically married anyways. Nothing changes once the rings are on. 
"Your husband needs to step the fuck up. This woman obviously has control issues. Your husband needs to talk to **his** family, especially his mother. You deserve equal respect, and if Carly continues to be openly hostile towards you they need to do something about it. If they are unwilling then your husband needs to support whatever decisions you make regarding contact."
"At the end of day, your roommate's fiance is able to help her situation of being ""inconvenienced"", your dog is not. It's a detrimental situation for your dog, and as your dog's caretaker, it's up to you to create a good environment for him. Her requests are definitely unreasonable-- if it was a matter of a day or so, that could be debatable, but a week is a little too much.

I say bring it up to him by telling him that having him locked up for an entire week isn't healthy for your dog and that you aren't willing to place him into a situation where he is uncomfortable. Hopefully your roommate will be understanding of the situation-- but I would prepare for that not being the case, as well. Good luck, OP!"
"I’m so sorry to hear it ended up this way. Unfortunately, now you know what kind of person your dad is. Stay strong 💜"
"So what happens when he breaks his promises? He apologizes and that's it? Does he do anything to earn back your trust/respect? What behaviors have you asked him to change? What goals do you set? 

There could be lots of consequences, you move out, you leave stay with your parents, but at this point if you given  him chance after chance, you've just enabled him to treat you this way. He knows that you'll stay even if he breaks his promise. At the root, he just doesn't respect you. "
I'm betting the friend is going to be the type that goes nuts with plastic surgery later in life if she thinks 30 is old. 
"I have IBS and everything upsetting/exciting/scary goes straight to my stomach. It sucks. 

If things aren't getting resolved because of it, I would approach her calmly at another time (not during a fight), and just acknowledge that you know she can't help it, and if she needs a break, she needs a break. However, issues don't go away because she gets upset, and you guys need to resolve the issue later. "
I've never taken my kid to the shop for maintenance. Should I be spending $2k/mo more on this!?
Start looking for a new job ASAP your credibility is permanently shot there.
"Exactly OP, you can't downplay this or make it seem it different than it was. Like I said in my first response, maybe you both deserve someone with a better fit. "
"If they've been together ""for a few years"", at *best* it's a 28yo pursuing a 20yo, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was an a 26yo pursuing an 18yo."
Totally agree.  BF's family has no idea how to raise a dog.
"Agree. Maybe once you become more independent you will be able to have a stronger relationship with your sister. If you are at University and you run out of money, that is a hell of a lot of stress, you might go homeless or without food, and it can stuff up your Studies... 

It sounds like your Mum wanted to control Natalie, not be mother her"
"&gt;When his friends asked him how comfortable he really felt being immersed with ""those people""

Are they still friends? Because holy shit I would not tolerate that..."
"&gt; I’m sure she makes sure she is 100% before she goes to you and suggests them
Yes, he did told her he's been looking on day care and stuff. And I highly doubt she makes sure of anything before going to him.
&gt; When I told her that, she chuckled and said she didn't want kids anymore.
The ""I want kids"" stuff lasted a week. I mean, come on."
"Needs need to be met. That's why they are called *needs.* Sometimes there is a problem where people have difficulty recognizing their needs or differentiating between a need and a want. If my partner says he *needs* expensive gifts every month as proof I care, he is confusing a need and a want. He needs me to show that I care, but we can work together to find a reasonable method. If I say I merely *want* my partner to respect me, I am refusing to acknowledge my own needs.

If you have a need for affection, you date someone willing to show you affection. It's that simple. There could be a situation where you have trouble understanding the *way* your partner shows affection (like if your partner has a different Love Language), but the solution isn't to just *stop needing affection*. Just like if you need to eat 2,000 calories a day, eating only 500 is not acceptable.


As for some of mine, I need my partner to:
* show affection &amp; appreciation (towards me &amp; their friends/family)
* have a job that pays the bills/be financially stable
* be open with their emotions 
* respect women &amp; other minorities

I want my partner to:
* be interested in social justice activism
* like their job
* enjoy partner dancing
* have a good relationship with their family

I have actually maintained a list of dealbreakers since I was in highschool because I know that I am the type of person to overlook red flags just because a person has some of my *wants.* Having a list makes it easier for me to remember what's important and not get swept away in the moment with someone who is incompatible with my life."
"I’m struggling to see why you can’t understand you’re marrying a 21 year old? Yes he won’t be one for life, but he is one now! Everything you’re complaining about it was a typical college student does! You say they act like children and you know what to most people they are! He hasn’t even graduated into the real world ffs. You’re asking him to subscribe to a life of stability and maturity when he just hasn’t had the life experience to get there yet."
Sounds like he is telling you he would basically be a sperm donor.
Just wanna say that something is wrong if a 30 year old male is being supported by his 21 year old girlfriend. Unless he's off work due to injury or something related that is.
"&gt; I did the best I could to help my daughter. My daughter cannot help herself when she gets like this. I don't blame my sister for following us, but she should've been more careful! she was carrying a child for fucks sake. She knew that my daughter kicked and shoved when she was upset.

Maybe you should be more considerate and give your sister the space they need after your daughter killed her daughter. And it sounds like you're more concerned about them being upset with you than coming to terms with what you've really done.

Even if she eventually forgives your family, I wouldn't expect your relationship to ever be the same. Some day they'll want to try for another kid, and even after it's born they'll want to keep your family away lest your menace of a daughter cave in its little skull."
Open it. Don't make yourself suffer.
"If he's traditional, the happy moment he gets to have is proposing to you, not asking for your dad's permission. If that goes against how you feel then your feelings on this matter more than his because it's about you and permission to marry you. It's not about taking something away from him but rather about being treated as an independent adult capable of making her own decisions rather than property of her parents. You should be able to talk to him about this if you think you're ready to marry him. And your feelings should matter to him if he is wanting to marry you.

Perhaps he is just family orientated and would like the family's ""blessing"" before marriage. In which case *both* of you can go to *both* families, his and yours, and ask for blessing before getting married/engaged. That would be a fair compromise that doesn't devalue you as a person but that does honor both your families. 

For me personally, there would be no compromise. My parents get no say and no ""blessing"" in the decisions I make in life, and I married a man who felt the same way and had the same values as I do on matters such as this. So there was no need for compromise. To me, this is such a huge thing - my ability to decide things about my life for myself and there not being even the slightest bit of ownership of my parents over me - that I couldn't possibly have compromised on this or wanted to marry a man who wanted to ask permission to marry me. But you may feel less strongly about this, or your boyfriend may feel less about permission and more about honoring families and bringing families into the process. He may be more family orientated rather than sexist. So you just gotta talk to him about it. Tell him how you feel. He should care how you feel - that should be something that matters to him. And you shouldn't be afraid to talk to him about stuff like this, or else you're not ready to marry him."
"To be fair, Jenny sounds like a shit stirrer so this may be the brother's way of coping. He just stays out of it. "
I guess it depends on the dog/owner. Whenever I've dogsat for anyone they've only asked me to stop by every X hours to let them outside/walk/feed/etc. 
"I don't know why, really. He had a tough upbringing and maybe that's a small part of it but I won't make many assumptions about it. 

We've talked about his spending habits in the past and now he thinks he's better because instead he shops clearance items or sale items or secondhand items. He acts like he's not overspending because he's buying cheaper things, but that's really not the point of it. He now compulsively buys things because ""it was too good a deal to pass up"" but why do I need a $300 vacuum when I already have one? 

"
I think maybe you're not angry enough.
"C'mon man, some people like to keep their personal shit tight on reddit. Don't be rude about that."
"I think this is not the end of the ""honeymoon"" stage. It's your realization that you two are fairly different people. He's really doubling down on making you feel crappy for no reason. He just expects you to be totally cool with his laziness. "
"Next best thing is to take pictures of your room and everything in it while she's gone. That way, if she messes with stuff, you at least have proof.

I don't think you'll need to worry about that, though. She seems like she is just extremely immature. Sometimes, girls bully others to connect with people or seem cool. I guarantee you she'll be surprised when you leave."
"&gt; Is this just my body trying to convince me procreating is a great idea? 

It might well be. Have you ever thought about talking to a counselor to work through your childhood and figure your feelings at the moment out? It might give you more input.

&gt; I really don't think it would be beneficial to share my feelings with my boyfriend at this time since I'm still very conflicted, 

I mean if he asks you what's up, don't you want to be honest?

&gt; Anyone else been in this dilemma? Any books/columns/anything to help me navigate these feelings? 

I'm sure there are subreddits (r/childfree or r/parents) where you'll find people who have been in your position. You could also try other forums and support groups.

Furthermore, if you realise that you want children.... you could figure out if it's biological children you want, or maybe foster kids or even adopt one."
"Unfortunately, there isn't really anything to do except wait.  He'll either reach out, or he won't.  The ball is in his court now.  If you were to keep contacting him, you're more likely to scare him off if he was interested.  I know ""just wait"" is not helpful advice, but it's probably the only real answer here."
"I thought the same thing, but for different reasons. This post kind of reminds me of the classic situation where a couple decides to alternate going to college while the other works to support them. And then instead of honoring their deal the person who got a ""free"" ride and lands a good job after breaks up. They got the enrichment that education provides and suddenly feel too good for their partner to return the favor. 

Here we've got OP who probably was taken care of by his gf to some extent, and then got a kidney to boot, and now feels food again in life and like he has aaaaall these options and his gf is just bringing him down. Meanwhile his gf went through major surgery, gave up a literal piece of herself and is probably needing some time to recover from that. But OP doesn't want to take his turn of taking of her while she's up to his current level and wants to ride his high and see what else is out there. 

IMHO he's being extremely selfish that a few months of ""fizzling out"" is enough for him to look for greener pastures. Like, was he already feeling like this before she donated? If so then he really is scum of the earth who cheated her out of an organ. If these feelings started shortly after the transplant he needs to really, absolutely do his best to make sure he gives this relationship his all before making the conclusion they're not right for each other. He OWES it to her to take care of her in the aftermath of this sacrifice on her part and to figure out through therapy (individual and couple's) if this relationship is worth it and if his feelings of ""fizzling out"" isn't just the result of a temporary rush from improved health in which he feels like he can do more without or do better than her. "
You’re saying that she should have consulted him before she stopped shaving her own body hair? It was a month. Big deal. 
"UGH. I hadn't even thought of that...he could absolutely start grooming your kids, gaining your trust, and then whenever they are old enough to interest him, boom.

Spine of steel, momma. Take care of your kids. "
Yeah. Whole thing sounds alarmingly weird to me. Why would he just give you 600$ worth of tickets? Very weird. I think you're making the right call. Always trust your gut. 
"&gt; Yeah, I know she knows

Your father was 17, I guess your mother was also a teenager? You might not like hearing this, being a teenager yourself, but teenagers don't really make well thought out decisions. Your brains are not fully developed yet. Your mother probably didn't and doesn't know what she was thinking. She might not have been thinking at all."
"Sounds like he wants out of the responsibilities of a wife and a baby. There's no honor in that, and he knows it. That's why he's acting detached. "
"Yep, they both have exactly the same rights in this scenario--the right to make medical decisions over their own bodies. It's unfair that men don't have a say in abortion, but it's also unfair that women have to go through all the pain and discomfort and physical risk that pregnancy and childbirth entail. Biology isn't fair."
"I'm confused.  Didn't you split up already?  That's what ""relax our relationship and just be roommates"" means.

As for my wife, the whole point is that she wouldn't be like that.  When one of us is sick, we put aside any normal grievances because we love each other and it hurts us to see each other hurt.  

You should want to spend the rest of your life with someone whose response to difficulty is to support you, not abandon you or take it out on you.

that's the standard allowance for a sugarbaby 
"It's possible that the company or their real estate and investments or the combination thereof is worth that much, but financial worth isn't the same as liquid assets."

This is so dumb."
Nah it's cool. It's just her personality to be a homewrecking B 
"It might be a constant boundary problem indeed. It actually sounds like your BF and his ex have a good relationship as coparents. And despite the divorce, they still consider eachother family. If one of them needs a favor or someone to look out for another, the other is still there. It seems very nice indeed to check up on her. These are expecations and unwritten rules your bf and his ex apparently have for another, where you aren't included.

&gt;Molly is his co-parent but no longer is he her support system in more than a “for Emma” and for her health way.

It might be that this will always disturb you as you have a different view of their relationship and your own expectations. Have a talk about this. What would happen if you'd become a mother of his child as well? What would he do then? "
"I get your concern but yes, she is the mother of his child and if they are coparenting as well as you say, the are also, in a way, friends. 

I’d be fine with him stopping by. Would I like it?? Nope. Is it technically fine? Yep. Now here’s where it wouldn’t be fine: if it turned into an extended visit. If he was bringing her flowers. If he didn’t tell you he was stopping over, etc. The flu, for some people is intense. If I get the flu, I end up in the hospital every time. So yeah flu is intense, colds aren’t. 

I’d apologize for your initial reaction and explain you’ve had time to sort through your feelings, and you’re open to compromise (ie no long visit, you must be aware, etc etc). 

But if this isn’t a dynamic you can live with that’s okay too. "
"That is not a joke!!! For real go somewhere, ANYWHERE, and do not see him again. Go to a women’s shelter. Go to the police. Talk to a trusted official at school. But do not ever see him in person or be alone with him again.

Tell your dad so he can kick him out. Also warn him as well because who knows if your monster of a bf would hurt him because he can’t get to you.

This is so so so so so serious. I can’t stress that enough. Your story is going to end up on one of those true crime shows. He’s shown textbook abusive behavior and now he has a gun. Take him seriously. Never speak to that fucker again.

GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT"
"Friendship aside, a business owner needs to know when bad things happen.  This guy coukd affect Steve's bottom line and no owner is going to put up with it.

"Don't be obtuse, 2 wrongs don't make a right. Look at it this way: if a person murders someone, should they go to jail? Yes, probably. What if their defense is they were tired of the way they were treated by society? Yep, still jail. Apply it to your future relationships."
All good suggestions here.  What about changing your room?  Does the roommate who showers have a room that isn't next to the bathroom?  Can you switch rooms with her?
"Write him a letter and tell him the good things that are going on in your life. Tell him you want to make amends with his wife. I think that's the most you can do right now.

The fact that they *can* be reasonable arguments is what makes them such effective manipulation tools. 
"&gt; It sucks not having anything to do everyday but I’m also comfortable with it because having commitments give me crippling anxiety.

How do you expect to have support if you can't make a commitment or open up to someone. How are they supposed to support you if they don't know why or how you are feeling? You said your boyfriend was supportive. Are you living with your parents? They are supporting you. You just can't expect everyone to support you while you do nothing. It's been months, in your own words. In that time, why haven't you done anything? Life needs purpose."
" &gt; And I am horrible with confrontation, to a point where I should probably see a professional about it. I just see this whole situation turning into a shitshow.

Sorry to say, OP, but it's already a shit show. You've allowed your mom to hold your girlfriend in contempt for 3 years of your relationship. You should not have let this go nearly as long as it has.

 &gt; My girlfriend...expects me to have a hard talk with my mom about this.

Yeah, that's reasonable. You need to stand up for her and don't let your mom cry and emotionally manipulate you out of having this conversation.

You two have been together for a while and this relationship is likely very serious as a result. Your mother needs to respect your life and choices and your girlfriend is part of your life and choices."
"The fact that OP gave him multiple opportunities to say ""You know what? I really don't want to go"" and he still insisted on going and now insists on throwing multiple temper tantrums every day that they're there makes it breakup worthy. If he didn't want to go but OP blithely dragged him along, sure, that'd be something to consider. But she flat-out told him ""If this is going to be a chore for you, don't come."" He came knowing he didn't want to and knowing that OP was super looking forward to it. That's practically intentionally ruining this trip for her."
"Thank you for that, it's a very good summary of my situation haha!
Food for thought, definitely."
"Go and talk to a lawyer about your situation and how you can make sure your daughter is provided for... and then get rid of him. Yes, it will suck for your daughter, but she's a lot worse off having this creep in her life than having him out of her life, so it's best to just rip off the band-aid. 

Don't leave the country and don't agree to him leaving the country till the legal/financial side is sorted. I don't even know how you'd find lawyers who can help you with international child support arrangements, but perhaps if you know of any support groups or charities that help mail order brides that would be a place to start. "
That's really manipulative. I wonder if this extreme defensive/manipulative reaction is because she may have been a sex worker as well. I'm so sorry OP. 
"It’s so easy to slowly destroy someone’s self esteem with ‘jokes’. As a kid and a teenager whenever I would dress up or make an effort my grandpa would laugh “yeah you look alright, you almost look human” which is throwaway to me now but as a chubby eleven year old? No. That sort of nonsense (it was relentless) is why I have zero self esteem at 33. What is wrong with people??"
"I should have been more clear - the landlord is sending the deposit to me, not R and A. They waited until the last minute to fill out the 30 days notice paperwork and I didn’t, so I was the one who got to choose where the check gets sent."
"&gt; I don’t know if I’m just being greedy or self-absorbed or what....

Um, no, not at all. It’s actually your sister that’s being greedy and self-absorbed. 

You didn’t mention it in your post, so I’m assuming you’ve never talked to her about this directly, and instead choose to avoid the issue and inconvenience yourself (for example, waiting until she goes to bed to order food), presumably hoping the problem will just go away on its own. Why is that? It’s unlikely that one day she’s just going to start handing you cash for her half of the order, without prompting, especially since she has no incentive to do so, since she knows that if she complains enough, you’ll just buy her food. 

Why haven’t you said something like, “Hey, sis, I really can’t afford to pay for takeout for both of us, so if you want me to order food for you, I’m going to need you to pay for it up front.” My guess is that you feel if you go this route, she’ll get angry, throw a tantrum, pout, guilt-trip you, etc. Well, let her, and don’t give in. “No” is a complete sentence. Keep repeating it. This is really the only solution to this issue. If you give in, she’s going to keep taking advantage of you. 

Also, it sounds like she’s incredibly financially irresponsible. Do you think you’re doing her any favors in this department by paying for her food? Maybe if she goes hungry a few times, she’ll learn to manage her money and to be more responsible. I really doubt she will die of starvation from missing dinner, if you live in a place where you can get food delivered to your house. 

I’m curious about your overall relationship and dynamic with your sister, especially since you somehow feel that you might be the greedy one in this situation. Where are your parents? Why are you guys living together? Do you feel unable to set boundaries with her, at the expense of your own well being, in other areas of your life? Do you feel responsible for her, being the older brother? If yes, when did this pattern start and are you working on it in therapy? "
"The only sorry she is from you is, ""I'm sorry for your loss."""
"Well, that’s unfortunate. It’s also why I don’t drink at work functions.

Unfortunately there’s not a lot you can do now besides dealing with the fallout and making sure it doesn’t happen again."

"Seriously. I knew a girl in highschool who got teased mercilessly over her huge lips, I can't even imagine how much worse it would have been if she had shown weakness by getting a lip job. Her bullies would have been SO HAPPY to have ruined that for her, too.

"Bluntly, your cousins don't owe you the sort of relationship you seem to want from them. Yes, not RSVPing is kinda rude, but it happens, and doesn't warrant ""so angry I'm shaking"" levels of rage. Honestly i'm not even sure what there is to ""handle"". They're not coming, that doesn't ruin the day or make your husband-to-be any less amazing. Have a fantastic wedding without them and don't invest so much emotional energy in people who don't reciprocate it. But they're not doing anything *wrong* by not coming, or not being as close to you as you want them to be. You may have treated them like sisters, but did they treat you like one? Did they want to be treated like sisters, or have you projected that relationship onto them?"
"He does help with cooking and cleaning and stuff. But yeah aside from that I'm pretty sure it's a bit lopsided.

"You're exactly right. There was a time last month where I came home late feeling absolutely terrible, and it was about the only time I ever refused to tell my mother what was happening. I went to bed with my door locked because I wanted to be alone, but at 7am the next day, my mother woke me up specifically to ask what happened. She said she'd had anxiety the entire night and couldn't sleep because she was so worried about me. Of course, I relented."
"""Friend, I love you and I want the best for you. But whenever I offer solutions for your problems, you make excuses.

"OH. MY. GOSH. 

I just looked up that picture you're referencing and it's probably one of the most awkward, hilarious things I've ever seen."
Because your GF is asking for more commitment from you after 8 years and you are balking at that.  It's not an assumption.  It's a fair conclusion given the facts of your post.
"Girl, the money he makes is marital, meaning it belongs to both of you.  If he doesn't immediately do a 180 in the morning, you are allowed to use marital assets to pay a retainer at an attorney.  Seeing as you are a new mother with a new born, even if he moved out tomorrow and transferred all assets in to accounts only he has access to, in the jurisdiction I live in at least, you would be eligible for an emergency pendente lite hearing for a preliminary alimony and child support award."
"I thought the same. We don’t know for sure that george even started this.

I’d go with a combination of the two because I liked your intro much better. Rather than say “George and I did not have sex,” I’d add “nor did we engage in any sexual contact at all,” because people might think you’re just trying to redefine “sex.”"
But why would he start to doubt his fertility to finally get a test *after* he thinks he gets her pregnant? It's def a troll post.

"I have in-laws from a fairly over-involved culture, (compared to usa). And yeah, my MIL cooks and cleans for hours a day. 

You need to talk extensively about every aspect of child raising - circumcision of males babies (no is a great choice), spanking, sleep arrangements, verbal punishments, feeding, etc. 

My husband was amazing with kids before we had them, but for cultural reasons/because of how he was raised, he found it OK to force feed young kids to eat more food than they wanted to. Like, fighting with a crying toddler at the table to make them eat more food. He also found it acceptable to say “you are an idiot” to kid when frustrated.... vs. “i need you t go to your room and calm down.” He is amazing with everyone’s kid but his own, where he has “standards.”

OP specified he talks to this cousin extremely rarely, and (to our knowledge) the one major interaction they've had in the past few years was initiated by the cousin because he wanted money. How does demanding half of a gift back five years later because it ended up being worth more than you expected not qualify as stabbing someone in the back? You should significantly inconvenience yourself to placate someone like that just because they're technically related to you?"
"I would be devastated if my SO offered me a pass. I don’t want anyone else. Sex isn’t a meaningless physical act to me. I want intimacy with my partner. I would much prefer to find other ways to express our love than for him to give up and tell me to just go have sex with another man. 

When people miss sex with their partner, it’s often the *intimacy* they miss. You can’t find that in another person... or you can, but it would destroy your marriage. "
"He's not like that. He never pressures me to do anything. Even here he says ""do what you want I won't hold it against you."" And I know he won't. He might be a little spineless but he's not that bad and I still love him. "
"You deserved everyone shitting on you in your first post. 

&gt;she said that she thinks she would be ok if I went out and found someone to satisfy me sexually
She does not want that. That is like.. her last resort offer but she definitely does not want that. 

Do you use lube? It was in all the suggestions yet you never addressed whether you would try or not. Have you both gone to seen a doctor? They can provide insights as to why it might be happening. I agree with one of the previous posts comments - its psychological. You can do all the foreplay and she'll get physically ready, but mentally she's either not actually aroused or there's a mental block in her mind."
"Uh, it sounds like he has a history of real serious cheating, not low grade. Now he is lying about attending a sex show. I am shocked you stayed with him after the previous cheating incidents. "
"Good question. This entire thread is a source of bewilderment for me that people stay in relationships with/have kids with/marry people who are so immature that they can't manage to shut up and just do the household chores like an adult, without whining or expecting heaps of praise. Anyone who is not capable of doing 50% of the household responsibilities without griping is a dealbreaker for me. "
"&gt; This wasn’t even occupying my mind until a text from this girl popped up on my phone last night while my gf was over (“hey &lt;name&gt;, miss you” or something like that, I actually deleted it). 

I hope you have told your gf about it. Honesty is key.

&gt; My first thought is honestly to just not answer, but that doesn’t really seem right. 

Why not? If you absolutely want to reply, come up with a reply and ask your gf about it."
"He's told you who he is. And it seems like you know this is a pretty strong need for you.

So he doesn't sound like the right guy for you. You made plans for his birthday even though he doesn't care. He won't make plans for yours, even though you *do* care. 

Nine months in and both of you are already ignoring the other person's preferences in order to suit yourself.

Get with someone who shares your values, it will make life go so much smoother."
"The fact that she's good with money and isn't having trouble isn't why I had trouble with telling her.  It's just the generality of talking about money that I was overthinking about.  Growing up, I was always taught never to brag about money or show it off.  I was just overthinking that this might've come across that way when really it wouldn't have.  I've never received this kind of money just out of nowhere and so I don't know how it is to say ""hey I just got x-amount of dollars as a gift!"".  So I was thinking I was going to play the nice guy role and figure out a way to bring it up without sounding like I was boasting about it.  "
"I dated someone who would get upset and cry every time I approached him with something that was bothering me, and he would say things like ""I'm the worst"" so that it turned around to me having to comfort him and say ""no, you're great.""  It always resulted in the subject being redirected or me feeling like I couldn't finish what I wanted to say, and boy howdy did that get old.  The problem was partly him just being emotional and struggling with depression (not his fault), but also at least partly I think it was a learned defense mechanism that allowed him to redirect everything and never feel ""blamed.""  

I feel like there are two types of ways to get emotional during that type of situation: (1) getting emotional and feeling bad but then still staying on topic and coming back around to directly apologize and accept responsibility, or (2) getting emotional and then jumping on that opportunity to redirect or end the conversation and never talk about it again.  I can't tell from your description which one your boyfriend did, but maybe just something to keep in mind if he tends to get emotional during times you're hurt. "
"He lied to you, he has his friends lie for him, he grabbed another woman's breast (this is 1500000% cheating to me, but that's your decision), and he irresponsibly spent an INSANE amount of money. This guys sucks OP, I'm sorry. "
"I don't think shaving necessarily equals cheating, but if he's cheated before and you can't/don't trust him, that's kind of a relationship killer. It sounds like you have a lot of doubts about both him and yourself. If he won't go to therapy with you, going alone might still help you sort this out."
"If he posts that then he’s indirectly saying he is gay. 

OP just don’t do anything. Don’t even care what people think. Just keep saying to people you didn’t have sex with George, and you don’t want to either. If they think you’re lying who cares. Don’t try to defend yourself, it might come out as you really trying to hide something. Tell then guy who says George doesn’t lie, you don’t care what he thinks or not, and you think what he’s trying to do or saying is disrespectful to you. That once again nothing happens and people shouldn’t jump to conclusions when a straight guy hangs out with a gay guy. That’s just horrible and cliche. "
"I mean, he lets me speak, but he's clearly uninterested and changes the subject back to himself quickly. And the only reason I'm speaking in the first place is because I basically interrupt as soon as I get a rare pause from him.

So it's hard to expect a listening ear from him when I'm not really listening to him either. "
"There's a book called ""The Art of Asking"" which identifies the differences between asking and begging.

This guy is a beggar, he can't be a chooser too. I'd follow the other advice here and just tell him you've gifted him a lot of free stuff already and thinks it should go to someone else in need. You could even say that somebody already reached out to you via PM and got dibs if you want to avoid any potential tantrums."
"It sounds like most of the communication between your boyfriend and his friend may be between texting ehich might be easier for your boyfriend than talking. Regardless this is still hurting you so you need to talk to him about it.

When you talk to him about it, I would use a metaphor. If both your boyfriend and your friend were sick and you made chicken noodle soup for your friend and brought your friend gatorade/ginger ale and brought your friend movies to watch and books to read and all you did for your boyfriend was tell him that you hope he feels better soon, how would he feel? That's essentially what he's doing with you.  His friend is getting the chicken noodle soup, ginger ale and someone to hold her hair while she vomits while you are vomiting at the toilet by yourself. 

It's not that he should not support her, it's that you are his partner and he should be putting more effort and care into you as you should be his priority. "

"&gt; Her proposal didnt mean you were going to get married tomorrow

Before a proposal happens, a couple should agree on a timeline about when they want to get married, how long they want their engagement to be etc. 

&gt; You're being selfish af for your complete disregard of her emotions and feelings. 

He's 21 years old and this is his first relationship. This proposal came out of nothing. You really want to blame him to reject her proposal? Yes, he seems clueless about why she reacted the way she does, but who can blame him? Apparently she made it never clear that she wanted to move ahead."
"Not only is the photoshop comment a stupid lie (notifications wouldn't be going off), but the losing the phone is also a stupid lie.

OK, where was it when op called it? At home? Did he invite his friends over and they posted it, THEN hid his phone all within an hour or so. 

These lies are so terrible it's insane. I'd be more likely to believe him if he said his phone had the y2k virus... "
"Talk to your gf about it first, but I think you should reach out. I once had a concussion, and emailed one of my friends ""FUCK OFF"" for sending me a chainmail. Bad idea. "
"the thing is, here in the US, it's not back in the day. not now in 2017. and we consider getting hitched at 21, while still in college, super young. 

and you're right about married men not partying with other women - well when they're in their 30s and a dad. if you told anyone here in the US you didn't want your 22 year old husband to ever hang out with another woman again, we'd all look at you like you're nuts."
Yeah. My family dog is like this and we all don't mind but don't let her do it to guests! Most people don't like it. 
Then what are you waiting for? You deserve better. Break it off and get tested.
"My husband is 21 (22 on Friday). We both weren’t comfortable with strippers, I mentioned to him that I’m not comfortable - but if it were something he wanted I would survive. He told me that bachelor parties with strippers and cheating are pointless because he doesn’t need a night of freedom, he doesn’t want a night of freedom.  I guess I got lucky not having an immature husband

Either way, your fiancé should at least attempt to respect your point of view and the fact that you don’t want strippers."
"Unfortunately your intent doesn't matter in this case. I don't doubt that you're totally right about his wife but I also don't doubt that all he heard you saying was ""your wife is fat and you two are too dumb to have a kid."" And no, I truly don't believe that's what you meant but I'm not your brother.

This is only a ""hill to die on"" if you think you being right and him agreeing that you're right is worth losing him over. Because it seems clear based on his reaction that it's heading that way already.  

If you do want to salvage things I'd take a reallllyyy hard look at what you posted here for a start. Your emphasis is almost entirely on how you're right and he's not only wrong about his wife's health, he's also wrong to be upset, you're sure he's lying to your mom about what happened, and you're accusing him of using his non-existent child as an emotional blackmail tool to prevent your mother from seeing you.

Then I'd maybe try to unpack what you were trying to accomplish here. I only have your post to go on but you seem like you're expressing a lot of resentment toward your brother, which if he's as irresponsible as you say, I get. I super get it if you also feel like your mom is constantly bailing him out, which also sounds like a distinct possibility.

Weirdly I can totally see how much you clearly love your brother. I highly doubt you'd be posting here if you didn't care that he's hurting. And I completely agree the world would be a far easier place if we could just be honest with people all the time. I mean hell you went to school for years, you know what you're talking about and he's coming to you with this information that's freaking you out because you don't want something bad to happen to him. So you do the ""right"" thing which in this case is unfortunately also the ""kinda shitty hurtful"" thing.

We had a post in here the other day about someone who's boyfriend had an ""enmeshed family"" and things about this post are putting out some of those signals. Its really hard not to feel like you should have a say in your family members lives when you've got your mom reporting back on the state of his fridge and keeping your informed about your brother's ""freak outs"" about his wife's health and how much money she's lending him. 

You can be close to your family and love them and not have every tiny detail about their lives. Sometimes that makes it much easier to love and be with them. Maybe a little distance from all the details and opinions on his life might not be a bad thing?

"He outright said that he has no attraction to women without big boobs (apart from his gf, *of course*). That's telling."
"One of your biggest concerns in this whole situation is that ""it feels like those ""firsts"" have been taken away from me""??? I'd be more worried that my boyfriend is an irresponsible, cheating liar who is in denial about the possibility of being a father and 100% fine with letting some poor guy believe a kid is his when it isn't.

Your boyfriend kind of sucks. I'd break up with him like yesterday. "
"You're right, I do understand that. I told my girlfriend that I do love her and care about her, but the relationship cannot continue how it is now. That we do not get along a lot of the time, I hurt her feelings, she hurts me, and that I want to be with her I just don't think we should. This is when she really started crying and apologizing and I honestly have never seen anyone so sad in my entire life."
"Also, look up the statistics for how likely it is for an abuser to kill their victim once they reach the point of strangling them. The only thing she could have done that would result in a higher statistical chance of her murdering you would be if she had pulled a gun on you. "

"It is in no way ""disrespectful"" to give a gift to a niece or nephew the first time you meet them. Especially if the first time you meet them is Christmas. Where on earth did you get such a bizarre idea?

I think it's nice that your sister wants to give your stepson a present. It seems like your hatred for your brother-in-law has you looking for any way to make him and your sister the bad guys here. "
"So, wait, do you apologize when you're a jerk?  Just because you're going through a hard time doesn't mean you get to be an asshole to people.  Taking that is not being the bigger person, it's being a doormat.  We all have hard times and we all take it out on the people we love, but you should be recognizing it and apologizing for it.

And /u/airaqua gave you some good advice and you summarily dismissed you.  If this is how you handle conflict - expecting validation that you're right as opposed to tips on improving yourself - then you should consider therapy on your own to learn how to communicate."

"It honestly just makes me sad to hear you say this. Of course you should feel empathy for your boyfriend. But the idea that you could't enjoy a holiday tradition with your family because you'd just be thinking about him the whole time makes me feel that you've completely lost yourself in this relationship. 

It's not like you are leaving him when he's in the hospital or having a real crisis of some kind. He's 25 years old -- he can easily entertain himself for a few days, even in a small town.

All that said, I don't necessarily think doing things to ""teach him a lesson"" is healthy either, so I admire the way you are thinking of it. If you think staying home and hanging out with him for a few days will be more fun than going with your family, you should absolutely do that. I just think it's really too bad that the reason you are leaning toward staying home is not something like ""Oh I've done that with my family a hundred times"" but it's ""I'll spend the whole time feeling bad for my BF."" I love my partner but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy myself if I leave him home and go away for a few days with my friends.

"You must have misread.  OP said they're not in the US, so FERPA does not apply."
"You both sounds awful. He's a child who's mooching off you, and you're an abuser who blames her victim for the abuse. Stop buying him the food he wants. He'll either get hungry enough to eat what you buy or he'll change his situation. You're enabling him by giving into his whining. "

"A relationship without physical attraction is not a relationship, its being friends. You should not be together with someone you don't find attractive, and personally I don't even think you are the bad guy here. You developed a preference, and preferences are fine. The only reason why you are so ashamed is because M is such a great guy otherwise. That said, there are other great guys out there who fit your preferences, and you should take your time to find one of those. Otherwise you are just wasting your (and M's) time, because ultimately this relationship won't last."
"You freaking nailed it. What a bunch of misogynistic bullshit. These are so clearly Claire's mom's words and beliefs echoing through her.

"Your boyfriend is utterly sheltered and naive. What happens if you have mixed race children together? Can you trust him to teach them about race issues, problems they may face, or to even stand up for them when someone harasses or assaults them? Or if something more serious happens to you? Can you trust that he can possibly learn and improve his attitude? Ask him that specifically, in fact; if he had a visibly mixed-race daughter how he would feel if someone walked up to him and made some disgusting remark about her and THEN how ready he'd be to ""not stoop to their level"", and how it's any different from his grown spouse defending herself from those very people. This complicit, sheltered crap can't just be fixed with a couple of conversations and some time, and could very well run deeper into much, much more important facets of life. He needs a big old dose of education on The Real World and how his actions (and inaction) are incredibly damaging to people around him he's supposed to care about."
"Damn, whenever I'm thinking about us having a kid this time next year I get so excited I can't stayed pissed off! "

"It is not your job, nor is it within your ability, to fix your dad or your parents relationship, nor is it within your power to protect your sister from most of what you've described. If your parents are violent or abusive you could call child protective services. But there is really nothing you can do about your dad having a temper and being strict.

Your advice to your sister was good, you should do the same thing: focus on academic and career success, then you can support yourselves financially and live independently from your parents.

"Sometimes people's biases make them see things that aren't there. So if they think ""Oh, that's so-and-so's kid"" they start to see their friend in the kid, even if it's impossible for there to be a biological relationship.

"Yeah, your friends are right. Sounds like you've hit the point where you've tried working on your marriage, and he just doesn't give enough of a fuck to fix it.

""This shit""?  You mean betraying the trust of someone you love?  A really long time, if ever.  You are already complaining after 7 WEEKS?  Are you serious?  It hasn't even been two months.   

I don't think you are really trying to earn her trust back.  You are going through the motions, counseling, etc.  But are you really remorseful?  Or do you just want her to get over it already?  Here in this post, it sounds like the latter.  You don't seem to understand why she's so hurt and frankly, it doesn't sound like you really care to.   If that's the case, just break up and work on yourself so you don't do this again.  "
"Sounds like a drag. And he's going to be like this forever. He's not stupid, he knows he needs to pacify you to keep you with him."
I really am afraid to say it but I don't think we are. I don't want this situation anymore. I have no idea how to leave and I'm scared to death I'll regret it but it's like purgatory every day of my life lately.

"I don't think that's the same as ""cutting off"".  If a partner isn't interested in sex for whatever reason, they don't have to have it.  However if they *are* interested but decide to ""cut off"" the activity in retaliation then it's a different situation.  He could have legitimately felt like his girlfriend didn't care if he lost attraction to her and been hurt by that, but this response isn't a healthy reaction to that.  *Talking* about it and working it out together is, which is what u/katttd17 is advocating for here."
"Here's the thing. 

NOBODY who isn't being shady is going to fault you, let alone give you the runaround and all the bullshit your husband is giving you, for asking for actual details before giving money to someone who needs help.

'Hi! My friend needs help. Here's all the details, here's where you can reach them, here's some other people who are helping, etc.'

That? That's normal. And verifiable. Even if you're doing it to surprise someone, there should be multiple layers involved so that everyone knows it's upfront and honest. 

'How dare you not take it on faith, you're being awful to this poor woman who just needs help!' That's the type of language scammers use. People with something to hide; people who are not being honest with you or looking after your best interests.

You can swap this woman's name out and insert pretty much any other cause out there. Veteran with one leg needs new home after fire consumes everything he owns! Here's where he lives, here's his name, here's a copy of the newspaper article covering the fire, hell, you can FOIA-request his military records with the right info to verify he's not a scammer. If he's a scammer, all that info is going to mysteriously be hard to find. Consumed in the fire and he can't remember his SSN or dates when he served or where or branch! Etc.

Your husband, by not giving you a full rundown with all info, and by putting you on the defensive, is acting like a scammer rather than like someone who is genuinely committed to you and to your marriage; not nearly as much as he's committed to giving money to this woman who he doesn't want to be honest about."
"Have you actually tried asking people on dates, or meeting women outside of house parties and clubs? Obviously banging a drunk girl and expecting her to be romantic with you afterwards is going to fail. She banged you, that doesn’t mean she likes you. If you want a girlfriend you (usually) have to ask her out and get to know her, not leap straight to ‘making a move’ on her. You’re focusing on sex way too much - even though you’ve already had it and it clearly didn’t improve your self-esteem! Find and get talking to a girl you actually like for her personality, rather than one whose only attribute is ‘flirts with me/is willing to bang me drunk’, and I think you’ll feel a lot better."

"This is a great suggestion, if your grandfather is open to it. Since it sounds like he still is able to function independently in terms of self-care, he might consider moving into a senior apartment community or manufactured home community instead of a senior care home. My husband’s grandparents live in a really nice manufactured home senior community where they have a beautiful little home with two bedrooms and a yard where they can garden and watch hummingbirds. There is a really good sense of community there. There are constantly activities going on like bingo, weekly brunches and parties and contests. They know all their neighbors and have made friends there who are in a similar stage of life, and also still get to be independent.  

If that is not something he is open to then I think you should encourage him to check out the local senior center, they usually offer free or very low cost hobby classes and group activities where he could make new friends and have guaranteed socialization with safe people his own age a few times a week."

You say this isn't causing her financial trouble at all, that she has her own savings and a high salary - so what's the problem?"

"Everyone else here has touched on how inappropriate and out of line your comments were, so I won't go on any further about that.

What I DO want to touch on is your accusation that your brother is exaggerating and lying to your mother about what you said. While it's possible, I also think there is a possibility that the way he reported it to your mother was the way that he heard/interpreted your comments. That your critique of his wife's weight sounded to him like mocking and berating and belittling. It is obvious that you DO think they are being irresponsible by TTC while your SIL is so heavy, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if that leaked through into what you said to him.

All of this is to say, you might be taking an overly harsh view of your brother and accusing him of immature behavior when in reality he was only venting to your mother about his true impressions of what you said."

"Right?! How are your parents okay with that? Is he the golden child type? Do people (mainly your parents) always excuse his crappy behavior and enable him with whatever he wants? 

"
"cause she knows that would be a deal breaker, but don't think she's happy right now by any means."
"Really?  This sub often has a black and white approach to issuers (place all or none of the blame on OP) and tends to encourage people to avoid backing down to someone who is being a bit unreasonable, however slightly so. Some people will encourage it, but they're often told countered by someone saying the other person will go on to trample their boundaries in the future if they apologize even without much evidence to speak to  that"
"Boy, she sounds like a peach.

If she had stopped at the point where she'd expressed how what you did made her feel, this wouldn't be a big deal.  But the fact that she got nasty and personal not only about your friend, but you as well, and (especially) your friend's girlfriend who had nothing to do with anything at all AFAICT...your girlfriend is showing you that she doesn't want to have a conversation, she doesn't even want to have an argument; all she wants is to *win*, and she'll throw anyone and everyone under the bus she needs to in order to get there.

So yes.  I'd be concerned about how she handled it.

But if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't be concerned about it for long."
"&gt; he actually said he felt like killing himself

Wow, that is genuinely scary, to the point of being abusive.  The only sane response to something like that is to call the police to prevent him from hurting himself."
I'd suggest you leave. That behaviour is extremely unhealthy and I'd be concerned that it could escalate into something worse in the future. 
"Oooh, da wittle baby got his feewings hurt.  (Don't say this to him.)

That's childish and selfish, locking himself in his room and refusing to engage.

You're doing what he wants, which is rattle the doorknob and apologize and try to get him to talk.  He's sitting in there feeling all smug because *he's shown you!*

Stop playing this silly game with him.  Look, he was pestering and pestering and wouldn't cut it out when you told him calmly you'd be done eating in a moment.  He was like a kid hanging onto your pantleg, whining and tugging, whining and tugging.  You didn't do anything wrong by telling him sharply to cut it out.

Leave him alone.  He doesn't want to talk or interact right now.  Don't try to force him.

Leave the house and go do something pleasant by yourself.  Walk in the fresh air, or go buy ingredients to make your favorite dish, or visit the library and look at books and magazines and the CD selections.

Or, you could say through the door, ""I'm going to start playing XYZ video game now, you're welcome to join me if you want.""  Then go and play.

"
"""He seems like he would like pets if only they didn't threaten his profits"".. . Yeah.... That's why he's a landlord and not your dad.  What you've done is awful.  It really is. I can't imagine any scenario in which you'd want to be treated like a child at 20, but that's how you've behaved.  This is a living creature.  "
"IME this sub has a hard time understanding the difference between explaining and excusing, it’s a huge pet peeve of mine"
"Trust me that’s the plans, I have been trying to leave on decent terms but she has been making that extremely difficult by withholding it from me. "
And don't wait until the last possible day in case her estimate is off. If it is a day over the # of weeks allowed they will not let her continue with the procedure. 
I don't know that phrasing it realistically indicates meekness or submissiveness 
"Don’t go stay at a home where a dog lives, then you won’t be inconvenienced by a dog. "
"Exactly. 

They are highly disappointed by her, they thought she was better than that. "
"Right? I wonder how he would feel if she was the one demanding him to quit his job to become a stay at home parent. It could even make more sense if she makes more money, but he shouldn't have to do that, and neither should his wife. 

That being said, it sounds like he gets overwhelmed while she's gone which is totally understandable. A more productive discussion would be about him getting more childcare support while she was gone - maybe hiring a nanny or babysitter or even someone to clean the house."
"And his wife should shut that shit down and have his back. He and his wife are supposed to be a team, together. Instead, it’s her and her family against him. Wife problem."
"He assumed it was something like that. He said he sat next to his new boss and basically built up rapport with him. Everyone there including my husband were new hires. Apparently there were a couple people throwing up, and a mom and daughter duo that were sleeping with all the guys(and some were married). Yuck. "
My suspicion is that a lot of these guys think baby-prevention is a woman’s job. I would be glad to be wrong.
"Unless you actually post a picture we can't say if you're delusional or not.

That said, look around you. There's some pretty ugly people finding love out there and most of them don't have their life together like you do. 


I'm guessing it's the insecurity that's really shining through here. "
"&gt; Did your boyfriend and his friend take any pics for you to rub one out later?

I mean if it works for OP and his wife that's great I really don't mean to judge but ... I find this ""solution"" to be, uh, really weird. I'm baffled that he explained it at just a regular thing and that so many people are like ""psssh, high five, you've got the best wife!!!""

I also have no idea how getting sexy pics of the friend is supposed to help OP get past his crush on the friend?  

Very strange update. "
"Completely agree. To OP I would say that in this case, as hard as it is, mind ya own damn bidness!"
"I'm not sure what that situation has to do with trust.  You went on one date, there's no expectation that you have entered into a daily texting relationship where she has to respond within hours (it's still morning on the east coast...) that she has broken your trust by violating.  Dating 101 dude, don't look so thirsty.  Anyone's interested level at the very early stage is going to be turned off by signs of desperation and assumed intimacy.  Go on other dates and hit this girl up again after the weekend.  If you're picking up women at pet stores you must have options!"
"Can i just say as shitty as this situation was I commend the wife for being so open. ""Or how can you help me?"" Made it so clear she wanted any info you had. Shitty trip for you but you might've saved Her more years of pain with this asshole... so something good came of it"
"Yeah this is one reason it's a very hard industry to break into. (I left for the other difficult reason, the customers, I just couldn't handle the way I was treated anymore. Though I did work at a crappy chain.) It's usually a lot of girls in salons. I really don't want to stereotype us as catty emotional girls...but honestly in this industry a lot (not all) of the girls (and guys) tend to fit in that stereotype. They can be down right mean. I remember in cosmetology school all the tears, the fights, the gossip, the talks with the teachers, the making up, it did help me toughen up a little. The lady I freaked out on, I finally couldn't take her lectures about how bad and slow I was (no she wasn't my boss). Everyone loves to talk about everyone (I'm guilty of this too). We were constantly gossiping about customers and each other. The joke of the salon thing could be anything. I guess we we're just...too bored. People would do stupid things or be jerks and we'd be whispering and giggling. I still wonder what people said about me... I went home crying from co-workers and customers. It's a dramatic, tear filled, intense environment. Man I have social anxiety (I thought I could over come it for this job LOL) and it's making me anxious just thinking about it."
"Honestly, I’ve had a situation like this before, and if he’s anything of a good older brother, he needs to shut that shit down, and you need to have a talk with him about dealing with his wife’s bullshit. It’s unfair that you should suffer because he chose a shitty partner."
I mean apparently he was into giving HER oral... Girl if I were you I have no idea how I’d even begin to get over this. 
"You will never get past this. Especially since you have no reason to do so.

It does not matter that she suffers severe depression. **You are not obligated to suffer the actions out of her depression that end up hurting you**. Remember that. Depression is not an excuse for hurting you, nor is feeling sorry and crying, boo fucking hoo. She has NO justification for any of her actions, thus you have NO reason to forgive her. 

Life is tough, that is why you look out only for yourself and those around you that are worth it. If somebody is hurting you, they are not worth having in your life.. no matter your feelings for them.
"
I think that a 2 year difference is big at your age. Nothing to do with sex. You are both in very different stages and youd be better off finding someone closer to your own age 
Shouldn't there be something on the table that she wants to eat though? I wouldn't be happy if I had to eat greasy unhealthy food every time I hung out with my friends
"Stop trying to avoid the awkwardness. Your mom already makes things awkward by not shutting up. She's already disrespecting you by not giving you a chance to speak.

If you're worried about this and don't want to bring it up in front of your bf's father, then let him know about your mom beforehand and just risk her being a bad conversationalist at the dinner. Find another time to confront your mom about her inability to shut up."
"i would definitely advise /against/ recording her, that's crossing a boundary that will likely escalate things further, not help op in her quest to improve their relationship. she doesn't need evidence, the woman is simply being rude to her, not threatening her life. it's not /that/ big of an issue. it's unfortunate but that's just sometimes how people are.

besides, even if she did record her being rude to her (which i imagine they would have more questions about why op felt the need to record her) the sil could easily say she just wasn't feeling well or what have you when op was talking to her, which was why she sounded apathetic. 

it's worth it for op to approach her sister about the problem in an honest and genuine way, not with tricks up her sleeve at the off chance that nobody believes what's going on. if op's sister and parents don't believe her about these interactions that in itself is a bigger issue than sil snubbing her. 

that being said, op's sister already had a taste of how her wife is treating op when they were at dinner. i'm sure if op told her that wasn't the only time sil had behaved in such a manner towards her she'd realize she was being truthful as she already has an example of that behavior that she's personally witnessed. "
u/princesspea89 is saying it sounds like there's *more* than just a casual dislike. You two are in agreement.
reminds me of that news story recently where some frat pledge died after drinking too much alcohol and nobody even though of taking him to the hospital or calling an ambulance
"Misleading title. How can you state he has no other plans when he clearly has plans to drive 1.5 hours to see his family.  Yeah granted there is no birthday or event he is attending at his family’s home but that’s still plans he made. 

It’s sucks that that you went to his and it’s definitely fair for you to want him to come to yours, unfortunately he does have plans on the day of the party and since you’re the one who got the dates mixed up it would really unnecessary to ask him to delay or change his plans, or guilt him into going by being upset over it. 

Sorry OP! "
I have a coworker who refused to go on a date with a guy because he owned a cat. She said that was unmasculine.
"You are the one who fucked up. Stop blaming your brother for accepting an offer you made. He could be a millionaire and still prefer to stay with family instead. You need to talk to him, it's not your mother's responsibility to fix her grown daughter's issues."
It's all going to blow up no matter what. I agree she should be prepared to leave quickly and possibly have somebody in the car waiting for her in case she needs backup.
More like dress appropriately for formal events and church occasions.....
"If you think that’s he going to cheat at the party, then why are you dating him? If you don’t, then why don’t you trust him?"
"You should get over your irrational fear of commitment.

You also should have had the marriage talk years ago."
What was the dad supposed to do? Never leave the house with the child during the winter? What a stupid hurtful comment.
"It won’t be long until the dog is too big to be picked up and moved whenever, he’s half English mastiff and half Labrador, so he’s gonna be a big boy. Now with that being said, I just am concerned about the dog eventually becoming aggressive if things aren’t straightened out soon. Since it’s finals week, I’ve been in my room studying quite often, and I will bring my dog with my and keep him occupied with a teething ring or something along the lines of that, but Jason has knocked on my door a few times asking where he was. 

The part about where he would claim “the dog likes him better so he might as well keep him” would get shut down very quickly. He’s already mentioned to me once about how the dog likes him a lot, but when I am not there, like I said, he brags to my other roommates about how much the dog loves him. Evicting him seems like a last resort, since it probably is a long and tedious process. I’m going to talk to him about it probably this afternoon and see how that goes before I do anything else. "
"Honestly your friend sounds judgemental as hell. The ""playful bullying"" thing is just a thinly veiled way for her to hurt people. She enjoys it. You need to ask her 100% no bullshit if she really wants to be Maid of Honor and that you sense that she doesn't really like being around you anymore. See what she says.

 If she's really your best friend shell come clean with something, and maybe you can recover things. If she's not, she'll bullshit you and say nothing is wrong. If that's the case you need to tell her that you don't want her to be Maid of Honor. You can't just hold on to this friendship due to your past, you need to evaluate whether it's actually benefitting your life. Don't look at it from a kindness perspective, she clearly hasn't been kind to you lately."
Yeah those are not the right priorities. Did he grow up wealthy? Or did he grow up without much? I wonder if he feels like his son doesn’t need all that money. Which is deplorable because that’s so not the point here. 
"**GIRL!**

Wtf??? How do you feel about the way he continuously disrespects you?!"
"I’ve been with my SO for 5 years. I could tell you how he likes his steak, what he puts in omelettes, his favorite ice cream, his hate for onions...after 5 YEARS I CAN NEVER REMEMBER HOW HE LIKES HIS COFFEE. He drinks it black at home, but if he wants it from a shop I have to ask him. I always feel so bad! "
"A lot of people here are suggesting that she's jealous of your skin/looks that you don't have to wear makeup; that's not it, or at least I really don't think so. 

She and her family have firm and rigid views on how things are done and how you present yourself to the world. As her friend and guest at her wedding, she feels that what you did reflects badly *on her*, since she has an association with you. 

I think there's also a bit of exasperation on her part that, even after having told you how she felt about it, you still showed up without makeup. She doesn't know why you can't grasp this very basic, ""obvious"" social norm and is frustrated with you by it.---writing that as from her point of view, not as a statement of objective fact, though I think she thinks it is objectively true.  This goes back to her ridigity on the subject. 

I think she's wrong, though, you were a guest at a wedding who showed up looking clean and put-together, and I think that is perfectly appropriate for a wedding. She obviously does not agree; you won't be getting an invitation to join that Country Club, lol. "
"To stay safe, I would not confront her at this point. Keep things cordial and professional, but don't consider her a friend any longer. 

Molly, with or without a diagnosis, is just an old fashioned two faced b-word.  She's going to make a horrible doctor, if she even makes it that far.  I'm glad you only have a few more weeks with her, she's not assuming you're going to be roommates again next semester, is she?"
Is it just me or was there a post like this a while ago? Right down to the mother shaming the daughter at a bridesmaid dress fitting? 
"This last week since she followed me screaming that's exactly what I've been doing. No idea if it's helping, but I'll be keeping it up. I avoid them at all costs now.

I'll work on hiding my emotions better. I thought i was really good at it, but constant verbal abuse has a way of wearing me down. And I never thought showing confusion was rude...

I refuse to not speak clearly. But how do I politely tell my boss to piss off when she calls me out on it? She's on vacation this week and expects changes when she gets back even though I already told her politely that isn't going to happen. I'm worried I'll lose my cool as it is a sore subject after the bullying I got as a kid over my speech impediment."
"It sounds like this goes beyond picky eating into some real relationship and mental health stuff. He is refusing to take responsibility for his health. He is addicted to food and alcohol and refusing to admit he has a problem. He is using them as coping mechanisms for stress and using his ""picky"" eating as his excuse. I think he needs to do some therapy to dig into what his real unhappiness is about and learn some better coping mechanisms. Instead of focusing on how to take away his current crutches, focus on helping him find healthier ways to manage stress and then he'll have the resilience to cut out the food and booze. "
"Since you keep making up excuses, then you don't want to help yourself."
"Outstanding. I see too many posters suffering with crappy sex lives. If the sex is bad get out immediately. Your 20s fly by, don’t waste it. "
"Not necessarily true.  I’m 5 7 220 (33) and went to a preconception appointment where I fully owned up to being overweight and that I understood I’d be high risk, so I wanted to make sure I was taking all of the right steps from the beginning, including attempting to lose weight (but I have GI issues that make eating what most people consider a healthy diet very difficult, but Im working with a GI doctor and a nutritionist, but she didn’t know that then) as well as wanting to be affiliated with a hospital specializing in high risk, and she told me that *I* wasn’t high risk, that pregnancies can be,  but it’s not like just because I’m heavy it’s automatically high risk (this surprised me).  She said it’s very possible for me to have a healthy non high risk pregnancy and I just had slightly higher chance of a risky pregnancy so they look out for those issues from the beginning.  I was a bit emotional and said “I’m not already a horrible mother because of my weight?” and she very adamantly said no, and actually never suggested that I lose any, certainly not before trying.  "
"My name is always mispronounced, it's not English/American. However, every time I correct someone or pronounce it for them, I am always told it's beautiful. It makes me feel very proud.

Especially when you joke about masturbating to her."
"If anyone treated my family this way after they were so kind to let us stay for a week, they would be on a bus home, newly single. Your boyfriend is a jerk and you are making excuses for him.  You owe your sister and her husband an apology, not excuses.  "
"If she can't respect your request that she not talk about her romantic history, then maybe she's not a good match and you should break up.

"He should get this checked out. If he's regularly unable to control his bowels, especially if it's a recent change, that points to a medical issue.

Totally agree.  Whatever the intention, it was assault."
"The dad stuff is pretty normal. Honestly sounds like my life lol

But him making plans with you to come to town and not meeting up isn't. If that was the case I would have arranged before you got here a way for my kids to be watched and meet up with you. Worst case those plans fell through I would have reluctantly asked if you'd be ok if my kids were there. 

I agree. My guess is he's still married. "
"I have. I was with my husband for four years before I got diagnosed with the hormone condition that had me suicidal for two thirds of my life, and it was an additional 4 years of treatment before I was no longer suicidal. 

I have said to him verbatim ""I don't feel like I can tell you things because you get mad at me for being sad."" 

I have never cheated. Your fiancee cheated on you because she decided to. That's an action that she chose. Her feelings aren't in her control but her actions are. You may be responsible for her not feeling like she can come to you but you aren't responsible with how she chose to handle that. She handled it badly. "
"If there was so much filth in my home that flies were buzzing around, I would go stay in a hotel until it was cleaned up.

Maybe you should just book yourself someplace nice for a weekend, and just text him, ""I can't live in that filth, I'm staying at a hotel"".  Then see what he says.  But don't tell him which hotel or he'll just come over and make his mess there too."
"Look up JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) and why you shouldn't do it, at least with people like this. You can't stop her being offended, you can't stop her asking to make plans, you can only be kind but firm, and say no. ""She'll insist"" isn't on her (well, not entirely), it's on you for letting her do it.

&gt;she's had exs that left her for being needy, it's a bit of a sore spot.

I bet it is. But it's telling that she's not thinking ""shit, I've had relationships end because I'm so needy, I'd better scale it back a bit"", instead she's got you walking on eggshells over it, and you're just a friend! If you can be bothered, follow up any negative with a positive, as in ""sorry, can't stay for dinner, but I'm looking forward to seeing you next week"" or similar. Only specify a date/event if it's actually something you want to do and commit to though, don't just make vague ""something soon"" plans.

Ultimately though all you can do is plant your feet firmly at a level you're comfortable with and not budge - she'll either learn to be OK with it, or will torpedo the friendship because you can't meet her needs, and if so that's on her, not you. But don't set yourself on fire to keep her warm."
A mature person doesn't deal with negative emotions in that way. She's not mature at all. She's in fact very very very immature. She needs to seek therapy and find a healthier way of dealing with her emotions. 
"I can't get past this. So many people complain they don't have sex for months and this woman making the effort to keep her relationship healthy and having sex at least once a week and she feels bad because he is ""deprived.""

"At first I was going to say that porn is always different from reality and that she will be able to tell the difference, but now that I've read that you prefer that particular feature in real life as well, I am definitely with the others that tell you not to do it. 

But I think this post is actually about more than porn, the real problem here is that you will have to hide what physically attracts you most in a woman for however long you are going to be with her and that really does suck."
"Of course you can't force OP's brother &amp; SIL, or anyone for that matter, to make wise choices. People make selfish, short sighted decisions (like having a child while being unable to support themselves, and too sick from obesity-related illnesses to work, in this case), but you know what? People have an absolute right to judge their poor decisions, just like they've got a right to make them. 

OP's brother and SIL are asking family for money ""for bills"" that they are unable to pay themselves, they're spending it frivolously, and they're planning on trying to conceive a child while they're literally begging family for handouts because SIL decided to quit her job. 

I'm saying that I don't feel bad judging people who make the selfish decision to *intentionally* bring a child into the world that they can't afford. Hell, when I adopted *a dog* they verified my income and employment to ensure that I could support the animal I agreed to care for.

While you can't stop anyone from doing foolish, selfish things like having kids they can't afford *intentionally*, I think defending their choice to make poor decisions is bizarre. Of course no one can stop them. But when you make intentional bad, insanely expensive decisions while asking for handouts, you should not be surprised when people to comment on your poor choices. Which doesn't even address the health aspect at all, which is simply another crappy layer on the sh*t cake that's been described here by OP.

And I didn't ""go after"" anyone. I simply asked if they really believed that adults intentionally having a child that they currently are unable to afford is really fair to the child. I was truly curious about that. "
How the hell can they afford that if they are not in finance or Silicon Valley engineers?
"Well even in this story she mentioned a loss of 600 dollars, so I'm not sure that's fair."
"My sister had a really good childhood and teenagerdom. She had lots of friends, and her need to be liked never made her a doormat. It made her good at coming up with compromise, good at working through issues with friends, and really persistent in getting what she wants. She's just a happy-go-lucky kind of person, who really wants people to like her, and enjoy her company, because they have no reason not to. Obviously, people were mean to her because people are mean, but she was unaffected. She'd do what she could, but if they left her be, she'd leave them be. We sincerely have a very good relationship. If she has a problem with me, she's very upfront about it, because she doesn't like to have those bad feelings fester. The last time she told me she said she had an issue was when I tagged my mom in a Facebook post for their Zodiac (they're both Sagittarius), but not her. She literally called me, saying she wasn't mad, she just wanted to know why I didn't think it fit her. It's a little bit petty, but I appreciate that she tries to address all her issues, so we don't have those ""why are you mad at me"" moments.

I do think that the reasons you listed out might be what's running through my SIL's head, since I know they've been friends for a while. My SIL wasn't really in my sister's friend group in HS (my sister was part of the ""popular kids"" and my SIL was one of the ""weird art kids""), and I remember them arguing about whether or not my sister's friends were good influences on her. My sister's friends were kind of mean, and would use my sister to get information on the people they didn't like, because she was friendly with them. It would make sense that she's still concerned about people taking advantage of her, but I'm not sure if I can see any recent instances where that's been applied.

Thank you for the advice and insight!"

"I'd be firmly telling her that until she is ready to tell you the truth, because in your mind you are assuming the worst possible scenarios, that you aren't going to talking or interacting with her, that this is on her and anyone making such a huge life choice would remember and that you know she is refusing to tell you the truth.

Take her out to dinner afterwards so she can have a reason to get dolled up.  "
"I honestly wouldn't be surprised if you guys even made it to marriage later on down the road and divorced over this. If you think his fascination with Disney is going to go away, it 100% isn't.

Then what makes your wife think he’s having sex at all??? 14 is a bit young. They probably just hold hands and stuff if they are dating like damn let him be a teen

Get some help to get mentally healthy. It's time to get into an honest therapeutic relationship to have someone on your side as you look at your behavior so that you can make new choices.

You could beat yourself up, like this post is doing, and not learn anything but feel better by having punished yourself and then move on with no self-awareness, or you can choose to like yourself and value people around you and communicate with respect.

The amount of contempt you show for yourself and for the people around you is incredible. No one deserves to be treated that way, not even you.

Find something you like about yourself because it is not anyone else's job to like you before you like yourself. Build on what you like, release what isn't working. Like all that bitterness and entitlement to a relationship that you're carrying around."
"Hairdressers can be some of the *bitchiest* coworkers. I've worked in many salons and I've rarely met any stylist who is not a back-stabbing and gossipy, even if fun and lovely as well. Its a difficult environment to work in, and you have to be tough. That being said, these guys sounds especially ass-holey. What's more, its your freakin' hand!! Your money-maker! It sounds like you'll be fine in time, but its putting you out of work and could conceivably affect your career long-term. I'm sorry you are going through this.

Since you'll not be around them for a while, and taking time off work, this will simmer and fester and become ""a thing."" When you get back to work, the best you can do will be to be really strong, and shut people down quickly and sharply when they make any snide remarks. So when Tessa makes a passive agressive side-snitchy comment about it, you call her out. Literally. ""Tessa. You and everyone else's attitude about my hand is old and tired. It was unappreciated in the first instance, given that my hand was injured and you should know thats no small thing in our field, but I let it slide because I didn't imagine you'd all continue to be so persistently mean about the whole thing. If the event at all was remotely funny, that time has passed. Grow up and move on.""

You have to be strong, firm, and more ""exhausted, stern adult"" about the whole thing, as opposed to ""whiny, defensive and hurt."" It shoudl make them feel bad and stupid and childish, and hopefully they will move on. And believe me, there will be plenty of other incidents and gosspiy crap for them to make the next ""big thing"". Salons thrive on drama. Its like being in a series of Survivor. Everyone making alliances with each other and alteranately drinking green juices and doing yoga, and snorting coke in the restroom on a saturday morning. 

Sorry about the husband carrying you element. That does sound like good fodder for making fun of, and I guess lets just hoe it dies with the rest of the embers. Meanwhile maybe consider wheteror not you *are* a bit of a helpless princess. Not that it excuses their behavior at all, but any hindsight could help you moderate future behavior on your part."
"I'd say if you are normally sharing everything, and suddenly hide something like this, its actually more weird and potentially upsetting to her. 

An example, my boyfriend text me good night, every night. If he suddenly didn't, I would be concerned. Not because I need to be told good night every night, but because its a change in a routine. Its the change thats concerning, not the act."
"This may be a late comment but....if you are spending an evening to get dressed, go out and pay for the privilege of dining with someone in any way negative to you, don't. And the gal that had the gall to horn in? Not good. She has little emotional intelligence and is more interested in this little power play in your friend group. I would definitely do as someone here suggested and explain this scene to the others or to whomever is the peer leader/organizer type. If Nancy Negative persists, just cancel. It's very smart of you to post here, btw. Best of luck."
"This is a really good idea. I read your post, and my immediate thought was exactly what /u/Lockraemono said, that your ""normal meter"" is off, and I searched for that phrase and came across this.

Your boyfriend might have been good about helping you stand up to your parents, but now he seems eager to take over their role in controlling your life.

He doesn't seem to want you to have any autonomy, and he has expensive tastes for a poor college student. You do realize that if he wasn't dating you, his standards wouldn't be so high for food and booze, right? He's taking advantage of you.

This relationship has run its course. It's time to end it, and do it *before* Christmas so you don't have to deal with his drama."
"You need to get yourself some therapy and work on improving yourself. As for your ex-fiance, leave him alone. Let him heal and go on with his life. You don't care about him or his feelings. "
"Lol you didn’t make a mistake. If my wealthy brother offered to help me get me a better job, my SO would be like “Can I get some help too?!”

Your brother isn’t offering you money or anything; he’s using his resources and connections to help his family (you) find a better way to earn a living! This is so great. Be grateful to your brother, and be concerned about what your husband is going to teach your kids. It’s okay to ask for help, and receive it too. It’s called NETWORKING. "
"I was going to say, don't prove her anything, start investing in **yourself,** OP.

When you're able to move out start living life for you.  She made a choice to have you, it isn't your fault for any of her choices.

You are here, you are not a mistake, you are you.  You are not beholden to anyone.

Go out in the world, find happiness, and live your life for you.  You don't owe anybody anything."
"&gt; What should I do?

Talk to your husband and ask him what the hell is going on and what steps the two of you can take to change it.

If you don't get a satisfactory answer, it's time to re-think the marriage."
"Just because you see your friend as family, does not mean your family agrees. And your parents are not your friend's parents.

This all could have been avoided if you had planned better. It isn't your parent's fault you didn't check the movie's run time and secure a ride beforehand. Trying to guilt them into something you already knew they wouldn't be ok with just because it's late at night was rude of you.

I think you need to just move on instead of looking for people to say your parents were wrong. That is just a cop-out so you don't have to deal with your own shortcomings."
"I think you should just go straight to a break up. She’s emotionally cheating and has just shown she is perfectly happy to lie about seeing him to you, so she’ll probably lie to you about what happened and will see him behind your back if you stay with her. "
"Honestly it sounds like his behavior is pretty off putting and immature from someone his age.

Having said that it also seems like you enjoy playing cloak and dagger games in a relationship but you need to figure it out - no one has picked up on your “obvious” hints because they aren’t at all obvious.

You need to communicate clearly about what you want, when you’re upset, etc.

It sounds like you bottle things up (though you think you’re being obvious) and then you just end things."
"Yeah, I saw that part. Doing the right thing after the fact doesn't erase the initial wrongdoing. You still cheated on her. "
"I don't mean he isn't an entitled asshole, I just say what an entitled asshole would answer. "
You want to emotionally cheat on your wife and are looking for validation that it's somehow ok? Nope. This means you need to go focus on your marriage (obviously there's things you need to work out together) and stop talking to an ex.
women are all socialized to be like this tbh
"I'm his age, and most people this age left home much earlier than people do now. We did stuff for ourselves. I completely disagree.

It later became a phenomenon about ""failure to launch"" and people staying home with their parents waaaay into their twenties. That was really rare and bizarre when it happened to people now 50+. I only knew one person who spent his twenties living with his parents."
Every single day is part of the risk period because “FAM” isn’t actually birth control. 
"It really depends what the views are. You said they aren't moral conflicts but your boyfriend might disagree with you there. Actually it's difficult for me to even guess what views could be so different and not be a question of morality. A lot of hot button issues that divide Republicans and Democrats like abortion, healthcare, welfare, race / immigration, women's rights, gay marriage, protected social classes etc are very much a question of morality."
"This is veering off topic...but...since you mentioned not being able to afford your antidepressant anymore, it may help you to know that the Walmart pharmacy sells a number of generic medications for $5 a month supply. That includes some antidepressants. "
"Yes but this is a situation of strategy. OP has not been a smoker all along, nor does he need it for medical reasons. He chose to start smoking against his wife’s wishes when their marriage was already doing poorly. And then kept doing it when she repeatedly emphasized that she hated it. That’s not great decision making."
"She's an awful human being. 

Being disabled doesn't mean you can't be rude, arrogant and angry at people. 


She sounds exhausting and quite frankly not worth the effort. Stay away from such a toxic person. "
"What’s a more likely explanation then? People generally have subconscious reasons for being assholes towards someone they usually are not assholes towards and are friends with. 

There’s obviously some weird group dynamic with them where they’re choosing to mock OP instead of confront that they were wrong about how serious her injury was and didn’t react appropriately at the time. They’re doubling down and justifying each other so that their denial can continue. This seems like the most straightforward reason to me, what’s a more sensible possibility?"
"Yeah, these are some concerning signs. She really needs to stop touching you if you ask her to. Can you talk to a school counselor about this?"
"It would have to be through a sperm bank. 

It must be nice to not be concerned with legalities and/or finances, but that just goes to show how naive you are about all of this. If he's serious, he MUST talk to a family lawyer and find out what this really entails.

To put it bluntly, you (all of you) don't know what you don't know. To make a decision this huge, the creation of a life, without finding out what could happen and what needs to be in place legally, is foolhardy. "
"My husband is an immigrant who moved to the states when he was an older child, from a poor Soviet country. He managed to not only graduate second in our high school class, but then went on to get two separate BS degrees (one in math and one in computer science), and then went on to finish his MS degree, and worked full time while doing it. Then he got a job with one of the top 2 tech companies that are insanely difficult to get into. And he is getting a promotion from said job in a few months. 

He smokes pot every single night to relax the way people drink beers to relax after work. And he is one of the most ambitious people I know. He has had this habit since he was in undergrad. It helps him relax and kick back. 

Your boyfriend needs to stop watching cliché stoner movies or needs to stop generalizing what he thinks about people who smoke weed. As somebody who knows a lot of lazy and unemployed people who drink beer all day, I call horse crap.  His idea that drinking two to three bars is superior to getting stoned is weird. How he thinks that makes him less lazy and more employed is beyond me. 

So he clearly must be saying that to himself so he doesn't feel bad about having an unhealthy drinking habit. If he can just point and say ""Oh, well at least I am not like THAT person"", then he doesn't have to take personal responsibility for any bad habits he has. 
"
"Hate to tell you, but the need you seem to feel for drinking is an earmark of addiction. Your boyfriend might have been insensitive in his approach, but I think he has a point. Your rely on alcohol to deal with stress and drink daily. That is not healthy. People often use alcohol or drugs to self medicate. "
"It's new years eve that they're getting married, so I assume everything is much more expensive than that."
"Definitely have a talk when you aren't already angry and make sure he understands this is serious and potentially relationship ending. I have ADHD, I know how hard it is for me to get multiple things done. I love my partner and will take extra steps like getting a white board to remind myself, phone alarms, whatever I need to do to pull my own weight.

If he's truly forgetting he needs to take steps to make sure he remembers, otherwise he just doesn't respect you and selfishly prioritizes the things he needs to do for himself instead of both of you as a team.

You've already tried to fix this on your own, counseling will be a good next step. "
Comparing is a *major* problem for women nowadays. There are so many sources that tell us how we should look and act in bed that it’s super hard to relax and not worry about living up to a guy’s fantasies. 
Lol this has to be a joke. 
"Could also just be an error from his birth certificate that was never caught. Esspecialy given he was born in another country. When moving it may have been lot of hassle to fix the error and just not worth it.
Example I was boring in one city but the doctor put the suburb down not the city. There is however other towns with the same name as the suburb though much further away. I never corrected this as it was never important.

Ask him why his passport has his birthday and birthplace wrong. (Don't ask when in an airport) having that question overheard could lead to issues."
"&gt;actually he's always acting like a child, he's 31 but he's like a child, he's a mommy's boy, he listens to everything she says, 

No offense but that's what you get when you date a 31 year old going after a 19 year old. 

Run, run away. He is a child and will *never* change. "
"He's ostracizing YOU, at work, in front of peers and friends, in order to make himself look 'cool' and impress this other girl. And this delight comes at your expense, you're the foil he's using to show off and ingratiate himself with girl/others. 

That's disgusting. Be disgusted. Get angry. Fuck this puerile childishness."
"&gt; Have I lost him forever?

Probably. If you love him that much maybe you shouldn't have hit him. "
"Everything being great?  He gives you the silent treatment for days if you do something he doesn’t like. He clearly doesn’t believe you’re not into your old boyfriend because he gets crazy jealous whenever you go to your hometown. But he won’t go to your hometown because he doesn’t like small towns. 

This doesn’t sound great to me. "
"Don't stay with this guy. He didn't come clean. He's gaslighting you. He's not contrite. He's blaming you for his actions.

You can't work through this with him. He will just do it again. If he were behaving differently, if the circumstances were different (like he confessed), you'd have a better change of rebuilding trust with him.

Move on."
"A whole lot of religious universities (probably most?) are not even a little bit concerned about the private lives of their employees. It's not like the private primary/secondary education sector. If you haven't been informed about any sort of ""morality clause"" yet, it probably won't be an issue."
OP is American. She said she’s had citizenship for years. 
"I think she met him after he was supposedly in the marines.

So it wouldn't have been necessary for her to have any contact with the army."
"Everyone is saying he's a douche, but tbh you made it v clear to him that yalls relationship was strictly sexual and didn't want to go on dates with him. So I feel like he thinks he's doing what you want and giving you space. I could be wrong but felt the need to offer a different POV"
"They are in their 50s. I know they have taken taxis. Uber is just a taxi company.

"I think dinner and a show is definitely enough, but if you wanted to gift her an object, maybe a cute christmas ornament?"
"&gt; some people just suck when it comes to supporting people who going through difficulties, or have different ideas of what constitutes support. 

I think this is super important. It's possible she figures it's a sad thing and OP doesn't want to hear about it, that she doesn't know how to comfort her, or well, as OP guessed, it's possible she isn't a good friend. I think that it's at least worth a conversation to determine which it is before dropping a friend of so many years.

I also agree with the text message thing... it would be weird to bring it up in the text message. And honestly, if OP's friend is paying for the bridesmaid dress (which it sounds like it might be the case, she said ""it'd save us"" money, not ""you""), it kind of makes sense she wants to save money. Planning a wedding is expensive, and we don't know how big the savings is here. And I understand that OPs friend isn't totally in the right here (she could've asked OP what support she needed), but OP expecting it to be brought up in a bridesmaid group text isn't quite reasonable either."
"When you moved, did you move to a new state? If so, you need to domesticate your custody orders in the new state ASAP."

"If you can post on Reddit, you can use google."
"I agree. While OP has expertise in this area as an OB nurse she is not her sister-in-law's OB nurse. I feel like I'm in the minority but I thought even from the title that she was clearly in the wrong for the reasons you cited. Her comments won't change the situation — while statistically true, there's no reason to say it except to be hurtful. When someone tells you they're ready to start trying for a baby, they expect at most congratulations, not a laundry list of reasons why they shouldn't. It's a rude overstep. (There are also many reasons why a pregnancy could be high-risk or complicated aside from weight. I don't think any of it warrants comment from outsiders.)"
"Does the child's intellectual disability include sensory issues that might mean that HE doesn't want to wear the new clothes, or is sensitive to different fabrics that are not as worn in? That is the ONLY way it would be okay to continue giving the family clothing. 

If you're able to communicate with him, have you asked him what he wants? "
"I'm also thinking there are cameras in the private areas, as well. He just won't admit it."
"""Rush a marriage"" is very rarely a good solution in any circumstance. Long distance isn't forever - what's a year compared to the next 50 years being happily married? Far better to take a bit of time and do it right."
"My family is a hotbed of horrificness, so I get where you're coming from. I resort to bluntness when ""well meaning"" people get too nosy. You want dirt? I'll give you dirt, but don't come crying to me If you can't sleep at night.

""Why don't I see my family often? Aunt1 likes setting up disabled relatives to be r*ped. Aunt2 hid her five year olds molestation. Grandma pimped out her daughters. Would you like to hear about the time Uncle3 tortured a man with a blowtorch? That's why. Don't ask me about my family again.""

Peoole shut up real quick after something like that. You don't have to get as graphic, but sometimes people need a heavy clue-by-four upside the head to get it."
"Because they wanted to do something nice for us and trusted us not to fuck up massively enough to do something that would get us fired, probably. "
"Your wife doesn't get to decide how you feel about an issue. Her mentality is extremely self-centred and toxic. You really need to call her out on this. If she can't respect your boundaries, why did she marry you?"
"Dude, you broke two mirrors. He wants a separation because he's worried your abuse is going to escalate to something physical."
"That will end the symptoms, but not the real problem."
"Today on r/relationships, not wanting your partner to run stop signs makes you abusive "
"&gt; You started dating a 28 year old man when you were just 18

I'm pretty sure she *married* a 28 year old man when she was 18..."
"Even if that isn't his thing, he should discuss it with her. Withholding sex after she's started shaving again as punishment is a different issue"
Very good point

"The meaningful advice you may have missed while doing your various cringes about being a forthright adult.

"
Breaking up with someone when you don’t really mean it but just want to because you’re mad and you think they’ll come back is borderline emotionally abusive IMO. I dated a dude like this when I was young and never again. If you break up with me i’m treating it as a real breakup. 
"&gt; but there are times and places where you wear something that respects the event you are attending.

Imagine that the upcoming fourth happening is what she wears to a funeral. Does she cosplay Black Canary or Zatanna Zatara?"
"&gt; Ex. ""Why did you leave your last position?"" - ""I felt that it was a hostile work environment that I needed to get out of.""

Do *not* say that. That screams to me that you are a possible employment litigation suit down the road and that you don't understand how to interact with people. Here are some better examples:

- ""I left to pursue other opportunities."" [By the way, this is a bit too vague]

- ""There was not as much room to grow at that company from the position I was in."" [You can spin this answer to note lack of promotional opportunities, that you had done well and mastered your current position but there was no opportunity to move up, etc.]

- ""I wanted to find a company with a workplace culture that I would enjoy for years to come."" [Give the implication or follow up to explain that you strongly believe workplace culture is important to you because you want to be able to remain with a company for a long period of time; you don't like the prospect of bouncing around the moment management changes. A good company has a culture that is shared by every employee and manager, and that leads to a great place to work and shop at for everyone, etc. Do *not* badmouth the previous company too hard. If you have done your homework, you can explain how the workplace culture at the place you are applying to is better *without* saying the previous one was bad]

- ""My objective performance indicators were above average [were they?] / top-notch [or whatever is accurate], but my received feedback was that I was under-performing. I am quite open to constructive feedback; no matter how well I do, I always want to do better. But feedback that does not incorporate my actual performance will not help me improve, and I want to work for a company where I can receive feedback that will enable me to constantly improve to newer heights in what I do.""

I think those can work. Perhaps the last one is better (and close to the honest story without explaining that you on-the-spot quit).

Next time, I highly recommend you just stick it out through that conversation, then just try to work in a way to avoid any additional criticism (or getting in trouble) until you can find another job. Tell the new job you need to give your two-week notice; give your two-week notice to the current (shitty) job. Then if you're lucky, the current job will let you go early, and the new job will let you start early. If push comes to shove and the new job *needs* you to start immediately, you can often go to a manager at the current job and say, ""I want to give my two weeks, but I am being asked to start at [X] date at my new job. Is there a way I can do reduced hours, or provide my two weeks and not be scheduled? If not, I understand. If you believe I've done good work and might do so again down the line in the future, I think being able to quit properly would be best."" A good manager might be able to swing that for you. If not, then do what you have to do."
"This is common in China too. Everyone gains a year at Chinese New Year, everyone's born at 1yr old, so people know your age just with your zodiac sign. "

"This is a good thought.

"I've also had the SOs who ""ordered my gift online, it must just be delayed"" and somehow it never ever came and if I mentioned the still-missing Christmas gift in February because I was worried my SO got scammed, they'd just kind of sputter and change the subject, because they never ordered anything at all."
"Asking the father's permission to marry is an incredibly sexist tradition. It comes from the times when people believed that daughter was the father's property and had to get her father's consent before being allowed to marry another man by ultimately her own free will.

Some families might not view asking father's permission favourably, I know that my dad would told me to think twice whether I want to marry someone who needs other people's approval with regards to my own happiness."
"It will be hard for you?!?    Tough shit!   Your WIFE was physically unable to have sex with you for 2 WHOLE months.  You couldn’t jerk off??   You couldn’t be loving or patient.   All you care about is yourself.   You don’t care about her at all.   You wanted to get your rocks off,  got your “pastor” to have your back with your ridiculous sob story and now it’s STILL all about you.   "
You put following the arbitrary rules of a ridiculous fairy tale over the imperative to not do REAL HARM to your WIFE and CHILDREN. I cannot believe the arrogance.
"Yeah, I have an aunt who had a big health issue in her reproductive organs and the doctors told her for years she was infertile. 

Until one doctor, 20 years later, told her that actually she could still get pregnant, although the chances are low. "
"I’m sure I’m going to laugh at that too later.

You would have loved certain bits of our arguments before. Namely “yeah, the electric bill is unreasonably high, but we need to keep the TV on all night for our mental health!” and “you can’t move out because if we don’t live with your dog we’ll have to adopt a new dog for our safety”"
"Holy shit, really? OP is fucked. "
"Had a ""friend"" like that.  She's not a friend.  She sees you as competition and enjoys winning.  Even if that means ruining whatever relationship you may have.  She wants attention and getting it from other people's partners tells her broken mind that she's better then them.  

If you want to maintain a relationship with her you need to call her out.  Tell her you don't appreciate her flirting with your boyfriend.  If she does some thing tell her then and there she's being inappropriate.  If she values your friendship she will watch herself.  If not, well, let's just say I haven't spoken to my old ""friend"" in almost 20 years."
My advice would be to distance yourself from her in every way but professionally. Seems like continuing even a casual friendship with her would only result in more drama and awkward situations. Ignore her immaturity and focus on the job.
"It was a wonderful thing to help a friend in need. And even if she can't see it at the moment, she will be thankful for it. She is near birth and you get nervous, the hormones, yada, yada. Maybe she realised, that it will be hard, and she is going to need help. Maybe you showed her her biggest fear, that she can't handle it alone. And instead of being thankful she is in a frenzy mode blaming you for everything.
It will be tough and to have good friends like you are an enormous support, she shouldn't shove you away. Please don't take it too personal, it's not about you, it's about her. "
"You need to get to couples counselling right now - definitely *before* you get married. This needs to be resolved before the wedding, which might mean postponing it. If he won't agree to counselling then you definitely need to postpone the wedding. It will be a hassle, but less of a hassle than a divorce will be.

It is not okay for your boyfriend to ignore your boundaries like that, and I can totally see why you're uncomfortable. But it could have been a misunderstanding or an accident of sorts - if he was drunk and in high spirits and it slipped his mind. However how he has responded to the whole thing, shouting and being angry at you is beyond unacceptable. He should have apologised and looked for a way to try and make you feel comfortable again. Do not get married to a man who will treat you like that when you have a disagreement.

If this is out of character for him, then I suspect he is freaking out a bit about ""losing his freedom"", is worried about becoming boring and has some anxieties about the marriage. It is normal to be a bit scared by the prospect of marriage, but it shouldn't lead to him yelling at you, it may be indicative of much bigger second thoughts about the wedding on his part - the counselling will help you two figure that out. He may also be feeling a bit guilty, but again he didn't express that in a healthy way at all and so counselling can help with healthy communication between the two of you."
I second this. I am professionally diagnosed with depression and I would never cheat on my SO. Depression doesn't make you cheat. Being a cheater makes you cheat. 
"I don’t know. When I was younger, I found it aggravating when I would complain about my crooked/yellow  teeth and how I needed to get them fixed in front of my parents, only to have them say “oh but you’re already *beautifil* and don’t need to change *anything* about yourself.”

Like...no. My teeth were objectively bad. I eventually went to an orthodontist and he said I almost needed headgear to straighten everything out. I was bullied mercilessly until I got them fixed. I even had a toddler I was babysitting ask me what was wrong with my teeth. I felt like my parents weren’t taking my concerns seriously. 

I can see how parents pointing out things to fix would be upsetting, but I really got tired of hearing that I was pretty just the way I was. I would have loved for my parents to offer a solution instead. I understand that a nose job is a bit different than dental work, though."
"You think that exchanging pics or phone numbers is cheating but sexting isn't? You are cheating on your bf right now even if you don't want to admit it.

Do the adult thing and either break up with your bf for the other guy or stop ALL CONTACT with the guy and tell your bf all about him, and hope he's better than you."
"I feel like I deal with this type of treatment on a daily basis &amp; I rarely ever get visibly upset. I almost never stand up for myself because whenever I do, everyone acts like I'm insane. I can't believe that someone would ever want to bring up something embarrassing about another person in front of ANYONE much less a new partner. My moms excuse was that she assumed we were having sex so she assumed he already knew about the hemorrhoid. "
"Those things are unhealthy for anyone on a regular basis- that has nothing to do with her medical conditions.      When you start saying gluten free and all of the other fad diet names ( I love a keto diet myself for weight loss so not knocking them) it immediately freaks people out because they are so super restrictive.   I think you would make more leadway in actually having her doctor refer her to a dietician who can actually show her what she needs to do and what portion control can do.    When you start saying well you can never have grains or wheat or bread or whatever, right from the beginning she's gonna stop listening.   Work on a more natural diet.  What vegetables does she like? Fruits? Meats? Fish? They even make cauliflower rice now ( which is delicious FYI).  And help her find what portions of what she should be eating.    Start with smaller changes first Bc you come across as very upset over her weight and life style choices but the weigh you re expressing it is going to immediately make her throw up her guard and say no"
"yeah. and the point of that scene was, Alec Baldwin is the head douche of a group of utter douches. we're meant to despise every single one of them but him most of all. So yeah, *that's* the speech and the character your (douche) BF is paraphrasing."
"Totally agree with it. Maybe it's the fact she apparently is a negative person and an asshole, and not because she had a kid. She had plenty of time to be promoted before having the kid, and lots of people love to see themselves as victims rather than looking at the hard facts. "
It probably seemed like the best place that I wouldn’t find it for an extended period of time. And he doesn’t use his trunk much so if I hadn’t been throwing around bags willy nilly it would have been fine. 
"Yeah, that's just being thirsty then :) 

But at one point in university I started going out a couple of hours to a bar with live music and to drink one beer, which was amazing, it helped with stress and made me super social and happy, and it wasn't affecting my school performance because I was only out 2hrs tops and didn't feel like more than the 1 beer a day, I didn't think much of it but at one point one beer wasn't giving me the same feeling so I had two, soon it was 3 and I was staying out later. I realized I had a problem when I didn't have the time and I went anyway, but skipped sleep all together to finish a paper, that's when I realized I was very much going towards becoming a functioning alcoholic. I stopped gradually and it was hard as balls, because I was thinking about how much I craved it all the time. After I went a full year without drinking and without craving alcohol I let myself drink again and now I have one beer if I'm at a party (although I seem to want to drink less and less at parties because I just get sleepy now), but if I hadn't been able to stop, I would have asked for help, I really did borderline need alcohol to function on a daily basis for a while. "
No parent in their right mind is going to give a teenager the combo to a gun safe. Your mom is absolutely making the right call.
"I actually made a lot of use of my school counselling when I was going through the roughest parts with my parents! My first session started like this:
Me: My parents... *breaks down into uncontrollable sobs, never really stops*
Counsellor: *Pushes the tissue box over* It'll be okay.

Those three words made me cry even more lol.

But yes, I definitely agree. Thanks for this - I might make use of my counsellor again come next semester!"
"Hey. I'm gay. And I'm sorry you are in this situation. It sucks. No other way of putting it.


My advice is to make another post reiterating that you are not gay. And while your friends may be well meaning, coming out is a private affair. A gay person outing another doesn't give everyone permission to assume they understand another person's sexuality.

This may sound like an admission to some, but your friends need to understand that they are in the wrong here "
"Right, when someone really loves you you don't need to play a game with them for that love."
"Change your locks! Should have been the first thing you did when your ex said he wouldn't return the keys until you met xyz conditions, maybe even the first thing after you broke up.

For your new guy, let him be for a little while and let him process what happened. If it really doesn't bother him and he understands, he will reach out again. When he does so maybe reassure him that you've changed the locks."
"If one of my direct reports did this, I'd be putting you on a 6 month performance plan and I would be expecting a written apology as well as sexual harassment training.
If there were events with alcohol, I would be expecting you to voluntarily abstain for the next year.
This would also be affecting your performance rating for the year. The way we have it structured is that 50% is meeting your KPIS and 50% is ""leadership"" and behavioral and you'd have failed the latter."
"Are you in the US?  This is relevant, because the laws differ from country to country.

I do not doubt you when you say you are marrying for love.  You say you've contacted an immigration attorney and that person says that marriage is the best way for the two of you to be able to stay together.

This is exactly the kind of marriage that is investigated by immigration officials -- it is rushed, it looks like you are visa-hunting, and you've known your fiance for less than a year.

It *will not help* your case if you try to hide your marriage.  

It will *very much help* your case if you have a joyful open celebration, however small, and present yourself to *everyone*, openly and confidently, as a married couple.

&gt;I either want it to be one or the other - we have a SUPER small wedding now and be done with it - or do the courthouse wedding and get real married in the future.

First, a courthouse wedding **is a real marriage.**  It is **just as real** as getting married in a church or temple with a thousand guests and six officiants and a High Mass and an announcement on the front page of a major newspaper.

&gt;how do I even bring this up without sounding like I don't want to marry him?

You DO want to marry him.  He wants to marry you, too -- he's excitedly telling everyone.  

Look, it isn't a secret any more.  Too many people know.  And trying to keep it a secret didn't make any sense, anyway.  

What was your reason for wanting to keep it hidden and then pretend later you'd never been married?

"
"Yeah, there are way too many potential mitigating factors here. I'd try to contact her, and in person/over the phone so you know for certain you're speaking to *her.*"
"I'd totally agree if it weren't for the fact that her fiancé will be working w OP everyday (provided she still has a job). OP could've done some damage to the innocent couples relationship and the only thing she can do to ease it is acknowledge she was shitty, she knows it, and won't do it again. 

If it were some random girl neither partner would have to see again I def wouldn't recommend contact, just gracefully disappearing. "
"Okay here is what the most logical explanation is:

Pap smear tests by the gyno only look for abnormal cells which can be caused by many different genotypes of HPV. The test only is positive or negative for HPV, but doesn't specify what genotype. The high risk types are 16 and 18, and do not cause gential warts. Type 6 and 11 cause gential warts but are low risk, meaning they are not likely to cause cancer. The gyno must have meant she is a carrier if HPV but doesn't have physical symptoms, the warts. You have a visible wart on the base of your shaft, which is likely due to having been exposed for the first time recently, meaning that she has probably been a carrier for years and you only were now exposed because of either some compromise to your immune system (did you get sick within the past 6 months?) Or perhaps you had a small cut or ingrown hair that allowed the virus to enter when before it did not have a sufficient place for incubation.

Either way, the HPV is not a good basis to assume that either of you has been unfaithful, and both of you should rest assured if you had no reason not to trust the faithfulness of the other prior to this incident that you should suddenly question it now.

"Then talk to church leadership. for all you know, the ladies are there voluntary for CCD on Saturdays (former catholic here). Even if the mass attendees are older, i'm sure they have children. they are catholic after all. Can you mother do some leg work for you talking to other women? i'm not talking about setting up dates, but setting up introductions.

other avenues might include volunteering at christian related charities or even abstinence related charities/groups."
Any reply from her yet?
"I'm not baffled that people like  /u/Dolomite808 and /u/Etorneau are praising him f or having such a cool wife because she gave out suggestive pictures of his crush.

It's the CoolGirl shtick. Guys will praise women for instead of being hurt, upset, jealous, or 'controlling' about his attraction to other women she will brush it off and actively engage it. Such instead of being upset of him checking other women out in public she will point out attractive women and egg him on."
"I think you're putting a lot of blame on women. If a man wants to make sure he doesn't get a woman pregnant he needs to wear condoms- full stop. Many, if not most unplanned pregnancies I would bargain happen when the guy is not using condoms.

(The ultimate point of this is not to put all blame on men but to point out that two people have responsiblity in preventing conception)"
"He's only been working for a month! Give him some time to ""even the score"". If it was 6 months I could see this as an issue, but he's hardly been paid at all yet"
That’s exactly right. If you’re afraid to voice your concerns in a relationship then something is wrong. So many people coming out of abusive relationships think back and realise at how many arguments were pointless and were just used by the abuser to make them feel small. 
"I think this is the real solution. The GF won’t change her opinions, OP’s family won’t change their opinions, and no one wants to disengage.  

OPcan unplug from this though, and refuse to listen to anyone complaining about the FaceBook Wars."

I forgot she said this! 

I'm not too different, I wear little to no makeup, wear some of my brothers hand me downs, and have always gotten along better with boys ever since I was a child. 
BUT that's never stopped me being friends with girls, or at least getting along with them to sit with them during a lousy lunch break! 

And shock! I get along amazingly well with girls who are friends with lots of guys! So I do have girl friends!

OP said this happens often (Im assuming suspicious wives/gfs) because ""she's beautiful and has male interests"". Like no, plenty of tomboys are told they're beautiful, myself included. But I don't have my friends girlfriends or wives push me away or try to cut me out. Maybe because I look like a lesbian?  

OP is doing something weird, either says some ambiguous things or her body language is off. "

"THIS.

College was my ""out"" as  well. I grew up with a younger brother who quickly took on the golden child role (through no fault of his own, honestly) at a young age. 

Every person outside of my immediate family could see it and tried to overcompensate by treating me better, but home life still sucked. I developed an eating disorder as a way to get their attention, although at the time I just thought I was obsessed with weight. 

Then I went to college FAR away on the East Coast and while it didn't magically disappear overnight, my ED became 100 times more manageable and I started to really live my life in a spotlight I was finally able to create for myself. 

I'm sorry, this is such a rough time for you OP, but it will get better. "

HOW. 

With that out of the way, after he launders your bedsheets for you, he needs to step up his cleanliness. If he's so inattentive that he can walk around with shit in his pants and not know it until he performs a visual inspection, he's missing some steps. "

(Google image search ""hollow glass lamp"" to see what I mean.)

A year from now you two will laugh about the time you accidentally broke 1000 dollars worth of puffer fish. I think the jar of broken fish on your mantel would be a great reminder of your boyfriend's thoughtfulness, forgiveness, and love. "
"God I really hate comments like these. He has nowhere to go to talk about this, so he comes here and tries to be honest, and people say ""stop belittling her!! your being judgmental!"" as if she is reading this post.

Lets be real, there is a ridiculous gap here between not knowing how to fix cars and the stuff he listed. Like 99% of people know most of the stuff he listed, maybe 20% know the stock market or how to fix cars. And to not know ALL of those things? At the same time? 

No, something is really wrong. I know you want to stick up for her and all, but lets be real, that is not just 'different interests'. That is an extreme lack of basic knowledge that is just not even close to normal. "
"Oh my God!!!! Litsten to yourself. Are you always as easily manipulated by people as you are by him?  If so then I'm a government official in Nigeria and I need your help in getting a large sum of money out of the country.

Hahaha me too! I just googled it and laughed out loud at my desk.
"""Geeks"" aren't ""defined by the media they consume."" People have genuine interests, and it seems like your boyfriend feels close to you by sharing his passion for these interests. This isn't specific to geeks; it's a type of connection. 

What's concerning is the amount of disdain your post conveys for your boyfriend's passions. Like them or not, people who truly care for each other respect each other's interests. It's not about loving Carrie Fisher, but about loving your boyfriend's happiness.

For all your annoyance, I'll bet your boyfriend feels pretty sad about your lack of engagement with him, and likely, your lack of true connection. And are your needs being met? Have you talked with him about this? It's been 3 years, too long to fly through a relationship on autopilot. "

"You've got some great advice. I just wanted to say, you're nearly 30 with 3 kids, not a teenager, so why are you discussing intimate details of your and your wife's sexual relationship with others? Unless she has clearly stated that's okay, you've committed a big breach of her trust. And for these friends to then give their opinions that your wife's sexual behaviour is wrong...wow! How dare they criticise her? Don't make something so intimate their business. You owe your wife a very large apology and need to tell your friends to butt out. "
How did they take you standing up to yourself? I assume they tried pushing and you held your ground?
"&gt; I guess we should've talked about our timelines. 

Sure, especially if you're with someone who's in their late 20s. This is why larger age gaps are often a problem in relationships. You're simply not in the same life stage and have different timelines."
"&gt;It feels so odd that she cares about being frugal and purchasing things on specials when shes throwing away so much more willingly.

Well, here is where you two differ quite a bit. She's not opening up a trash can and depositing her money, she's giving it to two family members who are very important to her, who she wants to have a good future. I really hope that you're not referring to it in this fashion when you're talking to her about it. 

Also, in terms of 'other things', rather than approaching it from the rather greedy perspective of 'she could be using these savings for ____ instead', why not ask her if the two of you can come up with a plan for how you can travel, save for your kids if you have them, etc. That is more productive and will come across much better than the rather 'but why isn't this money for *us*' attitude that you are somewhat projecting at the moment.

"To recap:

1) she has a hobby that she's really into - **great!**

2) you've asked to see her at these things/watch her dance and practice.  She's told you no several times - **ok, that's honestly kinda shady...**

3) the guys she's dancing with don't know you exist - **umm... that is also a pretty bad sign, especially with the above**

4) she's lied to you in the past about a guy.  She stays out until *4am* with *people who think she's single, whom she doesn't want you to meet* - **open your eyes, guy**."

If he cannot afford to contribute to rent, utilities and expenses, he's not ready to move out of his parents home."
"&gt;The fact that you're attracted to Stacy at all is interesting.

Why? She looks and acts like a woman.

I don't think I understand the question. I know she was born in the wrong body. She's always felt like a female despite having a masculine body, so she transitioned.

"It's inherent to some types of people. The understanding of empathy has evolved a bit, and it's currently held that there are different types of empathy. People on the spectrum tend to have trouble with one type of empathy, and that is inherent. Psychopaths have deficits in a different type of empathy. I don't what the current thinking is on people with psychopathic tendencies or personality disorders, whether there is some inherent tendency or if it develops completely from the outside. Psychopaths do exhibit different brain structures from non-psychopaths, but you can't tell from brain structure what is inherent and what is learned."

Everyone saying the fiancé needs to ask to build a relationship with her parents is wrong. Parents should only care that their children are happy and treated well. OP should talk to both her parents and her husband about this. They shouldn't have the expectation of the boyfriend and he shouldn't ask. OP isn't a cow. She's a human making an adult decision. Quite frankly she needs no ones blessing. People can and will offer their love, support, and excitement naturally.

Tell him to cut it out immediately. If he has something to say that isn't nice to you, he shouldn't say it, let alone think it. If he can't keep his insults to himself, I'd reevaluate if it's worth the pain of becoming a complete nervous wreck.

In other words, end it. "
"I upvoted your comment at first, then I went and read the actual threads.

Quite the contrast to this thread, where both parties are satisfied with their sex life, OP's wife explained that she's just not comfortable with that particular sex act, and the problem is entirely manufactured by OP's buddies."

She's not happy. It's hard on her. What do you do when your partner is having a bad time? You certainly don't apologize. You hold her, comfort her, try to make her time better. It's not different.

If she's accusing you for too long, well, I said it, it's not your fault in any way, shape or form. You've just learned that she will make the guy she's dating have prolonged hard times for no reason. Maybe don't be that guy."
"As far as roommate situations go, this doesn't sound that bad. The vent issue sucked, but it sounds like that has been most resolved. If it still bothers you, perhaps you can play some white noise or ask them to stay in the living room instead of her bedroom.

As far as having people over in general, you should have anticipated that when moving into a 5 person house. I'm surprised your house isn't a zoo with your various friends, boyfriends, and study partners. It doesn't sound like her boyfriend is around an awful amount. 

Ideally you guys would have drawn up boundaries for boyfriends when you moved in, but you can bring it up now if you want. It's going to come off as attacking her, however, and I'd save it until there's a bigger issue (her boyfriend is over when she isn't, her boyfriend is showering at your place, etc.)."

"Also, worth noting that ""job stress"" is basically a bare minimum relationship stressor in the grand scheme of things so if THAT'S all it took for her to jump into bed with a stranger after 8 years, it does not portend well for her ability to do so in the future.  It's selfish, it's calculated, and I can definitely see why her family is less than enthused.  It doesn't just reflect poorly on her, it reflects badly on them as well."
Did you tell your boyfriend about her and her problematic behaviour? 
"&gt;My boyfriend told me that he wasn’t gay and this was the only time. He said his friend came out to him and wanted to give him a blow job because he was moving to Europe permanently. He explained to me that he was never going to see his friend again and the least he could do was let him suck his penis.

Wow.

&gt;Ugh. I don’t know what to do. I know my boyfriend is genuinely sorry about what he’s done.

What do you mean by sorry? He's sorry that he got caught? He's sorry he didn't tell you he had very homoerotic fantasies? What is he ""sorry"" for exactly?

&gt;He’s been communicating a lot with me, and the recent sex we’ve had has been the best I’ve ever experienced.

Well, I'm about 100% sure my SO would not have sex with me in these circumstances. 

I have less of a problem with the sayonara blow job, and more with the fact that he's cheating, regardless of gender. Plus, if this was that much of a secret and a ""1 time thing"", then wouldnt they be a bit more careful about this? You being able to walk in on an active BJ seems careless on their part...which leads me to believe that he wasn't REALLY hiding it. People, if motivated, are very good about hiding things they dont want to get out. This could be a slight call for help. I mean, he is still 20 and is clearly grappling with his own sexuality and how to express himself. I doubt this is a super rare issue among 20 year olds these days. 

I think, generally speaking, guys dont really dabble in gay sex. There are definitely instances where guys try it out and dont ever do it again...but I'm willing to bet that most have a realization and go all in on their preferences. 

Talk to him and try to understand his sexuality. I think he's apologizing etc. in order to cover up any kind of shame he's feeling because of the moment. But I think you need to get to the bottom of this and try to understand it. Its clear he's struggling to figure things out. 
"
"&gt;Definitely co-dependant on some level, but in this example you give, in all honesty Lyft wasn't a thought (you writing that was a faceplam, but the instance Im thinking of when I napped in the car was about 2years ago and I dont know if I was an Uber/Lyfter then) and other times (most) I was the designated driver.

Even if you weren't, cabs and safe ride have been a thing since forever.  You're coming up with reasons to make yourself the martyr in situations where you are already upset so that you can further justify any anger behind future decisions."
"Yeah, it sounds to me that this is more a combination of the OP regularly pushing past her own comfort zone for her boyfriend's comfort (when her boyfriend doesn't do the same she gets mad) and them not doing romantic or fun things or go on adventures. OP, what would be legit would be to say ""This whole experience has made me realize that I'm not happy with our current rate of going out. It's not your fault what happened, and I apologize for taking it out on you. But it points to a larger issue in our relationship right now that I'd like to work through together."""
"I'm surprised this hasn't come up yet, but it sounds like your sister has munchausen's, not hypochondria.  Munchausen's is when you fake being sick for attention.  Hypochondria is when you actually believe you are ill."
You pick fights about nothing and you went through his phone looking for something to pick a fight about. Now you want him to constantly reassure you that he's not cheating and you interrogate him about who he's with. You've got issues.
"If I had been told someone in my employ had stocked regulars and yelled at them over a tip, I would fire the person on the spot. That behavior is bad for business, and a definite liability. I agree with you completely. OP needs to tell the owner. "
"OP, if for no other reason than if you die, she HAS to go to basic finance classes. Do you have kids? Who will care for them financially if something happens to you? Because she can not."
"Holy fucking shit, you've got a narc. He's a goddamn ed narcissist and you need to bail right now. Two months is nothing. Abort mission! GTFO! Also, stop telling your mom things you don't want repeated because she's proven that she can't be trusted with secrets. Trust is earned through respect and understanding, she's not entitled to it just cause she decided to have you. But seriously, run far away from that boy, cause his brain is broken."
Another agree on this one - I know someone who used this therapy and it helped her so so much. 
"I was married to a guy that gave me the diagnosis of ""disassociative identity disorder"" and I believed him. When we'd argue, he'd just say I was confused. When I was upset about anything, it was just the DID. The police weren't going to help me when he abused me, because they will see I am crazy, and take me to jail.

I'm not saying this will happen, but saying you need to be treated for NPD with no formal diagnosis is a very bad sign. You don't sound like you have the disorder.

Please don't let anyone convince you that you are crazy. Leave the diagnosis to the pros. And get rid of this guy. Your achievements are worth something.  "
"If the prof was being accused of sexual harassment by 3 male students then showed up with female students who said she had *never* mentioned anything inappropriate to **them** it wouldn't make sense. 

Same point applies here. "
Reddit is supposed to be anonymous.  She was not trying to hook up with people.  Just expressing a fantasy.
"This has nothing to do with your parents. It's about when _you_ have the resources to care for a pet, and when you understand your future plans enough to know you will continue being able to care for it. It doesn't sound like you're in that situation right now and so it would make you a poor pet owner to adopt right now. Once you are in a situation where it would be a responsible decision, go for it, regardless of what your parents say. "
"The person who finds a way to remove stretchmarks will be very wealthy indeed. 

OP - her weight issues aside there’s nothing she (or any other woman on this planet) can do about her stretchmarks. Regarding your relationship, it would be kinder to break up but do not tell her why. Just say you’re incompatible or something. She’s already unhappy and you stringing her along will make her feel so much worse. "
"Surprisingly, most people would assume this to be the case. Then you have that other guy. 

Don't be that other guy. "
WTF is up with these posts regarding 30 year olds dating people that can't even legally drink? You are 2 years separated from high school and this dude has crossed over into his 30s. This guy is waving a larger red flag than the Soviet Union could ever produce enough fabric to construct.
"I get the agreed division of labor, but when you are too sick to even get out of bed to do the cleaning, he is being petty and childish by leaving it all to accumulate until you got well enough to do it because ""it's not his job"".  
Also, the hanging out on the couch and fussing at you to finish your work so he could play makes it look like he doesn't really or see you as an equal. If he did, he would have made an effort to help during the time when you were *actually unable* to do what needed to be done.  
  
As to the current situation, just go for a walk, get some coffee or something. When you get back, try having a calm talk about what happened and why."
"She values her sisters differently than you do, she sees them as her responsibility and saving up money to send to them is important.

This type of conflict ends up on this sub regularly enough. One partner has different values about supporting or giving money to their biological family, while the other doesn't see the point or doesn't like it. This is such a deep value that neither of you are going to change, so if it's a point of argument, you guys are incompatible. You can either accept that she will spend money on her sisters probably for her whole life, or you can leave and find someone whose values about spending money on family are more similar to your own."
"that made me pause as well - things AREN'T going to change in the near future. But it seems like magical thinking on her part at this point, considering none of his actions OR his words have indicated that things are going to change soon. "
"That stuff is so visible though. I would know if he was doing all those activities because, like, we live together, and we would probably do at least some of them together. He might do an activity like that once a month at the most? But not often."
"This!  Totally sexist, my blood was boiling reading this.  The issue is legitimate, the disrespectful way he treats her and her career (*just quit* as if her jobs not real or something)?  Totally unacceptable. "
"Yep. Def reach out to the fiancé, tell her you're sorry and embarrassed and that you'll stay away from her man from now on.. then do that."
"If I were white and is the majority, it would be easy for me to say ""I would rise aboooovvveeee and forget about them"". if I were black and had a lifetime of experiences of people treating me as a lesser I would not be able to rise above.

Maybe its because Im Asian and we arent treated as badly in stores as black people but not as welcomes as white people that I see both sides. In the end, its not your bf's job to stop you from reacting. Its his job to support you even if hes not the type that claps back."
LOL you nailed it. This 100%
"Yes!  It's fair that op was not perfectly explicit, but he is also leaving things extremely vague, and I would bet that was totally intentional!  Since he never asked her out or called it a date, she never had the chance to reject him.  Before the date she would have been *presumptuous* to say she's not romantically interested.  He's ""just being nice, can't I give you a compliment??""  And now she's already accepted the date and the gifts so she *owes* him!  If he wanted to change their relationship from friends to dating, he had to give her a chance to say no."

"&gt;I've always been led to believe it's in bad taste to gift someone you've never met.

""Led to believe"" by whom? That's just not the common-sense etiquette rule you want everyone to believe it is.

"She’ll learn the hard way that guys his age who date teenagers have issues. Chances are she’ll come out of it sadder but wiser.

That doesn’t mean you’re required to lie to your parents for her. If she’s grown up enough to date a 31 year old, she’s grown up enough to do it in the open. You don’t have to go out of your way to tell them, and if you’re feeling generous you can redirect any questions they ask you with an “You’ll have to ask [sister],” but let her know that you will not be lying for her anymore. 

The best thing you can do for her is keep the lines of communication open. Don’t let her take on an “us against the world” mentality with this guy. Keep hanging out with her, don’t shit-talk him, and be polite (not warm, just courteous) when you see him. You want her to feel like she can come to you if the relationship sours in any way. 

It’s a thin tightrope to walk, but try. You’ll be glad you did. "
"I'm not going to lie to you, needing to be carried out of the house for your hand being smashed sounds really overdramatic."
"Sit down at the table. Say some variant of ""I am concerned about our relationship. We agreed to share chores now that I am working, but you refuse to do them regularly. Yes, I find it aggravating that I have to act like mommy to tell you to do chores, but the real issue is that the idea of being married to someone who refuses to help around the house is as big a turn-off as I can imagine. It is the most unsexy thing imaginable to me, I find myself repulsed at the idea of being married to someone who refuses to grow up, and if this is who you really are, I am worried about the future of our relationship. I don't know what to do at this point, so since this is all due to you, I'd like you to tell me how we solve this problem. Because it is a problem. It is a filthy, flies in our sink problem because my husband refuses to adult. So how do we fix this?"""
"Your feelings are very understandable.  I think it would be a good idea to resume therapy and help you sort this out so you can be there for your girlfriend.  There are also support groups for lovedones of cancer patients.

"Him attempting suicide like that in front of you was abusive. It sounds like he may be mentally ill, but that isn't an excuse. There is no excuse for being an abuser.

His mental health isn't your responsibility, anyway. You need to look out for yourself right now.

Personally, I would not spend any time around him in case he is tempted to hurt himself again or it escalates into him hurting you. If he makes any threats about doing either, even if you're not sure he's serious, call the police. It's better to be safe than sorry.

You may be able to get out of your lease if you contact your landlord and explain the situation to them. You could also speak to a local tenants' association to see what options you have regarding stuff like subletting.

Also, witnessing something like that can be really traumatising, so please consider speaking to a therapist about it if you need to."
"You caught your girlfriend on a date with your brother,  why are you second guessing yourself? "

&gt; Use that time to mature a little

Isn't that exactly what OP wanted? He knew he wasn't ready to get engaged at his age and it's surprising his GF didn't see that before proposing. "
"You're completely right.  I should have just told her from the get go and I even had multiple opportunities to, but I just couldn't and didn't.  

I involve her in all the ups and downs of my life.  When I got my promotion, she was the first one I told.  When I'm getting stressed out because of work, she's the one I reach for.  When I needed a new battery in my car, I told her about it first.  When I got an award at work for something I did, she was the one I showed a picture of the award.  Hell, when I'm taking a shit, I even text her to tell her that.  I am madly in love with this girl and want to include her in every aspect of my life. 

The only reason I didn't say anything about the money was because I didn't want to come off as bragging or not being humble about it.  It was pure overthinking that got the best of me and it won.  "

" Reporting a sibling out of spite would be an enormous overreaction to a conversation about privilege. The fact that they assumed you followed through with it makes me wonder about how you treat your sister in general.

"I agree with the fact that you should never badmouth your company or manager, but I wouldn't say that it was a hostile work environment, because that's badmouthing your company/ manager.  When you're asked why you left, always make it about you, never about them.

And I'm not even gay, which just makes your comments feel even more ridiculous. I don't know why, but I can tell you for certain that I've never had sex or done anything remotely intimate with George. You can think whatever you want about my sexuality; I honestly don't care. I don't know why, but I'm telling you for certain that George is lying, and this is the last time I'm going to address this here.""

"They can choose to not be friends with these guys if they want to. Without knowing what they chat about, it's hard to determine if they're over reacting.

"Good news - in Washington state she can get an abortion without parental consent. 

Talk to Planned Parenthood and ask about the cost of their services and whether some sort of payment plan is available for someone in her situation. You may also want to ask for info in a local subreddit like /r/Seattle.

If she agrees, you can help by making inquiries for her and helping her book the appointment."
"Ya, my vote here is on moving away, since the sister likely can't follow due to custody. It's also a lot easier to say no when not in person and on the spot."
"&gt;How do you feel about this line of reasoning?

It's not great. 

If I am a person who needs affection in a relationship, that will help determine my choice of partner. If I am getting a level of affection that I need from someone I am dating, that will help me to continue dating them. If they are unaffectionate, and we discuss it with me saying I would liek more, and they say ""this is just how I am"" I would **not** adjust myself to not need affection. I would end the relationship.

For me personally, I need someone to laugh with. It is very near the top of my list. It is not something I tried to smoosh out of myself so I could continue to be with various people I was dating. Instead, I used it to as a criteria to continue dating them.

Your view on needs in a relationship is overly masochistic and really comes at things from the wrong end.

You really propose turning yourself into a bonsai person (small, clipped, crabbed) to be in a relationship, when your therapist is trying to get at the opposite - how could you thrive and be the biggest tree with someone else?"
Thanks I was thinking it was some kind of drug or something
"So if everyone is in agreement... what are you worrying about here? Genuine question? Let them be, you’ve said what you needed to and it’s all very valid. But your brothers gonna do what he wants because this is clearly a pattern.

As long as everyone just helps when baby is here (in the normal way, not by paying for stuff or picking up slack because they can’t because of the weight problems etc) then just leave it now. You can’t force them to adult. They’ll have to learn the hard way "
So sex before marriage is A-Okay but no to holidays? It sounds like he’s not as into this relationship as you are. There is nothing weird or outrageous about you wanting to spend holidays with him especially when you’re alone AND he’s taking a New Years trip with FRIENDS. You’re the FIANCÉ.

Nah. I'm with OP. You can't teach a three year old to be strong enough to survive ocean currents. You can't teach a three year old to not become unconscious from hitting their head or something. You were being unreasonable hostile to the idea of proactively protecting a child from ending up in a dangerous situation. And got real judgey about OP's parenting decisions (that turned out to not even be true). 
Wait. Is the kid his ?! Oo
"Yeah, agree 100%. I would be pretty devastated if my partner wasn't sexually compatible with me after waiting years and adding marriage on top of that."
"&gt; He chose to spend his life with you, so why is he prioritizing his friend here?

That may very well be why; OP may be graduating, but they have an entire life's worth of accomplishments to celebrate together in the future. They've also celebrated many past accomplishments together, including probably another one or two of OP's graduations."
Nah dude. You were his backup plan. Don't be someone's back up plan. He lost his chance and you should just move on from this guy.

"I see your edit.

I still think that you are in the wrong here.

If you can trust him, then you can trust him, and your cop-out statement elsewhere in the thread about ""not trusting the other girls"" is simply that: a cop-out to rationalize the fact that you really  *don't* trust him.  If he's a stand-up guy and has committed to you, then every girl in every bar, restaurant, club, shoe store, and movie theater in your city could throw themselves at him, and it wouldn't make any difference.

And if he's *not* a stand-up guy, then this party isn't going to be his first, last, or only chance to cheat.

So either you have nothing to worry about from him, in which case you have nothing to worry about from the party, or you have something to worry about from him, so the party itself is irrelevant.

Rationalize all you want with phrases like ""out of respect for the relatinship"", but what you're ultimately saying is that unless you're watching, you don't trust him."
"&gt; I don’t want to stand over his shoulder like a teacher making sure he does an assignment

Maybe that's what it will take.

That would just make OP look like a homophobic gaybasher. :(
"You're 23, so as weird as it feels, you've left the age where you actually need your parents approval. Maybe your dad will flip shit and tell you what a horrible decision you've made - but even if that feels hurtful, it's okay. You're a grownup, and you get to make your own choices.

You know your dad better than we do. Try and think of the settings in which he is the most calm, receptive, and relaxed. Those are the contexts in which you should talk to him. Your mom, if she's supportive, may actually be able to give you advice on this front."
"Just leave. Whatever “good” qualities you think he has, however he’s managed to isolate and trap you into thinking that a relationship with someone who sexually assaults you on the regular is as good as it gets, none of it will matter once you get away. Talk to someone in your country that deals with abuse (because yes, he is abusive), make your plan and leave. Don’t tell him you’re breaking up, don’t tell him you’re leaving. He’s already sexually assaulting you, don’t give him the chance to escalate to “one for the road.” "
You want a future like this? With someone like this? 
Personally it sounds like you are a bit picky when it comes to looks which can be limiting. It sounds like you want the most attractive guys who typically don't struggle to date woman which may make them arrogant (there are all huge generalizations). The fact is my guess is that you feel you are too good for most guys and that is causing you to struggle to find that perfect one. I can't help you because my advice would be to maybe give others a chance and stop judging solely on looks.
"But regardless of her intentions, confronting her would only entangle OP in unnecessary drama with a person who seems experience in emotional manipulation and playing the victim. It’s a pointless fight, especially since OP’s boyfriend wasn’t falling for it and even was transparent with her about it. 

Just because that girls intentions was to gain emotional intimacy with all the men in her life, that doesn’t mean that it’s OP’s responsibility to rehabilitate her lack of stability. The only person who has to show loyalty and honesty to OP is OP’s boyfriend, not some random chick thirsty for validation. "

"No honestly your situation is different. You liked one then decides you like the other more, not you liked one they got a girlfriend so you decided to go for the other. "
"I know it hurts, but its for the best. His threat to ""restructure"" your relationship if he didn't get exactly what he wanted from you was kind of alarming to me. To me, that sounded like a shorter way of saying ""I am going to be emotionally unavailable and distant to make you insecure but also make you feel like you cannot move on so you get stuck in an agonizing limbo until I feel that I've punished you enough to ensure that you will always do what I want in the future"". That's a run on sentence but you see what I mean, hopefully. And that's manipulative and abusive behavior. 

In the end, it seems like he broke up with you because the outside input was going to break his normal tactics of making you malleable. This can be a whole new start for you! A chance for you to find a new healthy relationship and experience what it feels like to have a true, loving relationship. "
"As someone who is 6+maths pregnant right now, I can confirm that pregnancy is VERY taxing on the body. There’s aches and pains in places you didn’t even know existed! While I’m not overweight or obese by any means, I am in contact with ladies who were heavier when they fell pregnant and they still feel the same aches and pains as I do. Organs within your body, stretch and shift to make room for the baby, so it’s gonna hurt! Given SILs weight, she would be advised not to gain weight during pregnancy, but I have the feeling she’d be one of those people that would use it as an excuse to “eat for two”. "

"For the very reason that he refuses to take responsibility for his actions and find out if he's fathered a child, I would walk away, unless the other man adopts the child. This is a ticking time bomb that could go off in your life at any time and it's most likely to happen after you could not walk away, like when you're pregnant with your BFs child. The other thing is, I don't know that I'd be keen to make a baby with a man who doesn't want to know one way or the other if he's the father of a child. That's a red flag to me."

"I would straight up talk to him and be clear of your concern, don't dance around it, don't throw in a bunch but of other stuff.

1. His long lost love is back and his family seems to be welcoming her and incorporating her as is she was their daughter in law.

2. He is now hanging out with her daughter and being close to her.

3. Is there more contact with Amanda going on?

4. Is he going to redkindle a friendship with her?  What about a romance?

5. Is he going to stay true to you?

6. Has he thought about leaving you and going to her? "
He is skirting the conversation. He is going through 9 years of Amanda's SM 
"I'm sorry but at this point she is entering abusive territory. She locked you out in the cold, violated your privacy by reading your text messages, and also pinched you which is pretty much physical abuse. Also, I know you are viewing it from the perspective of you hurting her emotionally BUT from an outsider's perspective, you are being very reasonable and she is being incredibly emotionally abusive/manipulative.

Honestly, at this point, I'd say it's time to exit the relationship. Things aren't going to get better, not with things escalating the way they are."
"&gt;My parents refuse to hear anything bad about Ben and blame it on me not wanting to have kids. If you had a kid with him, this would not have happened.

"He was allegedly too hungover to respond to texts or call to the OP to let her know, but he had himself together to drive about an hour roundtrip."
OP gave the money on the condition that his mother use it for living expenses. She didn't give it to her boyfriend so he could buy himself toys.
I'm revenge fantasizing about OP and Grandma doing all sorts of awesome shit together and even going so far as having a social media dedicated to their awesome escapades. Like OP at the beach lifting grandma over her head and a bunch of hot oiled guys holding sushi and shit.

tbh you don't sound as if you've changed at all. You seem even more selfish than you did in your first post. I don't think you're being a good father. 1 week a month is not parenting. You just want to be there for the good times with your kids but leave the actual parenting for your wife. I feel sorry for her and I'm glad she got divorced because you are extremely narcissistic
"Yeah, my ex-wife also refused to see a counselor because she didn't feel it would help. Turns out she was having an affair with her boss and had no intention of staying. People who refuse to work on fixing a marriage have already checked out. If he was still on the fence he'd be trying to look at solutions with you. Sorry OP, what an awful situation you are in; but this guy's a douche and you need to be mentally prepared for the worst."
It really makes me question everything he's ever told me about his ex wife being a psychopath &amp; how she was so abusive to him. Chills. 
"Don't feel stupid. You were taken advantage of then and are being taken advantage of now. He has literally groomed you to be what he wants and now, years later, the novelty has worn off."
"&gt;Like how can I feel decent about myself but this person, my favorite life person ever I love so much, not see that? How? **I must be delusional or over estimating myself.**

OR, he's an abusive piece of shit and he WANTS you to feel like shit so he can do whatever he wants and you'll never leave him.

"&gt; I feel like it would be better for the cat to live somewhere she won't get kicked out from.

But you *are* kicking her out from her new home. The cat would much rather move to a new apartment with you than go back to the shelter, believe me.

Do what you gotta go, but don't kid yourself that you're being the good guy here. You took on responsibility for the care of a living, feeling creature in full knowledge of what your lease says, and now you want to dump it again for that reason. Plus, you say your landlord has been reasonable about pets (including cats) in the past, and that was your justification for getting the cat. What has changed? In any case, the landlord is highly unlikely to do more than tell you to get rid of her in the first instance, you won't be evicted because finding a good new tenant is a pain in the ass for the LL.

I repeat: Do what you gotta go, but don't kid yourself that you're being the good guy here."

It would be different if the old lady was rude, but actually needed OP. That would be tricky.  But it sounds like the old woman wants OP to mind her own business. "
Just check up on whether you're in a two or single party consent area.
"I don't know, he stopped talking to me in July when I wouldn't invite toxic brother and gf to my 20 wedding celebration.  "
"Of course there's no guarantees but it's a safer bet with a healthy baby and autism can be diagnosed by about 2. 

Parents lives matter. It's okay to not want to sink a ridiculous amount of time, money, energy, and happiness into caring for a special needs child. I'm glad siblings of special needs kids learned something from it. I'm not saying it's a completely negative experience just that for parents it can be more than anyone wants to deal with. "
"lol, what have they done to attempt to get to know him becasue it goes both ways. Do they ask about him? Did they attend the wedding? It takes really low effort to simply post a joke or a cute video on facebook. Your mother sounds bratty."
"Dude you're almost 30, haven't even begun to think about your future romantic goals, think moving in together after 8 years is rushing it, and apparently can't envision the relationship moving beyond what amounts to casual dating. It sucks that your girlfriend waited so long to start talking about this stuff because this is not going to turn out well for her. "
"Move on from both. Your boyfriend is unwilling to communicate with you at all and IMO, he's been swindling you out of $500/month for an unusable place to live. At this point, you need to make it clear to your bf that he needs to figure out a legit timeline to renovate this place or you're moving on from both. How long are you gonna be able to wait for this guy to fix this place up before you end up resenting him for stringing you along? How are your feelings about this so unimportant to him? Is your bf really as great as you make him out to be if he doesn't care about your feelings here at all?"
"Yeah, boyfriend's arguments make no sense. In the initial conversation, he made no mention of being at out with some of his asshole friends and he'd found his phone in their pocket or anything. Only thing he could come up with was, ""I lost track of my phone for a bit and you calling me helped me find it."" Where does he say that he was when this happened, I wonder?"
"Side note for future reference, if someone who is driving you somewhere says anything remotely on the lines of them being ready and they head to the car, that means they want to leave ASAP. It does not mean you have a few minutes and they are happily waiting for you in the car. No one likes waiting in the car. Yeah he could communicate better and you do not deserve his reaction at all, but doddling in the morning when he is waiting in the car is disrespecting his time. "
"There is nothing wrong with her behavior at all. Saying ""Hello"" yo someone is a completely normal and socially acceptable thing to do. You know who does need a talking to about their behavior? The assholes that are cursing out your girlfriend. I've lived all over the East coast and never had someone cuss me out for saying hello or giving them a freakin compliment. Just because you are from NYC doesn't mean you have any right to be an asshole. Some people are too full of themselves."
You have an uncommonly puritanical view of these things.  I've known plenty of gay men who have similar conversations and it certainly isn't because they disrespect their own gender.
"I think this is the crux of it for him. He wouldn’t touch the money if it were invested, but my dad very emphatically doesn’t want it to be invested at all and wants it to stay in a savings account. I don’t agree with my dad, but I respect his wishes because it’s his gift."
Your husband sounds awesome. That was such a sweet gesture. I’m guessing there’s some underlying jealousy there from some of your friends. Don’t think you did anything wrong. You didn’t. Some people get really stoic and quiet when they are hurt; some people cry. You can’t help how your body responds to that kind of pain. Your friends are being ridiculous. 
"I guess my friend who had have her face burned off when she was a kid will never find love then.

Oh wait, she did. And I guarantee you are better looking than her."
"The only thing you can do is not play their game. Don't go this year. Spend it with your wife and forget about your family.

Next Christmas you two will have a little one, a third person in your new family, so maybe talk about traditions you'd like to build together.

Congrats on the baby and give your family a special holiday ""fuck you"" from me!"
"I'm in my 30's and if that happened now, I would have no problem telling him that it's inappropriate. But at 24, I was kind of shy, just starting my career, and I would've been scared of being rude. It sounds stupid but there you go."
"It’s not necessarily that he was a predator. It’s just that usually, when a grown man who’s 27 wants to date a teenager, it suggests that he’s super immature (which he’s not confirmed with this bullshit). I’m sure you were a perfectly normal teenager, and when I sit at a restaurant next to a table of perfectly normal teenagers, I am so glad I don’t have to deal with them on a regular basis as a 26-year-old. Most normally-developed 27-year-olds cannot fathom why a person their age would want to date a teenager, and it usually boils down to that person having horrible relational skills or being really immature."
"There’s no medication for abusive and controlling behavior. Also, see how quickly she tells you later that the doctor wouldn’t give them to her, there was some bs with insurance, or she was told she doesn’t need them. It’s all manipulation (including the shower stuff), it’s escalating and you deserve better. "
"It's high time you proved her wrong. You've said elsewhere in the thread that if someone you knew was in your situation, you'd do whatever you could to get them the fuck out ASAP. You know this situation is fucked and that she's only going to get worse, time to act on that information"
"My brother was aweful to me growing up so I 100% relate to your sister. He has grown up alot but I never felt he truly understood or was remorseful for the damage he did to me. I could see him trying to make up for it so I tried too, but I just couldn't get passed it. I  removed him from my life about two years ago and I am so much more mentally stable and my relationship with my mother is even slowly improving. I never realized how much stress he caused me untill he was gone. I get you want to repair the damage but some things can't be forgotten. If you truly want to help her leave her be, let her put herself first. "
"First off, I am sorry for what you are going through. I know you feel helpless right now, but you aren’t. 

I would start with social services. You should be eligible for food stamps. You can also inquire about section 8 housing. There are also programs that help with employment training, my mom directs one that does that. 

If you have a brain injury, you need to get on Medicaid right away and apply for disability.  There are programs and services out there for you to use, please do. "
"Let's all just be blindly supportive of people making shit decisions because feelings and showing emotional support is wayyyy more important than reality. lol, ok."
"She definitely sounds like someone you need to do a lot of conversational work to keep in their lane and based in facts and not emotions, I feel for you. And now she is grieving, so there's a whole added layer of Difficult for you in navigating emotionally driven conversation. 

Try, do your best to TRY to communicate to her and get her to a more calm place, but do be loving about it. End the conversation if she gets angry or overly emotional and revisit it at another time. It may be one of those things that just becomes a permanent fixation for her though so be prepared for that.

I'm sorry for your family's loss. I hope everyone heals well together. Try not to let this get in the way of that process."
"An anecdote of an exception does not disprove a trend. 

I also didn't say his relationship is doomed. I said just don't feel rushed into a life long commitment when you are so young with someone much older. I'm also in a relationship with an age gap."
"So would it be cool to go to MIL and FIL's house, use the master bathroom, and comment about the fungus cream and the viagra? Or the brand of condoms they use? ""Omg, I didn't know you were allergic to latex!"" ""What do you mean."" ""Oh well I couldn't find the toliet paper and I checked in your dresser and I found sheepskin condoms!"" "
You've got a point. I wouldn't want to make things awkward for her. I know my family means a lot to her. If I were to make a move and she didn't like it I wouldn't want her to feel like she wasn't welcome anymore. At the same time I feel like we could be something great. I'm just not the best at reading women and I haven't a clue how to tell if she's into me or not... 
"&gt; I mean... am I missing something or is it not really “from an insecure person’s perspective” and more “an accurate assessment of what happened”.

I agree. Insecurity has nothing to do with it."
"It's tough. Overcoming stuff that you've been raised with is particularly tough, because there's no way you can know what you don't know. First you have to figure out there's stuff you don't know. Then you have to figure out what it is. Then you have to remake yourself into something healthy, when maybe you have very little idea of what healthy is or looks like."
"I would give it until she's in high school. You can wait until next September. It seems like forever now, but it is important to wait. She's still a little girl. You're solidly in your teens. That's a big difference now but it won't be in a year. "
"He might feel guilty, but guilt is a useless emotion unless it spurs you to action. His doesn't."
"Don't view it as tattling, and don't phrase it that way either (i.e, don't be all ""why is she mean to me?""). Instead come at it from a place of concern, because you want to have at least a cordial relationship with close family members. Ask your sister if you've done anything to upset SIL, or if there's anything you can do to get to know her better."
"I'm reading a lot of comments saying that she shouldn't ruin another's marriage, that it was not physical and a lot of shitty excuses, but if OP was the cheater, things would be different and everyone would be saying that the other part deserved to know and that she was the one that got herself in that situation. 

He cheated, emotionally, but cheated, and you found about it on accident, so I'd tell the other guy. "
"So let me get this straight. 

Everyone is stoked because mom buys her daughter who struggles to save $100 after a paycheck *groceries* while she buys her son a new desktop and enables both son's and father's gambling addiction, losing *thousands*?

Fair enough! "
"Good for you, I'm glad your friends are all level-headed people who understand your POV :) "
"Seriously. Ugh, I can't imagine how uncomfortable this is for you. If it weren't for the dog who needs to be cared for, I'd say get out! "
"&gt; I mean you should have a healthy boundary.

Property lines are a healthy boundary."
"I second this. It's kind of heartbreaking that women can feel so pressured to be the ""cool gf"" that they begin to doubt their right to ask questions and demand answers when their partners are being shady. Hope OP finds a way to get to the bottom of this situation swiftly. "
I would be incredibly pissed too. She’s opening herself up to all kinds of risks by doing that for a stupid game. Honestly this would make me seriously question her judgment if I was in your position. 
"Agreed. It’s so horrible and sad what happened. This was an accident. You did not do it on purpose. This was not your fault. It was a horrible accident, but it was an accident. "
"I have the same problem with my boyfriend's family, except they love cycling. They are ALWAYS talking about their community, new bikes, racing, famous cyclists, etc. Honestly, it was terrible in the beginning. I had to no idea what anybody was saying, they would take me to races and hardly interact with me, it's was kinda shit.

I just told him and them that I totally respect their passion for the subject and think it's really awesome that they have something they bond over, but that I'm not that into the subject. Once in a while I'll come to a race if it's especially interesting, or I'll watch the Tour with them or play Fantasy League, but a lot of the time I do something I prefer instead or just zone out or a read a book when they talk about cycling stuff. I think it's hard for them because they can't relate to me, but it's really too much to expect to only connect with people who happen to be obsessed with the same hobby as you are and I think they understand that. I did tell my boyfriend that if it's a deal breaker, then he needs to break up with me. Instead he realized that there's more to life than cycling and that other stuff is interesting as well. He still loves it of course, and I'm happy for him and support him, but there's a mutual understanding that it's just not my thing, at least not right now. 

You can't change them, and you shouldn't try, I think it would be very inappropriate. However, you can make it clear to your boyfriend that although you like Disney, you don't LOVE it and it will never be the center of your life, and that maybe you would like to talk or do other things as well. Maybe try and share other things with him and your family that you like as well. 

As for (Christmas) presents you don't want, I have to say that is something everyone struggles with. I just ask for socks, and learn to suck it up if I get anything else I don't like. "
"You don't have to tell them you use Uber. You know that, right?

You need to stop telling them a lot of things. They are not normal, and unfortunately that means you can't have a normal relationship with them. "
"My sister did this for her wedding, because she wanted the photographs to turn out nice. She paid for the make-up artist because she wanted it, and we had a natural look that would photograph well."
"Yeah, then those people should get the fuck over themselves. Seriously dude, this post and comments are a reflection of your character and it's not pretty."
You made a mistake having sex with her again and you should go no contact with your ex so you can start moving on. 
"I’m trying to say this gently, but OP was aware of dad’s health issues. It’s not like OP didn’t know he had cancer, he was there helping with caregiving "

"They shouldn't. 
Your spunk goes bad. 
And also it's very sad for the kids that dad can't play with them anymore because he's just old and then he dies while his youngest is in hs. 

Yeah you have more money when you're older but trade off isn't worth it. 40 is a little old for a first kid. "
"So the question is, what do you plan to do now? Its clear he does not want or plan to change his actions. It is now on you, to determine what actions you want to take. Personally, I would absolutely call off the engagement and consider dumping altogether. "
I would want my dogs too. I'd take the dogs and go stay at your parents house or a friend that lives close by.
"&gt; Depending on her state, this may not be legal.

I sincerely doubt that someone like OP's sister would both know that and be willing to call the police over it. It's not my risk to take, obviously, but if I were in OP's shoes I'd do it tbh. "
"I will, I made my decision that I will do it soon, maybe next month because of holidays. But I'll book my appointment now.

And I'm sorry for the loss of your precious little lion. My baby was 13 when she passed, but I didn't spend as much time with her because of college and being a 20 year old. But since this past summer, a lot changed and I spent a lot of time with her. Your handsome dog is still here, kicking ass. Have one day a week or every month doing anything he wants. A day at the park, mix his dog food with human food, give him endless belly rubs, anything and everything! He already knows you love him. He will always be a part of you. Make more memories and take lots of pictures with him. He will always love you. As you love him."
Ps I think you should go for it! Life's too short and she sounds like a keeper and you're totally in love
"The point is that they had clear rules, and he violated them. If he thought the rules were unfair, the time to sort that out was before he ate out the other girl. "
"My dad was just made aware about ten minutes ago and he said that him and I need to get home early and have a talk tomorrow at 4pm, when my boyfriend is at work. Hopefully a plan of action. "
"Violent behaviors **can** be part of mental illness, let's stress the **can**. However, again, you are using mental illness as excuse to be violent and down play what you have done. You're not in a good mental state of mind and your husband has the right to have a safe, abusive free space. To be safe from YOU and your anger. Feel free to label it as mental health issues, either way- he needs a safe space because you do not provide one.

Mental health does not give you a free pass on being an abuser when you clearly are being one. Stop trying to spin it! You're still not fully accepting your negative actions."
"Your potential pool is obviously going to be very compromised. I don't think you won't find someone, but I also don't necessarily think having this incontrovertible criteria is setting you up to find someone you are a great match with. You're likely going to have to hitch your wagon to one of the first virgin Catholics that come by. 

What happened to your college girlfriend?"
This is probably exactly why he doesn’t like them.
"This, OP. He's setting you up for a lifetime of him always being right, and you always being wrong, in which you will constantly have to work to prove that you aren't behaving ""narcissistically"" (which will probably coincide with having to always do things his way). I do hope that you have the strength to saddle up the Nopetopus and ride right on out of this situation."
"If it's few and far between, having a drink or two isn't bad. It is when it becomes a habit that it becomes unhealthy. I've had my fair share of stressful days at work and I have a glass of wine or a shot or whatever. However, I could count on 1 hand how many times I've done that in the past 6 months."
"&gt; I consider myself an open-minded dude but ehhhh....

Yeah, you aren't. "
"Never anything wrong with asking what they're looking for. In face i've always assumed that's a pretty basic and normal question, especially stemming from a date that began on Tinder. Good luck OP!"
"I could have been with someone for 10 years and have kids, and the bill could have been $1000 for 5 strippers, and I'd still want out of te relationship. I would forgive and we'd manage to parent the kids together. Because its the smaller, corroborating lies in which everyone was involved that make me ill, and unable to trust. "
"Accept her as she is or move on.

"&gt;One of them had a sister with severe autism (doesn't know her name, non verbal, will never be able to go past being a toddler) and they told me that I had no heart. 

In other words, she was not the parent and never had to be in your position.

I have a child with autism. This is a HARD LIFE. I recognize that there are people out there who are able and willing to adopt a child with special needs. 

You should never feel ashamed for not being able to take this on. Any parent of a child with a disability should be able to understand that. The worst ones are those who have never had to walk in our shoes."
I do think this is the best answer here. It is a dreadful situation but therapy might help you guys get through this.
Maybe George told people that OP is ready to come out. I don't think the friends are entirely to blame but I do think it's fine for a gay person to want to remain in the closet. Someone accusing a possible gay person for being homophobic is ridiculous 
"I posted this as a comment to another reply, but I want to also post it as a main level comment to ensure that OP sees it.

As a gay man, I can tell you that calling out the hypocrisy of these folks will work in terms of helping get through to them.

""I'm disappointed at the comments that I've received to my prior post here. Those of you who are trying to shame me for standing up against being ""outed"" against my will are missing the point. They should recognize what a violation it is to try and forcibly out a gay man against his wishes. If I am gay, I'm clearly one who isn't comfortable with being out. That's a completely valid choice for a gay person to make. While I do not understand why, I can say for certain that George is lying about having slept with me. This is the last time I'm going to address things here.""

That would make an impression on people. If it doesn't, well...they aren't particularly good friends to have.

Edit: For the record, I'm absolutely suggesting you not claim your orientation. That's completely beside the point. Just call them out for their bad behavior and then deny having slept with George. Nothing else."
"If you are a guest, you have no right to make demands on the residents to accommodate you. I have a phobia of orcas. I don’t go to sea world and demand they hide the orcas. 

You can ask for reasonable accommodations. Please don’t let the dog jump at me - reasonable. Please make sure I don’t set eyes on the dog - not reasonable.

&gt;So if my fiancé lives with someone who has a dog I'm supposed to just never see him if I'm not financially stable enough to afford a hotel?

Correct. Your fiancé made the choice to live with a dog.

No one is denying that. It doesn’t mean he’s entitled to make demands on the residents. "
"Are you done whining like a simpering weakling?

You are not respecting your GF's agency. She is an adult who is more than capable of making her own choices. Guess what, she chose you.

So get out of your own fucking way, stop pitying yourself, and live up to the man she sees.

I guarantee that every problem you perceive is one you can solve if you just apply yourself, one small step at a time. As for your GF. If she wants to be with you, let her. Warning though. If you keep on doubting that she should be with you, she will start doubting it too. That is why you will lose her, not because you don't deserve her, but because you believe you don't deserve her.

You can be just as amazing as she is. You two came from the same place, now step up the way she did and join her in this new place. Stop making excuses. Do not be satisfied with who you are now. Choose to be better."

"This is absolutely correct. I’m Vietnamese. Born in VN and was raised in the US since I was four. Grew up with a ton of asian friends from multiple different ethnicity. It’s control plain and simple. Fuck their standards. As a guy I was either “too fat” “too short” or “too stupid.” 

Taller than them wasn’t good enough, all A’s in school wasn’t ever good enough cause it wasn’t A+, got a six pack one year and it wasn’t good enough. Did MMA and martial arts and it wasn’t good enough cause it wasn’t a classy sport in their eyes. The damn list goes on. 

As soon as I learned to ignore it, I was fine. People always gonna hate, even if they love you. Just because people love you don’t mean they understand you and people who understand you don’t mean they love you. Asian parents always mean well but their execution is far from perfect."

Also, your mental health isn't going to magically get better if you're not doing anything about it. Are you in therapy? Are you learning ways to manage your mental health? Taking a break from life is a luxury you can afford right now, but how will you afford it in 5-10 years when there's bills to pay and a relationship to maintain? I get that you're struggling wit your mental health, but sitting around in self-pity isn't gonna help you get better either."

"Honestly, it sounds like if you change universities you could turn your life around. You might be able to be happy again pretty quickly. Since you were proven innocent, those accusations won't follow you around anywhere. Sure, it wouldn't be your first choice of university, but who cares? You'll still be able to get a quality education, you'll be able to make a new group of wonderful friends who care about you deeply, and you can leave all this crap behind you. Try to change your feelings about that option, because I think it could be wonderful. Who knows, you might even end up liking a new university way better. There's no way to tell unless you try, especially since you're unwilling to go back to your old university.

"If you want to do things with your sister, you call her and make time to spend with her without the rest of the family. So far, you've let mom make the decisions and she's also alienated Natalie from you, not just your father.

The way you described the situation, it really sounds like your mom has pushed her away from the beginning. Your mother was the adult, your mother was the one who chose to be with a guy who already had a kid. It sounds like she didn't take care of that child at all and neither did your dad. That does cause shithead behaviour, so Natalie probably gave as much back as she received. 

Make a plan when Natalie has time to host you, if she wants that. You'll have to start over, without influence of your mom. If you don't take that step, Natalie won't. She's given up. After all these years of passiveness from the others, your mom has clearly won the war of affection. "
"Guys like this are DANGEROUS.

First--tell all your friends. Seriously.  Tell your family.  Give his picture to the security guards at your apartment complex, if you have any. Tell them that he's behaving in a creepy way and refusing to hear ""no.""

Block him on Messenger, and on every other social network.  If you feel like it's safe, send one single final message demanding that he no longer talk to you, and informing him that if he comes to your house you will call the police.

(Regardless of whether or not you send that message? If he shows up again, don't come to the door, and consider calling the  police.)

Lock down your FB. No more public posts, and don't talk about where you're going on it, only about where you've been (no more ""Can't wait to get sushi at Ben Gui tonight!"" but ""Really enjoyed sushi for dinner"" is okay; don't talk at all about places you go on a regular schedule).

Start making safecalls.  Make sure there's someone who knows where you're going, and when you're expected to be there.  Set up a safe word, so that you can say ""Wow, I have such a migraine!"" and the person on the other end knows that you mean ""call the fucking cops.""

Start getting someone to walk you to your car, if you park at work.

&gt;I tried to explain that I wasn't interested in a relationship with him

No more explanations.  No  more communication.  Cut him off. ANYTHING YOU SAY will only be taken as fuel.

Most suicidal people are not a danger to others. However, people who threaten suicide in an attempt to control someone frequently are.

Did you write her back?  I would honestly consider messaging her saying that a)you're concerned that her son is suffering some sort of mental break, because he's inventing interactions with you that never occurred, that b)you were his friend but you are no longer interested in any contact with him whatsoever because of how upsetting his behavior has been, and c)any further contact from him or any of his family will be taken as harassment and proceeded with as such."

"Please don’t take this the wrong way but you have only known each other since February. To know someone inside out and really understand how they think/ work may take longer. Also people are never who they say they are in the initial stages of a relationship they portray their ‘best self’. Can you say 100% that you know he isn’t meeting anyone else? If not you need to move on. If you’re having doubts now if you choose to move forward with him those doubts will keep growing and living with not trusting someone (justifiably) isn’t a way to live. 

I also don’t understand what exactly he is masturbating over. As far as I’ve seen Tinder isn’t exactly naked central so just masturbating over people’s normal photos be could use fb or IG for that. I think his behaviour is completely unacceptable. For me it would be a deal breaker. It’s disrespectful to you. "
"Yes, you do. You're stronger than you realize. There's a life out there for you without him, a life where you can respect yourself and not have to worry about what the hell he could be up to."
The fact that someone else paid for it all makes it even more ridiculous for OP to act that way.
Pretty sure sure meant that she won't see him again.

I tend to bounce from job to job, career field to career field....I never feel like I fit in. I'm always a misfit. I'm never one of those people that everyone really likes. Mistakes that others make and get laughed off tend to get raised eyebrows and gossip when I make them. Whatever the secret code to human interaction is, I wasn't born with it hard-wired into me. 

That, and I also have a hard time understanding complicated verbal instructions, I have a hard time visualizing the most logical steps to get from A to B, and I have a hard time processing new information and prioritizing multiple tasks to figure out which ones I should do in which order. 

All of these are hallmarks of ADHD and a therapist will not help him. Therapy cannot solve this. 

What your husband needs is a **PhD in Clinical Psychology** who is working at a **behavioral health practice**. He can call and specifically ask for an evaluation for ADHD and they will tell him if they can do it or not. He doesn't need to lay on a couch and talk about his childhood. He needs a licensed professional to give him a medical evaluation to rule out specific diagnoses. 

They will ask some background questions that will help characterize the issue: how was his performance in school as a child, did he have any majorly traumatic events (PTSD can cause weird issues), etc...but it's not to discuss his feelings. It's for clinical purposes to build a medical profile so they can hone in on underlying issues. 

I was given a standard assessment that evaluated things like working memory, auditory comprehension, things like that. It was actually really fun! It took several hours across 2 days. I filled out some questionnaires and so did my husband and parents. 

The important thing about being diagnosed is understanding himself more. You can't therapize ADHD away. If you have it, that is your neurotype. No amount of training or planning or scheduling or therapy will make it go away. It's a neurological disorder for which there is no cure. 

Fortunately, most of us who have it come up with coping skills to work around it and hide our symptoms. 

For example, when I don't understand what someone is asking me to do, I have ways I ask them to repeat themselves without actually telling them I don't fucking understand. Or, I repeat the instructions back to them to make sure I understood them right. I pretend I'm doing this to be collaborative but really it's because I have a disorder of my executive functions which means my problem solving and auditory comprehension are compromised. 

We find clever ways to mask our symptoms so the world doesn't think we are idiots. Beyond that, though, understanding yourself means you can develop coping skills at work that prevent you from being set up for failure. If I know for a fact that I struggle with A, B, and C, my little alarm bells will be ringing when B comes up on my desk. And I can start strategizing right away about how to accomplish B because I know my limitations! 

You've GOT to know your limitations. Over-scheduling, under-planning, and not having coping strategies will lead to failure. If you're convinced that you failed because you're stupid, you will be determined to commit to it all over again next time to prove you can! No, you're not stupid--your brain just doesn't work that way. So, work the problem. 

He needs help managing his symptoms and figuring out how to conduct himself in the adult world with his condition if he has ADD. There are so many of us out there--bumbling through life by the skin of our teeth, but willing to help and provide support. 

Get him the eval!"
It’s crazy to me that anybody thinks “never talk to the ex” is a reasonable response to this situation. All of the healthy people I know are on friendly enough (if occasionally awkward) terms with their exes. I actually consider it a potential red flag if someone can’t even have a polite conversation with their exes. 
"&gt;I have talked to her about it twice and offered to pay for everything and pay for her and the kids until she finds someone new

it doesn't work like this, **YOUR CHILDREN ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNTIL THEY'RE 18**

If you're both unhappy get a divorce, I would still seek help for your porn addiction however."
"Yeah and she chose the other guy over you. And you want to make the bonheaded decision to move yourself and your son into an unknown area away from any support you may have for some idiot who covers her tracks, lies to your face, and is fucking this other guy still. 

If you think she's not than you're being incredibly ignorant. She ditched visiting you to go on a weekend camping trip. She saves pictures of him, and she shifts blame onto you so you don't push further. Not only is she cheating she's blaming you for doing it and calling you controlling. Fuck her. 

Get a lawyer, get a divorce, and move on with your life. She is absolutely not worth it. Especially since you're doing all the work to try to fix things. 

This whole ""process to move"" line is bullshit, she should have moved back and cut the other guy off, not go on dates and camping trips with this guy. Oh and getting better phone features to prevent you from seeing what she's saying. 

You're 37, you know better. "
"Well.......keep that option open in the back of your mind just in case. 

Unless he’s just feeling sad that this could have been his child had he stayed with, or unless he’s just now realizing maybe he might want kids, I can’t see any innocent reason for his behavior. "
"The fact that she fixed it will now be the new thing she'll get made fun of. It will confirm she knows they are right, and that she is insecure about it. It will also be turned against her in the form of ""plastic bitch"". High schoolers are vicious. I still remember  everyone whispering and making fun of girls for any body modification. Plastic surgery is still looked down on, same as visibly photoshopping your Facebook pictures. 

OP, have you told your daughter this?"
That speaks of a huge lack of respect from him of other people and their right to make their own decisions.
"He didn’t even do anything that showed he was drunk or out of line... and you’re saying he is basically an alcoholic and shouldn’t be allowed to drink? Lol, the boss said something not okay and he in turn got defensive. This has nothing to do with him drinking... it’s not like he stood on the table and yelled or made a loud announcement to everyone. Don’t make this about his drinking"
"Can you try rephrasing it from ""can you leave"" to ""I need to be alone to concentrate on my homework""?  Alternatively, can you do your homework at the library? Or in your room and jam or lock the door?

And she just watches you and occasionally remarks how handsome you are? Are there other things she does that seem odd or uncomfortable?"
"It may come from a place of selfishness, or self-first-ness (not always the same thing), but I still think it is an honorable choice to realize that one cannot emotionally provide for a special needs child. A caretaker who resents or blames the child (and eventual adult, let's not forget they grow up) for their condition will not be able to provide that child with the loving care they need. Much better to acknowledge one's limitations with wide-open eyes, and put both self AND the child's needs first."
"&gt;""is that really her stuff?"" ""Yes."" ""look he's burning her good pjs"".

Yea, so they basically proved it for you that the stuff they were burning is yours."
Yes this. The police should go with you to get the rest of your things from his place. File that report and get them to escort you. 
He got off pretty easily because he was a minor. Would have been a felony otherwise.
"Yeah, OP's Mom might not look great here, but she isn't necessarily hiding some huge secret she's. Lies have inertia. Although I wonder what she thought was going to happen when she told OP, obviously OP was going to look him up."
"I'm glad people are focusing on this point. That was another time when I wasn't sure if I was in the wrong. I know now that I'm not - that was one of 2 or 3 times that it happened, and he should have been there."
"So, he gets mad about not being invited to events by people he doesn't like, who he makes no effort to be polite to.

Give yourself the best possible Christmas present this year: singlehood."
If it's clear there's no exclusivity then do what you like. If it is getting confusing then maybe you should simplify it for your say.
"Which is fair enough. But still, maybe at some point you did try to listen, but are so used to ...this...that you don't care anymore. 

I'd recommend telling him that you know he had a long day but not to dwell on work this much since he's home now. (I'd probably be annoyed by the over dramatic recallings but you could just tell him to condense his day because now that he's home, he should forget about work.)"
"&gt;Am I being disrespectful?

Absolutely, yes you are being disrespectful.   This was your BF's work party and the hostess told you it was over at midnight.  The only correct response to that is to say thank you and leave.  If you gave her a hard time when you left then you put your BF in a bad spot at his job with your terrible behavior."
Amen. OP is toast at this job. 
"First of all, take a deep breath.  I know things seem like they are spiraling out of control and you feel trapped, but a lot of this is actually just the normal kinds of development people go through in their early 20s.

Until now, your experience has mostly been with friends and relationships that were based out of childhood and proximity.  Now, you need to start learning how to develop these things as an adult.  It will take some time, but it will happen.

Unfortunately, there is unlikely to be a quick shortcut to gaining the experience you need to select quality friend/partners and develop those relationships.  However, the advice I can give would be that there are four things you should focus on:

1. **Be introspective.**  Try to evaluate situations as objectively as possible and learn from them.  What did you do right and wrong?  Were there any warning signs you missed?  Are there actions that may have alienated your friends?  The biggest key is to be honest.

2. **Try new things.**  You need to figure out who you are, so that means meeting new people, going new places, trying new hobbies, reading new books, taking adventures, etc.

3. **Work on yourself.**  You don't have to avoid relationships altogether, but if you feel broken or *need* someone in order to be happy, it is going to make you more vulnerable to these types of guys.  

4. **Get help.**  You have stated multiple times that you need someone to talk to, so go find a counselor or therapist who can do that for you.  If the person you find isn't helping find someone else.  Also, don't be afraid to go visit your family for a while.  I doubt they would want you to be feeling this way, and sometimes a hug can really go a long way.

Anyways, going forward you should make sure to choose your friends and partners very carefully.  Quality is *much* more important than quantity.  Also, I would avoid anyone who is ""broken"".  You may connect with them, but they ultimately are not going to make the kinds of friends and partners you want.

As for work, if you are seriously being harassed, I would make a post specific to that for advice.  There may be legal or other remedies for what is very inappropriate behavior.  If not though, no job is worth hating yourself over."
"Purely based on what you write, you give the impression to be rather self-righteous and self centered. That demanding attitude can be very unattractive.
For the rest, my experience is that mostly you find someone when/where you are not looking. Take a step back and look with an open mind,  also outside of your dating-binoculars."
She doesn't owe this person anything and tbh I prob wouldn't want that friend back after being ghosted when you were honest with them. 
"You can't be dating a 13 year old when you're 16. She's a child. An age difference at your age is huge. Think about what you were like when you were 13. 

15 and 17 isn't as bad, 14 and 16 isn't even so bad. But you need to cut it off for now. "
"He has to be more specific than that. The owner needs to know the details; it sounds as if this guy is defrauding customers. 

I bet he adds a lot of “other people’s drinks” to tabs and pockets the extra."
"Just tell Chuck exactly what happened, and how surprised and thrown off you were by it. Make it matter-of-fact; Bea asked you if you had romantic feelings for Ted, you assured her you didn't, and it was awkward and you want to figure out together how to move forward.

As far as Ted and Bea, absolutely do NOT bring it up with Ted. That will just reinforce her suspicions. Maybe he admitted he had a crush on you, maybe she's more insecure than you realized, maybe their marriage is kind of rocky and it's casting doubt on things for her. None of that is your responsibility to manage.

You might want to sit down with Bea now that you've processed a bit more and ask where this came from, because you've been trying to figure it out and can't. That way she can be open with you about why she brought it up, and you can express where you're coming from."
"&gt; I'm not going to destroy my body by dieting

&gt; Oh come on. It's fine if you don't want to lose weight, but saying that just sounds lazy

Exactly. I bet OP would have no problem destroying her body with food. She's already got knee and hip problems, wouldn't less weight be beneficial? But no, that would be destroying her body."
"I think the boyfriend also has to be wondering at his girlfriend's stunning lack of integrity, self awareness, and boundaries.

And why exactly he should trust her with this guy or any other of the hoards of men she's friends with, and 'is just naturally flirty' with."
"Why are you living with someone you’ve been with for 5 months? Do you know how absurd that is? Especially at your age?

20 year olds aren’t known for selflessness and it sounds like she was trying to be nice to her guest. Next time, try saying “I don’t want to sleep on the floor before work. Will you please move?” "
"We don't actually live together, though we're not like, saving ourselves for marriage or anything haha, and it's not like Tom would know. It's a Catholic university but I work in STEM and almost never see any actual Catholicism. "
"I don't think you should be quite so ready to make that assumption. One time a guy came up to me and grabbed my ass, and my first thought was ""That's weird, why would my SO do that in such a public place..."" About two seconds later, I remembered he was across the country and that it was a stranger who must have done it.

What I'm saying is that even when it's clearly not possible for it to be your SO, sometimes your brain defaults to that, because it's easier than trying to understand why a stranger would grab you for no reason.

Just talk to your wife. You said there's no text history between them, or anything else that would indicate a relationship, so you don't really have a reason to mistrust her just yet."
Someone who cheats on your 2x in 3 years is not marriage material. Cut your loss and move on. 
"“You aren’t entitled to the details of her past relationships.” — You are when it’s your father. Everyone deserves to know their origins and no one should be lied to like this. Trauma or not, it’s not okay. There probably is trauma for the mom, but she needs to *talk* to OP about it, at least enough to say something other than “I don’t know,” over and over. "
He blocked you because you broke up....
"Do not apologize. People constantly love to call out 'white privilege', but what you did was not racist in the least. She attempted to use her race as a way to shut down your rational, logical explaination and make something very minimal into a pity party for herself. The best thing you can do here is to not feed in to such utter bs. "
"&gt;however, if he’s clothed, fed, and sheltered - seems he is - it’s likely nothing will come of it. 

You're talking out of your ass. CPS recognizes child abuse and neglect in all its forms."
"Look, this guy sounds absolutely and totally unhinged. 

I'd be finishing the 'friendship' and letting all mutual friends know why, before he spins some weird narrative. 

And yes, you are totally in the right to not have anything to do with him ever again. "
"Why did your fiancé only tell you a week later about this incident? This is the issue I'm most concerned about. If it wasn't his fault, why not simply bring it up right after?"
This girl isn't your friend. She sounds like she's jealous and trying to sabotage your relationship. What would your new gf think if she read your phone with those messages? I think you need to either give her a talking to or a talking too and cut her off.
"You're helping her cheat. Stop it 

She's not being indecisive. She's having a straight up affair with you, and you feel nothing for him despite openly helping her cheat.

End it and get some therapy."
"I think this is a really valuable addition to this thread that OP should definitely pay attention to. While there may be a valid arguement for waiting a year or two due to the growing nature of teenage bodies, OP seems to have the opinion that there is something inherently morally wrong with getting a nose job, likely because a large part of her own identity grew from her own struggle and eventual acceptance of her own nose. There is nothing inherently wrong with getting a nose job, just like there isn't anything wrong with breast reduction surgery. It's just a tool available that some people decide will improve their life for the better. 

OP, your daughter isn't necessarily going to grow to love her nose like you have, and it may be that as soon as she is a legal adult, she will do whatever it takes to get her own nose job (even if that means cutting corners and going somewhere shady because she's broke). Please don't discount your daughter's feelings and experiences because you assume the outcome will be the same as your own. I think you should sit down with your daughter and husband and explain your reasons for waiting: changing bodies, a fresh start when she graduates, etc. But stop thinking of this in terms of ""If I can just stall long enough, she'll change her mind."" I think that's an unfair point of view to have, and it will only end up driving your daughter further into the conviction that this is something that she wants. "
"&gt; I certainly don't want to break up my marriage over a tiny bit of pot use. 

Then stop doing pot.

It's clearly a dealbreaker for her. She's not allowed to control your own actions but she can have dealbreakers. And not having illegal drugs in her house--however benign--is actually pretty reasonable as far as dealbreakers go. (*Especially* if she didn't know up front that you would need to do this.)

Honestly, I'm for legalizing pot. But I would be pretty grossed out if my husband felt like he *needed* to do pot regularly, no matter how small an amount. The only time he's done it was when he had serious teeth issues and vicodin just made him itchy."
"This is why I sort of raise my eyebrows when I hear somebody describe themselves as a Super Wife/Husband.

It sounds great in theory and I certainly aspire to that, but sometimes I am thinking, when reading a list like OP’s, “You know you don’t need to do all of that, right? You should be enough for your spouse without trying 210% all day every day.”

Because a lot of the time the relationship isn’t perfect after all it’s one like we’re reading about here. No matter what she does it’s never going to be enough for this guy. Even if they don’t end up splitting he’s just simmer in resentment forever that he doesn’t get literally everything he wants. "
"I have not seen the nudes, but when I confronted him he did admit to it. He claims he got the second job to pay off debt, but I feel like it’s just another lie."
"Thank you, this is a really useful way to approach it."
"This is a sad situation. I would go to couple counseling. And if it's 100% clear that it's not a viable situation, then you should separate, because you'll both be unhappy for the rest of your lives."
That's a really good point about breast feeding.  If your FIL is on the couch all day you're going to be trapped in your bedroom when you're feeding your kid.  (I'm assuming they wouldn't be comfortable with you doing it in front of him)
"&gt; I think it's because the Jews are a very tight knit community here, so people always assume that they're somehow conspiring to gain power? 

Oh, it's been a favourite ploy of bigots for centuries. First they use law/social norms to exclude and isolate a group they dislike, then turn around and use the fact that the targeted group is not more integrated and have developed internal bonds/solidarity due to the isolation forced upon them as another excuse to hate/demonize them further."
"Seriously, hard liquor vs. beer when you're talking such vast quantities doesn't matter. I work in a hospital and I've seen entirely too many young men in with issues related to drinking. Several of them ending up dead. Cirrhosis of the liver is no joke. We just put a 33 year old man on hospice as a result of his years of drinking and his stubborn refusal to quit. It's not a guarantee that your husband will end up in a similar spot, but is it worth it to him to risk that? Is drinking himself possibly to death more important than his wife and child? More important than seeing his child grow up, graduate, etc.

I'm sorry if this comes off as preachy, it's a very personal topic to me. My husband's best friend is on a similar track and it breaks my heart."
"Ha! 'm trying to imagine just how far a true next level Miley could actually go.
NLM is now at a kids party at Chuck e cheese wearing only a hat and simultaneously smoking crack and humping an animatronic bear and live streaming it on Instagram. Top that world!"
"Compromise is so important in relationships, even if you don't 100% agree with the other person. She isn't willing to sacrifice her clothing choices for just a few occasions, and probably will continue this trend in other aspects of their relationship."
"Even if it’s not a scam, even if it’s not drugs or alcohol, even if he has a truly legit/not questionable reason for being in this situation...it’s just not a good sign that he’s disclosing this to such a new person in his life. It just doesn’t show the best judgment to burden someone who doesn’t know you very well with this kind of deeply personal situation. Of course, good people get into rough situations and we all need help at times... but these particular circumstances are just red flags I think. "
"&gt; I'm shocked that your boyfriend doesn't have terrible breath.

Some people are gifted with super strong teeth, maybe her boyfriend is one of the lucky ones."
"My first thought is some kind of child support. 

I think that couples need to be financially transparent with each other. If he isn’t willing to show you itemized lists of what he has spent money on. I would be concerned. "
"&gt; So while he did chose you, and the final straw was his engagement with you, it was as much a decision to chose his own life and not the life his father wanted him live.

Yeah, I think this is important. OP, he did it for you, but he also, just as much, did it for himself. I'm sure he loves you very much and that is a large part of why he chose you, but at the same time, this wasn't like a genie came out of a bottle and said ""One time offer, pick OP or a million dollars, so strings attached."" If he had broken up with you to keep the money, it would have meant just just losing you, but ceding control of his life. How many other girlfriends would he have been forced to break up with? What other choices would his dad have forced on him? I'm sure that was all in his mind to.

Basically: I am sure you are awesome and worth it, but you also shouldn't take the weight of that lost money all on your self. That's not the price he paid to be with you, that was the price he paid for his freedom, period. Hopefully that takes the pressure and guilt off!"
"Doesn’t want him dating?  I feel like that’s one way to break your kid or make them miserable.  They’ll just go behind your back anyway, and it might make him less likely to involve you in his life later on."
 But who did you think was paying for the materials? Concrete isn't free. 
"You're both exactly right that I should stop. My mother is perceptive and can tell when I'm hiding something, though. This has kinda been the state of things since I was young, and it's hard not to tell my mother, especially when she hounds me. I feel guilty not telling her things. Thank you for this advice, though. I'll do my best to keep quiet from now on."
"Sweetie, I was 50-50 reading this, and then I realized he told her something so so so so personal of yours... It enraged me a bit, and I can tell you were hurt by this too. I would start by that, because clearly there are no boundaries set.

What u/marcelineofooo said about the chicken soup metaphor is really strong IMO, any such metaphor you can use will be a great way to show him that 

a) you're not comfortable with how he treats you and his friend

b) he needs to distinguish between friendships and relationships

c) it's not cool to share **your private experiences** with anyone

If I were you I would be livid! And my boyfriend and I are really open as well, but if he treated some one with such care and love and I was in the backseat, I would really really resent him. 

P.S. In my opinion, the fact that if you get to hang out with them is always ""their way"" (Pokemon, talking about things only the 2 of them are interested in etc) is very very unfair. He can do all of that when he's hanging with her solo, if it's the three of you, you should be way more included and your preferences should be equally respected. Just my two cents.
"
"Wow, thank you all for the comments. I appreciate getting perspectives.


I feel that I may have been in a manipulative relationship. I ignored all the signs. When I got back together with him, I was embarrassed to tell my friends. Most of them do not like him because of the way he has treated me in the past. I could only introduce him to friends who hadn't met him before. Even those friends ended up not liking him. 


He didn't seem very interested in me, and when I would bring things up he would say I was being needy, or to not be needy, or that I was a drama queen. Or he would evade my questions or change the subject. He wanted to avoid any emotional topics, and has told me that he is emotionally unavailable. 


He wasn't very good at giving me emotional support or fulfilling my emotional needs. But I know he enjoyed my emotional support and the attention I gave him. But he did kind things for me and in the end I don't think any of this was malicious. He is just fucked up and a coward. 

Writing these things, I feel stupid for ever entertaining the idea that our relationship was going to work out. I wanted it to work out so bad. I really tried. "
"I'm an expert at this. I've been heavily criticizing this subreddit for a month. Just look at my replies.

Here's what's not allowed on this subreddit that *isn't* explained in the rules:

* Sexual abuse or rape.
* Bereavement.
* Incest.
* LGBT.

The moderators will also remove any post they deem is a troll. Pretty much 50% of posts that go above 4000 upvotes get removed as well. I found this website that shows every deleted post on this subreddit. PM me if you're interested in getting a link to that."
"Am I the only one that kind of sides with the boyfriend here?

For context, I am of south Asian descent with a very Muslim sounding name. I get called a terrorist, told to go back to my country, plenty of remarks about curry, get ""randomly"" screened a lot more often than other people, etc. So I'm not foreign to how frustrating racism can be. 

I think the problem is not about racism, but that you and your boyfriend have different philosophies on how to handle things. Personally, I think ""getting in [someone's] face"" is a very immature thing to do, and would be majorly embarrassed if we were asked to leave by management.

Yes, the guy telling you to speak English is being an immature jerk. That doesn't mean you should be immature. I don't see why you have the need to give dirty looks or ""get in his face"". Why? What do you hope to accomplish? You're just going to end up escalating the situation and making it *worse*. Why do you need to ""defend"" yourself against these people? If they're being threats, that's one thing, but if they just being ignorant annoying idiots I usually take the ""just treat them like the jokes they are"" route myself.

I was quite surprised by the overwhelming number of comments here supporting escalating the situation. You say you ""would never let someone disrespect me in public"". That statement makes me think you let your pride get the best of you.

The world is full of ignorant people. If you don't grow a thicker skin and learn to not get emotional about it, you'd be angry all the time. Treat them like you treat internet trolls: just ignore them.

So I know anyone that goes against the grain in this subreddit gets downvoted (even though the downvote button is not supposed to be a disagree button). If you disagree with me and are going to downvote, please also leave a reply why you disagree "

"That's whenever I crossed the line and it was scary and very difficult to get back to normal. Be careful, please! You don't actually ""need"" to drink, you want that feeling that comes with it. I totally get it. 


What helped me dig myself out of that hole was starting with one day a week that I knew I wasn't going to drink - I would go for a long run or go play hockey instead. Maybe try that? Start small and work your way up. I'm at the point now where I'm down to maybe 6-8 drinks per week (down from 50+) and I really don't miss it on my sober days. "
"In addition, not only will he do it again, he will **ESCALATE**.

"Don't give in to the temptation to text her. I know what it feels like to be in your shoes. 

What I did when I went no contact with my ex and I wanted to text her... was text myself. And then I would answer myself.

"You are crazy if you stay with someone who believes that it's normal and healthy to abuse and manipulate their partner. Your girlfriend has severe mental problems, whether she wants to admit it or not, and you should get out of this relationship before her abuse escalates to putting you in the hospital. She is a psychopath, and that is not an exaggeration.

Do you really think it's normal for your partner to strangle you? Be honest. If a friend or loved one told you that their partner strangles them out of anger, what advice would you give them?

Look, her teary breakdowns when you try to leave are part of the cycle of abuse. She's manipulating you into staying with her. She knows she has control over you and she knows you will tolerate her abuse. None of this is healthy and there's nothing you can do to fix her since she believes her behavior is okay. She is only going to get worse, not better."

&gt; how should I feel,

However, you feel, there's no ""right"" or ""wrong"" feelings.

&gt; did I do anything wrong

It sounds like no. She just needs to be away from you and get over you.

&gt; how can I make her feel better?

You don't. You give her space and leave her alone.
"
"You sound a bit like a ""nice guy"" who thinks he needs to be a douche to meet a woman. Don't change who you are but start telling yourself you are worth it. It sounds like you might not have a great opinion of yourself and that can come across as unattractive. Try online dating (Maybe not tinder) and see who is out there and try some dates with some guys that sound worthwhile. Be upfront a bit wanting a relationship and not a hook-up. Good luck! You are worth it so don't settle right away."
"I'm not sure what you want us to say here. This is all on you. You made your bed and now you have to lie in it. Maybe if you truly cared about your boyfriend, you wouldn't have cheated. 

&gt;I want to apologize, make things right, and be with him again, but I think it's truly done.

You're right. The damage is done. You need to move on and let him be. You broke his trust. Trust is something that cannot be fixed so easily. 

Maybe look into therapy or counseling. "
"Not everybody can keep it under control; I honestly believe OP should never drink at a work function ever again. 

Workplace socializing over alcohol can be great for some people, but not people who 1) cannot control or moderate their drinking, 2) act outrageous and out of control while drinking. The twin combination of both (plus her age, she's not exactly a 21-year-old who's just learning her limits!) makes it way too risky for OP against the marginal benefits of ""bonding"". "
"If you don't want to deal with the possible effects of a bad drug experience, don't do drugs with a known lightweight just before an important event."
Learn tact. Complete honesty in all things is never the best policy. You didn't need to tell her everything. You did that because you wanted to hurt them both.
"Nah. The issue is that someone who’s insecure would find this obnoxious/an attack when it’s normal behavior within her lifestyle. If they were comfortable with their health/weight they wouldn’t mind, and realize this is part of her lifestyle. Offering people fruit instead of greasy sugary stuff is just what you do when you care about food or health, it’s not personal. Why would you give guests something you find harmful/not good enough for yourself? 

I do agree that they could perceive it as obnoxious. But that makes it a miscommunication to me. "
"Well then while I understand why you're upset, you are an adult. You made the decision to not go. You knowingly gave up your dream. 

You can end the relationship, but it's not her fault. "
"&gt; Is it a coincidence that he exactly failed what was prohibited?

I’m sorry, I don’t know how to word this without getting my comment deleted, but I’m seriously doubting your intellect. Of course it’s not a coincidence that the only rules he broke are “exactly” what was prohibited. That’s sort of wrapped up in the definition of breaking a rule."
"Yeah, this may be a sign to drop the new guy and move on to someone that won't get in the middle of things that aren't their business and will actually have your back."
"Don't discuss this couple with co-workers, don't discuss Samantha or their marriage with Sam, and avoid being alone with Sam at all costs. Pull back on the time you spend around Sam in group settings.

"True, but she has now shaved and he has made it apparent that he is punishing her for not shaving. Its not the sex thats the issue. "
"This is so true. My nephew has autism and ashbergers. His social interaction differs, he speaks English well but can't quite understand human feeling unless it's his own. Since a kid he had a bad mouth and would curse at his parents and I would always correct him because I don't give a fuck. If you have some sense to curse someone out in full sentences l, you have enough sense to know the meaning and to know what is the morally way to behave. "
"Hi! I'm 21(f) and I used to be like your girlfriend!

It takes a lot of personal growth on her part as well as patience and reassurance on your part (just don't let her walk all over you either). 

My SO cut off contact (without me asking) with his previous flings and it helped a lot. I still got jealous occasionally , but eventually kept telling myself he loves me and that if he wanted those other girls he would be with them and not me. He would reassure me as well, and it eventually dwindled. 

Here's how I think of it now, and maybe letting your SO know to think these will help her as well: 

1) While I only had one other partner other than my current SO, he had around 5 including me. This used to bother me, BUT it's comforting to think that he is now out of this stage of life, and he most likely won't get curious of what other girls / sex with other girls will be like to the point of him acting on it. He already has had a variety now and knows what to expect, where as someone who has only had one partner might get curious enough to act.

2) You are with HER because you love HER

3) This is usually something deeper with insecurities about themselves , so consider helping her by maybe saying ""Babe, you look beautiful today"" and also helping herself feel this way too (love yourself first right? ) And have her tell herself three good things about herself each day, psychical or not.

4) Maybe cut off contact or decrease contact with these past flings, if you even are in contact with them. 

5) Have a deep conversation with her about what she wants, what you can do to help ease her fears and also express how this makes you feel


Hope this helps a little ! "
"Irrelevant. She wasn't looking for a participant. She's 19, she's allowed to be curious about her sexuality. "
"I think the word you're looking for is ""moving out""."
"You're an adult in your late twenties in a long term relationship. Don't pressure your gf into aborting. You have already expressed your opinion, but it is her body. Pregnancy is a known potential outcome of sex. It's time for you to pull yourself out of your pity party and plan for the situation. Whether you want to stay in the relationship or not, you need to be a good parent. "
"Wow, they must have been so confused when she fell pregnant! How great for them though. 

From memory, I think our friend had an accident and was told as a result of his injuries he was infertile. Evidently, not so much. "
"Because she has the right to bodily autonomy. And he does have a say in that he gets the right to express his opinion, and he can walk away if he likes and only pay child support. That’s just how the biology of pregnancy works. "
"&gt; It's a shame the moderators are going to remove this post.

Why *do* so many posts get removed? I've seen several go just today (the ones with the gay guy with the misogynistic boyfriend and the guy who thought all his girlfriend's exes were losers spring to mind), which seemed like perfectly reasonable topics for this sub and no drama going on in the comments or anything. I don't understand?"
"So your dad will let his new girlfriend abuse his daughter and chooses her over his daughter when called out.    
He has officially failed as a dad and you should let him know."
Why would he stay in a hotel when you live so close? That's really suspicious. 
"You also aren't supposed to hide things from your spouse. Or break their things. Or ignore them for a month. Etc. Etc. 

Also if the only reason you're not starting the divorce process is because you can't until he gets back, is he really still your spouse in all the ways that count? At the end of the day you have to do what you have to do to be healthy and happy. If he's not apart of that, he's not apart of that. Focus on what you need to do to take care of yourself (physically, mentally, and emotionally). It doesn't seem like he wants to communicate with you anyway. Use this time to focus on yourself. "
There there. Have a hug.
I'd reach out. I'd make sure your GF is aware of it so it doesn't seem shady but I think it's a good idea.
Me too! Not just that he would have caught the cold then still needed to work to support them and he just started a new job so that looks really bad on him. As a sick person you should do what you can to try not to infect everyone around you. 
"She’s unsure of her relationship with you? I’D be unsure about being in a relationship with an abuse apologist.
Sounds like she expects you guys to get closer. I certainly wouldn’t want a dude who took advantage of a 15 year old to be a part of my family. Obviously you don’t either."
"Don't engage.  It's not a discussion.  It's not up for debate.  You don't have to convince her of anything, she's not sitting on a jury and she doesn't get a vote.  

"
"Look, I understand - your brother and SIL sound irresponsible and should not be thinking about a kid. But honestly, you sound like you would be the person nitpicking a friend for eating fast food and claiming it’s okay because you’re right. It’s not about right. It’s their choice and not yours. "
But it is quite honestly the funniest thing I've ever read on this sub. 
Wow man I'm sorry. First this dude is not your friend anymore. Cut him out. Don't be civil etc. Second your ex did you dirty. Clearly she is going to have sex with this guy. Don't take her back. Is it possible for you to transfer and start anew somewhere else? I think you need a clean break so you're not reminded of these 2. My bet is that six months from now your ex will come crawling back (depending on whatever chemicals her brain reacts to next)' when that happens remember what she did 
"&gt; He did you a favor by saving you from a marriage that he wasn't fully committed to. Now he has set you free to find the perfect life for you. When you think about your marriage, I'm sure you envision being married to someone who is eager and excited to be with you. That's not this guy. Now you are free

This!"
"I totally get that, and get being non-confrontational. But this guy is asking for it. I think you really need to be upfront about this. ""Why are you acting so weird about this? You know he's not your dog, right? Get your own if you want one that badly. If you can't follow the rules everyone's agreed to about MY dog maybe you shouldn't live here.""

I would have had some patience if he was just being overenthusiastic about spending time with the dog, but the second he started berating you as an owner and talking shit to your roommates, you should've been telling him to knock it off."
Is it bad that I’m sitting here reading all these comments saying it’s okay thinking that if I did this my gf would freak at me? Might need to bite the bullet and post on this sub
"Your sister is very good at manipulating you. I'm almost envious. You need to get wise to her tactics, because this is what they are, tactics. You need to stop being naive.

You're being manipulated, so you're not seeing this clearly. You see your sister as a kind, good-hearted person, who simply can't help that she just doesn't have enough money, and the poor girl is going to go hungry, and you're eating takeout, and your poor little sister just doesn't have anything, and she's so upset, and you should just be a nice person and give her some takeout. Right? And if you don't, you're a horrible monster who needs to feel guilty and terrible, because you weren't kind to your poor sister who does so much for you and cares about you and loves you. Right? Is this ringing a bell?

I've posted about my cousin Melissa in here before. Poor little Melissa. With her awful, abusive childhood. Poor Melissa, who was so pretty that the boys couldn't help but do her homework in school, so she never learned anything, so how could she possibly get a job? It wasn't her fault that the boys fought to do her homework, was it? It wasn't her fault that she's just so nervous around people that she can't get a job. So, of course I had to help her out, and give her money, and support her. Because that's what family does, right? At least, that's what she always told me when she called me crying because she couldn't afford to pay her cable bill, or whatever bill it was she couldn't pay because she spent all her money on purses or Yankees tickets or whatever. And of course, of course I paid her rent for her. Of course I paid her cable bill for her. What kind of horrible, selfish monster would I be if I wasn't there for poor Melissa? Poor, poor Melissa, who had such a rough childhood, who just never learned how to take care of herself, and is that her fault? No, Society made it so hard for her,  Melissa said that society makes it so hard for pretty girls to be independent, she just always had things done for her, so how on Earth was it ever her fault, she tried so hard but everyone just did everything for her, what could she possibly do? So I paid, and paid, and paid. If only Society would change so that life would be easier for poor Melissa! And since Society isn't changing, it was up to me, dolphinesque, to step in and save her, to pay her bills for her, because if I didn't, she made it perfectly clear that I was the worst monster that ever walked this Earth. She would cry, she would slam doors, she would tell me that we weren't even family anymore. She would sob hysterically and ask if I ever even cared about her at all. She would say that if the situation was reversed, she wouldn't hesitate to pay all of my bills. She would absolutely take care of me in a heartbeat if she could, and yet I couldn't even give her $80 for her cable bill, what kind of horrible person was I? 

I'm in therapy now, thank goodness. And Melissa is no longer in my life as of last year. But trust me, you need to set those boundaries now. If I had set those boundaries early on. You need to stop feeling guilty about your sister situation. She makes as much money as you, and if she's squandering it, that's on her.

Go ahead and order take out. When your sister says to order some for her, say you're going to have to pay for it. When your sister cries and makes you feel guilty, this is when you need to set boundaries the most. This is when you need to stay the strongest. She's going to make you feel incredibly guilty. She's going to tell you you're a horrible brother, that she's starving, that she's so hungry her stomach is growling and hurting, that she's so miserable and unhappy, that she feels like you don't love her, that she feels like you're so distant from her, that she sees a future where her future children will never know their Uncle because you're so distant from her, she's really going to lay it on thick. You will feel like you are literally stabbing her in the heart, because she has trained you to feel that way.

Your sister is being selfish and unreasonable. Do not pay for any more take out, or anything else for her. She's not managing her money properly, and that's not your problem. She is making it your problem, and it's only your problem if you agree to take it on. Do some Googling, and learn about setting boundaries."
"You made a series of conscious decisions that led you to sleeping with this either guy. Engaging him in conversation. Hanging out all day. Flirting with him. Going somewhere private with him. Kissing him. Getting yourself undressed. Allowing him inside you. All of it was a series of choices made by you, and at each choice you had to decide that what you are doing at that moment was more important than a half-decade relationship with your boyfriend. Considering all that, how in the world do you think your bf could ever have trust in you again?  This wasn’t an accident. It was like you grabbed your relationship by the throat, choked it out, kicked the shit out of it, and then shot it in the head a few times for good measure. And now you’re asking how you can bring that broken, shot and bled-out relationship back to life because you regret brutally murdering it. Sorry. Can’t be done. 

All you can do is work on yourself. Ya, it’s gonna hurt. And you should have the guilt that you deeply hurt (and probably permanently emotionally scarred) someone you loved. You need to take and learn from that. Make yourself a better person. Use that pain during your next relationship when you are tempted to cheat. Be that friend who steps in and prevents your friends from cheating on their own partners. In time, your pain will lessen, and you will likely find someone else. But always remember how you feel now so that you don’t make this mistake again.  "
is there a legal precedent for bitcoin yet if the cousin steals it back? i would love to hear an attorneys viewpoint on this.
I believe ”tough titties” is a proper response
LMFAO I'm so glad I'm not the only one that's sorts by controversial. This shit is so entertaining and ridiculous. I literally can't believe people like OP exist 
Don't be afraid about reporting her for assault.  
"It really reads like you're afraid of upsetting her. Every message of yours reads like ""Hey, so I was just wondering - and it's cool either way!!! - but like, just theoretically... And I don't want you to feel bad! It's okay!""

Like, you're just reassuring her so much and hedging/defending everything you say, it makes me sad. Either you're super insecure, or she gets completely out of control when she's upset."
But he’s still keeping your relationship a secret from her? Hmmm...
There's no way their bills are the same as utilities/bills.

"? She wasn’t pressuring him, all she did was propose because she thought they were on the same page—he told her in the OP that he would like to be married and didn’t want pressure of proposing first, so she proposed first. She didn’t pressure him to get her pregnant either, she just said she would like to have kids someday. This isn’t a maturity conflict. It was a misunderstanding. Yes, it was silly of her to propose so soon since he’s only 21, but he did unintentionally lead her on and they talked it through in the end..."
Yea wtf? This didn't seem like anything was actually fixed and it seemed like it would just make things worse.
"So if I’m reading this right, you have an internship at a generally large company. You shadowed an older man who was polite, professional and helpful. You weren’t able to talk about anything non-work related all day. You both sent each other progressional emails in regards to the visit ... I’m struggling to see how any of this leads to any obvious romance? He seemed strictly professional. Is it really worth risking your internship over this? Do you even know if he’s married? I would avoid it. Focus on what you got the internship for. "
"&gt; revenge fantasy

Yeah, that's why I can't completely blame OP's family for this. She didn't have a struggle with her conscious as to whether report her sister or not. She just wanted to be malicious because they had an argument.

I think her sister is 99% a shit person in this situation (welfare scam and snooping), but I also don't think it's healthy to only report crimes because you feel pissy at the person."
"This is the best advice. She's embarrassing HERSELF. People won't take her seriously, she's going to stop getting invited to things all together and she'll eventually get in trouble in work. "

"Are these people who would also be down to hang out doing more ""tame"" things? Like are there a couple of them you could see going on hikes with, or out to lunch and a movie, etc? Things where drug use would be absurd? 


Because if they're cool to hang out with sober, then I'd just see less of them. Like, I have lots of friends who partake in recreational drugs and while I no longer do, they're not the types that make me feel like an asshole if I don't. They also don't care if I bounce early from a party. We go do camping trips in the summer where no drugs (minus weed) are involved and they're legit people.


If I were in your situation, I'd just bail. I'd be like ""man, I got fucking scheduled for work. I am so mad; they want me in the next morning of the concert :-( fuck shitty coworkers!"" Or whatever. Blame it on your nursing schedule.


Then just enjoy them when they're not doing drugs. If they only ever want to hang out when they're high, I'd move along."
What part of “package deal” are you having trouble understanding?
Do you live at your parent's home and are you financially dependent on them?  The way you approach this will be heavily dependent on these answers.
"&gt; Please can anybody give me any advice on how to handle this?

Depending on the country you're in, google gynos/doctors/health clinics around you and call them today. Make an appointment to talk to them.... in most countries, you'll probably have to wait another 1-3 days until you can actually get an abortion.

&gt; All I want to do is call my mom, but I know she doesn't believe in abortion, especially when it comes to her kids. 

Then I wouldn't call her right now tbh.

"Has she looked into churches in the area? You say she talks about religion and if there's anything most country folks love it's church. She'd be able to meet people with similar views and maybe make friends. Plus, it might make her feel more at home, since most people down south go to church every week. "
"Exactly.  I work in a client/consulting based industry, and if you can't hold your liquor, you can't be trusted to entertain a client on behalf of the company.  That's not that important on a lower level, but the people who make manager can't have that type of black mark on their record because going out for drinks with potential clients is necessary to secure contracts."
"It won't last, he will be your friend again. She's gonna screw up again, and whatever happens, *whatever happens* he'll never trust her completely again."

"It definitely wasn't a mistake, but I've had friends in the service industry respond to low tips in a joking manner, apologize for something they didn't do right, or ask if there's anything they could have done to make the customer's experience better, and if that had been the case (and the guy seemed like he was genuinely trying to make up for poor service) I probably would have given him a few more bucks. This was not the case. "
The plans had been confirmed previously.
"Well, how about a compromise? Your sister-in-law sees her childhood friends, and your brother attends Christmas Eve with your parents as arranged?"
I agree. Op needs to consult a divorce attorney before moving forward with any sale/ reclassification of assets. He may be screwing himself while grieving.
"Neither does weed, for that matter."
"I think you made the right choice. 

For me, it's not just the fact that he put his hands on you, it's the fact he got so wound up and belittled you, when you hadn't done anything wrong. 

You texted him around 1am with a clear message about what you were doing, where you were and why, getting home around 2am is completely reasonable in those circumstances. I don't think you had anything to apologise for in the first place. Why does he get to berate you for that?"
"Don't tolerate people who ask questions they might not like the answer to. 

Tell him ""BF, you asked me what I thought, and I told you. I don't like lying to my SOs.""

Maybe now that he knows the truth, he'll be more careful choosing his gifts for you. Imagine; if you had lied, this might have continued every Holiday."
"When you say: ""I'm sorry, it's because we havent had sex in 2 months"" she will automatically claim responsibility. Do NOT tell her this is the reason, because in reality that's a bullshit excuse.... I'm 27 dating a man with a spine injury. We've gone more than two months before.... I can get dick very easily... but I dont because he needs me to wait. I don't care what drug I've been on, how much I've drank... having another man inside me makes me sick to even think about. So drop that stupid excuse.

"So you guys don't seem compatible at all, but more than that you should probably look at your ""oh I'm so not like other girls"" shtick.

""There's nothing wrong with that kind of girl.""
""..would clue anyone into the idea I'm one of those girls.""

That's fine to have interests that don't jive with your boyfriend's but it also sounds like you don't even try to check out what he's interested in, what's important enough for him to share with you.

Or, I'd say that in a normal case since he's clearly into the idea of you and not the you that you are. I don't know if you've ever tried to pay attention to something he likes and wants to show you more than just ""smiling and nodding and going back to (my own) hobby"" because maybe there's aspects of these things you might like and you could share with him, but yeah, after you leave him as you really don't seem compatible just try to keep that sort of thing in mind for future relationships. You don't have to love something your partner loves but at least take interest, try it out with a clear and open mind, and ""not like other girls""ing isn't cute. "
"These are the kind of things, that need to just be said. There’s no easy way, there’s no Band-Aid. You just need to do it the best you can and try to not upset her."
Why not try to actively correct that part of your life you're ashamed? Why be complacent in the bettering of your own life?
OK how do you break out of this and have equal relationships where people reciprocate what you give? I feel like I try to match or equal what people give me at the start but then I just end up with empty friendships and relationships that eventually die off. 
"I am the daughter of a FIFO worker who called frequently and all that jazz, its no where near hands on parenting. People who say it is just so that so they feel better. This guy is already on rocky ground with his kids given he pretty much didn't parent them for their lives already, so I think if he wants to continue to improve that relationship then the best way is to be hands on. If he doesn't want to then he can do whatever he wants."
"OP did nothing wrong, it’s ridiculous that you think a persons privacy is more important than the wellbeing of her and her child. "

I’m quite apprehensive about telling her. She’ll almost definitely blow up and I feel like she’ll get pissed at me. 
"&gt; she was looking for something to get mad at

Bingo. She already doesn't like him so now anything slightly inappropriate will receive this type of reaction.

OP, I would absolutely be concerned. She disrespectfully lashed out at everyone - even people who weren't involved - for a comment that realistically could be met with an eye roll and a joke back. I would recommend that you try the ""agree to disagree"" approach in the future, but I suspect she would react equally as badly to that.

From your edit, it seems like you two have made up so you are unlikely to stay on top of this. So now that the original argument has been resolved (as much as it can be), I would recommend that you be honest with her and let know how concerned you are about her reaction. Try to talk through how to prevent a repeat of this type of blow up in the future (don't just accept platitudes from her but rather have her come up with concrete actions to prevent another meltdown). Let her reaction to your concerns dictate how you move forward here. (I suspect her reaction to you voicing your concerns here will not be good.) "
"It's not so easy that's it's black and white like that. If it was a bad breakup, she maybe didn't want all the reminders of him in her life with co parenting and all. Not to say she is right because she's not. But it seems to be a very hard time for her and she hoped you wouldn't find out and now you have and of course, you are very upset. I'm not saying you should forgive her but give each other time and let her think about what she wants to say to you instead of just firing off questions which of course she can't give a straight answer when there could be a variety of factors. "
"Yeah, he’s trying to pretend that OP doesn’t know how it feels when she faced the exact same thing. Not only that, but he’s saying he thinks she needs a nose job, but he’s married to someone with the same nose, so....."

"OP I think you guys should just slow it down and communicate. It sounds like he really does like you, but has some trouble expressing it. He might even like you so much that he's feeling weird about it because it's only been 3 months. It sounds like you have a lot of feelings for him too. Talk it out OP. Make sure you're being heard and feeling like he's taking your feelings and this relationship seriously. It sounds like you got through to him with whatever you said while drunk.... so talk to him and see what you said lol"
How do you know? Have you spoken with a lawyer? You can get child support and maybe alimony. Your family can help. You can finish your degree and support yourself with your own career. You have options.

"Dude, give her a few weeks before you start thinking the intimacy of the relationship is forever changed. Being rejected for a proposal is emotionally gutting. You were right to say no if it’s not what you wanted but she is probably trying to force a little emotional distance for herself from such a vulnerable moment. 

Talk to her, tell her all the things you’ve been saying in replies in this thread and also give her a little time for things to go back to normal."
"You have a husband problem, not a sister problem.  Your husband is obviously desperate, but if your sister was going to bail you out, she would have offered by now.  She may be willing to down the line if things get worse, but you'll have to have exhausted every other option first.  

Starbucks and Costco pay fairly decently.  Contact job training locations and see if they can hook one of you up with a road crew if you're not in the snowy north.

Medical bills can be negotiated down or deferred--call the billing departments.  CHIP/Medicaid for the kids if they're not already on it.  Food stamps/TANF if you qualify.  WIC if your kids are under 5 and you qualify.  Sublet and move in with parents if possible and legal.  Public transportation if it's cheaper than car insurance.  Some transportation agencies will subsidize costs for lower income folks.  Food banks.  Your church if you belong to one of decent size.  "
"This here is literally one of the worst comparisons I have heard in my life. How the fuck are they the same?

1. Never farting in front of your SO is something that implies you will have to control some BIOLOGICAL function for the rest of your life, function which is not in your power to control when asleep and other factors come into play. Not kissing/eating someone out during sex is a completely different thing.

2. You can DISAGREE with the conditions your SO lays out. You can flat out say you can't do that and then see where it goes. This is like saying that because a couple decides to be monogamous it's ok to cheat because one of them only agreed to please the other. "
"If you read /r/raisedbynarcissists, you're probably familiar with ""FLEAS.""

"I've got to be honest, reading all his post &amp; comments makes me think he *isn't* as happy and willing to forgo big boobs as he says.

Having a preference isn't a big deal. But OP describes it as ""lasagna vs plain bread"" and he keeps referencing basically telling her ""this is all I watch because big tits are SOOOOOOOOOO important to me. but don't worry, you have a good personality, and no worries, I can get off to anything, it's just not as fun!"" 

He seems unwilling to just watch the porn with her. Then if she says something, encourage her that he finds her *just as sexy* as them. (Of course, he wouldn't be able to do this, because he *doesn't* think she's just as sexy....)

I hope homegirl finds someone who thinks she lasagna. And honestly, I hope OP breaks up with her and finds someone he views as lasagna."
I love the idea of a girl convincing the guy she likes to have sex *with another man* in order to win him over. In what world would that ever work?
Hell no on the money. She doesn't owe him money just because he went nuts and dropped cash like it was a mike. That's on him.
"Aside from what everyone else is discussing (and they’re all correct - this guy is not good), I just want to point out that it is fucking *bizarre* that your boyfriend took the first opportunity to tell you he didn’t like your sister, who you said is your best friend, because she was “too bubbly.” You were rightfully sad, but you should have also been astounded. Who the hell does that? Especially at the *beginning* of a week-long stay?! That was manipulative and cruel of him, and I agree with the other commenters who said that it could be the beginning of abuse. Why the hell else would he insult your sister, and your love for your sister, so readily? "
Hopefully mom tells Mark he needs to find somewhere else to live.
"The kid is 9 and you've been with your husband for *almost* 10 years, so she could have been conceived right before you got together? I feel like there's more to the story and it may be that she's his daughter. Ugh 

His family sounds objectively disrespectful even if you personally brush off their comments/rudeness :\ You don't deserve to be made to feel like second fiddle in your own marriage."
Yeah I was going to say you should cut him wome slack until I read about the street art shit. I wholeheartedly agree with this comment. 
No we have agreed on an abortion! In the meantime I just dont know what to do about these horrible symptoms.
Yeah that's a huge up yours to your kids and ex that you are going overseas for three years. That's not parenting. 
"&gt; How do I nicely convince her? 

Why do you have to convince her? The ring/gem is in your possession. She gets no say.

&gt; She hasn't officially said no, but she's not thrilled at the idea either.

Of course she's not, she doesn't like your boyfriend for whatever reason, and you think she's jealous. Does that mean you're going to stall your wedding or swap out your boyfriend, just to make her happy?

Live your life. Don't worry about what your sister wants, let her figure that out for herself. "
"After learning the hard way myself, I can’t overemphasize this!"

Why not? Serious question.
He's gaslighting you. It sounds like he's trying to manipulate you by playing on your insecurities. He sounds like an awful partner. You deserve better

He made plans to spend time with his family. He’s not obligated to change this. You’ll have to go without him.

"Filter out the jab, say thanks and give to goodwill/sell on ebay as you always would. Cut contact as soon as you're able and minimise as much as possible in the meantime. Same plan as you've probably had for ages. hasn't changed.

If she asks about you using it/having it make up some bs story about how there was a family in your are who's house burned down and they lost most of their kitchen shit, so since you didn't use that stuff much anyway you gave it to them. 

Though first check through it for shit you would actually use. Some of it's pretty decent and why let a jab at your weight stop you from having nice shit? "
"Your expecting your brother to read your mind. If you would have just started what you wanted in the first place you wouldn't be in this situation. It's your fault with no fault on his own. But if you don't want him there tell him he gotta get a hotel, I don't think you need to sugar coat it just say I wanna have some alone time on my wedding night and wasn't thinking when I offered to let you stay at my house. You're  over thinking it."
"Yeah, I'm really sorry to say this, but I'm not convinced that he'd be very supportive in that case at all. Which to me is a huge red flag. Again, even for a friend if someone important to them died, regardless of my relationship with their friend/family member/whoever, I would be sad for them and support them however I can. It's really discouraging to find out that someone you care deeply about doesn't show signs of fundamentally caring about the things that are important to you, and I'm so sorry. 

I don't think you need to wait for further evidence of his lack of support. I would rely on your friends for support right now and distance yourself from him. If he cares more about being right than he does about you, you'll only continue to be disappointed by the lack of the support you need in a romantic relationship."
To be honest one of the actual differences is something you said in your post. He's had 20+ relationships and partners and you've had.. one. There is a difference in life experience right there.

"This is *how* you *stay* self sufficient. 

Pretty much every job I've gotten, I've gotten because people knew me and got along ok with me, or someone they knew vouched for me. 

I didn't *stay* employed because of that, I stayed employed because I did the work well. 

Especially with *family* or close friends, the line of self sufficiency is blurred. Family is *supposed* to help  you better yourself. Heck, if your brother has any connections who can help your husband get a better job, you should be asking him to do so as well. 

Give your brother a big thank you for hooking you up with your current job, but nobody is going to keep on someone who doesn't do the job well. You are *staying* employed because of what you are bringing to the table. "
"So true. The other day my dog ran away and it didn’t even cross my mind to hop into bed with one of my friends because of it.

We did find her in the end though. But I can’t imagine I’d of done it even if we didn’t, lol."
"&gt; Am I wrong for sometimes (fleetingly) considering ending the relationship and remaining best friends with her whilst I look for another partner who is more on the same level as me when it comes to physical needs?

Figure out why you feel you can't find a relationship where all of your needs are satisfied, including sexual ones.  Don't settle for one where they aren't."

(As I suggested in my other comment, look into volunteers for getting her around with people her own age and dog walkers perhaps)."
Your MiL is tactless but it is absolutely unfair of you to make your husband miss his parents 50th anniversary party. You don’t have to go but don’t force him to sit out.

Yes. Yes you did. He can only be as old as he is. He cannot be any older than 21.

As he should. Its a damn bachelor party! He's a 21 year old male! He's not allowed to drink?

They're 21 year old college students. Of course they are.

Its not.


You need to seriously grow up. You are not mature enough for marriage. "
"Super rude. Even if I was ghosting someone out of disinterest, if that person bought tickets to something inviting me, I'd at least respond a definitive no, out of common courtesy."
"No, it's not odd. It's the reality of being a sexually active woman. The reality is: if women get pregnant, they are in an extremely vulnerable position if the man who impregnates them chooses to be un-supportive. And so no, you don't get an equal say. Because she automatically carries a greater risk and, unless you CHOOSE to take equal responsibility, she carries the full responsibility. Even if you SAY you would behave in such and such way, she has basically no way of knowing for certain your actions would live up to your promises. 

Even if she's on birth control, this is still part of her reality in a way that it is not part of your reality.

Tell her the truth as you know it, but be clear with her that you would support whatever she felt was the best choice for her body/life.

Unless you're intentionally planning on having a kid, which (hopefully) would imply a degree of commitment and stability that would provide support for her and the baby, that is the best you can offer. 
"
Thank you. I really needed to see this.
"The same night??

I would be extremely upset if my partner proposed to me when we had both been drinking, *especially* if it was following a huge fight where he literally threw the ring at me and told me to marry myself. If you heard that was the proposal story of another couple would you think their relationship was healthy?"
"Um, because they're friends? Friends talk about interests and stuff they like."
"Why?  She's probably not telling you because she's sad/ashamed/blocking the past and that her 17 year long lie has come to the surface.

So in a sense she too is experiencing this for the first time.  It's not fair, you're right about that.   But you've got him now so try to think positively about that.

You can assume a lot of things here and they are probably true to some degree.  She hid him because she was selfish.  She didn't want to share you with him, she didn't want the complication of him in your lives after the relationship went bad.  Then she continued because it was easier to keep lying than confront her own lies and the truth.

So unless there is something hiding here like cheating or beating you can sense why.

What to do though, since it's so emotional for both of you still is maybe say ""hey this is huge how about we ignore it for a week or two, think on our own, and try to talk next weekend"".   Or take that time and write it out in a letter.   

You should feel hurt and you'll both have to feel your way forward, but slowly is good here so nobody gets too emotional and you're just arguing.  Good luck and good luck with bio dad"
"Reasoning: You will give them fuel to fight you. You will open up to them, and they will twist and manipulate what they learn in order to further abuse you.

Like, previously, you said that you felt bad leaving someone who is mentally ill. Well, if she finds that out, then she is going to lay on the guilt about how you are leaving her in her time of need. Because she knows this is a button to push with you. 

A non-abusive person? They would hear that, and feel awful that another person was with them out of obligation. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, u/SaucySaboeuse, or if there is anything else to add. "
"Yeah, I think that's a red flag. Until you said that he said ""Sure, I'll tell my girlfriend I gotta leave."", I wouldn't have been surprised if it turned out he had another GF. Like, given his apparent social aptitude, he should be trying to make sure you're not lonely and inviting you out to have some fun with his friends. Something is off.

Have you spoken to him about this? If not, why not? That's also a red flag because you two aren't communicating."
"Because the total stranger is related to your sibling, and in most cases, is seen to be a kind if not polite gesture? It isn't that serious.

It’s not like they’re just unfeeling husks who feel nothing whatsoever when other people get severely injured."
"&gt;i assume you are abstinent because of religious reasons since you mentioned a christian dating site. do you attend church regularly? are there any singles mixers there? can you suggest that they hold one?

Yes, I am a devout Catholic. I attend Mass every Sunday and even attend daily Mass at least 3 times per week, so yeah very regular. Where I am it seems that the Mass attendees skew much older than me. I honestly never seem to see young women at Mass. They seem to be a rare species in the Catholic church I attend Mass at, weirdly."
"Your girlfriend is abusive. She is demanding you to demean yourself to stroke her ego. This isn't about improving your relationship, it's about her power trips.

... What is he spending his money on then??? Does he do drugs or gamble or something?
I'm guessing that she's more upset about the concussion and focusing on the girlfriend thing because it's something that makes her feel more in control. Your son falling while just walking home from school and getting hurt is one of those things that can hit a parent the wrong way and make them totally freak out at the reality that they can't protect their kids all the time no matter how much they want to. She'll probably relax a little once he's feeling better. 
"I’m an ER nurse. I have no idea why you would have wanted your husband to bring your kids in to a small room in essentially a germ factory.

You weren’t dying, he made the right choice. "

I don't think that is cruel it all. I know me. I would end up resentful of the disabled child and that would translate to that child's life in some fashion. It's not just monetarily supporting the child that matters; it is also emotional. I have no shame admitted I could not do handle it. That doesn't mean I hate disabled kids or would support them in other ways. 
"Has he threatened divorce or (before you were married) breaking up for random reasons previously? Is there anything else odd about how he's been behaving recently? Honestly, as hard as it might be, consider instead of crying and getting hysterical and demanding to talk to him about this (as understandable as that reaction is), just not responding and leaving the ball in his court. He's lashing out and seeking some kind of reaction from you, it seems clear whatever's going on is about him and not due to anything you've done. So just focus on yourself and the baby and your support network (friends and family) and be cold, polite and distant with him. Maybe it's immature but just disengage and give him the silent treatment for a while. Also in the meantime look into resources others have suggested to get some legal advice and be prepared in case he does want to divorce.

If he tries to become affectionate and reconcile  pretend like everything is normal again, insist that he have a proper conversation with you first and explain what caused him to threaten divorce and lash out at you without warning like he did. If he really does want to divorce, let him bring it up and take steps to do so."
"I think it would be a safe bet to transition back to condoms, and make sure you are genuinely comfortable before doing anything. Maybe you could try taking a bath together or giving each other massages to feel more intimate, and see if it helps you regain enjoyment sexual contact. You can start slow with just some touching, you don’t need to plunge right back into penetration. Abortions are monumentally sobering and it’s often a process that involves some degree of grief.
Just communicate with your boyfriend about how you’re feeling and take things slowly."
"I got married outdoors, by the water at sunset. We wanted everybody to have a good time and be relaxed, so we made sure that the bar was set up and open while guests arrived. They were able to have fun and relax from the get-go, and it worked, lol, we didn't have guests in pajamas, but there was no stuffiness or stodginess at our wedding, and everybody really seemed to appreciate it. "
"Yeah man, such a hassle."
"&gt; The thing is, no one ""needs"" make up, you're smearing paint on your face for fun

Yes this. I'm always very careful when talking to tiny children about putting on makeup to tell that ""I'm putting on makeup to make my face look different!"" Not ""This is what a lady does to look pretty!"" or even ""This is what I do so I look pretty."" because fuck, I'm pretty either way, but it's nice to have a range of looks.

"When my partner acts as if completely ridiculous and illogical things are normal, I tend to second guess myself and go to crazyland with them, which is messed up. This relationship has been a lesson in trusting my intuition and from it, I'm hoping to have a stronger sense of self. 

This part is only retrospectively funny: when we would argue, he once justified it by saying that john lennon cheated, left yoko ono for another woman, and later came back to yoko. It was if he said that to show that his behavior was totally normal and I was the crazy one. I love yoko, but how insulting!"
