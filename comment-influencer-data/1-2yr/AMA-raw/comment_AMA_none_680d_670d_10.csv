"I forgot to grab the direct link to the original post or the original comment in the chain, but I went through your whole post history (that the mobile app will show me, anyway) and found these two comments of yours from **ONE YEAR AGO:**

&gt;*Don't forget that Kevin Spacey was on those flights.  Spacey fanboys on Reddit vote me down into oblivion every time I mention it but I have seen enough with my own eyes to know that Kevin Spacey's day will come in the bullseye of these types of allegations.  You've been warned, kids.*

and:

&gt;*I did not see banging.  I saw pubescent boys in his lap, dancing for and massaging him, etc in a VIP room at a nightclub in an Asian country.  It was fucking foul.  In a developed country, I'd have broken his face then called the cops.  In that country, I just felt nauseous and walked away.  He has an army of lawyers that comb the Internet for reports of his sick predilections but if you Google him specifically around those predilections, you'll find a few things that have survived.  Like I said, don't be surprised when the news breaks wide open.  It's inevitable.*

Just in case anyone else wanted to go through the history to find the old comments OP mentioned, you don't need to now."
Ever see the Family Guy episode where Stewie runs half naked(or fully naked) across the house screaming about escaping from Kevin Spacey's basement? 
What nightclub was this in? I live in Thailand and if there’s underage prostitution I’ll report it to the authorities 
"Thank you so much for writing about this before anyone knew a thing, /u/El_Cochinote . Looks like the media has already picked up on your story. Just came across [tthis article](https://www.inquisitr.com/4608279/a-reddit-user-exposed-kevin-spacey-as-a-pedophile-years-ago-after-seeing-him-with-shirtless-boys-in-thailand/) on twitter. 

Enjoy your five minutes of internet fame. You're famous for the right reason. "
"I love the ""RemindMe 3 years Is Kevin Spacey exposed as a pedo"" comment. That's just unreal seeing that."
Seth MacFarlane should make a list or something.
"I saw Spacey sitting in private VIP room at a mixed nightclub in Bangkok with shirtless boys of I would guess 12-16 years old dancing for him, sitting in his lap, massaging him, etc. "
"Annnndddd just like that, you are now a courtroom witness for somebody"
"Oh shit, you will be hearing from lawyers, /u/El_Cochinote.  Good luck."
Ugh I'm so tired of these obviously made up stories for karma.
Holy shit that’s crazy
You definitely won the thread 263 days ago.
"I’ve been saying it for years privately. 

Around 9 or 10 years ago, friends of my brothers were inter railing around Europe. They happened upon Spacey in either Slovakia or Slovenia. They, of course, made a point of speaking to him as he was a familiar and well known figure 

He took them out for dinner as a group and then a few bars and a nightclub before trying to force himself upon each of them. 

They have photos of them dancing with him in said nightclub. Not a huge pile of props, but they’ve stuck to their story for 10 years, and now their story has been made look very likely. "
"Dude, the guy has like four TV shows, two of which have been on for more than fifteen years. If you space them out consecutively, it's almost forty years of material. There's no way I can catalog that shit in a timely manner."
"I got you beat. I decided what we were having for dinner and she said it was fine, and it was actually fine."
I just sat up in bed to read this. OP called it. Case closed.
"I would agree with you 100% for go go bars either gay or straight as then you have prostitution also involved which is pseudo legalized and they do everything possible to keep the cops away.  However, as I said, this was simply a nightclub. I’ve seen minors in regular nightclubs across SE Asia. Agreed also on of-age guys looking younger but I’ve been to SE Asia 50+ times including 12+ times in Thailand and I know early to mid teens when I see them. Finally, he was in a VIP room and I was only able to see because I’m 6’7” (201 CM) and could see over the door guy at his room. The only place I’ve seen brazen pedos walking down the street with boys is Cambodia and having seen it bothers me to my core to this day. "
He has if you've watched his shows and catalogued the jokes lol
Will you describe what you saw in the night club? 
I don't foresee an end to your virginity
"This is common for Thailand.  Lot's of pedos go there for this reason.  When my brother had a trip there he told me he saw more then once, older western men walking and holding hands with little thai boys.  

Have no clue how the laws for this work there.  Only know that Thailand is a go to destination for pedos."
"such a great question...

when i confronted her about it she denied it completely but i knew for a fact it was her. i literally haven’t said a word to her since then because my i don’t even know how i could express my anger and pain through a text. "
they were dropped because the judge decided if i wrote out the child pornography law 25 times it would teach me my lesson 
Do you honestly think the authorities don't already know?
"If you could go back in time and catch the person that went through your phone, how would you murder her? "

"Alright, so you can mope around or get your feet back under you? Whats your plan OP? You gonna get your life together or am i gonna see your suicide AMA in 3 months? Its never too late to stop what you hate seeing yourself do. No one is expecting your isolated effort. Reach out if you need help, if you think you dont need help then see you in 3 months. "
"The Hispanic culture is very much intertwined here. In Los Angeles the communities were very much divided by ethnic and cultural lines (Armenians live in Glendale, blacks in south LA, Hispanics in the valley) and no one really interacted with the other's culture. Here my Hispanic friends know country music, and my white friends pronounce spanish words and know more about Hispanic culture than I do, and I was raised 2.5 hours from the border.

Also: Texans aren't ""americans,"" they are Texans, and very proud of it. "
not a competition we are on the same team!!!
And I do not see an end to your savagery
My closest family and friends believed me when I said I was innocent. They never abandoned me.
Why wait until 2019? Maybe now's the time to PM him to let him know.
"&lt;pedantry&gt;

As of today, there have been 294 episodes of Family guy. At 22 mins an episode, you could watch them all in 107.4 hours. So that one is less than a week worth of material.   

If all 4 show were as prolific as FG (they aren't) it would take about a month to watch them all if you sleep 8 hours a night, and spend 1hr a day eating. 

If you had to work, it would take 2-3 months.  

If you were to split the work up among 4 people, that's only 3 weeks of casual TV watching for each of them.  

Not nearly as impossible as you made it out to be.  

&lt;/pedantry&gt;"
"It was a regular nightclub in Thailand. Actually one of the most popular ones at that time. Upper balcony had VIP rooms and that’s where he was. For those who know most of SE Asia, age restrictions aren’t strictly enforced especially for a VIP with cash. I didn’t see teens out in the rest of the crowd but definitely in his room."
"""I don't know what that is. So I think yes"""
Some don’t. There are levels to corruption and they can be circumvented 
Twist: That was Kevin Spacey's alt account.
I wish him constipation until the end of his days.
cried the whole time i wrote them out and when I got to court the judge didn’t even look at them before throwing them away. 
Um this is the opposite of what he was saying. 
"No, I did not"
"Imo the same thing that keeps you from not offending against whoever you're attracted to. It fucking sucks ass being a pedophile, and I wish to hell I wasn't one, but I'm not a rapist, just like you (I assume) aren't one either. I love kids, unfortunately in a sexual way, but in an emotional way too, and in real life just like you the thought of offending against someone just for sexual gratification isn't something that crosses my mind."
"On the bright side, you're only 23. Most people get addicted to gambling later in life and lose everything they've worked for. 
"
"I've been to Thailand, and know a guy who owned a gay go-go bar there too.  It's my understanding that a nightclub in Bangkok would never take the risk of underage boys.  Many of-age Thai guys look young.  Children can be procured, but it's very, very discreet.

FWIW, I'm straight and not a pedophile."
"""Because they dont get what they want"""
i appreciate this...i see the judges re-election signs everywhere and i just think about him talking about my nipples lmao 
You can ask anything. Nowhere does it say he has to answer everything.
"""I would.... I would drive a car into... And then pass the big big butt"""
"Cambodia is more the go-to place for pedophilia.  You really never see it out in open in Thailand.  Young Thai guys, yes, but not underage. "
"The Philippines is similar. I've heard horrifying things, there was a television special in which a reporter went undercover as someone who was interested in paying a woman for the services of her under age daughter. And when I say underage I mean seriously young. It made my blood boil, I just want to kill everyone that enables this horrific abuse. These children are just tools for sick gratification :("
"""I would just..... get hot sauce and squirt it in their face"""
Did you do it?
"My law school has a class whose final project is to defend gun rights. So... that for SURE would never happen in LA.

Also I saw more deer dead on the side of the road on the way here than I ever have in my entire life put together.

Finally... armadillos are real and wild."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/41qlsw/what_celebrity_have_you_met_who_turned_out_to_be/

I deleted this thread but I never forgot. I apologize for not believing. This was almost two years ago."
"Noodle,

Does your bonsai tree pot sass you?"
"Not a dumb question.

Let's say you are in a club in Thailand and attempt to take a pic like that... you could end up in the dumpster.

Many don't realize that taking pictures in night clubs is a VERY recent thing. 20 years ago taking a picture in a club could yield getting punched out. The world changed a LOT in 20 years. That said, it doesn't mean nowadays taking pics in a club/bar is cool world-wide."
5 year old is smarter than the president 
2D taught me. Don't read anything into that by the way. It wasn't the horizontal mambo. 
"""Punching her in the butt"""
And now you’re on a list.
Unsunscribe flyfacts
"""No. Because that would be bad and I would get arrested forever."""
"so basically, you're not allowed to look at yourself.  WTF?

did they confiscate your (full body) mirror too?"
"""Get cool by practicing. Practicing! Practicing! Practicing!"""
I really respect you man. Don't kill yourself. Find something to do
OP has been missing for 1h 27m... AMA
"I miss LA a lot, really busy everyday of the week and always something to see. But here it’s very laid back, people really are much nicer and more genuine in the south. I’m thinking about staying here after school.

On the way driving out here, I stopped at a gas station in a small town and the cashier genuinely was asking about my day and how my trip was going. Weird feeling, to have someone care about your day haha"
"""Because we're people"""
Ramen
"Also, the Dementors."
I got money as a form of compensation. My criminal record is clear but I had to move because everyone in my city knew what happened and I wanted to start sort of new life.
His character in the season 5 trailer literally mentions treating his fellow man like children and giving them sticky candy....makes the show weirder.
Burglary and 5 murders
"I'm texting my friend now, he seems to agree with you.

Coincidentally, I'm leaving for Taiwan, Cambodia, and Thailand on the 30th."
"""E"""
i just said that i think about him talking about my naked body not that i want to take him down...chill 
Were the charges eventually dropped? 
"Noodle: Ryōan-ji, a Zen temple in Kyoto. Every day, under the cherry trees, the abbot rakes little pebbles into lines. It shows the mystery of life. Something we are not meant to understand, but that we should try to contemplate. Much like the enduring mystery of Murdoc's sex appeal. "
Noodle: I've got lots of tips - being on tour with these guys can be a special kind of hell. So I like to take some time out for myself and study astrophysics. Practise hand to hand combat. And troll anyone on Instagram who posts pictures of food they eat. 
"""Golden gate bridge"""
My gun was used in the crime. There were only my fingerprints on it.
"I , spy, a phenomenal new YouTube channel!"
"""Soldiers because they have guns""

(Yikes!)"
"""No. Actually....... no. But I've stomped a girl flat."""
Noodle: Thank you. I think working with Grace Jones was incredibly inspiring. Anybody who can do handstands and discuss philosophy and own her sexuality is good by me. And my advice is always to believe in yourself. Be confident and try different things and don't ever let yourself feel small. 
That's almost 10 life times to the common housefly.
Noodle: That depends. Is Murdoc still in it? 
"""What is hobby"""
"Wow. 

Describe how he could get those services at this club.

Were you with a group? Alone? Did others at the club witness him there? Seems like a public place for this type of behavior."
"Did anyone abandon you? If so, are they back now that it has been overturned? "
This needs more upvotes.
"Yes, Thailand has so much child prostitution only because nobody reported it yet. That's exactly how the world works. "
"Noodle: Not many people know this, but Millie Bobby Brown and I are actually BFF's. We both like to send each other pictures of cats we see on the street on our travels. I haven't seen any of season 2 yet though - saving that to binge watch on tour while Murdoc parties with whatever reprobates he brings back to the bus. "
Who does an AMA then doesn’t answer a single question?? An asshole that’s who!
"You’re literally in a conversation about a false conviction, and are defending capital punishment?? "
Noodle: YAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS
Holy shit.
Did any of the wait staff seem disturbed by any of this? How do you serve a drink to a dude with a boner getting massaged by a 12-year-old? 
I'm sure I'm on several.
You are on my list of anonymous internet people to fondly think about from time to time and wish safe travels upon. Have a good time in Asia you monster. 
"Keep going, it’s worth it. I got shit from other guys when I was 11 or 12, and it definitely made me want to quit, but 5 years later, the same guys that mocked me are jealous of me. Ballet is not a “girls” thing. Boys are heroes in the world of dance. It’s tough at first, but other guys will realize soon that while they’re playing football, wresting around with sweaty boys, you’re hanging out with beautiful girls and creating art with people who will become your best friends"
One of my best friends is a registered sex offender because when he was 15 he had sex with his 15 year old girlfriend and her parents found out.  It’s fucked with many aspects of his adult life. 
"""Oh, no. I haven't seen him before. It's a fox."""
Simz: cartoon. for sure.
Are people born cool or do the get cool by practicing?
They would even feel kinda sorry for me I believe. I ddidn't want that. I want to be a normal citizen like everyone else.
"Sadly, there are plenty of teens who get charged and convicted of these things and left to spend their entire lives on a list with actual offenders."
"""Having cops"""
"It wasn't good for me. I mean, prison is prison - small rooms, smelly etc. For me the main problem was that people where laughing at me because i kept claiming I was innocent and noone believed me."
Update: he's watching a movie now and is getting pissed I'm asking him so many questions. Will continue later :)
Please be careful. Unusual physical details (your height) may be identifying! Please protect yourself!
Noodle: I am serving Lucy Liu from Kill Bill vol. 1 meets Eleven from the climax of Stranger Things season 1 meets anyone who snatches their rival's weave during Drag Race and you'd better know it
"they’re my damn boobs!!! 

i don’t think the judge would have liked that defense though. "
Simz: Dirty Harry. Clint Eastwood. Kids With Gunz
... Is it too late to watch House of Cards?
Everyone laughed at me because i kept claiming i was innocent. I didn't pay attention to that. Didn't speak to these guys nor anything. That was a right thing to do. That's pretty much the only advice i can give you. Don't get provoked or don't do stupid things when provoked either in prison or outside.
"A friend of mine lost his virginity to a female WoW player, which he met playing WoW and who was also a virgin. They we’re 32 when they met. He has a shot. "
Are you gonna answer anyone?
"Looks like OP got this one right. Thanks for sharing.

Man, that is one sick demented motherfucker."
"Simz: it was actually the bands idea, and I'd love to do a studio version. Maybe we can make that happen.."
"someone i had been friends with took me to one of his friend's houses. i had never met that friend of his before, as he was a new friend of his. ended up not being allowed to leave the house and the rest went from there."
"""Right now"""
"""Ask me anything"" means anything? You won't even reveal the continent?"
Noodle and Simz: we both like the colour green! 
My family's and friend's suffering because they knew I was innocent.
"I'm neither a lawyer or a cop, but I suspect that even if OP did, it would come down to what could be proven... and from what I gather, the photos were sent from the OPs phone.

Unless the other person said on the record that they were responsible for sending the photos out from OPs phone, there's no choice but to go after the owner of the device from which the images were sent because they can prove they were sent from that device and it was (more or less--it was in the same place the owner was, at least) in the owner's possession at the time."
"""I'll give you a clue. It has red fur and canines."""
"I wasn’t born yet. It happened two years before I was born when she was 3. When my dad got out of the Marines he got my sisters mom pregnant and then married her - from what I understand they were together for a couple of years. My dad tells me he left her because she started doing witchcraft and that in the separation thing became violent towards each other. 

The rest of this story is very sensitive and taboo in my family - I have had to gather information about the details of what happened next from many different people who were around at that time. I’ve been told similar versions of the same story my entire life - this is the most consistent / short version of everything I’ve been able to learn. 

In the separation my dad was accused of molesting his daughter by the mother in retaliation for the breakup. In court my dad was pushed into signing a plea bargain in order to ever have child molester erased from his record. It was not made clear to him that in signing this all rights would be waived to his daughter as a condition. After he signed the plea and was sentenced the mother of his child was allowed to change their daughters identity and disappear. The catch is that she had a history of doing this : she accused her first baby daddy of the same thing when they split up and disappeared with his daughter too. "
"You can pay anyone off for anything pretty much anywhere if you have enough cash. But especially in countries like Thailand, and SE Asia in general. And more so if you're a Western celebrity! It's really nmot hard to believe at all, unfortunately. 
"
"I found out at 16 that the man who raised me wasn’t my biological father. Which meant that the 5 older step siblings I had weren’t related to me at all. 

That next summer I met my biological father. He has another daughter that is a few years older than me, but I didn’t meet her until several years later. It’s crazy how much alike we are. 

I always knew things didn’t quite fit with my family, and when I met my biological sister it was like I met the missing piece of my puzzle. We talked the same, laughed at the same stupid shit, we even named one of our kids the same thing despite not meeting each other or talking all those years. "
"Noodle,

What Gorillaz song means the most to you? Be it emotionally, just because you enjoyed working on it, or any other reason?"
what did she pick?!
"It wasn't fine. And you'll understand in a few weeks/months when this ""fine"" comes up again."
still better politics than trump
"Dont worry bud, keep looking "
"Absolutely. As a white male I was openly hated in Los Angeles whenever I went out of my neighborhood. As I said in a previous comment, LA is very divided ethnically, with literally neighborhood blocks being different races. Texas is not at all that way (from what I’ve seen) and people are very integrated. Everyone is very open to different cultures and very kind and accepting as a whole. 

Which honestly is completely backwards from the stereotypes but there ya go"
"That really is an underrated thing about Texas. I just moved there from Chicago and whites and black people are far more culturally integrated in Texas as well. You can't drive through one part of a city and see the stark segregated line drawn the way you can in Chicago. 

I would say all races here are much more conservative, but at least the races interact and seem to get along okay."
Simz: cats over dogs. I feel like dogs are bit unpredictable. cats are chill. me and noodle's cat get on really well
