I don't believe you.
Feed your Nibblonian well.
"I am the most athiest person I know.

I do not want ANYONE to hit me with any religious bullshit on this AMA. "
"Not a question, but I think what you are doing is very admirable. I imagine you would be hard pressed to find many 24 year old's willing to make that kind of commitment.  "
"Bagels, because they're empty inside, just like me :)

Nah. Cheese, probably. But I am pretty empty inside, so I got that going for me."
How does it feel to be a meme from 2012?
took a Rick and Morty reference and flipped it to a Futurama reference. Well played.
"How do you make concentrated dark matter?
"
"My guess would be that you actually prefer being on your own, but media has convinced you that you need to be in a relationship. That or you just haven't found the right one. It's certainly an unfair conundrum."
"It happened during my senior year 3 months before graduation so my graduation ceremony didn't carry that normal exciting happy feeling it normally did. 

One weird thing for me going back was that it happened on a Monday, and I believe they opened it back up on a Wednesday or Thursday for us to go back and gather our things. And this seems very insignificant, but when I got home, i realized I was missing a piece of jewelry that I must have lost in all the commotion. When I was able to go back, that piece of jewelry was sitting ever so perfectly still in my classroom seat. My dad ended up making it into a memorial piece for me. "
What kind of money are you bringing in? Tips vs hourly/salary? 
Are you using USB type C? Because that would be cheating
"No question here but id just like to say you're a pretty baller of a sister, he's gonna love you till the end for sure.  
That's dope."
I swear it was almost like magic!
They should stop. 
"I want people to read this comment more than any others : 
A lot of people (Especially other Christians) love to mock JWs and make up some bull-shit rumors about how we donate every penny of our salary, but this is not true.
The time and money we spend for the church is totally voluntary (although preaching outside is highly recommended). All the elders and other position holders do not get paid a cent for preparing their weekly sermons.
You can mock JWs all you want about their beliefs, but not with money. 
Thank you for a great question."
Because school bullies haven't yet destroyed all their hope.
Do you fuck with the war?
Double dick dude had proof.  Where's yours?
Exhausted from carrying around my enormous ego

DID YOU JUST ASSUME YOUR OWN GENDER
"I am decently okay now. And I did not see, but I heard much of the events. The shooting took place in our cafeteria and I was in the classroom directly to the left of it. So I heard most shots and the screams of course "

As someone who went to Chardon - and was there - it's really strange and jarring to be scrolling through reddit and see this...
"I think so. 

She realized that she was forgetting a lot of what happened. Like she wouldn't remember a few days or a week and she started freaking out about it. Then her therapist said she might be dissociating. We started using a journal to talk to each other and thats when she knew."
Thank you my dude 
"Doesn't work. And even if it did, all I really want is a decent conversation. Can't manipulate people for that. It comes naturally to people, people who aren't in my situation."
"I wish I had a grand excuse like I read so and so and figured it out. But it is much simpler than that.

I didn't get what I wanted. Let me elaborate. After growing up in religion and doing everything I'm told and still had a crummy life. I came to the conclusion that if God (Allah) doesn't care about me, therefore, I won't care about him.

That indifference evolved into a search of other creeds and beliefs and eventually, the lack of belief in God and making the transition into being an Athiest along with reading and educating myself about the world and cultures and such. 

I hope that is clear to you. I can elaborate further if you wish."
Thank you for answering my question :).
"In the middle of sex and I was just like ""um nevermind bye""."
"Fake being kidnapped and send a ransom video asking for a diamond ring. In the video, while tied up, tell your gf where there's a ring hidden inside your house, tell her it's in the closet. When she goes to open the closet, she finds you with the ring, kneeling on one knee."
"Bucket lists are overrated.

To me, bucket lists are always forced. Most people take life as it comes, so why should I attempt to fit every experience possible into the short time I have left?

I'm living like anyone else would. As normal as it can be, anyway. I do what everyone else does. I take each day as it comes.

If there's anything I did want to do, though, it was to feel ultimately free. That's always been a thing of mine, as even away from the illness, my life has been a horrible shitshow. I've always liked the idea of running away. Standing on the edge of a cliff ledge somewhere. Feeling immortal, somehow.

I still do get that sometimes.

Though I'm far from immortal.

So, to answer your question, no. I don't have a bucket list. I know what I want from life, ideally, but they're all things I can't achieve. And I've accepted that.

But I feel as if this was a life lived. Not well-lived. Not particularly poorly-lived. Not mediocrely-lived.

Just, lived. "
3 killed total.  3 additional injured I believe.  Not including the emotionally injured of course 
Choking on a car seems pretty intense.
What’s your favorite food? And will you eat it as much as possible in the next year?
I'm consistent 
Currently at 10. 6 that were dropped from planes and 4 mines. 
"There isn't really anything.

Feel free."
you hear OP they're a witch! *grabs torch*
"Yes. It is. I live in a small, relatively wealthy town by the sea so obviously not like Caracas but it still sucks. Almost all the money goes into buying food and the town is locked due to protests, most of us have lost serious weight and all 
look skinny. I'm really hoping the international community helps, because neither the government nor the opposition can save this place."
Ur pretty dope 
"My wife was a stripper when she was 18 and it paid her way through college. Now she teaches special needs kids. So, keep to your goals!"
OK computer
"When. I don't fear death, so if I knew when I could at least plan my last moments around it."
"I already became the Oracle, this is just part of the job."
"One of my most vivid memories is when I finally got called to leave, my dad was running towards me as much as he could and hugging me. It was a priceless moment that sticks in my mind. "
"Nope. Hate it. Even the girls that non stop party in between shows break down. It's hard. Out walking around I don't have to be nice to creeps. At work so long as they aren't breaking rules I stay nice and like I enjoy it. Then people you know want you to come ""party"" with them just to see if you'll dance for free. Growing up my dreams always changed from Broadway, vet, but all through high school I found myself wanting to work with special needs children. "
Yeahhhhh pics or it didn't happen .
"Obligatory not me but, I heard the actor playing the new clown (twopenny?) in IT really scared the shit out of kids off stage.     
He wasn’t trying to be specifically scary to them I don't think, but even with the cameras off and they were chilling in a room full of adults ready to film this fake monster, they were still terrified of him. "
Typical child rapist and murder charges. They're not common but when they come up it's not nice to see :(
Why do I constantly long for a relationship but at soon as I'm in one I miss being on my own and eventually shut that person out of my life?
"indian! kidding. hm, we watch a lot of netflix. not a movie, but we loved stranger things. "
"Uh, How old are you now? 

This is a disturbing comment on so many levels. The biggest being not forming complete sentences and paragraphs."
What's your favourite Radiohead album?
Do you get this excited when you make it into your girlfriend on the first try too?
"I don't think it's as horrible as people make it out to be. 

Well... I guess it's different for me because I'm an alter and I've kind of always been aware of being an alter. Morgan wasn't aware of us until she was in high school. "
thanks! it's honestly been great. dylan is wonderful
You spend too much time browsing Reddit.
"Not personally, but knew of the family. Cousin to the shooter died of a heroin addiction not even a year after the shooting. Kind of a problem family in general. "
Why this AMA? Is it a life quest to become the Oracle?
Are you ever tempted to use sympathy from people to get stuff?
"I have gotten close to many people.  My best experience was probably with Matt Damon.  I first met him when he was up for the Oscar for Good Will Hunting in 1999.  He was always a good guy.  In 2010, I worked on a film with him and he was one of the funniest, classiest, most down to earth people I ever encountered or worked with.  A great guy.  He would come over to where we were at and make faces in the window trying to crack us up and he often invited the crew out to dinner sometimes on his own dime.  Best guy in Hollywood in my opinion!"
"Not particularly. However, one of the victims was in multiple of my classes. So it was just weird to have that empty seat every single day following. "
"I didn't really have an opinion before as I was only 17 at the time. 

Now, I think there should be stricter gun laws, education on gun safety, and more access to mental health care. There's far too many guns not in safes in America, and far too many healthcare problems to address "
Have you found any bombs?
"Just pay definitely. It makes life very hard at work and home. You don't brag about your job, you sometimes even have to lie. Imagine showing up and there is a creep and his buddies and they all smell, they're drunk, trying to touch you in places they aren't supposed to, and you have to act like you're having fun. When we see other girls leave for shows we always tell them to have a good show or make that money.  Because telling someone to have fun is almost mockery because you know they aren't going to. "
A girl.
Do you believe in the afterlife?
I've always been so fascinated by this although I'm sure it's fairly difficult to live with. Have you always been aware of your personalities? If not when did you first become aware? 
"Your sisters are terrible caregivers if they are enabling you to continue to be this unhappy.  Not trying to sound like a dick, but you need someone who wants to help you, not just continue to help you on a downward spiral.

You don't need a ""diet"".  You need a lifestyle change.  Best advice I can give is to eat real food.  Get rid of the processed food from your diet.  More importantly, you need to go see a Dr,  probably a couple different ones for the problems you have.  I'm sure you could find some to do house calls.  It's up to you and it is possible.  One day at a time. "
"No. She doesn't really care anymore. I don't think she knows. 

Justin kind of controls everything now. He's the one who did the last ama. He doesn't mind as long as I am careful about protecting our identity. "
"Will you still answer when when I ask questions 1, 5, and 10 years from now? 

Spoiler alert. I already set reminders. "
No. Regrets are for mortals.
Yes
Were you an actual witness to the event or simply at the school when it occurred?  Traumatic of course either way. Hope you are doing better now.

"No problem,  I'm just giving you a hard time. 

Listen, you're young and have your entire life ahead of you. 
Don't sweat the bullshit. 

Being a teenager is pretty tough sometimes, but you have so much ahead of you. Be smart and don't get so overwhelmed with the petty stuff, things will work out for you. "
Why would I ask you something?
"It depends. Only Hailey can play the flute. 

Most stuff is kind of shared. "
Nah
"I remember you from your last AMA.  Glad to hear you are still with us!

Did you ever get around to talking to the ""Make-a-wish folks?  I know you were considering the Star Wars premiere.

Are you able to stay at home or are you stuck in a hospital/hospice?"
Were you forced out to go out and evangelise (knock on people's doors). Did you have to ' donate' part of your salary to the organisation each month?
That is a scary number of calories.  How do you afford that?
Lawyer here - I had the same concern as OP.  I recommend at least consulting with an attorney even if you don't end up hiring one.  You should know the laws of your state.
"If there is more than 4 people for every girl yes we have someone there. So long as they follow that my driver stays in the car. Scary situations come up at pretty much every show. If I am at a 1 on 1 and I get a bad vibe I keep my phone within arm's reach at all times. Sometimes girlfriends or wives will come home. But the most frequent is guys wanting to fuck. Sometimes that's all they say for how ever long you're there. You can tell when they start to get too turned on and basically find an excuse to walk away so he can calm down a bit. Another thing is that for some God awful reason they like to pick us up. All of a sudden I have lost a lot of the control I was maintaining. We can be dropped, carried off, whatever but no we don't like it. I've had guys try and just start getting naked, start break rules, get on top of me. There has never been a single show where I haven't been in some type of danger. "
Bi what? Bilingual? Billionaire?
"Not at all. It is a crime to insult or ridicule Islam or any Islamic figures. Although it is not bad as some countries where death or physical punishment can take place. But where I am, it can lead to imprisonment, being socially outcast, losing your family (as they would forcefully divorce you from your spouse) and losing your job.

I'm not sure how many atheists there are. But I can tell you this. There are a lot of lapse Muslims. (Think lapse Catholics). They don't regulary pray or do the other commandments. But the region is going through a religious revival of some sorts. Mosques are getting fuller. More money and political power is going to legal and illegal Islamist parties. So I think we are on the brink. It can swing left or right very quickly."
"Previously, the answer to all things and discussions. Not a problem in the world that can't be solved by Islam.

Now, I look at the example of Europe. Europe through its history managed to relegate Christianity to a culture rather than an all commanding religious-political system. The reforms, the schisms, the wars all contributed to that. Even in the height of the French revolution, The Parisians did not tear down Notre Dame, they just killed the clergy or chased them out.

For the Middle East and the Muslim world to join other civilizations and the times, it must therefore relegate Islam to a cultural heritage and become humanist/secular."
Yeah it was a bad movie. It wasn't realistic at all. I thought it was stupid.
Because you're as bored as I am
How did it affect the school? How surreal was it to go back to school in the following days/months?
"I don't have much of either.

And I kind of just sit around. Can't do much on account of my illness, which is shitty. And as for the place I want to go, my prior AMA might prove more helpful."

Do you contemplate killing yourself?

"No, fuck you."
"No I did not :C 
My first birthday party was with my very first girl friend and this was after I left the religion. People get sick of birthdays eventually in their lives, but I can not express how happy I was to be a special guy for one day. "
"I live in the Middle East. 

As for Sharia. You must consider this. Islam is 1400 years old. I always like to compare with Christianity in Europe. So what was the Pope doing in the year 1400-1500? He was more or less ruling Europe.

Islam isn't any different. It's a religion which makes it mandotary to part of the state. In fact, secularism is often considered a ""great evil that mustn't be allowed in society"". Sharia IS that marriage of Mosque and State. To reject it, is to reject Islam. Now Sharia is divided. Sunni and Shiite. Among many differences between the two, the legislation also differs. For example, Pleasure marriages. This is a concept where a man can marry a woman legally for a set amout of time. As you can imagine, it's a legal cover for prostitution. One marries a woman for three days for a set amount and then the marriage contract is nullified. Although legal in early Islam, Sunni schools of thought had made illegal whereas Shiites still practice it. Therefore, a country like Iran, still allows this practice under full legal protection. But you must know this. Almost all Arab countries state in their constitution that Islamic Sharia is the only source of all authority and legislation. Some countries apply it hard, others are more relaxed about it. But it is there and it can be invoked any time.

The women question is complicated. Both sides can be found in legal history. Some liberal leaning Muslims will claim that Islam gave women their rights and such. More conservative elements will deny women the right to go out without a legal guardian. Patriarchy in society plays a major role. 

But there are facts that no honest Muslim can deny. 
1. Hijab is very vague subject. The supposed verse in the Quran that demands it isn't very clear. It states that the wives of the prophet should cover their cleveges. That is it. Flimsy, right? So both sides can expand on that as they wish.
2. Women are counted as half a man in legal proceedings such as being a witness or inheritence. None can deny that. The official reason is that women can't be trusted with testimony and they don't need as much money or property since their husbands will take care of them.
3. The Quran clearly states in the infamous 4:34 that Men are in charge of women. It is also the verse that allows men to beat their wives if they disobey. Many apologists like to twist it around. But the language is clear and the Tafsir (Official interpertations of the Quran by scholars in the formative years) makes it clear as well. 

I apologize for the long post but I hope I answered as much I as I can."
Id rather eat paint
Mostly everybody just picked a name. Some of us changed names a bunch of times. I don't think having a name changes anything. We're not like magical creatures. Giving us a name doesn't give us more power xD
When will then be now?

I'm fascinated by you and everyone else buying this bullshit. 
I think theres like 10 of us. I get along with most people.
"Personally I have not. We aren't club girls, we go to people's homes or hotels or parties. So most people don't have pole in their house but we have one back at the office. I've gotten some pretty nasty bruises from the pole though. "
"8, I have a slight preference towards women."
"Last time there was a double donged AMA, the guy had photographic proof. I know it's a tough thing to ask someone to do, but I'm not sure we would believe you have this condition without said photos. Believe me, there's no way in hell I'd post picks of my bits online, so it's not exactly fair to ask you to do it. But at the same time, I'm not going online talking in detail about my genitals. "
until college
"Me personally, no, thank goodness. But I've had many friends and employees get robbed. At least four people I've worked with got held up at gun point. One person I know was lured up to a vacant house, hit over the head with a hammer, robbed and left. A few months later he started having seizures and got into a really bad car accident because of it. He can no longer drive. He's 21 with a baby girl. 

Delivery drivers carry less than $20, it's a mistake to rob them."
"Good, fuck crabs."
"I do own a wig made of synthetic fibres. Unfortunately, this means that under heat that the wig can melt meaning I can't wear it at work due to working over a grill, and a dishwasher, nor out to a bar because sometimes they have those tall heaters for outdoor use. A real hair wig can cost upwards of $1000 AU so it's pretty damn expensive. So, I tend to go without! "
Ah I'm trying haha
Someplace in England.
"I had to go to these quite exclusive western joints to get the banned substances. (Pork or alcohol and such).

At first the waiters were confused that local fellow was asking for bacon. They explained to me, politely, that bacon contains pork and I nodded and said ""I want some!""

Delicious. Goes incredibly well with everything I reckon. Must be had with a cold American beer."
Very bored
Can I ask you a question?
"We can't drive because it's not safe but we've had a couple different jobs and now e have a job where we work from home so it's not hard. I think our life is pretty normal except for not being able to drive.

I think we switch like 2 - 10 times a day."
"Ain't a real question, but if you do love me I'm sorry but I only see you as a friend."
"I mean, you could, but it'll probably end on the hands of the government unless you bring it yourself. The best way you can help is by informing everyone you can and raising awareness."
"Lol.  Even assuming you make $150,000 and pay no state income tax, I find this extremely hard to believe.  Over 1.5 years, you'd make $225,000 in income, minus $67,000 in federal taxes, minus $133,000 student loan debt, minus the $35,000 you've saved in your retirement accounts, which would leave you about -$10,000 for all your other expenses, including your 3 vacations.  Can you provide a rough breakdown of how you did this?  Actually curious, because it doesn't seem to add up.
