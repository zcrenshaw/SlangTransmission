"With the ultra wealthy families, 100%. The kids were quite blunt in asking me how much money I had, how much I made, things like that. They probably repeated dozens of times that they had gone out and picked new bed sheets for me when I moved in, as if it was some huge sacrifice on their part but they just had to because I probably couldn't afford it. They would also go over with me how much their grandfather gave them each week (it was such a huge sum of money, I don't even think it was legal), and would immediately follow up with, ""So how much did my mom throw you this week?""

The wealthier families never compensated for anything, except sometimes my train ride back into the city on my weekends off. Now that I'm with more of an upper-middle-class family, I can see how extremely wrong that was. My current family insists on paying for absolutely everything, gives me their passwords to order food online, offers to give me cash before we go out. I would never feel  comfortable mentioning reimbursements to the past wealthier families."

Easiest way I've seen a memory leak happen is when I was back in Highschool at a Fourth of July party in junior year and my boy Jordan tried to jump into the pool from the roof. He ended up hitting his head on the pavement. Jordan had a hard time remembering things after that.

"I purchased from a licensed dealer at a gun show. I filled out a form that asks basic questions about criminal history, citizenship, etc. the seller didn’t encourage or explicitly discourage me to read the form. He said, “check these boxes. If you check those ones I can’t sell it to you. Put your social security number here and sign at the bottom.” He ran an NICS background check, wrote out a receipt and I was done. From the point of choosing the gun to taking it out the door it maybe took 20 minutes."

"Exhaust manifolds are used to keep exhaust from the muffler in an outward flow, while headers  intake the exhaust. Duh."
"I love this question! It's very relevant to the family that I worked for as a live-in employee.

The wife definitely ran the show in this household, and I've heard the same about other families in the area from my fellow nannies. I think the general belief is that, the more wealthy a family is, the more the wife calls the shots. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, in the situation I was in, it just made for a very strange power play like I've never seen before.

Basically, this woman totally emasculated her husband. This guy was like her bitch. She would sit at the head of the table every night, except for his birthday, because it was ""his special big boy day."" She would pick out all his clothes, dictate exactly what he ate, chose where he sat on the couch. She was coaching him on weight loss because she wanted him to lose a couple pounds. She demanded that he paint their bedroom walls, rather than hire a painter, and once it was all finished, she changed her mind about the color. So, he repainted it. 7 FREAKING TIMES. 7.

I'm 99% sure he was cheating on her on the side. Whenever she had to go out of town, he would call me midday to let me know he'd be back home at about four in the morning. Around the holidays, his usually steady schedule (about 7am to 3-4pm) magically got switched around so he had to work from 8pm to 5am. Crazy thing is, I think she bought these lies!"
"Let’s see how quickly we can get you to violate your NDA.  Are you black, white or Hispanic?"
It worked that way when I studied in the Southern Hemisphere. Magnets must work differently in the north
"You better update this when the NDA is lifted, I'm dying to know the answer!"
"Oh boy, I was looking forward to answering this one... Haha.

There are nanny agencies who specialize in pairing nannies with families; oftentimes, ultra wealthy and high profile families go through these agencies. The agency screens and interviews potential nannies, matches a nanny to a family, and usually helps with the contracts and agreements between nanny and family.You don't even know what family you'll be interviewing for and/or working for when you apply to the agency.

But where did I find my first job with the super wealthy? Craigslist. These people were on flipping Craigslist. This is NOT the norm, and probably should have been a warning sign when it came to how much they wanted to pay me.

Usually, you would go through an agency and be paired up with a wealthy family. You go on care.com for your typical middle class family. You go on craiglist to babysit from your home for $5/hr. I find a job with one of the wealthiest families in America on.... CRAIGSLIST."
"I did notice some differences in attitude between the top 1% and the upper middle class families that I've worked for. Most notably, at least with the extremely wealthy families that I worked for, they made it very clear to me that they expected me to work my butt off for them. While other families have been more generous in terms of giving me a break, offering to take the kids for an hour so I can have some down time, the wealthier families would complain at any ""break"" they thought they saw me taking. They were also very negative when it came to past house managers and nannies, claiming that their past workers ""did nothing,"" were ""lazy,"" and that they were paid too much for the work they did.

In terms of their attitude on money, they were very selective about what they paid for. Drop a couple thousand on plane tickets to the Bahamas for themselves? Sure, no problem. However, when they went on those last-minute vacations (which was quite often), they would refuse to pay me those wages, insisting that I wasn't worth it. In line with that, while the middle-class families have been eager to donate old toys and books, the wealthy families would literally have a dumpster brought to their driveway and would pile up toys/books/clothes for me to throw out.

I found a lot of wealthier people to be kind of ""shells"" of people, and were often on antidepressants and a hoard of other medications. They just seemed so.... negative. At least the families that I worked for."

"Hi Michael. 
I know kids can be cruel and have a lot of ignorance but thats because a lot of people forget and don’t know how negative words can strongly affect someone. Back when I was in elementary I was called just about all the names you can think of.  I let it get to my head and I became very self conscious about everything. I’ve had teachers talk down on me, call me stupid, point me out in front of the classroom just to embarrass me. I’ve been through it and it isn’t fun. I know school can be very hard especially at a young age, but one thing I always wish I had done was speak up! If you feel a teacher is saying things that make you feel uncomfortable, or classmates are physically/verbally hurting you, talk to the principal/school councillor or even just a teacher you get along with, rather than your parents. Explain what you’ve been going through and how it makes you feel. Bullying happens too often these days and it’s not something anyone should go through. A good teacher/adult will take this seriously. But please remember, it will get better. As you get older, and go to high school, you will make new friends, have new crushes, and the people that bully you now aren’t probably going to be around you forever. It’s best to be strong and just be you. Keep sticking up for yourself and do what’s right. Don’t let ANY of the things these bully’s say get you down. I know it can be hard but you are a smart kid and you can do anything if you put your mind to it. "
BECAUSE DENNIS IS A BASTARD MAN
Theres still drama! But mostly over stupid stuff that we get over in a few seconds. Last weekend we argued on if we should watch Black Mirror or Breaking Bad. 
Thank you for sharing your story. I'm sorry about your situation.
"That's an interesting question! I really did like the kids, but they seemed to have a lot of issues that simply weren't being dealt with by the parents in charge. They were cute sometimes, made funny comments, but I felt like their parents were really messing them up.

I would consider the children very spoiled. At nine to eleven years old, they had the newest iPhones, flatscreen TVs in their rooms, walk-in closets, Monet paintings on their walls, signed photographs of Hollywood stars, all the usual. Haha. They were also able to afford any club or activity that they wanted, and I'm sure it was never explained to them that that wasn't the norm for most families. They would get treats/new clothes/online purchases almost every day, could sign up for any sport they wanted, that kind of thing. Most notably, when their grandfather came over, it was just ridiculous. I remember one night when they went out to dinner for a couple hours, and one son came back with a couple hundred dollars in cash, the other came back with a new Apple laptop, and the daughter came back with one of those massive $100+ Lego sets. 

The kids were very aware of how much they had, and loved to brag about it. They definitely spent more time going over everything that they had, counting their piggybank savings (hundreds of dollars) and toys, rather than actually going out and having fun. I don't think they had a lot of friends, probably due to this.

I also found that the kids had unusual issues with violence and eating disorders, that I haven't experienced with my middle class families. The boys would go into the bathroom and puke up their meal if they thought they ate too much. Their daughter would ask me for dieting tips at the age of nine. Oh, and I found out months into the position that the last nanny had quit on them because the eldest child had whipped her with a leather belt. That's the same child who raised a baseball bat to my face when I asked him gently to calm down.

The parents spent very little time with them. Their mother would make them breakfast and drive them to school, and would then pick them up from school and drop them off with me for the evening. We would usually have dinner together, but in silence (no speaking at the table allowed). The parents seemed very particular with how the children acted and held themselves, even when they were just sitting around watching TV."
Have you ever seen the first season (or even the first few episodes) of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt? It’s sounds just like what you experienced.
How do you feel about child labor?
"Honestly, as far as the families that I worked for went, they came across as very two-faced. I mean, I get that I saw a lot of their personal lives (I was a live-in house manager), and so they couldn't be charismatic and ""UP"" all the time. When guests left, they wanted to chill out and be themselves, and I do get that. However, it's like they went from 0 to 100 in their charisma. 

When they had a dinner party with the family, or perhaps fellow parents in the neighborhood came over for an evening, they would turn on ""host"" mode. Going around telling stories, offering wine, taking jackets, the whole nine yards. And then as soon as that door shut behind the last guest, they just went back to being pretty rude, judgmental people who yelled at their kids too often and who sat around the rest of the evening making fun of so-and-so at the party.

In terms of how they spoke to me, I would never, ever use the word charismatic to describe them. Self-centered, pushy, and passive aggressive, as far as I'm concerned."
"Sending food here is banned since the 2014 protests, either the guys a the aduana steal it or the police says you cant pass it because something maduro said in the protests. "
"Did the kids ever see you as less because you have a nanny job? I was also a nanny and the kids would always assume I was poor because I refused to buy them whatever they wanted anytime were out. Also, did the families ever compensate for things for you such as gas and if you were to make purchases while you were with kids?"
"Not at all!!!
There is many stories of tourists who were robbed or kidnapped just getting here. Its a terrible idea :/"
"Yeah, actually.

I have 3 clones and we all play Mario Kart together. Video games are more fun with other people anyways!"
"Oh, congrats! I'm happy to here it.

The first thing I recommend you do is hop on over to the nanny subreddit and ask all of those lovely ladies and gents. I do post on there under a different account, and it's a very helpful, active sub.

As your nanny is mainly there to chauffeur the children, I would definitely keep in mind that kids can trash a car pretty easily. Does she drive her own car? Or one of yours? If it's her car, keep in mind that there will be wear and tear caused by the children and it would be amazing if you offered to help pay for any upkeep of the car. I've known families who get their nanny's car totally cleaned out, vacuumed, and washed for her on a pretty regular basis! Make sure that the kids understand that there will be NO snacks or drinks (beside water) in nanny's car without her explicit permission. Lots of nannies complain about constant crumbs, juice/soda spills, muddy foot prints, crayon marks, and such due to the kids.

A couple other things I highly recommend to keep your nanny happy:

-Ask and ask often if your nanny spent anything extra that day. As I've become a more desirable sitter in the area, I have no problem cutting off families who don't reimburse me for expenses. If you want her to take the kids anywhere, offer to leave cash or Venmo before they go. If she caves in and buys the kids an ice cream (if it's okay with you as the parents), then you do need to reimburse that.

-Make sure that you always let her know if you're going to be late, and do pay her for any extra time she spends working. Even if it's only 15 minutes, that's 15 minutes of her day she gave up, and she should be paid 1/4 of her hourly wage for that.

-Please, please do not micromanage her. I had a chauffeuring job in the past where I would pick up a little girl from school, walk her home, and do homework/dinner until her parents got home. The parents expected me to text them the second that I picked her up, the second we got home, what I was making her for dinner, when she finished her homework,etc. That job did not last long, needless to say! I can't tell you how annoying that is.

Happy to answer any other questions :) Good luck!"

"I would agree with that. I remember one of the moms that I worked for would constantly use the term ""get rich quick."" ""We're not hiring that landscaper, he's looking to get rich quick."" ""I decided we're not giving strandedinalimo her 2 week paid vacation, she's not going to get rich quick around here."" They were cautious, but showed it in the wrong way I think - instead of communicating their worries effectively, they just came across as rude, self-absorbed snobs."

They had the same nanny for about 10 years, and after she finally quit on them, they bragged nonstop about leaving her bad references on all of her agency applications. 10 years and she was really that bad?

The parents, grown adults, would have screaming matches with the extended family over who was doing to get the top floor vs. bottom floor of one of their vacation homes. They screwed me over on an agreed upon 2 week paid vacation. The wife insisted that I didn't need to dust while builders were working a room, and proceeded to bring me into the room a day later so that she could go apeshit crazy about the dust the builders left. This lady also threw a fork at her son's face because he didn't like her cooking. Thy were liars, cheaters, and paid me terribly. Not nice people."

From this thread I have learned:

1) You are a black/African American actor. 

2) You are young given you mention being or having been in college recently. 

3) Your character is a well known character

4) Your character is associated with comic books but **NOT** a superhero. 

5) Your character is male. 

**So here are my questions:**
- Is Your character supernatural in any way?
- Is Your character someone that requires you to wear a costume, and/or makeup/prosthetics?
- Is Your character a good guy or bad guy?
- If I wanted to dress up as your character for Halloween, are they popular enough that I could order a costume of them online right now?

Edit: he had a pretty cool experience seeing mine too. He was stuttering over his words. It was so cute! Then he was awkwardly touching me and asking if he could touch this body part and that part,etc.


First kiss happened when we were lying in bed together. We cuddled a little bit and then out of nowhere he tried to kiss me. He missed and kissed my nose (lol) but he tried again and it was like magic. We were both inexperienced and the first kiss was sloppy and immature but it was one of the best moments in my life.

Why aren't you paying attention in class u little shit?
"If you are the sort of person who is seriously considering it of your own accord, having researched the true financial costs involved (high) and dangers (also high) - then yes! I do recommend it. I set foot in previously untouched islands with sandy beaches as white and brilliant as diamonds - I swam in crystal clear waters where the crabs would scuttle around underneath me without cause to fear because they had never seen a human before - I’ve climbed a coconut tree and used a machete to hack one down because I was genuinely exhausted from trekking and it was the easiest food source (nothing like cracking open a coconut on a scorching day) - so much more. Experiences I genuinely don’t think you’d have any other way... certainly not in the rat race. 

BUT it is damn pricey. If you’ve ever had to bridge the gap between one job ending and the other beginning with no income in between you know how quickly money disappears. Imagine that but for years on end. Also, know that it takes a long ass time to get anywhere. It took us four years to get from the south end of California to Florida, and that was without staying in any one place for longer than a fortnight (generally). It’s dangerous. As a general rule island people and other boaters are super friendly folk, but a lot of the places you go you will be clearly more well off than the locals and that makes you a target. Then there is the natural danger of the ocean, the ever present fear of capsizing or springing a leak, having the engine break down at sea or waking up to realize your anchor had dragged out to the ocean and you’re lost, or someone boating over in the middle of the night and boarding you, or running into a storm which delays your travels which means you’re caught at sea with no more fresh water to drink or food to eat. Another point, it’s really lonely. There’s no way to keep communication with the land when you’re out to sea, let alone keep up friendships and family life over the years long journey. Which brings me to my final point - I wouldn’t do it alone, but I wouldn’t do it with a family either. I and my brothers were severely impacted by growing up in an isolated environment with no peers, little social interaction, and no stable home (I mean that in the literal sense - my parents were good people!). It took me YEARS to readjust and even to this day I sometimes feel like a stranger in a strange land. I wouldn’t do that to my kid.

If after all of that you still think you want to go - I’d say do it. You’ll regret it for the rest of your life if you don’t. Anyway, who wants to do what everyone else does? I don’t want my tombstone to read “Was highly successful at being ordinary”."

I'm pretty positive that the family was in the mob. Italians in NY in the top 1%; the parents would constantly compare themselves to the Sopranos. That being said, I found by doing a quick Google search of the family's name and business, that really, the top 1% do run everything. I thought that the family ran one business, albeit it's a huge, very well-known, ultra wealthy business. Just doing a quick Google search showed me that they have ties to basically every major industry you can think of. Education? Yep, they work with the textbook companies. Health? Yep, they're in charge of a major health/nutrition service in another state. Film? Yep, they own a studio.

Thanks for the great feedback I will try but I always feel really uncomfortable speaking up but from now on I will try to use your instructions.
"I've had experience with multiple extremely wealthy families, but I will say, it was one particular family that I worked for for nearly a year that were just filthy rich. I guess most of my answers do revolve around that one situation.

I know for a fact that it's not the same across the board! I've dealt with some very kind, thoughtful individuals who were also ultra-wealthy. The major family that I worked for was definitely ""old money,"" whose money just kept on growing and whose businesses are still expanding. I've found that wealthy individuals who started from scratch do tend to be the more generous employers."
"I agree with you! This is my first family and I wish I would have known a few things to request before taking the job. For example, if a nanny is getting paid 12 an hour but isn’t being compensated for gas etc. then the nanny isn’t actually making 12 hour. Some families are aware of this and completely generous towards their nanny. Others not at all. If you are going to have someone in your home and their job is your kids then it only makes sense that they become a part of the family and should be treated as such. How was your relationship with the kids? In my experience kids act different with nannies because they know they can get away with shit. "
You’re a sweetheart ❤️ just went to a movie and now I have to go out for dinner for my father in laws birthday so I’ll get dolled up later
"I'm quite certain that I'm not you...  The last time I checked, I was still me.  Will recheck and update later. "
"""millionaire"" in quotes, so not actually a millionaire?"
Did this come about from eating too many a-spicey meatah balls?

"You know, I really try to be supportive of children, no matter how bad the behavior can be at times. Yes, the children were bratty and spoiled, but at the end of the day, who made them that way? Most of my resentment is aimed toward the parents for not teaching their children better.

That being said, there were a couple of times when I had to give them a semi-big wake up call. When their eldest son, who was probably 11 at the time, tried to smash a baseball bat into my face when I asked him to please calm down, I immediately followed it with a stern, ""If you hit me with that, I'm going to have to call the police."" He definitely had a WTF look on his face as I walked away. When they made extremely rude remarks or did something totally inappropriate, I would get a stone-cold look on my face and walk away in silence. Sometimes they asked why I was ""glum,"" sometimes they didn't care. It was definitely a test of my patience, though, that's for sure!

I find it's difficult with wealthy families, because you often feel like if you take the kids down a notch, you'll get fired on the spot. At least, that's how I felt. Now, with middle class families, I have no problem telling the kids to knock it off, cut the crap, and chill out. And the kids actually listen!"
"Not really... Sorta, kinda. I slept with a guy, chose not to pursue anything after that one night, and deleted his number. Months and months later, I applied to a nanny job, spoke to the wife and the position sounded absolutely perfect. I go in for an interview, and guess who the freaking dad is?! :/ 

No, I didn't accept the position."
"Most nurses like wine. I like weed. I never smoke before a shift, only after. That and hugging my boyfriend who is an accountant and can not relate at all lol."

What is a good personal lubricant?
So you obtained a firearm legally but did it dishonestly while filling out your form. Not cool man. 
Did you clear posting this with the people who hired you? I am concerned that your excitement may lose you this role and tarnish your reputation for future projects. 
I believe the official term is Vampire Disco.
