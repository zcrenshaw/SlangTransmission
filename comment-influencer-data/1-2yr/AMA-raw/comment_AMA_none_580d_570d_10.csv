Update: I told his mom and sent her pictures of the damage to my car and she offered to take care of the cost after she beats the shit out of him :)
Sounds like a horrible country.
"One of my favorite stories. My husband had doubled parked behind another car to run into a pizza shop. Parking and roads are just complete chaos, so double parking is the norm. 

But the guy returned to his car and wanted to back out. He starting blaring the horn and yelling pretty aggressively. I didn’t have my phone and also had my two small children in the car with me. I simply thought the best thing would to be quickly reverse our car and let the guy out and then park in his spot. 

So I do exactly this, guy actually waved and thanked me as he drove off. But I did notice a vehicle full of woman and kids watching me. The kids were freaking out pointing and laughing. A few minute goes by and suddenly I’m surrounded by black SUVS. It wasn’t even the regular police, but the secret police (like really serious stuff). My husband also happens to walk out around the same time. His face went completely white and I’ve never seen him so scared in my life. 

The cops immediately starting aggressively interrogating my husband, ask for his id and paperwork. They called him names, and demeaning him for letting his wife drive. It was really scary, but then my husband mentioned I was American. Suddenly the police completely switched gears and were super nice. The main officer finally looked in the car at me and then talked to me.  He apologized for the confusion, mentioned it was just a hot issue at the time. Asked that I please not do it again and that was it. They all left. Once we got over the shock of the situation we laughed at how absurd it was. "
"I had to wear an abaya, which is that black robe/dress the women wear. I didn’t cover my hair. I’d wear pajamas or leggings and a T-shirt underneath. 

Also in Jeddah you see a lot of colorful abayas. I had a gray one with lace accents I really liked. I also had one tailored, so it didn’t have buttons down the front and was slim fit. I had a habit of tripping over the abaya and the front would rip open. 

Once my toddler got out of the apartment while I was putting the baby down for a nap. And I frantically ran out into the streets screaming his name. I then realized I wasn’t wearing an abaya and ran back inside to grab it. It was a really fucked up moment in my head deciding to go get a piece of fabric and turn my attention away from finding my son.  "
Tell his family.
What I’m getting from this post is that Saudi Arabia sucks
That is actually a good idea thank you so much
"Let me preface this by saying I don't wanna be rude at all, but...

Why would you willingly move somewhere that turns you into a second-class citizen"
"Also, I got used to it. The high quality abayas are really light weight and don’t feel too hot. And actually sometimes wish I could get away with wearing one now, because it’s so easy to throw it on over pajamas and look presentable. 

But it’s horrible to be forced on women though. "
This is so unsettling to me as a new father. I can’t imagine the horror of putting my wardrobe before the safety of my child. 
It was very unsettling to me as well. It’s something that pisses me off.
"I think the respect for elders/parents is admirable. Also, it is a very family oriented society. 

Also, the “it takes a village to raise a child” mentality was refreshing. Other women would come over and help me when I was trying to wrangle a toddler and keep an eye on my stroller at the same time. They’d offer to hold my Infant or give my kid a snack. People were really laid back about kids being kids too."
"That's great news! Keep in mind he is doing this for a variety of reasons, one of which is to get your attention. Do not respond to him directly unless absolutely necessary . I'm sorry you're going through this but glad his mom seems to be recognizing the gravity of his actions :)"
"Because I love and trust my husband. 

I knew when marrying him this was a possibility. 

Also depending on the family, women live very different lives. All my sister in laws are college educated; One works full time and one owns a small business. They have pretty normal lives."
Saudi Arabia is more or less ISIS if they succeeded in their mission. Theocracies are horrible places. 
"Yeah. I never wore hijab, just the abaya.  I also felt I was treated with more respect in shops and at restaurants, like I was in some higher class by just being an American. It was strange. 

"
What was your everyday “dress code” like? Was it hard to adjust to? How often did you unknowingly break a rule/not realize until afterwards?
"Being able to finally meet all my husband’s family was the best part. I also just loved being in such a different country, seeing so many new things. I got used to the European products in grocery stores and the UK music channels on the tv. 

I attended a wedding and that was lots of fun. 

Least favorite, it was at times incredibly boring.  But I also had two small kids so I didn’t get out much. But besides malls and eating out, there’s not too much to do. "
What happened when you were caught driving?
You didn't already know that? 
"We had been married for 4 years at the time. I also have many saudi women friends as well. I was very aware of the culture and laws. 

One thing that was a bit concerning was going to a country where I really had to put complete trust in my husband to treat me right. I realized I was losing many rights I had as a woman. I didn’t really prepare too much. 

I wasn’t prepared to see such wealth disparity, like seeing children begging in the streets, seeing how horrible people treat animals, and the million  feral street cats, and the rampant racism especially towards the low level immigrant workers. "
"Like trash. 

Get a cute kitten. (By the way I saw the most beautiful Persian cats in the world in Saudi) No longer want the kitten that is now a cat. Just drop it off somewhere, or kick it outside. 

It’s even worse for dogs. Saw kids throwing stones at them. 

There’s no animal abuse laws, or it’s not enforced if there are any. Pet stores have tiny cages filled with animals. Animals look sickly and just in poor shape. 

Which is crazy to me, because Islam has a lot to say about showing animals compassion and how to treat them. But then again Saudi isn’t a very good representation of Islam. "
Do you have proof of either?  That's defamation/harassment and destruction of property.
"No, I did believe in God at the time. And Muslim men are allowed to marry women from the other Abrahamic religions. 

I had met my husband at a time I was actively looking into other religions. I was raised Christian but had a hard time accepting the trinity. I looked into Judaism then. Islam really wasn’t on my radar when I met my husband. I feel he did introduce me to Islam. But he had a hard time answering my questions or explaining things, that’s what happens when you are spoon fed your religion. And also, the religion and culture gets intertwined, and it’s hard to separate what is what. 

Meeting and getting to know some Muslim women really fueled my interest in Islam. It’s so cliche but it just felt right and made sense to me. My husband was actually shocked when i converted to Islam. And funny enough, it was a bit harder at first because I’d challenge his views on things.  "
You could also call the cops on him. Revenge porn is a crime in most states now.
"To moving to Saudi?

They all freaked the fuck out. Mom removed my pictures from her walls. My sisters cried and called me horrible names. 

My one Aunt tried to reach out to me and express her concern,  but kinda put down my husband in a way. 

"
"Watching my partner drink a cup of dip.

"
White European blend sounds like a pretty good tea
"I’d get a lot of looks from other Saudi women when they realized my husband and I were married. People would go out of there way to point or stare at us. 

But I didn’t make any new friends. I mostly hung out with my husband’s sisters and family.  "
"This is hard, I was very aware of what Saudi culture was like before I went in. 

But it’s just like a bizarre land where everything is different. One thing, people of opposite gender not making eye contact, not greeting each other. I can’t tell you how many times I’m just smiling and looking around and getting creepy or wide eye looks back at me. 

Also the general lack of building codes and wires running everywhere, the dumpsters of trash over flowing and litter everywhere. the horrible conditions of roads and lack of stop lights and signs. The incredibly unsafe drivers and traffic. It really opened my eyes to things I took for granted in the US. "
"Own it man. A friend of mine had an accident during circumcision and he has a baby dick. That dude was open about it and he got so much ass. He's engaged now. The guy had threesomes, tons of chicks, and honestly he's not even very good looking.

Another guy I know has a micro penis and he tells everyone. It's no secret. He is a very good looking dude though, but he also gets tons of ass. 

Think about it... would you rather that girls and your friends talk about your small cock behind your back or laugh about it with you? Would you rather have a chick know what to expect or find out during the act? 

You can't change it, so you have to own it. You can either spend your life worrying about it or just say screw it. If a chick likes you or dislikes you it's not going to be because of your dick, and if she does then who needs her anyways? There's always the options of toys, open relationships, polyamory, or even surgery if it is really making you that crazy.

It's funny because I'm a grower and not a show-er.  Actually have a very above average penis size, but it doesn't look like it limp. If there's ever a situation where a new girl is going to see my flaccid penis before she has seen it erect, I always warn them that I'm a grower.  

EDIT: Dudes, I was not in any way trying to brag about my dick size. Seriously. Was just relating with my own experience. You act like I said something totally unrelated, but this is a post about penises."
"I don't have any proof, and that sucks. I don't have a dash cam and I can't prove that he was the one who spread revenge porn, even though I know he was the only one who got the pictures. Taught me never trust crazy people."
"Not that common in the culture but for my family it is pretty common. My parents are wealthy and so are my husband's family. They view marriage as a business transaction.

&gt; And how was it discovering each other after marriage?

I didnt meet the guy in person until a few days before marriage. I was honestly very scared. I thought I was going to marry this old, sleazy, scumbag but instead it turned out to be an old, sleazy, scumbag's extremely handsome son. I was still reluctant but he was very nice and a few days after marriage, we lost our virginity to each other. We were also the same age so we connected well with each other."
"Were there any instances of ""getting away"" with stuff because you're American (apart from the driving story)?"
"Yea, there was a news story a few years ago where several girls in died in a dormitory fire, because they couldn't get the proper clothes on to leave in time.

Edit: I misrememnered the girls were forced back into the building by a local group. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/1387874/15-girls-die-as-zealots-drive-them-into-blaze.html"
"Obviously my husband isn’t a douche. But I think you find that in any country. I know so many wonderful Saudi men, but also know some horrible jerks. 

I also think the culture in Saudi kinda perpetuates that very manly and arrogant attitude in men. My husband is a bit goofy and cheerful guy, but in Saudi I noticed he felt the need to look and act serious. "
"I can read and write Arabic, extremely slowly. But I don’t understand it. 

I only know a bit of conversational basic Arabic. I do know enough to pick up on some conversations around me. 

My apartment was was really nice. Three bedroom and two and half baths.  Formal living and dining area. A decent maid room and bathroom. Took us forever to find one I liked enough though. Oh and I got to design and have the kitchen installed. Because the kitchens are just empty rooms. I was able to get large size appliances (normal size to Americans).  And I furnished it with mostly Ikea. "
Wow! You just answered all of the questions that came to me first. Thank you for sharing. 
"I was from a preferred country. Americans and Europeans seemed to be considered more respected. 

It’s not like I was treated like a queen. But I just noticed they would be nicer or cater to my needs more so than what was necessary. "
Isn't there anywhere else you could go for a while?
"My husband is an American citizen now. He’s always worked full time to support me and our children. He’s currently finishing up his PhD. 

He’s the type of immigrants this country needs. "
"They also disowned me when they found out I converted to Islam. They were okay with the marriage,  but not Islam. 

"
"I'm a Lebanese American man who grew up in Jeddah. I took my American wife there a couple times to visit family, she loved the abaya so much she started wearing it here. I feel shy a little when she does because of the looks she gets, but she doesn't give a shit because she says it's convenient and comfortable."
"But all jokes aside anything with kids by default.

But I've seen some weird and disturbing things. Decapitations, a guy get sucked into the prop of a boat, had a woman die in my arms, a skydiver who fell straight onto someones front porch... but out of all of those and not being kid related probably this woman who jumped off a building and landed on someones balcony, impaled through the jaw by a camera tripod, still alive."
"Wow, I feel for you, though I do understand the need to maintain appearances back at home.

Do you have the opportunity to leave Saudi Arabia and live in a western country where you will not be persecuted for your non-belief in their god.

Consider working hard in your studies, and the apply for a scholarship in another country,  then live as your true self."
Very much. It really wasn't that bad and I love my husband and we have three beautiful kids! 
"It was a number of things. 

My husband was really unhappy at his job. Financially we were in rough spot. 

My in laws had been living with us while my father in law had some pretty major surgeries at a nearby major hospital. When he had recovered enough and it was time for him to return my husband was still really worried about his health. 

My mother in law got my husband a job offer and my husband wanted to take it. 

I actually didn’t want to go. Even though I realized being married to him it was always a possibility, I just didn’t think it was the right time. We fought about it, but ultimately I figured I’ll give it a shot. I don’t regret it, I don’t plan on moving back anytime soon though. "
I’m graduating next month with a degree in engineering and yes I’ve actually been working towards obtaining a PR in Australia. But right now I can only hope for the best.
"Yes, the internet is censored. The first time I got a blocked site notification page, I was trying to look up some breastfeeding information. I was confused and thought the internet was down. And my husband laughed and said it was a blocked website. 

I also got a blocked website when trying to look up something about Israel or Judaism, I can’t remember which one it was. 

I’m not sure about forbidden books. But people can just disappear for anything. For tweets, for blogs, for talking out in public. I was actually afraid for my husband. Once he got mad  at traffic that was caused by the royal family. And when they drove past he was yelling out the window at them. I was trying to pull him back in the car terrified they hear him. You have to be very careful not to step out of place. "
"Yeah, it seems like slavery. I saw apartments where  the maid would just get a closet and would take out a mattress at night and sleep in the hallway. That was a huge “what the fuck?” from me. 

But at the same time, it’s dependent  on the family they work for. I know my inlaws treat their maids and drivers with the respect and consider them part of the family. Several workers have been with the family for over a decade. 

I do think the immigrant workers have to take a big risk and hope for the best. There’s no minimum wage, so you pay these people wages that would be considered good in their home country. So that’s why people are from very poor countries, doing it for a chance at better life. "
Welcome to Islam. 
"First of all.. There's no way I'd be part of a polygamous relationship. Ironically I'm sure my parents will kill me if I did something like that, especially my mother.  

Yes, we all live together, my eldest brother is 10 years older than I am so by the time I was old enough to want privacy they had gone to boarding school. Right now. It's just me and my parents (3 of them my dad divorced his second wife before I was born) . My older siblings work now and have left the house. Growing up still we always had a full house, especially holidays. 

About feeling left out,  I cannot really speak for anyone but I feel sad for my step mother. Growing up I didn't notice that my mother was the ""favorite"" it wasn't until I was around 15 that I started to notice, they were always together being all husband and wifey while my step mother was alone by herself. I think she is a loner but also used religion to fill the gaps of loneliness. I feel bad for her.  But she never even tries sometimes to hang out with us or something.  

"
Girlfriend at work. I don't know anyone here. My best friend who lived you here is in jail for another 8 years in Texas 
I won’t turn my car on until everyone is buckled up. Across interweb fist bump from fellow EMT 👊👊
Were there any parts of the culture in Saudi Arabia that you felt were an improvement over American practices?
"When you married your husband, were you asked to convert to Islam?

Please feel free to answer this question only if you are comfortable with it. 

Thanks for the AMA!"
"Yes. Live in help is very normal. As well as having drivers. The drivers live in little rooms on the outside of the houses, near the driveway. "
"Yes, they had a flashing red light next to their bed that would flash when I cried or made other loud sounds. Nowadays there's all sorts of apps and technology, but this was the late 70s, so a red lamp had to do.

They kept me in view more than hearing parents might, and compensated where necessary. It did mean a few mishaps though - one day as a crawling baby I went missing in the house and my mum obviously couldn't follow my cries. She found me stuck head-first in a waste paper basket.
"
"Yeah, they eventually got over it. They were just scared. We actually talked more often, video called frequently. 

We are all fine now. They’ve actually been really outspoken in support  of my family during these trump times. "
The yelling is increasingly louder. Followed by bangs and thuds. Like a homemade version of the Flight of Eagles. Without the woodwind. 
"Your single comment literally answered most of my concerns about Australia. I have met couple of Australians around Malaysia and Thailand and they’re few of the coolest people I know.
I absolutely despise spiders and snakes and I’m sure I’ll encounter a fair share of them if I migrate there. But in retrospect, I’d rather be killed by a spider than by my own family."
"American and Europeans just seemed to be respected more. I don’t, they just consider us high class.  Not sure if that has to do with them usually there working at higher up corporate jobs. "
"Not quite, you can still bring him to court. It is illegal to spread lewd or otherwise naked photos of another person without their consent.
"
"If you're underage they can start an investigation, seeing as it's considered child porn.  That shit is a serious offense."
"What annoys me is the people who clap and cheer when the plane lands, makes me cringe."
"Yes, that’s exactly how I feel! I almost ordered some that look more like a dress than robe to wear here. If I go back to visit I want to get a dark blue one. "
The only question we need to ask is: what were you thinking? 
"No. I was once followed home from the mall by a man. And that really freaked me out. 

But overall I felt really safe. I actually didn’t worry about gun violence at all. "
"This really has nothing to do with the overall topic, but I'm curious. Completely understand if you'd prefer not to answer, I admit it's a bit of a loaded question.

Given that you weren't able to fully buy into Christian theology and subsequently decided to ""leave"" it, then passed on Judaism, it seems like you felt you needed a religion of some sort. Can you explain the mindset behind this? I'm genuinely curious, am not trying to belittle you or your choices, just gain some understanding."
"To the Saudis foreign women (non-Muslim non-Arab) are considered whores and are thus held to a lower standard than Saudi women. This is the same reason why Saudi tourists have a reputation for being creeps and scumbags, because they go to other countries and treat the women there as if they're lesser people (men too, but women to a greater degree), because to them they're 'used goods' that they can have a bit of fun with before they have to settle down with a good Saudi women in a few years."
I'd love to hear about the aftermath. 
"I'm a man with a wife and daughters and sisters.

You think I would like that kind of place knowing the people I love are being jacked over?

I mean it's great if you are a single male narcissist, otherwise it just seems kind of incredibly terrible.

I mean...I don't want to be a chauffeur! 

/s"
"I think just knowing my husband had rights over me was enough to make me feel inferior.  I’m not sure if those guardianship laws have changed, but at the time I wouldn’t have been able to travel out of the country without his approval. 

"
Also it's not uncommon for the passenger in the back seat to kill the person in the front seat with their own head and teeth. Buckle up.
What are your favorite and least favorite experiences from your time there?
"Syrians are even more liberal in their views than Saudis. Of all the Syrians I have met, they are such humble and genuinely nice people. 
"
Still sounds shitty.
"Christians disown family member, blame it on something else. "
"Yep. For a while, we had no romantic connection. He was basically my super cute roommate. Eventually we did fall in love and we had a lot of similarities. We were very sexually compatible as well. "
"Yes, please stop it. I'm happy you like sign language so much, it is a beautiful language, but when people are just trying to have a conversation it is off-putting to have someone staring at them, even if it's in admiration. We're not here for your viewing pleasure.

If my mum and I spot someone staring, we like to get outlandish. Do ridiculous exaggerated signs, start doing the sign of the cross, waving our arms about, etc. Or just turn and wave directly at them. That usually stops them."
How were your interactions with other women there?
That's badass man. I love hearing these kind of stories. Not the shit childhood part but the making it from nothing part and traveling around.
I found him yesterday and took him in. We both got really attached but I dont have the means to care for a dog and I want him to have the best chance
And I don't leave for work until tomorrow. I'm a traveling Inventory Associate. 
Literally r/whiteknighting for m’lady
"How did you prepare for the transition before you moved??
Did your husband tell you about all the gender-rules/laws? I assume it's not a culture where you can/it's acceptable to learn-as-you-go."
"I don’t mind the question. I had abandoned a notion of a higher being at one point and considered myself agnostic. But during my biology studies, the complexity of life and how it just all comes together, even the existence of the universe itself, it just made me feel like there is something out there. I realized I do have faith in God and started seeking out what spoke to me the most and what I felt comfortable with. I really didn’t go seeking out Islam, and it actually shocked me when I started looking into it. "
"Yes, they can both drive cars and motorbikes.

Some friends were a bit awkward with my parents because they have quite strongly deaf voices and can be difficult to understand, but I was always there to interpret, and after the first time it was always fine. And they liked the thrill of being able to say anything in front of them. And being able to play music loud. I had a lot of sleepovers.

I always had quite a few CODA friends. As I was an only child, and we went to the Deaf club a lot, I used to hang out with the other CODAs. We got away with absolute murder. And when my parents' friends would visit with their children, we kids realised that if we just kept out of sight, we'd be forgotten about and would get to stay late.

As an adult and parent now myself, I realise that the parents wanted to stay late visiting their friends too and were delighted we kids kept out of the way. But as a child it felt like we were totally getting one over on them."
Place sounds like a true hell on earth.

Did you speak the language? What was your apartment like?
"Do you think the different treatment was because you're American, or maybe because you were a guest/ stranger?"
"I think you're swallowing what fox news is secreting a bit too much. I don't know about Afghanistan but in Syria women drive and posses governmental positions. It's a liberal country that offers free education and health care to all. Their schools are coed, unlike our ally ksa. 


As for their refugees, rest assured the US is only allowing their high quality people in. The uneducated and lower classes are being kept in UN camps in Lebanon and Jordan."
"No, it's Islam. From someone who's family has come from Islamic countries I can tell you that Islam is practised very similar throughout the Islamic world, with the exceptions of countries such as Jordan and Oman. My grandfather was an Iranian, when he moved to the UK he made the most of his freedom and drank alcohol, left Islam then married my grandma, a white Spanish lady. He was shunned by his family and would've been severely punished if he just drank alcohol or married an 'infidel' in Iran, having been caught leaving Islam would've gotten him killed. I have a friend from Egypt who's told me in his own words that they have regular 'street killings' of exposed gays. Saudi Arabia follows Islam in its purest form, and the result is Wahabism. Please don't be one of those people who defend Islam without knowing about what the mainstream media doesn't show you.

"Australia, cool.  Just don't come by boat, our government frowns upon that /s.

I keep hearing that we do not have enough engineers, so hopefully you will get accepted to immigrate here.  Good luck, I hope you get accepted to live here in Australia.

Australia generally is a great country, we have a shoddy government at the moment, but that is another story and hopefully we will vote them out at the next election.

I really could not tell you much about the process for immigration to Australia since I was born here, but hopefully one of my fellow citizens who did immigrate here will pipe in.

You may hear stories that we are racist, but in reality most of us are not any more racist than any other nationality, we just like to beat ourselves over it for some reason.  But most of us do not care where others come from, since we were built on immigration, it is always the minority that cause the problems unfortunately.

You may also be told about the Dropbears, spiders, snakes and sharks.  It is no where near as dangerous as we make it out to be.  You have more chance of being killed by lightning than be killed by our fauna."
What would you say is the biggest culture shock as an American?

Are you happy?

"Living in Jeddah is a lot different than the rest of the country. So it’s hard to say.  But at the time, dress code and women’s driving ban was enforced pretty strict.  Also, cracking down on illegal immigrants. They would do random stop and checks for proper paperwork (targeting the immigrant workers from poor nations). 

But the religious police power was kinda waning in Jeddah at the time, people were kinda turning on them. I rarely saw them. But the young security officers at the mall entrances took their jobs way too seriously. My husband got turned away for wearing shorts that showed his knee. And once he left the mall to get something from the car, and they wouldn’t let him back in (being a single male). I had to go find him and we had to show our id’s proving our marriage. 

 Slack laws would be about the woman must be with a male guardian. I see people comment about that, but I never once saw it. Women went about their lives freely. They take taxis or have drivers to take them out. I never saw a woman being harassed for not having a male guardian with her.  

And what the us has wrong about saudi? Do you mean the government? I don’t like how they so blindly support Saudi in all they do, but they want  that Saudi money so it won’t change. "
"Hey, great on you for holding your head up high. His attempt to break you down and make you suffer, failed, epically!!!  Smile crocodile. "
"Sorry my phone's messing up. That's why the response was edited. Well they stayed up a few days and have been screaming and yelling for most of it. The sole cause is the meth.

Called me alot of names for no reason. She's crazy to sum it up. And my step dad feeds into it or something. She doesn't work. Only leaves the house when he does. She will often say she is a prisoner and the house is her jail cell. But really if you ask her to get out if the house like walk or something she is too sick. Says she has a tumor on her stomach. Bleeding from her vagina. Thinks she has arthritis, cancer, and a bunch of other things. It's very frustrating to deal with. "
"Just writing to say that I hated you as a kid. You were everything I was taught to hate. You was the big scary monster that was there to scare my parents off. You were so cold to me and would barely talk to me.

But as I’m older I want to say thank you. Thank you for being my silent hero. For being the beacon of light in my surrounding darkness. Now I understand that it tore you up to know that I hated you while I loved the ones that hurt me so much. When all you was doing was protecting me. 

Thank you so much for what you do and the children you protect."
My family and my husbands view marriage as a business transactions so status/money.
"Where there any restrictions regarding the Internet or literature allowed in Saudi? What I mean by that is, were there websites that were inaccessible or books that were ""forbidden"" and could have constituted a crime if you somehow were caught in their possession? "
"They also do execution by beheading and on occasion crucify the corpse (probably really rare but, google says it was done in 2009)."
"Honestly California, I lived in a small town in the mountains and it was so beautiful with perfect weather and great people. I don't think I could handle their cities though. I really loved Montana too, beautiful country, and Athens, GA was definitely the coolest city I've ever lived in. 

For vacation I'd say CO or CA both are expensive to live in but great for a stay. "
