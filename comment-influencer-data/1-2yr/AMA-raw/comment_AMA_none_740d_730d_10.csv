I see that you've received that email as well. 
"At the end of the year, then I'll cut it and donate it to make wigs for cancer patients, then rinse and repeat. "
"My friend said to be cool for the pic , that was the product "
"It's not that extreme. To be a doctor, nurse, lawyer, teacher, etc you'd have to pass certain board exams that I can't help with (e.g I cant do it for them). This is more for people who want to do office administration, social work, (sometimes teachers who. can pass their subject (say english) but have to take biology, math, history, etc.) I just get paid to do it all as a bundle. I feel no guilt whatsoever. The education system is bullshit, the degree means nothing and I am just profiting from it (like universities and the government do!) "
Fucking the homeless with a job. Don't you listen?

Could you PLEASE be Prince for Halloween?
Humming the song in your head is literally imagining sound :/
I got you! My uncle calls me Prince cause I look a lot like him 
What stocks should I trade tomorrow?
I don't work there but I did volunteer at one for 30 hours. They don't wash the clothes they just spray them with a generic fabric freshener so I'm sure it's the same scent for all the stores.

"The RoastMe will go up soon, my account needs to become older"
Wrong kind of trade secrets.
"I didn't get paid for donation, only expenses for the trip to there were covered. It's not about the money, it's about donating to spread your semen around a World. ;)"

Youre a cool dude Vemal. 
"1 ) It's an unoriginal answer, but I really do believe in the magic that Disney makes for people and that it can change lives, because it certainly changed mine. Being able to pay that forward as a career was a huge deal for me, especially in a field I love (technical theatre). Getting this job was big for me, because I'd been applying and denied for about three years before I was finally accepted. 

2 ) As an Entertainment Tech, I worked there for just under 3 months (right before my 90 day probation period was up). Before that, I worked as a Disney College Program employee for five months (Jan-May 2013), then a Disney Intern for seven months (Jan-July 2015).

3 ) No, I never found out why. Because I was still in my 90 day probation, they didn't have to give me a reason, so they didn't. The best I can come up with is that the company was having financial troubles thanks to Disneyland Shanghai so cuts were made, but I'll never know the exact reason."
"I think you are. Social work and teaching are fields regularly criticized for a lack of competence. Also, those are not career fields where I want someone who was morally okay with your ""services."" "

"Basically works the technical aspects of any live entertainment at disney world. This includes sound, lighting, crew, effects and pyrotechnics. If there's anything with a live actor / puppet / fireworks, a entertainment tech works it."
"Yeah, the infrastructure can withstand it. Almost every house and building here is made with concrete (except really poor areas) because of the hurricanes -we've had some pretty bad ones like San Felipe in 1928 or Hugo in the 80's. Surely, with the heavy rainfall that's yet to come the agricultural areas will be affected for a couple of days (even more so if the now hurricane Jose brings more rain this Sunday), but nothing too great. 

I don't think the island will get hit too hard like it was expected, but I really appreciate your concern and your interest in helping out. "
"I became homeless in late November of '08.  I had lost my job the previous August and, since the town I lived in was small, I had a hard time finding anything steadier than day-labor work.  The house I was renting with a few others was foreclosed on and the landlady tried to be sly, claiming she had no idea about a foreclosure and that it must have been some sort of clerical error.  When I called her bluff and withheld rent until she could prove her claim, she evicted the entire house, shut off the utilities, and avoided our calls.  We squatted for a while but eventually had to move on.  Since this town was just south of a major city, even the cheapest rent was more than I could afford.

As for my family, the only one that could and would offer assistance was my Great-Grandmother and while she did let me stay occasionally, she was bound by the rules of her Homeowners Association and her limited income.  The occasional hot meal was the best she could do."
Oh good... just social work and teaching! /s
I was an Entertainment Tech working at Hollywood Studios.
What was your job precisely?
"A tough one.  I suppose the most important thing I learned is who is really helping.  Most of my friends abandoned me because there was nothing I could give them.  The police and the churches turned me away.  I wasn't the type the wanted to be seen helping.  Most figured I was a drunk or an addict even though I kept my appearance relatively clean.

It wasn't organizations or people I knew from before but people I met while in the streets that actually stood by me.

I learned who my friends really were."
"&gt;1.) What is it that you hate?

That everyone seems to fucking love everything about Disney automatically and that everything they make or do is magical and perfect. Also the company has grown too large and powerful making it dangerous to smaller competitors. 

I also hate the core Disney character cast (Mickey and the lot) that keep getting recycled just for the sake of they've always been there. 

Lastly, when people deck their whole damn house out with every stupid thing in it with Disney it's disgusting. You don't need Disney tables, lamps, salt shakers, rugs, mugs, sheet, shoes, shampoo, wrist watch, ties, and vibrators, that's too much! 

&gt;2.) Why?

It's like Disney is a siren just calling out to people making them fall in love with them. When people love content any brand makes unconditionally just because it's *brand* I think that's stupid. 

I'm also scared of them buying out two of my favorite companies, LucasfilmÂ and Marvel. How much content will they change or censor to fit their views? Also, seeing Mickey dress as Luke Skywalker is irritating and Iron Man should never be sold as a soft cuddly plushy. 

I just see everything they make as a ploy to take money from people wrapped up in a pretty bow. 

&gt;3.) How long have you felt this way?

I'm in my late 20's but I would say a long time, maybe at least 15 years. Grew up with Disney VHS's and went to Disney, FL once. 

&gt;4.) Do you think your opinion could ever be changed? 

I am skeptically optimistic about the Marvel Cinematic Universe's current direction and really enjoy all the Netflix Marvel content (sans S1 Iron Fist) so if they leave their creative input out if it and just give Marvel more cash to do what they do I'd be thankful for that. 

&gt;5.) Do people around you/close to you feel the same? 

My brothers to a lesser extent but I feel like I really am the only one in a sea of Disney drones stuck on my tiny island of belief.

How many times have you lost your virginity since the post made the front page?
"Very nice. Im here for in laws 50th anniversary with my wife and her sisters and their kids.  The weather has been excellent!  I just wish they ended the trip early and docked us on Thursday or Friday- My SIL has two very little kids and they're running out of supplies.   This ship is huge. Too huge. ITs the largest in the world and it feels that way. Everything is super crowded and after 7 days of dealing with fat people cramming themselves into elevators Im kinda ready to leave.  They say they plan on taking us back Tuesday-  i just hope nothing goes wrong with the toilets.
"
"No clue, my friend say the same thing... Hopefully it works "
"To get it straight first, all of us hate the extremists and talibans as much as u do and we are not at all anti-americans or hating the wests
but america's war on terror is just an excuse to invade other countries and bring turmoil to them thats what some of us think"
That's actually pretty fucking hilarious.
I am asking about your bed as you have told me to.
Please post here in the morning. I live in Georgia and I'm terrified for all of you on your islands...180 mph winds are nothing to be messed with! Stay safe (or as safe as humanly possible).
"Up until now it has been fairly calm. Some occasional strong winds, but nothing scary yet. We were supposed to get some hurricane winds at 6 pm but it's almost 8 pm and I haven't felt anything. "
I had a very similar experience. I'm a surgeon now. Keep pushing forward.
"Well, I just heard on the radio that apparently the worst part already passed and that just some heavy rainfall remains for the island. So everything should be fine. I am well, thank you. "
What was your first thought as you opened the locker?
Only very small puddles
No question. I'm just glad you're okay and I'm really sorry that happened to you. It sounds like those 2.5 years were anything but easy. Hope you're feeling better with the post stress. 
"In some ways, yes. I have a naturally quiet voice. I can't really run all that well. I Get questions about my smaller-then-average hands and face.

I usually don't think about it. I just feel lucky I don't have cerebral palsy or something. "
"My voice is breathy and sounds like a whisper, I need to wear glasses, and I've had a heart surgery and two eye surgeries.  "
"With that attitude, you're going to do great things. Keep doing what you're doing."

Omg he talked to me im awesome
You spelt shift as shit. It must be pretty late at night. 
"Not really rules that can be bent but there are rules we can stop bending. Like if your order is messed up and you're nice about it, we usually let you keep the item and give you a new one. If you're missing an item, we'll give you two. If you're waiting a long time, we give you something small to make up for it. We're not supposed to do these things. We're not even supposed to mix freezes for people. And if you're rude, you can bet your ass we'll remind you of that. "
"Do you ever feel any guilt  about the (likely) potential that you are enabling unqualified people/cheaters to be put into positions of potential power/authority/care? 
I'm thinking doctors, teachers, police officers, politicians (yeah, not much hope there to begin with)... but I want these people qualified to be doing their jobs. Imagine ending up in the ER and it turns out your doctor skipped the semester where they learned to treat your unique condition.

I don'r remember. Warm hopefully

"You're welcome. Thank you for the kind words. Thankfully for me, my spouse is an American which means I no longer need DACA. But 800k other people may not be so fortunate. I grew up in America. I love this country. I graduated HS. I PAID for my college education and am a practicing RN. DACA allowed me to help others by giving me an opportunity that otherwise wouldn't be available. I quadrupled my income which means I paid more in taxes. I'm not a unicorn. There's almost a million others like me. "
"Late 20s.I was living in the streets sleeping behind a motel.  Finally got a job right next to buy he mall. T he mall s nt too big. One story but it's pretty wide. I piss in a Togo cup and throw it out in the morninglol. The ceilings are high so I put them far away from me. Only been here a few days I finally got out of the streets. I get one free meal from my job a day. Then I sneak in here for a night's sleep.
My day is I wake up at 630 and find cigarettes on the ground to smoke. Walk to work whitch is next door andwork til abo ut 4.come to the mall and catch free WiFi and entertainment til they close. Then sneak I nt the storage and set up camp! "
"Nah, I'll stay.  I'll pay taxes. I'll be a productive member of my community. "

"Hey don't worry. You will be surrounded by a team of people who will be monitoring your breathing, heart rate, oxygen saturation levels, etc. The anesthesiologist will ask you your weight to determine how much anesthetic to use. It will be injected through an IV. It's a milky white color and once this hits your IV drip, they will ask you to count backwards from 100. You are out by 96. It doesn't hurt. Passing put is sort of nice. The nurses will wake you up when it's done and you will be groggy. They may give you sprite and crackers if you are hungry, but they will monitor you for an hour or so. You may be a little nauseous but this is common. You'll be fine! "

"I have a friend who was born around 4 months early and has all 3 types of cereal palsy there's an awesome picture of him as a baby inside his dad's shoe wearing an action man outfit (G.I.

He's currently 30 and other than a slight speech impediment he's a normal dude smoking weed and fucking hookers ;)"

"I pay plenty of taxes. I even contribute to social security and Medicaid/Medicare yet I'm not entitled to either. I worked my way to afford an education. I'm an computer engineer. My salary of $70,xxx  at least 25% or more goes to Uncle Sam. But I'm not entitled to any of the benefits.

Who says illegals don't pay taxes? I pay property tax. I pay sales tax. I pay into social security. I pay more or average then a persons fair share.

"We were supposed to back to Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale today, instead they took us to Costa Maya Mexico yesterday and today we are just cruising slow to nowhere.  Rumor is we will go to Cozumel tomorrow or the next day.

The issue we are worried about is if the port in FL does not open.  This ship is so fucking huge only a few ports can accept it.  

Of course I am safe and comfortable and my heart goes out to all the folks in Florida and elsewhere-- I feel guilty actually.  My mom lives in Florida and they are prepped and ready. 

I live in AZ and I think the adventure getting home begins when we dock eventually!

"Profressional investor here, I suggest you invest $100,000 into my newy opened kiosk selling Pho and Indian Curry.

I hope you will do the right choice on investing in my kiosk. It is da best. "
"Probably not. Except that I should have died from not getting an immediate steroid injection. Doctors can't explain why I survived.

"It's a reference the the Nigerian prince emails people sometimes get. They say something like ""Hello I am a royal prince from Nigeria. I have to get money to people in the states that I have inherited! If you transfer the 11 million dollars I inherited, I will give you 10%! Now, just give me $250 for processing fees please."" Basically the person says they don't have access to a pool of money so you access it for them, and you take a share of the money to make it worth your while. They ask for the initial fee to see if you will bite (""only $250 to wire all the money over there""),Then they ask for another processing fee for something like transportation, and then there's more unexpected fees for customs , and more, and more, until finally you realize that there is no 11 million dollars, you aren't getting your 1 million cut, and you sunk a few grand into scammers from India."
"Is not very common for the area that I live in to flood so, other than heavy winds, you could say I am in a safe area.

And because we have a gas stove we've been cooking some for us and the neighbors.
