"We love GitHub login. Your GitHub account is your developer identity, and many users are accustomed to signing into developer tools and services (e.g. Travis, Circle) with their GitHub accounts. So, if anything, we may decide to add GitHub as a login option to Microsoft."
"Developers are really particular about their setup, and choosing an editor is one of  the most personal decisions a developer makes. Languages change, jobs change, you often get a new computer or upgrade your OS, but you usually pick an editor and grow with it for years. The last thing I would want to do is take that decision away from Atom users.

Atom is a fantastic editor with a healthy community, adoring fans, excellent design, and a promising foray into real\-time collaboration. At Microsoft, we already use every editor from Atom to VS Code to Sublime to Vim, and we want developers to use any editor they prefer with GitHub.

So we will continue to develop and support both Atom and VS Code going forward."
"Developers are independent thinkers and will always have a healthy degree of skepticism, but I admit I was sad to see that some felt compelled to move their code. I take the responsibility of earning their trust seriously.

OTOH, I think it’s great that git gives developers the flexibility to move their repos like this, and I hope those who have tried out other Git hosts in the past few days will keep an open mind and consider moving back once we’ve demonstrated our commitment to openness and made GitHub even better. If they choose not to move back, that’s their prerogative and we celebrate developer choice even when developers don’t choose us.

That said, the GitHub team reports that the set of users who have migrated or closed their accounts is extremely small, and this is more than made up for by the surge of new signups and new interest in GitHub this week."
"They're cute and squishy, when I was a kid i was fascinated by them because they were always lying on the beach dead"
"No.

(Some historical context: when GitHub started, Sourceforge was the dominant code hosting site on the internet. Sourceforge was eventually owned by a media conglomerate, who heavily monetized the site through advertising. It became a swamp of banner ads and pop ups and delayed downloads to expose users to more ads. GitHub's clean interface and developer\-centric approach can be seen in part as a reaction against Sourceforge. It's obviously been the right path.)"
What plans does Microsoft have regarding GitHub's Atom text editor (which obviously overlaps in target user with VS Code)?
So what do you like in women?
"I will never forget emacs. I used emacs from \~1994 to \~2006 full\-time, and had a heavily\-customized .emacs. In fact, emacs is how I discovered free software: hitting C\-h C\-c shows you the GPL."
"Please strongly consider keeping paid services on Github, especially paid private repos.  

1. By offering free public repos, developers are encouraged to openly publish code, making Github very valuable to the software community as a resource.
2. By offering paid private repos you encourage professionals to have a stake in the platform. Revenue is a much clearer indicator of value and will help ensure that Github has a long future ahead of it.

I have had a paid account for ~6 years. I'm happy to pay for it and would happily pay more."
Fear.
"Edward Snowden revealed only 5 years ago that Microsoft cooperated with the NSA to install a backdoor into outlook.com. Tampering of GitHub repositories at the behest of government or corporate actors is, in this context, not unthinkable. Git commit signing is the obvious best defense against this, but we are in a landscape where most software engineers don't yet know how to do this.

How can Microsoft work to cryptographically prove repository history is never tampered with and that old vulnerable versions of releases are not served to select clients?"
"I always sleep nude, even if it’s only a 5 minute nap, it’s way more comfortable, but it has lead to me being arrested on numerous occasions and being banned from all forms of public transport "
"One of the cool things about GitHub is that GitHub runs on GitHub; their sales, marketing, and legal functions actually use issues and pull requests to collaborate across the company. This means that all of the various teams work in the open, and this contributes to a very collaborative culture (it also means that new lawyers at GitHub learn how to merge a PR and which emojis to use when they join!)."
"&gt;I take the responsibility of earning their trust seriously.

Love this attitude. That is all."
"I start off by folding the end, like you would fold sheets, pushing the remains out with the force of the fold"
"Is there any truth to the rumor that Clippy will be joining your team? I think ""You appear to have a merge conflict. How can I help you?"" is a good fit for Github."
What is your response to people moving repos to GitLab and other providers?
"As a _consumer_, I heavily distrust Microsoft.

As a _developer_, MS has been nothing but good to me.  They make top-tier products, have abandoned SourceSafe in favor of git, and recent moves to open-source .NET and such have been great.  I think this acquisition will be a very good thing for GitHub."
"You forgot Emacs?.. As a Vim evangelist, I've gotta keep some respect for my arch enemy."

"Please do this. Microsoft has, far and away, the worst authentication experience of any company I use on a regular basis. Even LastPass can't help me remember my passwords because I have logins scattered across 3 Microsoft (live.com, microsoftonline.com, and azure.com) domains that are used for like 3 different accounts (two company accounts, and my personal account.) Remembering which login on which domain goes to which product is impossible."
"Microsoft hosts the confidential information of more than one billion customers today, and this is a responsibility we take extremely seriously.

GitHub already has policies and controls in place to limit employee access to private repos, and this will remain as tight as ever under Microsoft."
Are you keeping normal GitHub accounts or trying to push users to use a universal Microsoft account for GitHub login?
"Oh man how many characters are allowed for a tripadvisor review?

**0.5/10**

Do not stay at this place. They don’t let you leave, you’re surrounded by guard towers and a moat. The staff (or lack of) will treat you like shit and if you misbehave they will straight up beat you with batons. 

The rooms were a little crowded to say the least. Supposedly they were designed to hold 55 people. We never had less than 75, and sometime as much as 90 people crammed in there. Have you ever seen those pictures of slave ships and how they were transported? Imagine that... but then you’re told you need to squeeze in between those 2 guys. There was a guy in the room who’s job it was to come round and stand on top of you to squeeze you into a non existent spot. 

The entertainment in the rooms was probably the worst experience. Each room has its own CRT tv and a homemade (prison made) amplified and speaker box. I can’t tell you how bad the sound quality that came out of these things was. And the volume was always turned up to 11, oh and you’re watching a pirated movie that is terribly dubbed with Thai audio. Every night. 4pm-10pm. That was the real torture. I don’t think I ever experienced silence apart from if I woke up randomly in the middle of the night. I think the noise was a big part of what helped me just shut off and block everything out. 

The facilities could be better. Warm water would be nice and a private shower wouldn’t hurt. Sharing a cold shower with hundreds of other men and ladyboys isn’t the best. Oh and they don’t even supply soap. The toilets aren’t toilets, it’s a hole in the floor and you have to use a bowl and water when you’re finished. I should mention that you have to buy this bowl... and it’s the same one you eat from every day. 

You have to wash you own clothes and they’ll probably just get stolen when you hang them out to dry so don’t bother wasting your money on them. Don’t bother buying anything apart from food because it will get stolen. 

Daily activities were non existent. If you were a Thai national then you worked. This would be either building work, assembling cigarette lighters or putting buckles on ‘quality handmade’ sandals. I did convince a staff member to let me have a go at working because life there is really boring. The work was almost as boring so I didn’t carry on with it for very long. 

Food wasn’t all that bad. I mean, it was fucking terrible but I like Thai flavours. It was rice and various soups 2 or 3 times a day. I fucking hate rice now btw. The soups weren’t bad tasting, it was usually pork or chicken and sometime fish. The problem was that depending on who was serving your food, you might not actually get any meat. They would knowingly skim the top when serving to foreigners. All with a shit-eating grin on their face. So I wasn’t really getting any nutrition. Once or twice a week we would get a piece of fruit. Maybe a lychee, a wild apple of a passion fruit (but even the fruit got diverted to the black market). 

If you had money then you could live quite well, or at least survive a lot easier. You could buy anything you can think of really. Fried chicken was I went for every time I got money... and that would send my bowels into overdrive. A real shitty time, every time. I bought myself a chocolate cake for my birthday and it was orgasmic. I only had money from a charity that the embassy hooked me up with. About £100 every 2 months. Not much, but extremely grateful. Shoutout to ‘prisoners abroad’.

The only reason I am giving this place 0.5 stars is because of the stories and the people I met. My story is nothing compared to some of the people I met. Also the lesson it taught me and what I’ve learned from it all shouldn’t be taken for granted. 

Don’t waste your time visiting this place. It like a fucking Bangkok prison or something. "
"VS Code and Atom actually share a ton of history and code, and Microsoft and GitHub have collaborated on the foundational technologies for years:

* Most obviously, we work together on Electron, the common foundation for both editors. Microsoft began working with GitHub on Electron when it was announced in 2015 – when it was still called AtomShell and before VS Code was announced. We joined their Slack channels and participated in hackathons, and Microsoft has been a major contributor to Electron ever since. We also use Electron in many other products...
* [Atom\-ide](https://ide.atom.io/) adopted the  [Language Server protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol)  that we developed as part of VS Code. This allows sharing advanced language support between VS Code and Atom. The language packs that Atom\-ide supports all share the language servers with VS Code.
* The Atom\-ide community is also talking about adopting the  [Debug Adapter protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node)  which will enable common debugger support between Atom and VS Code.
* We’re excited about the recent developments in real\-time collaboration, and I expect Atom Teletype and VS Code Live Share to coordinate on protocols so that eventually developers using either editor can edit the same files together in real\-time.

So, I love the years of collaboration between Microsoft and GitHub that have produced these two beloved editors, and I expect this fruitful relationship to continue!"
Should we anticipate any advertising to start appearing on our public GitHub project repositories? 
"This is a fascinating question that the entire community is grappling to understand. We underestimate the degree to which all progress is dependent upon the seedling passion projects of individuals and small groups around the world. There are a lot of people with great ideas who don't have the resources or support to pursue them, and people working on projects which they struggle to sustain because there is no incentive model that fits their work.

Separately, I launched [aigrant.org](https://aigrant.org) last year to provide funding for individuals and small teams pursuing interesting open source AI projects. We've issued over ~~30~~50 grants and it's been amazing to see what an impact a small amount of support and money can have on brilliant people.

It would be amazing to see what we could do in this vein at GitHub scale."
"A foreign body inside of your body for a prolonged period of time can be unsafe for all different reasons. You wouldn’t want something in your butt for too long because you can actually block your intestines with feces. If you have prolonged obstruction it can actually cause tissue death due to lack of oxygen to the surrounding tissues and infection. I can’t give you a definitive timeframe, but I would say that during sexy times you’re good. Whatever you put in your butt during that time should be removed when sexy time is over. "
"I can vouch for this. I'm one of GitHub's lawyers (I already knew how to use GitHub before joining, though, I swear!), and we draft and update our policies (internal and external) in PRs, we discuss contract negotiations in issues, we use Atom and Teletype to collaborate with remote colleagues. We understand how our product works and what its benefits and nuances are. We have a lot of insight into how other teams work, we're very transparent, and we share a lot."
"As a developer I really distrust Microsoft and this acquisition scares the hell out of me.

That being said, this AMA has helped a decent bit "
What are you going to do with the body parts of that child you killed?
"Thanks for the question, but it's too soon for me to know the answer to that. We want GitHub to be accessible to everyone in the world, and for everyone to have an opportunity to be a developer."
"I want to feel loved, but it's kind of selfish for me to want that. All signs point to my inability to reciprocate. It's honestly kind of devastating to watch other people be loved and know that I may be unable to experience that feeling for my whole life. I want to be normal sometimes for that reason, but I'm able to feel at least a little better by reminding myself that if I were to pursue that, i may end up losing some of myself in the pursuit. 

I'm in  relationship now, and I feel guilty every day, honestly. She's incredible, understanding, smart, motivated, and so good to me, and yet outside of the quiet hum of wanting her around in the back of my mind, I find myself feeling empty when I think about her. "
I was like oh noooo...
"Microsoft has a history of censoring data when a government asks it to, such as China.

Will geographical censorship now be extended to GitHub under Microsoft control?"
"AtomShell =&gt; electron. Holy shit, that makes sense. "
"I went back and checked this over the weekend, and my first commit to GitHub was in 2009, when GitHub was a year old. I thought that was pretty legit, but people made fun of me for it being in PHP (PHP is underrated!)."
"Have you ever seen a sword eater? The biggest risk they face is cutting their esophagus open. I personally haven’t heard of someone “breaking” their throat from deep throating. I personally don’t know if it is possible, but I would say that deep throating is fine as long as you take proper precautions like relaxing your throat and remembering to stop every once in a while to take a breath. Btw, never base medical things on pornos. Some of the stuff they do is blatantly dangerous and bad for you. Always ask a doctor or a nurse on Reddit who’s willing to do an AMA. "
"With Microsoft now owning both Github and LinkedIn it has control of the two biggest networks for discovering software engineering talent.

How can Microsoft prove that data or search results about top candidates won't be manipulated in order to tip the hiring scales?"
"I enjoy it medium, otherwise it just gets too tough"
Do you have any plans to make private repos free as on GitLab and BitBucket?
"So that covers the biologist element, what about being a sociopath? "
"Hey Nathan, thanks for your AMA. 

1. What are your plans regarding the integration of github with MS ecosystem (Azure, Active Directory, etc.)?

2. Can we expect a deep integration of github into VS 2019 (like Apple just presented in Xcode with Gitlab)?

3. Are you going to change the pricing plans?

4. Did you notice an outflow of users after the acquisition plans hit the news?

5. What is your strategy for development of GitHub for the next year? 

Cheers!

What are your thoughts on how GitHub can incentivize open source work financially? Perhaps by integrating something like Patreon or OpenCollective in the website.
"First, to be clear, we don't give governments direct access to customer data, and we don't create backdoors: [https://blogs.microsoft.com/datalaw/our\-practices/#did\-participate\-in\-prism\-program](https://blogs.microsoft.com/datalaw/our-practices/#did-participate-in-prism-program)

I love the idea of making it easier for developers to sign their commits, and would support making this the default behavior in VS Code, Atom, and GitHub Desktop (I know it's possible now, but takes some setup and advanced knowledge). This already happens automatically when I make commits in my browser on github.com."

"Also, cranberry juice is nonsense. Vinegar is nonsense. Niacin (and other B's) probably makes it worse by increasing your metabolism -not sure, but it is suggested in some literature. There are no presently known adulterants we don't test for (visine, bleach, zinc, etc). Goldenseal. Nope. Milk thistle. Nope. None of it.

Exercise, however, can play a role. It can be a detriment or a benefit. Here's the way to maximize it. Work out vigorously for 4 or 5 days leading up to the test. Aerobics and muscle building. Burn some fat. You know you need it anyway. But the day before and the day of your test, be lazy as you can. Eat ice cream and other high fat foods. The idea is to store unadulterated fat. This is because the body metabolizes your fat reserves starting with the most recently stored. 

Does that make sense?

Edit: added some anecdotal evidence about niacin. "
"In addition to the most visible public open source repositories, GitHub is home to countless -private- repositories, many of which are owned by companies with offerings that directly compete with Microsoft. This is a very clear conflict of interest.

What steps can Microsoft take to prove private repositories remain private even from Microsoft employees and executives?"
"I like to think he starts his day by opening the Atom project in vscode, builds it, and uses Atom from then on."
"The Web UI signing is seriously broken and a big part of the problem. I have spent a lot of time building signature verification systems and was shocked to find that when you someone hits the ""merge"" button in the UI, Github silently substitues an authors PGP key signature, with their own, impersonating that user.

The only way I can currently prove authorship and code review without having to trust Github is by asking people to \-not\- hit the merge button and to have the approver do the merge manually on the CLI.

In my mind this is a really bad design and in practice I have to do force pushes every time someone uses the merge button to make them re\-sign using their own key, so I can prove they tapped their yubikey locally to sign.

I prototyped a solution to this problem that could be easily integrated into IDEs, code review tools, and remote verification tools. See: [https.://github.com/lrvick/git\-signatures](https://github.com/lrvick/git-signatures) . If you decide to work on tools like this as open source code, hit me up.

I really hope you are serious about this. The easiest way to earn trust is to make it so people don't need to trust you."

While enjoying your necrophilia - what is the perfect corpse penis size for you?
Why would you be with someone who calls you fat knowing you are depressed? Sounds like a fuckin asshole. Drop THAT weight and you will feel better. 
"I don’t know the answer to the first one. I don’t think that you can get a straight answer on that because it’s not that easy to measure how much blood is in one place at one time. Especially because everyone has a different amount of capillaries and such. 

And the condition you’re talking about is called Priapism. It’s dangerous because when the penis has blood in it that long it means that the venous return is being blocked. This causes damage to the tissues inside the penis because it’s being deprived of oxygen. Just like if you were to tie a string around your finger and block the blood flow you could cause permanent damage to your finger, the same can happen to a penis. 

Hope this was helpful. Sorry I couldn’t answer the first question. "

What will happen to the GitHub student developer package?

Second Question:

And I was wondering what will happen with ""controversial"" repositories such as xbox, nintendo emulators or other tools/ software / data that are morally and legally questionable, at least in some part of the world. For example, if I remember correctly the tools to create deepfakes is still available on GitHub.

Till now GitHub was able to stay fairly neutral, mainly because of a low general public influence (Most people don't even know what Git is.  Microsoft on the other hand is so large and an easy target for social media campaigns, advertisers removing ads or even governments. Therefore MS has to please many more than GitHub and has to stay clear of controversies. What will happen with such repositories?"

Hi Nat, thank you for your time. I wish you the best of luck with the new awesome peeps over at GitHub!  My question is this: What kind of integration, competition, deprecation, etc. can we expect with regards to VSTS and GitHub both offering very similar services? Are there plans for the products and/or teams to be merged together from both areas or will they remain separate?|Millions of developers rely on VSTS, including Microsoft itself. VSTS also has lots of functionality that's beyond version control, including CI, release management, manual test management, etc. Our plan is to continue to support both VSTS version control and GitHub, and to do the integration work so that VSTS users have a great experience, with full integration and traceability, if they choose to use GitHub for version control.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8pc8mf/im_nat_friedman_future_ceo_of_github_ama/e0a26fk/)

Do you still write code? if yes, what are your dev tools?|I do write some code, mostly Python in VS Code today. I did a chunk of the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) ML class last year, and write some personal tools regularly to do things like manage my photos and files, or analyze data I'm interested in.

What are the plans for cross\-platform GVFS?|We built GVFS to make it possible for the Windows team to switch to Git, which they have done successfully (yes, Windows is now built on the version control system that Linus Torvards invented!).  Windows is a huge codebase (\~300GB, \~4M files) and extremely actively developed codebase. Git has a bunch of operations which scale linearly with the size of the codebase, so we developed GVFS to help Git perform better in these extreme scenarios.  We’ve started building macOS support for GVFS with the help of the Office team in Microsoft: [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/03/15/gvfs\-for\-mac/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/03/15/gvfs-for-mac/).  And we’ve actually been working with GitHub for a while to build GVFS for Linux (It would be easier if we could use FUSE, but unfortunately the performance isn't good enough).  I understand that GitHub is hiring for this, so if it’s something that you’re interested in, check out [https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1121642](https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1121642).|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8pc8mf/im_nat_friedman_future_ceo_of_github_ama/e0a27v5/)
Should we (GitHub users) expect any big change in the near future because of the planned acquisition?|We are buying GitHub because we like GitHub; our plan is to continue to invest in the GitHub roadmap, and make GitHub better at being GitHub.  The deal won't close until later this year, too, and until then the two companies are separate, and I won't have any influence on what GitHub does.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8pc8mf/im_nat_friedman_future_ceo_of_github_ama/e0a2ddx/)
Hey Nat!  What are your thoughts on the mascot for GitHub (Octocat)?|Her name is Mona, and I think she's incredible, half octopus and half cat.

I really can’t say for sure sweety. I’m not a doctor and I haven’t examined you. What I’m about to say is just my personal opinion: You could be over stimulating your clitoris or you could be putting too much pressure on yourself to orgasm. If it’s something that is really bothering you then I would suggest you speak to your gynecologist. Just try to relax your brain during sex and masturbation and enjoy what’s going on in the moment. I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help my dear.

"I’m a female (22) and I can’t orgasm. I’ve tried toys, masterbation, involving my boyfriend, spicing up our sex life, relaxing my muscles, not thinking about it. 

I’ve done hours and hours of research and have tried everything I fucking can but still can’t cum. 

It’s basically like this amazing build up pressure and then it feels like I’m so fucking close and suddenly it just disappears.. this happens during inter course and by myself 

What’s wrong with me 😭"
So you can't see at all or just blurry ?

Is this a cervix?"
"First, I'm going to say I'm an absolute advocate for both recreational and medical marijuana. This is basically why I'm doing an AMA.

Now to answer your question, I'm going to define an example. We'll say a 25yo male, everything physically being average such as height, weight, metabolism, activity. 

He smokes one joint per day of some chronic, starting today.

He will use ~2500 calories of energy, daily (called basal metabolic rate or BMR) just to keep his heart pumping, brain thinking, body moving, etc. He will intake that same amount of calories to produce a zero sum. This would be perfect homeostasis. When we eat, any leftover energy is stored as fat (anabolized) When we move, some of that fat is metabolized, broken down (Catabolized) back into useable energy. This process is always happening, store, release, store, release, all constantly.

THC-COOH is the main metabolite we look for if we suspect herbal activities. It is, as you correctly stated, lipophilic (fat loving, fat soluble) but it is extraordinary in it's binding ability. Now during this process above, there is constantly a little bit being bound to the fat we're creating and another little bit being released. 

Stick with me here. We all pass the blunt. Those few puffs are enough to saturate his daily fat to 100%. You can't really go over 100% in a day, I mean you can, by changing or adding things like the route of administration, but let's keep this manageable for now. Unfortunately, because of how fat-loving it is, body fat can become super saturated with COOH over time. So he smokes today (and had never before), it's 100%. He smokes tomorrow, nowwwwww it's 200%, the next day 300%, etc, until about 1500% then it becomes harder and harder to saturate. Between 2500 and 3000 percent is the max. 

So for easy math, our dude smokes every day for a month and he's at Max Cap of 3000% but he's ready to quit. So day 0 of quitting body fat saturation is 3000%. We're proud of him for many reasons.

We start working on our logarithmic reduction with this formula, per day: 
CurrentSaturation - (10% of CurrentSaturation) = CurrentSaturation. 
Our example:
Day 1 not smoking: 3000 - (.1*3000) = 2700%.
Day 2: 2700 - (.1*2700) = 2430%. 
Day 3: 2430 - (.1*2430) = 2187%.. and so on
At this rate once he gets down to around 50% he's pretty fucking close to passing. **Disclaimer: He is perfect and lives in perfect world. For you, there is always variability, person to person, genetics, liver function, enzyme production, renal sufficiency, BMI, diet, hydration, RoA, etc.

For this perfect specimen, he hits 50% at exactly day 40 and takes his test. He should be negative. The problem comes in that IF he pops preliminary positive, then the confirmation is a much lower threshold (15%) and in order for him to be able to pass that, he'll have needed to (or should've) waited 52 days.

So, long story short, you can do rough math for anyone whose worried about it. But you're in the ballpark of 45 days for an everyday smoker.

Test at home before someone else tests you. And I can't stress this enough - NEVER take a TEST that you CANNOT PASS. Once someone else tests you, there will forever be a record somewhere that you failed. It's better to decline an offer than to have one rescinded.

TLDR: Pot metabolites love your fat ass. If you are a daily connoisseur for more than a month, don't test for at least a month and a half. And even then start testing at home. Don't go to a lab if you're not sure because you just recorded self-incriminating evidence.

Edit: grammar, structure, vocabulary, cadence. Not content."
"Typically when I tell people that I have antisocial personality disorder the response that I get is almost fear-based. People expect me to be violent or just generally uncaring, but that's not exactly true. I have the capacity for emotion, but my emotions are different than those of most people. Instead of being something that drives my decision making, they are more diminished and ephemeral. I get upset, I get sad, I get happy, but none of these feelings last. It's like living in an emotional flatline, with the occasional uptick. 

I don't care for people typically, I actually find that the majority of people are disappointing and hard to identify with. I understand their motivations, but not their inability to question themselves and their beliefs."
"GitHub today has an acceptable use policy that prohibits illegal content and asks that users treat each other with respect. I’d expect it to continue to have this kind of policy after close of the deal. I haven’t looked at this issue closely yet, however.

"I've recently been listening to a lot of 1970s progressive rock, king crimson and the like. I just find it really awesome in a biblical sense"
"My diagnosis was very recent, actually. I took a 400 question evaluation with my psychologist. 

Typically the markers are things that look mostly innocent (maybe that's the wrong word) as a teenager. Things like fire-starting, defiance, anger problems, risky behavior, law/rule breaking. I'm not proud of certain aspects of my conduct disorder (hurting animals) but when I look back at them I can understand why I did them in the moment. Everything seems rational and irrational simultaneously. 

I have very few actual relationships. I have professional and personal ties, sure, but the vast majority of them don't mean much to me. It's honestly a really lonely experience. 

I don't currently have any of the behavioral symptoms that I mentioned before. It's more of an inability to understand what most people find important, and a sense of morality that is more ecological than societal. 

I'm actually a student now. I'm studying Biology, but I specialize in Herpetology.

Thanks for your question!"

"I don't believe in true altruism. I think that feeling good is a benefit that people get from helping. Altruism by definition is performing a beneficial act for someone else without experiencing any benefit for yourself. If you feel good about it, or tell anyone about it, or feel better about yourself because of it, it's not true altruism. You did a nice thing, and that's great, but I don't personally think that's altruism. "
"I agree (and so does everyone else who uses GitHub). I'm not familiar with the exact plans, but this is a clear area for us to invest in in the future."
Sounds like a pretty appropriate reaction.
"Hi Nat, thanks for doing the AMA.

I was in an internship at SUSE on the very project you started. One of my first real lessons in programming was when someone on the team showed me the concept of [coding fearlessly](http://cam.ly/blog/2010/12/code-fearlessly/) . I had the opportunity to run git blame on code you wrote, even heard a lot of stories about you. Good ones. When I was talking with people I admire there, you had legendary status.

In short, even if you don't know it, you were a big influence throught the things you did. I learned a lot. Especially the crazy methods like ""faster than squeezing oranges for juice"". When you hear so many good things about someone, from people who teach you, you sort of get the feeling that you would like to meet that person. Especially since at SUSE, I missed you by a week or two.

My question: If I were to visit GitHub offices one day, would you be willing to meet up?

PS: Andre, Andy, Balazs, Bamboo, Cornelius, David, Flavio, Garrett, James (bear), James, Matt, Micha, Miguel a warm hello if you are reading this. Thank you for everything you thought me."
"I do write some code, mostly Python in VS Code today. I did a chunk of the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) ML class last year, and write some personal tools regularly to do things like manage my photos and files, or analyze data I'm interested in.

You mentioned feeling lonely sometimes in an earlier comment. Do you have any want to be in a relationship? Would you be able to be emotionally present for one?
"We built GVFS to make it possible for the Windows team to switch to Git, which they have done successfully (yes, Windows is now built on the version control system that Linus Torvards invented!).

Windows is a huge codebase (\~300GB, \~4M files) and extremely actively developed codebase. Git has a bunch of operations which scale linearly with the size of the codebase, so we developed GVFS to help Git perform better in these extreme scenarios.  

We’ve started building macOS support for GVFS with the help of the Office team in Microsoft: [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/03/15/gvfs\-for\-mac/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/03/15/gvfs-for-mac/).  And we’ve actually been working with GitHub for a while to build GVFS for Linux (It would be easier if we could use FUSE, but unfortunately the performance isn't good enough).

I understand that GitHub is hiring for this, so if it’s something that you’re interested in, check out [https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1121642](https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1121642)."

Hey Nat! Here's a free (obvious) idea: consider adding the possibility of requesting paid PRs -- I'd love to slap a reward tag on a project issue and whoever submits a working PR for it gets the reward in his or her account after it's approved. This would be killer and empower the OSS community.
You’re very original
"Microsoft has a history of kitchen sink products. GitHub is fairly minimal and ultra developer focused.

Personally I worry that over time, especially with a focus on enterprise sales, more and more one\-off features will get added in, because they help sell enterprise contracts (tick a box for an executive sponsor). Are there any plans with regard to product ownership in GitHub to keep it from becoming a kitchen sink?"
Oh god I hope not lol. 
"FWIW, the infamous “cancer” comment was made well before my time at Microsoft, and it does not represent my views, Satya’s views, or the views of 60,000 Microsoft engineers who use open source software every day. 

I understand that you are skeptical. I've been here for two years, and in that time I've seen Microsoft rapidly transforming into an open source company. I would ask that you judge Microsoft by its recent actions, by the structural way we are setting up GitHub to run independently and to be an open platform, and by our actions in the future.

I'm also happy to talk to you directly. DM me on twitter if you want to chat."
Of course! DM me on twitter next time you're in SF.

"Microsoft has learned some hard (expensive) lessons about this type of acquisition. Acquisitions under the current Microsoft leadership have a good track record – Minecraft and LinkedIn are examples where Microsoft acquired a successful platform, provided the companies with the resources they needed to accelerate, then let them continue to operate independently. It's working well."
GitHub was obviously an early adopter of Rails and the team has done an incredible job of scaling their stack to being one of the largest sites on the internet (#34 in the US on Alexa). There are no plans to replatform GitHub.
That would be great

"I'm a long time GitHub supporter with a paid account.  

I can't think of a time when Microsoft has done the moral thing over the profitable thing when given the choice.  

I don't trust Microsoft.  [Their failure to provide trustable crypto in Skype is a massive red flag.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data) Willingness to work with the NSA behind doors and beyond the oversight of the American public is disgraceful.  There's nothing to stop Microsoft from doing the same with GitHub with my private repositories.  

Microsoft has a long history of being hostile to the open source community, mocking us as weak and [calling us cancer](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/).  Only as the open source community seriously jeopardised Microsoft's future, as Linux won in the datacenter, mobile, and consumer electronics, did we see a change of attitude.  The open source community has forced Microsoft into more reasonable moral action because, simply, we have been winning.  

I've been working the past two days to move everything off of GitHub and when I'm done I'm asking for a refund of my account. 

Could you convince me that Microsoft understands it's past, serious transgressions and is now going to fight for the developer as a moral agent before profits?"
"I would say condoms are very effective when used correctly. I’m 27 and use the same method as you. I can’t have hormones because of family medical history. If you’re super concerned and don’t want to have a baby right now I would add pulling out to your BC regimen as well (meaning he still wears the condom but pulls out before he ejaculates). Also, make sure he holds the condom to the base of his penis while he’s pulling out to make sure that it doesn’t fall off inside of you. "
"I've often heard it said that sociopaths are unable to feel altruism, that is, feeling good just by being good to other people with no greater reward. Is this true for you?

"I wouldn’t be worried per say, but I would definitely call your gynecologist and make an appointment. There could be a bunch of reasons why your period has stopped. For example stress can wreak havoc on a woman’s cycle. But to be sure and safe I would go in for a checkup or at least call and see what they think. "
"GitHub has been successful in large part because of its product philosophy, and we intend to continue that.

I also think that developers want the same approachability, friendliness, and ease no matter what work they're doing. Of course, large\-scale projects do have unique needs, and GitHub's extensibility and in particular their Marketplace give customers a way of growing up into more sophisticated scenarios over time. "

Hi Nat! Welcome to GitHub! I only have one simple question: Is a hotdog a sandwich?
"All the fucking time. And this used to be a legitimate claim. However, now, all opiates and opioids, except morphine, can be differentiated with GC/MS and LC/MS for their metabolites (for example, so far ONLY heroin can be metabolized into 6-mono-acetyl-morphine). And to exonerate poppy seeds from morphine, the cutoff level has been increased from 300 ng/ml to 2000 ng/ml in urine. A 7x fold increase. That equates to roughly 6 ounces of poppy seeds. So, the burden is on you to prove your eating that many muffins. And if you are, then you should worry more about your cholesterol and blood sugar, then a false positive piss test."

"Without English, I would have been stuck with Korean. But, thanks to English, I changed the way I look at everything.
For example, I can get a lot of information through sites in English than sites in Korean when I don't know a specific thing. Compared to my Korean friends, I can search for information far faster and efficiently. Plus, I don't have to worry about English as a subject in school, whereas my friends have a real hard time trying to memorize 25 vocab words a day."

"I would view her as a hypocrite for feeling bad for the dog and not for the opossum smashed to bits and left to decay on the side of the road 30 feet away. It's not a popular thought, but we love only those animals that we are taught to love, and many others are subjected to much worse. "
"I taught myself to deepthroat. Someone tried telling me that if I force a penis all the way in my throat like that, that it can break my throat or something. Can anything like that happen? I never was really too concerned but they freaked me out. I seen a lot of deepthroating in porn, to the point where you can see the bulge in a woman's throat. They were telling me that the throat isn't shaped to fit something that straight and hard down there without moving or breaking.

Yeah so now I'm kinda freaked out that this shit can hurt me or something, but I enjoy doing it and my boyfriend enjoys it from his end too (duh.) 

Is there anything harmful that deepthroating or extreme deepthroating can cause? Should I stop???"

The world must be a very different place without the emotional filters we prescribe to them and I think people miss the point of this AMA when they argue with you over your perceptions rather than try to comprehend them.

I am in a long term relationship with someone on the mild end of the sociopath spectrum.  I myself am a highly emotional person, so having his unfluctuating base line has been stabilizing for me.  I get the sense he has to act like many things affect him/he cares about them to give off some kind of averageness.  Do you also have to pretend to be more invested in things/feel different than you do in day to day life with others to sort of ""keep the peace"" or avoid the hassle of explanation?"
Rn_delivers is correct. The cervix moves to different positions during different times of a women’s cycle.

"Dealt with long distance (Florida /Norway) for 4 years. It was honestly... Kinda like drowning 24/7. It sucks. So much.

 Tips and advice: be open with each other to keep made-up jealousy away. This works by respecting your significant other to be honestly in love with you. By being opening, I don't mean asking or telling your love if they have a particularly good looking person around in their daily life... You will obsess over the smallest remarks about an opposite sexed colleague or acquaintance. This is what ruins these relationships. The made-up illusion of cheating and lying which causes hurt and confusion for both parties.

Also... Pull out your friend hat. You will be spending a lot of time talking and this will be (quite often) without any sexual feelings. (which is easier to have thrown in while physically together).

My husband and I are very happy together after 10 years. (6 married).. More than happy, couldn't live without each other. We have one 5 year old son and a girl who's due any day now. I think the years of long distance helped us learn how to trust and respect each other. Not that I wish a long distance relationship onto anyone. 

I also want to say... It's completely normal to feel awkward around each other when you do meet up during months apart.

(advice comes from my experience and my sister's... We both fell in love with Europeans while still young and studying) 

Smiles and well wishes!
