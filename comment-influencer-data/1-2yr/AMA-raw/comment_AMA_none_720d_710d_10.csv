What is your favorite holiday?
"September 11th, 2001"
"The lifestyle is pretty sweet. There are these parties that I can't really get much in to that's exclusive to license holders. Basically got me laid. Fun fact: Shaq is bigger in person.

One day I was reading my bank statement, and thought to myself: ""fillet-o-phil, you have way too much money. Get rid of some of that money"" and I was like ""yeah"". Drugs, gambling, freemium - all these vices weren't enough to fill the void that I wanted to create in my wallet. I needed something special.

When people see that you own it, they don't see someone who owns a piece of software, or even somebody with poor judgement and financial responsibility. They see somebody who has the good character to support developers of software they use every day, and disposable income to throw around.

As for your question about registered vs. unregistered versions... The unregistered versions do encourage you to register. It's hard to explain, but you'll notice it when you actually try using the unregistered version.

Do I consider myself a hero? Absolutely."
"Going to class, feeling pretty great. Looking up networking events, working on landing a good job after graduating rather than getting depressed about my prospects feels a lot better. I was going to quit without even really playing, I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt."
What's your favorite thing to do to children?
"Would you rather save Jews from the Holocaust, or children from cancer."
About how many gallons of semen have you consumed in the past 5 years?
None. Hate them all
"I take off my pants, let's combine our forces."
Murder or rape.
"Just your mom.

She's free to leave tho.

She just doesn't. "
Wow. Um. Never been asked this before. 314.
What was the main point of cancer?
What if secretly I'm an escort and is charging her 1$ more than her rate. 
Blocky and black. Really hard.
I'd be over the moon. Probably start a business.
"How would you feel if you woke up one day and went to take a piss, but instead of urine, lego bricks started shooting out of your urethra?"
How would you describe your first sexual experience? 
Gather sympathy.
Adderall confirmed
What's your secret fetish?
Anything with fish
"Horrendously. I've had depression since I was 18 and been pretty up and down since then. I found prostitution was a very dangerous decision that lead me to be being on a huge high and confident and reckless to being in a very, very dark, bad place. I actually left the adult industry in terrible debt. The high times, the money was spent on material items and throwing big parties. At the lows, I couldn't leave the house or face opening my post. And when I couldn't face working, I had no income for weeks on end so got behind on bills. 

I've been out of it for 3 and a half years now and opening this account is a healing project. It's healthy to talk about my experience and although my partner knows and dealt with it, its a hugely taboo subject and we never mention it. Overall, I think the whole experience was incredibly damaging to my self worth and I would stress to any young girl, that even if you think you are strong enough emotionally to handle it and it's only for money for college or whatever, don't. Just don't. "
"Capital punishment. But, worse. I don't know how though."
"If someone made a movie about your life, who do you think would most accurately portray you on screen? "
What if she‚Äôs still charging you and hits you with a massive bill?
"Tell us about the elite lifestyle that comes with owning this.

Are you successful in life?
Do you pay your taxes?
Do you get a shirt?

&amp; lastly, what's the differences you've found between the unregistered version to the bought version?"
The loss of innocence. 
Like the Voltron of shitting. 
Donald J. Trump
My son just stepped on my toes and laughed about hurting his daddy. How should I react?
How often do you walk around with a buttplug?
I don't want to answer questions about that. Lets focus on the film people.
"When you wake up and just want to be normal! You want to wear your comfies and watch tv. But you have to put your make up on and your lacy underwear and summon energy to be sexy and alluring and entertaining and articulate and friendly when that door opens. 

Emotionally, that's tough. More draining than the actual sex acts. It's that facade you have to have when you turn up to a job "
"Really difficult. It's a whole way of life, earning fast cash on demand. I gave it up because I met my current partner and my life priorities completely shifted. For the first year, my finances were fucked. I worked at an estate agents for ¬£18k so adapting to a modest monthly wage was just hideous. There were times I was actually tempted to tap up a regular for a quick ¬£200 because I was so broke. Obviously now, I feel horrible I even considered that.

Now, I work in a law firm as a legal secretary and I'm taking a CILEx course to become a lawyer. I also do occasional pianist accompaniment work for kids and play at weddings and teach a couple of kids piano lessons "
What's your favourite website to buy drugs and sex slaves?

Bangcock?
Can you point on this doll where the Minecraft spider touched you?
A quiet back street or a walking path
"HAha literally ""a lot more time on your hands"""
What do you think symbolises your passion for necrophillia? Where do you dump the bodies after you are done?
Do you think holocaust was deserved?
"As a kid it was harder and more annoying to deal with but as I got older I became more used to it. I find that the worst part was high school when I people would say homophobic things around me not knowing my situation. A lot of people talk about how hard it is coming out (I'm in no way saying I had it more rough) but they don't think about how hard it can be for family members to tell others about a homosexual relative, especially if it's a parent. I'm extremely open about it now and that was due to the fact that I finally posted a Facebook status my senior year explaining my families situation and the amount of support I got from my classmates was amazing. "
Oof
"I'm thinking about getting into abducting small children.  Based on your experience, do you have any suggestions on where to dump bodies?"
Are you aware of /r/paidforwinrar ?
Yup
"Bad in what sense? There were a lot of 'Bad clients', either hygeinicially or in their behaviour. There were only one or two occasions where I walked out. One was where i was hired to see a very young 18 year old. His friends had hired me and he clearly was not 100% consensual. The other was in the brothel when a client blindfolded me then inserted a sex toy inside me he had brought with him. For hygiene reasons that is completely unacceptable"
"Only in that there have been a couple of times I have recognised people and thought ""are you.."". 

I had a bad experience where a particularly keen, regular client saw me walking home a year or so after I had left the business. He pulled over to talk to me then followed me to see where I was living now. It was horrendous. "
I much prefer vanilla actually
Pulp Fiction. By far.
"Like fire, a volcano maybe?"
No one can say no to a good tip.
How many people do you have captive in your basement?
"Such aggression.

You constipated bro? "
When did the murders start? 
"Well that‚Äôs the real problem then. Porn only ruins your life when you feel guilty about it.

Porn isn‚Äôt the problem. Restricting beliefs are."
"Lol yes she knows, it was mostly her inviting me out as stuff, she even bought me a really great birthday gift "
What if any sandwich would you recommend not eating from a vending machine?
What movie do you believe contains the best life lessons?
What would it take to get you to eat cereal out of my asshole 
"Oh man. I had a friend back in Junior high who's birthday was September 11th. I always felt really bad for her after 2002, what a conflicting day it must be for her. "
"Oh dear God OP, you're a savage. This tells me everything I need to know about the shirt thing. "
You always go from the head down. Minimizes time.
"Damn, that one wasn't even edited."
What is your favorite thing to use as a dildo and how many times do you let your mother use it beforehand?
"So you got friendzoned by a prostitute, lol"
High school
I fell asleep with Hilary in the lead then woke up a few hours later to find out Trump won. Does that count? lol
I'm no hero. I put my big boy pants one one leg at a time. The real heroes are the brave men and women of the LAPD who helped influence my character for Rampart.
Does she know you're also friends or does she think she's still working? 
"I dont know. I wish I knew. Just before, I was in quite a controlling relationship where he was repeatedly unfaithful. I think half of it was a 'fuck you' and a need to verify myself as desirable but I'll never know for sure what the hell made me do it. I applied to work at the brothel then before I knew it, I'd had photos taken and was in for a shift the next night and it just went from there."
Yes! So much yes!!! üôåüèΩ
"It's an act. It's not just sex, the minute the door opens you're acting. There's that time before you go to the bedroom where you have to make conversation and be attractive and seem like you want to be there! "
That's why I marked it NSFW. I didn't write the first comment.
I don't pick favorites. Last time I did my house got burned down.
"You apply for it. 

There are a whole lot of food safety courses and you can get various food science degrees.

In my case, I happened upon it, essentially.  My last job (potato chip company) was looking for someone to get some food safety certifications for the company and I was selected to spearhead the project (I worked in the office at the time).  I didn't know then the rabbit hole I was tumbling down but I ended up going to classes to be certified in things like HACCP, SQF standards, internal auditing, etc.   Then (years later), I was called by a recruiter for this company to help them improve their food safety plans and systems.

Basically I combine my 'industry knowledge' with regulatory requirements (USDA, FDA, etc.) and make sure that our programs and procedures are sufficient and then make sure that we're actually DOING the things we say in the plant.   

Also, making sure the turkey is sitting on the bun properly."
Falling down and scraping my knee on a storm drain
Yeah...women stripping is totally allowed. It's just them driving we had a problem with. 
That‚Äôs a good question. Pickles and 1.
What animal tastes the best?
Ouch
"Ayo this isnt a question but just dont do it dude. Everyone has potential but by ending your life you're doing nothing but cutting that potential out. Everything gets better, it's just a matter of time."
"It‚Äôs a nice sunny day and I took a nap in Central Park to enjoy it. I‚Äôm not out of potential yet, or things to enjoy."
"My dad's partner has been around since I can remember so I do look at him as a parental figure. But he is also younger than my dad so when I was a kid I almost looked as him as a friend. He also doesn't like how my mom and step dad look at them and this side of my family but he is also an extremely kind person so he keeps his opinions to himself and doesn't try to bad mouth about my mom or step dad. My biological father is from NY so he doesn't care who hears his opinion haha.  Also, my dad and his partner have been a lot more supportive of my career choice and constantly challenge me to be different and more creative. "
"If you met the Queen of England, how would you greet her?"
