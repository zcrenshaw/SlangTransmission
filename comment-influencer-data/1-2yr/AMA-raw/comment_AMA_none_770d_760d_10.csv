When I went dress shopping there I told them my price range and that I wouldn't budge at all. A lady found me a dress that I loved and promised me it was on sale. I tried It on and loved It. It wasn't on sale. I was so upset. That exact same thing happened to my sister. (My sister caved and spent the money. I didn't and found something better. ) was this something you were pushed to do? Did you enjoy any part of working there?
Aaaaaaand time to get off Reddit for the day. Nothing against you!! Love what you're doing!! Although know what I know about sadists. You've probably talked to a few murderers. 
I like that honesty that definitely earns an upvote
"I'm so sorry that happened to you! I definitely hated the fact that I was often encouraged to not even ask for a price range and was even told a few times to bring over at least one dress from the most expensive designer for each appointment. 
If I had to choose one aspect of the job that I did like, it was when I had the opportunity to get to know the bride. When it was just the two of us, in the room, and she had the opportunity to tell me how she really felt about the dress, or she told me her backstory, or just any conversation I could have with her before I had to return to my manager who only spoke to me to complain about how much I wasn't selling."
"You live alone, I take it"
"I hated the fact that we are supposed to push customers to buy, buy, buy! I was told repeatedly to ignore the bride's price range, and my manager even yelled at me once for refusing to push the sale onto a woman whose mother passed away the day before. The prices aren't so bad; they even have sales multiple times a year when dresses go for as little as $99. But, at the end of the day, David's is only after your money. Stylists are made to feel ashamed if they don't sell around $2,000 per shift. Take your future wife to a local shop, perhaps. One that isn't a huge corporation that only wants your money rather than your bride's complete satisfaction. Hope I answered your questions well!"
"I've been waiting to tell this story ever since it happened, and now I finally can! 
So, I used to have this one manager (she left a few months ago; she now manages her own store elsewhere) and she was... intense. Pressured you to make the sale no matter what, made you feel stupid for messing something up, liked to talk about other workers behind their backs, etc. We are going to refer to her as Tiffany.
One day, I had a woman come in with her sister, and she wanted to try on bridal gowns. Awesome! I was more than happy to help them out. Fast-forward about an hour, and we've finally found the dress that she loves and wants to wear down the aisle. She starts tearing up a bit, which is expected when you find your wedding dress, but then the tears get heavier and she begins to cry as though she is sad. Obviously I back off and do not try to push the sale. She goes back into the room to change. Her sister looks at me and says, ""I'm so sorry. Our mother just passed away yesterday and she was supposed to come to this appointment with us. We didn't cancel because our mother wouldn't have wanted us to put our plans on hold; she would have wanted us to carry on. But now I'm seeing that it wasn't such a good idea. I'm so sorry."" 
Wow. My heart broke.
Obviously, I responded by saying I was so sorry that this had happened to them, the bride most definitely does not have to make any decisions today, and she can come back whenever she feels like she's ready and we'll look at her favorite dress again some other time. 
The party leaves, after thanking me for being patient. Tiffany asks me, ""What did you do wrong? Why didn't you close the sale?"" 
I responded by telling her that the customer's mother passed away yesterday and she was still very upset about it, so I didn't want to make things difficult on her by adding the pressure to buy a dress. 
I kid you not, Tiffany looks me dead into the windows of my soul and says, ""Well, the sale ends tomorrow, so, congrats; you just missed your opportunity."" 
I couldn't believe my ears. That was the moment I realized I had to get out of there.
Sorry this wasn't a happier story! "
"I worked at DB for one day once years ago.  I was told the job would be in receiving, shipping, back office stuff.  First thing they did was shove me on the sales floor.  I remember the meeting before opening being the saddest thing. All the salesladies were complaining they didn't have enough time to keep up their sales books and the manager said ""just come in on your own time. Days off, whatever."". The sad part then was how excited they all were that they could do that.  They all seemed fairly miserable and I know I was so I quit.  Glad you got out."

What were the core fundamentals of the cult? Like what were their beliefs and did they have structures to follow it so what?

However, the program opened first for those who already live in the Far East (there are some big cities there and that's quite a lot of people) and they took the best plots before other Russians got the right to choose one.

"I worked there for almost a year. The pay had the potential to be good, but good pay was almost impossible to reach. 
A stylist makes minimum wage, which is $8.25. A specific stylist will only be scheduled around three times a week, for maybe four hours each shift. However, each stylist has the chance to make commission on their sales. So, the managers said that we ""decide what our paychecks will be"" through selling. 
The percentage of commission that a stylist could receive is very low, although any time I asked a manager, they explained it in such a complicated way that I never got a straight answer. I never reached the point where I could receive commission anyway because I was never able to sell thousands of dollars of merchandise in my three to four hour shift. So, I would only be paid minimum wage for four hours, three times a week. I was taking home paychecks in the amount of $150 for two weeks because I refused to push customers to buy an expensive dress that they weren't 100% certain they wanted to buy."

"She eventually followed us to [smalltown-of-grandpa] and met a military man. 

Honestly she ended up a bit weird in the head and developed I want to say a form of hypochondriac tendencies. It's very sad. She has diagnosed my brother with Lyme, she tried to diagnose my child with multiple diseases while she was still within my womb, she is constantly diagnosing my disabled sister with all sorts of things. She has formed an obsession with disease and I think, really, if she would just see a psychiatrist and face her issues with the past we had together, this would end. "

"This is tough because while I understand the feeling of never being able to pursue your attraction fully, it's not an excuse at all. In any way, ever.

In fact it probably makes me more angry than regular people, since I **do** understand what it's like, and I worked hard to come to terms with the fact that I need to keep that attraction **out** of real life. I have no idea what kind of mental gymnastics you have to do to rationalise that raping/molesting someone (of any age) is ever okay. The worst part is that they use pedophilia as an excuse for not being able to control themselves, which are two separate things. Ultimately it just makes people demonise and misunderstand pedophiles even more. I don't want to be associated with rapists, because I'm not one of them."
I had a man call me yesterday who wanted me to watch him torture his dick. He wanted to bleed for me. He stuck a pencil in it without lube. Pierced it with needles straight through. We talked while he did it and he liked showing that side of him. I like how he was open about it with me and trusted me enough to share that side of him. We talked in length on why he enjoys it and how it got started so it was weird and interesting.

Has your accident changed your outlook on afterlife/religion?
"This is really what messed up my whole idea to religion growing up, even now in my adult life. Great question. 

Now when I really think back on it, rather than before when I would resonate within it, their core fundamentals were almost mindless or constantly in contradiction.

They would follow biblical verses, but also implement their own verses and make us repeat them constantly. Always about the devil... primarily.... how woman is often the devil but disguised. I was/am one of the disguised. 

So we were all expected in our daycare and bible studies to do exercises that they believed to allow us to picture our own auras, channel our spirits and connections, but also detect bad spirits around us. We are animals, and we have instincts (basically), so finding all the demons and devils is the goal. It was like a combination of being in tune with nature and LOOK AT HER SHE IS THE DEVIL IN THE FLESH!! 

it really seems like a peaceful chaos

They never (at least while during my time there) had apocalyptic expectations. They truly just spent their time trying to filter out what they considered evil or good. They did do weird ass rituals though and that whole thing just confuses me. 

""But Eva has been punished by the burden of giving life to man with great pain, and with the burden of sharing her sorrow and mistake as she pushes them through the womb. The poison has spread for all women to come, but select few have been kissed by Lucifer.""

Basically eve has punished all women because of her poison apple to always burden themselves with the pain of child birth and man should always live happily and pain free and sometimes the devil will choose a child to walk the earth and test us further to hurt us more and blah blah we need to try and avoid the devils baby 

edit: which was me...."

"I'm the father of a 20 year old trans woman. She came out to me 4 years ago when she just turned 16. In answer to your questions:

I did not foresee at all.

It wasn't difficult to accept her at all. It was hard to remember to refer to her as a girl at first. I thought I knew my first born child so well. Knew her as- well, who she had always been to that point. I loved her for everything she was. When she revealed to her stepmother and I that she felt she was a girl, it wasn't a question of accepting her, just hard to make my mind (full of a lifetime of memories of watching her grow up and not knowing she thought of herself as a girl) adjust and remember that she was no longer he.
It would upset her at first, until I had a heart-to-heart with her. I told her I loved her and that I was trying. We all were. We were in her corner all the way, but she had to give us time to adjust and get used to using the correct pronouns. She did, and we did.

Nobody that I know of in my family has been negative towards her in any way. Its been pretty much accepted.

Where I live, the surgery is covered. One of the workers in the plant I work in is trans and just returned to work from her surgery. Having said that, I would certainly support ~~her~~ my daughter in other ways, financial and otherwise.

Thanks for the questions. I feel for the trans people who don't have support of family. I love my daughter very much and I'm always behind her.

In fact I forget to tell a thing, since the crash I'm sure that god doesn't exist as heaven and hell because I never see St Peter or the queue for hell or heaven.

The first weeks after the crash I had to believe in something because the doctors said it was a miracle if I was still here, I was asking myself if I was in a new dimension also. I believed, because me and my mother liked the idea, that my grand-father who died in 1992 didn't want me with him and kick my face when he saw me and send me back to earth. "

Good question. It definitely tempting at times to just keep doing what I'm doing and save/invest. I could live really well that way but I think I'd eventually get bored. It sounds cliche as hell but I've wanted to be a doctor since I was young and I really feel it's what I'm meant to do.

"It's honestly amazing how people think cults are mostly a thing of fiction or things of the past. 

Im willing to bet the cult from your story is still out there. One of my very best friends dated a girl in a cult, but he just thought it was a very strict church. She ended up changing him in a bad way for a long time. He even wrote a book about it. 

The trouble with cults is that they don't even believe they are cults. They're just very strict in their faith. And they have amazingly manipulative ways of bringing people in and keeping them in. 

There are specialists out there for these kinds of things. So if anyone sees a friend getting sucked in, give someone a call. There are tons of people to help. "

"so basically since i was a kid i'd just have a really vivid imagination and could throw a toy up and down for 8 hours whilst thinking about anything, from a soccer game to a formula one race, to like running a country and starting a war haha. If i watched something i liked i'd just stay in my room and create a story. and because of that i developed this insane ability called ""hyperfocus"" and could follow one line of thought for a really long time. But when i was in class my brain was doing 10,000 things. kind of like having 25 TV's in a 5 x 5 grid all playing different things and trying to focus on one thing. so basically all of school from year 1-12 i didn't learn a thing, but because i was learning alot in day to day life my grades were always pretty good with next to no effort. Also if i learnt something interesting i'd never forget it. 

But school was boring as shit. However this year i started medicine, and the content was super interesting, and i began reading a lot, so i was using my ""hyperfocus"" to essentially learn content. And i'd have to learn it from the most rudimentary level in order to understand it completely. And before i knew it i was filling out white boards with an insane level of biochemical physics equations and could draw out the entire thoracic cavity and label it to an extent that not even surgeons can. And i was getting every single nitty gritty little detail, cause for the first time i was enjoying what i was learning. And we had a first exam in which the average was 35 and i got 85, without trying or revising, but i predicted i'd get 85 because i knew exact amount of questions i got right, and the ones i got wrong were ones i'd never learnt. And basically the year level coordinator was like ""how do you know so much"" and i answered really innocently, ""I read it in a book."" And that was how it came about. But i've also massively improved in chess and piano and a whole host of other stuff this year cause i'm finally out of the house and the routine of high school. Can be classed as an ""autistic sauvant."" Hope that answers your question

But from an outwards perspective i just don't pay much attention to whatever is happening infront of me unless i'm engaged in a conversation. And it came up by me accidently learning a medical specialty in a week lol, and correcting a surgeon in class. "
"I once had a plus-size customer come in to find a wedding dress. She was absolutely gorgeous, she was kind and polite, etc. She was going to be a joy to work with, I could already tell. 
Her mother was a different story. 
Every time my bride came out of the room in a new dress, her mother would say such rude things like ""That isn't flattering on your stomach at all. You need to hide that."" 
So rude. 
We got into the dressing room and my bride just started crying. I felt so bad for her. Here she was, this beautiful and kind woman, in tears because her mother wouldn't shut up about her weight. 

Another time, (this happened to a different stylist but I was there) this mother of the bride came in and she was looking for a dress. She walked around the entire store, and every dress she saw, she had something bad to say about it. ""That's ugly!"" Or ""That looks tacky!"" 
I'll admit, some of the dresses were less than beautiful. But this lady was shouting, loudly, about how much she hated every dress. Every time her daughter came out of the fitting room in a new dress, she would say ""That color is hideous on you."" We tried to explain that we already knew what color we'd have to order in, but right now we're just trying on for size, not color. So don't worry, the dress won't be this color. It will be in a different one when we order it and it comes in. The correct one that the bride wants. And the lady was like, ""I know. I was just saying the color is ugly."" 

Yet another time, a grandmother of the groom told me in detail about the way in which she wanted to pass away: peacefully in her sleep. 
I mean, me too, ma'am. But I wasn't planning on talking about it today inside this changing room. Lol"
"Yeah, that's how it works. It's also nice in a way as there isn't much population in the Far East and many people do intend to move there now. This may have some positive effect on the economy of these regions and so on."

"I agree with this. I struggled with depression most of my life, even now. 17 was a really bad age for me. 18 was worse, 19 was even worse, and 20 was breaking point. At 21 I decided to start working out and it completely turned my entire life around. 14 years later, I still workout 5 to 6 days a week and it fights depression much more than anything else. It also gives you confidence and makes you feel good about yourself. If I had never started working out, I wouldn't have any of the things I have. Hell, I might not even be here."

"I immediately cut ties with any potential client I perceive to be quick to anger or overly jumpy. I also don't tolerate guys who try to hustle me for a lower rate. Those are the two most common red flags I see. Less of an issue but still a concern are guys who seem really, truly lonely. Sometimes they get too attached and that can be a problem. 

The biggest red flag experience I had was a guy I met for a day drink and when I got up to use the restroom he followed me in and practically demanded I take my clothes off so we could have sex right then and there. It was pretty fucked up and needless to say I didn't call him back."
