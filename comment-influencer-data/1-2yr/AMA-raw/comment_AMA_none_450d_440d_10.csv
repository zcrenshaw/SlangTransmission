My dad beat his ass.
"Yes, my uncle is in jail. I've been taking therapy for about two years."
"School. My mom makes me go to school and it's hard to take care of my little one. Thank God it's summer break for me.

I wish people would stop asking about why I had her/what happened. I didn't want it to happen but it did anyways. I hate remembering what happened and I'm sensitive to the entire subject."
"you know what? I take it back. I find it repulsive that others tried to help you out of this situation every step of the way, only for you to shit on their assistance. you are incredibly disrespectful, and have riddled it out in your own broken way that drugs aren’t the core issue. you are a textbook example of an addict who refuses to get off of the rollercoaster. I feel for your family, because they are the true victims for helping to support you in any capacity while you singlehandedly make the most dangerous and stupid decisions possible for yourself. you have the audacity to complain about not receiving a card for holidays. the addict entitlement needs to go before you ever have a chance at recovery."
Perspective. 
"I am doing quite well. I am living in a group dorm with about 20 other people which is covered by the company I am working for. The pay is quite a bit less, but everything here is much less expensive, so it all balances out more or less. 

Also, the living as a whole is quite nice. Its nothing fancy, but I have my own room and bathroom, which is all I could really ask for. "
"Everything. Her face, her smile. The way she says ""mama"" whenever she's happy."
"You are, without a doubt, the worst pirate I have ever heard of. "
Is your abuser in jail? Have you started therapy?
If you Venmo me 11$ I’ll eat a box of crayons (off the record) 
"I was scared so I told them.
They, of course, called the police."
"I mean, nothing special. I'm in college, and have a job there, but I was looking to try something different and step out of what is considered normal American life for a summer. I think its going pretty well so far!"
"Her: Nah I really don't. It was in the past and there's good and bad in every race. We gots to start treating each other right.

Me: So you're not mad at them for what their parents did?

Her: (shakes head) I'm just not that type to hold a grudge. I don't like what they did but that's all in the past"
What’s your favorite type of cheese?
!RemindMe 5 years
"the thing is... with addiction, you’re ‘doing alright’ until you’re not. if you are ever interested in truly getting sober, then I will support you. until then, I feel for the people in your life. I’m done arguing reality vs contrived fantasy."
No. I don't want her to know about that fucking asswipe. My dad-his brother- doesn't want him anywhere near her and he's currently in jail.
oh no why is it always the uncle. how did whoevers brother he is of react? 
What's the hardest thing about being a teen mum? What do you wish people would understand?
How the hell did someone even *hold* seven guns? 
"Up until this point, it never dawned on me that at least one person out there MUST have the full collection

"
":(

You are a strong girl and I know it's hard but one day, it's all gonna be worth it. You will feel like you're not good enough, that you're a failure but trust me, it will all be OK.

Don't let being a teen mum define you and the things that has happened to you. "
"Not a question, but I just wanted to comment on how strong you are! People are so quick to judge, and you should not have to reveal personal details just for them to back off. I wish you and your daughter the best!"
Indeed.

well rightfully so
"I heard Chinese workers work for 5 years, save up money, then leave to rural areas to farm and live with family for the rest of their lives. Is that at all true? Thanks for posting btw. "
"Wow thanks I’m cured. 

I take drugs recreationally these days. Recreational drug use is okay in my book. I’m doing perfectly well for myself, I’m living comfortably and I have a job. I see my dad most evenings and we often meet up for a pint after work. I just went to a family event and had a great time with everyone. You have some strange scenarios playing out in your head. There’s no reason to get this angry about something that you have no control over. Chill out man and thanks for the concern. I’m doing alright though and I also take drugs every now and then. Lock me up and throw away the key. 

I didn’t touch anything for about 9 months after release. Drugs aren’t the answer to your problems but you actually can use the to have fun if you’re careful. Try it some day, not meth or heroin. More like ketamine or lsd. Report back to me. "
"Wow, another girl my age. What's the best thing about your daughter?  "
"Me: What advice do you have for someone who just got married? Turns out they're gonna have a baby too.

Her: They got married cause they had a baby?

Me: Don't think so. Hope not.

Her: I'd advise young women try to get married before you have a baby because a baby doesn't make a man love you anymore so don't get pregnant just because you think you can hold on to a man cause he'll leave both you and the baby. Be a strong independent woman. Stand up for your rights

Me: What about for a guy?

Her: Same thing for a guy. It ain't gonna make that woman love you.

Me: Any relationship advice then? Like something you'd tell me if I just got married.

Her: Love one another and respect each other. And if she got a problem talk about it. Very important for you to talk. Sometimes talking it help a lot

(Congratulations by the by)"
"Nothing about a normal romantic relationship is appealing to me. In my opinion, regular relationships seem like a tremendous waste of time. Spoiling beautiful women and seeing them have everything they want because of me is more arousing than anything else I can imagine. "
"They arent really. China as a whole is communist on paper, but in reality they are extremely capitalist. At least that is most apparent at the level I am working."
"Thank you! I work about 9 hours a day, but there are breaks scattered throughout the day so it's not bad at all. I am staying in a workers dorm and it is really a nice place. I'm really not getting any special treatment beyond the limitations that comes with not speaking much Mandarin. I found this job through knowing a guy who knows a guy and so on, and oh yeah, all the workers look at me like quite funny."
Why? 
"I'm from Boston, and am currently in Dongguan."
"I haven’t heard that,  but I’ll get back to you if I find out more."
"My mom and I sometimes fight because she acts like she's her mother, even when I told her she can *help*. I don't want to be extremely dependant. I may be young but I'm able to care for her. I love her."
"♡

One of the nicest things I've heard about this subject. This makes me happy. Thank you, u/constantit. You're amazing."
"Her: Well. Hmmm. Uh. My life and the way i live i just try to help everyone i can and sometimes theres nothing i can do but talk and listen to their problems.

Me: That's your secret?

Her: To live the best life that I can. It gets hard sometimes but granny tries to hang on and do the best she can. And love her family"
"Most people got in my business about it, and I was absolutely not in a good state of mind so I pushed everyone away and cried."
Thats not a coincidence you daft cunt.
"Her: Nah I don't have no jokes

Me: Not even from when you were a kid?

Her: mmm we didn't have a lot of jokes. because when I was a kid we all lived very far apart so we never really saw each other. Granny didn't have a very good childhood"
Maybe she should think about that sometime after 14.
I don’t have a question but this is a really interesting thread. You should tell her thank you for answering all these questions 
"How did your parents find out?

What did they say about it?"
I’m on a water break :)
Fast food. They thought I was stealing because there are food voids that total over 200$ in the past week alone. 
Gotta pay for that runescape subscription some how
"I actually got off fairly easy on this, personally. I only have ever had two serious partners in my life and the second one is now my husband. In both cases I started off simply getting to know them, learning and testing if they were trustworthy people, explaining some of my history with my mother. Eventually when I felt things were going to get physical I sat them down for a serious talk and told them ""You know some of my history with my mother but before we get physical, here are the cold hard facts."" I would explain my status, my treatments, and give them the option to back out because it's obviously a very serious condition and I'm not going to make them stay if they don't want to. Both times they were very understanding, understood it was not my fault, and moved on with our relationship from there with the necessary precautions"
"Her: Nope

Me: They haven't stayed the same?

Her: No nothing's the same. 

Me: How come?

Her: White restraunts nothing. When I was a kid we had to go in through the back. Weren't allowed to go up front. We were supposed to say yes sir no sir to the white folks. To the old white folks and black and white couldn't go to school together. We had to pick cotton chop cotton

Me: They made you do it too?

Her: yeah when I was young. I still had to pick and chop cotton

Me: What about the people. Were they more openly racist than now?

Her: oooh yes 

Edit:

Me: So how were they more openly racist?

Her: I already told ya one way. When I was going we weren't allowed to go to theatres. These restaurants we go in through now we go in the front wasn't allowed. We went to the back and they had a little window for the black folks to order."
"I really loved the German work ethic, culture and health care system. The people are great too, a little cold at first but once you get to know them.... its nothing but love"
"If this is too personal, please don’t feel like you need to answer! I’m a birth doula and a trend I see is younger pregnant women, especially teens, not being taken seriously by their OB-GYNs and in the delivery room. How was your experience with your doctors and nurses? Did you find that they respected your authority and opinions, or did they try to push their own beliefs and not take you seriously because you were young?"
"The biggest thing that can be done with a positive partner is condoms. Condoms condoms condoms. I can't emphasize that enough.

Now in my case, I am a woman, and women are generally at a much lower risk of passing it on to a partner. Something about the viscosity of vaginal fluids dilutes the virus, whereas in sperm, it's very concentrated. I am also undetectable, meaning my viral load is so low its virtually non-existant and I can live an almost normal life and even have unprotected sex with my husband if we choose to and he has about 0.001% chance of becoming infected.

The biggest thing in keeping my viral load under control is I have to take my anti-retroviral drugs religiously. It's dangerous to skip even one dose because the virus can learn and mutate and I can become resistant. Personally I only have to take two pills once a day but when I was growing up it was lots of pills twice a day. I also have to go in every three months for a check-up just to make sure everything is going well and we can adjust what we need to if things are wonky. My husband also gets tested at each of these appointments just in case.

Other than that I actually lead a pretty normal life"
"see ya in 3-5 years when you’re doing an AMA about a stint in some other prison. epic stories bro, totally worth it"
"Yes, but I have had several long lasting relationships where we never engaged in anything sexual. I mostly enjoy taking women out on expensive dates or traveling. Anything beyond that is purely up to the woman and just considered a bonus, in my eyes. "
!Remindme 3 years. 
"My friends love her! I go everywhere with her when I go out. I'm very paranoid and usually I go out with my mom, so I don't leave my little one home alone.

Her favorite place is the park. It's one of the words she's actually pronouncing well, and she'll always tug on my clothes and say ""mama, park!"" "
"That's a good question and I'm honestly glad you asked.

The people who are the worst about it are uninformed older people. My in-laws, for instance, are baby boomers and do not know about me because I'm pretty sure my mother-in-law would literally die on the spot.

I was unaware of my diagnosis until I was 12 years old so I could learn about the virus in an objective way through school before learning about it personally. Unfortunately school, especially some sex ed centers, still teach in a very bigoted, uninformed way, especially when it's abstinence-centered, and when my doctors told me the truth I cried because I thought it was a death sentence.

I also was nearly denied public education when my father disclosed my status to my schools. Many teachers, again of boomer and Gen-X, were grossly misinformed and did not want me to go to school because they thought by just sneezing I would infect my fellow students. Very untrue, and I got lucky that my father and the few educated higher-ups on school boards took my side and argued my case and I was allowed to go to school. My fellow students were not informed and no one was any the wiser.

I've actually encountered the least stigma around people my own age because we are much better informed these days. All my friends are aware of my diagnosis and don't treat me any differently at all. "

---------|----------|----------|
How does the pay and cost of living difference compare to if you were doing the same back in America? Relatively, are you okay, doing well or struggling?  With living arrangements, do you have your own place, or do you share with others? How's the rent &amp; amenities where you are? *(I kind of want to see what living conditions / housing looks like, partly because I'm nosy but also because you only ever see these things on the news when they're reaaaally bad.)*|I am doing quite well. I am living in a group dorm with about 20 other people which is covered by the company I am working for. The pay is quite a bit less, but everything here is much less expensive, so it all balances out more or less.  Also, the living as a whole is quite nice. Its nothing fancy, but I have my own room and bathroom, which is all I could really ask for.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13clh7/)
Good on you for attempting to understand different perspectives. Hopefully you can turn this experience into something worthwhile and not some ""shits and giggles"" type of experience.  How many hours do you work?  Are you staying in a worker dorm?  Do you get the same benefits as the other workers, or any special treatment?  How did you get this job, and did the company look at you funny when you asked to do assembly line work?|Thank you! I work about 9 hours a day, but there are breaks scattered throughout the day so it's not bad at all. I am staying in a workers dorm and it is really a nice place. I'm really not getting any special treatment beyond the limitations that comes with not speaking much Mandarin. I found this job through knowing a guy who knows a guy and so on, and oh yeah, all the workers look at me like quite funny.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13cvr6/)
Why?|Perspective.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13cyzj/)
Where are you living? Are you sharing the space? What do you eat? Do you prepare the food yourself? How much does the food cost? Can you walk us through a day?|I am living in a workers dorm, and a pretty nice one at that! I get my own room and bathroom, and start work at around 8am every week day. All the meals are made by cooking crew and are covered by the company. Besides that, we get three square meals a day and breaks about four times a day. I will usually leave work around 6-7 at night and wind up falling asleep around 10pm. Its hard work, but its quite rewarding.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13cwhm/)
Do you have any trouble keeping up with your coworkers?  How are things in terms of work environment -- ergonomics, bathroom breaks, etc.?|Everything pretty much carries over for the most part. I do find that some of the tables are lower than I am used to (I am 6 feet tall). Luckily they have Western Style toilets, which is a definite plus for someone who grew up in the US. Overall, its not as uncomfortable as you might expect.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13czmt/)
What’s your plan after your contract is up? Are you returning to the US? Work on a new project?|I head back to the US in August to go back to College. Hopefully I will get to come back though!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13d2il/)
Gotten to try any good food?|Honestly, all the food is good. I've come to realize that dishes like ""Lemon Chicken"" or ""Broccoli and Beef"" are way more American than Chinese. I have been eating a lot of Bok Choy, Rice, and Tofu. Love it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13de49/)
where are you from originally (in the us) and where in china are you?|I'm from Boston, and am currently in Dongguan.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13dzk6/)
How is the language barrier? How much Chinese do you need to know to do your job?|Most people under 30 speak pretty good English (or at least enough to get the point across). But realistically, I really only need to know how to say if I need something, the rest can just be said with hand signals and the occasional google translate.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13e30k/)
How is this job compared to jobs you have had in the past? Like work center morale, overall atmosphere? I read that you are there for the summer, so you plan on doing the same thing in the future or trying something else new?|I will likely do something else in the future, although who knows, because I'm really not trying to control anything more than a couple years out. The moral is great. Everyone is working pretty hard for long hours, but they all seem quite content and happy all the time. That being said, I have been more than welcomed by my co-workers. Thanks for the question!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13e3ix/)
on a scale of 10, How boring is the job?|1 being least and 10 being most?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13e7v9/)
Are there really children working on the factories?  What do you assemble?  Is the salary really that low?|There definitely are no children working in these factories. Thats something that was cracked down upon about 20 years ago by the government in China. I assemble 3.5mm headphone cables. The salary is a bit less than half of minimum in the US, but thats really all you need out here, because the cost of living is MUCH lower.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13efhi/)
Have you heard anything about or discussed the current trade war going on between the US and China? This is likely to affect the workers in this factory so I’m curious to know their opinions about it.|I will definitely as them. Its also very possible they don't even know about it. I will let you know.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/8syovy/i_am_an_american_working_on_an_assembly_line_in_a/e13eyme/)

"I only see most of them maybe once a week, and I'll take them out for dinner or to a play or something else along those lines. Most of them also will text/call me when they've purchased something with my money, which I absolutely love and look forward to every day. "
where are you from originally (in the us) and where in china are you?
Thank you! I am incredibly proud of her. Sometimes we call her our little helper because she often hands us things when we need them! I love my baby.
Aah but you have heard of me
"I'm a dad with daughters your age. You're a mother, but clearly still a child...do your parents treat the situation like you're a mother now and this is their grand daughter? Do they defer to your judgement on parenting and and rules for your daughter? How does this mesh with their house rules for your child as well as for you...Or is it more like they have a new child to parent. I think if it were me I would feel like my wife and I had another child and I would find it difficult to let my daughter be the mom. "
Why did you get fired? From what type of job?
"Sorry if this might sound strange, but when your daughter grows up are you going to tell her who her dad is? "
"I'm late to reply to this, but I'm one of those from the other subreddit who was actively trying to help sort things out. I was able to contact people who could help give information on your status/whereabouts, but the most important thing that prevented it was not having your passport information. I'm not sure that we could have done much more than visit or maybe make some deposits in your prison account but at least it would have been something. If you ever do plan on returning, make sure someone has a copy of your passport just in case... Welcome back and happy to hear that this story didn't end as bad as I thought it would!"
I am not interested in getting sober but thanks for the support. Really I can do what the fuck I want with my own life. We could argue all night long about our differences of opinion. I’m not ruining my life like you seem to think I am... yet. I am fully aware how quickly that can change. I’ve had years of therapy and counselling. You don’t need to warn me about that and its always a worry of mine. But I am not living the lifestyle I used to live or take the drugs I used to take. I’m pretty stable and happy at the moment.  What I do on my days off is none of your concern so please just have a good evening. 
"I’ve read all your comments on this post and you seem like a hard line AA cunt. 

The AA method is not the sole and only way for all people. While I’d agree doing serious drugs (stuff that’s not alcohol, weed, mushrooms, or occasional lsd) is not great when you know you have a tendency toward addiction, you could stand to be less of a judgmental prick to some stranger on the Internet.  Get your own shit sorted before you claim you would “support” others. "
Why?  Wouldn't it make sense to just have girlfriends like most guys do?  It seems like a tremendous waste of money.  You can have hook ups and casual relationships and save yourself some cash.
Get back to work 
"Understood, no worries!"
"Interesting question! I had really gained a deeper respect for the the work of the Chinese work force. The people here work pretty long hours but really have a passion for good work. I guess mostly it has really helped me appreciate some of the luxuries I’ve been blessed with back in the US. That’s not to brag, just a level of appreciation. Thanks for asking!"
That's so awesome. You must be very proud of her. Just remember that she's yours and you have incredible strength to have a kid this young (and still going to school!) I hope you and Addison have a great summer. :)
Yes I am making this all up
"I'm in Ohio and I'm not sure what I want to be. By the time I'm 21, she'll already be 9. I may just be a stay at home mom for a while and then work with animals."
"Aw crap... Black Mirror's starting to come true...

Best advice? Lawyer up, save ALL messages from this person. Don't give into the demands."
"At the beginning, she hardly talked to me. That was my fault, since I hid in my room and hated myself. I blamed myself. But it's not my fault, it's his."
You're right. I misused the word. 
"I’m not impressed by my story at all. You think I’m proud of this? Like I said, you have no perspective on my life so continue getting angry all you want. "
"No questions....I just want to say you have my deepest respect for your courage and your big heart.  I think you are actually facing all this in an incredibly mature way.

"As far as actually contracting the virus we don't entirely know. She was heavy into drugs and prostitution and could have gotten the virus either way.

When she was pregnant with me she refused to take her medication. That's how I was infected.

My parents divorced when I was four and she was not in my life at all. She died of a heart attack in her bed when she was 40. I was in high school. That's really the most I know of her."
If I get another job ASAP I'll be okay. My girlfriend works but her money alone cant support us.
He’s already shitting himself at work as per his TIFU. Doing all right is clearly different for each of us.
"Me: There was ww2 when you were young granny?

Her: I don't remember I know ww2 I don't remember nothing like that.

Me: (Googles) Apparently it was from 39 to 45. You remember anything from then?

Her: Nah I was too young. I was born in 34 so I was really young.

Me: Can't remember anything granny? From like when you were eight or nine?

Her: It was awful. I was babysitting when I was eight and nine I had to go my sister my oldest sister I had to babysit with them go up to my oldest sister house and she had three boys. And I was so scared at that house by myself couldn't been older than seven. And I had to go up to the next sister house and do it. And we were very very very poor. There were many days we didn't have anything to eat. And I had to walk very very far to school (she says roughly from where she lives to where I live so 15 miles or so). And sometimes it's be so cold. Sometimes I came home crying cause I ain't have no coat and my hand and toes were freezing. We had to go to this one little shack to go to school out in the country but not the white kids. It had a heater and we had to sit around it try to stay warm. And we had to sleep on the floor sometime on a pallet and about two or three slept in one bed so baby you've had a good life when you were young. Mom did the best she could and I did everything I could to make sure y'all had a good life

Edit: Added that distance"
"The hardest thing is my sleep schedule. She won't sleep unless I'm with her which sucks.

Thank you for your support! I hope you and your five year old do well."
Now let's ask for somebody who's collected all of Kidz Bop 
"Greetings from r/Thailand. YOU are the kind of asshole that deserves to be in jail and never allowed back. Those that don't live in Thailand have no idea of the drug users, alcoholics, and general shit causing assholes like you that give farang a bad name. IMHO you should be banned for life and you deserve every day you spent in jail. You are just a dumbfuck from the start by bringing drugs into Thailand, to the end where you are so fucking high you steal shit and have no idea. No sympathy here. Guys like you make it hard for people that want to live in Thailand and not get the ""another asshole farang"" rap. 

And yeah, no one wants to buy your movie or whatever shit you are trying to pedal. "
"What's you're favortive part of being a mom so far? What's the hardest? 

As someone who was a teen Mom (had my daughter at 18), I can already tell you that you are an incredibly strong person. You have not only carried and birthed a human being, but after what you've been through and how far you've come, you are such a strong woman. You will get stares, funny looks, rude comments, etc. Just let them roll. You are the only one who knows yourself. You know you're the best mom you can be. I'm a full 10 years older than you and I STILL get looks and rude comments when people see my 5 year old. Just spend your time always focusing on how to make yours and your daughter's life better. Nothing else matters past that. I wish you the best of luck!! "
Kudos to dad.
Does she hold any resentment/negative attitudes towards white people of this generation regarding their ancestors actions? 
NOW That's What I Call Dedication! 
I'm glad to see that it turned out better than it might have seemed
"Everything pretty much carries over for the most part. I do find that some of the tables are lower than I am used to (I am 6 feet tall). Luckily they have Western Style toilets, which is a definite plus for someone who grew up in the US. Overall, its not as uncomfortable as you might expect."
How did people react to your pregnancy?
What's your favourite type of cheese?
"Me: Hey granny. Were you ever involved in the civil rights movement?

Her: No baby I sure wasn't. That was the one thing I never got into. Should have but I didn't 

Me: What'd you think of it?

Her: I was really too young to get into any stuff like that 

Me: But you heard of it then?

Her: Yeah we knew about it but I was never in a position to get involved "
YOU WONT BELIEVE WHERE HE PUT NUMBER 3!
I stepped on a lego once
Did you find somewhere to settle or are you travelling about?
"I see your point, but addiction simply doesn't work that way.

As Robin Williams put it; ""as an addict you will violate your standards faster than you can lower them.""

You don't think logically or even halfway reasonably when you're addicted to a substance. In my case it was alcohol. You wouldn't guess looking at me now or talking to me, but there was a time when I would have assaulted my own grandma for a drink and not think much of it (no, I never actually got violent, thankfully). But it changes your whole perception of reality. Consequences just become a ""meh, OK"", no matter how severe. Empathy and shame abandon you early. You don't see people trying to help you as people trying to help you, you see them as complications getting in the way of you handling your own shit.

You turn into an utter asshole.

The thing is, that's not you. Until you get clean, YOU is somewhere in the background. You're just along for the ride. It sounds insane, but you'd be surprised how well a drug can operate a human body and make decisions for it. Yes, it makes you do horrible things, but trust me, until you've been an addict, it's impossible to describe the sensation of being a spectator in your own body. That's what makes the recovery so much harder. Now you have to deal with the shame and guilt for all the horrible shit you did as an addict, and the whole time you know that guilt will just melt away if you use the drug again."
It's a bit too personal to say.
"I actually have a second condition called idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura that will make having kids more complicated. Basically it's hemophilia (low platelets: I bruise and bleed very easily) that the HIV exacerbated.

As far as only the HIV is concerned, I can have healthy children so long as I continue to take my medication throughout my pregnancy. This was the mistake my mother made, she was non-compliant with her medication during her pregnancy with me and that's why I contracted it. I also will not be able to breastfeed.

If my husband and I ever decide we are ready for children he can also go on a preventative medication when we are trying to even further reduce his risks of contracting.

In short, yes, I can have healthy children as long as I take the right preventative steps"
"Good on you for attempting to understand different perspectives. Hopefully you can turn this experience into something worthwhile and not some ""shits and giggles"" type of experience. 

How many hours do you work? 

Are you staying in a worker dorm? 

Do you get the same benefits as the other workers, or any special treatment? 

How did you get this job, and did the company look at you funny when you asked to do assembly line work?  "
This is so wholesome

I’m 32 and my mom still does that. Maybe it’s just a mom thing. 
"So far, I haven’t really come across something that vexing. I’d say the only thing that kinda bothers me is the occasional smell of stinky tofu in the streets. That’s about it."
What is your life like back home that you felt the need to do this to get perspective?
"I haven’t really thought about that. I can image that the idea that this isn’t my whole life plays a big factor in my positivity around what I’m doing. This is very hard work, so I really have a lot of respect for all my co-workers who have been doing it a long time. "
Thank you so much! 
"My favorite food is spaghetti. From the way she gets it all over her face and hands, I could say the same for her!"
"Yeah, fuck you. I go to school. I'm educated for a *fourteen year old.* I was busy with school things because it was during testing and I didn't realize I was missing my periods. Can you fuck off now? Thanks.

Look at that! Already better work conditions than at Amazon!
"Hey! I don't have any questions but just came here to say this. I've been living in the UK for 5 years and now I'm in the Netherlands. I can wholeheartedly say that I don't think I'll ever go back to the US to live. 

That being said, stay open to the idea of not burning any bridges! I felt for a long time that the UK was better than the US in every conceivable way, until I started seeing people's true colo(u)rs post-Brexit. The sense of superiority is far more subtle than the overt Anglo-American ethnocentrism, but far more classist and cutting. You might discover some things about German society after 10-15 years of living there that go from a chaffing to unacceptable. A family member may go ill, or maybe you'll get a business offer so attractive, it's hard to refuse. 

At the moment, I feel like I'll probably never go back, but at the same time having that passport is like having won the lottery in a global sense. Just think long and hard before you trash it."
"Thank you, but I do have to admit it's been a long, hard road to get to the mindset about it I am in now.

When my husband and I first started dating we were 16. We had met through a mutual friend and had been getting to know each other for a few months. We were very physically attracted to each other but I couldn't in good conscience let things progress til he was fully informed. We were also both virgins. When I told him I admit, his face lost all color and he was understandably freaked the fuck out. But he knew me, and when I explained everything about how I contracted it and how I was handling it, he held my hand, looked me in the eyes, and told me he loved me and didn't see me any differently because ultimately, the HIV was not me. It was an amazingly mature moment for a 16-year-old boy and I knew in that moment I'd marry him someday. "
They certainly would have a unique perspective on trends/themes in popular music over the past 20 years 
Actually I think my mom’s partner might have all of them. She’s a DJ in her spare time and has probably a thousand CDs. 
Don't drop out. Focus on your studies and think about your future and hers. You would want her to look up to you.
I don't have a question but I wanted to wish you the best of luck with you and your daughter. You're really strong and ignore the haters especially people who judge you because of the situation you are in. Cheers!
"She was raped at 12 or 13, had a child, and is here doing an AMA with a positive attitude. What’s with so many assholes in this thread? Maybe don’t be a dick? "
"Honestly, all the food is good. I've come to realize that dishes like ""Lemon Chicken"" or ""Broccoli and Beef"" are way more American than Chinese. I have been eating a lot of Bok Choy, Rice, and Tofu. Love it."
"&gt;“I steal all the time!”

I have lived in Thailand a long time, this part is BS. Stealing is highly frowned upon in Thailand and a middle/upper class Thai woman wouldn't be stealing anything for any reason. It does happen, but not like that."
Settled now for the last 4 years. 
I'm really fucking done. Somebody asked me if it felt good. What is wrong with people?
"I've reported them to the mods. Hopefully, they'll take action soon.

Edit: Thanks for the gold. I don't know what to say, except that it's reassuring to know, that most people on the internet/Reddit are good people.  I'll try to pass it on, if I can. "
Should I try this?
"Her: Yeah. Treat everybody right just like you'd want to be treated and if someone want to talk sometimes just listen. And do unto others as you want done unto you. Don't help someone for some praise or nothing I done helped a lot of people and sometimes they don't appreciate it or disappoint you but I always try to help someone. I want the work that I do to speak for me when I'm dead and gone. Some people get to talking and get crazy, and they do it but they know its not true but I want it to be true.

Edit: Clean up"
"Any which way. I've met ladies in supermarkets, at dog parks, concerts- you name it. "
"Her: if everybody just love one another. There's just so much hate in the world. That's what's important and there's so much killing and anger and as a black race we need to stop killing and love one another. Stop the killing stop the hatred.

Me: What about music? Who's your favorite mucisian?

Her: I don't really have any. You mean now? Back then..smoky Robinson. There were so many of them. Michael Jackson I can't name them all there's so many"
I like the soft ones. My butthole is sensitive. 
"So, how do you go about telling potential partners that you are HIV positive (obviously not by your own doing)"

"I was addicted to Valium which has been out of my system for 2 years. 

I’m not addicted to Valium anymore but I am a drug addict that’s part of my personality. I can use drugs to have fun though, never had a problem with anything apart from Valium. I have to be careful or course. I’m doing just fine now and I’ll put whatever substances I want into my body. I can tell you for certain I won’t be putting any Valium in my system ever again. "
"You're very welcome! I am honestly very surprised that people want to know about it! lol

My older sister actually began working at the residence where I'm at when I was 15 years old. She would bring one of the clients over to my parent house for lunch sometimes (where I was living). I met her DeafBlind client and was immediately touched. After seeing her interact with him , I knew then and there it's what I wanted to do. I had to wait until I was 18 to begin employment  there. It was part of the Canadian Deafblind Association.

Unfortunately, the pay is awful. It's little over minimum wage and has barely changed. I got ALOT of pressure from everyone around me telling me find another line of work as I would have a hard time surviving on this salary. It's true, but I still love my job and my clients nonetheless. That's the only downside for me. 

A particularly memorable experience I had was when one client became ill and was hospitalized. I can only imagine how frightening it was for them. When I arrived for my shift at the hospital with them and they realized who it was, they began to cry and hold onto me extremely tight. That was a moment I won't forget, I could feel the love. (Often times there is violent behavior to deal with if the client is feeling anxious or frustrated, hospitals have security guards and restraints for that, not Intervenors, so you can imagine what happens to the client when they aren't properly trained with a Deafblind individual)"
Has any element of being black in America stayed the same all the way from when you were a kid until now?
"Very, very much so. Both parties have a lot of faults in this situation and both parties used us for campaign stops during the election. 

Bernie and Hillary held their debate here and after that Hillary was out. Bernie will still mention Flint at times. Trump came to our water department and simply walked in for a photo op and was out. Obama came, took a sip of water and stated it was fine. During this time our water was at its peak for bacteria, metals and lead. "
Both. I really learned most from my mom. She taught me everything I know.
"Me: Hey granny. What's your favorite type of cheese?

Her: uhhh cheddar cheese

Me: Why cheddar? No love for provolone?

Her: Tell you the truth I like just about all cheese I really do. 

Me: You just like cheddar more?

Her: I like cheddar I like all kinds of cheese. Swiss cheese. I got more cheese I like I really do"
"Hi friend, if you seriously are hungry and don’t have a way to get food please PM me. I’m going to bed in like 5 mins but if you get back to me I will send you something when I get up. ❤️"

"Wrong place/wrong time, mostly. Last time was about 3 weeks ago. I got upset when I saw a car horizontally park while taking up 3 handicapped parking spaces. They didn’t need even 1 of those spots. I let them know how I felt. Their reaction was a to pull a gun. "
"Holy shit dude... been waiting on this update for 2 years lol! 

I remember reading your play by play shitposting, and would check to see if there was ever any update every once in a while. Totally gave up on that though. Crazy to see this. 

While thai jail sounds miserable, it still sounds much better than a US jail at least in many regards. Namely it seems much safer with regard to physical harm from other prisoners. Would you agree with that assessment?

What was your least favorite experience during your stint? 

I see you will still drink beer, but have you otherwise remained sober since getting home? 


But yeah man, thanks for sharing. I've been to Thailand once and plan to go back, and your story is definitely a good warning. Just for any one else reading this I just want to say that Thailand is a fantastic and safe country, and as long as you don't act like an idiot like op did (No offense) you'll be totally fine. 

Glad you made it out ok dude. Great ama so far too. Should be more popular. You can probably reap some nice karma if you post this on that certain sub too lol. For a long time people would bring you up and like you said, there was a serious movement to help you there. Especially one dude went above and beyond. Edit: oh nvm looks like that sub got deleted for some reason. Oh well. "

"My ex husband was diagnosed after we split up but he’d keep  in touch with my mom. 
He called her one time and told her his dr had some really good medication but a side effect is cancer, and one that didn’t work nearly as well. He didn’t know what to do.  He ended up taking the drug and got cancer.  He’s cancer free now but Jesus....have you had any of your intestines removed yet?"
Sorry to hear that.  Do you have enough in your savings to get you by?
Thank you very much!
"The day I got out? I was actually staying in the hospital the day I was released, this was the best place to be as the sleeping arrangements were much better. I was there from my birthday (31st May) until my release (16th June). I think they allowed me to stay in the hospital so they could get me as healthy as possible for my release. When release day came they didn’t allow me to go and say goodbye to everyone or empty out my locker, so I lost a lot of peoples contact details and things I had written/drawn. I’m a bit bummed about that. 

I was picked up by a plain clothed policeman in a pickup truck. He was supposed to take me straight to the airport. Instead he pulled over on the highway, got out with all my paperwork and my passport in his hand and asked me how much money I had on me. I was like “dude, obviously I have zero monies on me”. So he said “okay you go to IDC (immigration detention centre)”. 

I had been warned repeatedly by the embassy that the IDC was worse than prison, and if I end up there they will get me out ASAP. I didn’t believe them, how could anywhere be worse than this? I was wrong, that place sucked. It was like purgatory for criminals. A multi story car park essentially filled with people. Nothing but huge industrial fans to ventilation and you got to outside once every few days for an hour if you were lucky. The food was horrible, I tasted like piss. I have no idea how you manage to fuck food up so bad. The rice was even just a solid lump of shit. ‘Hard rice for hard motherfuckers’ was what I was told by the Canadian dude I was sleeping next to. 

I was there for 4 days because it was over a weekend. This is where they process you for deportation. I had photos taken and my fingertips taken. My passport got stamped with a big red stamp and I was handed a legal notice stating I am now an illegal alien and am banned for 5 years. 

The embassy helped book my place ticket which has to be paid for by yourself. In my case my family helped with that. As soon as the flight was booked I was released. But they want 300baht for your ride to the airport, in cash. So the embassy had to make a deal with the lady in charge so they could arrange some cash. The corruption was astounding there. Guards were allowing prisoners to go to an ATM and buy KFC - for a price. And if you wanted to hug your child that was visiting that would cost you 2000baht. That was pretty sickening I thought. 

That place was terrible and I met one Chinese guy that had been stuck there for 11 years. 11 years! He has no one to help him get a passport or a flight home. He stuck there and he’s not even a criminal anymore. None of us were. I can’t imagine his life. 

The day I got back to the UK I was still wearing my prison clothes. Deportees aren’t allowed alcohol on the flight, and the captain looks after your passport to be given to the English border force when you land. You are the last one on the plane and the last one off. I was pretty annoyed about the lack of alcohol... I was really looking forward to a beer. I didn’t really sleep on the plane home, I watched a couple of movies (John wick 2 and horrible bosses 2) and tried to sleep but my mind was racing too much. 

When I got to Heathrow, to my surprise all my family was there. My dad had got older and skinnier (he diabetic) and my mum had stopped dying her hair so she was grey and looked a lot different. It was only a year and I honestly barely recognised my own parents. We went and got coffee with my brothers so I think the first thing I ate was one of those really expensive slices of cake you get a coffee shops. 

I was craving real Coca Cola for some reason the most. We only had cheap knockoff stuff in prison. And I really really wanted a McDonald’s double cheeseburger. I wasn’t fussy though and I don’t remember anything in particular. For a while though every time I ate/drank something I would be like “damn this is my first beer/burger/curry/KFC etc in a year”. 

Readjusting took time. Almost a year in fact but here I am, waiting for my bus to work writing about it. "
"This is a textbook example of how not to talk to people with drug addiction. Drug addiction is not the guy's fault. It is not. If you think it is, research the subject, instead of voicing your biased reasoning. Yes, i feel bad for family, friends, but more so for the guy himself. "

What's her secret to living a happy/healthy life? 
"It fucks you up man. Seriously. And not just physically but mentally also. It’s a struggle. Some days are good, some not. You can’t control chrons. But atleast you can’t let it control you. Do the things you like and try to live life to the fullest. Sometimes you feel shitty and you think to yourself “what’s even the point” you know. But you have to be strong and that’s that. I shit my pants in public couple of times. And you just feel so low. Curently i feel ok. My treatment is working (kinda still not great great but i probably never will be 100%) and yeah...just have to keep on going. And btw i love how you said “what does it do to you” like it’s a alien or some like fucked up thing. "
Where do you find the stigma the hardest?
"If anyone is ever in a vaguely similar state and just wants somewhere quiet to sleep while they wait for a plane at suvarnabhumi.  Go to the very bottom floor, they have these escalators that go down, then flat then down again.  There is a space under the escalators where you'll often see Thai people sleeping while also waiting for flights.  

There's also a super cheap food court on the bottom floor where the airport staff eat, you can easily get a simple meal for less than 100 THB.  Even better don't turn up to the airport off your face on substances legal or illegal, but if you do, those are your best bets to stay out of trouble."
"you are so full of shit. Thailand has a completely different set of values than the UK does. you’d think a single piece of that reality would resonate after effectively living in Thai prison for a year, what the actual fuck"
"I speak less chinese than they do English. But not by much, so talk is limited the few who really know English very well."
"No, actually. You got me there. "
Not really. I think it's just more of a coincidence that women who are struggling financially are more inclined to accept my offer. 
"I'm really surprised your AMA hasn't gotten anymore attention man, your story is honestly super interesting and surprises me, even for reddit.

Anyways, my first question is: How have the people in your life treated you after being released? 

Second question: IRL, are you open about your experience? And if so, how do people usually react when you tell them?

Amazing AMA, I'm happy to hear you're doing better, and don't get arrested next time you go to Thailand, stick to hanging out with monkeys."
"This guy is an asshole. Dont let him get to you. People who have never been addicted to anything dont understand. I was addicted to a few things a while back. And as long as I dont take those I'm fine. I can still smoke weed and various other things. Just not those couple things. I understand brother. And I'm sorry about your rough stay, valium is fucked up shit"
Rooting for you and Addison! XOXO

"you’re just a classic drug addict who hyperbolizes to hopefully imbue an otherwise lame story with some life, but I personally don’t think that’s impressive. I do, however, find it offensive that you would lie about something that very much has to do with the values of others."
Mostly drink Chinese beer and struggle to buffer YouTube videos.
"It’s hard to remember the price details etc. Money was banned in prison so you only officially have money in your prison account. The currency used for the black market was sachets of instant coffee. So prices were pretty random and hard I come by. 

I got about £100 every 4-6 weeks from the charity which would only last me half of that time. Coffee sachets were 5 baht each so I’d usually convert some of my money straight into coffee, it’s a strange economy now I think about it. Cigarettes were between 30-60baht a packet and tobacco was crazy cheap, about 18 baht if I remember correctly. Cigarette lighters were contraband and cost at least 100 baht as they were smuggled in somehow, even though we manufactured them in house. 

Noodles varied again, depending on what brand they were but somewhere between 5-10 baht a packet. No booze in prison unfortunately, but for very good reason. 

Blowjobs wouldn’t cost you a penny, but would be a sure fire way to get herpes at least I would imagine. I had lots of offers but politely declined them all.  "

"I am living in a workers dorm, and a pretty nice one at that! I get my own room and bathroom, and start work at around 8am every week day. All the meals are made by cooking crew and are covered by the company. Besides that, we get three square meals a day and breaks about four times a day. I will usually leave work around 6-7 at night and wind up falling asleep around 10pm. Its hard work, but its quite rewarding."
Favourite childhood joke?
Are you allowed to have sexual contact? 
"I just want to tell you how freaking awesome you are. You’re so strong. I’m 17, so not much older than you, but I could never take on a responsibility like that. You’re far more mature than a lot of adults I know. I hope life treats you well, sweetheart. Stay awesome. "
"(I never met the grandfather on her side)

Me: So what was life like before you had dad then?
