"DUDE! This also happened to my boyfriend and his mom! 

His mom calls him up and says the Red Hot Chili Peppers are playing at the park in {insert small podunk town in a midwestern state that’s about 30 minutes from us.} He’s skeptical and asks her to double check that it’s correct, she excitedly responds back that it’s right there in the paper! 

So they make plans to get lunch and see the show. I’m working that day and see I have 5 missed calls from my boyfriend. When I finally get to call him back, I thought something was seriously wrong because he was laughing so hard he was crying. 

Yup. Red Hot Chili Pipers strike again...."
"You made a difficult decision. You may have saved his life if a fire starter or the cables came down on him. Keep in mind as well, that the collision could be the cause of him being paralyzed not you.

For background, I am a soapmaker. Soap is basically just fats and lye (aka caustic soda) mixed together. When I was first starting out, I had a crappy plastic jar that I used to hold my lye water mixture. One day, I noticed that a ton of condensation had pooled up under the jar. Deciding that it was just a little odd that my lye water had started condensating (but not having the common sense to know that that's not how any of this works), I decided to taste test the little puddle that had formed, just to be sure that it wasn't lye. 

It was lye.

"&gt;the doctor told me that someone (myself or animal welfare) has to watch the cat for 10 days to determine if it (or I) has rabies

What the fuck? If you start showing symptoms of rabies, *it's too late and you will almost certainly die*. If there's any chance you've been infected, you need the vaccine **ASAP**. 10 days is too long to wait! The vaccine is 100&amp;#37; effective when given immediately after infection, and slowly loses effectiveness until neurological symptoms develop, at which point only one human in recorded history has survived (as far as i'm aware).

"Ive worked with feral cats and kittens for a long time. 

I recommend quarantine to a small inescapable area like a bathroom with box and food and water. I would put a bed in for comfort and toys. Feral cats arent huge into to toys so YMMV. 

Then when you take the kitten out, scruff it, wrap it in a towel and spend time on the couch with it. Hang out as much as you can with it. 

Cats typically scratch first and bite is second option, so when taking the cat out it may hiss and even if you have to wear a glove, you should grab it despite the hissing or swatting. Never back down from that when trying to tame a kitten bc they as a normal person would, assume that reaction gets them out of an uncomfortable/scary solution. 

Giving it cover though in a box is IMHO a bad idea past a day or two. Gotta keep moving on if you want to tame it. If not just spay/neuter and release if it's too far gone. They aren't adoptable at that point. I prefer the open air as a way to get used to surroundings and even basic interactions which is why a bathroom is good. You go in to pee, kitten sees he's not harassed, you go on your way. All is well. 

Other times, take kitten out and hold in a towel. You will ultimately get purrs. It may always be a skittish cat based on age and circumstances, but they are undyingly loyal to the ones that they rely on. 

Good luck. Also get him/her fixed asap at that age. Female cats go into heat until they get pregnant and my god is it annoying. Males start to spray. 

If you need anything else, Im here. PM me"

"If it makes you feel any better, I have done this, sober, twice. Full faceplant. Fortunately I stayed conscious the second time and dragged my ass to the hospital a couple miles away and the first time I got picked up by an ER nurse on her way to her shift who saw it go down as I was blacking out 😂. Good luck with your recovery! I found the dental issues were the biggest ones. If you feel like you can advocate for it, have the dental team look for other teeth having hairline fractures that lead to future infections... Ive lost a few teeth from that and it took about a year for it to become an issue. "

"It's not that bad...  Being paraplegic I mean.    I'm going on 8 years now happened when i was 20 from a motorcycle accident. 


I never blame anyone else because if it wasn't for the motorcycle accident would have happened somewhere else in a more uncool way

It didn't hit me until I got outta the rehabilitation center.. everything was different. Lost my job, friends wouldn't come see me bc ""it was hard for them"" I couldn't even fit my wheelchair into my bathroom I would have to crawl if I wanted to shower, we didn't have a ramp, and I was angry at myself that it caused my previous GF to leave, fights with my other loved ones and with multiple failed suicide attempts in the early years. 

But things got better...
I found a group of guys going through what I have already. We play sled hockey together in the winter and we can talk and understand each other. Having this really helps. 

Fast forward 8 years...
I just bought a house with my fiance, I work a fill time job, and I'm constantly outta my wheelchair on the floor tuning my cars. I wouldn't change it for the world. I'm happier now than I ever was pre accident.

Think of the positives, it's a young kid who can fight through and recover. He has a tough road in front of him the next CPL years are gonna be exhausting but he will progress and hopefully recover.

"My science teacher had a solution to this. Kahoot has a feature that if you enable, will require you to put in a pattern in the exact order it shows on the teachers screen. The pattern also changes every 7 seconds, so you can’t say, “it’s red, blue, green, yellow”, or whatever order it’s in. Kahoot also has a feature you can enable that doesn’t allow players to choose their own screen name. Instead, you have to spin a wheel, and you are forced to use that name against your will.

"Three things inadvertently lead to Nickelback being universally hated:

1. In 1996, a regulation that prevented businesses from owning more than 40 radio stations was removed.  Clear Channel and Infinity ending up buying a vast majority of them.  The goal was to maximize profit, and that meant little risk taking.

2. Around 1998-1999, Napster took off in popularity.  Bands favored by the technologically savvy saw reduced album sales, while bands majorly enjoyed by older and less tech savvy individuals saw a far lesser reduction in sales.  (I worked in music around 2006, and by then album sales were 10% of what they used to be.  The dive in sales from 1999-2006 was fucking brutal.  I have no idea how it is these days.)

3. Grunge 'died' around 1997, to quickly be replaced by Nü Metal.  Not everyone was a fan.  Around three years later the garage music scene exploded.  However, the corporations that owned all the radio stations crunched the numbers, and were seeing better results with radio listeners to continue playing bands that were popular in the 1990s, Nü Metal, and bands that somehow straddled the line...

a.k.a. Nickelback.

The radio played the ever fucking love out of Nickelback from 2001-2008, because they were a 'new' band who didn't see massively declining album sales and wanted to promote them, both because they were new to the mainstream and because albums that are already selling well tend to do better returns on further radio exposure.  

Everyone heard Nickleback from 2001-2008, whether they wanted to or not, and it drove people mad.  Especially songs like 'Photograph,' that literally starts with the line, ""Look at this photograph.""  It was like the radio was trolling you non-stop for years.

^(Not that radio has improved since then, but I feel like most people have given up on radio as there are so many more options today.)"

"So here is what you need to know about this. The egg cases are called ootheca or ""ooth"" for short. The ootheca in the Amazon pic is from the Chinese Mantis. The mantids have not finished hatching from that ooth so expect to see a few more popping out. Even though you're seeing a lot now, many are going to die off and no one has been able to pinpoint why they have mass die offs once they emerge. If you put the ooth outside you'll be putting them at risk for parasitic wasps to attack them. *If* one of these manages to become an adult you're looking at 3-4 inches in size. Females will be larger than the males and you'll be able to tell as males will look slender. Also, color has nothing to do with gender but the number of segments that comprise the abdomen does. However, you won't be able to tell the sex until they've undergone several molts.

"I'm really happy for you. Thanks for sharing this.

I'll tell you what was going through my mind as well.

So, I drive Uber as my regular job, and just the day before this happened (Thursday), I picked up a passenger and I think his step-son and the step-son's friend. I saw the guy was in a wheelchair, and had lost a leg. Everything was pretty normal, and it was a long ride (I think around 40 minutes or more). The guy was pretty jovial, and he liked talking, which I like because it makes the rides less awkward and go by faster.

I'd like to think that he wouldn't mind me sharing this story, and I'll try to keep his identity vague.

So, in Dallas, people drive like complete shit. Like, obscenely irresponsible, arrogant driving. A car forces me to break as it cuts us off and weaves further up, speeding. The passenger gets angry and mentions, ""That's how the fuck this happened,"" as he nods towards his missing leg. He tells me that he lost his leg recently-- at the beginning of the year. He drove one of those on-site office  box trucks, and when he was on a kind of empty stretch of frontage road, a guy coming the opposite direction crossed the median and slammed into him.

He recounts how his truck immediately caught fire, and all he could think about was getting out of there, especially with his legs injured. He says that when he woke up in the hospital, they told him that the other guy died on impact. I ask him how he feels... if he struggles, and he says that, yeah, sometimes he does, but most of all he's just upbeat. I tell him he's headed for a big payday, and he says that there's a big investigation to support his account, and that it might take some time, but he says that he's pretty good at controlling his low moments and stays determined and positive to get better.

When we finally arrive at the location, I get the wheelchair out and the kids help him out. I take a closer look at him: his right leg is in a cast with a swollen foot and his arm has some serious burn scars.

I tell them to take care, and I think I mention something about hoping for him to get better. Can't remember exactly.


So, ANYWAYS, while I was standing back and that guy said ""Hey man, it's leaking gas,"" that story, fresh in my head, popped in. I don't know how big of an impact it had on my reaction to try to get the guy out, but it definitely made me empathize with the kid in a way that would have made me feel cowardly and inferior if I didn't try something.

Thanks brother."
"Sorry, but I have no sympathy for you. Your dad made it clear to leave it alone. Not only didn't you, but you did it deliberately and purposefully right in front of the guy. You confirmed all his attitudes for him because, why? You had no other way to get a cherry?

Everyone else is mad at the old guy, but you spat on him and your dad over literally nothing. I kinda think the old guy is justified. Like he said, it's the principal of the thing. The intentional snide action was the offense, not the cherry.

Wow, my first gilded comment!

You liked what i wrote, and you gave me some gold;  
Its all in the throat, like a rythmic chokehold;  
i could talk of a stoat, who likes to eat mould;  
or a small billy goat, with a nasty head cold;  
i could let you all vote, if i might be so bold;  
or rephrase someones quote, let a story unfold;  
use my gift to promote, or a secret withhold;  
be a user of note, in the annals of old;  
who others misquote, and the front page remould;  
leaving here but a mote, with a trail gone cold;  
of a poem once wrote, by a guy who earned gold.

"Honestly, he shouldn't have lived.






You don't call Pablo Escobar to meet a teenager who gave you five dollars.

"Never. Ever. Have. Anything. To. Do. With. Drugs. In. Foreign. Countries.

Edit: Talking about illegal drugs. I know there are places where weed is legal (legalise it already), and some of you might feel comfortable buying and using recreational drugs even if they're illegal, but is the risk of death sentence/jail time really worth the risk? You're your own master, but there are consequences."
"This is bullshit the Red Hot Chili Pipers worked their asses off making a name for themselves and the Red Hot Chili Peppers just come along and piggy back on their good name. Someone should tell these guys, I think Flea might even be an assumed identity."
"Actually, a testicular torsion can happen anytime anywhere. I was at a LAN party with a friend and at like 4 everyone went to sleep. When I woke up he was gone and his dad came in the room and was like, ""(friend) got his nuts in a twist so we had to run him to the hospital."" I will never let him live it down.

edit: LAN not IAN"
"It would definitely fall under implied consent. OP did exactly what he should have. He knew in an ideal situation he shouldn't move him, but the situation wasn't ideal. The risk of the pole falling, and the potential for fire or explosion made it worth the risk of moving him.

A+ job by OP. "
It's probably how the Red Hot Chili Pipers earn their money

"I brought a cap gun to school when I was much younger. I wanted to show my friend the new cowboy revolver looking one I got so we could play with them after class. His brother peeped in and noticed it. He began shouting ""he's got a gun!"" and the bus stopped. A police officers pulled me out and took the gun. I went to the principals office and they suspended me for one day. The cops took the gun as evidence and the cop looked at me and was like ""sorry to take your cap gun"". I was in first grade at the time. My friends mom beat the shit out of his brother when she found out. "

"Can't say I feel sorry for you. You fucked with a known asshole and he overreacted and acted like a jerk, so you got what was coming. But I guess that's why this is a TIFU."
"You brought up a crucial point, that you didn't want to go broke from the medical system.

This is, IMHO, a public health emergency, because of how disincentized the USA makes everyone to curtail preventable illness.

In the future i recommend little helmets for your teeth

"Another possibility is that my dad's friend took a stab at what it was but didn't know for certain. It was white granules, looked a lot like granulated sugar (maybe the crystals were a little larger than granulated sugar in retrospect), it was in clumps in places like granulated sugar. Oh, and it tasted like death."
Guess they never found who you were in kahoots with.

"I might have to reorganize my bike workshop / balcony then... Currently I store my brake fluid in an old milk bottle made of glass. It's clearly relabelled and I even put some skulls on it though.

"Hey now. Don’t be so hard on yourself. That’s an intense and very scary situation. Anyone standing there in their right mind would have pulled that man out of a vehicle that was burning or going to catch fire. 

He couldn’t be left there in that hazardous situation without being in immediate danger. You didn’t fuck up, whatever lowlife hit him and split- did. If anything, you might have just saved this man from something worse. It’s a very unfortunate situation, regardless this young kid gets another day with his family. It could have gone very differently. "
Thank you so much for this.
Yeah I would be fucking terrified of smoking outside legal countries and the US. 3 years for use in kenya? no thanks.
