"If there are four fully packed subway cars and the fifth magically has no one in it, you did not get lucky and find a car that everyone else was too dumb to see. There is no heat/AC in that car, there is a horrific smell there, or there is a drunk/disturbed/smelly person there. Itâ€™s a trap, donâ€™t fall for it. "
"Mine is weird, but, I avoided mta busses because I was told they're a shit show. I took all these convoluted train routes and even picked walking over the bus sometimes.

The bus is for sure a shit show, but it's a shit show that fills in every gap left by the trains. They go everywhere. Take the busses. "
"Growing up here was amazing. The independence is great, the resources (museums for everything), no one drives but everyone can get around, the sense of being some place so important, the energy, how smart so many are, and just all the ideas you are exposed to. I loved it. "
"Quaint, cozy, charming, intimate, unique, and great location are all synonyms for shoebox"
I love this question. 
"This, 100%. And if everyone in your car gets up and starts moving to one side, do it too, don't bother finding out why, it'll be too late by the time you do"
"Just FYI, the other poster was calling YOU an ignorant racist. 

Calling something ""jungle"" music (whatever the fuck you think that is) is pretty fucking insulting.  Hard to even say how many different people you're insulting with that term.

Fyi the cops are training the k-9 unit in those buildings so there is a significant cop presence at night
"Revolution happened. The coloured are taking over. 

Time to move back to Ohio. "
nice try cop
Report him before he kills someone. At least ring the cab firm I'd say and tell them what happened. Glad you are ok.
"i've walked through conservative areas in Brooklyn and Queens holding my boyfriend's hand and not even gotten a second look. but i've also gotten glares and epithets thrown at me for doing the same in midtown Manhattan. generally it's a very gay-friendly city but nowhere is immune to homophobes. i try to stay extra aware of my surroundings if i'm wearing/doing something gay, even in gay-friendly areas of the city."
Missed out on an amazing rent stabilized apartment some years ago because I needed a day to 'think about it'.
"Find a BYOB place, and bring nothing ðŸ˜€"
It's not the local food stuffs from the environment that makes NY food so amazing. It's the *people* who come to NY with their own food stuff that does. 
"I hate to break it to you, but this is a bit that this guy does likely on the daily. I've personally seen him do it twice, once between cars on the subway and once ""attempting"" to jump in front of an incoming train. Same guy. My roommates have also seen the same guy do the in between car bit on different days. He tells people he is going to kill himself and then people rush to him to help and he tells them he has no money for food or shelter and has nothing to live for and then they pile the money on him. I kid you not when I saw him doing the attempted jump bit a guy ran over and gave him a $100 bill and then after that guy left on the train he tried doing the bit again with a different crowd. I watched the whole thing happen with my friend while we were waiting for another friend to meet us and she called the police and when they came down to talk to the guy he flipped a shit and ran out of the subway."
"I mean, there are some orthodox Jewish areas in Brooklyn where you might get a disapproving look (because they disapprove of everything...).  But otherwise you could be wearing matching leather jock straps and French-kissing and most people wouldn't even look up from their phones. "
"I hate them with extreme passion. They're selfish, irritating, never fun, and expensive.

Us sitting at a Last Supper-esque table. The birthday broad in the middle. You're sitting across from:

&gt; A. The most shy person in the group.
&gt; 
&gt; B. The couple that has no interest in talking.
&gt; 
&gt; C. The guy that talks only about himself. 

Your friends are sitting on the other side of the table because they showed up late.

It take 80 hours to order, *""So we get a thing to share? Should we do a bottle? I don't drink. UM I'M A VEGAN.""*

The stifled conversation,

 *""So...what do you do...""*

 *""Are you from New York??""*

*""omg Donald TRUMP SUX!!!!""*




We eat our mediocre Italian/Mexican food.

&gt; * Someone orders the 50 dollar steak. 
&gt; * Someone orders a side of olives for 5.00
&gt; * Someone orders another bottle of wine without asking the table.
&gt; * 
The interesting conversation is way down on the other side.

You swish your overpriced drink and envy the three person table sitting across the restaurant. 
Swig more wine, you're going to get your moneys worth of this bottle.
By the time they pass it to you, there are drops left.


Dinner is finally finished and someone suggest dessert. Daggers shoot out of your eyes, but the birthday broad is excited.

More wine is ordered. Overpriced artisan ice cream and brownies distributed.

Now it's time. The check. 

The waiter is already miffed with you guys and places the scroll length check on the table.

**""I can only take two cards.""** he says it with glee in his eyes.

The check is $10,000 and suddenly everyone becomes a teetotaler. 

*""Lets split it up equally. I only had a salad. I didn't order any cocktails. I'M VEGAN. I didn't have any of the fourth bottle. There was a fourth bottle? I don't have venmo. All I have is 15 bucks""* 



After 34 minutes of arguing

You dish out 80 dollars for two glasses of wine and a $10 dollar generic Italian/Mexican dish. You don't even like Italian/Mexican.

The couple across from you finally peeps up, *""WE CAN'T LET THE BIRTHDAY GIRL PAY FOR HERSELF.""* 

The crowd gasp, *""NO OF COURSE NOT.""*

You pay 120 dollars for two glasses of wine and a 10 dollar meal. 


You've wasted three hours of your life and you're hungry and still sober.

Whoosh
"The only time i've reported a cab driver (And to the police) was when a guy picked me up i asked him before i got in if his credit card machine worked.  He said yes.  I got in and told him where i was going (33rd and 7th ave penn station).  We get there - he locks the door and says i have to pay him cash and it's 17 bucks (when the meter a second before read 8 bucks - and he turned it off)

I said i'm paying credit, let me see it on the screen.  He shouts it's not working and i must pay him cash.  I start banging on the door as he's pulled over in front of Penn station and a cop comes over.  At this point he unlocks the door as i'm waving the cop over and i jump out.  He says you need to pay you need to pay!  and the cop stops him - i told the police what was happening and he was being detained.  I stayed around to give my statement to the police and he was given a citation ONLY, and was sent off on his way.  I thought he would have been arrested but it's a he said she said sorta thing.  

So i got his cab number, license and everything and called the company and complained about him b/c he's trying to rip off customers and detain them which is illegal.  "
I wish I had known to sell my car right away.
I love the legitimate advice in this thread.
"I wouldn't sit on a random stoop, but I don't think it's a big deal. That said, I don't like it when people chilling on my stoop don't move when I'm approaching to enter or exit my building. Move out the way when people come. "
"Youâ€™re the one whoâ€™s being the most racist here, buddy. "

"Asking about the safety of New York City and its many neighborhoods is a [common question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/wiki/commonquestions).

ice109: ""i swear every week there are 2 or 3 posts with people afraid to walk the street... maybe we should start saying no it's not safe and you should just stay inside all day.""

Convergecult15: ""You don't have to get too far from the Hudson to run into people that think NYC is a warzone.""

tipppph: ""Safe is such a relative and loaded concept. What feels safe to me as a black woman may feel very different for a white woman.""

In general, New York City is one of the [safest big cities in the world](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-20-safest-cities-in-the-world-2015-1). Crime is at [historic lows](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/home/poa_crime.shtml). It is generally agreed by contributors to this subreddit that [the city is safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/2re4be/serious_question_how_safe_is_nyc_right_now/), especially the areas frequented by tourists, like the borough of [Manhattan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/4f8j6f/is_it_safe_to_walk_around_manhattan_at_night/), as well as [the subway](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/3t3rse/is_it_safe_riding_the_subway_at_night/).

Like any major city, there are disadvantaged neighborhoods that tourists and new arrivals should avoid, based on crime statistics and reputation. Brownsville, Hunts Point, Mott Haven, East New York, parts of Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant (specifically in the immediate vicinity of large low-income housing projects) are typically considered to be more dangerous than other areas. Even so, thousands of people live, work, and play in these neighborhoods without feeling unsafe.

"This is NYC. You probably won't even get any weird looks.

I say wear it proud and you will be just fine.  You are obviously a very considerate person just by asking the question, so just trust your judgement.

Leave a little extra time so you can skip a train if needed.

Have a great time!!"
"A few possibilities:

1. The conductor opens the doors again completely, you step into the train.  
2. The conductor opens the doors partially and closes them again. He or she does this repeatedly, bashing your arm with the doors until you remove it.  
3. A passenger on the inside will grab the door and pull it open for you to hop on.  
4. The doors close on your arm, [trapping you there as the train accelerates out of the platform](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/straphanger-jonathan-lynn-sues-mta-incident-arm-trapped-subway-doors-article-1.147099). 

Immediately after all of these, the conductor will announce that you shouldn't hold the car doors."

Times Square Bigbird shaking down a tourist
The part where I get on the downtown 6.
Are there also a lot of crooks and nannies
Yes. Very safe.
"That you should never take the automatic variable rate electricity plan from ConEd. ""Variable rate"" = ""we can change the cost of your electricity at any moment for no reason"". A fixed rate plan might look more expensive at first, but it means your electricity costs won't spontaneously triple.

"It's a Saturday - you'll be fine. If you're worried about it, try to leave a little early so you can skip a train if it's packed and try to look for where the cars are less crowded (often the front or back of the train, but not always)."
