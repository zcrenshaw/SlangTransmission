"Food. Ordering in, going out, even just going to the grocery store to buy treats. My guilty pleasure is — and always will be — food. "
"Absolutely the way they finger me. When they put two fingers in and just jackhammer in and out as fast as they can, I know they learned how to do it from porn. I had to talk to a couple of guys about it and they all pointed to porn as the culprit and said no girl ever complained before, lol. "
He looks at a comic or a meme or video or gif or whatever on his phone and then laughs and locks his phone and sets it down then DESCRIBES IT to whoever he’s with. JUST SHOW THEM THE THING. SHOW THEM. *THE THING.*
"When I want to get to know someone, I always ask them: ""So, what keeps you happily busy?"" And, ""Is there anything that you're excited about/looking forward to/working towards?"" 

This opens the door to so many answers other than: ""I work at X"" 
I don't believe a person's job can always define who they are. In fact, seems like most people just work to make money in order to support what they actually enjoy doing. That's what I'm interested in. Who they are when no one's paying them. 

In this way, people will tell me about their hobbies, the goals that they are working towards, the relationships that they are in, what their kids are like, their worries, thoughts and dreams etc. It's personable, allows them to express themselves and it makes me happy to get to know the real them.

"He basically came into this world a 50 year old middle manager. All his favorite jokes, references, shows, and movies are from at least ten years before he was born. He thinks jokes about Cold War politics are hilarious and topical.

I love him anyway."

"I was set up on a blind date with a guy. I immediately felt he wasn't my type but I was willing to give him a chance. Very soon into the date he mentioned wanting children and I told him I wasn't really keen on having kids. Instead of moving on or asking why, he proceeded by trying to convince me that my body shape was perfect for having children and wouldn't let it go. I felt like he was appraising livestock so I told him the kids thing was a no-go for me and ended the date.  "
"When I was in 6th grade, I went to the doctor and when I was in the waiting room I was drawing a picture. This old lady sitting next to me told me that she liked it and asked if I was interested in art and I told her that I wasn’t really interested in it until I met my current art teacher. I told her my teacher’s name and she looked really proud and told me that it was actually her daughter. She knew knew the school that she taught at and told me that she was new there, which was true. So the next day I told my teacher that I met her mom and she looks at me dumbfounded and tells me that her mom died a few years back. To this day I can’t explain what happened or why a ghost would have singled me out at a doctors office."
That catcalling is not complimentary and is in fact demoralizing and often scary.
"He said ""you'd vote for a woman President, wouldn't you,"" in the most condescending tone I've ever heard. He proceeded to follow me to the hostess stand where I requested my bill, tried to stop me from paying and then followed me to the parking lot and explained how his grandmother had never learned to write checks and that it was better that way. My roommate picked me up after the most annoying 10 minutes of my life."
"They don’t deserve a pat on the back for helping with household chores. You live here too, pick up the vacuum"
"Throwing me around the bed doing every position possible for two minutes at a time.  

Choking is a lot more mainstream.

"
"I've told this story before on reddit, but I went on a date with a guy who actually wanted to date someone else and just couldn't tell us apart. "
"Wearing ill-fitting clothes. I've dated many different men that would buy sizes based on how they felt about them -- even though they looked better in a size small, they'd buy mediums because they didn't like being smalls."
He is long winded as fuck.
"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon. Sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It's good for me. It's a perfect way to start the day."
"I deal with it by masturbating *a lot* and try to tell myself that just because he doesn't want to bang as much doesn't mean that I'm this fat, disgusting woman ogre that my brain will immediately tell me I am when he rejects me sexually, again. And again. 

At least the wanking does what it's supposed to. 

In all seriousness, it fucking rough. ESPECIALLY as a woman who spends a lot of time on the Internet, where men will re enforce the idea that men want to fuck anyone all the time, and that the only reason they don't is because they're gay or she's fat. 

Visiting /r/deadbedrooms can help. Or make things worse. (They're pretty bitter over there, but at least women post and make you understand that you are not alone.)

It's a fine line addressing your frustration to your partner, as well. Because you should talk to them, obviously. But it's a fine line to just communicate openly about your feelings and adding pressure or them feeling like you're blaming them. 
"
"I've moved a lot- went to 6 different schools as a kid, 7 different countries. Plus side is I'm now really good at figuring people out and making new friends. 

Basically I don't think that question exists, really. People reveal the most about themselves when they feel comfortable and unguarded- and it's unlikely they'll feel this way when asked interview style questions such as, ""What are your hobbies?"" ""What are your life goals?"" or ""Which 3 people would you invite to dinner?"" 

I find that asking people for advice is a better way to figure out values quite quickly. It does several things: makes them feel valued and respected by you, makes them feel more comfortable, and then establishes what they care about the most. If you're new in town, ask them for advice on the best places to go out/things to do.  If you're new at your job, ask them for advice on what to do with a work related problem. You will learn more about their attitudes to work/other people in the company/values than if you asked them straight out. 

"
"That if you receive nude pictures from a person, you're expected to keep them to yourself. 

It hasn't happened to me personally, but I have many guy friends who pass their girlfriend's nudes around like they're hot bread. It's disgusting. "
"Not sex specifically, but I [19/f] am quite young and recently had my first kiss. The dude choked me without asking for consent or discussing it first and I can’t think of any other reason as to why he would have done that if it wasn’t because of porn. "
"- Penetration. There is a lot of porn out there that depicts an above-average bloke bottoming out quicker than the Titanic. You don’t see the prep for it (especially for things like anal), so guys just think it just slides in easily and away they go! Sure, some peeps like it that way, but please don’t try doing your best battering ram impression on my lady parts. 

- Fingering. The whole super-duper-fast-shoving-of-fingers-in-and-out without seeming to be trying to aim for a pleasure spot makes my vagina just want to curl up into my body. 

- Vagina to anal and back again: You need to change condoms each time you switch between pinky and browny. That shit is nasty, yo.

- Thinking that their cock is magically amazing/girls drool over it/that everything is automatically mind blowing simply because you touched me. It’s almost as if those girls in porn are getting paid to act like they enjoy every second... "
"I pack my lunches/dinners for work the night before and set my lunch bag aside with utensils that I’ll need so I can just take my meals out of the fridge and head out the door. 

I pick out my clothes for work the night before as well so I don’t spend time figuring out what I want to wear at 5am, because that never goes well for me lol. 

I’ll force myself out of the house Sunday night if I haven’t gone out the entire day to fill up gas so I’m not worried about an empty tank on the drive to work. 

I also try to follow that 2 minute rule I’ve seen other redditors suggest on here. Where if it’ll take two minutes to do something then just get up and get it done. Incorporating that into my life has done wonders for me."

"He used negging tactics on me.  At the time, i didn't knew what they were since i was getting out of a 14 years relationship, and just thought he was wasting my time.  I walked out when he pointed to a girl in the bar and told that usually he was dating that type but was making an exception for me..."
"Cramps really freaking hurt, man. "
While he's sleeping I stick a small treat in between each of his paw pads

How me wanting alone time is not because I'm not into him anymore
"He's a terrible socializer because he's very quiet and doesn't really talk in group settings.  So he's the WORST to take to any situation where small talk and mingling has to happen, because I can only do so much."
"This was before I was married. He lied about his weight. 


He claimed he was fit. He was, no joke, at least double the weight in his photos.


I was a “skinny shallow b*tch” for rejecting him. 


Weight problems I can deal with. Lying and entitlement I can’t "

"I had a guy who wouldn't quit touching me once.  He wasn't touching say, inappropriately, but I don't like to be touched.  He kept reaching out and putting his hand on my hand or grabbing my arm while he was telling a story or something.  I shrugged him off a few times then started directly saying ""Don't touch my hand like that""  ""Don't grab my arm like that""  ""I don't want to hold hands"".  Eventually, I got up and announced I was leaving."
"* The sexual dysfunction - namely, the guys who can't ejaculate and the guys who can't stay hard unless everything is exactly right. What's weird to me is how multiple guys have been straight-up blase about it like ""yeah I can't cum without porn"" and they think that's normal.

* The aggression. Guys who can only do things fast and hard even when the situation absolutely does not call for it. Guys who slap, choke and spit without any discussion whatsoever.

* The anal. Again, some guys are SO blase about this, and some are very bad about consent.

* *The total inability to share pleasure*. What feels good to them must feel good to you, right? So they don't listen, they don't take feedback, and it doesn't occur to them to actually pay attention to the other person's reactions. They think *women* suck in bed for not screaming with pleasure when the guy is doing nothing remotely pleasurable.

Bad sex is not like bad pizza. It's just bad."
double d's dont mean big. big means big. double ds just mean= a 5 inch difference between the underbust and the bust itself. so if you say damn look at those double d's you most likely are yelling at H's

That I am the authority on my own life and experiences. 
"He can't take anything seriously unless I tell him to, otherwise everything is open for joking about. I was miserably sick last week with a 102 fever and when I told him he was like ""that sounds like a high score"" -_-"""
"I try to call my grandma fairly often. A few years ago I called and she didn't pick up, which wasn't unheard of. But instead of her voicemail I heard what sounded like a big whooshing breath being exhaled and the line went dead. I figured I'd call back later. 

The next morning my dad called me around 7 to say my granddad had passed the previous night, and that I had called while the EMTs were there.

Probably a combination of normal phone bullshit and coincidence, but I'll never forget the sound."
"Taco Bell. It's shit, I know. But there's nothing like it for guilty pleasure."
"Jesus Christ, he choked you during kissing? I honestly fucking hate this world sometimes."
"My dog's name is Sue. I like to replace ""you"" (or similar words) in songs on the radio with ""Sue"" to serenade her.

* You are my Sue-shine, my only sue-shine, you make me happy when skies are grey!

Sometimes they're weird though...

* I'm in love with the shape of Sue! And last night you were in my room, and now my bed sheets smell like Sue... "
Some tend to think foreplay isn't required. 
"It goes one of two ways with me; he rejects me, so I cuddle him and say it's all good, or he rejects me, and I wait for him to leave or fall asleep and then cry about it for a bit. Rejection stings, sometimes you can't help but feel hurt."
"He cares so much for other people to the extent where it REALLY affects him. If one of his friends is stressed out, he'll also be super stressed out and he'll bend over backwards trying to help. He feels things too deeply, and there seems to be no end to his empathy. 

His genuine kindness is such an attractive quality but as someone who's a huge believer in not setting yourself on fire to keep other people warm, it frustrates me to see him doing exactly that."
"I had filled up my car at the gas pump. I went to drive straight ahead to the highway when I heard my dad's voice say ""STOP!!"" Then my car died. A semi truck came speeding through the gas station parking lot never slowing down right in front of me.  It would have hit my drivers side where I was. My dad passed away the year before. I think it was my dad looking out for me. The car never died again. "
"""Why won't any women date me? They must all hate men, that's the problem these days."""
"I went on a date with a guy once to a park. He ended up throwing a baby swing at me while i was on another swing. He did this because he wanted to get on and i wasn’t getting off fast enough.

After i walked away and told him not to contact me, he thought that sending a dick pic would be a great way to say he wanted another date."
"The fact that 98% of ""sports bras"" aren't actually made for sporting in, unless you are flat. This was a real struggle when I went from Sedentary to active and needed good, supportive bras, especially for running.

Thankfully I have found a couple of styles/brands that work for me, and I make sure to spread the knowledge to anyone in need! Unfortunately the one I like the most doesn't make some of the larger sizes. :/"
"He tried to order for me. At a steak restaurant he ordered him a steak and me a salad - no croutons.

Then there was the guy who tried to put something in my drink, and I caught him, and the guy who tried to pull me into the bushes for sex."
"succulents and succulent accessories. 

It used to be makeup but I’ve cut back on that drastically. Tattoos, since I’m getting a big one for my birthday that I can juuust afford but I *need* it. 

Also camping/hiking supplies. If I’m going to REI I know it’s already too late for me. "
"That they aren’t the authority on what is and isn’t sexist.

Survey says that women fucking *hate* catcalling and being strong-armed, chased, and pressured into dates or sexual activity. We’re pretty much unanimously telling you that it hurts us. You don’t get to decide that it doesn’t. "
I hate the expectation that maintaining a clean house is more my responsibility than my male SO's. I don't want to clean any more than he does!
"I had gone on a date, freshly layed off of my somewhat prestigious job in town, with someone who had been trying to date me for a while and I just never had the time to go out. After we got sushi, I went to grab the bill while he was in the bathroom. I put my credit card in the pocketbook and left it on the table for the server to pick it up. He got back, saw I was paying and flipped out. He literally told me, ""I'll pay for this since you're unemployeed. I'm sure your card would have declined anyway.""

I've never felt so humiliated, not for what he said and the way he said it, but for ever agreeing to go on a date with someone SO willing to talk down to me like that. Ugh, I still cringe. "
"I was pretty close out of a break up, and not sure if I was really ready to date. This guy kept trying to get me to down more drinks, letting me know how close the bar was to his place, and trying to get me to make out in public. These aren't my stlye at all. I'm not a huge drinker, I'm not a PDA person... and it wasn't really a date. he was trying to get some. Finally, I literally ghosted. I ran out of the bar and didn't say goodbye because I was getting so uncomfortable, I could tell he was trying to get me drunk enough to agree to sleep with him. It was terrible."
"When raising  new puppy or acclimating a new-to-me older dog we have thunder parties to help prevent or mitigate already developed thunderphobia.  
Whenever there is a thunderstorm we all go out into the yard and sing and dance and they get lots of treats.  
Not with lightning- only thunderstorms.  
If there is lightning we do our thunder partying indoors."
"He was homophobic and thought they should be ""taken care of."" That was a hard pass."
Periwinkle anything. Do I need a 7th lacy bra? No. Will I get it if it comes in periwinkle? Yes. 
"My cat stares out the front window, so I wave to him whenever I leave for work or the gym or whatever."
That I am capable of continuing to carry the heavy thing I am already carrying.
"Yesterday a family member gifted me with a jacket.  When I closed the top button, the jacket like exploded and the button flied across the living room at such a high speed! My 9 year old son saw this and he said:'wow, it's like the launch of a NASA rocket'"
"I feel like if porn didn't exist, people wouldn't throw me around in a gazillion different positions and expect me to have a good time. I also feel like instead of seeming inexperienced or hesitant, guys tend to be overly aggressive, violent, and haphazard in trying to pleasure me because it makes girls in porn moan. So it's a lot of rubbing me in random places, spitting on me, throwing me around, etc. "
"An affordable, high quality, non-sheer white t-shirt! It seems like every single tee anymore is made paper-thin with the expectation that you'll just wear a cami underneath. If it's hot enough for a t-shirt, it's too hot for wearing layers! 

I just want something not x-rated I can wear to work with skirts in the summer. Why does this make me a crazy person?!?!"
"That pregnancy isn’t just maternity leave=vacation and cute baby clothes and getting people to give up their seats on the bus for you. 
It can be emotionally draining, a hormonal and financial whirlwind, and many women face pain, fear, and life-threatening situations while pregnant or giving birth. 

I’ve met men who seem to think getting pregnant and giving birth is a fucking walk in the park. I’m not going to get pregnant just because you think a kid would be cute, and especially not if you then want me to stay at home to take care of a child. "
"Use your fingers to stroke and massage the inside of the pussy. Rhythmically in and out sure but it feels good because of the different sensations you can have as you move your fingers. Massage the labia as you go, stroke the g spot, put your fingers in all the way and apply rhythmic pressure near the top of the vagina, play with the g spot, play with the butthole if she’s into it, gently rub the clit, etc.  fingering is not good when you try to make your fingers into a dick... a dick they are not. Let fingering be it’s own wonderful thing. "
"Dressing like an overgrown child. When on holiday, I’ve seen lots of men (usually American, sorry) wearing big trainers, baggy long shorts and massive t shirts with pictures on, often with a baseball cap. Not a becoming look on anyone. "
"Oh God. The ""birthing hips"" argument for having kids. The majority of women are built for having children! It is kinda part of the deal. This doesn't change the fact that I do not want them. "
"Society expects you to do so, so most of the time you learn to do it because you are judged far more harshly than a guy would be if you don't."
"He told me that the kids Michael Jackson was accused of abusing “brought it on themselves because they were fame whores who would do anything to be famous”. As someone who was abused as a kid and knows I didn’t ask for it in ANY way, I got pissed and left. As I was getting in my car he chased me out and said he “bought me a drink so now I owe him”. I cracked my window, threw out some money, flipped him off, and left. Then I had a good cry over how big a jerk he was and how it brought up bad memories of my childhood. What a jerk!

Edit: gendered putdowns. My bad."
"How exhausting it is to be seen as a sexual object first, and a person second (if at all, really). "
French fries. Give me the 'frites' and give me the mcdonalds fry. 
When they rub your clit like they're sanding down an old piece of furniture. Most men don't seem to be aware that some sort of lubrication is needed and that the clit is a super sensitive area and doesn't require that much pressure. But you see men doing it in porn all the time so I guess they assume we want our clits played with the way a DJ scratches records. 
"2-ish months. I was spending most every night there and he said he would clear me out a drawer in the dresser. Came back after work to the entire dresser, half the closet and a house key. 5+ years later, still doing well."
"OK I guess I have to be the gross person but the underboob sweat is out of control and I don't wear a bra so it's skin to skin contact between my underboob and chest. I usually swipe some deodorant under them IF I can remember but I usually forget and by the end of the day it smells like mustard under there. Then if any boy wants to lift a titty I have to be like ""Please don't' do that, it smells like mustard under there. You would never understand."""
“Those girls that are paid to act like they like sexual things seem to like it”
"Very intelligent and poised.  He is extremely ethical and rational.  He has a mind for facts and will bury you in details.  

He's also the most caring and loving person I know.  He adores kids and is great with them.  

He likes deep conversations and to learn what makes people tick.  He's also weirdly naive about some things, but a huge pessimist. 

He's funny and sassy.  He handles my issues beautifully, and is so supportive.  I'm not sure how many people would completely change their lifestyle for their spouse, but he did it without a word of complaint.  

He thinks I'm the most beautiful woman in the world, which is great, until he's convinced every other man does too, and he lectures me like an over protective dad when I go out because he's worried I'll get raped, murdered, and/or kidnapped.  

He's a feminist, and unafraid to call out shitty behaviors in other men.

Really my only complaint is that if I end up losing my legs to one of my disorders, he said he won't get a backpack and carry me around like Yoda, which is some horseshit. "
"If a shirt isn’t made of a “giving” material, it’s usually huge on my mid section, and looks like I Saran-wrapped my boobs.

"Had a dude slap my face with no warning or asking, and could only finish if he could physically see himself ejaculate. That was a very brief thing. Oh, and also he and a different guy both tried the whole dick-hitting-face thing, second guy also wouldn't shut his mouth about threesomes.

These are all super common in porn, and guys who had little interest in porn never tried/did any of this stuff. They were pretty content with mostly vanilla things. While I don't know the porn consumption habits of one of those two dudes, I know the other one watched it daily and thought asking about anal during the first time was appropriate.

I think high (standard large studio) porn consumption makes these people think that specific kinks/preferences are universal/normal, and that leads to assumptions that I have quickly quashed."
Not respecting boundaries. I think a lot of young women (I know I was bad for this) will excuse behaviour that pushes their boundaries because they don't want to come across as being annoying or uptight or whatever. It's okay to stand up for yourself and ditch the guy who can't respect your boundaries! 
"Literature. I am doing my PhD in a literature subfield, but I still love reading free or cheap ""lowbrow"" books on my Kindle to relax (I also like perusing used bookstores for cheap pulpy-looking paperbacks). As a kid reading for fun and getting fully immersed in a story was one of my favorite activities, but I find I can't do that with the stuff I read for school. If I'm studying a text, I have to pay attention to a million things at once and even though I enjoy the work, it does not exactly lead to mindless pleasure. Plus, I rarely even get to read real fiction anymore. :( So I will go out of my way to read the genre fiction that my colleagues would make fun of.  "
"I went on a blind date with a guy once that bragged about how he didn’t want his cat anymore so he bled, skinned and barbecued him. Apparently the taste was so awful that he threw him away after one bite. If you can laugh about killing your pet and then throwing it away, what would you laugh about doing to me? Nope nope nope "
"Started talking to this guy I met online. He was funny and good looking. We exchanged numbers and texted a lot. It took maybe 2 weeks before we could even set a date. We had plans to meet at a restaurant not too far from us. It was new and we hadn't been there before. The day of the date he asked if he could pick me up instead of meeting there. I figured that since we had been texting and talking on the phone non stop for 2 weeks I was comfortable with that. 

He shows up and I'm a little disappointed in his looks. The online photos were old, and the ones he sent me while texting were obviously from his good angle. 

We are driving to the restaurant and he lights up a cigaratte. ""I smoke, I know I said I didn't on my profile, but I do. Since its my car, I'm not asking if its alright if I smoke in here""  I was stunned. 

We get to the restaurant and they had two parts of the lot. One for valet and the other for parking on your own. He parks in the valet section and completely ignores the kid that was working there and refused to give him the keys. I apologized to the kid. 

Inside the restaurant we had a little wait. Conversation was going well. I should have walked out at that point, but I didn't. We get a table and he tries to play footsy with me. This guy was literally slouched down in the seat so he could do this. He looked ridiculous. I asked him if he was alright because he was sitting weird. Hahaha. 

He excuses himself to the bathroom and when he comes back, he gets close to me and kisses me and tries to stick his tongue in my mouth. I didn't kiss back. He basically kissed my tightly closed mouth and I backed away. He said I was an amazing kisser. 

I excused myself to the bathroom, and he tried to grab me towards him as I walked by. I went to the bathroom, texted my neighbor/friend and said I was walking home. She met me a few blocks down the road and picked me up. 

Oh yeah, I tipped the valet kid because I had a feeling ass clown date wouldn't have done that. "
"Making no effort at all. There are so many men who would be SO much better off if they just made sure their clothes fit properly, wore clothing that was appropriate for their situation, and they got their hair cut somewhere that the stylist can give them something that's in style. "
"Women can´t control when period blood comes, like we can´t just wait till we go tho the bathroom and have it all there, that´s why we use pads or tampons or whatever.
Also just because you sent me an unsolicited dick pic I am now under no obligation to return one, is not ""my turn"".  "
I told him I had to powder my nose. Then I went to the bar and found my waitress and canceled my salad in favor of a steak to go. She put a rush on it and I left before he realized anything was amiss.
I have to sit so close to the steering wheel in my car I’m pretty sure if I ever get into an accident the airbag is going to kill me. 
"I think I was around 16ish and I was hanging out at a friend's house.  It was normal for me to be over there hanging out, even if my friend and I were not actually hanging out together.

So I was wandering around the back of their house and I found a little door behind a set of hedges.  Not like a tiny fairy door, but like a crawlspace access square door.  The funny thing was, it was not at the ground level, but about 3 feet off the ground.  

I had been in this back yard before and been all over this house and this door should not be there.  If it went inside, it would open up to the back wall of the garage, and that had been converted into a small workshop room.  And there was no door from the inside.

Being a curious girl, I pried that door open and looked inside.  It was a dark and sealed up room.  The floor looked like it was dirt, but there was a couple pieces of furniture inside.  Against the far wall, which was the front of the house, a table/workbench was set up with two chairs tucked neatly under it.  I also remember a dresser or an armoire turned around so the drawers faced the wall.

There was also some cardboard boxes and odds and ends scattered around, but everything had years of dust coating it, so with it being dark as coal, it was hard to tell what was what.

But, there was something written on the wall above the workbench.  It was two words and I am certain the first word was ""JACKET"" and the second word was something that looked like ""fee"" maybe.  I could not make it out as well.

I reached inside to feel for a light switch, but could not feel one, although I did see a bare bulb hanging down.  I noticed my hands had been covered in dust from the wall.  Althought about it, I not crawl inside, as I lacked a flashlight and wanted to tell someone so they could help me in.  I left the door open and ran back inside to get my friend.

He did not believe me but he still followed me outside.  When we got to the backyard, I peeked back the hedge it was behind and it was completely gone.  

The door was just simply not there.  I knew exactly where it had been, but it refused to re-exist for me.  My friend wandered back inside while I ran around the house a few more times looking everywhere for this damn portal.

Alas, it never reappeared.  But, my hands still had the dust on it from reaching inside for the switch.  It was not the dirt that was outside, but clearly different dust.

I have no idea what I saw, but I am now glad I did not crawl inside.  At the time it was not scary, but now, thinking back, it is terrifying to think about."
That's a really good question I would have no idea how to answer.
"""Oh well good to know, you can go ask her out while I get out."" (zooom) "
"My parents want me to find myself a husband who will make more money than me, be more educated than me, etc.

"Naples, Italy. Hands down. It was utterly disgusting. Condoms and needles everywhere on the ground and everything was super seedy. We'd travelled a lot and felt safe everywhere. But that was a hard no in Naples. It was a place that just felt wrong. 
Everywhere else we went in Italy was totally beautiful though.

Edit: so this comment got unexpected traction, it was interesting hearing that I'm totally not alone and hearing your stories. Here's my story about Naples that years and years later I still cannot shake.
We'd been in Italy a couple of weeks and we're kinda over carbs. I didn't want to spend too much time trawling through the city finding a place that would do a good salad. Most of the restaurants we walked by had all these lecherous men hanging out the front openly gawking at me. So we decided McDonald's because it might have even been safer. Yes, I went to a McDonald's just to get a salad haha. So we're upstairs eating our meal and I turn around and there's a 40 something guy sitting there with who I think is his Mother. She seems like she's had a tough life. I think, 'man, they're sitting kind of close.' 
I got back to eating my salad. Then I turn around again.  They are aggressively making out. Like a starved dog eating dinner. And she's just blankly putting up with it. I'm all for people loving who they want to love. But that's not what this seemed like. To this day it remains one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen. The woman must have been 70 or so.

Anyway, that why I'm never going back to Naples.

"I went on a date with a man who legitimately believed the moon was fake and put there by either aliens or the U.S. government. He also believed that there was a hole to the center of the Earth in Antarctica and that was why all the princes and kings were going there. 

It was technically our second date. He held in the crazy just long enough for round two and I noped out of there quick. "
Cheese
He farts a lot lol. 
"Five minutes after we ordered drinks he announced he is looking for a woman he can father children with.  My child was in highschool and my baby making days behind me.   He looked heart broken when I told him and then he said no use continuing the date then.

Nope no point at all.   I feel like the thought he was seriously looking to father children should have been part of his dating profile."
"I Lemon-Law'd a guy once. Not interested in dating anyone with kids, and that was very clear. He had them, and snuck that fact in about halfway through the date. So I paid for us both (didn't want the waitress to take the brunt of this guy's bad judgment), politely explained why I was leaving, and left. "
"I know that this may be the OPPOSITE of what you’re asking but I scaled down my appearance. I used to spend hours getting ready each morning...full face of makeup, flat ironing hair, picking a perfect outfit, making sure nails/eyebrows/etc looked good.
I decided to challenge society’s beauty standards and I stopped wearing makeup, let my natural hair flow, and put on simple/comfortable clothing and shoes. I used to spend 3hrs getting ready and now I spend 40min. I also stopped doing things like getting my nails done and shopping all weekend and that has saved me an immense amount of time and energy and MONEY.

Now, I have time to go to the gym or on a run outside in the morning. I have more time to spend with friends on the weekend. I can leave the house impromptu without having to prepare for 2-3hrs first. My day used to stop when my makeup came off and now it NEVER stops :)"
"Men expect choking, anal, face fucking, slapping, spitting, facials, and degradation, and if you are not into those things, you're considered ""boring"". Also, you're never supposed to even have a conversation about these things, they're just done without asking. Sex seems to be something that is done to women rather than something women are doing with men. Also, a lot don't seem to realize that female bodies come in a lot of varieties. We don't all have bleached assholes, we aren't always perfectly shaved, labia can stick out, etc. Breasts aren't usually perfectly round, sometimes they're two different sizes, large ones don't sit straight up on your chest when you lie down... 

It's a real problem. I find this to be mostly an issue with younger men - it seems like men who are a bit older and didn't grow up with the porn access that men now have are less likely to think that's how sex could go down. I've slept with older men who definitely had kinks, but they knew to *ask* first and they also didn't just assume that all women are into it. "
"Guy asked about my job, I told him that I'm a teacher and he said he ""just hadn't ever met any teachers that were smart people."" And that all the ""girls"" he knew that where teachers ""are dumb and ditzy."" F*ck you very much and bye!"
Coffee. I'm not gonna pretend I know the difference between fancy stuff and McDonalds.
"I was staying with two friends of friend’s family in Switzerland when I developed a UTI. Both were men, and I felt deeply uncomfortable mentioning this. It was also my first UTI, so I figured if I chugged enough water it would be fine. On the worst day, I took a two hour train ride from this small Swiss city to Geneva, than a flight to Madrid. 

I got off that plane, immediately got into a taxi, started crying and asked in broken Spanish for the driver to take me a hospital. I wanted to die I was in so much pain. 

I got to this hospital, a good distance outside of Madrid, and it was HUGE. I walked into emergency, could only articulate “tengo mucho dolor” (I’m in a lot of pain) and finally a man who spoke English offered to translate for me. We awkwardly established that it was vaginal, and they directed me to the maternity waiting room which was basically across this huge campus.

I get THERE, and only one nurse spoke English, so I went through the whole rigamarole again. Receptionist was clearly uncomfortable. I had no idea where to go and where I was going. Finally, after three hours of waiting in a room exclusively with young glowing pregnant women and searing pain in my urethra, the doctor told me I had a UTI and gave me a prescription. 

The plus side was that when I asked if I owed anything, he gave me a weird look and asked me why I would need to pay anything. So that was nice."
yesss the constant position changes. let's just get it right and stick to it pls
That women play video games too. 
"I haaaate that “bad sex is like bad pizza” rhetoric. Like when it’s bad, it’s fucking horrible and makes you want to never leave a shower and makes you regret everything. "
"Im a 35 year old child free woman who recently just started dating again.  I feel like, because of my child free status, I have become a sort of pied piper for twenty-something men.  I'm not looking for anything serious, so despite my better judgement, I'm actually really enjoying myself.  Younger guys somewhat impress me.  I talk to guys my age too but most of them are speed courting and looking for families.  "
"Hah, I can relate. 5 minutes into a story about him going to the grocery store and gets offended when I try to nudge him to get to the point."
"Holding babies. It makes me stressed. Everyone seems to think that because I’m a woman, I must like babies, but I avoid it wherever possible. Not easy when you’ve got 12 nieces/nephews, but I’ve given it my best effort. "
Own your mistakes. Keep your private life private. Don't date coworkers
"Any reality tv. The more dramatic and ridiculous, the better. "
"Don't feel bad about having standards. You don't need to date a dude just because he meets the basic requirements of living in civilization, no matter how attracted he is to you, if you're not attracted to him."
My husband did that on our first date and continues to do it now we're married. It's never failed to make me laugh. 
"I had a dream that my grandmother was at the base of my stairs in an emerald green dress looking quite young and staring right at me. I was 16 at the time.

The next day we got the call. She had passed. The weird part was that her wedding dress was emerald green. I didn’t know until she passed."
"YES. My fiance has said to me, ""You just do whatever you want, don't you?"" 

How is this bad?

 I certainly try not to do things I don't want to do."
"I was on a date with a guy who started off with a “I like you because you aren’t like other girls,” statement. Red flag. I called him on it. “Oh no, no!” He then tried to play it off. Within the first 30 minutes he had called his mom and his sister bitches, made a sexist joke, and told me he wished he didn’t have to pay for dinner for me to fuck him. Buddy that was never going to happen in the first place! When he told me he stole his ex girlfriends dog for a week to scare her into thinking he had ran away, I didn’t even bother being verbally argumentative back. I told him he was super fucked and got up and left. He texted me after and said, “what are my chances of a second date ;)” and then he was blocked. "
"My ex used to yell at me, ""you're only arguing because you think you're right!""

Why else would I argue???"
That I don’t wear makeup for them so saying they like minimal makeup on me/ other women is not a compliment or advice. 
"India is not a place I have any particular interest in visiting again. I enjoyed much of it but the harassment was nonstop and particularly gross, even by the standards of what I usually hear. "
I think it should be the kid's choice when they're older. Piercing-free here and I'm so glad. My skin and hair type would make pierced ears a nightmare. 
"As for myself, skincare. 

I tanned throughout high school / college and deeply regret it as I now see the way it has made my cohorts age (who still routinely visit the tanning bed), as well as the rise in skin cancer. 

It’s a mixture of turning back the clock and a self-care. There’s something therapeutic about doing the research on actives, pH, and acids, putting together a solid regimen, and then having all the pretty potions arranged neatly on one’s vanity, knowing that it is all self-care. I always look forward to both waking up in the morning and taking off my makeup at the end of the day as I know I’ll feel pampered and almost... “fancy” when dipping into my oils and serums. 

It sounds strange and is strange. It’s the little things. "
"Dressy blouse, skinny slacks, fun colorful flats is my go to each day. 

I use Threadup to get higher end pieces from Banana Republic and J Crew for cheap. "
"Bounced from a coffee date because dude legit could not hold a conversation. Every word was like pulling teeth. That, and when he DID talk it was about his nutty baby mama. 

Had another date where the guy showed up with a mullet, which was NOT in the pics— which, looking back, may have been high school pics and he was early 30’s. 

Another guy, met at his house (I KNOW). He wanted to show me his dungeon in the basement. I feigned forgetting a bottle of booze in my car, and bounced. "
Fast fashion. I'm aware of the ethical and quality concerns but I also like how accessible certain styles have become due to fast fashion and how it's easier and cheaper to experiment with trends. 
"My SO and I wash the poopy butt of one of our chickens weekly. I hold her facing me (the entire time massaging her behind the wings area and talking to her softly in a sing-song voice reminding her how much I love her) while my SO cleans the butt, we rinse off her behind and dab it dry, then give her mealworms. It's our Sunday routine. She's generally healthy, but for some reason she just gets poopy."
"Yeah, he did it twice before he got the message that I wasn’t into it. He laughed it off like it was some kinda joke and continued to put me in headlocks while “cuddling.” Needless to say we split up after two months lol"
"I'm an end-of-life doula. I became very close to a husband and wife as he was dying from cancer. I visited him every week and when we reached the end his wife decided that she wanted to remember him in life and not in death. So I told her it was now my job to be with him during his last breath. I spent many many hours sitting vigil by his bedside at hospice.  And I was there when he died like I promised I would be.

After his funeral, I stopped at the grocery store, and as I have been doing for years I looked into one of those bins of Cokes with names on them looking for my name or my husband's name. After all these years I have never found either one. But there at the bottom of the nearly empty barrel were my patient's first and last names right next to each other. I'm not superstitious and yet it made my heart race and gave me chills. I bought them and they still sit on my fridge overlooking my kitchen."
"Within 5 minutes of sitting down; having just met: ""So... are you fertile? Have you checked? Done tests? Because I need to know that the woman I have an interest in is in fact fertile and fit to carry my children."" Couldn't really walk out, per se, as it was a private party, but did my best to avoid him the rest of the evening."
"What feminism is. No, it's not about hating men, jfc.

In this sub, in particular, that women are individuals. Over the years it's been shocking to me just how many men toddle in here thinking women are, basically, at our cores, the same. Thinking we can all interpret each other's unspoken words, or that there are a simple set of steps that will cause an intended outcome on virtually any woman. "
"Shirts/tops with buttons. I keep having to check buttons are fastened. Also, if a shirt fits in the bust, it will swamp the rest of me. Buying dresses can be a horror show. Boobs ache when they bounce around too, so sports bras are a necessary evil. They can get in the way when you’re doing stuff like reaching for something in an inaccessible place, or even playing piano. "
"And that sex doesn't always help. I don't know where they got this information, but I've been told by several partners that we should have sex if I'm cramping because it will totally help. I really believe that my current sweetheart was trying to help when he said it, so I (hopefully) gently explained that I was physically uncomfortable and mentally feeling very unsexy, and while it's possibly true that an orgasm might loosen things up a bit there was no way I was game to try. "
"1. Pick out your outfit/lay it out for yourself the night before. 

2. Meal prep; cook/prepare food on Sunday/whenever you have free time so that you’ll have meals and snacks ready for the week/when you can’t be bothered to cook. 

3. Make a “to-do” list of things you need to get done for the next day/week the night/week before, so when you wake up in the morning, you’ll know exactly what you need to get done/what to dedicate your time to. I like using apps on my phone since the list is easily accessible to me wherever I go. 

4. I wash my hair at night (it’s far too long and thick for me to wash in the morning and wait for it to dry) and put it up in a bun (pretty much every night) before I sleep. In the morning, it’s tangle-free and wavy and I don’t have to do anything with it except fluff it up. 

5. I keep a gratitude journal aka “Five Minute Journal” and I write in it right before bed as well as when I wake up. It doesn’t necessarily contribute to making my life easier per se, but it does help me start and end my day off on a positive note; which I think is super important. 

I’ll add more if I can think of them! "
"Went on a date to a party with the dude. He introduced me around. I left him for a second to go to the restroom. When I returned I overheard he and another guy debating who would get to take me home that night, like it was just their choice who to pass me around to. I got my things and left without saying goodbye. As I was leaving the police were coming to break it up, so karma. Luckily it was only a 20 minute walk back to my apartment. "
"What job would you want to have if the salary was the same for every job?

If someone says a semi-ridiculous job 'Ice cream taster' or 'Porn star oiler' you now know that they have a good sense of humor and also know how to deflect.

Some people say they love their current job and will tell you about it.

Others will launch into how they'd make their hobby they enjoy a career and be a park ranger, makeup artist, nat geo photographer, or whatever and tell you about what inspires them."
"I had just graduated high school, and would stay out until 2-3 in the morning during that summer before college. I was seeing someone at the time, and it was common for me to be out with him and then return to my parents’ house for the night. One night I got back home (in the country—middle of nowhere) and just stood next to my car in the driveway looking up at the sky. It was completely clear, stars were very bright against the blackness. It was beautiful and I wanted to soak that in. 

As I walked inside, my mom had heard my car pull up and came out. She said, “Where is Will?” I replied that he was at his house. She then said “Oh I thought he came home with you. I saw someone standing by you in the driveway.”"
"He's a really laidback and chill guy, sweet, caring, funny, goofy and always cheerful. But at the same time he's highly motivated, smart, ambitious and dedicated. 

He has pretty nerdy interests, he taught himself to code and now works as a software dev/partner manager, he likes videogames and boardgames, he watches anime. He's really into baking bread and keeps a sourdough going which he's pretty proud of, he's always trying to up his bread game. He's also very outdoorsy, does a ton of exercise (running and cycling every day), loves going fishing and camping. "
"That’s hilarious, I like him "
That when I bring up something they said that made me uncomfortable isn’t me trying to change you or sugar coat your speech. it’s that you should be considerate of peoples emotions and how you word and say things. Not everything that comes to mind should be said out loud.
I think that dates way back pre-Internet. Pre-computers probably. Possibly pre the wheel. 
"“Why can’t we just have normal sex for once?” As his palms are faced up in show of despair. 

“Normal sex?”

“ANAL SEX!” As his foot stomps on the ground. 

uh wat. ?¿ 

Same guy also tried “accidentally” sticking it in my ass the first week we started having sex and for several weeks after that until I put a very firm stop to his “ooooops sorrrryyy” probing. This “normal sex” comment was after dating for awhile. "
"At a gig you can *guarantee* that even though you've been in your spot ages, the tallest fucker in the entire room will show up late, barge through the crowd to their pals and pick the spot right in front of you as their standing spot."

"That gender discrimination is still a thing, even if women can vote, own property, etc."
"It is true within that relationship, and likely a good indicator of later relationships, as well. 

If Jon and Jane are dating, and Jon cheats on Jane, he will cheat on her again if she chooses to take him back. He has already proven he does not respect her or the relationship, and there is no going back from that. It is dead. 

Now, one week after Jane dumps his ass, Jon starts dating Joy, saying he's a changed man. Well, odds are he's going to cheat on Joy, too. I'd bet on it, tbh. If I was Joy, and knew what Jon had done to Jane, I wouldn't give him the time of day. But that's me. So that's how that one will go.

Now, six years later, Jon cleaned up his act, has had a stable and consistent job, is building a great career, and completely gave up the party life by his own volition. He meets Julie at a fundraiser and they really hit it off, building a friendship and then beginning to date. Jon might just be a better person, now, and he may not cheat on Julie. 

SO... once a cheater, always a cheater is true within the relationship and relationships immediately surrounding it. If there is a big time gap and major changes take place during that time gap, then perhaps the person has grown up and will not be a piece of shit cheating scumbag anymore and then Jon and Julie can maybe, MAYBE live happily ever after.

The End :)

"I got a PhD in physics and then walked away from academia. Grad school was a ton of fun and as good a place as any to weather the 2008 recession (they pay you in the hard sciences, not much but it's a living), but I balked at the prospect of bouncing from high-pressure postdoc to high-pressure postdoc for a couple years and then starting tenure track.

My thinking when I started the PhD program was that I would ride the science train until I wanted to get off, and hope that a PhD in physics would qualify me for the sorts of jobs where they want to hire people who know how to think and provide specific training on top of that, which does seem to be the case. I got a job as a software engineer without any software engineer training or experience and have been enjoying it so far."

I've had a man tell me that it didn't happen at my former company because he wasn't aware of it. After I informed him of it, his response was ""why didn't you tell anyone about it?"" Because no one would have believed me and I wanted to keep my job."

White rice. Fucks up my stomach. Has barely any nutritional value. Can't not eat it if it's in front of me.
"I live abroad so I only go visit my family a few times a year. This summer, the day after I'd arrived for a visit my mum asked if I wanted to go see my grandmother in the nursing home, since mum had to drop off some clothes for her anyway. I said sure, I hadn't planned on it but was happy to come along. My grandmother had severe dementia at the time, and she didn't recognize anyone anymore, and could barely talk.  I sat with her, held her hand for a long while; she grabbed it and held on for a long while, and whenever I let go she'd try to grab it again. Then suddenly, in a much clearer voice than she'd had in months, she said ""It's better where Roger is. It's better where he is, isn't it?"" Roger was my grandfather, who had died a year and a half before that. I said ""yes, it is"", because she was in a lot of pain, and suffering so much. 

After a while we left, I said goodbye, as I wasn't sure she'd still be here the next time I was in the country. But as soon as we got home we got a phone call from the nursing home, asking my mother to come back, right away. She died about an hour later.

It felt so strange, because I'd just decided on a whim to go see her sooner than expected, and even though she was in a bad way, no one had expected her to die just yet. My mum said that she'd waited until she'd seen me one last time... The fact that she asked about my granddad does make me think she was getting ready to go.

It was all really weird and confusing... But I'm glad I got to see her and hold her hand before she went."

"1. Setting up an automatic coffeemaker every night. I’ve got it timed to start brewing about 5min before my alarm goes off...there are mornings when the smell of fresh coffee wafting into my bedroom is the *only* reason I can get up and face the day.

2. Putting a gym in the basement. A couple years back, we decided to give up our gym memberships and buy a treadmill and a few weights, a bosu, etc. Both my husband and I are getting vastly more exercise than we would if we had to drag ourselves to the gym in the winter. And in just two years, the cost of the treadmill equaled what we would have paid in gym memberships- we’re now on our fourth year with it, so essentially we’re saving about USD 200/month by having our own little gym. And we’re significantly fitter.

3. Only keeping people in my life who matter to me. One of the most life-changing things I’ve ever done was realize that no, just because I was friends with someone for two years, doesn’t mean I have to be friends forever with them if they actually are a toxic, negative person. Cutting people out of your life is easier said than done, but once you do make the decision it is so, so much better. And you have more time and energy to focus on the people who truly are important."
"He told me I was trying to emasculate him because I wore shoes that made me taller than he was. We had spoken online before going out and he knew I was tall and said he was really into that. By no means was I trying to do anything other than wear a new pair of sandals I had bought that I thought would look cute with my outfit. He offered to drive me home so I could change my shoes. I told him no and that the date was over, dropped some cash on the table and left. He hounded me with messages after that. I didn't read a single one and just ended up blocking him. "
"I don't deal with it very well at all. I try to take the pressure off him by masturbating as much as I possibly can but in all fairness I still crave the intimate physical contact with another human being. 

Being rejected hurts a damn lot especially when it feels like almost every time. Once a week just doesn't cut it for me, and that's usually the rate that we are currently at. 

I feel like I have to beg him before I get it, I'll ask, ill try to get him excited for sex, and I've tried everything I could possibly think of including dressing up and being forward with him. I've talked to him about it and he knows how it makes me feel. I tried the suggestions he gave me himself with no success.

I get very emotional when I don't get that need filled. That ranges from sadness/crying, to anger and frustration. 

As women we're told that if our guy doesn't want sex with us then it's our own fault for being bad at it, or too fat, or something about our physical appearance. Were told that men want sex all the time and jump at every opportunity you give them, but that's not entirely true. 

Honestly, it makes me feel like a total failure because I can't give my guy that pleasure. It makes me feel gross and ugly and worthless; even if he tells me everyday that he loves me and thinks I'm beautiful. 

It's tough. "

"100% this. Or thinking that oversized jeans and t-shirts are concealing body parts they’re uncomfortable with.  My boyfriend is pretty overweight for his height, but he wears clothing that fits his body well.  Yes, yo I can sometimes see his beer gut, but the overall effect makes him look much slimmer than he is.  An oversized T-shirt maybe would hide the gut, but it would make his whole top half look larger and wider than he actually is.   Baggy jeans would make his butt look larger.   People are always surprised when they find out how much he weighs because he doesn’t look it.  "

I got stuck on a mountain in Iceland in a rental car.  We had to call emergency rescue.  It took them three hours to find us in brutal cold (reindeer were roaming past us for part of the time).  Then another hour to get the car out of the snow it was stuck in.  Then we had to follow them back to town (40km) and stay there for the night.  
"An old roommate and ex-friend of mine. Our friendship was ruined because of how cheap she was. 

Me and this stingy roommate lived in a house together during university with a mutual friend. Mutual friend and I provided ALL communal furniture, and virtually all the kitchen utensils. Roommate also generously drove us for groceries and never asked for gas in return. 

Stingy roommate would liberally eat mine and the other roommates food. Anything from ketchup, to frozen fruit, to parmesan cheese. Her signature move was to leave the teeniest tiniest amount of food left in a bottle so that she wouldn't be blamed for finishing something. 

I asked her for a granola bar one time. She demanded that I compensate her $3 for it. Roommate and I asked her to purchase a plunger when our toilet got backed up. She wanted to split the plunger 3 ways. (it would come to $2 each) She had a white board in her room where she would write down names and how much money they owed her. She would refuse to pay gas whenever she 'borrowed' (without asking her) my roommates car to run errands. 

Her parents were paying for her tuition and rent, so it wasn't like she had to penny pinch. But the best part is that she worked as a waitress, and would send us pictures every night of bills upon bills to brag about how much money she was making. 

Never encountered someone like that in my life before.

"When I was maybe fourteen, I found an old set of books at a thrift store. They looked amazing, and I convinced my mom to buy them for aesthetic purposes. I put them on a shelf I had hanging over my dresser. I don't remember when it started, but the books would shoot off the shelf. Not fall, literally shoot. The first time it happened, I walked into my room to see one of the books on the ground next to my bed (on the other side of the room). Whatever, put it back, went to bed. When I woke up, it was on the floor again. 

I tried to recreate it. When I knocked something off the shelf (and these books weren't even on the top where they could simply fall over), it would land on my dresser. Or directly in front of my dresser. Once when my grandmother visited and stayed in my room, she came to breakfast saying, ""How funny, I woke up to one of your books on the ground!""

The real kicker came when my mom went into my room and actually saw the book launch off the shelf. I never saw it happen, only the aftermath, but she claimed to witness it. She freaked out. I am SURE there is another explanation, but it was crazy how far the book would fall from the shelf. We ended up putting the books in a closet after she saw it happen, and I assume they're tucked away in her basement now."

"I think a lot of the issue is with people thinking that their clothes are sending one message when they are clearly sending another.

Guy sees woman at bar, she's wearing a pencil skirt, button down blouse, and low heels. She's a professional coming from the office for happy hour with her coworkers.

He thinks 'I'm super fly, I'm going to go talk to you, buy you a drink'. 

Man approaches woman. He's a software developer/IT guy/mechanical engineer. She sees him wearing ill fitting jeans and a graphic tee with some slip on, square toe shoes he got because 'Vans aren't business casual' as his boss told him. 

She says 'Sorry I'm here to meet my office mates.'

Guy says sorry and leaves to wait for his wings on the other side of the bar with his buddies.

Office lady looks back at dude, and thinks to herself 'He seemed nice but what would my coworkers think if I was flirting with some guy that looks like he's going to a high school LAN party?'

Guy thought he was fine because he was meeting 'the minimum'. Clean clothes, showered that morning, applied pants, t-shirt with witty phrase on it his co-workers laughed at with him."
It's an oversimplification but unless they change the behaviour/traits that lead to the cheating it's usually true.

"Cambodia. It's a shame because the people were lovely and there is a terribly sad history, and tourism money would, in an ideal world, bolster the economy and help the needy. But it is incredibly corrupt, anywhere touristy you go, you pay an entrance fee to soldiers/government officers (often $30USD) and know that the locals get nothing. There was rubbish everywhere, plastic bags littered the fields, and children are sent to beg instead of going to school. The begger children without parents have pimps, so any money you give them they also dont keep. The fat tourist in the hotel room next to me has what looked like an underage prostitute staying with him. A horribly depressing experience, I felt so helpless in the face of that much misery, knowing that the government and corrupt official's greed kept the place like that."
"She saved my life. I was on a downward spiral. I was very overweight, dating a man (her 'father') who was extremely handsome, but also very abusive and dangerous. I was a binge eater (one day = dozen donuts, loaf of bread, A CAKE) and was financially crippled. A good friend of mine found who 'knew' about him had found out I was seeing him and provided some much needed information (he used to be a stripper, had been to jail, and had a pregnant ex girlfriend whom he met in rehab). All this information and I continued to see him. I was fat, and he was beautiful. I found out about my daughter. ""Shit. Life is serious, and I'm out of control"". I told him about the pregnancy, and promised I would not inform his ex girlfriend and would never seek him out for child support if he simply left us alone. I completely turned my life around during those 9 months. Clean eating, got financial help, sought counselling and went from 190lbs to 130lbs 1 year after finding out I was pregnant. I met a man when my daughter was 6 months old, we married 18 months later and he asked my daughter (who was 2 when we married) if she would like to call him Daddy. She hugged him and said yes. 15 years later she is the light of my life. My husband is someone I NEVER EVER would have married, let alone dated if I hadn't had the motivation of my daughter / pregnancy to clean up my life. It was a tough choice to keep her. She honestly saved my life. She gave life meaning. "

"As a guy, I assume the dudes on the internet that act like they want nothing but sex all the time probably don't often have many, if any opportunities to actually have sex.

It's a little strange going from single and constantly wanting it to meeting someone, having a lot of sex, then realizing it actually requires a fair amount of energy and sometimes I'm just tired."
"I just started laughing really.  I found it mostly ridicule.  It had been an escalation during the 20 minutes it lasted.

I had made a profile on a random dating site, on which it was clear i was fat, played video games, loved the city, was a teacher at the moment and enjoyed reading.  Also my age at the time (mid 30s).  I had paid a babysitter to be there and since the guy was close to his 40s, i was not expecting such a waste of my time.

He started by telling me he wasn't into intellectual hobbies, and usually didn't date intellectual people, because he didn't think they were interesting.  Then added that video games were for kids.  Then went on to tell me that all his gf had been in their early 20s, into sports, but that he was giving me a chance.  The complete opposite of me, of my pictures or my very honest profile.  It was my first date in over a decade, and I was seriously wondering why he was making us waste our times.  Then decided he was a moron and left.  And removed him from my contact list on the website.  

Funniest part: He tried to add me back the next day, because we were a good match...

"I spent 3 months in India - the people I met were some of the friendliest And most awesome folks. But it is a total different experience for women (I’m a guy). One of my friends was there and she carried around a safety pin in her hand to prick groping hands when walking in public. 

Not to mention all the horrible things that go on there (this was somewhat around the time the woman was raped in the bus, and when a journalist was raped as well).  Then there were constant stories of women who had acid thrown on their faces, etc. 

I feel that India is  trying  to figure out the merging of two cultures - the very traditional and conservative India and the one that embraces globalization (and female empowerment with it). Unfortunately this merging can clash violently.

I was falling asleep.  When I felt something grab my facial cheeks.  I thought my mom was having some moment of crisis because the way it felt, it felt desperate or frantic. 

So I stayed quiet and hoped she’d get a grip and go to sleep.  After what felt like a few minutes, I became annoyed because I was really sleepy and wanted to sleep.   

I yelled out, stop touching me!  

I noticed in that instance no one was touching me.  I looked back, my mom was asleep and on the furthest side of the bed.

"My best mate had a disaster of a day.

She hated her hair but was too short on time to do much about it.  Her shoes rubbed all day. 

There was a thunderstorm during the ceremony, which was in a large room with huge double glass doors along the walls- they were shaking and rattling with the wind.  Thunder was rumbling as they said their vows. Actual lightening during the “does anyone object bit” - like God(s) objecting to the union. 

Then the DJ turned up but had forgotten his box of modern music and none of the copied mix cds the groom had made would play on his kit. So we were all grabbing cds from our cars to play during the reception. 

Best Man brought a new GF along, they argued all day. Another engaged Groomsman had previously had a fling with someone else in the wedding party, it was joked about over dinner - his fiancée didn’t know and was more than a little peeved. Brides little nephew threw up on the dance floor just before first dance. 

They’d been told they were the only wedding at the hotel (exclusive). However turned out another wedding party were staying at the hotel. That party had got married late in the day and had a dinner elsewhere, turning up mid evening to use the large communal bar like their own reception venue. Hotel knew this was their plan and didn’t tell my mate. 

And also as the buffet opened the three tier wedding cake, which was centre of the display,  collapsed under its own weight. 

It’s been more than a decade and the couple are still together. Still happy and have lovely kids. 

We say they got all the bad luck out the way on that day.

"I was 12, and we had a ""girl time"" class, when the teacher divided us by girls and boys to talk about puberty, I guess. Worth noting is that I was the only girl at the time who'd started getting pimples. So we're sitting there, twelve girls and our teacher, and she says: ""does anyone know why we get pimples and acne during puberty?"" and one girl looks straight at me and says: ""it's because you're dirty and doesn't clean yourself"".

I still hate her."
"For most men this has not been an issue.. Until late 2016 when I dated a porn addict. Any time we talked about a female he would have to mention their attractiveness, even if the conversation had nothing to do with that. (Ex. Me: I like watching Rhonda Rousey fight, she's totally badass. Him: Yeah, she's pretty hot.) He was absolutely terrible in bed. He would try weird positions for one that were extremely uncomfortable. And due to his lost sensitivity, he would do this really fun thing I like to call ""the jackhammer."" I have thankfully never been sexually abused, but after that experience I can absolutely imagine the horror of it. In many ways it felt like sexual abuse, like I was being used as a sex toy that didn't experience pain, because man it was painful as hell. 

Luckily, most men in my experience have not been this severely affected by porn, and still have the physical ability to have normal sex, and the emotional and mental capacity to treat women as human. He was the exception, not the norm."
"Ewwww! I also know a 26 year old dude who's dating a 17 year old. His last girlfriend was 16 when they got together, and I think he was about 24 at the time. I don't get it! What do you even have in common with someone so young?? 

I've been with someone who's 34 while I'm 25, sure. But the differences there didn't feel quite as powerful. (And it's legal, minor detail)"
"Basically, my friend told me one day that her friend really liked me, so she set us up on a date.

I turned up, we talked for a while and he started asking questions that didn't apply to me. He asked about a subject I wasn't studying, a sister I didn't have and other weird things. I think he thought I was winding him up when I told him the truth.

Eventually it clicked in my brain and I asked whether he thought I was someone else. He did. He wanted to continue the date but it was just too awkward.

The weirdest part was that he had clearly had conversations with this girl and had laid eyes on her before, so I don't understand how he didn't notice. 

I sometimes jokingly blame my friend for it all but she says he picked me out in front of her to tell her he liked ""me"" and that it's my fault for having a clone.

"I really don't like it for personal reasons.  I hate it, I think it's not a kind thing to do to a child.  If anyone ever asked me whether or not they should do it I would tell them not to repeatedly.

As a teenager and adult I've refused to have my ears pierced.  It started out being because I was afraid of pain and infection, but sort of turned into defiance, and now that I'm an adult on my own it's just not something I want.  When I was a teen-young adult, this infuriated my mother, because I can't wear earrings, or inherit her earrings.  She'd often tell me she wished she'd had my ears pierced as a baby so I couldn't have refused.  This whole line of argument was really upsetting to me.  Hell, it even got revived when I was 30, my mom begging me to get my ears pierced before my wedding.  No.

As for _banning_ it though, I don't know.  I haven't made a study of it so it's not like I have enough information to decide.  I just don't personally like it."

"When I was in college, two of my friends got married. I couldn't drive at the time, so my dad took me. It was a small outdoor wedding. I told him he could join but he was like ""nah it's nice out I'm just gonna go sit on that bench and chill with my guitar and this book of crossword puzzles.""

Eventually when I go to leave, I say goodbye to my friends and mention that I should get going because my dad's just been chilling in the park, playing guitar or whatever. Friend deadpans and says ""wait, what does he look like?""

Turns out, when my friends went to take pictures off in the park, they happened to pass near my dad. He says to himself ""well gosh, here are two kids my daughter's age wearing wedding gear, bet they're her friends."" So he starts following them around, providing them with some nice background music for their photoshoot.

BUT HE DOESN'T TELL THEM WHO HE IS.

So yeah my dad just creepily serenaded my friends which they enjoyed but come on man."

One day he went around and forced every single coworker to look and ""tell me if her boobs are fake or not. She says they are real but they are too perfect and I don't believe her""


She was also ultra conservative (think like pentacostal).  I chewed him out, but he didn't care. Our boss didn't care.  And I had no way of contacting his wife.  


Just why the hell would you even begin to think that was a good idea?? It couldn't be more clear he had zero respect for her or thought of her as anything other than his object. "

About 8 years later we reconnected on Facebook and we met up to get lunch. At the end of the day, he said he had a great time and wanted to go on more dates. And it was soooo satisfying to turn around and tell him he was a cool guy but a shame as he was the ugliest boy I knew. He went white as a sheet. We didn't really speak again after that."

3. We will also insult Cat. For some reason, our insults are either berating her for not having a job, or stuff with an Australian accent (we're kiwis). ""Insult Cat with an Aussie accent"" was one of the instructions I left my cat-sitter over xmas.

"I was visiting my friend for the weekend and sleeping over at her apartment. She had a one bedroom, so I was staying out in the living room, where you could see the entire apartment except her room, and she was in her bedroom with the door closed. At least five times I’d wake up wide awake and took awhile to fall back asleep, so I had memorized all the furniture and the shadows from the curtains of the front window being slightly opened where some light was peaking through. 
I woke up again ‪around 5am‬ (it was January so it was still dark outside) and saw my friend in the living room, staring towards the front window (the light coming through the curtains was lighting up her face and torso but her body was slightly behind the couch). I thought she was being super creepy and maybe trying to scare me. Her bathroom was off of her bedroom so she wouldn’t come out to pee, her kitchen was further in the back of the room so she wasn’t grabbing a drink, and her door was still closed. Plus the weirder part was she looked like she was sitting in a chair or something, she wasn’t her normal height, and her hair looked really light instead of her actual dark brown hair. I almost said “Kayla.. what are you doing??” But then I realized “Holy shit that is not Kayla” and in that exact second the girl took her eyes off the front window and looked right at me. I squeezed my eyes shut, I did not want to be there and I can’t believe she looked right at me and we made eye contact. I can still feel how hard my heart was beating in my chest, I think I was having a panic attack. After a few minutes, I decided I had to open my eyes again since there was no way I’d be falling back asleep. I tried to mentally prepare myself - you know when you think you see something but you’re not in a familiar place so really it’s just a chair or some furniture? I figured when I opened my eyes I was going to see something around where the girl had been, like a chair or desk or something. So I thought when I opened my eyes I’d still see something that sort of looked like a girl but I’d be able to figure out what piece of furniture she actually was. But when I opened my eyes there was absolutely nothing there where she had been. I didn’t sleep over the next night - I couldn’t handle being in her apartment any longer. "

He just packed all his stuff while she was at work and left without a word. They were together for 7 years and her kids (from another man) were starting to call him dad. To this day, she still has no idea why he left, but confirmed through family that he is living on his own and just didn't want to get married.

She didn't have time to cancel the wedding entirely because it was all paid for and she wouldn't get a refund. So she went ahead to turn it into a ""dodged a bullet"" celebration. The interesting part was that dude never told any of his guests there wouldn't be a wedding and my co-worker didn't have half their contact info. So his friends still all showed up and she had to get her bridal party to break the news to them."

I used to work at a bar. One night these older white men with what sounded like a New Zealand accent (I was in Texas at this time) came up to me. They asked my name and I’m not sure why I gave them a fake name before having talked to them more but my gut said something was weird about them. They said they were flying to Vegas the next day for the Manny v Mayweather fight and offered me $2k cash up front to be their private bartender on their private plane. I asked them what time and where and said that I had to see if I could call out of my other job the next day first (I wasn’t scheduled at all the next day) and asked for their contact info. They handed me a business card that was for a company that did housekeeping and private bodyguards... the company didn’t show up on google.

"I often \(gently\) use her as a pillow for a few minutes/until she gets fed up with it, or until I get bored.

We keep making more and more ridiculous excuses for why she doesn't have a job. It ranges from things like 'she can't open doors' to 'she doesn't know math' to 'she doesn't understand how phones work'. lmao

My fiance lifts her up under the armpits and goes NAAAAAAAA ZAABENNNYAAAAAA on a regular enough basis that she gets concerned when he tries to pick her up. After he sets her down post\-serenade, though, she always wanders back over to him, so he goes ""Oh, did you want ANOTHER ONE?"" and as soon as he touches her she zooms away. it's funny every time.

I also talk to her constantly as if she's a particularly unintelligent toddler.

Our roommate substitutes the 'zabenya' in the lion king intro with her name often, so when she's derping around he just randomly goes ""Na za\-Freja!"" and it's inexplicably still funny.

"My SO got stuck at immigration on our way back into the US and was unable to communicate with me about it. We expected it to take a little while, but not hours. There was a connecting flight we eventually needed to catch. I kept trying to text him for some information, any information. Silence. I watched time tick closer and closer to our connecting flight departure, feeling more anxious with every minute. I saw people that were in line behind him come out and leave with their families. Then, people I didn’t recognize. Still no sign of him. 
  
I finally got a brief word saying just to leave without him, but I was cutting it really close. Of course, we were in DFW, which has one of the dumbest airport layouts ever. So, I tried to book it from immigration to my correct terminal. It took at least 15 minutes, despite me running as much as I could, since my terminal was on the complete opposite side of the airport. I ended up missing my flight by mere minutes. I was so stressed and had no idea when my SO’d be released. I felt so defeated.
  
Thankfully, we were both able to grab a seat on the next flight out, free of charge, when I explained our situation to the ticket lady. But for those few hours, I felt such misery and turmoil for the both of us. Nothing felt better than finally reuniting with my SO in the middle of that dumb airport. We held each other so damn tight.  It’s an experience I won’t soon forget. "

"Guys in general are horrifically clueless about boobs. I've had several who like overweight women try to body shame me as ""flat"" (as if there's something wrong with that) and say I don't need a bra because I'm an A cup.

Just... no, Bob, honey, AA MIGHT be considered flat. And if a woman was actually flat she wouldn't need a bra to begin with, duh. 

Men understandably do not understand bra sizing but as such, they need to stop pretending they're experts and hitting on any woman who mentions she's a C/D or insulting ones who are smaller. Or better yet, stop acting like anyone cares about your ignorant opinion."

"When I was in elementary and middle school, I got made fun of viciously for having “hairy arms.” It’s sad because I honestly was not aware and did not give a fuck until it was pointed out. I was mocked and called a monkey, the boys would even make monkey noises at me. I never shaved my arms at that age because my parents would’ve killed me. My mom didn’t really understand because she has very fine auburn hair and her body hair has always been mostly invisible. I kind of just sucked it up and told myself “I’m still cute with monkey arms and monkeys are my favorite animal anyway soooo.” haha fake confidence got me a long way. When I got to college I decided to wax them. I didn’t like how from far away in photos, you could still see dark hair on my pale arms. After waxing so many times, I let my arm hair grow out and it’s much finer, softer and lighter than it used to be. 

Edit to add... it’s pretty telling how plenty of boys in my school had just as much arm hair as me and didn’t get made fun of. i wonder when young boys are introduced to the notion that women must be hairless silky dolphins, while men can be as hairy as they please 🤔"
Every summer my parents would yell at my sister and I for not cleaning. We were both full time students but my brother could play video games all day long. My mother would even wash his clothes. Ridiculous.
She said the N-word.  I absolutely will not tolerate that.
They expect unrealistic vaginas and sex and orgasms most of the time  and are upset when they don’t get the unrealistic things. Also men are ignorant about the vagina stretching leading them to think that if a vagina isn’t tight it’s gross.

"I'm currently working in a post-doc. It's pretty good, flexible hours and I get to feel like I'm making a difference. It helps that my supervisor is largely hands off. 

Prior to this I worked in government and lectured. I've been very fortunate, this position literally fell in my lap. There is a glut of PhDs and post-docs are super competitive. Outside of academia a PhD can make you overqualified. And a PhD can destroy your love for a field. 

If you're thinking of a PhD, think about what your end goal is. Do you want to teach? Research? Work in industry? Make a start up? Then talk to people in these positions, ask what they found helpful, what they're looking for when hiring and so on. Then if a PhD is still the path you want be very strict in picking a supervisor, talk to their previous students. A lot of people are great researchers but are absolutely shit (and sometimes maliciously so) at being supervisors. Don't just go with the first person, be choosey, because the risk of burn out is real, and many brilliant people drop out because of toxic work environments."

"We were taking the metro from our original dinner date location to a second place for dessert. In front of dozens of oblivious people in the all but silent metro car, he quietly asked if he could kiss me. I said I’d prefer he didn’t right now, that I didn’t like PDA and I barely knew him. He put his hand on my leg and said in the cockiest voice “are you sure about that?” while leaning in. 

Metro happened to be stopping at the exact second he leaned in. Wasn’t my stop, but I was close to the door and managed to slip out. He didn’t even see it coming. Never looked back. Got out of the station and called myself an Uber back home.

"It's *so* hard finding tops that don't expose a lot of cleavage. If anything has a neckline lower than a crew neck and you have big boobs, it exposes cleavage, so most of the time - especially in the summer - I end up showing boobage and get comments about it.

He's given the option to share that with the employees, but would give everyone a $25 gift card out of it and expected us to kiss his ass in appreciation. 


To give a reference, he wouldn't let me buy $2.00 needles.  The needles we had were from the 80-90s easily and blunt as fuck.  Wouldn't go through embalmed skin for shit, and there's nothing worse than stabbing yourself trying to force it through.

"I’ve been on the other side of the equation. Work stress got to the point where sex was literally the last thing on my mind. My gf would have been forgiven for feeling frustrated. She was very understanding and caring. First, she understood there was a reason for the stress, and gave me some space to deal with it. Not by going away, but by making sure I didn’t have other things stressing me even more. She then helped keep me grounded, ensuring the stress didn’t get out of hand. And when the situation at work normalized again, well, we made up for missed time. It all went well in the end, and 100% of the credit goes to her. She was patient and caring, supportive, and when the situation called for it, she also got me to keep things real. "

"  One night I hung out with my friend and it was getting late so I needed to take a bus to go home. It took an hour or so to get where I lived and the interval of this bus was 30-40min. So I was kinda getting anxious. After waiting a while the bus came. Before getting on the bus, I asked the driver if this bus is going to my town, just to make sure. I already put my right leg on the bus, but this driver just looked at me (his eyes itself made me feel tad uncomfortable) and didn't answer right away. And then he just fucking smiled really creepily. I draw my leg back immediately and he just shut the door withour a word and then drove off. Thinking back, I should have wrote down the number plate but I was kind of creeped out and just standing there, plain dumbfounded. It was just.....a creepy and shitty experience to me

"Indian-American and Mexican-American. There’s a lot of overlap in our food, but our families are completely different. My family is really awkward about showing physical affection, whereas his spends 30 min hugging and kissing everyone before they go to bed."
"To be honest I feel like his flaws, and the flaws in our relationship, are acceptable because I'd rather deal with them than not have him in my life. I know it's worth the effort because I feel like it is; I know we're ""right"" together because we work. That's it, that's where I set my standards.

Unacceptable flaws would be things that seriously detract from my enjoyment of the relationship or things that make me unhappy or constantly annoyed. Being unable to communicate openly, for example, or being a pathological liar. 

My SO takes ages to get out of bed and uses a ton of water in the shower and complains a lot and leaves his dirty clothes all over the floor and would rather leave the dishes until tomorrow, but none of those are dealbreakers to me because they don't affect how I feel about the relationship. It's not like I chose to set those standards; it's how I feel and what I'm fine with.

I've got a ton of flaws too; maybe I should ask him why we're worth the effort."

I don't know what the fuck he wanted.  We did not part on good terms, to put it mildly.  And I don't need to ""catch up"" to know I dodged more than just a decade of punches and thrown lamps; He has four kids with three ladies, twice divorced, and last I heard got fired from Walmart.  "

"I've had men say this to me before, but what they don't understand is women often need a consistent rhythm and friction in a good position for a period of time to get off. Sometimes if you switch too often you're basically ""resetting"" her. If you find a position she's really responding to, you're best off to keep it until she has at least one orgasm or asks to switch. Ten minutes of sex where both people get off is far superior to 30 minutes of sex in which she gets all built up but doesn't get to finish. Most of us don't care how long you can go, we just want a satisfying experience, just like you. :)"

When she was in the army (Israel requires women to serve, too) it was trendy to do seances. So one night, she and her buddies got together and started asking questions.

He did, and his room ended up getting bombed. He passed that day."

Everyone refers to him as an asshole.) started to made fun of the few dark hairs I had around my belly button. (Like 5 hairs. Not even a treasure trail! As a lot of women naturally have...)

I was about to cry but decided that pouring wood glue all over him and his fancy 'Pepe John' outfit was a better choice, even with teacher watching.

Well, the boy ran crying to the sink to wash off and looked at the teacher crying and said "" AREN'T YOU GOING TO DO ANYTHING?!"" 

The teacher, an old Air Force Veteran, said ""Nope. You deserved that because you are an asshole."" And proceeded to shoe him out of the room so he wouldn't get glue in the 'nice sink'.

I once had a fuckdate with a guy I knew to be someone who slept around a lot and who I was certain from the way he texted me would treat me like an objet and then be done with it. Well I was quite surprised that he actually showered me with non-sexual compliments and was very respectful of my limits. He was really into typical porn stuff such as face fucking and choking but he would ask before attempting anything and would stop and say sorry when I thought he was going too hard. Needless to say, I did see him again several times after that. "

I can't figure out if this attitude comes from a place of ignorance, or a ""women and their frivolous spending"" mindset, but it needs to stop. "
"Moscow. What a terrible place, everything overpriced, people are hostile, large capital city at its worst.


St. Petersburg on the other hand is amazing."
"I saw a vision of the future. 

I was nine or ten. We just ate supper and my mom would make my siblings and I help with the dishes. She would wash, we would dry and put them away. Anyways, there were three of us so we always ended up having to wait for another dish to be dried. I was leaning on the kitchen counter waiting, talking with my family. All of a sudden, it was like I blinked and I was watching something else in my head. Except it was me I was watching. It was a view from right behind me, and I could see myself crying in the kitchen, holding a pan. The whole thing was in brown tones, like a sepia filter was over the whole thing. And that was it. I didn’t know what it was but it only lasted like five seconds so I ignored it and kept talking to my family and doing dishes. A few minutes later, my brother went to put something away and crashed into me, and the pot he was holding landed on my toe. I knelt down and I was crying, and I realized it was the exact situation I’d just seen minutes before—me, kneeling in the kitchen, crying with a pan in my hands. 

It was so weird. I have no way to explain it and yet never happened again. "
"He was clearly using old, inaccurate, misleading pics and had also lied about several things in his profile. "
"Savage, you waited 10 years just to reverse a nasty comment.
I feel bad it stuck with you so long though."
"Not go out. 

Pool money and spend it on cheap wine and snacks and just chill at one of our houses. 

Edit: Unless you mean we all have to split $7, in which case my answer is the same but with cheaper wine. "
"Totally agree. It's funny that I've seen the same comment in /r/AskMen, clingy people of any gender are frustrating "
"I used to carry around a large spoon and flower seeds. The seeds were for flowers bees liked. I would randomly find a nice spot around town and plant the seeds. It was my way of helping the bees. It also made me feel like a fairy to leave flowers in my path.

Not exactly necessary though."

"All cheese has a place in my heart/house. It's common to find several different types in my fridge - from fancy imported hard cheeses, to locally produced soft cheeses that can only be purchased at the farmer's market, to regular grocery store block cheddar and processed cheese slices. The only type of cheese I get snobby about is low fat, because why bother? "

"As a Cambodian-American who has a Khmer visa with no expiration date, this is all very very true. It's one of the top three most corrupt countries in the world and you can't say anything bad about the current leadership. If you have the money, you could more or less do anything. It's a prime spot for pedophiles to find underage children and take advantage of them. It's fucked up. 

I've been there multiple times and despite the fact that I absolutely love that country and its people, it is incredibly depressing. I remember encountering a teen with special needs who came up to my family and I asking for money while huffing a bag of glue.

It's a beautiful country with amazing and honestly really sweet and hilarious (Cambodians have an amazing sense of humor imo) people, but definitely expect to see some depressing things. The poverty gap is so blatant, you could literally see a beautiful gated community nearby city hall and tin shacks directly across the street. The gentrification in Phnom Penh is really fucked up because the government is more or less seizing land from the poor because they don't have the documentation to claim it as theirs despite living there for so long. 

I'm sorry you had a depressing time, but I hope you enjoyed the culture, people, and especially the food! ❤️"
"When I was in 4th or 5th grade, my dad's girlfriend took me to a haunted cemetary (I was on a paranormal ghost kick). Anyways when I left, it was like these 2 spirits stayed with me. I vividly remember talking to these ghosts like alive people and actually learned all sorts of stuff about these 2 people...how they were married and the husband (Jason) died in war and his wife (angeline) worked as a maid and owned horses. No one would beleive me and my parents thought I had some sort of mental health problem and took me to get evaluated, but I was totally okay. I remember the last time I talked to them I told them that no one believed they were real and the had to go back to their graves. They wouldn't leave so I remember my dad's girlfriend driving me back up to the cemetary and I was bawling my eyes out the whole time.

 That was the end of it. Never had another experience like it. I'm not sure why it happened and looking back on it, it would have been totally alarming to my parents. But I swear to this day, I was talking to real spirits. "
"That monthly hormonal flucuations are normal and it's not ok to assume that whenever we're emotional or angry that it must just be the hormones.

Jamaica. My sister and I went and because we didn’t have a man with us we were incessantly graphically propositioned and harassed. And then some guy grabbed my wrist and tried to drag me into a van! I got away luckily but that was a horrible trip.
"She comes off as a badass but really she's the softest, most sensitive person I know. She's smart and funny and very intuitive. She's a real worrier and a bit of a pessimist. She's very caring and giving. She works incredibly hard, sometimes too hard. We dream big together."
"I have a thing that I say pretty often. 
When I get in arguments with people, I will not affirmatively state something that I don’t know to be true. Basically, if I’m speaking to some fact, I know it to be a fact. 
Guys don’t get this. So we’ll argue, he’ll go to google and finally realize I’m right. 
Usually, what I say is, “I know, I don’t say things unless I know I’m right about them.”

They call me conceited or roll their eyes at me but like.... Why would you ever put forth a fact as true if you weren’t sure? Do people just make it a habit to throw random shit out and hope they don’t get called on it? Like why am I the ridiculous one for only speaking when I’m sure about something? "
"Cleaning dishes when I'm done.  I was always bad about it.  Now, I can't tolerate dirty dishes. . "
i laughed out loud at this
"1) just because I didn't explicitly say no doesn't mean  you should keep trying. If I say I'm on my period and can't do anything, that's not an invitation to whip your dick out for a bj.

2) just because one girl was fine with what you did or said doesn't mean every girl will be that way.

3) it's not just what you say, it's also how you chose to say it."
"The good old ""she's mad, but she'll be happy when I send her an unsolicited picture of my penis!"""
"Too many people conflate “stop looking for love” and “stop dating.” It doesn’t mean stop asking people out/delete dating apps/etc, it means, stop expecting every date to possibly be your next wife/husband. Date and meet new people for the fun of it, and you’ll be more likely to find love than if you’re looking for it. "
"I am named after my maternal great grandmother, who died while my mum was pregnant with me. We have the same first + middle name, but different last names. When I was a little kid I had JUST learn to write my own name, (just my first name at that point), and I went off to playgroup. When my mum collected me, I had painted a picture and across the top had written my great grandmother's full name - ie. my first + middle names, plus her last name. My mum was really weirded out and asked me about it. Apparently I got really annoyed with her and kept saying, ""no, that's MY name.""

One time we also drove past my great grandmother's old house, and my dad was about to point out which house it was, and I just piped up and said ""They're not taking very good care of the garden, are they?"" 

I also named all my toys after people she knew - my great grandad was called Charlie and everyone's nickname for him was ""Fluff"". I named my two favourite toys Charlie and Fluff. 

Also everybody tells me I am a lot like my great grandma in personality and mannerisms. 

Anyway my mum is (to this day) convinced that I am my great grandma reincarnated, and it really freaked my parents out! I don't really believe it, but I definitely do feel some special connection to my great grandma, and I can understand why some people do believe in reincarnation. "
"When I was about 10 years old, I was sitting in the kitchen eating chicken noodle soup after school. My mom was turned towards the window, away from me washing dishes. 

My 10 year old self, out of nowhere says “Mom, grandma is here”. My mom is super confused and asks for me to clarify. 

I don’t know what happened exactly but I remember  this overwhelming feeling of happiness and warmth and everything good in the world washing over me. It felt like the best hug I could have ever gotten from someone. 

A few minutes later, we get a phone call from a relative in Poland informing my mom that my dear grandmother passed away a few minutes ago. Right then, our microwave turned on by itself. 

The microwave thing continued for a few months and the tv would turn on and off randomly. I know 100% that my dear grandmother came to say goodbye before she passed. 

I will never forget the feeling. "

"For me its a few things:
- if you have long hair please for the love of god WASH IT!!!!! Nothing ruins your look to me that greasy long hair.
- clothing that is clearly to big or too small for you. Its okay to wear a shirt that fits guys! Especially if you are trying to impress someone (boss, potential new boss, new love interest)
- wearing pjs out of the house, like if you are meeting up with someone or going shopping. This one goes for anyone really, if you can tell that they are pjs so can we. Sweat pants or those new athleisure pants are different to me.

Makeup
Cute with little kids. Weird and controlling when it's associated with the conservative guardianship-type cultures and virginity pledges. 
Wearing a bra. I absolutely hate bras.
"Alright. I totally replied and said skincare, but food is FOR SURE another big one. 

I generally eat “clean”, but sometimes it’s hard to shovel more chicken and broccoli down my throat. For some reason, food just tastes so much better when it is made by someone else. So, that said, Chipotle and my local pizza joint with bomb ass chicken salads are my go-to’s twice to three times a week. 

Sometimes I want to vomit when I add up how much I’ve spent on unnecessary takeout over the past two years. "

"Have you watched Great British Baking Show or Master Chef Jr? It’s like wholesome drama. 

Also kinda weird but my bf and I have started watching this show on Hulu called Forged in Fire - it’s like Chopped, but for making knives and swords. The criticism is sooo professional and not catty haha. "
"Fecal coliform and E.coli make yeast look like your best friend. Never, ever go from anal to vaginal without cleaning up."
"No. A few stories, from me and friends:

1. Me: went to doctor at age 17 because had severe pains in my joints, limped when I walked, and had a flu that hadn't gone away for 3 months. He diagnosed me with a sinus infection (WHAT). 5 months later, went to a female doctor. Was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. 

2. My best friend. Age 28, wanted to get her tubes tied. The doctor told her she was too young. Friend assured him that she really did not want children- she never had. She had had to abort a year before, despite being on the pill, and didn't want to go through that again. Doctor told her she needed to ""hold a baby"" and her mind would change. So instead, her boyfriend went to get a vasectomy. The doctor didn't object. 

3. Coworker. She felt severe pain all over, had major stomach problems, and was constantly exhausted. Doctor told her it was a mental issue and prescribed her with anti-psychotics. It took years before she was diagnosed with her actual condition- fibromyalgia and severe food allergies. 

There's studies on this- doctors tend not to take women's pain seriously, and especially women of colour. "
"Stop fucking waiting for life to happen to you. 

Study abroad. Pick up running now rather than nearly 10 years later...it's sucks, but it's also oddly enjoyable. Make the plans with friends instead of waiting for them to invite you to something. If they say no, do something cool alone.

Also, please don't be mean to grandma. It's not her fault that she's sick. Visit her, smile, and tell her you love her even when you aren't sure she's even lucid."
"I have this story about my ex (one of my favorites, which is all the sadder because we did not part well) about how I made us French onion soup once and his heinous, heinous onion farts woke me up from my sleep one night. 

I recently made that soup again and woke MYSELF up with MY own onion farts so now I realize they weren't his farts, they were mine all along! "
"I had got back with a college ex years after breaking up, and we were talking about old friends. I asked him how his friend Shawn was doing. He ended up saying, ""did you know Shawn thinks you're ugly? He said he couldn't believe I was having sex with you. But babe I told him you were like the hottest person I had ever had sex with!""

It wasn't anything specific about my appearance but the fact that Shawn said that and my (now ex) boyfriend felt the need to repeat that always stuck with me. 

Someone also came up to me in a Marshall's and said, ""your whole body is covered in tattoos? It's so gawdy.""

I have learned to accept that some people are just rude."
"On the bright side, those 10 minutes provided many of us with a source of entertainment! "
"San Fransisco. I was sexually assaulted, scammed by a tour company and generally had an awful time. I know it's not San Fran's fault but I never ever want to go there again. "
"&gt; so I’m not worried about an empty tank on the drive to work.

I was shocked to learn there are services that will *bring gas to you*! Where I work, there's a company that fills up your tank while your car is parked in your employer's parking lot. It's a few cents more per gallon than doing it yourself.

I've talked to the delivery people and it's a new company, so it could just be local (I'm in silicon valley). But if you're at the office a lot, it's worth looking for a similar business (or starting one!) in your area. 

Seriously, I'm so busy that it's saved me a lot of time. Ooh, I am so spoiled now. "
"That expression is for men, who assume they are still getting off, regardless."
"On the flip side, she took a poor comment made by a 9 year old who probably didn't know any better, stewed with it, and then used it on him at an age when she definitely DID know better. But who am I to say? That reminds me of people who got bullied in high school who have stories about their bullies applying for jobs with them 15 or 20 years later, stories in which the victim (in high school) bullies the other guy, except now they're nearly 40 and it's somehow more pathetic lol."
"My dad runs a food pantry/soup kitchen and he got ordained so that he could perform weddings for the chronically poor guests that usually couldn’t afford a typical wedding. 

One of these weddings took place in a 1950s themed hair salon where the bride worked. The bride wore her mother’s wedding dress and the groom wore blue jeans, a Guns N’ Roses tee and his finest leather vest. The guest list was small and most people sat in the salon chairs for the ceremony. After the newlyweds kissed we passed around a champagne toast to all of the guests and even the salon customers that attended because the salon was still open during the wedding. 

It was a very touching and truly bizarre experience."
"Well, I've never heard of it, but now I'm fucking terrified."
"I think that there is a subconscious association of height/ a big stature with authority, and shortness with ""cuteness"" or un-assertiveness. All my very short friends have noted that people assume that they are younger or 'softer' than they are, and that being taken seriously is different when you literally look up at everyone

I am taller than the average adult male, and I think that people defer to me more, I certainly don't feel as vulnerable walking around, and very few people can physically impose my space. I have a friend who is 5', and this has not been her experience at all"
"He gets real mad when I'm better at a video game than he is. Like it legit annoys him if I have a better KDA, or get better gear, or get MVP or something. It's only video games though. Really weird."
"I could not agree more, I’m sick of the whole “ you’re supposed to layer it” thing. Where I live ( the uk) not only are the t-shirts thin but most of them seem to be sleeveless or have cap sleeves. If you don’t like showing your upper arms or don’t want to have to shave your armpits every day you have to wear a cardigan. I don’t want to wear a cardigan when it’s hot."
"At my own wedding I didn't have a best man but I've had a best woman.
My best woman and I had gotten ready in her room ready for the big day, I had left my bag and such in the room as my future wife was getting ready in the marital suite.
To cut a long story short, my best woman had come up to me drunk and said something about one of the couple I had invited, I giggled and had paid no attention. 
Later on, I realise I haven't seen her in about an hour and I think that she's probably asleep and it's about time I get my bag and put it into my room. I slowly open the door and walk in to discover my best woman in between another lady's legs and her hubby across the room just enjoying himself. Safe to say I calmly got my bag, said hello and waved and just walked out.

I will never let her forget this."
"Makeup. I have everything from Wet n Wild to Dior. Also, wine. I have a friend that brought me a $200 bottle from his parents collection and I couldn’t tell the difference between that and my $8 bottle. "
"Actually had a guy come upstairs to my place, look around (i had just recently moved), handed me a 5 &amp; told me he figired i needed it. I told him to leave, i didnt need handouts. And i think he was wearing lipstick. "
"Yes. A whole heck of a lot. 


And then invalidate it like “well that just happened to you, there’s shitty people everywhere! It’s not always sexism!!”


I was told I wasn’t hired at one place bc I’m a woman Howard. How the fuck is that not discrimination? And every woman I know in my field has a similar story. 


But we all just have bad luck and run into assholes! Gender inequality is dead! "
"I would find it kinda cute and dorky, probably just go along with it"
"Oh god.... ""But you have those lovely child-birthin hips! They'll come cartwheeling out of there! I'm thinking of five or six... you cool with that? Oh and you can stay home with them, that's cool. I don't care if you get fat either because it's for a good cause."" 

(Friend of mine heard basically this from a guy. She just sat there going O_O). "
"I've told my husband I can deal with it better if he at least meets me halfway and cuddles with me, makes out, etc.  There's so much more to intimacy than just sex.  Find alternatives they you both can agree on."
"&gt; Choking is a lot more mainstream.

I will never understand what makes choking so attractive to people, because this is one of those things that I would never do, even if my partner wanted it.

That being said, it doesn't really help that a lot of women apparently like it. Just browse the sex subreddit. Doesn't mean men should just go for it and choke every single woman on this planet without asking them if they are into that, though."
"I'm actually incredible at interviews. It's like my anxiety becomes so severe that it shuts down my mental functioning to the point where I just literally don't care at all and say whatever pops into my head... which works out really well because I know all the stuff I need to know and am super over qualified, so once the nerves disappear I'm great.

It's weird how my anxiety does that, but it really does just get so severe that it shuts itself down(along with other important parts of my brain... oops). 
"
"Mine does this as well. I don’t feel bad telling him to get to the point because he’s an adult and I don’t always have the patience for it. I find that being open about my communication preferences leads to calmer marital conflicts...and he knows he tends to do that and doesn’t want to do that to people.

But when he’s stressed out, I’ll ask him a question about science and get him started. I’ll let him wind up and I’ll stop him and ask him to elaborate on the parts I don’t get. I’m not actually that interested in like, chemistry or whatever. It just perks him right up. He loves over explaining, so I do this small thing for him. "
"I don't agree with it. My parents had my ears pierced when I was a baby and didn't take care of the piercings. So they got infected and eventually they took the earrings out. Now my ears have lumps of scar tissue and I can't get them re-pierced. If my kid ever wants their ears pierced, I will wait until they can consent to it and can take care of the piercings."
"And then when you corner them with this, they act like it's a first world problem and we should be grateful we aren't as oppressed as women in the middle east, or just tell us the know women who enjoy it so our experience is invalid."
"I'm curious how old some of these commenters are. As a 40 year old woman, I've never had problems with men seemingly being influenced by porn moves. But is that because my age group didn't grow up with porn in their formative years?"
Do you clean the top of your car off after a snowstorm before driving on the highway??
"It may be worth looking into the research of Dr. Elaine Aron on HSPs (highly sensitive people in terms of sensory processing).

"Minimum of 8, 10 is a good night sleep on days off

Could easily sleep for like 12 hours if I've finished a night shift or am jetlagged lol

My bf thinks I sleep too much lol, I probably do tbh but in the other hand I just really like sleep"
That sounds like attempted rape to me. Drunk people can't consent.
Stomping his foot sounds like something a bratty two year old would do.  Jesus
"That we don’t get free shit all the time just because we’re women. Even if a cute guy does buy me a drink or two, I know it’s because he probably wants to have sex later. Nothing in life is free."
"Johannesburg. It's the only city where I've felt truly unsafe, and I experienced a lot of street harassment."
"Egypt. Went with my then boyf and the guys there wouldn't leave us slone. They kept yelling sexual things at me, and yelling at him with offer to buy me from him. If he took his eyes off me for more than a few seconds someone would grope me. I wasn't even dressed provocatively, I wore long loose khaftans, big cotton neckscarves, and trousers because I burn easily, so I was totally covered up in baggy clothes. I spent several times on that trip bawling my eyes out in the hotel room and having various nightmares about it."
"10 things I hate about you would be high up there, I watched it endlessly as a teen"
"measure your food. You think you're good at eyeballing; you're not. get a scale.

Also, learn what kind a person you are, and what kind of lifestyle change will be best. Like, I'm not a person who can deal with restrictions on the type of food I can eat. So paleo, keto, atkins, whatever won't work for me. That's okay. I just eat what I want as long as it fits my calories. Some people need the structure and a list of foods they're allowed. That's cool too. But I think a lot of people who don't succeed are trying to force themselves into a lifestyle that just isn't sustainable for them. "
"If there's chemistry and we've been flirting, it'd be cute. If I hadn't given any signs of wanting to get closer then it'd make me feel really uncomfortable. "
"When I was a kid, I went to a local pond for a friend's birthday party. The part we were on was public and then you could kinda pick your way along the shore through growth that went straight to the edges to get around to other properties which were private.   

It was dark but it was summer time so it felt...idk fine to be out at that time of day? Especially in our neighborhood public pond. A friend and I started talking to some guys probably on vacation at a nearby property. They kept telling us to come over. So we decided, fuck it, we'll be right back and we started picking our way through the woods along the pond. It was pretty dark inside the dense trees and we couldnt see all that well.   

Suddenly, I started to hear undergrowth crackling under foot *ahead* of us as if someone else was there between properties too. I called out a ""who's there?"" And no one responded. I could see the silhouette of someone a little ways down the deer trail so I called out again ""hello...?"" And still no response but the sounds continued as the figure moved closer. Suddenly, with no warning, a brilliant flashlight turned on instantly blinding in the dark. It stayed on for a second or two, my increasingly anxious ""hellos"" and ""who's there's"" continue to get no response. then the light clicked off and all I could see was blackness and the green after image from the light. And then the crackling continued as the figure moved forward again, faster now because it knows we can't see.   

I spun, grabbed my friend, and bolted back the way we'd come. Luckily, we weren't that far deep. And very probably this was just a shitty prank those guys played on anyone they could convince to come through the woods after dark. Still though. Scared the fuck out of me at the time."
"Outlander series. The storyline has been dragged on for way too long, the plot has more holes than Swiss cheese, absolutely nothing is realistic about the plot, the author and even the TV show costume designer kept having social media meltdowns, and as a historical costumer don’t even get me started on the costumes...I kept reading it and watching the show. "
"I do this just because I hope one day they will wave back, just once. And if it happens I feel like I absolutely must not tell anyone it happened."
