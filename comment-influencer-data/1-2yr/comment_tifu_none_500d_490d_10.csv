500 words and you had to plagiarize. This reddit post is like 160 words...1/3 of what you would have to do.
This is one time where I'd be okay with this being a repost.
"If you need some positive words of encouragement, you can search Wikipedia for them because they're definitely not in these comments."
"All right, either this:

A) Didn't happen. Speaking from the other end, it's highly unlikely I would recommend expelling a student over plagiarizing a 500 word essay. Might make him sweat a bit, but taking such an extreme action is frankly not worth the paperwork. Or...

B) This happened, and there's way more to this story than you're letting on. Like you've barely shown up to the class, blown off other assignments, been rude and disrespectful to the instructor, etc. You'd have to have seriously pissed off this person to drive her to what essentially is the nuclear option."
"Unfortunately, you have skill and paint quite a picture with your words. I've gone a bit weak."
"Do NOT download anything.  It will overwrite the ""deleted"" data.  Get a computer program to help you recover the photos or call an expert."
Dude could have just gotten stoned and rambled and he'd probably be in better shape. 
"Love the story. You didn’t re-address the fact that the door was unlocked and slightly ajar. Are you implying that the ants did this too? If so, this is all more horrifying than I previously imagined. "
Your last essay was a 500 word one? Why am I not believing this?
"Doesn't the bottle say: *do not apply to any metaphors*

?"
"Keep going my dude. Eventually you'll lower the bar enough that I'll seem relatively normal by comparison

*eats skin flakes*"
"You can use as many as you want for strength, and only the top one gets dirty.  The rest can go back."
"After 4 years of engineering, you should be able to shit out a 500 word essay while running. "
Why... have you not... gone to a doctor to remove it... 
"FWIW, OP has a few questionable risk/reward decisions under his belt... Including a LPT on how to defraud the credit card company, and a story about making $1000 at a festival selling people pieces of paper by telling them it's acid. (He only needs to do this 99 more times to pay back his school debt!) /s

I have have made past decisions that seemed insignificant at the time, but later blew up in my face and caused long term setbacks. It sucks, but understanding potential implications of your choices is one of the most important things you'll learn in life. OP, your only hope for appeal is to be humble and contrite. Don't try and minimize the infraction, and pray they have compassion. and MAKE BETTER CHOICES.

Edit: I didn't realize the credit card post was backed by a red mallard, so it was meant to be bad advice. Whoops."
I love that you use a different name for your tool shed each time
Im going with bull shit. An engeneering student weeks away from graduating is not going to plagarize a 500 word essay he could have taken a zero on. 
I will expel them from Reddit for plagiarism.
"That's some bad risk/ reward thinking there. A passing grade didn't rely on this short paper, yet you decided to copy-paste that sumbitch. Hell, you coulda just printed the last one you wrote, turned it in, and said ""whoops, my bad, was in the same folder and I didn't even notice, here's the right one.""  You just can't pass off someone else's work as your own. "
"&gt; I went to a music festival with 100 little squares of paper and sold each for $10 telling people it was acid. Thats $1000 and all I did was change my shirt so people wouldnt recognize me. 

  
Seriously. What a piece of shit this person is."
He could have told the teacher to go fuck herself a couple hundred times and he'd be in better shape.
"There once was a man who drank lots of tea 
He drove a big van, in jugs he would pee
Till one day in his haste, drank bodily waste
Now he probably needs therapy"
Or just put a paper plate on top of a real plate and it's actually sturdy 
If it was an actual accident it’s fine and was a honest mistake you shouldn’t feel bad.
"A stroke of bad luck, thats all it was"

Do you want ants? Cause that's how you get ants.

"Second this. Don't do it yourself, you might just fuck it up and remove everything forever!

Edit: maybe you can't according to some people here, idk, can't hurt to ask an expert though. "
Plate condoms.
I like reading your past posts and savoring the image of  you living your life with no idea of your impending doom.
"I have good news, and I have bad news.

Odds are that the ants did not come in because the door was open.  The power brick had a hell of a lot of ant eggs in it, and they hatched in the nice warm, dry basement cave.  

The good news is that this won't happen just because you leave the door open.

The bad news is that there may be another set of ant eggs in there that will hatch in the future.  So you should take that brick apart, and the Xbox as well.

"Cover the entire cab of the truck with a 1.1 mix of coffee grounds and baking soda, like the whole thing, every nook and cranny and every vent.

Leave it for a week, then vacuum out the mixture and power wash the truck again. After that take it to be detailed.

Then set the whole thing on fire with thermite and roll it into a quarry."
"Lol he posted that? What a scummy pile of shit. So he didn't just ""make a mistake"" by partying and plagiarizing. He is just a guy who scams his way through life. 

I really hope this story is true and this guy really did get expelled, he is not fit to be an engineer. "
I was also waiting to see how this was resolved. 
"**Take the alcohol soaked gauge out!** It is not suppose to be lodged there, it will kill pretty much everything that is trying to grow there to  protect the wound, it will dry out, replace water, wash away oils, fluids in the cellular matrix that carry all kinds of neat little things that are meant to aid in the repair, quite literally first aid. Only a LIGHT wipe with alcohol followed by water. Really, no alcohol on wounds! It will take longer to heal, it is NOT SUPPOSE TO STING for long periods of time. Use water, we live in a society that has abundance of clean, running water which is already very potent solvent, in fact one of the strongest solvent we have; we quite literally divide all things to be either water soluble or not.. It is safest. I cut myself quite often, i like doing things with my hands and am not the real Uncle Bumblefuck so i've had to learn how to treat small wounds. 

Quick wipe with isopropyl alcohol to clean the **unbroken skin around the wound**, then lots and lots of water in the wound. A paper nick requires a half a minute under water. No other liquid but clean water should touch the wound. You can use very small amounts of soap, it is by far safer but can't overstate the importance of pure, clean water used as a solvent instead of alcohol. Then keep covered with dry, fresh gauge and let your body do the rest. If it starts to get red, hot and general inflammation, go to a doctor (if you can afford; go anyway, we would all feel a lot better if a doctor or even a nurse looked at it.)"
"Not to one-up you, but it's too good not to mention. One loose bolt on a peterbilt cost my company $13,000 earlier this year. It was a fuel injector hold-down. It caused the computer to limit the truck to 5mph and took the shop a week to figure out because the diagnostic code wasn't specific.

Edit: the bolt for the hold down was loose, causing the injector to not sit snugly in its hole on the cylinder head, allowing air and fuel in places it doesn't belong. Sorry I wasn't clear! "

"Ask your partner what she's into. Seriously! Start an open dialog. Pour some wine and after a couple glasses just ask her 'hey, what do you wish we did more of in bed? Like what are your turn ons and fetishes?'

An open dialog is incredibly inmportant. It's like a flashlight in the dark. "
I call bullshit because of OPs dubious post history. 
"I'm sorry if this comes off as harsh, but you truly did bring this on yourself. This may be salvageable if you work your appeal right, but you made an incredibly poor choice, especially with low/zero tolerance plagiarism policies and on an incredibly short assignment."

"I was going to say he could have just not done it, but yours works better. "
"I don’t believe this story for a second. It’s probably less effort to write 500 words and then to change up a wiki paragraph, one. Two, I don’t see a dean expelling a senior in late Spring over a 500 weird essay, unless this was like strike three. Also, that would be one hell of a power trip. “ I know you just spent $100,000 in education and you’re about to be done but you’re expelled now over a 500 word essay.” Not a chance."
"I bet that every parent is clicking on this link thinking ""ok, let's see what happened with poop"".

"I used to do people's homework for money. I put flyers up around the freshman dorms at the college near where I live and I got more work than I can handle. You would not believe how dumb people are these days. I don't know if it's Instagram or what but some of these students are some retarded ass motherfuckers. They don't want to read and they are literally incapable of writing a coherent sentence. I'd say ~1/4th of the work I accepted took me less than ten minutes. I charged $30 minimum so I was making six figures a year under the table. I had kids calling me up begging me to read a single paragraph and summarize it. How the fuck do you summarize a single paragraph? One sentence? One word? If someone's willing to pay $30 a page for a single sentence because they're too lazy to read and comprehend a single paragraph, they don't even deserve to be in college. Sorry not sorry. One story you're not going to believe. Kid texted me a picture of a drive-thru menu. ""wut cn i get 4 6$"" Yeah, I said you weren't going to believe it. I could hardly believe it myself. Was he too dumb or too lazy? I don't know which one is worse. Of course I told him to fuck off because like I said I have a $30 minimum and this guy obviously was not rolling bills. He was a business major. I loved the business majors. They were a huge part of my business. They sent me these 20-page reports that they have to summarize and I charged them for each page I had to read. Usually it's pretty interesting stuff. Ever heard of the Cereal Wars of 1994? That was the year private label (aka generic) cereal took over a large portion of the industry. Kelloggs and GM and some other brand that I can't remember (""The Big 3"") started getting nervous since they'd been doing this tactic called ""Price Up and Spend Back"" for like 20 years, pumping prices and spending lots on marketing coupons, but along comes generic selling for 40% less than the competition and boom, PLs take like 10% of the market, the Big 3's suddenly started to sweat, they can't compete in a price war with private labels; private labels save on marketing and packaging, and also they use cheaper materials, too, so the Big 3's ""Price Up and Spend Back"" is basically them paying to print coupons that customers have to find and use (annoying) just to come anywhere near private label prices. So for the first time in decades GM decides to abandon ""Price Up and Spend Back"" while Kelloggs decides to stay the course, setting the stage for an epic showdown of two cereal titans, all instigated by the lowly and disruptive private label... This shit was 17 pages, including six pages of graphs and charts and shit! I know more about the cereal industry 25 years ago than anyone would ever need to know! Why the fuck don't these business schools use more modern examples? The professor was asking us to write a paper like we were living in the 90s! ""Who do you think will win the coming price war, GM or Kelloggs?"" What, am I supposed to act like Google isn't a thing? It happened two decades ago, we already know who's gonna fucking win! Goddamn, our system of education is retarded!

Edit: okay guys I gotta come clean, too many sleuths up in here for me to maintain a good deception... I actually made seven figures a year sry for lyin"

"I wrote like 2 essays in 5 years of engineering and they were both for a first year english class.

I mean it's still not very hard, but essays aren't really a thing in engineering, in my experience we were more about projects and problem solving type questions.

"ER doc here. No way. The ear canal is very small, and even the smallest ""Googly eye"" would be blocking ear wax and fluids if it were lodged there for several years. You would likely have diminished hearing in the that ear, maybe even pain and pressure due to wax build up. 

If you have not been to the doctor's for several years (no vaccinations for school, camp, or sports?), you probably need to go, Googly eye in the ear or not."

"Some ant species are sorta attracted to electricity; it starts when one ant happens to stumble into an exposed contact, as it is being eletrocuted, it releases pheromones telling other ants there is a threat to the colony, then as more ants come and get zapped attacking the source of electricity the effect gets stronger. I lost a phone charging cable like that back in my teens, it started with just a little nick in the rubber of the cable, but after while the hole grew as the ants attacked the plastic/rubber around the exposed wire, exposing the wire even more and increasing the odds more ants would get ""attacked""."

"Hey OP! Phone repair person here, I also do a lot of data recoveries.

Do. Not. Use. The. Phone. 

If you have a *reputable* phone repair shop I would call them and ask if they can do data recoveries on Android devices. 

If you don’t have then there are two options: sending your phone into another shop or doing it yourself. My shop that I work at does plenty of data recoveries from deleted data so there is a good chance that it could be recovered through them. You can shoot me a PM if you’d like. I’ll help get the price and everything for you

If you’re going to do it yourself you need to download a file manager app that can see deleted files. (EaseUS is a good tool) and pull all of the pictures and such off onto your own computer.

I'm assuming one of two things here:  this is some kind of weird writing AI that pieces together cobbled paragraph stories from pieces of information in posts and other places.  Or, you're just bullshitting every single post farming karma / gold.

Either way, such an achievement (/s)"

"I agree. Whilst I think this is a valuable learning experience (and makes for a great cautionary tale as well about why plaigerizing is a bad idea) I also feel like this is over the top. Its 500 words. Potentially killing someone's 4 years of work like that over 500 words feels a bit absurd.

Although, on the other hand, he is a senior at a University. I would imagine a senior in any field would able to hammer out a 500 word essay like its second nature by that point."
I am a prof. Had a grad student plagiarize a previous student’s introduction section on a final paper. Turnitin flagged it. Student was all set to graduate that semester after a 60 credit hour master’s program with a few hundred hour unpaid internship. Best/worst part? Introduction section was not on my outline for the assignment. I gave them several questions to answer in-depth (case review style) but did not ask them to include an intro; she copied an overachiever from the previous year. The rest of the paper - what I actually wanted her to write - was *not* plagiarized.  I ended up making her write an extra paper on ethics. Did not have the heart to fail her but man was I pissed. 
The real TIFU was by the girls father. What kind of man would leave a 16 year old kid alone in a parking garage at night. Even if he couldn't jump start the car he should have stayed and made sure AAA showed up and got you started.

"This reminds me of the time I had a door that needed replaced because it wasn't sitting right in the frame. Anyway, the gap wasn't visible, but it was enough for insects to crawl in. By the tens. Stink bugs everywhere. I'm screaming and my mom is smashing bugs while I'm standing on a stool, trying to tape the door shut. The tape worked. If anyone tried to take it off, I screamed. At least stink bugs can't bite you, though. "
"&gt; 5-10 page lab reports

More like 10-20... what a waste of paper."
"Yeah, could've easily saved it by ""Oh, I don't, I was just making a movie reference to the Dutch character in the Austin Powers movies, have you seen it?"" and move on from there. If OP had any kind of social skills, he could've easily turned that around. If he just let it hang there with a poor explanation, it's on him."
"Sounds like shitty diagnostic software to me, or the software wasn't specifically designed for diagnostic purposes.

At work we get to deal with ambiguous fault codes that can take a while to figure out, mostly due to the software being purposed for equipment usability and not fault code troubleshooting."
"Usually expulsion is done for repeated plagiarism or something particularly egregious. It's entirely possible that OP either has been caught before or has had the benefit of the doubt in several occasions, which put him on very thin ice to begin with.

It could be a pretty strict institution, though."
"So there was this

&gt;fished the poop out with a **cup**

and there are 2 girls in the story

and there was poop.

This sounds disgustingly familiar to me...."
"Seriously, a final essay in a class is one either going to be way more than 500 words or is a freebie A from the proff.  "
"in the 90s before things got as strict as it is now, i was a teen on a trip with my family and had a pack of gum in my coat. it triggered metal detectors and they asked me if i had anything metal in my pocket, i said “oh, i think it’s my gum”.

they heard “gun”.

there was a second of panic trying to correct what they heard and then it was fine, i imagine today it would have been much worse."
Everyone is a bot except you.
"The overflow valve in the toilet stops working like it should and the toilet keeps filling and filling. Had it happen in house I rented. Long day at work, got home late and i just hear dripping when I walk in. Turn on the lights and find out water has been leaking from the second floor toilet down to the kitchen. Emergency call to the landlord. "
"A few have said it, but these phones are automatically set up to backup 95% of the time, unless you tell it specifically NOT to. 

Gmail (which you have to have on android) backs up contacts automatically, and pictures NORMALLY.  First time you open Google Photos it asks if you want to. 

Otherwise, not all hope is lost. There are ways to get the stuff back most of the time. Data Savers is a great company. The more they save the most it costs, but for some it’s worth the money. "
"when i worked at a gas station there was a regular who bought 4 cans every morning at 6am, and yes they were all for him"
Pull shit like this at work as an engineer and people die. The most important qualification for his degree is ethics.
"Bahrain is a fucking shithole and I saw several women get publicly beat by their husbands so you can take that and go fuck yourself with it. 

And the US Military is not imposing, it literally has a deal with the Bahraini government to be there amiably. The only problem is the people have no right to effect change one way or another or they'll be murdered (Arab Spring).

The Americans (and British, Euro Forces, Other Middle Eastern Forces all stationed there btw) are to blame? Give me a fucking break. 
"
My brother used to dip all the time. He used the same bottle every single day and wrapped it in duct tape to ensure nobody accidentally drank from it. People still managed to drink out if it. 
"So much this! Or better yet, please seek medical attention. I promise you they see weirder/more embarrassing injuries on a weekly if not daily basis.

At the very least, get that alcohol away from the wound, clean with water and then repack with fresh gauze, changing dressings immediately if they bleed through.

Anal injuries can be dangerous as there is a high risk of fecal contamination leading to infection and potentionally blood poisoning also. "
"The ants side of the story:

Tifu by invading an XBox power brick and getting my entire family killed."
"Reminds me of a story.  Husband and I went to a triple-A league baseball game for the first time.  We got our lunch from the concession stand, which for me included a hot dog and a plate of nachos.  I started eating when they asked us to rise for the national anthem.

Now, there are no good places for you to put down your food at a baseball stadium.  You can't even turn around behind you and put it down in your seat because the seats fold up when they're not being sat on.  So, I stand up, place my hot dog on top of my nachos so I can hold all of my food in one hand, and like a good little American, I remove my baseball cap with the other hand.

As the anthem goes on I realize that my nachos are not a flat surface.  My hot dog slowly begins to roll off the side of the plate.  Everything goes into slow motion.  I panic and reach out to grab the hot dog as it crawls off the edge, but I have no free hands.  I catch it... in my hat.  

The inside of the hat of course is now covered in condiments.  I couldn't keep my composure.  I just start silently laughing my ass off during the last part of the anthem, holding nachos in one hand and a hat containing a hot dog in the other.  My husband looks over to see what the fuss is about and calmly takes a picture of the hot dog in my hat, then goes back to standing at attention.

"Ya, he's just a piece of shit who thinks he can glide by in life scamming people. I hope this story is true so he gets what he deserves"
"Go to the hospital. That alcohol pad will do more harm than good, and a wound like that needs to be treated by a professional. Otherwise, you risk getting a brutal ass infection, inadvertently opening and widening the wound, causing you to bleed dangerously high amounts, or the tissue not healing properly and having your shits be nightmarish for the rest of your life."
"""No no no, it's *chewing* gum""

""He's got a shooting gun!"""
"Update: Was up until 7:30 AM. Did about 90% of my work. By the grace of God my professor started grading them at 3:30 for about 45 minutes. He was giving me 70/100 on all my assignments. I still missed a few but I think I am good. But after I finished I went to catch some shut eye before work, Carpool left at 10:15, work up by my roommate at 10:25. Made it to work with a minute to spar, currently trying to stay awake"
