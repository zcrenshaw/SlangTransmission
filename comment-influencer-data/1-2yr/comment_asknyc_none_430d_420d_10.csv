"The Hampton’s is the end of Long Island. 

People will use Hamptons to talk about a bunch of little towns out there that are close together - Bridgehampton, East Hampton, Amagansett, Montauk, etc. All those places. 

The Hampton’s are now a rich New Yorker’s summer escape / status symbol. You have to be making loads of money to have a nice house out there. And an ungodly amount of money for a spot that’s a close walk to a beach. 

There are loads of locals out there who I’m sure despise the NYC people flocking out there every summer. But that’s what it is - play time for the rich people of the city. 

There are loads of nice beaches, sceney bars and clubs and restaurants. Massive estates. Golf courses, vineyards. People in Ferraris and Teslas. Meals and drinks are so much money that most New Yorkers would be spending their entire week’s wages on a night out there. 

You may have heard of Warriors starting lineup embarrassingly referred to as the “Hampton 5,” as that’s where they recruited Kevin Durant. Loads of celebrities love to spend time out there - Lorne Michaels, Jerry Seinfeld, etc. And loads of wannabe celebs as well. 

There are massive parties and get togethers. Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends, super rich kids with nothing but loose ends as Frank Ocean might put it throwing absolute bangers with their teenager comrades. 

Someone my brother knew threw a sweet 16 when he was in high school, and he got an invite somehow. He said David Blaine was there doing tricks, and that Usher performed. 

Throughout my life I used to go up to a hotel in Montauk called the East Deck. I loved that place to death. It wasn’t gaudy and flashy like everything else out there. And now? It was bought for $22 million and knocked to ashes, and the land isn’t currently being used. 

Despite what the Hampton’s are now, there’s still a feeling of authenticity, and a feeling of comfort to some of the towns and spots. There’s that elusive, laid back surfer vibe. It’s just nice. It’s nice to be out there. The air feels nice, the breeze from the ocean feels amazing, the smell of fire. Being able to look up as see FUCKING STARS. Grass and trees. Farms and plants. Nature and animals in general. These are things that New Yorkers don’t get to experience. 

Open spaces as opposed to dirt and grime, massive buildings sweat and stench. The ability to let your guard down and unwind. 

The real problem with the Hamptons, where the stigma comes from, is the people. They’re mean, selfish, entitled, entitled, and entitled. Sooo concerned with their appearances, and who they see. Soooo disrespectful to people who don’t have the money and privilege that they do. And dare I say, occasionally racist. The affluence means it’s overwhelmingly white. I mean, if the sun weren’t out on those beaches, you’d still need 50 SPF just from the rays reflecting off people’s bodies. 

I don’t know if that’s helpful at all. But I would say this; It’s *kind of* horrible, but also *totally* wonderful. And even though I have issues with the place, I wish I could afford a place out there, and so do you. "

They make themselves feel better by picking on people who moved to the city more recently than they did. 
"Tough crowd today, huh? 

Sorry you had to put up with the workers harassment, no wants to deal with that shit. Sounds scary being surrounded and followed like that."
Uh...you didn’t realize there was no sink before signing a lease?
"Lol mind your business?   
Yeah fuck OP for trying to make this city better"
"tourists love this shit. and unfortunately, the only way to stop this from happening is for people to stop giving to these guys.

Yeah everyone here seems to be missing the point that someone was followed and harassed by on duty city employees. Nothing that transpired beforehand makes that okay.
"Doorman fucked up, big time."
I'm still at my parents house. Just turned 27. Most of my friends in the same age range make good money (80-110K) and choose to live at home. We are all savers. The city is just so fucking expensive. The student loans is the major thing holding me back (that and also housing prices lol). I think of moving out but I would rather pay my dad a little rent and have my money go towards him instead of paying someone else. I am working on a business on the side so my goal is to buy my parents a house when that takes off. I would rather save and invest that extra 1K-2K a month in expenses to save for a nice house.

"Clean for move-in generally means ""broom clean"" - debris removed and closets swept out. If they are promising professional cleaning, get it in writing as a rider to the lease. However, they will probably require you to provide the same standard on move-out.

I've generally experienced that painting is done as promised.  Usually by two drunk monkeys who just throw buckets of paint at the walls, but it is done. (for real, in one apartment they painted over the breakers - not the breaker box, the breakers. In another paint was applied so thickly to the closet doors/doorframes, they couldn't be closed and we had to strip the edges of the doors ourselves to have closet doors that close.)"

"Seamless is a mobile food ordering app, and as long as you have her address you could have meals sent to her place if she ever mentions being hungry or gets home from work late. There are also dessert places (like Insomnia Cookies and ice cream places) so if she has a sweet tooth you could send sweet treats too. You pay in advance through the app, including the tip, so all she would have to do is open the door (might want to warn her that someone is coming so she isn't spooked). If her building has rules about how to get in (buzzer system, doorman, etc.) make sure you know that so you can put it in the delivery notes section."
"Mailmen have keys.  There is usually a little USPS box with a key to the building near the front door that they open.

FedEx/UPS will literally just randomly buzz every apartment in the building to get in.  They don't have keys."

"&gt;  just keep my distance

if they start dancing right in front of you, you definitely need to be very aware of distance at all times. those guys are usually pretty athletic and weirdly able to avoid collisions in such close quarters, but still...accidents happen...and it's best to be on the defensive if they are right in front of you."
"Sorry you had to experience this. Your description of this person is very similar to the person I encountered (very tan skin, possibly of South Asian descent, and did not seem homeless, but not very well kept either). 

Did he carry a gym duffel bag by any chance by Nike or Adidas? The person that I encountered decided to sit across from me on an entirely empty train, and stared directly at me for the majority of my train ride until I gave him a stern look. He then moved to the end of the car. He stood there until I got off he train, but, he got off as well... thankfully he didn’t follow me, but that was a weird experience."
"Alright y'all, I'll set ya straight about ""The Hamptons"".

Preface: I'm not rich. Again, I'm not rich. And by ""The Hamptons"", I'm referring to the area from Southampton to Montauk.

I live in East Hampton year round. It's an incredibly strange place to live, as the contrast between the hyper-rich and poor is staggering. I'm 17 years old and attend high school out here, but I perform as a full-time musician during the summer and gig during weekends during the ""off season"" (roughly labor day-memorial day). I see a lot of different types of people, and I'm exposed pretty regularly to people with outlandish lifestyles, as I play a lot of parties and clubs.

The Good: The public beaches are outstanding here. The nightlife is pretty good, and the restaurants and bars are pretty top notch, and a lot of outposts from NYC restaurants are out here as well (EMP, Serafina, etc.). There are a lot of things to do, if you can afford it. It's easy to get to. On most weekdays it's a 2.5 car ride, but you can also take the LIRR or a nearly nonstop bus. You can also take a helicopter, because why the fuck not?

However, it's not inherently special. There are tons of destinations within a 2.5 hour drive of Manhattan that easily compare, without any of the drawbacks. The reason people come to the Hamptons, like another commenter said, is status.

It's just cool to have a house ""in the Hamptons"". It means you're a cut above the rest, a little bit more special because you can afford the real estate, and go to the same beaches as Jerry Seinfeld or Miley Cyrus. There is a whole social scene attached to it, and if you want to stay relevant within your Upper East Side social circle, you better summer in the Hamptons. 

People who come out here are typically, in my opinion, the worst NYC has to offer. Billionaires, celebrities, the lot. We get the UES Old Money types, Murray Hill bros, downtown trust fund babies, and anyone else you can think of who values their reputation first and foremost. They come here, acting like they run the town in their god-awful G-Wagons, act entitled and rude to everyone they encounter, and are generally insufferable. Now, that's obviously a generalization and I do rely on their patronage to make money and save for college, but it doesn't excuse the shitty careless behavior. 

There is a lot of shit that flies under the radar. Not naming any businesses in particular, but I've heard rumors repeatedly about certain bar/hotel establishments that prostitute out staff. I know of businesses that are fronts for drug dealing and other sorts of shady activity. Anything can be bought. Teenage drinking and drug use is OFF THE CHARTS. Rich kids indulging in debauchery 24/7. Most locals don't ever directly come into contact with this behavior, unless they are willing to play the game and fake their way into vapid social scenes. It's one of the poorest communities on LI, and gentrification has WRECKED any sense of affordable housing. Many of us scrape to get by. It's can be fucking TOUGH out here.

It's a nice getaway from the city, and if you're willing to ignore the stigmas and issues surrounding this place, it can be a great thing to experience. There is a lot of natural beauty, but the reputation survives on the fact that ""The Hamptons"" is a status symbol more than a perfect getaway. It's incredibly nice, don't get me wrong, but it's built for a certain kind of person. I'm getting right the fuck up out of here for Queens, Harlem, or Brooklyn ASAP, but I can't say I won't be back occasionally, because the work for a musician can be pretty great."
When you stop caring about it. 
"**AN UPDATE FOR THOSE INTERESTED:**

Thank you so much to everyone for your advice and suggestions, especially those that PM'd me vet recommendations or offers to foster. After a very long and confusing afternoon, I finally got in touch with my roommate and the short version of it is: we now own a cat! (or the cat owns us, I don't think I'll ever be out of the mindset that this is the Cat's Apartment after the power movie it pulled today). 

I gave him (didn't know it was a him until about an hour ago) water and food, and made a litter pan out of the materials suggested by others here. After a few hours, my roommate resurfaced (the one who'd been dog sitting in BK) and told me that the mother of the family she was dog-sitting for had recently passed, leaving behind a cat that the family didn't really want and that DID NOT get along with the dog. 

With the family's permission, she brought to cat to our place in a carrier, but as the family was unprepared for the cat's arrival at the start of this week (in general and because they were in mourning) they sadly had no supplies or toys for the little guy. When she got him into our place, he had a strange insistence on pawing at my door and trying to get into my room. (I have lavender aromatherapy oils in here, not sure if that could be a factor?)

Being stressed out and in need to go to the store and upset that nobody was home, she ended up making the split decision to leave the cat to its own devices in my room where he wanted to go and closing him in there to keep him from getting lost in the unfamiliar environment of the rest of the apartment - kind of a dick move since she didn't tell me about it, but understandable when she told the story. 

She didn't want to ask about the possibility of adopting a pet via text and had been trying to wait until at least one of us was home, but she needed to go supply shopping and the two of us managed to miss each other. No idea why she wasn't answering her phone, but she's...kind of flaky in general. Obviously she ended up taking longer than expected getting supplies, and still needed to haul herself back to BK to feed the family's dog. Time management ain't her thing.

TLDR; roommate brought the cat into the apartment and left him in my room during a stressed out moment, we're keeping him.

**IF ANYONE HAS NAME SUGGESTIONS, we're an apartment full of theatre and harry potter nerds looking for ideas.**"

"Easiest solution is to automate the whole process:  
  
1. Create a free checking account at Ally Bank (or another online bank)
2. Fund the account with rent money on or just before the 1st of the month, either by splitting your direct deposit from work or scheduling a monthly transfer from your main account
3. Schedule an Ally bill pay check to be delivered to your landlord on the 1st of each month . 
  
Now it doesn't matter if your LL cashes on the 1st, 15th, or 45th day. Everything is separate from your main account, and you don't have to think about it."

"Everybody here is hanging by a thread. You're in good company. New Yorkers are tough because we're always a little on edge and we all know everything can change in an instant. I was terrified and excited simultaneously and I don't think that's at all unique.

NYC has a way of making even the most special and talented people feel small and it keeps our edge sharp. If you're on your way here for work then you did something right, and not everyone can say that. Be strong, keep learning, and know you're in the same damn boat as everybody else in this hell hole.

Edit: I think my thought is a bit misconstrued and I clarified it in another comment. I don't mean to say everybody is literally a basket case, walking around a little afraid. I'm not afraid (I've got shit to do!). I mean it more figuratively: Everybody here accepts some chaos and we just have to move on our lives. Some people express it more than others, but it's all kind of there for each of us in one way or another. ""Good company.""

"Italian Americans account for 8.5% of NYC's population, about 685,000 people! Plenty of pizzerias have Italian American workers, not uncommon...depends what neighborhood you are in. Most Italian Americans at this point are second or third generation Italians and most do not speak Italian. Their parents or more likely grandparents/great-grandparents may speak Italian, but many immigrated from poor rural areas in southern Italy and primarily spoke various dialects that could differ greatly from standard Italian.
