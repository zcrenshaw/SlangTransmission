"Father of an 11 year old girl checking in. 

Some time ago there was a thread about women and their relationships with their dads. ""What do you wish he knew or did more"" something along those lines. The takeaway I got from that was time spent together was the most important thing followed closely by just getting to know their daughters as people. The thread gave me a lot to think about.

"Forearms.

Whenever I wear a sweater I remember to roll up those sleeves."
"Asking is a good thing but there's a right time, like not on the first date for coffee."
How much of a slob you are when they're not around. They can assume... But they'll never know the true extent. 
"One of my guy friends refused to go and buy tampons or pads for his girlfriend because and I quote, “People will think they’re mine.” 

YES, BECAUSE MEN HAVE PERIODS NOW APPARENTLY."
"Something that doesn't really involve them. Say your friend confides in you a secret or whatever. That stays between you and the friend, and isn't something you would share with your SO. "
"-	Driving to work with the my music on.

-	That first sip of coffee in the morning.

-	A shower or bath after going to the gym.

-	Seeing a cute dog walking outside in the neighborhood. 

-	Steaming or ironing my wrinkled clothing. 

-	Redditing during live events. I loved talking to people on popheads during the Grammy's. Same with the finale of the Bachelor on that subreddit. People are so snarky, I love it. 

-	Finding a clothing item at TJ Maxx/Marshall's/thrift store that fits perfectly. 

-	Wearing new underwear or matching pair of patterned socks.

-	Lighting a new candle.

-	Getting skip the dishes after a long day at work. 

-	Picking out books at the library to read. 

-	Receiving mail. I love getting things in the mail. 

-	Having a bonding moment with one of my students at school after a rough week with them. 

-	Picking out a card for someone. I love cards. 

- Hot gluing things. I love doing art stuff for work (bulletin boards, name tags) and using a glue gun mindlessly as I watch TV. 

-	When my boyfriend wears cologne and shaves."
I keep a trash can (with liner!) in my bathroom now. 
"Had a (male) friend over and it just so happened that the only bed sheets that were clean were our bright pink ones covered in hearts. He refused to use the duvet because it was ""like a vagina"". 

He didn't find it funny when I retorted that surely if he was a purely hetero dude he'd love to wrap himself up in vagina. He literally slept *without a duvet. In England. In winter.* because the bed sheets were too ""girly"" for him. He's since made passive aggressive comments that he'll only stay over at ours if we have ""proper"" sheets for him."
"Had an Airbnb in Berlin booked, and last minute the host cancelled. It was a festival weekend so EVERYTHING was booked up. I knew an acquaintance from college who lives in Berlin now, so I messaged her like “i know we’ve not spoken in years but I really need a place to stay, can you pls help?”. She agreed, her flatmate let me in. She got back home at 1 am but we got a drink just to be polite.  Ended up talking until 5 am, had so much in common, just clicked immediately and now she’s one of my closest friends!"

"Booked a little flat in London for a friend and I for a long weekend.  Host was super friendly, flat was nice. Everything seemed to have gone well.

When my plane landed and looked at my messages, the host had sent me a barrage of texts asking why I hadn't told her that I have broken her shower.

I was like wtf? Worked totally fine when we were there. She sent me pics of the showerhead totally ripped from the wall.  I took a shower right before leaving and it worked totally fine and to do that damage, I would have had to get a stool to even reach the showerhead. 

Nevertheless, she left me an awful review.

When I looked through her reviews (most were really great), every now and then there would be the same kind of thing 'so and so totally ruined my sink (or sofa, or overhead lights). It was a pretty subtle insurance scam, imho.  She was quietly, over time, doing renovations to her flat by claiming damange from airbnb guests.  

New pictures of her flat showed a totally new and upgraded shower.  

I'm still salty about that one bad review and experience."
"My husband and I both got checked before our relationship got physical. It’s just being practical. 


And we were 18/19 so any older adult that balks or gets offended has something to hide imo. That’s a red flag to me.

"I make a decent amount of money.  Guys I've dated have reacted to this in pretty absurd ways in the past.

The weirdest one though, was when I got a job offer after college, and I wanted to talk to my friends about the salary amount to see if it was reasonable for the area I was moving, fair, and so forth.  My ex, who had not even found a job yet, tried to forbid me from mentioning it to anyone we both knew because he didn't want them finding out that I may make more money than he did."

Every little detail about your past relationships / sex life.  They don't want to hear it anyway and it can breed insecurity.

"o KAY it is my time to shine. 

My mum is a hairdresser and has access to a lot of products, and I have very fine hair, so I've tried all sorts of products and have had a lot of time to test and try out what works best for me.

I always use a root lifting spray, which keeps your hair from looking flat. I've tried a lot, but my favourite is [Matrix High Amplify Wonderboost](https://www.matrix.com/total-results/styling/high-amplify/high-amplify-wonder-boost) (I think this is the same product, though my packaging looks like [this](http://www.fabliss.net/image/cache/data/Matrix/matrix-total-results-amplify-wonder-boost-root-lifter-8.5-oz-amplify-wonder-boost-root-lifter-800x800.jpg)). Spray at the roots while your hair is still wet, and all over to give your hair full volume. It dries kinda crunchy, but once you brush it out it's great. Runner up is the [Paul Mitchell Extra-Body Boost](https://www.paulmitchell.com/paul-mitchell/extra-body/extra-body-boost/). Matrix has another one called [Volumebloom](https://www.matrix.com/biolage/core/volumebloom/volumebloom-full-lift-volumizer-spray) and it's not good -- don't buy this one.

Another great all-over product is the [Living Proof Full Thickening Cream](http://www.livingproof.com/buy/full-thickening-cream). It's pricey, but will last you a long while (disclaimer: I wash once a week). I prefer to use this with a root lifter, or use a root lifter instead since it's lighter on the hair. 

I always use volumizing shampoos and conditioners, and I generally prefer the Matrix ones. All of theirs are great, though the [Total Results Amplify](https://www.amazon.com/Total-Results-Amplify-Matrix-Conditioner/dp/B005HA9EVE) conditioner smells awful. A great drugstore option is the [L'Oreal Elvive Fibrology line](https://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/products/hair-care/brand/fibrology). Their mask, be warned, is a specifically formulated volumising mask, so it gives your hair kind of a weird texture, but it *is* effective. I would really recommend using shampoos and conditioners formulated for fine hair because others tend to be too heavy and will weigh your hair down. You can get around this with leave-in products, but I do find that the right shampoos/conditioners make a big difference. I use moisturising masks regularly, but always on dry hair (when you hair is actually most absorbent) and never on my roots to prevent weighing my hair down.

Finally, a styling product that is useful is texturising powders. Make sure to dust it over with a light hand, but it gives your hair more texture if it's on the fine side and I usually use it for special occasions or nights out. I have one from [DesignLine](https://www.regissalons.co.uk/shop/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/499x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/o/powder-boost-volumizer-10g-149465.jpg), but I know Got2be also makes one, and you can find them in drugstores. In my experience, they're all more or less the same.

I only wash once a week, and halfway through the week I use dry shampoo. This took years of training, and I wear my hair up a lot, so it may not be a strategy for everyone. My favourite dry shampoo is the [Klorane](https://www.kloraneusa.com/dry-shampoo), but it's super pricey, so I stick with either Dove or Batiste. I would stress not washing as often because it's healthier for your hair, but fine hair gets greasy faster than other textures so it's always a struggle. Fine hair also looks awful when it's dehydrated because it's more prone to static and flyaways, so make sure you're also nurturing your hair and not overprocessing it. 

EDIT: I can't fucking believe I owe my first Reddit gold to my baldness.

"IMO it's less about saving them from depression and more about being a vibrant, but somewhat two-dimensional, enigma that coaxes them into a more adventurous life.

I think I've done this. I didn't feel used, I wasn't trying to be a MPDG, it just describes the way I went about relationships and friendships at a certain point in my life. One deteriorated quickly in a rather spectacular way that ended with me being cheated on. One was a long relationship with an odd end. But really, this role best describes interactions I had with people I didn't date (but who were romantically interested in me). Some I'm still friends with, some I ghosted, some moved away. The most exciting involved someone I asked to prom throwing red koolaid on my Valentine's Day date many years later."
"Im going to echo what /u/OoohMamaJohnnyBravo said about ""looking at issues I face from a female point of view"", but Ill add that I like how relatable some posts are. Its really nice to know that some women can understand my struggles/points of views/beliefs/etc. and vice versa. That has really helped me in relationships since I can get past weird social barriers and just treat her like a person.

I also really appreciate the diversity in answers. Some women love flip flops some cant stand it. Some love a big nose, others dont. There are women who like gaming and some who consider it a deal breaker. Point is, no matter what it is, whether a physical characteristic or a hobby, I can just be myself. There is someone out there who appreciates that 'thing' about me.

Last, I think Ive learned a lot about things Ive always wondered about and couldnt experience without being a girl. Its just cool (and sometimes really sad) to see the world from a woman's perspective :)

"A guy I dated for a few weeks during sophomore year of college very seriously tried to convince me that I should drop out of engineering school and become a waitress, because ""no man wants to date a girl who is smarter than him."" (Because, you know, occupation dictates intelligence.)"
"I lived with an ex-boyfriend and a his best friend for a while. One weekend, I was talking to the best friend, told him that boyfriend and I were going to the glory hole tomorrow, and invited him along. Confusion and hilarity ensued when we discovered that I had never heard of the sex act ""glory hole"" and he had never heard of the waterfall in rural Arkansas named ""the glory hole"". 

It's a real and awesome waterfall. You should look it up!"

"If you are wealthy, you shouldn’t disclose that until you know it’s serious. My friend was dating a woman who was a millionaire, but she kept it so low key that he had no idea. Obviously she wanted a partner who wasn’t there for just her money. He only found out after he proposed. They have been happily married for the last five years."
"Started hiking regularly last year. Maybe this isn't the best line of reasoning but after you burn 1600 calories on a 10 mile hike, you can come home, eat a whole pizza, pass out in bed with a pint of ice cream and you just kinda never gain weight."

"We’ll be hitting the 10 year mark this year (also when we’ll be getting married) and honestly I don’t feel like we really need to go out of our way to show that we’re still into each other. Cause we never stopped being into each other. If anything I’m more crazy about him than I was at the beginning! After all that we’ve gone through in the last decade I cannot imagine my life without this man.

My best advice is to never stop flirting. Don’t stop playing just because you feel like they already have heard everything you have to say. That’s how things get routine, and people *do* notice when that effort goes away. We greet each other with “hey beautiful/handsome” “hey pretty lady” etc. I send him pictures of myself while he’s at work. He always tells me what he loves that I do or teases me just like he did when we were new, rather than just expecting me to do xyz. We still play like new lovers just because it’s *fun*. Things only lose steam when you stop making the effort. Don’t let the point that you feel like you know each other inside and out be the end of the fun, let it be a new beginning."
"My cousin challenged my husband to a gun duel for affronting his sense of honour. 

My dad stopped talking to me for years because he felt entitled to my unquestioning obedience as an adult because he felt has biblical grounds to have full say in what happens in my life. When it became apparent that I have boundaries and take requests but not demands, he stopped having anything to do with me for years because *feminism ruined me as a person* and there was no use in having me in his life if I wasn't exactly the way he wanted me to be because it made him look bad in front of his church friends. 

My ex refused to eat any fruit or vegetables or drink anything other than soda or beer because plants and water were women's food and he didn't want to be seen as girly. He would get angry at the wait staff if there was vegetable garnish on his dish because the other restaurant goers might judge him as a ""pussy vegetarian""."

This morning, he woke me up with a giant chocolate egg and told me he'd set up a little egg hunt around the house (we're 27 and 29). If I go through his phone at any point, I'll find random candids he's snuck of me when he's thought I looked cute. He'll write cute little messages in notepads I've left out, fridge magnets, random scraps of paper, fogged glass. He'll make me endless cups of tea: his personal policy is to never, *ever* turn down a cuppa request from me. He buys me random things he sees on the internet he thinks I'll like - the latest item is a pair of Totoro leggings. He makes me chicken noodle soup when I'm sick, and *somehow* always manages to stave off any personal illness until I'm well again. He tells me I'm beautiful every day.

I grab his butt a lot and make him giggle like a schoolgirl."

Once he came back early without warning and the condition he found me in was, uh, harsh. I was super excited to see him while shamefully asking him not to judge me. 
Funny thing is that when I lived alone I was actually pretty organized. I think it's just the ""short solo vacation with the whole house to myself"" that makes me go full slob."

"Honestly haven't experienced it since high school.

On the opposite end-- one time I was going to a concert and didn't want to hold my bag the whole time, but I had my period and it was summer so I was wearing shorts. Girl shorts have tiny pockets.

And he was just hanging around with tampons in his pockets, even when they searched him before we got in, with not a care in the world."
"For three years I lived in a townhouse where from my bedroom I’d hear the familiar thumps of my neighbors having sex. I assume they could hear the same for me. I always felt amused and weirdly kind of comforted.

However I recently had a guest stay over at my house and had a very different experience. A good friend of my boyfriends was in town visiting so he stayed here with a new girl I had never met before. They all went out but I stayed in because I had to work the next day. At 3 am I was woken up to my guests having loud sex in my living room, which shares a wall with my bedroom where I had been sleeping. I tried to ignore it, but after like 30 minutes I realized they weren’t slowing down I was pissed. So I yelled at them to knock it the fuck off, and they did. That pissed me off and felt disrespectful."

"That women are people

Not coming from a misogynistic place, either.

I grew up with an overbearing mom that raised me to be terrified of women and as a result I'm currently a 20 year old guy with no relationship/sexual experience. Mostly due to the fact that I was brought up to think that women were immaculate.

This sub has helped me realize at the end of the day that women are just people. They aren't some angelic creatures that I need to impress and please every minute of my life.

Women are just like me at the end of the day, they go home and change into gross clothes and take big period shits (because I guess that's a thing)."

If you have a secret kink for broad shoulders, and your SO has narrow ones but you don't care because you love them to bits and are happy in your relationship, just keep mum-- until you've been together a while, or maybe forever. 

Sex has enough vulnerability built in for the first few years; if not getting your kink from your SO isn't seriously impacting your life, why add any more potential fears of inadequacy?

"I have a weird relationship with Gatorade. 

I usually avoid sugar-sweetened drinks, but I keep bottles of Gatorade in my fridge and indulge in them whenever I feel a bad headache coming on. I'm pretty sure it's a placebo effect. The cold sugar water just makes me feel better. It's always the same flavor. Purple Frost ""Riptide Rush"". 

It feels really fucked up that I still drink that particular flavor, like maybe something I should bring up in therapy... 

When I was 15, a 21-year-old ""friend"" tricked me into going out to a beach alone with him by convincing me that it was a party and that a lot of other people I knew and trusted would be there. I  was naive and trusting, so I let him drive me miles out of town to the beach by the river, where there was no party and no one else there except his buddy and a case of beer. This was before cellphones and we were miles from civilization, so there wasn't a lot I could do. He refused to drive me back to town. I probably don't need to go into detail about the rest. You can all figure out why he lied to get me to the beach alone. 

The next morning he drove me back into town and stopped for gas along the way. He asked if I wanted anything. It was the weirdest thing. He was acting like everything was normal. Like everything that had happened was fine, and we were just friends coming home from a road trip. I said I was thirsty, because I think I really really wanted to believe that things were fine and that we were just friends coming home from a normal trip. He came out of the gas station and dropped a bottle of Gatorade Riptide Rush into my lap. "
Why is this so fucking common???? I had a guy tell me once that he wouldn't buy tampons for his daughter. HIS DAUGHTER!!!!! I have never once in my life thought a man holding tampons was purchasing them for himself.... Even if that had been the case I would've assumed he was buying them for a female and honestly would've smiled because good on you for doing a girl in your life a solid!
I like how this started as a worst story but ended up as a best!
"Reddit seems to skew a little more well to do than some of its users realize. A couple days ago on one of the frugal fashion subs, a user politely asked if there was a sub geared more towards $15 or less clothing items because they didn't really have the budget for the $100 items discounted to $80 that get posted to that sub... Downvoted and told that frugal means different things to different people."
"I love my career, and I am really into it. It's not something that I need to spend more than 50 hrs a week at, but it does require my full time attention when I'm there. When my husband and I had our daughter, I thought I'd be staying with her until she went to preschool, so I left my position shortly before I gave birth. 

A little before she was a year old, I couldn't handle staying at home any more and decided to put her in daycare whilst going back to work. I found a new position shortly after she turned one. I loved the year I got at home with her in terms of getting to see those ""firsts"". I have a strong, solid relationship with her now (she's 4.5) and I am the ""preferred parent"" still. What I've found from my own experience is that I rely on my career to define my success and a portion of my happiness. I like playing the ""game"" of what I do for a living and it provides me with validation. My child is happier when I am happier. A happier me is a better parent to her. I'm more patient, more calm, and just a generally more well-rounded person. 

As for being away from work - I quickly picked back up my skill set and moved forward. I'm actually farther along in my career than I think I would have been. Leaving my child, that is the hard part. Each day it does ""hurt"" a little bit. I try to overcome it by making the time we do have special and reminding myself that a calmer/happier me is a better parent for her. YMMV - it really is not a one size fits all experience, but this is what ended up working for me. We are a one-child family, but I'd do it similarly if we did every have a second child. "

"I stayed alone in an airbnb run by a woman who kind of reminded me of Kathy Bates' character on AHS: Coven. Something about her way of speaking and mannerisms were just off to me. Anyways, I was on my period at the time, and I had to swap tampons. I did the socially acceptable thing (mummified the used tampon and threw it away in the garbage can in my bathroom) and thought no more of it. Well, the next morning I got up and she was gone. I went to the kitchen to get some coffee and there it was. My mummified tampon (it is worth noting that the wrappings were now red because science) was within a dixie cup, on a side table.

After I was done and was refilling my water bottle so I could do some cardio, he thanked me for moving the weights back to his settings after I was done each time. I told him that I didn't, he and I just happened to be using the same weight.

His friends immediately started giving him hell for lifting the same weight as a girl. 

I ducked into the bathroom and when I came out the guy was standing in a crowd of people as they piled every weight they could find onto a bar for him to deadlift.

The male ego is a fragile thing."

"Hanging out with a bunch of friends. We started calling each other the opposite gendered equivalent of each other's names (like Alexander/Alexandria) because we were teens that apparently that was fun. Not all of us had names that worked like that. One guy didn't like that someone mentioned his name in female form, and got super offended. He tried coming up with masculine names for those of us with only feminine names, and shouted them like they were insults. The girls that was aimed at were just like ""ok...?"" He was confused that they weren't offended by their made-up masculine names.

"On a pregnancy sub someone asked about personal experiences with epidurals and to rate how painful they were.

"Handmaid.

As a handmaid I'd get my rape scheduled, what, once a month? As a prostitute at Jezebel's, I'd do it every single day and only have the illusion of freedom that would only make me want even more.

Agreed. I think it's a sign of health and maturity to have this conversation *when it makes sense* (if/when sexual play starts escalating and before any fluid exchange).
"Maybe because that's the first ""normal"" thing that happened after that horrible experience and you associate it with healing and pretending it helps. It's the first thing that brought you comfort and was there for you when you desperately needed something...anything.

"I was telling one therapist about some if the stresses at my job, and how several of the babies I worked with were born addicted. It was super challenging and discouraging.

The therapist went on to say that exposure to drugs in the womb does nothing and that *black kids* were just naturally dumber and badly behaved.

Not only were the particular babies in this scenario white (I never mentioned the race of any if the kids, he just assumed an addicted mother must have been black), but there is so much research on how substance use impacts pregnancy! He was literally ignoring science so that he could spew some racist garbage!"
"Booked something in LA for my large family, and the pictures looked great. I booked it quite a few months in advance, and two weeks before we were going, my cousin messages me and says, ""Hey, did you see the latest review?"" It said that the house was trashed and it looked like someone had a rave there, and the house was disgusting and everything. I freaked out, and called the guy. He said that it was true, but he was getting everything fixed before we got there, so it's all good. I felt a little bit better. Finally, the time came when we went, and the place did NOT look like the pictures at all. The house still looked pretty dirty, and there wasn't nearly enough furniture in the house. The carpets were disgusting, the TV was being hung by a string over the fireplace ledge, the furniture that was in the house was dusty and none of us wanted to sit on it, and the faucets didn't work properly. I called the guy again, and he came by the house and tried to fix the faucets but kept saying ""you're getting really good value out of this place. I'll be back with more furniture."" While he left, we found dirty sheets on the floors of the closet, and we weren't sure what was clean and what wasn't. I called him again, and my older cousin was livid. They were yelling at each other because the place we were in wasn't livable, and all the guy kept saying was that ""You're getting really good value for this place!!"" Later on, someone knocks at the door and asks my older cousin, ""Um, who are you?"" My cousin says, ""Who the hell are you?"" The guy says, ""I own this house."" ANNNND that's when it all went down. Turns out the guy I had been dealing with was renting it from the owner, and he had already been warned after that party that no one else could be in that house (neighbors must've warned him). The guy tried to get us to stay, but we contacted Airbnb and got most of our money back except for the first night since it was too late for us to leave."

"16 years, 17 in September. 

I tell her that I love her all the time, we buy each other flowers, take each other on dates, and have endless happy interactions with each other as often as possible. 

The top tier of our loving interactions is cuddling on the couch and sharing memes back and forth on our phones. It’s great. 

We both come on Reddit/social media and see people posting things about relationship goals and then get all giggly that people make memes about us.  

The last sweet thing she did for me was last week. She didn’t murder me when I forgot to pay our health insurance premiums on time. Before that, she came in to my restaurant for dinner (she never comes in). 

She touches my butt all the time, we grab each other boobs constantly, and we don’t always expect reciprocity when we go down on each other. 

We’ve got it goooooood. 

Edit: also we do things like tell people on the internet how good we have it, screenshot it, and send it to each other so we know they know they’re appreciated and loved."

"French fries are from the culinary use of ""french"" which is a verb meaning to cut lengthwise. Also common in the US are frenched green beans.

French doors were developed in France from Italian renaissance windows which were imported after victories in Italy in the late 16th and early 17th century.

French toast was introduced to the US via the Creole dish *pain perdu* and traditionally used french bread.

The french braid is the only one that doesn't have a logical reason. It's likely that it was just associated with high-fashion, and France got caught in the naming."

* Problem: I grew up in a yelling household whereas his parents never yelled. Yelling was a normal part of my conflict resolution and deeply problematic to him
* Solution: I learned how to engage issues without yelling, but without losing the impact or importance of what I was trying to discuss. 
* Problem: He hates crowds and loud parties
* Solution: For important occasions, he sucks it up and does his best to have a good time. He takes breaks when he needs them. I try not to drag him into situations where there will be a huge crowd or a lot of noise unless the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. 
* Problem: I am a klutz and I will spill every drink, bump into every piece of furniture, whereas he's incredibly spatially aware
* Solution: he has to suck it up. I can't change my brain map to be more like his, so he's had to just accept this as part of who I am. 
* He doesn't like to apologize unless he really feels like he's done something wrong. 
* Solution: I require apologies to feel emotionally whole after arguments. I don't need fault admitted, but a simple ""I'm really sorry that conversation was painful"" is good enough. After talking it through over and over and over again, he's redefined what apologies mean to me and I am less exacting over when I need one. 
* Problem: we both get hot under the collar over miscommunication. When there's a situation where what I said is different than what he heard (or vice versa) we're both unusually quick to anger. 
* Solution: after a lot of really dumb fights that came down to, ""Oh, I thought you said something totally different"" we've both trained ourselves to do the pause, step back, ask for clarification dance. Rather than jumping to ""How dare you"" we both try to take a beat, clarify that we heard what we thought we heard, and make sure that it's not a miscommunication. This reduced something like 75% of our bogus fights. 

I could go on. 

**It comes down to this**. MOST THINGS you can compromise on. Some things you can't. I can't be less of a klutz, he's never going to stop being fastidious. There are things innate to your character. Outside of that, most of it is just recognizing patterns of behavior and saying to each other, ""You know, if we did this simple thing instead, then neither of us would be upset and everything would be great"". If you're both willing to change or bend just a few behaviors for the betterment of the other person, life gets a lot simpler. 

I think the trick is finding someone who believes that they can and will bend their behavior. Just a little. Just here and there. If you can find that and reciprocate, you've got a good shot. "

"I had not one, but two friends trying to have sex when I was in the same bed as them. My friends tended to have a thing where we'd pull mattresses together to sleep or share king sized beds if I slept over after a night of drinking. Both of those girl friends had guys they were interested in and just started going at it *in the same bed as me*. The first time it happened, I could hear them whispering about being quiet because I was 'asleep' and I couldn't find out. I felt oddly violated and paralyzed, so I didn't say anything until the next day. The second time, I got pissed right as soon as I realized it was happening."
"His diet made him sick. He blamed me for him getting diabetes.

"My ex. So many issues...

We bought a coffee table and side tables at IKEA and I put together one of the side tables while he was out because I like doing that stuff. He got home and I proudly showed off my work, suggesting we could do the coffee table together while watching a movie. He got super angry, saying he wanted to do it all and it’s his job. He went to the bedroom and pouted the rest of the night. I had to wait a few days before he had time to put the other two together, as I wasn’t allowed to touch them. 

Our female dog could not wear girly colors when he walked her. She had a blue and black harness and black leash and everyone said “what’s his name?” Then he’d get annoyed and say “HER name is...” 
When I moved out I bought her a purple collar, leash, and harness. 

Got pissed at me for commenting to some friends that I did our taxes. Cuz you know, it makes it look like he couldn’t do them. (So, the truth)

If there was any topic I was more knowledgeable about, we couldn’t discuss it anymore because it would make him feel bad because he’s the man and supposed to be smarter. 

I couldn’t use the term “butthurt” to describe him because that’s gay. 

He drove a friend’s car a few hours away as a favor and covered up the equality sticker on the bumper so that the strangers on the freeway wouldn’t think he was gay.

I’m sure there are more that I’ve blocked out.

"I had a guy project that archetype on to me once. It was weird and very annoying. I suppose there's a tinge of something ""alternative"" about me even though I'm not really into any scene, but I never act cutesy. He was a few years older than me and, in my opinion, kind of a bland guy but he had a decent body. His main interests were skateboarding and skiing, two things I have no interest in. He would always go on about how he'd ""never met anyone like me before"" and would call me things like ""cute"" and ""sweet"" and tell me that I reminded him of Miranda July. He seemed floored by the fact that I have a wide variety of interests. We were sort of going out when I turned 22 and he bought me an expensive hoodie with a skate brand logo emblazoned on the front that was 2 sizes too large and in a color I would never wear. It was obviously 90% about what he wanted to see in me. All he needed was for someone to be attractive and just a tiny bit odd and his imagination to run wild and he would superimpose his MPDG onto me. He called me something like 27 times the day I told him I didn't want to hang out with him anymore. I never even dignified this ""relationship"" with exclusivity or called him my boyfriend, he just latched on with very little encouragement. "
"I don’t see the point of putting “good china” on the registry. Fancy, expensive plates that you have to store in a special place, that you take out once or twice a year... and after your wedding you’ll end up having to spend more money on china to complete your set (because, inevitably, you’ll have an odd number of everything, with people making a-la-carte purchases off of your registry).

Ask for or buy a really great set of tableware that you can use all the time, and that looks good enough to use when “fancier” plates might be required. Spruce the table up with great napkins and a centerpiece rather than expensive plates and stemware when the occasion calls for it."
Omg. I didn't even think of that. Please excuse me while I go die now.
my comments on the vented versus non-vented dryer...I can't think of a *less* controversial subject. I can't imagine caring enough to downvote *any* comments on a clothes dryer.
"I guess it goes without saying that there isn't exactly a real life model for this, but I feel like I played this role a bit in my last relationship. In many ways it felt great. I felt like I was teaching my partner to play for the first time in his life. He has clinical depression, and while he has it under control in his life it does impose an inertia that makes it hard for him to be impulsive or to try new things. It was rewarding feeling like my presence was actually improving things for him somehow. All the firsts we had together made things that had been fairly mundane for me exciting again. Spontaneous camping or road trips, playful sexuality, getting lost trying to watch the Perseids.. It all suddenly meant more to me because it meant so much to him.

The biggest thing that made it fulfill that fantasy was him moving across the country (to a city he never would have considered otherwise) for me after I impulsively accepted a job offer in another state. He'd wanted to go to the west coast anyway, and his career is now moving forward really well. I didn't do anything to help him with that, just provided some inspiration for him to change. Also felt really nice.

BUT. This is real life and I didn't get to just make things better and fade out. Mania is more often than not accompanied by depression, which he had to deal with. He also was young and in love and wanted a stable, long term, and monogamous relationship with me. I broke his heart by not being able to be that person to him. He realized he couldn't handle the dynamic and ended it.

Did not feel used, but that's probably because of the things that made the real life experience different from the trope. Like any decent relationship, there was a give and take. He didn't just ride my highs, he helped me through some of my lows."
"Refusing to let me open doors. It is nice to have someone hold doors open sometimes- especially if I am carrying a big bag or in heels. I know some people are flattered by this and it is a nice gesture, regardless of gender. 

But I met a guy who simply refused to let me get near a door handle and would race me to hold it open when I was only an arms length away from one. On top of that,  he would not walk through it if I held it open for him, doing that awkward standoff with an open door in front of us. Seriously dude, I don’t think you are less of a man for letting me get doors and I am perfectly capable of opening doors myself! "

"It’s hard for me to even begin to say what my dad did right, because it felt like he did everything right. He’s my best friend and the best person I’ve ever known. 

But, here’s a start. First: quality time. My childhood memories are full of quality time with my dad, having all sorts of adventures. Going down to the river to search for frogs. Building terrariums to house caterpillars and watch them turn into butterflies. Sometimes, on a weekend, we’d do a spontaneous camping trip with no prior planning; just huck the tent in the car and go somewhere just for the hell of it.

He read books to me every night. Later on, he made up a running serialized fantasy story just for me, adding a new “chapter” every night. I’d usually fall asleep in the middle, so he took to recording himself so that he could remember what he’d said, and rewind for the next night. 

He took time off work to chaperone school field trips. We played chess and a lot of adventure games (early Sierra games on the computer). And so forth, and so on. 

I’m now 36 and my dad is almost 80, and when I look back on why our relationship is so good, I always go back to that quality time. It is precious beyond money. It can’t be bought, and can’t ever be recovered once it’s passed, and I wouldn’t trade a minute of it for the world. 

Moving on. Whenever I had an interest, my dad was *all in.* He’d listen to me babble about it for weeks, showing just as much legitimate interest as when I began. And kids fly through interests, but my dad gave his full support and encouragement to each one. When I got into dinosaurs, we did palaeontology tours. When I got obsessed with the Titanic, we built a model Titanic kit together. When I got big into animation and wanted to be an artist, he got me a light table. When I wanted to learn an obscure language, he arranged for me to meet academics that studied it and take classes. 

Awhile ago, I found a “novel” I wrote in a notebook when I was five years old. In the front, I added a dedication: “To My Dad, Who Has Always Enjoyed My Work.” To me, that says it all. My dad was always my number one fan and biggest supporter. Through him, I learned to explore my curiosity to the fullest, and try things out and just enjoy them. I am so grateful for that. 

In regards to gender specifically, what always stands out to me about my dad is how he didn’t just tell me that women could do anything, he modelled it. He had women friends, and read books by women authors. He was vocally proud of the accomplishments of his female post-grad students, and often spoke of his admiration for various female colleagues and their work. 

That modelling is so important, I think. It’s one thing to say it, another to see that you should *expect* the men in your life to take you and your ambitions and accomplishments seriously. 

Other little things: my dad never judged. He let me make mistakes, knowing that he’d give advice and help me fix it, but wouldn’t judge me or yell at me. As I hit my teen years and beyond, I always knew I could call him if I needed help and he’d come, no questions asked. He let me be myself and respected me enough to make my own decisions. And he supported me through them, even when they weren’t ones he would have chosen. When I got my first tattoo, I mean, he wasn’t thrilled, but he sighed and smiled and helped me put the healing gel on it. 

Above all, he was just present in my life in a healthy and emotionally available way. Always and forever. Even today, there’s a lot that I need his help to work through, and he is always there. I don’t know where I’d be without him. "
"A few people downvoted me and asked me what the fuck was wrong with me because I said that the poster (whose boyfriend’s family invited themselves on vacation with the couple) should try to make the best of the time away.

Uh, no, that isn't how STIs work. There is a 3 month gap from exposure that certain tests take to come back positive. Plus the fact you won't always transmit.

This hasn't happened 1 or 2 times. This has been the case for the majority of men I've been with.

"I've stayed in two Airbnbs: one in London, one in Dublin. Made the mistake of ignoring the check-in time for London's for reasons I can't remember. We had a few hours until we could pick up the key and were too tired to explore (and drag our luggage) so we camped out in the airport for a few hours until the staff told us they were closing the arrivals lobby. Took a cab to the pub where we were supposed to pick up the key, walked around the block for fifteen minutes until they opened. The key wasn't there. Host was unreachable by phone, was having someone else drop the key off at the pub. Had a beer, then another beer. Didn't get the key until about an hour and a half after the agreed check-in time. There were supposed to be instructions on how to get in the building and which unit it was, which were conveniently left out of the envelope. Bartender knew the building, but not the unit number. We ended up trying the key in every unit that sounded unoccupied across two floors before we finally figured out which one it was. Two days in the lights in half the studio stopped working. Notified the host, but never got a response. Took showers by the light of our cell phone flashlights. Wrote a review for them, but they never wrote a review for us.

Dublin's was amazing. We had an adorable one bedroom apartment near the Guinness storehouse. The host emailed us a month ahead of time to let us know there was roof work scheduled for when we were there and said we could cancel if that would inconvenience us, or he'd give us a discount. We took the discount, and the construction was not a huge deal at all. He met us in person when we arrived, gave us some recommendations for food and attractions, and even left us some cookies and a bit of milk for coffee! "

"With women: For me it's when it is by men, for men, without regard for a female audience. When women are framed like objects more than they are people. It's especially annoying in a movie or show when the story stops dead so the viewers can take a moment and ogle at a female who has an exceptionally beautiful face or body (Star Trek Into Darkness with its gratuitous shot of Carol changing springs to mind). It's annoying and distracting, and I think in some ways equally insulting to men because it treats them like they're all dogs. Either give women equal amounts of eye candy with the dudes or knock it off.

With men: I think that it's the inverse and we treat male bodies like they're the less beautiful alternative and therefore hold less worth. I rarely see men framed with the same flattering lighting, shadows and angles as I do women, but often instead they're naked for the sake of comedy or serve as the foreground for some violent backdrop. It seems like male nudity often correlates with them being deprived of something. Media seems almost afraid of the male body unless it's being destroyed, laughed at, or it's in something made primarily for a gay audience, and I find that pretty degrading."

"Bulbasaur is the best original starter to pick by any objective measure of quality. It is super effective against both Brock's rock type and Misty's water type as well as the Geodudes of Mt. Moon. The first gym to potentially give Bulbasaur trouble is Sabrina's psychic Pokemon or even later at Blaine's fire type in Cinnabar. The only potentially dangerous part of the game for Bulbasaur is the forest with all the bugs but you can get a Pidgey easily to make that not even a threat. 

Picking anything but Bulbasaur is just handicapping yourself in the beginning. "

"Jesus Christ. This totally reminds me of my idiot ex. 

He would shoo two of my male cats away from one another when they were snuggling and grooming each other (which they would do very often because they were an incredibly bonded pair), because he didn’t want to live in the same home as “faggot cats”. Dude was a piece of shit who is still the prime example of fragile masculinity in my life to this day. 


Edited to add, whenever this happened I was quick to remind him those “faggot cats” pre-dated him by several years, and if he didn’t want to live with them, he was quite welcome to move the fuck out. "
"Not a hairstylist but I worked in salons for years.

The absolutely worst thing beyond the obvious (late, rude, smelly) was people who expected you to turn them from Kate from Jon and Kate plus 8 to Kate Middleton with one photo. They show you a reference photo of a gorgeous model with either gorgeous hair or a gorgeous wig, and they expect you to turn their beat to hell breakagefest into that in two hours. Stylists can give you highlights and layers, but they can’t change your hair texture or magically pull longer thicker hair out of their ass, and they sure as hell can’t change your face."

To name a few: The pink tax, which involves women's products being much more expensive(artificially more so) than equivalent men's or gender-neutral products.

Women being sexualized(and sexually harassed) from young ages, relative to men. It's sickening, really. 

It's important to know though that although women face many issues, so do men. Neither are more or less important than the other. Working to resolve these deeply embedded issues is a societal effort rather than a gender-specific one. "
"The only things I keep from my husband are any surprises I've bought him or if a friend tells me something and makes it clear that it isn't for anyone else's ears or is something that I think they wouldn't want my husband to know.  He's the same way.  

Beyond that we basically share everything.  "
"I went to a game night with some friends, and it turned out most of the other ladies they invited were from a church group.

One girl in the group was in particular all about Purity and my friends were going on about how she's so sheltered and they must protect her and stuff. I was pretty dubious. These were all 24-28 year old women, not teenagers.

At one point during the game night, someone said something about pedophilia, and the Sweet Innocent One asked, ""What's pedophilia?""

Honestly to this day I'm convinced her whole shtick is an act because of that moment. Something about her reaction, plus the fact that the word pedophile is one you can hear from a variety of everyday sources and such, just made me think she was faking a lot of her so-called sheltered background. "

"Before I checked it out myself, the sub was described to me as a ""flower-power echo-chamber,"" among other, less polite titles. I'm pleasently surprised to find that most of it was bullshit.

There's been a lot of really insightful threads about men/women and women/women relationship dynamics that I wasn't *fully* aware of. The general ideas I thought I had didn't compare to the in-depth examples and anecdotes I've seen on here. Things like body positivity, feelings of intimidation (as a reasonably large guy this is something I've been blissfully ignorant of up till that point) and some of the bullshit expectations you have to put up with. I usually lurk here compared to my activity in other subs, because I don't really have anything to contribute, but I've learned a lot from you guys, so thank you.

It really isn't possible for men to understand women's lives unless they're willing to listen and learn. And while I feel that's a discrepency that goes both ways, and needs to be addressed both ways, I'm glad to say that I'm a little closer on my end than I was before I found you guys. So thank you. =D"

I spent time with my dad and we know each other pretty well. For a long time we were pretty close.

"what i learned was the depth to which a lot of men suck.

i was raised by women. dad left the picture when i was 3. so there was my mom, a couple of aunts, a grandmother, 2 much older sisters. periods hold no surprises for me. most things about the intimate and internal care and feeding of a ladyperson i knew before i hit high school.

but while i knew that some guys are assholes and harass and mistreat women, it was, in my mind, the rare exception. 

i'm a big guy. six foot three. 250ish pounds. medium beard. (it's purple, but still)  but i'm friendly. always a 'hi, howare ya?"" to everyone i see. (i'm southern. we say hi to everyone we come across. )

and it slowly crept through my head that because i'm large, and because i'm a guy, some random woman might be afraid of me, just because i'm .. me. that smiling and saying hi to some girl as i pass them on the sidewalk may not come off as just some being friendly doofus, and that my thought of being friendly might have just legit terrified some poor girl who just wanted to get pizza on the way home, and is now looking back to make sure i didn't stop to follow her.

i learned that if i'm waiting someplace (like at a corner for the light or something) and if there is a woman there with me, *especially* if it's one lady by herself, and it's just the two of us standing there to make sure i step off and distance myself from them - or even go out of my way to cross the street, just so she doesn't feel threatened. 

it was never something i thought of. i'm just a big doofus, and the idea of assaulting someone just isn't part of who i am. that was obvious.. right? big goofy grin, big goofy guy plodding along. big friendly ' hey, howya doin?' no threat to anyone. Right? 

but they don't know me. and they don't know that. so unless my wife or kids are with me, i don't wave or say hi to women anymore, because it might not be seen as i'd intended.

it's not the only thing i've learned here.. but i think it might be the most important. and the most depressing."

When I visit my SO (we're long distance) we hear his neighbours having really loud and rough sex sometimes. Often it's loud enough to wake both of us up in the mornings. It was kind of funny at first, but it's gotten to a point where we're kind of freaked out and also a bit worried what that guy is doing with that Lady, because she screams and moans as if he would sacrifice her to Satan.

Also, they're 60+ in age, sooo I guess good for them? "

It isn't common to see a woman bent over rowing, so I kinda figured"". We get to chatting and it's going great. We talk for close to 15 minutes, each breaking to do a set and then coming right back to conversation. He told me his max weights for the 3 main lifts, squats being at 275lbs for a set of 3. I praised him on those numbers and told him to keep going. At the very end of the conversation he asked me what my squat max was. I said ""391lbs"". He choked on his words in an audible cough and said ""Did you say 3...?"" I nodded. He actually gathered up his things and said ""alright, well, you have a nice workout"" and left the gym. :/  "

We always flirted and became FWB sr year but it didn't work out for a variety of reasons I won't get into, and we lost contact after graduation. I always considered him ""the one that got away"" and regretted how things ended, never stopped wondering ""what if"". 4 years later, we were both single and ran into each other at a local dive bar and instantly became inseparable again. Started dating about a month later and have been together almost 6 years now. I've never been happier. "

Who I like better but still NOT OK. "
"Honestly the only real incompatibility we’ve come across so far (it’s been 5.5 years) is that I like to be very punctual/early to things while he tends to take the “roll up at the last minute/a little late” approach. Tbh it mostly just impacts things like meeting up for movies so I usually either agree to buy the tickets/concessions while I wait for him or just go see things by myself (we’re both pretty independent so neither of us mind) and watch them with him later. I’ll also explain to him *why* I like getting places early to help him see my perspective. 

Other than that, we’re pretty compatible on all of the big stuff which is why I think we’ve been so stable over the years."
"I was told I shouldn't be depressed since I had a good upbringing, supportive family &amp; friends, and good grades. It wasn't like a, ""look at all the things you have to be happy about,"" either, it was more like a command he was giving me, brought on by disbelief.

Do not buy a kitchenaid mixer unless you like to cook and you can come up with more than one way you'd regularly use it.  It's not a magic item that comes up with ways to use itself.  It's expensive, takes up space, and it's *heavy*.

"Booked an Airbnb (a maisonette) for new year in Amsterdam. We get there and the host warns us his downstairs neighbour is crazy and hates noise. We tell him no problem, we're not a noisy bunch. One night we stayed up until about 1am chatting in the living room and then we all went to bed. I woke up at 3am and realised my mouth tasted of weed so I went and brushed my teeth downstairs.

The next day we got an angry message from our host that his neighbour called the police to file a noise complaint at 3am and he was kicking us out. He said his neighbour hates him due to Airbnb... Not our problem. Before we responded we called Airbnb to get all our ducks in a row and they basically said he couldn't throw us out and if he did they'd find us somewhere.

I think Airbnb must have then contacted him because he was suddenly backpedalling like mad, saying he wasn't going to kick us out. He just had a stupid feud with the neighbour that was none of our business and my toothbrush is not loud enough lol"

"I was with a guy for 2 years. He liked me more than i liked him, and 100 percent turned into this archetype. (The glitter might be arguable) anyway, he thought I could make him happy. I saved him from depression, he was living with his family and was 28, never lived alone... I moved in with him to his first apartment. Encouraged him to get a higher wage job, and pursue his hobbies. Helped pay off his car. 
To be honest I used him to help support me while I got back on my feet after moving cross country. Once he proposed to me I broke up with him. It was really shitty and i hated that i did it, but I turned his life around, and ran off. I miss his sweet, loving family more than him. We didn't have a lot in common, and i knew I had to leave before I getting tied up, etc. It worked out in the end but emotionally really difficult.

Edit:
Had to add on that i didn't expect the relationship to go this way. It started out innocent enough and good intentions, but when I realized what he was projecting on to my I just sort of shrugged and went with it because he was supporting me too."

I just gave him [this look](https://img.maximummedia.ie/joe_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvbWVkaWEtam9lLm1heGltdW1tZWRpYS5pZS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3dwLWNvbnRlbnRcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE1XFxcLzAzXFxcLzIwMTY0NzUzXFxcL29mZmljZWFubm95ZWQuZ2lmXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjc2NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjQzMSxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmpvZS5pZVxcXC9hc3NldHNcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2pvZVxcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmc_dj01XCJ9IiwiaGFzaCI6IjM3NTBhNjM0ODY5NWEzYzAwZDUwMmQ1ODFmZGEwZjlmNWY3ZGJmNTkifQ==/officeannoyed.gif) for the rest of the time he was around.
"I always assumed bras were designed for comfort, but it seems like a big reason why they are worn, both by here and my gf, is to not show nips. Otherwise they can be a huge pain in the arse"
"I was on a dating website. Some piece of work kept messaging me every couple of days with a lackluster ""hey baby girl"". I just didn't respond. 

Eventually messaged:
""Got small tits don't ya""

Suffice to say, I felt like I could hear his masculinity breaking through my phone. The whole thing honestly just cracked me up. I guess he thought it was equivalent to telling a man he has a small penis? It didn't bother me though lol"
My dad did the grocery shopping in the house and a couple times I even had him text me pics of the different boxes to make sure he was buying the right ones. Lol. Dad dgaf 
"You're not alone. I can meet a hundred guys and only be attracted to one. I've always envied women who always have a man in their life. It's almost like they're attracted to anyone. You might be picky and judgmental, like me. One wrong comment, and my interest disappears. Example. I was talking to a guy about quitting smoking and he was adamant that nicotine was not addictive. He immediately identified himself as a stubborn hardhead. Why would I want to date someone like that? 

You might have a highly refined screening process and that's a good thing. I have always said I would rather spend the night with a good book than a boring man. Relax, sooner or later your 1 in 100 will show up. Sometimes, trying too hard sabotages our efforts. "
"At work, and not on my lunch break either. Paid to poop. "
"Wish people could see past holding down a job or career as the only measure of success or avenue to fulfillment... I'm currently leeching off my husband right now because... life? Does it really matter? 

This is just our situation, I've played sugar momma to him before for years. I work my ass off around the house - from the laundry to lawn care, I keep a large garden, make a wide variety of crafts, volunteer, I'm constantly researching and getting out into the field to hone my skills. He's happy with things whether or not I'm employed, I'm pretty happy but the shame is rough.

BTW - we're planning on slowly expanding my horticultural and husbandry skills into a small subsistence farm, and I'm developing the skills and familiarity with the land I need to work as a guide. I'm keeping up my medical certs. Different strokes for different folks. "
"Yes this is good advice, do not approach women in a pubic place. "
"We met online and I was kind of bummed leaving our first date because he was so attractive, smart and sweet that I was expecting a ""nice to meet you... see you around!"" text afterwards. Months of seeming to only attract weirdos had me convinced he was out of my league. Joke's on me - we're married now! "
"Seriously, the thing that has been most eye opening to me, is knowing that ""danger"" is always on the back of your minds. As a mostly carefree guy, I assumed everybody is the same, its honestly sad. I mean I know there's inequality and stuff, but I never imagined fearing for your safety 24/7.

On a lighter note, due to this realization I finally figured out why you guys do things in groups, even going to the bathroom. I was like ""oooohh, that's why!"" 

Edit: not something I learned from this subreddit, but from experimenting. You guys are super humans for doing all the things you do in heels. I got curious once and tried them on, couldn't stand still for a millisecond 😂"
"Forearms are one of the easiest ways for a guy to be sexy. Even out-of-shape guys tend to have pretty muscular/lean forearms, and arm hair is masculinely sexy. Having nice forearms can be on par with having nice cleavage.

Calves can be in the same category, FYI."
I'm mad at him for you... 
"My favorite has been at the dog park. I saw a super bro-y guy (younger, jacked, and wearing Harley gear) bring his unfixed pit bull to the dog park, and the dog immediately starts playing with a couple other dogs, one of which starts humping the pit.

Dude runs from the other side of the dog park, yelling and waving his arms, ""Noooo! He's a boy dog! HE'S A BOY! HE'S A BOYYYY!"""
You’re a great person.
"I was always second best in my last relationship. Always. Everything came before me. If I had a dollar for every time I went over to his house, and he completely ignored me in favor of playing his bass guitar, I could pay off Sallie Mae.

Unfortunately, he was also mentally and emotionally abusive, and throughout the years we were together (4 1/2), he made me believe that my unhappiness was my fault, and that our relationship was awful because of me (and not the fact that he cheated on me 3 times. Go figure.)

One day, though, I just realized that I had had enough. I didn't even wait to see him again. I just texted him and said I didn't want to date him anymore, and he said he didn't really want to date me either, so it was basically mutual.

I'll tell you, though, it took me an extremely long time to get over that. It's been 7 years this spring since I broke up with him, and being single this entire time, I still have those doubts in the back of my mind. I still feel second best to people. It sucks, but I'm actively working on it."
Honestly if you don't hate women and can laugh at yourself you're probably in the top 50% of dateable men. 
How the government wants to reduce abortion rates but won't cover birth control under health insurance. 
"I have anxiety, and it’s impossible for anyone but me to pull myself out of that mindset if the negative thought loop gets bad enough. My partner helps sometimes by just being there and cuddling with me. To help I’ve been working with a therapist and practicing mindfulness techniques. It’s hard, but rest if you need to, eat if you haven’t in a while, and give yourself grace. We’re all perfectly imperfect."
"That is an aspect of sex positivity I don't like, which is a shame because sex positive should be a good thing. But instead it reads as yay, everyone must love all sex all the time, vanilla nerds are boring, sex is the most important thing on earth, SEEEEX, KINKY SEX! As someone with a pretty low sex drive I just find it hard to identify with the movement a lot of the time."
ASOS is my absolute go-to. But I’ve found there are some surprisingly good deals on Hollister - I’m obsessed with their high waisted jeans.
"I had neighbors who once did that. Except it was a married man cheating on his wife who was my friend. I could always hear when it was getting started between the adulterous two right by this wall in my kitchen. I would wait five minutes until things were getting really heated, then put a stereo playing this song on full blast right up to the wall: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU_5fSMq3rA

The part where the child chorus starts singing is the best XD

I would also replay the song for about half an hour, just to make sure they got the message lol

One time, I heard him say ""Fuck!"" in a pissed off voice lol

Bastard."
"I was very worried coming into this thread, thinking it would be the nail in the coffin that is me dying alone..

I'm leaving pleasantly surprised, and full of hope. Thank you ladies. "
But it smells like boiled eye of newt in here!
"My psychiatrist/therapist told me he wasn't going to write any more prescriptions for me because I was abusing meds due to having been raped, and that after three months I should've already gotten over it (I couldn't even talk about it by then).

Got a new psychiatrist ASAP and she diagnosed me with PTSD..."

"I've said this before, and I'll say it again because it's a message that needs repeating to people that think like this - but when it comes to anything ""embarrassing"" like pads, tampons, condoms, lube, etc the cashier is likely not thinking anything about what you're buying. Because the cashier is just scanning shit and whether it's apples or tampons or condoms, it's just product they're moving through the register. When you do the same thing everyday for hours on end, you don't really pay much attention to what people are actually buying. 

I say this as someone who was a cashier for years at a place that sold all this stuff. And if you're worried if other people in line are looking at what you're buying, I'm going to go ahead and say that 98% of them aren't paying attention to you because they're wrapped up in their own heads or on their phones. 

Basically, when shopping if you're worried about what someone is going to think about your purchase, get over yourself and remember that no one really cares but you. "
"Should preface this with the fact I'm Australian.   
  
**ASOS** - I use it a lot so I've had premier delivery for a few years now and I find it's definitely worth it. Free express delivery/returns. I don't use it to buy Asos brand stuff at all, though.

"Booked a place to stay for two extra nights because I want see an art exhibition by my favorite artist. The exhibition is 8 hours round trip away (Could've stay a night there but decided not to haul my luggage around). After coming back to the airbnb that night, my host asked me what I did that day. I told him I went to this art exhibition 4 hours away, and he thought I was crazy. Then he told me the airbnb I'm staying at is actually the same artist's old home in the 80s/90s. Even showed me part of the house where he hand painted the walls/ceiling."
"20 is still pretty young dude. Half the battle is realising that the opposite sex are just people like you. A lot of people never have that realisation.

I guess my boyfriend has been cheating on me with his female dog then. Or wait... would that make ME the other woman??
"This is something I struggle with constantly.  Once had a guy over after a few dates and offered to cook him dinner (I love to cook).  He comes over and will not shut up about my apartment.  ""It looks like straight from a magazine!  How much is your rent?  Where'd you get your sofa?"" Genuine curiosity is just fine but then he proceeded to drink half a bottle of whiskey, eat the entire chicken I cooked (hey, I'm a pretty good cook), and drunkenly confess that he'd never be able to live up to my expectations.  Even though I told him I wasnt expecting anything from him - least of all financially since I obviously do it on my own just fine - he just couldn't get over it.  

The next guy I tried to date I wouldn't let come over to my apartment.  He thought I was weird for that until I offered to drive us to Ikea (he wanted help picking out a new bed...ahem..we had broken his).  After seeing the look on his face when he saw the car I drove I knew it was over.  He ended things shortly after that."

"One of my friends, I have intense chemistry with. I think it's because he's intelligent and sexy and when I first met him, I wanted to be with him even though I had a boyfriend. His girlfriend was even cool with it. But I realized that I would have a better life with my boyfriend. Then my boyfriend and I broke up and I found a sexy British dude. Always go for the sexy British dude."

I reconnected with that friend later and she told me those were the most depressing years of her life because the other friend was manipulative and threatening to commit suicide if she ever didn't spend every second of her free time with her. She knew she was being excluded from the rest of the group and even though we had known each other since childhood, she felt she couldn't talk to me about what our other friend was doing to her because she thought we all hated her. 

We are great friends now and I've apologized and she's (thankfully) forgiven me."

I work at a coffee shop and a dude came in to order a “not girly drink”.

I'm honestly angry with myself for having low self esteem and dealing with it for 5 years."

"At the beginning and ending stages of my period I have delusions. I realize what they are, and largely keep them to myself because I know they are not real, but they can still be very emotionally taxing. I call it ""uterus brain."" Sometimes when my SO can tell what's up and he asks me about it, he'll generally take ""uterus brain"" as an answer. Occasionally, though, he'll ask me about what kind of delusions they are (they're usually about him, my work, my family, or my health) and then he'll get upset if they're about him!! 

That is why I don't disclose them to him even when they're about him--I place no weight in them because they have no basis in reality and because they blow over quickly."

"I get downvoted for tons of innocuous shit.

Recently there was a thread on what major are good for job stability. I mentioned that it depends on your location, then named a few that could lead to lifelong job security in my country. Still don't know whether random downvotes, downvoted for un-American answer, or downvoted for suggesting humanities aren't a guaranteed one-way ticket to unemployment.

There was also a thread asking people to post timeline of their life's events. I did. Got downvoted.

A while back, on a thread about what you'd do if you got accidentally pregnant, I said I'd keep it. Got told I shouldn't, because I shouldn't bring into the world a baby I can't raise and will resent blablabla. I pointed out that the person knew nothing about my life, that I could raise and love the baby without resentment, and that this was my choice. Several downvotes while that person got upvoted."

Cutting out an extremely toxic friendship.
I remember when I was a smoker I loved the smell. It reminded me of my father who had passed when I was young. I remember going to his family’s house and everyone would be sitting together in the living room enjoying a cigarette. It really comforts me whenever I smell cigarettes. Unfortunately it made it rather hard to kick the habit. But whenever I see a pack I always think of my dad and his family. It gives me a deep sense of nostalgia.

"I’ve been doing IF on and off now for about 5 months. I’m not super strict with it so the weight is coming off a little more slowly but something it’s doing is teaching me better habits, like not eating anything when yo get home at night.

The first couple of weeks are the hardest because your brain has been hard wired over the years to be in a fed state all the time. Getting over that mental barrier was the hardest thing about this. 

I started at 238lbs and now I’m at around 205lbs. I can’t wait to make my way under 200. It’s been a while since I’ve seen that number.

EDIT - almost forgot. I also don’t beat myself up if I ruin my fast or go out with my friends or indulge on a holiday. Life is still life and so long as your good days have become a habit, one bad one won’t ruin your progress..... the same way eating one salad won’t make you skinny.

Quite a few years later, when I was an adult, I learned that this man was abusing my friend and cheating on his wife who eventually divorced him and he died a sad lonely alcoholic death a short time later. I hate so much knowing and remembering that but the aromatic flavors of his peanut butter toast still evoke such happy memories of those days with my friend. "

"I remember there was an askreddit about the worst sex experience you've ever had and a woman said that the guy she hooked up with made her bleed somehow (can't remember the specifics). She said something along the lines of ""sex shouldn't make you bleed"" and was CRUCIFIED by sex positive~ people who yelled about how their partner makes them bleed/they make their partner bleed and it's all fine and dandy and you shouldn't criticise what gets other people off. 

I feel like those people who claim to be sex positive but can't handle anyone not enjoying exactly the same kind of sex as they do feel like it's a personal attack on them whenever someone says ""I'm not willing to try x"", which, to me, SHRIEKS of insecurity about something.  My fiance and I are into some things that not everyone is, but I'm not going to come on here and cry that everyone who isn't open to try what we like is ""kink shaming"" us.

Another issue I take with ""sex positivity"" is how I have yet to see anyone criticise a man for saying he doesn't want to take a submissive role in the bedroom, he doesn't want to be fucked by a strapon or what have you. It seems to be only women who are called out for not liking xyz (in my experience. Maybe I'm wrong, but I just haven't see it). It seems to be people pressuring women to push their boundaries to accommodate their male sexual partners, which to me is the opposite of sex positivity.

I guess I'm sex positive in the sense that I think sex is perfectly normal and a part of life and nothing to be ashamed of. I'm not going to judge you for however many sexual partners you've had. What I *do* take issue with are the sex positivists who seem to only want women to bend over backwards (literally and figuratively) for their male partners while said male partner isn't expected to do jack shit for the woman.

"I LOVE my job. Before the baby, I could easily put in 60+ hours a week. My maternity leave was 6 weeks. Because I work from home, my plan was to watch the baby while at work. I'm not sure why I thought this, but for some reason I thought having a baby would miraculously make me soooo in love with my baby, that work would pale in comparison. That definitely didn't happen. I love my son, but my job is still so important to me. 

The first two weeks after the baby came I was too exhausted to care or miss working. After two weeks, I was dying to feel normal again, so I tried doing a little bit of work when the baby napped. It was pretty frustrating, because I didn't get 8-10 hour stretches of work anymore. 

By the time 6 weeks was up, I realized we needed a nanny. It worried me a little, because I was SO DESPERATE to get a break from my baby, that I thought maybe I had PPD (I didn't - turns out, I just don't desire to be a stay at home mom).  I'm SO glad I opted for childcare. Work would have been impossible. 

Currently, my baby is 4.5 months old. The nanny is here until 4pm every day. My son goes to bed at 6:30, so I have 2.5 hours with him in the evenings, and about 2 hours with him in the mornings. Even though I work from home, and can see him whenever I'd like - I really dont go to him too much because there's a lot of work to do. I do miss him during the day, but I'm honestly soooo glad to have a normal working schedule again. And then, I'm really excited to see him at 4 :-). 

Of course with a baby, there will be sacrifices. For me, I've definitely given up the extended work hours, time with friends, sleep, and a little bit of personal care time. I refuse to sacrifice a clean house (it's actually pretty easy to keep things clean when I'm wearing him in his carrier), my marriage (def gotta make time for my partner) and the normal working hours.

He eventually got a divorce, I eventually ended my relationship (mutual break up). We ended up meeting a few months later, moved in together, got married. Happy since! "
"Last month the bus driver said ""it's not criminal to be happy on a Wednesday"" as I got off because I wasn't smiling. My cat had passed away two days ago, hence why I wasn't smiling. I was kind of shocked and had no idea what to say so I ignored him and obviously didn't smile. 

I really wish people realised that you aren't entitled to a smile from a stranger. You don't know what's going on in their lives."
"&gt; The Houdini:
&gt; 
&gt; ok, the real definition is this: You are doing a girl doggy style whilst she if facing a window to the outdoors...half way thru your thrusting, you do a pull out move (to say finger her a little...) but then your friend who is strategically hidden in the room sneaks in and inserts himself as if it were you....this is when you quietly exit the room, reappearing outside the window when you now (smiling ear to ear) wave at your girl, who comes to the realization that, ""if you he is out there, who is fucking me!!!?""....hillarity ensues
&gt; 
&gt; 

Yeahhhh unless GF has already given permission for said friend to touch / be intimate with her, I'm gonna go ahead and call that straight up rape."
"Hanging out with someone I don't trust, alone, after I specifically asked you not to, and then hiding it from me. "
"I got downvoted in the childfree sub for saying that stay at home mothers are not akin to adult children and they contribute to the household in significant ways, albeit performing unpaid work. People were arguing ""if you don't earn money to support yourself and are dependent on your spouse, you're basically an adult child and a lazy worthless human being"".

I was extremely confused at how not one but numerous people could come to that conclusion. "
"Same here. My husband actually announces his pooping. Even if my family is around.

I need a looked door and everyone away from the door to be comfortable. I HATE my in-laws house. Super thin walls and a two-inch gap under the door means nothing is private. I usually time my shower to coincide with the poop schedule. "
"My uncle gave my cousins goodnight handshakes. My aunt was very affectionate at least, but still. "
"In all honestly, we had that ""honeymoon period"" of a new relationship and just never left it"
You sound like you need better friends.
"Mostly annoyed. Like have sex if you want, but you need to respect that there are other people in the house. Keep it down"
Not OP but I highly doubt it was administered by the school. Probably just a thing the students were doing amongst themselves.
"I was unemployed for about six months, and in that tine, I applied for over 300 jobs. It sucks. I can't even describe the feeling. I definitely settled for things I wouldn't have applied to otherwise. But the way I finally got a job was through one of the temp agencies I used. That got me some money and a job, and I got my next job like three months after that one had closed. 

Definitely try to keep busy. I'm so sorry you're going through this!"
"My MIL asked during a game ""What does this one mean?"" and held up the ""pixelated bukkake"" card. My wife struggled to explain bukkake while still keeping the language... clean-ish. MIL sits there for a second, and then just said ""Yeah, but what does pixelated mean?"" The look on Wife's face when she realized that her mom already knew what bukkake meant was priceless."
You couldn’t get a full refund even after all of that? Airbnb really need to get their shit together.
We fuck a lot.
"Egregious misconceptions about female anatomy are my favorite. 
Like men who think that tampons are for urine, and that the uterus/bladder are the same thing. I’ve seen an unfortunate number of men confused why tampons would ever be free/not taxed, with questions like “if you can’t hold your bladder why should I have to pay for it?!” 
🙄"
"-Physical health: Exercising and eating better


-Working on strategies for my mental health


-making more of a point to socialize and make connections in life"
Convinced myself there is no such thing. I am unsure if that person exists. What a lonely world through my eyes.
"All the little surprise gifts that I keep for him. When he feels down, I just have to leave one on his pillow, or in his pocket. 

In fact, he was the one to start it and I found it so comforting that I began to copy him. "
Are you a third rate duelist with a fourth rate deck?
"McDonald's Bacon &amp; Egg McMuffins. 

My father was a shift worker, and he'd often get home around 5am. I saw him but rarely, so I'd often wake up long before school started to try and get a few minutes of quality time. On occasion, he'd bring me an Egg McMuffin as a treat. 

We no longer speak for various reasons, but those cheap, crappy little breakfast sandwiches make me feel like home. "
"I prefer to substitute ""I'm working through some stuff right now but I'd like some time to think about it.""  We're adults, we should be able to trust each other to communicate when it's needed."
"Getting into bed after a shower. Or waking up in the morning, showering and then lounging around the house on the weekend.
I also loooove the feeling of qtips in my ear. I know it’s super bad for you but it just feels so good, total eargasm!

Your Song by Elton John. I get teary-eyed everytime I hear it. It's pathetic.

I really enjoy putting half of one finger in my pockets
My dad would have told my mom that she needs to spend more money in that case or that she's being ripped off.
I've been very much enjoying that my new roommate isn't around very often. 
"He’s super clingy and I need my space. We clashed over it a few times, but we seem to have it figured out now. My job is depressing (I work in animal shelter medicine), physically harder than his, and a bit mentally more challenging than his. Sometimes I come home at the end of the day beat down and depressed, and I just need my space for a bit to unwind and gather my thoughts. He understands now that it’s me and not him, and now he lets me be for an hour or so in the evening when I come home, it’s all about compromise."
"Wow. She's clearly in the wrong line of work.

"
"I wouldn't say ""invalidates"" but yes, my period affects my emotions, and keeping track of my cycle is part of my mental health self-care. 

For me, 2-3 days before my period I will just start feeling really depressed. I feel like I'm bad at my job, a bad friend/family member, don't have my shit together, etc. When I then check my period tracker and see ""Oh, hey, my period is due soon,"" I can put those feelings in perspective. I realize that no, I'm not actually a garbage person, it's just the 2-3 days per month I am particularly susceptible to thinking I am a garbage person. 

Back when I was young and dumb, I tripped on psychedelics a couple of times. Before my first trip, my more-experienced friend told me to remember I was on drugs, and use that as a framing device for my experiences mid-trip. That is, if I think Barack Obama is watching me from the tapestry on my wall (for instance...) I can say ""Oh, hey, remember, you're on drugs!"" and that reminds me that while what I'm experiencing may feel true, it isn't really. 

Basically I apply that same theory to my pre-menstrual depression. "
"Same. My dad explained it to me (his daughter, early 20s) during a game of Cards Against Humanity.

It was awkward."
"Agreed, as long as it’s not constantly at inappropriate times. Like 3am on a Tuesday. And then again on Wednesday. And probably Thursday. Don’t wake me up cuz ya drunk and horny!"
Grass types represent!
"Holding hands.   Or is that a common thing people count as cheating?  He's very anti-touch with most everyone so it'd sting especially hard. 


It's just so intimate, I'd be fairly upset if he did that with another woman. (The sex that he is attracted to)


I don't think it's a break-up worthy offense, but I'd be very hurt and we'd have to have a talk about it. "
"I went to an all girls' school. We weren't allowed to wear coloured underwear, it had to be white. They used to check our pants when we got changed for sports, but that stopped a few years after I joined. Then it was just bras that they policed. Their reasoning? Apparently male teachers could get distracted if they saw our bras through our school shirts. Grown men in positions of responsibility were potentially looking at teenage girls' breasts, but it was our responsibility to make sure we stopped this happening. "
"Work. Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that's why I shit on company time."
"&gt; only the prettiest girls get raped.

What the actual fuck? How did that therapist have a license??"
They make scented tampons? That sounds like a recipe for a bad time.

"My dad was a huge (6'5"", 300+lbs) Texan who looked like your average biker dude. Man fucking loved girly drinks. The girlier, the better.

We would be on an out of town trip (I worked as a mechanic for his specialty machine install/repair/maintenance business for all of my teens and into my 20's), and hit a bar after work together. I can't tell you the number of times they tried to give me his fruti-tuti pink swizzle straw with whipped cream topping drink and give him the beer I ordered. For reference, I am a petite 5'3"" woman.

He would laugh and give me my beer while sipping on his frou-frou drink.

I miss that man more than I can say. Now, my husband (6'8"" police officer) will occasionally order a frou-frou drink in his honor. "
"&gt; I thought American girls were all skilled in the dark arts of hair styling

Lols I do work five min from home and no I don’t go home and poop. I go home at lunch and sometimes poop then? But otherwise ya I use the toilet at work. By the time you drive home poop and come back that’s like a 20 min poop break god damn that’s commitment.
