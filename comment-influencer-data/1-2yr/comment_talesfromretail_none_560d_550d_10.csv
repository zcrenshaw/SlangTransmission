I'm kinda worried about that girl. If her mother won't even take her daughter to go to the bathroom even when she's in distress then it's not looking up for her.
Gotta love it when people think closing time doesn't apply to them.
"I love people who claim..""well other stores do it...""

We get that issue with couponers. ""We only have problems with coupons at this store(even same company)."" We follow coupon policy to a T and restrict things within our company policy as stated in our policies. Other stores close to us don't and let couponers have free reign. They always get huffy with us about it.. ""But the store down the street does it for us."" My thoughts is why aren't they going to that store then??? A cashier I know is friends with one and her friends response? Other couponers already wiped that store out of the product. 

Angry couponers or Angry customers that we don't have a sale item in stock for them? I'd rather have angry couponers. No one needs 50 bottles of Dawn dish soap every week."
"And the best part of it is that when little kids say things like this, they really mean them! They haven't learned to lie to make others happy yet, so if that little girl thought you were beautiful, you must be beautiful OP!"
"I don‚Äôt know, I attributed it to the fact that the lady was older (gray hair), my coworker is mid 40s and I‚Äôm in my 20s (Ive been told I look 16 though). I figured the lady accepted that my coworker knew what she was talking about compared to me. "
"At my job, we have prices that are either like $2 even, or $2.50. And we don‚Äôt charge tax. So you‚Äôd think that addition would be easy for the customers. Ooh boy, it‚Äôs not. "
My shoplifters just stick bottles of wine in their pants and walk out like it's nothing.
"I've been a frequent peer all my life, and once my mom kept getting mad at me for needing to stop constantly that I tried to hold it longer. I peed myself, and my mom got mad at me for that too.

It's one of the worst feelings in the world."
"Actually, Canada doesn‚Äôt use pennies anymore. They phased them out a few years ago."
People always seem to make $100 worth of fuss over $2 worth of coupon. 
"What, you didn't know that ""uh huh"" means, ""no, dummy, I meant the strawberry one""?"
"Buying strangers a pet?! Deciding wether a child is responsible enough or if the household is even interested in having a pet to take care of, should definitely not be a decision made by some crazy lady who thinks wrapping up living animals in a jar like jelly beans is a cute fun gift idea. "
"No, customer is a moron."
I mean id work 30min longer for $40 no problem. 
"I would be livid if someone sent home a living creature with my kid!

ETA: or in this case, probably dead. "
Ouch!  The worst I've done is cracked an egg into the garbage and thrown the shell into the frying pan.
"&gt; No one needs 50 bottles of Dawn dish soap every week.

I used to watch those extreme coupon shows, and there were people who bought sheds to keep all their ""hauls"" in. What the hell are you going to do with 200 boxes of cereal? 150 tubes of toothpaste?

The only ones I could understand were the ones who did it to donate their hauls. The rest of the people just seemed like organized hoarders to me. I stock up when stuff goes on sale, sure. But my ""haul"" fits in my pantry."
Also that throwing more money at the situation will make us stay open later or something.
Except knowing some customers they‚Äôd be like ‚ÄúI know I said $40 but all I have on me is a $5‚Äù
"No, customer is trying to get free stuff and thinks she can intimidate the kid into getting it. When someone else comes along, she gives up. "

"Omg I hate that! I have baby chicks. DO YOUR RESEARCH! I get all mine on nipple feeders after the first week. Water troughs are so messy. Baby chicks are messy though in reality. I used to work at a pet store and ppl would always bring fish or hamsters back dead and when we asked about it, they put goldfish in with tropical or added 10 fish at once to a small tank or had a hamster with a guinea pig. And we had to ask extensive questions when selling animals but ppl would lie and what can we do about that? Nothing. And yes returns were made bc .... retail. I feel your pain. "
"Ah, I wish more employees that could use that line: ""This is not for children and you are acting like a child right now.""  /talk to the hand"
They held it for about 20mins. For 20mins the mother ignored her child who need to use the restroom. What a bitch mom.
She‚Äôs a kid why didn‚Äôt her mom just walk her over to the other store to use the bathroom. It would have taken what 5 mins? Kids can only hold it so long 
"I once accidentally scanned an item twice, then voided the second scan. At that time, receipts printed exactly how all items were entered, removed etc. So on the receipt, it showed:

$4.35

$4.35

-$4.35

The couple shopping insisted that I had charged them three times for the item. I tried to explain that I put it in twice then removed it once.
""No, $4.35 is on here three times!"" I pointed to the minus sign in front of the third.
""But it's on here three times!"" So I tried the 2-1=1 approach. That didn't work. Supervisor finally had to take over the math lesson. You'd think two grown adults would be able to figure out something so simple."
If they were that important to her she'd have canned her own damn cherries.  And if she was that great of a cook she would be looking for fresh fruit for whatever recipe.  
"""What type of store sells things to *multiple customers at one time*?!"""
"He got de whole world, in his pants..."
"It's little things like this that have kept me in retail. The thing is, that 85% of customers are run of the mill, boring transactions you forget in a second.
14% are the tragic bastards we read about on here most of the time.

But that golden one percent like this guy, they are what keep me in the job."
"""What can I get for my troubles?""

The fuck out. "
"Same! At another store, they greenlit the sale of thirty or so betta fish for a wedding. They put them in vase centerpieces at each table, with the idea of sending lucky guests home with one. Well, the majority of the guests didn't want them, and rather than return them to the store, the customers dumped them in a ruddy creek behind a popular strip mall. Which just... haunts me. "
Dude failed his Persuasion check pretty badly...
"We've had an influx of these people recently. I think it was Read Across America or something in schools this or last week? And every other teacher thinks it would be oh-so-cute if they surprised the children after a read aloud of Red Fish, Blue Fish with their own miserable mason jar prisoner. "
"Yeah they‚Äôd deal with it alright‚Äî by making it free, making you apologize, and giving the guy a $20 gift card. "
"Your supervisor sounds like a bit of an ass.  I mean sure, company policy may be no replacements period, but to basically laugh at the guy for making a mistake?  Really?"
"If only she knew that someone else may have done exactly the same thing with the 'new' one she chose. I wonder if it would shatter her hold on reality, and plunge her into a world of chaos and destruction."
"&gt;Lady: Well I understood it like that so you are legally obliged to give me the discount.


&gt;Lady: But you are legally obliged to give me this discount because that's how I interpreted it.

What the fork!? Did she learn ""legally obliged"" at the law of idiots school?"
I was distracted making simple mac-and-cheese once; I emptied the cheese packet into the boiling water and saved the dry noodles for... later?
Wait wait wait wait wait so you actually got her to pay 25p MORE for each plant? That‚Äôs priceless! I would have been all smug and smiles at that woman as she left knowing I accomplished that üòÇ
"The customer changed her mind and didn't want to be seen as wrong, so she blamed you.  Like any 5 year old will do."
Everything has to be perfect for my one-year old's birthday that they'll never remember or care about!!
"Kink 101, people. Don't involve other people in your play without prior consent."
That is flat out abuse. That poor child. 
"I love how unfiltered kids are. They are either super sweet like that or unintentionally mean, either way it‚Äôs adorable. "
So there‚Äôs good fishy taste and bad fishy taste. Good fishy taste and smell is made by good fish. Bad fishy taste and smell is made by bad fish. There‚Äôs no way to describe it other than ‚Äúthis is too fishy‚Äù or just fishy. It means it tasted the way your cousin dans fucking aquarium smells after he found weed for the first time and started neglecting his gold fish. 
"The charity event organizers needed to be notified that their patrons were vandalizing your store.   Their behavior was completely unacceptable.
