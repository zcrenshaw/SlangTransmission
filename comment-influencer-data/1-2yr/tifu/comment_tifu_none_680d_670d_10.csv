Maybe next time you could just put his stapler in some jello.
"Get a little cop car toy and some mini police tape, and warden off his keyboard/mouse on the anniversary of the prank"
That’s what Guy Fieri would call a trip to flavor town
"TIFU, now with cringeworthy proof. "
"LMFAO. Oh wow, so many props for posting that video. Thank you!"
Have you kissed her while he wasn't looking? 
Genuinely curious. Were you skipping vegetables and food high in fiber on purpose during this whole time?
"Well, this is morbidly hilarious. Good lucky OP."
"&gt; TIFU by kissing my best friends wife while he saw it.

FTFY TIFU by kissing my best friends wife ~~while he saw it~~."
That’s gnarly. 
Least useful TL;DR ever. 
I'm in my mid 30's and just realized I am lactose intolerant. Still unsure if I developed it later in life or was just in denial. 
"A tense situation to be in.  I might have waited until the officer came to my vehicle, keep my hands up &amp; explain that the drivers window doesn't go down &amp; ask what they would like me to do.  "
"&gt;A little auto-fellatio never hurt anybody.

You appear to have been mistaken.
"
I know I was expecting to read something about like a friendly kiss on the cheek that was misunderstood by the husband or something not a full on make out with your best friends wife story. 
The Office LPT: Place a coin inside his handset every two weeks. After 6 months simply remove all coins. 
"I'm gonna be a bit more blunt and say you're a real piece of shit. You definitely left out all the details of the evening that led up to that point as well as whatever context there was before you kissed her because you have been scheming to do this for a while. You didn't just randomly hug your best friends wife (""like people in our friend group do,"" who do you think you're fucking kidding?) and then can't figure out who kissed who. You already fucked up both of their lives. Do everyone a favor and leave them alone if you actually care about them or just nut up and embrace the fact you act like a borderline sociopath and continue trying to steal your best friend's wife. "
"Yeah, I don't monitor my fiber intake or take any steps to supplement my intake, but I don't have this problem. I feel like it still indicates something wrong. But I'm no doctor."
Well said. The world would be a better place if everyone had a friend like you. 
“TIFU by getting hammered at work”
"""I probably spent like 20 minutes out there in my drunken state, smearing diarrhea around the balcony.""

I can fix this... I can fix this... "
Probably not much. They're going through a lot of pane right now. 
"Maybe instead of jumping right to fiber supplements, you should just try for a balanced diet."
Or he could put him in custardy.
I wouldnt characterize $160 fine as aggressive for puking all over someone's car. The smell + the effort to get it out is probably worth a higher fine than that.
"Seriously. OPs just an ass hole. But at the same time could have brought to light that his friends wife may not be as faithful as she let on. Because it’s not just him who made out with someone’s wife while the husbands ten feet away, it’s a wife who made out with some while her husband was right there."
"I'm going to go ahead and advise you to go to the doctor to test for hepatitis.  Hepatitis Viruses can live on hard surfaces for up to 8 hours, so it's possible you could have been exposed.  Also might want to get a tetanus shot, even if the knife wasn't rusty, there can still be risks (rusk doesn't necessarily increase the risk for tetanus, it simply implies that the object has been around in the elements long enough to have tetanus growing on it)"
"This. I have seen enough episodes of Cops to know that, any time you get pulled over, it's always best to keep your hands on your steering wheel and allow the officer to direct you what to do. If you have to reach for something(license/registration) you first tell the cop where you're going to be reaching, and for what, and then do so slowly."
"You probably ruined the life of your ""best friend"". I honestly can't see him trusting anyone anytime soon.

I mean, you would've thought that a wife and a ""best friend"" would be people that you would trust without second thoughts.

In one day you are having fun at home with a group of friends, and the next you have no wife, no ""best friend"" and most likely some severe trusting issues. 

If the story is true, I actually feel bad for the guy."
"They will absolutely replace these. They'll have contingency plans for reissuance in case of lost or damaged mail, and your request will be routed exactly the same as one of those requests would be."
You left out one important detail. Did you tell the doctor how it happened?
"I have to say, marketing jewelry with a toothbrush and scratch-offs is one hell of a way to confuse people into bad decisions. 

"
"I love that the teacher comes up pats on you on the back like ""kiddo you just fucked up but its okay dont worry"" props to him for not going off on you."
You lose lactose tolerance over time so it just got worse until you noticed it probably
Totally tubular 
Bring on the downvotes but what the hell? The guy plays a couple minor office pranks and you make him think he's being arrested? Counter pranks are welcome but this escalated far beyond what the first guy was doing
Don't they have door bells?
"""So I *arrive* while I'm removing the knife""

My friend, I think you just discovered your fetish. "
"It's cool, if you were then OP wouldn't listen to you. "
The video is the best part 
"Wow!  While the video is hysterical, pretty sure that trophy cost less to put together than this comment. It should be back in no time. 
Bold post. Well done. 

p.s.  What’s with the jerk trying to steal your falling thunder?"
"More tips from The Office:

Replace his writing instruments with crayons

Stare at his forehead for no reason

Convince him he is turning into a vampire

Convince him he is a robot

Add keys to his key ring gradually until he has a ridiculous amount of keys

"If it's any consolation OP, you seem like a humorous dude and if your crush doesn't appreciate that, then find someone who will "
Did that on Tuesday. Thanks for looking out. 
"He sprayed homemade hydrochloric acid mixed in with decaying food matter in someone's $20,000 plus work vehicle. "
"That video actually made me cover my mouth with my hand, squinch my eyes, and mouth, ""Oh, fuck""

Unless he's the type of person that will try to kiss your wife.
Lifting a heavy object improperly. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Fuck me that is brutal, remind me never to annoy you at work."
"They’re worthless as friends if they think it’s okay to do that. The blame’s on both, not just one or the other"
good question
Haha actually that's our principal and ya props to him for not chewing me out
"I mean, how the hell do you *avoid* eating fiber? Any moderately balanced diet will have lots of fiber on it, what the actual fuck OP."
"So your family was preparing to head back to the cars and they didn’t think to check that you might have started walking down that way already? 
Seems like this is more their fault than yours."
"I'd just leave the friend alone.  Chances are that friendship is over now.  Leave him alone.  


I feel bad for the husband. "
This should be so much higher up. This is just completely the best idea [6]
That's blood in your ears behind the drum. See a doctor immediately.
I know a kid in New Jersey that broke his neck trying to suck his own dick? 
"This is my worst fear with my 3 year old. She's a flight risk at any moment right now, including mid tooth brushing. "
"Dude, you stuck your dick in crazy.  You got a little bit stabbed, but it sounds like you dodged a bullet overall, she sounds crazy AF."
"Buckle up because we are hitting up the hottest places serving up the finest turds right here on triple D: Dookies, diarrhea, and Dumps"
Seems as though you pulled a Winston (from New Girl) where his pranks are either basically nothing or WAY overboard
If it's awkward or it gets brought up just explain to him you only said that to make your brother shut up because he kept waking you up in the middle of the night.
"Or locked doors? At least the front door would be locked, to prevent strangers from wandering in."
Did it taste more like poodle or bloodhound shit? Big dogs are renowned for their subtle floral notes. 
"Yikes!!  That's a lot of water.  And it reminds me of a similar incident in my family.   

When I was maybe 10, I was at my dad's one summer, and he lived in a mobile home with my stepmom, and her kids.  So one afternoon he shouts out for us kids to get ready, we're going to see a movie.  So 5 kids pile into the car and we make the 30 minute drive to the nearest theater...I forget what we saw.  We start the return trip home and my stepsister says something about the bath she'd started and wasn't sure if she turned it off... My Dad gunned it.    

There was about 4 feet of water in the tiny bathroom, and the two adjoining bedrooms had soaked carpet before we even opened the door.  It took my dad all summer to rip apart that bathroom floor and replace it."
"Don't worry, I'm sure the kids in school will all soon forget about this instance, especially now that it's making it's way around the internet. ^^^^RIP ^^^^OP"
"Look, I know you want to fix this and feel better, but right now you need to stop thinkig about yourself and start thinking about your friend who is in the shit because of your actions. I only say it this way because I've been on the receiving end of this exact situation, and your self pity isnt helping your friend at all. Look critically at yourself and CHANGE what needs to be fixed so you aren't a shitty friend ever again. THAT'S how you make this better. Your friend may forgive you one day, and if he does you need to do everything in your power to do right by him. I made the mistake of forgiving my best friend for what he did to me and all he did was use that as an excuse to absolve himself of guilt and then ghosted me. Dont be that guy."
"It’s normal to hug someone goodbye, then start making out with them after right?"
"“Ok kids lets go back to the car”

“Have you seen dave?”

“No maybe he went to the car”

“NO THAT SON OF A BITCH WENT BACK TO THE SKI SLOPE, GET 4 OF EVERY FUCKING THING 911 CAN SEND TO US FAST”"
"If anything, this TIFU makes the whole situation better. By breaking some trophies they gained full blown Reddit attention."
 It seemed to be a natural thing for them to kiss from how the story goes. 
"I just like how his first instinct is ""GRAB THE GUN"" and shoots him"
Ya he's my friend. We're both long time reddit users
"Yup, it worked out well. Hoping to see her again tonight. "
"Also, you might want to check and see if you body still has a soul. I think you sexed a succubus. "
"Funny story to make you feel a little better about this FU:

A few years ago, my wife and I were looking at homes to purchase. Our realtor brought us to this house that had just been renovated. It was the dead of winter so snow and ice was everywhere. The realtor of the house meets us to unlock the front door.

She unlocks the door, walks in a little bit, then starts running towards the kitchen. We hear a loud, ""FUCK!"" then she's sprinting up the stairs then charges down the stairs on the phone yelling at someone.

Come to find out, the entire kitchen was completely flooded. Water is raining down from the ceiling. We head down to the basement and see that the entire floor of the basement is flooded, leaking out to the garage and then down the driveway where it froze solid. The ceiling of the basement had water flowing down the walls and dripping water from the kitchen above. We head to the top floor and find where the water came from.

Some jackass left the sink on full but didn't think to unstop the drain, which caused the flooding. It's common practice in our area to let sinks run if its particularly cold out and there's nobody there. The person who left the sink on, forgot to unstop the sink and the whole house flooded for 3 days. Needless to say, that house came off the market for a good 6 months before it came back on. I'm sure the contractor/home flipper was furious that they fucked up their sale."
"Good news is in 5 years it will be just another funny story that you have absolutely no time to care about. And in 10 years, it's gone completely."

"Yep. The correct response IF your friend's wife starts making out with you is to back off and give a good ""WTF are you doing??"" The correct response if you start making out with your friends wife is to reevaluate  what kind of person you are. "
Aww I don't know him personally but I'm sure he wasn't trying to be mean. Just having a laugh with some of his friends.
"For a second I read that as ""Half Asian, half Japanese"""
"I had a friend who recounted that one day while he was driving, his whole body started going numb. He had to pull over and get an ambulance before he completely passed out. When he was taken to the hospital they informed him he had a blood clot somewhere (close to the liver) in his midsection. They said it could have been fatal and that this sort of thing would happen if he had spent alot of time in an extreme position. He told them that he spent alot of time hunched over at work and they gave him some meds and he went on his way. He told me this story days after it happened and in casual conversation. After he left my ex girlfriend said ""you know, he jokes about sucking his own dick, what if..."". The next time I saw him I called him on it and he sheepishly admitted that he had indeed managed to get his own dick in his mouth and he had been spending copious amount of time fallatiating himself. I dont know if he told the docs the truth but I will never forget that look of shame and worry when he admitted that not only had he been sucking his own cock but that it could have been lethal.
Tl;dr- friend sucked his own dick and ended up in the hospital. Rectum? Damn near killed 'im!"
Tuubulaaaaar
"""Wow! I would have never known my wife was shitty without you, you're my best friend bro!"" Nah that's not an out for him. Thanks for sharing OP, but you dun goofed."

"I experienced something similar with a package of chicken scraps from the butcher which unknowing had been left in the trunk of the family car.  We first started noticing a smell from the car and by the when we finally discovered the rotting chicken in the trunk, the smell was overpowering.  The scraps were intended to feed local wildlife (our backyard was surrounded by forest) but were overlooked when we unloaded groceries.

I'm still sensitive to the smell of old chicken even decades later."
"u/theVulgarity I'm sorry, but there is no fixing this. You just nuked your relationship with them (and theirs) from orbit and there is no going back. You do not do that to people you care about.

The best course of action for you now is to delete their numbers and focus on learning how to treat others as you wish to be treated. "
"911 operators here. You just described most missing child calls. As soon as the kid can’t be found, they call 911. This is before they check the common places a kid might be. Most of those calls the kid is found while I’m still on the phone. Most people don’t realize that a missing child call is one of the few call types that will get every single available unit headed to the call. As soon as I enter the call, you’re going to have a dozen patrol cars headed your direction as quickly as they safely can. The sergeant will likely ask for air support and there’s a good chance we might ask nearby other jurisdictions to give us a hand with whatever resources they can spare.

If you can’t find your kid, spend 2 or 3 minutes checking common sense places (under tables/beds, in closets, etc) as well as other places they can likely fit themselves, depending on age (dryers, cabinets, bathtub between couch and wall, etc). In this case, common sense was, kid knows we’re going to the car soon, I should check the car. Sucks he got an ass whooping because his parents lacked common sense."

Years ago when living in a small one room + bathroom apartment on the first floor I woke up from noise in the kitchen area. Afters freaking out for one or two seconds my sleepy naked ass decided it was best to run into the kitchen area while waving my arms and screaming bloody murder.

This freaked out the intruder.

The intruder (turned out to be a junkie) was so startled that he turned around and tried to escape as fast as he could. He jumped over the balcony railing and broke his arm and scratched his face on landing.

The day after I arranged with the police (police station was a 5 min walk away; they all thought it was hilarious) to visit him in the hospital and gave him a card and told him he's a dick-head for scaring people.

tl;dr; Had a junkie break in to my apartment. Ended up visiting him in the hospital.
