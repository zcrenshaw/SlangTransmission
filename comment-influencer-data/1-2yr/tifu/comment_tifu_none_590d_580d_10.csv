"What's with people on Reddit saving up their stuff? I've always believed in destroying the evidence asap. 

Edit: Wow this blew up, RIP my cumbox."
"This is like the fourth story I've read now where you fuckers are just jizzing in some random place with reckless abandon.


What the fuck is wrong with you people? Do you think it just disappears into the cum dimension once you fall asleep? "
Update us on that exam score OP. 
"Until ""covered my lady parts"" i assumed you were a guy...
The part with your mum massaging you sounds less awkward now."

Fuck. Glad you didn't bite your tongue off.

Worst part of this entire story."
This is actually a recurring nightmare that I have. Yikes. Good luck!
"Bun in the oven - super common, easily understood

Literal hamburger bun in the oven at 6 AM - wtf is happening, why am I not asleep, I have no clue what this is supposed to mean

EDIT: Gold thanks the for stranger kind"
Been 3 hours. OP is ded.
"My dad used something similar to prank me when I was about 12 years old. Except instead of random sounds these cycled through things like ghostly whispers, someone screaming, and so on. You get the idea. And they went off about once an hour. 

He put them in my room and I became convinced my house was haunted, but he kept saying I was imagining things. What made it worse was that when I wasn't home he would switch the locations of them so I could never pinpoint where it was coming from. He finally admitted it to me when one of the noises scared me shitless, but not before nearly dying of laughter.

Needless to say he gave them to me afterwards and I stuck them under the seats of his car in spots where only a 12 year olds arms could reach."
"Looking forward to the ""TIFU by using my student loans to go on a last-minute trip with my friends"" thread."
"What? A bedroom door that locks from the outside? Did your parents not understand which way round to put he lock and inadvertently create a fire death trap, or did they just keep you locked up sometimes?


[Edit: for any parent considering reversing a lock, check this out first. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MXBLOSG/ They can be opened from either side by anyone tall enough to reach the top of the door. Perfect to keep the kids away from the Tide Pods!]"

Me too.
She knew.
"When I was 8 Or so, I went with my mom to a business trip in Scotland. She got the bright idea to talk up ghosts and the haunted buildings in town. Then, she bought a bagpipe fridge magnet that played Scotland the brave and turned it on every time I went to the bathroom. She denied ever hearing it and had me go down and ask the hotel manager if any pipist had ever died in that bathroom.  I was a dumb kid."
"Once crammed 12 weeks of electrical theory and equations into 2 nights.

I failed."
"Part of me feels like that story ended a little too soon. I would expect one of two endings:

A) My parents, being reasonable parents, saw to my wounds and, in appreciation of the injury and loss I incurred by appeasing my sister, assured me that I would no longer be expected to let her play with my stuff.

B) My parents, being typical story parents, yelled at me for getting blood on the doorframe and for bullying my sister. I fear the last thing I shall ever see is her smile as I am startled awake as she snaps my neck."
Hey at least now you know the worst thing that could happen to you at the gym has happened and you shouldn’t feel scared to go back - woohoo silver lining!
"I laughed, I cried, I pitied your big armed father."
Probably hoping the semen fairy shows up to clean it up.
"Senior year of college I skipped my classic literature course so often that I didn’t realize I read the wrong book for the final. The assignment (and what we presumably spent months discussing in class) was Ovid’s Metamorphoses, a Roman epic poem. Instead, I read Kafka’s Metamorphosis, a 1915 novel about a man who one day wakes up as a giant bug. "
Former owner of the house was probably terrifying.
"Dude...what the fuck. Who just shoots off onto their wall for a year and doesn't think to ever clean it up? Also, if your mom knew  and kept cleaning it, instead of making you do it, I think that's just as odd. I would have loved to hear what she was thinking during all of this"
"There was a similar post about a year ago, one of the top comments was ""WTF, do you just shit in bed and kick it out with your feet?"". I still chuckle when I picture that."
not even a happy ending and still a sore neck... rip off.
"This probably would not be as funny if you were dead, but you aren't so it's hilarious."
"I read a post a year or so back that was super similar to this but he cleaned it himself. Mom having to clean it is way more terrifying.

But I mean come on guys it doesn't dissappear when you spurt into the carpet.

I use to dropped my used tissues down the cack of the bed and I'd have to fish the crusty balls out every week. I mean I understand the mentality of just cumming yourself to sleep and that entitles no energy for clean up, but ffs contain it. Even into a dirty article of clothing or your bedding is better than down the wall or in the carpet. "
"I taught geology labs in grad school and actually had to fill in one semester to teach a meteorology lab. I had a student who seemed really uncomfortable after a few weeks and she was very disinterested. I asked her one day what was wrong, and she explained that she enrolled in the class because she thought she would learn about meteorites... she was extremely disappointed to find out the class was about weather lol."
Oh yes she DEFINITELY knew...
After a long flight I normally feel like I've absorbed everybody on the flight's greasiness... Adding oil to the mix must feel really gross... Like being deepfried! 
"Wtf, your sister sounds like a psychopath. Is she more well adjusted now?"
"And store *the knob* in the oven too, so you'll have to reach in there and remove the dishes. "
"My reocurring nightmare is me waking up back in college, and going to a day in class where i have a bunch of exams and i didnt studied anything."
This isn't really a TIFU. More just a story about how your sister is a little shit.
"It's okay, I did something similar to my wife when she told me about our second kid. I was laying on the floor in the living room in my undershirt, belly hanging out, when she sent my 1 year old daughter in the living room wearing a ""big sister"" shirt. I was completely oblivious, because let's be honest, I never pay attention to my kid's clothes. So she had to literally tell me to read the shirt after 5 minutes of dropping hints, and then it finally dawned on me. I didn't swear, but it still made for a crappy video."
"Damn. Ice is fucking scary, walking on it even driving on it. Be happy you didn't get any serious head injuries."
"Man, a year of cum without cleaning has to smell like a lot. My roommate throw his tissues under the bed and after a couple of weeks it emits a stench that covers the (H)hole room.



"
Second this
"I went into a Thai massage place, on a high street, well lit up, really lovely inside. I was handed a menu, and there was maybe 10 - 15 options on it, each one ending with a blow job.  

You couldn't not have a blow job!  

Needless to say I stormed out of the place .... half an hour later, dying for a beer."
"I have a buddy in his mid 20s who had a thing for shooting his load at his wall.  Not just down the side either, this dude aimed high.  Figured nobody would ever see it and he'd just pretend it was a leak or some shit that made his wall all gross.  One day a couple of us are at his place and walk into his room for a second.  ""DUDE WHY IS THERE SO MUCH DRIED CUM ON YOUR WHOLE WALL?!""  He didn't even try to hide it once we called it out.  So gross."
"When my cat was a kitten she would routinely step in her own poop in the litter box and then come snuggle with me in the middle of the night. The first time I thought it was sooo sweet until I smelled the poop. I had at least a dozen late night kitten baths. Holding a kitten under a faucet while trying to minimize contact with the poop is not fun. 0/10 don’t recommend.

Edit: said poop demon https://i.imgur.com/rzxbX6G.jpg "
"I had a similar thing happen. I take violin lessons and I have been going to the same Russian teacher for the past 13 years. She started a tradition of giving her students Christmas gifts at the yearly Christmas concerts we play at. However, her gifts are not normal; rather, they are small and I feel as if she is just messing with us. The past few years she has bought us Christmas ornaments and figurines that play music, and there is a small plastic tab that you have to keep inside the figure or else it will sing songs and play repetitive, annoying loops of tunes indefinitely. Not only this, but they are now motion sensored and sing when it detects movement. I lost the tab before I even made it to my car, and had to listen to it the whole drive home. I took it home and buried it in my closet. Fast forward a month later I woke up at 4am to it still singing jingle fucking bells in my closet so I took that Santa Claus figure and threw his jolly ass into the woods."
"I read the whole thing and was oblivious. The whole time I knew if it were me, she would have put me on edge with all the unusual behavior. "
"For real, I wanna see how fast that boner went flaccid when he realized."
Had the same thing happen to me 7 years ago when I was skateboarding. It sucks and mouth injuries still make me cringe. Hope you get well soon!

"""Sir, we heard a woman screaming, 'choke me harder, daddy', what are you doing to your daughter, sir?"""
"FWIW, I think a video of a groggy dude yelling and gesturing to a hamburger bun while at full mast is a lot better than any typical ""pregnancy surprise announcement"" video. And of course you can still share the video with close friends for a laugh!

Congrats!"
Another person had the same experience but he's a dude and he received somewhat of a proper massage until the hand job started.
I believe in you! Do they bell curve? Keep your notes for next year!
Broken arms. That is all. 
"It's actually pretty funny. And maybe she shouldn't show the video to everyone, but I think you should hold onto it. Nothing in life goes as perfect as you see in the movies (or instagram). And I'd totally show baby once they get to teenage age!"
That was his slave room.
Someone needs a poop knife.
Guess what? Mine either but I never nutted on a wall for any period of time. Do it on your cat like a normal person. It’ll clean itself.

"As a side note: OP, your future wife might have been in ECON 301. You missed her."
"My mom is a licensed massage therapist, and I’m a guy. Most professional massage therapists know how to make their clients feel comfortable and adjust the towel or sheet to make it feel obvious you are covered, for your comfort and their own. I’ve gotten a few massages, including some from my mom, and none of them have ever seen my penis or butt, or made me feel awkward about being naked. A big reason you get naked is so the oils don’t get on your clothes. "
"All she had to do, was follow the damn train. "
"agreed, we need more

C) my sister continues to do stuff like this and I am slowly turning crazy"
Here's your dad's morning wood honey
"You've got an awesome mom. My dad's idea of a joke is to insult someone in a stupid voice and then snigger about it. He wins the joke if the other person gets mad, but angry if they don't just leave it as a joke."
Honestly I would drop kick my sister through a wall.
"One weekday after my siblings and I were at school, my mom went into the bathroom to take a shower, with my 2-year-old sister watching Sesame Street in the living room right next to the bathroom.  She didn't lock the door, if my sister wanted my mom, she could have walked right in.

My mom finishes her shower, towels off and wraps a towel around herself, and goes to open the bathroom door, and the doorknob falls off.  She's effectively stuck in the bathroom.  There's a window in the bathroom, it's 5 feet above the now slick shower, has a screen on it, is only about 12"" wide, and there's a 10' drop on the other side onto a rock garden.  If worst came to worst, I'm sure my mom would have climbed out the window wrapped in a towel, hoping to not slip in the shower on the bathroom side of the window, or break her ankle or cut up her foot on rocks on the outside side of the window.

First though, she tries to get my sister involved.  She called for my sister until she could see my sister through the holes where the now missing doorknob is.  She tells my sister to find the phone.  My sister looks all over for the cordless phone, sometimes coming back in front of the bathroom door (so at least my mom knows she's fine).  Eventually she finds the phone.  My mom was trying to decide if my sister could call my school's daycare (school was only a block away, my mom volunteered at the daycare, she knew the people there and could have had one of them come over or send their husbands over), or if my sister should call 911 (it wasn't really an emergency, but that was way fewer numbers).  Didn't matter, my sister couldn't figure out how to turn the phone on.

She was debating the next step, there was still the risky climb out the window option.  Or, she could send my sister to my friend's house next door, and hope the neighbor was home and came to investigate why my sister was out wandering the streets.  That had it's risks too, like she might go to the house on the other side which instead of having my friend's young mother and siblings in it, would have had my friend's elderly grandmother who only spoke Spanish and would not have known to whom my sister belonged.  Or she might have walked into the street (although, neighbors across the street would probably have investigated in that instance).  

Anyway, before she came up with a plan, she heard a knock on the door.  She started yelling like crazy.  The person out front came to the side of the house to better hear her.  Turns out it's my little sister's godmother.  She managed to get into the house, situated my sister with a snack in front of whatever show on PBS came on after Sesame Street, and she and my mom spent a while trying to free my mom from the bathroom.

It only took them a few hours."
I hate it when I break my teets
"well, when my dogs ""kick grass"", once in a while one of them will kick their own shit.. and it's like they stepped on burning nails made of glass... they freak out.

"Wow that's amazing, you must've been stumped why everyone kept complaining about work pressure while you got the book down in about 3 hours. The difference is about 600 pages."
"I read an almost identical post but his cum under the bed ended up creating a roach colony which he kept as pets and played with them until his dad called pest control. I kept telling myself it was fake, i hate roaches and just the mental image of somebody touching them and playing with them makes me feel very uncomfortable. Unfortunately i can't say that is the weirdest thing I've read on reddit."
"100%. How could it possibly get worse than doing the cartoonish swept off a treadmill thing. It's all smooth sailing from here, you can't possibly embarass yourself more, so have no fear!

"Judging by how these kinds of posts go on this sub: 

He'll likely ace the mid-term and pass his original class with flying colors right before the professor and the rest of the class give him a standing ovation and repay the entirely of his student loan.

Or he failed the midterm and the story was true. Either way. "
"My dad used to yell at us when he saw us doing this. He would tell us the story of his brother that fell off a curb a broke his teet and nose. 

I warn my kids, minus the yelling, so they do a semi-hand in the pockets. Plus, there pants are so tight, their cell gets warped from the pressure in the pockets. "
She Yada yada'ed over the best part. 
Perhaps the Juche gods saved the supreme leader.
She didn't say if there was a happy ending or not.
This seems very similar to how a Sim’s character dies
"A construction dude I know got in a fight with his client.

He was pissssed so before putting drywall on the walls he put smoke detectors INSIDE 4 different walls along with writing some creepy ""RedRum"" kind of note inside the walls.

If anyone has had a smoke detector die before they usually start beeping intermittantly after their 1 to 10 year life is over.

There were many trades working on this house and by the time they start beeping it would be near impossible to prove who did it.

Plus when you find where it is coming from, rip open the wall, fix the wall and think it is all over, the next wall would start beeping as soon as the battery dies.

One of the most brutal and costly things someone can do for revenge lol



Edit : Just want to say WOW! I know there are only like 170 upvotes but its one of my highest voted posts/comments ever.  Glad you guys like the story and I am sure you are all glad it didn't happen to you! Moral of the story - Don't piss off a vindictive contractor."

"Yeah, I'm really fortunate."
It's official r/tifu is too funny for working in an office. The awkward LOL was intense on this one..
Op used student loans to take a vacation and skip school. Came back and couldn’t even be bothered to make it to class on time. Couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to the class location. Sat in the back of the class where students are shown to do poorly. Had questions/concerns and waited until the VERY last minute to ask his prof thus discovering he’s been a fucking moron the whole time. OP is the epitome of what not to do in school.

She literally told him God is watching she damn well knew
"I called my husband into our room and said “apparently Long Island Iced Teas make a baby” and he said “seriously?!”. That was our first. 

“WHAT IN THE FRESH HELL IS THIS???” Me to my husband with our second. This was a birth control baby.

“God fucking damnit” Both of us with this baby. This was also a birth control baby. 

We are about 99% sure our life is a cosmic joke."
"If it makes you feel any better OP my wife kept calling my name to the bathroom to show me something and after the 3rd time I screamed back ""I don't care how big your poop is I'm not coming into the bathroom to look at it""
Surprise effectively ruined.  "
I forth this
"That's what I was thinking, but you'd be very surprised how many women I met in Thailand that had dicks. "
Yup. I graduated 5 years ago and still have these nightmares. 
I realised this as a grown man. It was difficult to look my mom directly in her eyes for a few months..
"A friend of mine has a flat that completely stinks of cum. Not sure if it's him or his flatmate, but I don't have the heart to bring it up. My friends and I refer to it as ""boy smell""."
"Honestly, I would smack the shit out og my sister for doing that. She has some proper issues. "
"Im an Engineer on ships, I get dirty alot, but the only times I feel truly disgusting are driving too long and flying. Well, and one time a sewage tank poppped."
I think the politically correct term is “sblackpeople” nowadays. 
"Yeah, if OP's mom is a licensed massage therapist getting one from their mom really wouldn't be weird irrespective of gender. An actual massage (by someone who knows how to work with their clients) isn't really sexual at all - just incredibly relaxing. 

Most of us use our professional skills to help out our families if we can, so it just makes sense that someone who makes a living giving massages would do the same."
I just wanna see the boner.
"The last thing you needed was the fire department showing up so you would have to explain that you caught your apartment on fire with tubbleware in your oven? Ya know, the people that know how to put out fires, and are used to people doing stupid things that cause fires..."

"My mom yelled down the stairs to my dad that she was pregnant with me. He was working on some wiring in the basement and ended up zapping himself. So, you know, at least it wasn’t that.

You kinda deserve it, grumpy.

Edit: Anyone else is welcome to use this idea too."

"Growing up, my parents never really gave me any 'sex talk' or whatever. Everything about sex was taboo given the religious environment I grew up in. I think that she wouldn't bring it up because she'd want to avoid the topic in general. In hindsight, I agree with you, she should have absolutely brought it up and made me clean it. "
I would also drop kick your sister through a wall.
"There is a blog entry where the girl masturbates with maggots and loves cockroaches and all that shit, and stuffs those nasties up her vagina. So yeah. Just playing with roaches ain't that bad.

"When I was around 10 i spent the night at a friends house for a sleep over. I woke up in the middle of the night needing the take a massive shit. Not wanting to wake anyone up I decided to use the basements washroom. So I sit down and get to business and damn was it impressive. Picture a baby's arm holding an apple. A real trophy. So I whipe and flush and this giant turd just spins around the bowl and refuses to go down. I flush again and same results. So I throw a bunch of toilet paper on the turd and push it down with my fingers as I flush and success it goes down the pipe. So i wash up and go back to bed. When I get up in the morning and walk downstairs I'm met with what appears to be a full teardown of the basement washroom. Friends dad has the bowl dismantled and is wearing a rubber glove up to his shoulder, on his hands and knees up to his shoulder in the pipe pulling shit and paper out. The floor is flooded and it stinks.
Later I would learn that tree roots had worked their way into the pipes and had severely damaged them. My poop was the straw that broke the camels back. "

"I had an elective junior year of highschool that read this book. After reading the whole book the teacher held a discussion on the book and asked what each student thought the author was trying to portray. After each answer he would say ""Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?"" then ask another student. After everyone had put in their idea he said ""Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?"" and then moved on to the next unit in the course. Never actually discussed the book, just went ""who the fuck knows"" and moved on."
"I have a horrible poop situation right now. I have a regular sized dog, two cats, and now a Chorkie. We set it up so that our regular sized dog can’t get on carpet or rooms with litter boxes. But the Chorkie is so tiny that he can go everywhere the cats go. We have done everything: got covered litter boxes with top entries, got gates the cats have to jump over...everything seemed good. 

My big cat isn’t crazy about the top entry litter box. If he decides he doesn’t suit him. He’ll shit on the floor. My other cat will try to cover it, causing it to roll around. Then the Chorkie comes, eats his fill, brings some to share with the big dog. It’s great. 

Edit: WOW. My top two comments are how much I hate Two and Half Men and how my dog treats my cats’ shit like ambrosia.

"I had a buddy in high school who had his neck beard battle station set up in his living room. There was a huge sticky black spot to the left of his chair, and everytime we went over to his house it seemed to get bigger.  It was strangely suspicious but it was his house after all so who were we to say anything?  Anyways, one day the squad went over to his house we walked in without knocking as we usually do, just in time to see him stand up turn to the left dick-in-hand and just BUST right in that same spot. Our suspicions were confirmed, and the worst part, he still continued to use that spot. Never cleaned it up or anything. "
"Whenever I read lady 'bits', it sounds very funny to me. As if, 8 of them will make a byte."
TIL Bed Bath and Beyond pays prisoners $7 per day to pack their shit. No wonder we have so many people in prison.
"Yea, if that was me and she said ""A bun in the oven"" I'd probably just say ""Yeah, I see there's a hamburger in the oven, why is it in the oven?  Did you make me a hamburger for breakfast?""  She'd literally have to say the words for me to grasp, especially that early.

"Seriously, I had to check the post date to make sure this wasn't some old post I had already read before because I remember someone else posting about doing pretty much exactly the same thing to their poor room's wall, and finding insects eating his cum months after. Its hard to understand how dudes can think the cum would just disappear when I'm someone who'd wipe clear water off a desk after a spill before it can evaporate. "
"Yeah but to be fair, a pregnancy announcement was expected from the title of the post. I'm the ""not morning person"" in my marriage and I totally would have had this exact same reaction if I were in the husband's shoes. "
"He probably makes asinine comments about girls who smell fishy, just for extra irony."
"She once chased a burglar out of the house with a bat when I was a kid, so maybe she thought she could do it again?"
his mum is the semen fairy
I will bitcoin the video 
Must really drive off potential female clientele.
Why do people do this????????? 
Dude was quietly thinking he's some bloody genius getting through the book that took his classmates ages to finish. 
Maybe he peed on the wall.
Shitting in your pants isn't a good idea either.
"""A 9 month deployment on the Bush"" is how I'm going to refer to childbirth from now on."
"You're supposed to put it on the bedside table or next to your pillow so you remember to take it out in the morning, not step on it accidentally when you wake up."
"Having had a little brother that was spoiled as bad as he could be, I can relate. If he tore up my stuff, it was my fault for letting him use it. If he tore up his stuff and I had similar, I had to let him use mine so he didn't throw a fit. More than once, I was woken up to being hit with a golf club (thankfully they were just toy ones, made of metal). One day, I had enough and knocked shit out of him and beat my older step-brother senseless (he was egging him on that day) and was sent to live with my dad for a few months until my step-dad calmed down. When I came home, a lot of my stuff was broken or missing.

My younger brother and I got along great after that. He listened to me better than our mom and his dad from then on. He comes to me for advice now.

Side note, step-dad had to live with me for several months last year due to health and had an emotional come apart and apologized for all kinds of stuff and said that I'm the only one of his boys that turned out alright."
Cat prosthetics aren't quite as advanced as human prosthetics just yet 
cum doesn't smell the same after a few days sitting somewhere. probably smelled like a bag of dead cats after a year. im calling bullshit on this story
"This is why I never focus too hard in class, better safe than sorry."
"I left one of these in the ceiling of our hut in Afghanistan. I tucked it on top of an I-beam, right as we were leaving and a new unit was coming in."
She also might not have trusted his ability to clean it properly since he is an idiot. 
This is mine too and it’s been 10 years since I graduated so I don’t know why I’m still dreaming about missing college classes but it’s definitely anxiety inducing 
"I was kinda expecting you to do it again, trapping the poor stranger inside too"
"You need a girlfriend, girlfriends nag and keep you safe lmao

That was a joke since I just discovered married men actually live longer."
"It's pretty easy to break down an interior door. I mean, it wouldn't be my first choice, but definitely preferable to being trapped in a room for three hours. Door jams can be glued back together..."
"Next time use baking soda instead of water. Never flour, that is another disaster waiting to happen but baking soda can put out most fires."
YES! THAT'S THE GUY
"Think Geek sells the Annoy-A-Tron, sounds like what the OP used."
"wow...i have had this exact same experience.. and yes, I am a lady.  I'm also a lesbian, but I was not planning for a 'sexy massage', so when I realized it was one (about the same point where the OP realized it), I was in no way turned on (although the masseuse was cute)... I was more ""oh shit... aaaahh, what do I do?'

OP was smarter than me, though... I didn't think to cover my lady bits, but when she went for that area, I just covered my bits with my hands and she got the message.  

I will say, though, the massage part was actually pretty good at the place I went to.  When she told me to turn over -- well, I'd been to Thai massage places, they usually do ask you to turn over and they do your shoulders and stuff... but my thought at that point was ""aw man, she didn't spend long enough on my back, should I say something or... oh shit, she's naked..."""
