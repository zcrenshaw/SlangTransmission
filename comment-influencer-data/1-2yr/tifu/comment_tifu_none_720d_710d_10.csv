I think the weirdest part of this is using another mans cock ring...  There is a reason why adult stores have a no return policy.
"I have to say that I'm glad that's how it turned out for you... when I got to the ""flickering candlelight"" I thought it was going to go very differently."
"I was for sure expecting ""I caught my wife cheating and my marine son is in jail for beating her side piece up"" 
"
You didnâ€™t fuck up.  You just have an awesome wife and the surprise didnâ€™t quite go as planned.
"Cock and balls go through the big hole together, then they go through the other holes separately.

"well played, both on prank and title.

used to do this with cardboard movie cutouts, buddies worked at theaters and would occasionally take them home, i got a Life Sized capt jack sparrow cutout, took it up to my sisters room and placed it directly infront of her door. scared the shit out of her on so much that my dad came out of his bedroom with baseball bat.

they are good pranks, but you pay for it later."
If I was your classmate you'd be my hero! I always loved getting random days off when I was in high school . Especially as early as second period. 
If you get insurance from work use it now and get your lungs and shit checked out. 
"damn, reading the title and the first line I thought this was going in a way more rapey direction."

"Honestly with the way TIFUs normally go I was expecting ""I told my wife I was repulsed by her and never wanted to have sex again, which led to a 2 hour shouting match, at which point I caved and admitted our son was outside. But when I tried to prove it by opening the door, he had gotten bored and walked away. Now my wife thinks I'm a liar and is filing for divorce and I can't find my son."""
I like this TIFU better. 
"He wasn't having a tantrum, he just wanted to go ***fast***"
"Especially after ""I waited for her to fall asleep"""
There must be a backdoor trick to solve this problem
I want to see what this clown looks like

I could not figure out how this was supposed to work from the picture alone.  After googling it I am in pain.
I thought I was getting a butt fuck TIFU but still pleased with the result.
"&gt;My roommate is a 6'2 black guy and I'm a 5'10 ginger 

Sounds like the makings of a great sitcom"
"Yeah I'm with this guy. Everyone here just wants some sort of drama. You did an awesome thing for your wife, and as a parent I know opportunities to for sexy times are a bit few and far between, but having your son who is in the armed forces come home for a bit is worth way more.

Good on you."
Something tells me that sprinkler system was broken long before you started messing with it. I doubt they'd stop school all day just because one head malfunctioned.
This should be covered by workman's comp whether he/she has insurance or not.
I probably would have reacted much the same. That sounds fucking terrifying.
"and ""I feel the need to express how terrified she is of this."""
Bomb threats are serious business. But I LOVED when someone called one in. So much time spent not being in class.
"I know this is probably too late to help but they sell special oils to take the wax off. Some wax kits come with it. Also in my experience just let the pros do it. When it comes to lady parts best to leave it to a professional. 
But go to Sally's Beauty or even local drug store and you should find the proper oil to take it off your skin. Also use Bikini Zone cream after you wax and exfoliate a lot."
"I would've (and have in the past) just went home, grabbed wallet, and came back to pay for the stuff. Worst case scenario here is if you didn't return they'd just have to put all the stuff away. Bummer though OP, some people are shitty. 

They could've pursued charges on it which might've shed light on the truth, but it would've been a huge thing.

Edit: words."

"Right, but he's covered because he used oil that was placed in the ""suitable oil"" bin as per his own telling of the story. The mistake was made when that oil was placed there to be used for that purpose, not when he used it and therefore was presumably not made by him."
"Ah yes, this clears that up"
"""You do this twice a day,"" is the funniest thing you could have possibly said in that moment. ðŸ˜‚"
It's more like today I saved the school by getting its sprinkler system fixed
"Oh and to top it all off my employer owned the pager that was lost in this incident so I had to explain it to them and word got around and for the rest of my tenure there I got shit about ""trading my pager for some groceries"". At least reddit seems to understand that I was the real victim here"
"My father was incredibly afraid of giant plants, Ã  la Day of the Triffids variety. Didn't even like other large plants in real life. 

He was sleeping one morning and my mum snuck this huge sunflower plant into the bed beside him. 

When he woke up he screamed.  Like full-on, completely terrified, screamed. 

They're divorced now. Not saying there's necessarily a correlation but...  I don't think he ever really forgave her. "
"I'm so glad it isn't this, I had both versions in mind while I read this, and I've got too many trust issues as is. I'm glad it went as it did

"Given that you keep taking out more money on the loan to pay credit card debt, it sounds like the loan is a big problem actually.  You're continually living beyond your means, using credit cards to finance it, and then taking out loans to cover that.  Your financial life as it stands is not sustainable, and if you continue on in this vein you will end up in bankruptcy eventually.

Yes, you will need to work on regaining her trust, but you also need to put some serious effort into putting your financial house in order.  Part of what she's feeling is betrayal, and part of it is anxiety over being in a much worse financial position than she thought she was.  Both of these issues need fixing, and they both need fixing now.

Good luck.  As someone who accumulated a large amount of debt before learning to curtail spending, I know what a long and hard road you have ahead of you."
"May not be fay, but still pretty gay. "
Maybe there was another student sleeping too late who you woke up and saved their day.
"Guess I should've named him Sonic instead of Nick the Prick.

"Tried to wax myself recently.  Things were going okay... until I ended up bruising myself and taking off the first layer of skin.  I'd consider going to a professional except I don't like strange people around my nether regions, even if it is their job.

"One of my first jobs was a carpenters helper and laborer building homes. Slow days I would have to clean the houses...sweep, throw trash away, etc. In one of the houses someone had taken a nasty shit in the basement and wiped their ass with insulation... Usually I was cussing having to clean up after people but that made me laugh. Thinking about that guy waddling around for the rest of the day with an itchy asshole... You didn't shit in a basement in northern va in the early 90's did you OP?"
"My coworker previously worked at Pepsi as a driver. He had a stack of NASCAR driver cutouts that were taken down from a few grocery stores. I took five of them and hid them around my roommate's room. (Closet, back of door, outside his window, under covers, and in the corner of his room.) 

When he got home from a night of partying, he walked in, and immediately screamed from the one in the corner, turned on his lights, and yelled ""You fucker!"" This continued over the course of two days as he found the rest."

"Lmao! I made the same mistake at my favorite Thai restaurant. Always ordered it Thai hot and it was never enough until the day I told the owner ""I know I'm white but I'm not a pussy. I want the cook to be scared of it"". 

I was met with a blank stare then an evil creepy grin followed by the words ""OK. I'll tell him. It'll be done soon"".

As soon as I got the plate, the smell of the spices set my nasal passages on fire. I knew then I had made a mistake but my ego wouldn't let me back down.

Eating it was excruciating but it got done. A couple hours later after the feeling returned to my face, I thought I had won. However the worst was yet to come. 

The next morning I woke my roommate up from a deep sleep while I was in the bathroom with screams and pleas to the gods for mercy.

Now when I go into the restaurant they see me, grin and ask how hot I want it. ""Just regular hot please. I learned my lesson"" "

You must not be a parent. Kids are the biggest cock block ever. 
"We had two ""threats"" at my school. One was a kid from another high school making a joke on 4chan. Another was some kid in my school talking about hiding a bomb under a staircase in a video game. Some preppy girl heard him, thought he was weird, and reported him. He ended up being kicked out despite multiple witnesses providing context. 

Anyway, my school was set up with all of the academic buildings in one area, and a gym that was realllllly far away that you had to walk forever to get to. 

Both times during the threats, the entire school was evacuated to this gym. They would make an announcement about a surprise ""cold weather drill"" which isn't a thing. Then they'd send us all to wait in the gym. 

There were many problems with this. 

1. A cold weather drill? Really? The first time we had a threat it was -4 degrees and snowing. So even if this was a real thing, why would a cold weather drill involve walking OUTSIDE for a long ass time to go to the gym?

2. Whenever a threat occurred, parents would receive messages from the school informing them of the situation. When you have a bunch of bored high school kids with limited supervision in a gym, of course some of them will be on their phones. And parents panic, which means a bunch of students getting texts from their parents asking if they're OK. Then word gets around that there's a bomb and everyone starts freaking out.

3. We went not once, but both times to the gym when we had bomb threats. So now any crazy kid who actually wanted to do something horrible like that would know to plant a bomb in the gym and just call it in and have everyone show up there. 

4. The school was clearly not sneaky about this stuff. So when they brought in bomb dogs, some people could hear them or see them. But most kids mistook them for drug dogs which meant a bunch of kids would run back for their backpacks or to grab stuff out of their lockers at school, fearing they would be caught. "

3. That thing I tried yesterday was awful. I almost lost my prick and it didn't feel good. On the other hand, I have some lube handy..."

"&gt;This happened Sunday night.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My oldest son is in the Marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  He took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  At first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. When it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  I tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  He gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his Dress blues.  Now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  We go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  We settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... Free internet points and all that......
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I walk in and the house is quiet.  No one in the living room.  A little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  Alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I caught my wife cheating and my Marine son is in jail for beating her side piece up.

When they opened the door, despite me standing RIGHT next to the driver, all they saw was a dude in a uniform holding my bags. My mom burst into tears and it took me several minutes to calm her down and explain the situation. I never surprised them again. "

Then one day I figured out that if I took my arms out of the equation by sticking the loop at the end of the rope around my neck and THEN did a tarzan swing, it should work great!

And it worked!  For a given value of ""worked"" that meant my grandmother had the fright of her life as the curtains flew up to reveal me strangling in the window... successfully doing a tarzan swing.

What happened next I'll never be able to burn from my memory....

I heard a faint exhale, and then a light moan coming from the master bathroom.  I wasn't sure, but I thought maybe she's just having a go at herself, maybe get herself in the mood for sexy times.  She doesn't have a clue her son is here, and sometimes she can be a little inventive; it's one of the things I really love about her.

Not wanting to be rude, but also not wanting to leave our son waiting, I gently knock on the door and ask ""Honey?"".  Suddenly, I hear a loud ruckus, like a banging/smashing and the trashcan tipping over onto the floor.  Afraid she fell and hurt herself from the surprise knock, I open the door and there lays Mankind on top of an announcers table after the Undertaker had thrown him off the top of the cage during their Hell in a Cell match!"
