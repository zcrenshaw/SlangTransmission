never walk in without knocking
"*Neighbors knocking on the door*

He says ‚Äúcan you turn it down?‚Äù

I said ‚Äúain‚Äôt no music on‚Äù

He says ‚Äúnaw that weed is loud‚Äù

"Your willingness to be seen collecting unmentionables in broad daylight when everybody has a camera phone is evidence of your extraordinary strength of character. A weaker mind would have disowned them on the spot. 

Stand proud. You are destined for greatness. "
"Dad, is that.. ***THE WEED?***"
Can't wait to see the 'tifu by eating my girlfriend's ass right before my dad was expected home' post. 
Wow the grounding was unnecessary 
"Ironically, your friends knew how to keep a better poker face without glasses."
"Ob Gyn doctor here. He's seen that, and worse, tons of times. To him it's no big deal. Put your mind at ease. "
"At least you didn‚Äôt let her fart in your face and then destroy your room and go to the ER

Edit: Dang this blew up. Kinda like OP on those sheets"
"Yeah, he just said he's grateful I didn't wait longer. He's had women wait a week or 2. I thought 18 hours was bad. I don't even want to imagine how gross thatd be after 14 days. "
I guess she wasn't the one getting penetrated that night.
"When you say you assumed the worst, I‚Äôm thinking there was a moment you stood there like ‚Äúfuck I‚Äôve killed her‚Äù"
I would go commando until I could afford new underwear and never admit that I had anything to do with that hilarious underwear prank.
Joints are probably the worst way to smoke in an apartment complex. The smell just lingers for so long. 
"I don't think it would've been weird for you to have gone straight to the shower. After a day of traveling, it's not unreasonable for you to say you need to freshen up.

Edit: Well, this blew up a lot more than I anticipated."
She was going to smell it either way. I think it‚Äôs amusing how smokers don‚Äôt realize we can smell it üòâ
Your neighbour knows too by the way
Or she broke as fuck.
You should have asked if you were prohibited from ‚Äòtaking naps‚Äô too.
"Yeh you‚Äôre right, but overthinking simple shit is my speciality. "
"At least she learned her lesson and quit barging I‚Äôm on you

Edit: leaving it"

"Be proud. Aside from having a funny story to tell, now you know that you have a 10/10 ass."
"Honestly, I was not really sure what to think. She's in her 70's and I have no idea what this would do to a regular person, let alone someone her age. I thought she would've been seriously injured. I also expected her to have massive cuts from the glass and stuff, but we got so lucky that none of that happened. She was a bit winded, very shocked, but apart from the other injuries I mentioned above, that was about it. She's quite fit and does a lot of sport to this day, so that may have contributed to it, but either way, man. That was fucking terrifying. 

Oh also, she literally popped by after 5 minutes of me making this post with fucking mosquito nets for our balcony and windows because ""it's a priority to have these installed before spring hits in full force"". This woman is a tank. "
"If I understand correctly he's the only Doctor for the Health Center and I assume he's been there for years, so I guarantee he's seen so much worse than this from his own students...  this is college after all!  "
Point is other people don't want to smell that shit in their own house coming from someone else. Same with really any smell coming into your home.
"Good guys, they gave you 50 back. Next pitcher is on you lol"
Your wife just wanted to slice things up in the bedroom.
"I like to remember that now matter how gross I think I am making a doctor feel, the Swamps of Dagobah story is a thing that happened.

"My parents knew what knocking was. The problem is that they would barge in first, and then knock on the already open door."
I like how coffee got you into this mess and coffee got you oout of it. 
I'm glad my parents know what knocking is
"Nobody knows its you. Also you could just own it like 'ya that was me, isnt that hilarious? ' people would think youre mad confident. But let's talk about this obsession with Dominoes.... I mean you didn't have money for the dryer in the first place because you ordered too much Dominoes... it's not that good. Thanks for the update though! Have a good day"
"This was beautiful.  Best prank I ever pulled was putting a keyboard macro on my old roommates iPhone. I set it to change ‚Äúlol‚Äù to ‚ÄúI just had sex with a guy I met at the gas station‚Äù. It took three long weeks...

Edit: since this comment has 3 times as many upvotes as my previous top comment, I feel like I should add in the best part of the whole thing. This guy is mildly homophobic (not in a hateful way, but he gets really uncomfortable, idk why), so when the text was finally sent and it went to his only gay friend, he started freaking out and texting me about how he couldn‚Äôt believe it but he must have a virus on his iPhone somehow. Five minutes later I get another, shorter text: ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a fucking asshole‚Äù. 

As you can imagine, I was just about pissing myself laughing. Couldn‚Äôt breathe for several minutes. His friend got a pretty big kick out of it too and used the opportunity to really mess with him. 

Edit 2: r/IjhswagImatgs is now a thing apparently. "
Does she have flatulence problems Jesus she farted throughout the whole story.
That was a roller coaster of a story...he‚Äôll probably never be able to bring his girlfriend over for dinner without it being incredibly awkward..this‚Äôll probably be one of the main reasons he‚Äôll have for wanting his own place..

"That's actually pretty cool of him. Not a tifu but a lpt. When you live next to a cop, smoke somewhere else."
I once walked in on my little brother and had quite a conversation with him when he was in bed before his girl stuck her head out the side of the bed waist height to say she was up for food later also...

"After giving up smoking and taking up vaping, and getting my sense of smell back I realised (cigarette) smoke has about a 200m radius depending on wind direction. "
Yea punishing you because she is embarrassed by touching herself? 
"While technically speaking a fuck up, I feel this turned out to be rather beneficial for your Mother/Daughter relationship.

I just had sex with a guy I met at the gas station
"You were smoking on 4/20 because of your knee?

Sure thing dude."
Something makes me think you've been through this before.
I don't get it. Just make up some other explanation of how it happened?
"&gt;Yeh you‚Äôre right, but ~~overthinking simple~~ shit is my speciality. 

FTFY"
No way. Not a chance this happened
And pot smoke is about 1 km.
"Bet you looked cool as FUCK wearing sunglasses inside though. 

AS FUCK."
At least there were no skid marks. Unless there were. 
"or worse. Knock on the door and open it without waiting for an answer

Lol thats great. Made me crack up!
"She reminds me of my grandmother's boyfriend. Mid-nineties, broke his hip, went from a wheelchair to a cane to walking unassisted and bitching to my mother about not being able to walk as fast as he'd like. People like this just gain power as they get older. Soon she'll be unstoppable."
"My sister is an OBGYN. One time she had a patient come in and say ‚ÄúI did something stupid last night, I was at a bar and my Nuvaring fell out when I peed. I scooped it out and put it back in.‚Äù Of course my sister thinks wow this person is stupid/lacks a general sense of health and goes to get it out. Bingo...two Nuvarings. Yes, she pulled someone else‚Äôs out of the toilet and put it in herself. 

Yes they‚Äôve seen it all. "
LMAO that's pretty much asking to be grounded for another 2 months 
Don't put them in the dryer but hang them inside to dry. Sensitive fabrics don't like the dryer.  
"I think this is all good.

You tried to come to work early. You thought outside the box and located the CEO's number. You had the balls to call. You showed initiative."

No kidding lol why did sex come up at all? Did he not have enough time to button his shirt back up on the way to the hospital?
Somebody has to be the worst though
IBS. It can strike at stressful times. Like your boyfriends dad walking in while his son eats your chocolate button. 
And there‚Äôs nothing quite like seeing blood pour from the crack of a 10/10 ass.
Would have cost me less money haha.
For real. My next door neighbour smokes it and I get whiffs of it inside my house with just a window cracked open. If I‚Äôm outside in the driveway while he‚Äôs smoking it‚Äôs super obvious. Our houses aren‚Äôt even particularly close together but there‚Äôs no hiding it. 
"The biggest thing is she forgives you. She knew it was an accident! Not being in your situation though, I think it‚Äôs hilarious. "

"This. The smell of pot is really, really pungent. There is nothing subtle about it."
"I mean, the potential volume of Dad jokes that can come from this one event.... You‚Äôre set for life man!"
"Nah, it's still real weird, getting a kid to not jack off would be like turning back the tide"
"It's bizarre, it seemed to me from OP's story that they weren't even having sex yet, just kissing etc. There was zero reason for them to bring it up."

"Ugh, tell me about the Dominoes obsession. At the beginning of the month, I rewarded myself twice because I had finished two super important assignments. It escalated from there.

It's also an easy option, since I live in a super secluded area and there aren't much options for food. 

Edit: Apart from the foodcourt, which is mundane at best."
"More like if even if there aren't cops as neighbors, but just neighbors in general. Not everyone wants to smell that shit."

"agreed. I don't care if people smoke. I think it should be legal and all and i will sign the petition and check the box on the voting papers. But i don't want to smell it in my apartment, and I do smell it and it pisses me off. I just don't like the smell of it. "
Damn that‚Äôs awkward! Serious question though - I know sometimes it‚Äôs possible to forget you have a tampon in but how did your boyfriend not see/feel it?? 
Did the nurses give the cut a 10 or your ass a 10? I will need pics of both for proper judgement. 
Lol seems like parents punishments are always worse when you do something slightly wrong that exposes them doing something they'd crucify you for

Too much farting. I think that‚Äôs what turned into into bullshit for me. 
Better yet. Say nothing and serve a chili.
People often do this. Why do people do this? What's the fucking point of doing it?
And if he does bring then his dad can jokingly bring up this incident while having dinner
As well as cutting right into the action

"One time, I was at work and the IT guy (who was actually cool and not the quintessential IT guy stereotype we all know and love), sent me a message over AIM asking me if I dropped a thong. I had to shamefully shuffle over to his cube, where he handed me my underwear. 

Edit: It was in 2004 for a tech company (when we all used AIM or messenger for communicating). Most of the people were not from the area, and mostly men. He saw me walk to the bathroom with a bag to change into my workout gear.  He was totally cool about it too. Thank god. I was mortified. "

"This happened with my wife and I once. Got drunk, had sex, forgot she had one in. I think the next day, or maybe the day after she was finally like, I'm pretty sure you jammed a tampon all up in me, can you check. The smell alone had already been turning, and I suspected she was right, which I confirmed after some deep probing. I did what any loving husband would do, and went tampon digging. Eventually, after a while of no success, she just told me to not worry about hurting her and to just get it out. I think this is the closest I've come to fisting her, but after some tears from her and some nimble cooperation from my fingers, I got that tampon out, much to her relief."

Sounds like your teacher has a fragile ego and took it out on a child to feel better. Regale in knowing that at 12 years old you showed more maturity then I bet that teacher has shown in their entire career

My brother used to do that to me. The only time i got to wear his mirror aviators was when we were playing cards..

"You know, I watched her play tennis the other day and I've never actually watched her play before, but holy fuck she probably runs faster than I do. She told me later that when she was a young girl, she honed this skill by stealing apples from the boys and running away from them. I don't know how true this is, but I definitely wouldn't doubt her after I saw her run.  

She's definitely en-route to unlimited power, for sure."
"""I feel bad so everyone should feel even worse"""
What the frick? No! What the heck! I didn't order that! I ordered an Xbox card! Oh wow no I did *not* order that.
"I mean. He definitely seemed like he was being more a good neighbor than a police officer. He doesn't want to do police work when hes at home, and especially not to a neighbor. Just be more courteous next time."
You could probably still wear the aviators. Just don't put the cards up to your face. You can corner peek and still know what you have. 
My old neighbor used to smoke and I always had my window open. One day the wind brought the smell into my room like wildfire and my mom came to my room asking if I was doing drugs.
