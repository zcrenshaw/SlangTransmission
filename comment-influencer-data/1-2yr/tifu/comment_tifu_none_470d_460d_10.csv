But as other people are saying your best bet is to spin it into a story where you are the hero who is so dedicated to doing your best for the company that you put yourself out of a job.

"I have epilepsy and am a woman. Don‚Äôt feel bad. One night me and my fianc√© had some of the roughest sex I‚Äôve ever had in my life. It was good. 

Turns out during I ruptured an ovarian cyst (apparently that is something that can happen) and got a super sharp pain and threw me into a seizure as soon as I stood up and felt the pain. Still top 5 best sex I‚Äôve ever had. 

Edit: a word

Edit2: and my top comment is about me having sex, pain, and having a seizure, thank you. Also I want to clarify, the sex wasn‚Äôt great because he ruptured a cyst. 

The sex was great prior, it just turned out to be so vigorous that the cyst ruptured and afterwards I felt the pain  when I went to stand. Gentlemen please don‚Äôt aim to rupture cysts for your lady friends. "

"I remember when I was 17 at a college party, and wanted to look cool in front of everyone. I refused to drink any of the coolers or beer. Instead, I insisted on only drinking neat whiskey.

Yeah I was disappointed....

"I was with a girl once that gave me a warning ahead of time. She said every time she orgasms she blacks out and sees a color. I thought it was kinda weird but whatever, I was getting laid. Sure enough it happened and she just kinda went shook for a moment and then opened her eyes. All she said was, ""yeah that was a green orgasm."" It was too weird."

"You don't want to tell the company how to work smarter, because they'll streamline and automate you out of a job. If a company hires a 10 people to do some work and you've found a way to do it with 2, 8 people are gonna be out of a job because the amount of work hasn't changed.

If you can find a private way to make your job easier and look like youre still working the whole time, then you've found a way to work smarter. "

"I will preface this by saying that I am old enough to know better: a couple months ago my friend and I sat down to drink and watch TV and he mixed a drink really strong. I was smashed and because he was drinking it so slowly, I picked it up and chugged it, calling him a weenie. I promptly blacked out. "

For my 16th birthday party a friend brought over some alcohol to drink after everyone went to sleep. He brought a water bottle full of scotch. He said it was really old and his dad never drank it so he wouldn‚Äôt know. (Not only did we get caught but it was apparently rare and expensive.) We didn‚Äôt like the taste so we lined up 6 shots each. Went from trashed to throwing up faster than a Tesla goes 0-60 in inane mode. 
Yes this needs to be at the top! i've done psychedelics many times never had anything close to this. These friends sound crazy man. 
"This- embarrassed verbal apology can do so much, but by offering this little gesture you are both supporting your co-worker at her difficult time of her life and show that it was a genuine mistake you want to correct as you care about her."
"Not very long...my boss brought me nice flowers after I sliced my fingers. This incident was a rough first day, but not a reason to stop working. I left because prior to being a florist, my boss was a psychotherapist and he started psychoanalysing me, finding weird Freudian reasons as to why I cut ribbons wrong. Kinda weird guy. "
"I had an ex-gf run into the bedroom and do like a half-Superwoman half-Spiderwoman jump towards me...buttass naked...instincts were to protect myself by bringing my arms and knee up...covering the face and ""goods"". Well...she landed vag first onto my knee. Her labia swelled and bruised to the point it was black. She had an ob-gyn appt not even a week later. She was coined Lovely Labia from that point on."
A little late now but next time please call the police. Making meth leaves a residue on the walls and floors that has to be removed professionally because it can make people sick (like future renters-especially babies). It‚Äôs called third hand meth.

You think an old lady who calls her electricity provider when there‚Äôs poop everywhere in her apartment knows how to redeem an amazon gift card?
I had a similar thing happen with one of my cats.  I was in the middle of taking a piss when the cat decided it was the best time to climb up on the side of the bowl to get a look at the action.  Pissed all over the cat.  Then I had to chase a piss soaked cat around the house so I could wash her off.  That was fun.

Word it on the resume you saved your company $150k+ per year by identifying inefficiencies and developing a more streamlined account processing system. Or something. If they bring it up in the interview tell them you've got more ideas and you're just getting started. Your old company is a bunch of morons for letting you go. 
"Also, medical amnesty should prevent you from getting a possession charge. A letter from court is not valid, by the way, unless it's delivered by a public servant such as a police officer.

Don't just write that you're sorry for your fuck up. That makes it appear as a selfish endeavour to make her stop thinking Ill of you. Write that you're sorry for her loss and that you in some small way might have added to her pain. Offer the coffee or gift as something that will in some some small way lessen that pain or make her day a little better because she deserves it after your fuck up and after all she's been through.

"Huh?  What parts wrong other than the falling out the window and me being a slob, and the use of escorts regularly, and the Avril Lavigne boner, and the blanket fortress?"
Hahaha who the fuck can stand and pee while browsing reddit with a 2 year old hanging off their legs. The more important question is why would anyone attempt to do such a thing in the first place? Even without the kid being there browsing reddit while standing and peeing doesn't sound too practical. Funny though. 
"Hey I appreciate that. It sounds like an exaggeration but my hand is a bit of a balloon tonight.

You are not literally throwing babies against a wall (i hope) or killing babies so what does that have to do with this guys kid? Was his kid thrown against a wall? Don't feel bad man (i assume) it's just a joke and it is not your fault he couldn't handle it."
"Oh i know, when i was only a couple years old and just learning how to talk, i put my underwear on backwards (such that the fly was by my bum). My dad laughed and started joking in a singsong voice ‚ÄúRobert wears girl underwear‚Äù, i didn‚Äôt understand the joke but laughed because it sounded funny. Cut to later that day he takes me to the grocery store, I‚Äôm bored and the store is crowded so i starting singing out loud in that same singsongy way ‚ÄúDaddy wears girl underwear‚Äù, safe to say he got a lot of uncomfortable looks.

Bad advice. A nail file would definitely hurt her more than his finger did.
"Hell this is the opposite of my experience. I had a string of roommates my 2nd year ranging from pot dealers that wouldn't sell to my other roommates and a heroin addict that had his friends over and passed out covered in blood in the court yard. The school kicked out the pot dealer but wouldn't touch the herion addict for some reason. 

Then I moved into an apartment that was significantly cheaper than dorms and I got to choose my roommate. "
So you powerbombed her onto a concrete floor from 5-6 feet up and she just laughed it off? She sounds like a keeper.

"I knew a group of guys who worked in the accounting department for a chain of big box stores right as learning to program was just starting as a hobby and not just a career. they all worked together to automate their entire department besides pure data entry, they all gave up 1/10th of their salary  to one guy who spent the entire day entering all of the data for the entire department so he made bank and they were all free to work second jobs online, 1 guy taught programming, 1 guy joined an mlm \(and actually managed to make money with his experience\) and the third lived very very frugally so he gamed all day every day and just accepted the pay cut. they all started a company to do exactly what they were doing but for other companies and gave a free copy to their old company seeing as how they scammed them for years and all left suddenly

What I especially love about this story is OP's recognizing his hypocrisy at looking down at a woman whom was probably a better person then than he was.  Clearly he's grown as a human.  I'm impressed.
"I worked as a 911 operator and at least in my area the person who called would not have been charged.

I tried to throw my gf on the bed once, but the wall was too close and my superior throwing skills just decided to pop in right then.

"Exactly this, the only *possible* taste to expect from a tab may be some bitterness from the ink used but 9.99/10 times its tasteless.

Another good way to tell if lsd or not if it has a taste, swallow it when you take it. Lsd is orally active, nbomes are not they are sublingal or whatever, you have to keep them in your mouth for a while to feel effects.

Edit: of course reagent testing is the best and only true test, but if you're at a party or something where you can't test, swallowing the tab is a good option"
Please go wash your hands

"At a small kickback with friends: one of them was smashed, like to the point that I had a bag in my pocket specifically for when they started heaving smashed, but they kept going back to the drink table for more alc even though we cut her off. 

We kept having to grab the Fireball out of her hand before she poured herself any more, but one time we were late, and she poured herself a cup full of something. My buzzed mind thought ""hey, I have high tolerance, and we need to get rid of this alcohol but not waste it, so I'll just chug it.""

Right as the first gulp went down, I noticed that this tasted a lot like straight Fireball, but my intoxicated mind didn't realize what that meant until I had downed the cup. I drank about 8-9 shots of fireball in that cup, and a half hour later, I was curled up in a ball wishing the world would stop spinning long enough for me to puke in the toilet."

"So in high school I used to sneak my boyfriend over every Friday night and on one of those nights he brought a bottle of Wild Turkey. I had never drunk more than a sip of beer or a gulp of 4 loko, never had hard liquor, so what happened next was not surprising. 

My mom had a glass cup with drink mix lines on it all the way around. [Like this](http://kgbmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/mixglass-1024x1024.jpg). I poured 8 oz of wild Turkey and basically chugged it. 10 minutes later I wasnt really feeling it so I poured another 8oz and chugged it. I'm pretty sure I felt it after that cause I only remember images of that night. 

I remember telling him I was going to puke. Standing/leaning in my doorway. Sobbing uncontrollably in the bathroom asking him to make me puke. And then pissing, shitting, vomiting, and having my period all at once. I dont remember doing this, but apparently I looked at him dead in the face and said ""clean it"" and walked my ass back to bed. Best boyfriend I ever had cause he saw me at my lowest point and stuck around years afterwards!"
"I had a co-worker who was making a smoothie. Accidentally knocked the blender off the table while mixing. Went to catch it, as OP did, and ended up sticking her hand right into the blender.

Edit: the second part is a surprisingly easy mistake to make because the way you say to commit suicide literally means ""to make yourself lost"" (kinda poetic, I guess?), and the way to say I got lost literally means ""I went to lost,"" so if you're an English speaker and you guess ""I got myself lost,"" you'd be reasonable but very wrong.

why are you letting your mother clean that up do it yourself -_-
It was pretty bad...she laughed and cried...needless to say there was no sexy time for awhile. 
"This may have been it. I don't remember exactly how she described it, something about wires being crossed in her brain, but this seems reasonable."
You wouldn't. It was a crass hyperbole intended to humorously describe the consumption of a lot of Mountain Dew
He said he doesn't remember much after getting in the ambulance. He might have freaked out and done some not-good things in the ambulance or hospital.

I knew that dogs anesthesia wasn't deep enough and I won't make that mistake again, even if I risk my reputation looking holier than thou. If they give me lip, I'll kindly say that they aren't the one who'll be having to deal with a hospital visit. "
"One time I drank natural light, followed by moonshine with cotton candy dissolved in it. We had a brand new deck. I woke up puking into a freshly set post-hole in the rain. My vomit is permanently a part of that quikrete."
"Lemme offer a counterpoint:

3 person room first semester, one roommate is chill, plays guitar and stuff like I do. We instantly click. The other roommate was (only trying to build you a visual here) a very large (read as fuckinG JACKED)and flamboyant theater major. He is a garbage human. 

First morning starts with Kesha blasting Tick Tock st 6 AM. That's his alarm. He goes to shower and leaves it blaring in the tiny ass dorm. 

Unplugged. Every morning. For 2 weeks.

The second week in, I wake up to a knock on the door. I look over and this guy has a dude in his bed with him fucking, (I don't care) but then he says his BF must be knocking. The dude gets under the bed and my roommate has sex with his BF. Bf leaves and the dude under the bed gets back to fucking him too. 



This was like 3am on a school night. 


Anyway, we had planned to make him want to leave the dorm somehow to get the ok roommates cool friend in.


Never had to happen, he got kicked off campus for breaking a kids nose over who's a better dancer.

I giggled like an asshole at this comment. oh man hahaa 
Been there a few times. My favorite move is to curl around the toilet and let the sweet sweet chill of the porcelain throne drift me off to sleep. Disgusting? Yep but God damn is it soothing.

"The weekend after 9-11 I was out at a neighborhood block yard sale.  At the last house on the street I am looking at the stuff for sale on the ground when I look up and see a Sikh man.  I was surprised, because we don't have many here.  I say 'You must be having a really rough week.'  And he says 'Everyone thinks I am Muslim.  A week ago, no one cared'.  "
Your enthusiasm alone earns an upvote.

"You saved the company 150K a year.  Ask the boss for a letter of recommendation, put that on your resume, and you'll get hired at the next place."
wait.. so you did not ask for your property back?
"This. OP's ex company is a complete douche, OP deserves better. (At least) at my firm, the person who suggested getting the automation software would have been the one that was kept behind though."

Every day I see examples of why it‚Äôs better to sit back and do minimal work without trying to improve anything. Really messes with my built in need to streamline and fix things at work. 
You did the right thing IMO. Things could have gotten worse. Someone could have got (more?) hurt. The only problem is you getting felony charges. It's stupid that people can be afraid to call the cops in a dangerous situation because they have taken drugs. Something is wrong in society if people are afraid of calling cops because the cops might put them in jail or take their money when all they want is to not get hurt.
"If you ever wind up in this situation again. You should call the police. By not calling them you jeopardized your entire future.

It sounds like unknown people were all over your house, in your room etc. If your house got raided and you had drugs in your room or even in your house and your name was on the lease, you could be lumped in with her and found guilty. Say goodbye to college and jobs. You'd have been fucked.

This also goes for driving people places. As a driver you are held accountable for what you are transporting. That includes drugs you don't know passengers are carrying.

Don't associate with people like this unless you are willing to bear the risks associated with doing so. "
Am dad. Never happened to me. Who just whips their hog out with a kid clamped on their leg?
"He didn't even make that joke, he was asked

I‚Äôd rather they just stole the whole bottle.  To think your scotch had to spend its last hours in a plastic water bottle is too much.  That poor scotch.  ‚òπÔ∏è
"OP will be emotionally damaged for at least the next 3 Memorial days, and pretty much hurt their coworker in a really bad way. I really fail to see how it is breaking rule 2. Unless it isn't a ""conscious"" decision? The consequences are definitely more than just embarrassment. We aren't talking about confusing someone's birthday for a day too early or something."
"Indeed.  Especially a few days later, to let her know you're continuing to think about it"
