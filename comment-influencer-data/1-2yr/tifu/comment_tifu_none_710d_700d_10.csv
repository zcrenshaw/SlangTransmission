There's a story about a director who was flying from Los Angeles to New York to create a first episode of a new TV program, to try to sell it for production. Imagine the scene when security asked him why he was going to New York and he said ""I'm going there to shoot a pilot."""

I met this chick on a pedal pub, we hit it off and I invited her to my place to watch Netflix and hang out, not knowing the connotation. 10 minutes into Breaking Bad she jumps me and I just roll with it.

"The Dr visit was extremely awkward. I was freaking out because there was so much blood, but they got me back fairly quickly. It was a basic pelvic exam to assess the damage, but this Urgent Care was not really one that did traumatic wound care. It's more like an after care or flu shot type walk in clinic. But being a Sunday, it was my only option besides an ER, which I didn't want to go to if I didn't have to because my last ER visit set me back $1K out of pocket.

As for the stitches, they gave me several shots of lidocaine and used a dissolvable suture. Thankfully I got lucky, or as lucky as I could have with this injury. The wound fell right in the first fold of the inner labia in a straight line. Currently the area is black and blue and pretty swollen. But the Dr said that cosmetically and functionality wise, it was an extremely clean tear and will heal with a very minimal hairline scar and no damage to any nerves. It shouldn't even be noticeable to anyone who didn't know it was there.  "

"/u/jonwinslol would love to see an update on this. Totally awesome of /u/denimpanzer to gift them to you. I can't wait to pay it forward as well on my end. I was and still am going through a very bad financial situation but I finally got a job that starts on Oct 15th! 

Long story short, I signed on to GTA Online on PC and asked randomly if anyone would order a hungry and poor stranger a pizza. To my surprise, someone answered yes and actually ordered me a large dominos half cheese, half pepperoni pizza. I was so grateful that night. 

At first I was a little worried it might be a troll who orders a crap ton of food and sends it to my place with ""Cash: as the payment option. But he reassured me that he's just trying to help a person out so he asked for my Snapchat and I sent him my details through that. Just my address and the pizza I wanted cause that's all he needed.

About thirty minutes later and I get a knock on my door after he sent me a snap of the pizza tracker. 

I actually started tearing up when I was talking to him on discord once the food arrived because of how my heart felt knowing someone actually fed me, a stranger. Once I start working, I'm going to look out for those who are hungry because I know how it feels. "
"So beyond the school blaming you, were there any other consequences arising from this? Also what did you do with the locker key after you found it?"

Guys always act like I'm overreacting about how much I dread having to pee on hikes, but they don't understand that it's genuinely much more difficult than it is for men.

Go downstairs to the smoking area, taking the girl with me. Phoned Barclays and cancelled the card ASAP.

While on the phone to Barclays another guy picked up my girl.

5 minutes later I found the card in my pocket, now unusable because it was cancelled.

Apparently he didn't cooperate with their demands and one of them hurt his thumb kicking his ass so he got charged with assaulting a police officer and a laundry list of other shit that pretty much ruined his life and he couldn't even remember what happened to try to defend himself in court.
