Send him one back
"1. No one forgets a ""big project"" that's due that day.

2. She didn't offer to reschedule.

Move on. "
"Especially if OP is bigger. I know it's meaningless really, but that would really fuck with the dude's head and he totally deserves it."
"In all honesty, I'd stand by and see how my GF deals with it. Shows a lot about how important your relationship is to her. I'd also want to talk about it with her to resolve this in a civil way. Then do a drive-by with a bag of 2 weeks old dog poop."
"If you party in poop's house, don't be surprised when poop shows up. "
"photoshop his dick into various scenarios, send him weekly updates on places his dick has been..."
Send back a picture of the both of you pointing and laughing. That would get the message across. 
"I mean, I did promise to fuck the shit out of her... so just kinda rolled with it "
Doesn't even have to be op's dick!
I like this sub because the mods hate all the users
Ended a 3 year relationship because I was bored with the sex and thought I was missing out on sex with other people. Now I only have sex like twice a month and I wish I could fuck my ex but she‚Äôs engaged lol life‚Äôs a beach 
"Not great. Something about me screams ‚Äúboyfriend material,‚Äù so I was just having the ‚Äúnot looking for anything serious‚Äù conversation over and over. "
"I don't watch my language depending on whether or not women are present, I watch my language depending on what social setting I am in.

At work? At home? In public? That's really the only thing that matters to me. "
"Falling in love just because you were lonely alone and suddenly have someone, despite a lot of red flags. I've definitely done it, those honeymoon period goggles can be powerful and make you think you found ""the one"", when really you were just looking for ""someone"" at the time "
"Yup. I got in a wreck and broke my leg. I was out of work on a job I had just started a month ago for 4 months. We thought for sure I was fired. She quit her job so she could get a job closer to home. Prep cook for a chain restaurant. She was worried about having to drive 45 mins back home if I needed her. 

We both lived with my dad at the time and he wasn‚Äôt much help. We got kicked out (for lack of a better term) while I still had my cast on. One of our friends were kind enough to let us crash in their spare bedroom, which was more like a closet. 

At some point she got a second job while I tried to figure out my job situation. Then out of nowhere my boss said ‚Äúyou really impressed me for that one month, I want to rehire you.‚Äù Around the same time she got like ~4 promotions and ended up being a corporate trainer for some time. 

We‚Äôve been together since high school. We‚Äôre both turning 26 this year and our wedding is this Saturday :)

EDIT: Wow I didn‚Äôt expect so many upvotes. Pretty sure this is my top comment. Thanks guys, this weekend is going to be a lot of emotions. 

EDIT 2: holy shit 1.2k? I‚Äôm honored! Funny how little I think people would be interested in my actual life. It‚Äôd honestly make a good book or movie."
"Part of it is because what a lot of women think are ""obvious hints"" of attraction aren't really obvious at all."

"For me it‚Äôs important because I take care of myself. If I didn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt hold her to the same standard. "
I've been here 2 weeks and I already hate you all üëç
"On to the next.  Don't try and reschedule.  If she's genuinely interested then she'll try and make it up.

Until then minimal contact... or none at all."
"Was with a girl where she absolutely loved anal. We would have it very regularly. Wash off, pee, kiss the person on the mouth in thanks for butt sex. If you're going into anal sex expecting it to be clean cut all the time, you're in for a bad time eventually. "
"This is hilariously accurate. I was just explaining to my friends how I ""get women"" but don't have sex. 

I'm currently talking to a few women who I know are interested in a relationship with me, but I only *really* want a girl who doesn't want a relationship right now. 

So, I can either lead these women on for sex and eventually hurt them, or do what I'm doing now, which is digging myself into friendships with all of them while sitting alone on my phone venting about why I can't seem to find mutual interest for a relationship."
"I wouldn't do anything, but I'd ask her how she's handling it and re-evaluate the relationship based on it.

If it's ""Oh, you know him, he's like that!"" I'm automatically less serious about her.

If it's, ""So, I told him not to contact me again and blocked him"", we're fine.

I'm not here to tell her how to respond appropriately to advances. If she doesn't know how to do that by now, we're now casual."
"As long as she's not so out of shape that her health suffers or it interferes with our activities, I'm ok. "
"I don't regret it but at the end of the line it still all feels a bit meaningless. With that being said I'm happy I didn't stay in it and end up being an awful boyfriend or resenting the girl I was with because of it. Sometimes you just gotta go out and make the mistakes and learn the lessons rather than settling with the idea that you're ""probably right"". The lessons always come at a cost though. "
"""Yeah, they call me Thin Diesel"""
"""Are you 100% over your ex?"""

Jesus.
Yes this exactly
"Because it's comparatively rare for people to tell men that they're attractive. And on numerous occasions, I've thought that people were clearly into me and I was wrong - so I've learn to assume the opposite."

"I always answer honestly. 

""I feel like you value your relationship with your friends more than this one. Is that it?""

After dating like a week? Yes, of course I value them more than you. She didn't like that."

"The whole ""guys are oblivious"" thing is no where near as big of a thing as it's made out to be. The truth is, most guys are cautious because for every actual green light there's like 5 more ""looks like a green light but not actually a green light"" and misreading certain cues can have lots of repercussions.

My dad‚Äôs wife was. He‚Äôs really well off now and she‚Äôs younger and skinny and blonde so she catches a lot of assumptions. She was there from the black Astro van and shag brown carpet to the Porsche 911 and the Four Seasons! Love that woman.   
i will fukkin fite you rite now meet me somewhere bish
Pretty bad for several months if I'm being honest. I thought I would get a ton of sex my way and forgot how hard it is to get laid. Eventually started getting some momentum by the 5th month and it's been pretty decent so far. 
"People into anal are into it enough to look past a bit of poop. It‚Äôs only smells. 

If you‚Äôre grossed out by it then maybe anal isn‚Äôt for you. Life ain‚Äôt a porn video, yo. Unless the woman is giving herself an intense colon cleanse before every anal sex romp then shit happens. "
"You should respect her wishes, but she needs to respect herself and your relationship enough to stand up to this shit and shut it down, and you can give her your support in that."
"My wife and I have a standard that both of us must be able fit into our wedding dress/suit. We were both a bit chubby at the time so it's a very reasonable limit.

It's not like it's insta-divorce, but if you're bigger than that it's time to cut back on the fast food or something."
"Bo Burnham has a funny response to that in one of his specials.   Something like when someone calls him skinny he says, ‚Äúlet me describe YOU physically.‚Äù  It really is crazy how it‚Äôs okay to call someone skinny but unacceptable to call someone fat.  "
"Hello!

I was in a 12 year relationship. SUPER INSECURE about only have banged 2 people. 

Went out, banged a lot of people. Like several multiples of the national average and I'd give up a major limb to get back into a relationship with one person I really love and care about. 

I mean maybe it ends up being worth it to other people but my slutty post break up fuck boi phase was the most depressing, emotionally harmful phase of my life. 

But I learned a lot about myself from it and came out the other side with a much clearer view of who I am and what I want out of life. 

So... mixed bag?"

"Full disclosure, I don‚Äôt think my girlfriend is hot. But I‚Äôm never going to tell her that. She makes me extremely happy and looks are going to fade anyways. She‚Äôs beautiful on the inside, and we have a great sex life, so hell yeah I tell her she‚Äôs hot. Her self-confidence is important to me, and when she feels good about herself her smile will light up the room.

OP fucked up big time, but it‚Äôs not unsalvageable. I just really don‚Äôt envy him.

Honestly there‚Äôs only one way to handle it. ‚ÄúHoney, I‚Äôm an idiot, and sometimes I say stupid stuff. I do think you‚Äôre hot. I was trying to communicate that I don‚Äôt see you as just a sex object or a piece of ass, but being the dumbass that I am I thought that saying it as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre hot‚Äù was a good idea. I didn‚Äôt consider your self-confidence, you just come across as a very confident person and in my stupid head I saw it going something along the lines of ‚Äòhe cares about me for who I am, not just for my body‚Äô. I don‚Äôt know how to ask you to put up with my dumbass self, because I really screwed the pooch on this one. I just want you to know that I do think you‚Äôre hot. You just happen to be dating an idiot who‚Äôs foot isn‚Äôt big enough to stop up his dumb mouth.‚Äù

Something like the above is the only way I think you‚Äôre going to salvage this one. Otherwise you will probably soon find yourself single.

edit: holy crap, you guys must have liked this. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever gotten this many upvotes in such a short period of time. I didn‚Äôt think anyone would even read it haha. pretty sure this is my most upvoted comment, but I have no clue how to check. My old reddit account once had a post on AskReddit that got like 25k upvotes, but I was never able to replicate that success

more serious edit: I wish she could read all this and hear the nice things you guys are saying, but I literally led off with saying I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs hot. Since I‚Äôm not OP and have no desire to be in his shoes, I do not want her to read that. I think she would probably not understand that I‚Äôm still attracted to her and love her deeply. Oh well."
Maybe wait until SHE mentions rescheduling. Otherwise leave it alone
"Important.  I like doing activities that require some level of physical fitness.  It would be nice for her to be able to do these things with me, because I'm not going to stop these activities.

"I used to be very skinny.  My response was often ""Yeah, I have this diet pill addiction I can't beat.""  This is definitely not professionally or socially appropriate.  But it did make the other person feel very awkward, which was my goal."

"broke up with my high school sweetheart and girlfriend of almost 5 years so that i could fuck other girls. gave her the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too good for me‚Äù excuse which was true tbh. she was super cute, had her head on straight, loved me to death, the whole 9. but being the cocky immature fucker that i was i didn‚Äôt realize it until it was too late. did i achieve what i set out to do? most definitely. do i regret throwing years worth of time and energy invested in someone away? most definitely. don‚Äôt get me wrong, fucking whoever i want to fuck is great and all but there‚Äôs still that little piece of me that believes i should‚Äôve kept my keeper. the sea is vast nonetheless!"

"Why do I feel so anxious about the relationship all the time?

The answer would have been because I was a placeholder for her; she didn't feel the spark towards me that I felt towards her. If I had thought critically about the relationship I would have ended it before I got blindsided by her breaking up with me because I would have realized I didn't want to feel so anxious in a relationship. Ideally the growth in the relationship should feel way less like a game."
"Independent. Self-sufficient. Emotionally stable. Confident. 

You know, the things women look for in guys. "
"Absolutely do not try again. 

She wasn't that into it and wasn't polite enough to let you know ahead of time. Not cool."
"I have something still for everyone I was in a relationship with. I loved them, it didn't work out, we moved on, but there's still a little tiny bit of that there, and I think it would be dishonest of myself to say there wasn't anything."

Get out 
relatable. also i expect both of us to take care of ourselves so we can have decent stamina for some good sex
"I had a friend who did this and it corrupted him. He got laid a lot but was really manipulative and exploited the vulnerabilities of the women he slept with. Not all of them were vulnerable but he openly admitted that he liked it when they were because there was inherent shame in the exploiting of them, on both sides.

I dunno it probably isn‚Äôt this way for everyone who ups the bed count. I guess it depends on how healthily you go about it.

Just some of the people I know who develop over time a lack of respect for the women they chase. When it came to them finding someone who they genuinely wanted to be with, they would cheat on them. 

My friend openly admitted that he cheated because he didn‚Äôt value the intimacy he had with the woman. So he sought out the intimacy which had turned him on which was the seedier side he had become accustomed too.

So in a way he became addicted to the soulless sex. He literally could not reconcile his need for meaningless exploitative sex.

"Not setting boundaries as soon as possible, this can be with anything but most importantly setting boundaries when it comes to the opposite/attractive sex. Unspoken expectations will almost always end in disappointment, resentment, and a break-up. "
"Pretty much.  I don't want a gymrat, personally, but keeping within a reasonable margin of a healthy weight/fitness level is pretty important."
Some of us have a hard time believing we are attractive at times.  We don‚Äôt see the signs that someone is attracted to us because we don‚Äôt often believe we can be attractive to someone.  Men often suffer from insecurity....even if they try to come off confident.  It‚Äôs been a part of the male role enforced by society that you don‚Äôt show weakness.  That doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt there.
"Boom. This is the answer. Even if a girl's hints are very obvious and it's 90% certain she's flirting... that still means there's a 10% chance she's not.

And if you fall into that 10%, it's just real bad. Best case scenario you lose out on a potential nice platonic relationship because now she feels awkward and avoids you forever, and you suffer schaudenfreude in your social circle because if there's one thing people love it's watching others fail. Worst case scenario, you get your ass #MeToo'd and become known as ""ugh, I was just having a good time and this dude decided to objectify me, can't even go to a bar without some creep making it about sex and dating"".

Inb4 people say I'm overreacting, all of the above has happened to me."

"I'd like to see a documentary where they take a few liberal master PhD students from ivy league schools and plant them in a blue collar conservative town over a year. Subsequentally I'd like to see them take a few country boys and record their exposure to the day to day lives of an I-banker, inner city schools, and mental health workers.

I'd be interested in the results of this cross culture experiment. "
"Im kind of a health nut, so in the past it was a huge deal. Most of my SOs were people I met at the gym in the first place since it's the one place I spend like 2 hours a day at anyway. 

However, my new girlfriend is definitely less fit than my normal type. She's not super overweight or anything, but she's soft basically everywhere. And I fucking love it. I can't go back. It's amazing. 

She has been going to the gym with me and Im teaching her a lot of weightlifting stuff. She's gotten really into it since she always got bored with doing standard cardio stuff that most girls do at the gym. 

A lot of my friends initially gave me shit because I'm ""out of her league"" or some bullshit. I don't care. We've been together for two months and it's been amazing. It was the kind of relationship that started out as friends and eventually I realized that I really, really liked spending time with this girl as a person even if I wasn't extremely attracted to her at the time. It's weird how that effects you. 

I also have a suspicion also that after another few months at the gym, her body is going to be crazy town since she's really getting into it and genuinely good at a lot of this stuff. 

At the same time though, I like the softness of her body as it is right now. It's the Larry David Gif. That being said, I know Im going to like her regardless. "
"Yes this precisely... You think a girl is flirting with you, you ask her out and you're told it's just friendship. Happens like three times and I just stop assuming that people see anything date worthy in me. "
"&gt;I don't think you're hot, I think you're beautiful. 

That's probably your best shot."
"that is perfect!! I used to just roast the shit out of their dick pic, and then the next thing you know, they‚Äôre defending and hyping up their dick to you and eventually they get lost in it then have a moment of clarity like ‚Äúshit.... i‚Äôm literally trying to convince this girl who‚Äôs seen my duck that I have a nice dick... this is fuckin sad. And they either stop, or call you a whore. It‚Äôs 50/50."
"Ask ten men and you'll get ten different answers. None of these examples are universal, but what I've seen and/or experienced is...

* Men are considered valuable for their actions over their appearance. Sure, appearance matters, but some men will dismiss the idea that someone could be attracted to them if that man hasn't done anything to ""prove themselves.""

* They ignore all but direct statements of intent because they don't want to be seen as making unwarranted assumptions or overstepping their bounds.

* Fear that putting effort into or acknowledging one's own appearance in a positive way could be seen as feminine."
"This is the winner, preferably followed by a despondent stare into nothing that might imply that OP is somehow supernatural."
"My experience was I left someone who I was with for over a year for more action.  What I experienced was this....some girls, they just want your attention.  Some girls will pretend to not look for something serious, but really want the relationship.  Some are absolutely fantastic.  Some are really bitter.  The majority are insecure about one thing or another, but if you get them to open up about it, they'll connect with you, and that connection is really great.  

I've learned that I enjoy a great connection, sex or not."
Twice a month sounds pretty nice. Much more than that would really cut into my sitting around time. 
But are you allowed to get to a size that you don't fit in the suit because you've made such sick gains?
"I see many people who, when their SO brings up an issue that they'd like to talk about and address, they undermine the other with personal attacks instead of talking about it rationally to find a solution. For example, ""Hey, I'd really appreciate it if you cleaned the bathroom more often"". 
""Well, you never clean anything in the kitchen, and I never say anything, so you can't get on my case about not cleaning.""

It pains me to hear people do this because it's so damaging to a relationship"

"Yeah, she‚Äôs shut him down in the past but this is next level from him"
"Then her response needs to be next level. Yes you could think with your junk and confront him, risking a situation neither of you can control, or she could threaten him with the law. Pretty sure that's harassment or indecent exposure etc.

Sure it's not as satisfying as getting in his face and defending your territory, but times have moved on and this way you get resolution and no criminal record. 

EDIT: She should at the very least block him on all social media. Even if she doesn't want to escalate it further."
Isn't she capable of handling it herself?
"I assume you're sleeping in the same bed.  Hair comes off and gets places. Happens all the time.  I've found her hair wrapped around my junk before.

I've had several guys randomly text me out of the blue. I've deleted them from my contacts and had no interest in talking to them again. Just had a guy I haven't talk to in over a year text me yesterday. It doesn't mean she did anything wrong.
"Marrying a girl that's extremely manipulating. Where she controls who you talk to, what you do, and belittles you all the time. Seen a lot of buddies who do what they believe is expected of them.

It's important to ask yourself if this relationship is healthy, are you overall happy, are you both treated as equals and respect each other. Take time to audit yourself and figure out what you want."

"I met her in college when I regularly would eat ravioli and speghettios straight out of the can without heating it up.

Or if I felt like ""cooking"" it would be an entire box of kroger mac n cheese. Sometimes I'd throw a can of tuna in it (which is surprisingly good, don't knock til you try). I'd take the pot off the stove, get a big spoon and eat all of it on the couch. 

I was broke in a shitty mouse infested apartment. The insulation was so bad it cost me 200 bucks to keep it at comfortable temperatures. So in winter I'd just wear my winter coat to bed to stay warm. Summers I'd just deal with the heat. She was broke too just in a slightly nicer place with a little support from her parents. I stayed at her place as much as possible.

After moving in together the finances were better. We moved to a nicer apartment and she insisted on cooking ""real food"". It was a good decision. 

Married now. Got a nice house. A little small but great for the two of us. And a pretty big yard. So I feel like we made it. Or at least we're *making* it.

"Social context is all that matters in determining how to modulate speech. In the old days, the presence or absence of women was an important aspect of social context. Nowadays, not so much. Women can be present just about any place, and so their presence in and of itself doesn't really provide an important cue about the level of formality of a given situation. 

Having said that, I only say the f-word under my breath when I am at the gym. But if someone else says that really loud, I might question their maturity a bit, but I'm not going to try to correct it. HOWEVER: if someone uses loud profanity with an intent to put down a person to their face, be they male, female, young, old, big, small...whatever, *THAT* I would have a problem with."

"I'm sorry for your loss. 

My father left our family and moved to another country when I was 14 and my little brother was 4, so I think I'm qualified. Here's a few pointers in no particular order

1. If he's crying because he wants something and it was denied from him (possible grammar mistake there), you should do your best to show sympathy but you absolutely should not give him anything to stop the crying. The sad truth is that with 90% of parents I've seen, crying is the golden key for their kid to get whatever they want. And then they complain that their kid cries all the time. Why wouldn't they if it works?

2. Humour is a really good way to bridge the gap between parent and friend, and teasing each other is a big part of that. But recognising when you've hit a nerve and apologising right away is very important, too. 

3. Don't lie to him pointlessly. If you're not buying him ice cream because he's had enough sweets, don't tell him the shop is closed. It doesn't help him, and it risks breaking his trust in you. It's not worth it, and frankly it's just a selfish way for you to avoid an argument about 'no I haven't had that many sweets'

4. Speaking of arguments, don't argue with him. Sometimes he can actually convince you that he hasn't had that many sweets, and that's when you gotta take a step back and see why you really denied him ice cream. But if you teach him that your decisions are debatable, he will nag and argue against every single thing he doesn't like. He doesn't know any better. 

5. Something I read on reddit, actually. ""Don't punish behaviour you want to see"". If he's usually shy about dancing and you see him dancing in some corner of the house, don't run up with a camera and make a big deal out of it. If he stays in his room a lot and you see him coming out, don't tease him about it . It's counterproductive. "

I thought I'd met the love of my life. We broke up a couple of months ago. I now find myself 35 and having to start all over again with meeting someone. It's going to suck. So I'd say my biggest dating struggle is finding the energy to get out there again.

"I call it ""retaliation spending"".  I see it a lot, especially in college couples.  One person in the relationship spends more money than they should on a non-essential thing, and so then the other person responds by spending more money they don't have on something they don't need."

"&gt;Should I try again for a date? What would you do?

I wouldn't date someone who had such little respect for other people's time that they don't even send out a courtesy text to let you know they can't make it.  Do you really want to make someone like that a priority in your life?"
"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"
"My friend from high school told me about the first time he did anal with his at the time gf. She didn't prepare in any way and ended up firing out built up diarrhea when he pulled out.

"Honestly, I believe it was luck and being in the right place. I ended up sleeping with a single mom who liked me. Then, 2 weeks later the place I volunteer at on weekends got a new girl and we hit it off right away. "

I'm fucking proud of you for pushing through all that. I hope you have a wonderful weekend.
"&gt; In all honesty, I'd stand by and see how my GF deals with it.

It's probably a good sign that she told him about it instead of keeping it a secret."
"Not currently my girlfriend. Unfortunately distance and my own mental inhibitions  messed it up. But I realized I loved her when I noticed I actually felt for her, which was completely new for me. The first time I kissed her, I felt it in my chest. When I went somewhere without her, I longed for her to be by my side. Her smile was infectious. Something as simple as walking down the street with her hand in mine was the greatest joy I'd ever experienced. When someone said or did something that hurt her, I would get legitimately angry. When we fell apart, I was crushed. Never before had I felt anything like that, nor since."
"1. I have actually done this.  
  
2. The onus is still on her to reschedule though. You don't know if she's made an excuse or is just scatterbrained. If she's scatterbrained she'll reschedule (even if she forgets to do it initially she'll get round to it eventually)  
  
So just move on but it's theoretically possible that you get a surprise. But just assume she was politely turning you down (although more polite would have been to not agree to a date she didn't want to go on)

"Yeahhhhh i really do think pornography has done people a disservice by not only implying that anal is a required part of every sexual relationship, but also seemingly suggesting that pristinely clean anal can happen at the drop of a hat without any preparation whatsoever.

Can i have a custom flair? Im asking nicely.
"She is foolish for asking that a week in. Isn't it enough that you try to spend a plurality of time with her? 

You can never take an emotional connection your SO has with someone else and make their emotional thing belong to you. He loves gaming with his friends, heisnt going to boot them out and game with you. 

Some people are just so selfish. A relationship is a beautiful thing where you more rapidly open up and get close faster because you've revealed your most closely guarded part of your body. And sure, it's exclusive sex. But that doesn't mean someone didn't work harder through other avenues already to get to that level of connection with them, which, by the way can happen without sex. 

Edit: plurality of free time "

"Sorry if this is a little off-topic, but I'm a woman supporting my SO through this phase now. In terms of ""expressing your gratitude,"" I wouldn't stress about that. In very economical terms, I plan to be with my SO, hopefully, forever, so this time is like an investment on my part. I believe that if I give him support now, he will reach his goals faster and we will be better off as a couple.

What it really boils down to is that I'm sticking through it because I want him to be happy. If he needs to be in a studio apartment living off ramen to do that, then okay. The ultimate reward for me will be to have a partner who feels fulfilled and lives without regret instead of someone who is unhappy and bitter."

"We've been there for a while and still kinda are but I wouldn't trade her for the world. We met as freshman in college and fell hard. Summer before senior year I went out to MA for a science internship and she got a last minute job in NYC to be close (comparatively when you are from the Midwest) her parents were pissed because they thoight it was unsafe and they refused to help her at all. She lived paycheck to paycheck off of 13.50 an hour living in a closet in brooklyn. She refused to let me buy her groceries when I visited (I did anyway and snuck them into her apartment).

 We talked a lot about our futures and eventually agreed we would put each other first, over our careers or anything else, but we would always work to make each others dreams a reality. She got accepted to TFA and I started applying to Graduate schools.  I went to college thinking about being a doctor but got really scared when I saw the application process my friends were going through and I didn't think I could do it so I started thinking Grad school would be easier. She asked me where she should preference for TFA and I told her one city where I thought I had the best chance, but I got only one offer from a completely different city. She offered to quit, but I told her i could always reapply in a few years. So I worked a shit job in city A to get experience instead. She asked me what I really wanted to do and I told her medicine and she said ""ok what do you need to make that happen"" and I said ""study my ass off and save a shitload of money"" and she more or less said ""then lets get fucking to it"". We paid off my student debt and saved a ton of money. We had a tiny wedding because all she really wanted to do was travel and she said where do you want to go and I said ""Italy"" and that's what we did. Every night after work she gave me space to study and I got a 513 MCAT and started applying to schools. Right now we are sharing an apartment with a roommate and scrounging food to save up enough for school. During all that time she wanted to go to law school and she told me she would make sure we would end up in the same city. She built an insane resume and destroyed the LSAT and we are going to start school in the same city this next year. The hard times are still to come, but we both know niether of us is going anywhere.

Edit: thanks so much everyone!"
"First things first.  Did she tell you about it, or did you discover it?"
"We'd been building up to a date and a pretty exciting fantasy for a while, and then her anxiety got the better of her a few hours before she was supposed to come over, and she had to cancel.

She felt awful, and like this had to be the last straw, the moment where I'd say I couldn't deal with her anxiety leading to cancelations or her not having enough bandwidth to make plans often in the first place.

I could sense it a bit too, like she was expecting this to be the end of it when we talked the next morning, and she explicitly gave me the ""I'll understand when this is too much.. "" line. But I knew in that moment that I wasn't going anywhere, and I sure as shit wasn't going to end something great over her needing to take care of herself first sometimes.

I don't recall the exact words I said to her in that moment, but she's said since that it was what finally broke through the intentional distance she was keeping in fear of hurting me, or herself, or both. She knew then that I loved her wholly, no matter her anxiety or anything else.

We were texting, and it was only maybe 30 seconds after I sent her my thoughts that she replied ""I love you"", and I said the same and then spent half an hour or so just sitting in my chair, stunned at how intensely I felt right then."

The fact that my girlfriend is an actress probably exacerbates this quite a bit but to be fair I felt that way before we were dating. "
Well that's certainly the nuclear option.
Think of a bar like a restaurant. Just tell them what you want. If you want a certain beer say the name of beer. Same thing for harder alcohol. You can be generic and say rum and coke but they'll usually give you whatever their house rum or whiskey (in the case of whiskey and coke) so there you may want to specify as well unless you don't care about the brand.
"I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion."

To that end, do whatever you can to make yourself interesting, and make yourself close to the person who you want to be. Pick up as many responsibilities as you can. Only good things will follow. "

"Got laid off in July in 2001. Met my wife in August. Economy tanked in September. In the next 36 months, spent 24 of them unemployed.

She stayed with me through all of it. Guess she saw where I would eventually end up or something. Anyway, while I was poor and broke, I bought her a pair of diamond studs. Just chips, really. Spent $75. You could barely see them in her ears. I told her they were diamond seeds, and if she loved them and watered them, they would grow.

For the next few years, for anniversaries, birthdays, whatever, a couple of times a year I would take the studs back from her, return to the jeweler, and upgrade them to a larger pair, spending 100 or so each time. They grew. I haven't upgraded them in several years, because once diamond studs get past a carat or so in each ear they get too big.

"I share when asked. I don't post pictures on social media, but she does. My parents are kept in the loop about what is going on.

Being in a monogamous relationship.
"I've done this a few times with a few different female friends. It's pleasant - even if you don't touch, there is a presence next to you and it's feminine, even if there is no sex or romance on the cards. It's just comforting and feels natural. I don't think that it would be the same with a male friend. I guess on some level a woman in your bed is still a woman in your bed, even if you see her as a friend and have no intentions. 

Honestly I think they felt the same. I think they were comforted by the warmth of a man next to them whom they felt they could trust."

I just wish that more of my dates and relationships with women were closer to that, I want someone else to lead for a change."
"If I‚Äôd asked myself if being hit during arguments was worth it. I ended up ruining the relationship through some of my actions, but if I had stood up to the physical abuse earlier, then I could‚Äôve ended it and moved on earlier and avoided a lot of things. 

"
That's a big goof
"If a girl hits you with that comment, you shouldn't take her out to dinner at all."
"To add to this, I don't think women really empathize just how difficult this ends up being.

When I was actively trying to date, I would get a date once every 3 to 6 months.  That's to get *one date*.  So you're putting in a large effort for the searching part, only to *hope* to get something in a span of 1/4 to 1/2 a year.  I have female friends and colleagues that get a date without doing anything within 1 month of breaking up with a guy.  Many, if they're *actively searching*, can get a date a week.

The *date itself* usually goes fine.  It's nervous and awkward usually, you find things to talk about, but for me this is the easy part.  Usually you find out you have nothing in common with the person.

But then you go back to searching for the 1-4 dates *a year* problem.

"Pretty good. 

Exclusively dated the girl I lost my virginity to for 3 years. At the age of 21 I realized I'd never had a chance to ""go wild"" or be single and ""figure myself out"". It was probably the hardest decision of my life but I broke up with her. Took a few months to get the hang of dating and talking to girls but I did ok for myself. More importantly I was able to do new things and push myself in new ways that I wouldn't have been able to while in a dedicated relationship. Fast forward to 27 and now I'm living in a different city that I love, I've traveled the world solo, made life-long friends, gone to crazy concerts and music festivals, had flings and hookups and a few shorter relationships in that time, really built on confidence in myself. I've been in a new serious relationship for about 6 months now and things are going great. She's an amazing, beautiful, smart and thoughtful woman who I never would have even had the confidence to talk to had I not gone through my single phase.

All that being said, being single can be lonely and dating these days is hard. While I feel everyone should be single for a long stretch in their adult lives to figure themselves out, it does get tiring.

TLDR; Overall pretty good, built confidence in myself, but also lonely. Ended up in a much better relationship anyway, but it took years of self-improvement to get there."

I have more money than her now, but I'm always grateful for that time. Granted, I've dated a few girls like this. The idea that girls care about money has never been true in my experience."

I‚Äôd been so content listening to her talk and keeping up with *her* conversation that it‚Äôd totally slipped past me that she had virtually no real interest in me or who I was at all. Never asked me questions, never paid much attention when I did have something to say, and always seemed to be just waiting for me to finish so she could launch into another monologue about herself. 

To add some context, these weren‚Äôt half-hour coffee dates. The first was a four hour picnic, the second a three hour lunch. And we were an hour or so into the third when it hit me that I was still basically an enigma to this girl and she couldn‚Äôt care less."

I didn‚Äôt really know where I was going in life at the time and what I wanted to do so I had no direction and instead of trying to find it, I just fucked around with my ex. It was fun and all but it didn‚Äôt help when we broke up and I felt lost. I just got into a new relationship and I‚Äôm trying to not let the same thing happen again now that I‚Äôm older. I know what direction I want to go in and while I love spending time with the girl, I made sure to let her know that I have to focus on some of my other goals at times and it‚Äôs nothing against her.

"Am woman, love honeydew.  Take your garbage opinion elsewhere."
"This has always been my problem but I think I have gotten much better.


I am much more polarizing with girls. I always just ask for their number, don't really chat much by text and ask them out right away for drinks or to watch a movie and drink at my place.


Many times they will say no, and I just move on or wait for them to make contact again.


Some will call me out for being too forward or say something like ""don't get the wrong idea, nothing will happen"". If they do come to my apartment, even after having said all this, we have sex.


Girls who want relationships won't bother with you and girls who just want to hook up want to do it but not feel like sluts. So you just don't talk about the fact that you don't want anything serious (unless she brings it up). Girls will read much more into what you do, rather than what you say. You just assume that if she goes directly to your place she wants sex.


Recently a girl who I went out with about 3 years ago and wanted a relationship with me then remarked about how much I have changed and ""don't give a fuck anymore"". Back then, I was super nice and gentlemanly with her and we never had sex. We went out many many times. A few weeks ago, I saw her at a bar, took her home and had sex right away. Now she is my friend with benefits and is completely ok with me dating other girls (and she does the same).

"Be fit to maximise your potential physical attractiveness. Have a life (hobbies and interests) and a rough idea of where you want your life to head to maximise other attractiveness.

Also you may have to lower standards. Might not be the case, but sometimes having too high standards can get in the way of finding a great mate. Human mating interactions have some market-like. And like any other market like exchange: you're not going to buy a $100 item if you have $10 to offer. But maybe there's a kickass $8 item that you could get."
"One, as others have said, is because **the ""obvious"" hints are often not**.  A lot of women really suck at flirting.  The whole point of plausible deniability is that if things don't work out, you can backpedal and pretend that you were never dropping hints at all.  Here's a solid benchmark to ask: is it something a male friend or female relative (inb4 broken legs reference) would do to a straight guy?  If so, it is probably not a hint worth anything.  Use your big girl words.

Two, **as much as the general societal trend is that men aren't really judged on looks, that simply isn't true**.  As much as there is a clear female physical ideal (decent-large perky breasts, narrow waist, wide hips, facial symmetry, clear skin, etc), there is just as much of one for men (6'-6'4, big arms, six or eight pack abs, generally solid muscle definition, defined cheek/jaw, larger than average penis).  Women's appearance is generally more focused on because selling stuff to women is more profitable (women spend a LOT more than men).  Men get told they're unattractive as much as women do, and it hurts men's self-esteem just as much.

Three, **although there is a stigma about women voicing their attraction to guys, no such stigma exists for voicing their unattraction to guys**.  I know many a woman who is very reserved about saying that she finds someone attractive, but will gladly turn around and tell a guy that he is a manlet, fat, looks creepy, ugly, gross, and other such things.  A lot of guys don't get positive affirmations of their appearance, but will have plenty of insults thrown their way.  Ask me how I know this.

When you get told you're unattractive, fat, ugly, etc for the majority of your formative dating years, it sticks.  It takes a *long* time and a lot of positive reinforcement to undo that mentality.  I've read many times on here about a girl voicing an attraction to a guy, only for the guy to take it as being made fun of.  While this sounds stupid, it usually isn't without precedent.  It is extremely well known that confidence is attractive, and there are a lot of guys who are not as confident with women as their appearance might suggest.

I'm almost 27, and I've basically just started at the point where I accept that there are girls who are genuinely attracted to me.  Self-esteem is key, and people are their own worst critics."
"Not a great idea. If this is the kind of shitweasel who sends dick pics to a girl he knows is in a relationship, then he's the kind who wouldn't be afraid to post OP's dick pic online."

"I've had this happen to me few times over the many years of dating.  It's frustrating, but there's not a simple yes/no answer to this situation.  It all really depends on what the actual relationship is like so far.

Is this someone you just met on Tinder or at the bar last week?  If so, I honestly wouldn't put much more effort into it.  I'm not saying shut her down right away, but don't be proactive about keeping in touch or reaching out.  If you feel her putting in a lot of effort to make up for mistake than you maybe you can consider a change in attitude.

But if this is someone you've been texting/talking to on a daily/semi-daily basis and you feel like she's really into you, give her the benefit and try and arrange for another time.

Ultimately, don't exert more energy into this than necessary.  You have plenty of other more productive avenues to use that energy on..."

"On the second date with a girl, we ended back at her place, and she eventually told me extensively how she liked to get guys to humiliate themselves in front of her, for instance the guy who works at the tire store across the street who she will call up and have him jump through tires on command. After some making out, she extended her foot and told me to lick her boot. I asked ""why?"" and she said ""for pussy"". I wasn't feeling that, so we chilled for a while longer, then she disappeared to the bathroom, and was gone forever, so I went to look for her and found her naked and face down on her bed, sleeping (I thought). I was kind of glad for the out, so silently left. I texted her a polite thanks for the evening, looks like you were tired so I left, and right away got a text back: you should have came in and raped me while I was sleeping. Um...needless to say, there was no third date."

'Babe?'....fuckin stop clapping across the bridge this is a private moment...is she really crying? Holy shit...""

That implies that she knew she was bailing but didn‚Äôt have the decency to cancel before you showed up to meet her. Also, she didn‚Äôt offer to reschedule or make it up to you in anyway.

"I thought standard operating procedure was to start putting food in your butt 48 hours in advance, so you start pooping out your mouth.  Avoiding the problem altogether???"
"I think I can speak for my SO on this one also, but at the beginning of our relationship, we had just both gotten out of a relationship and we both knew we both weren't really ready for another.  If we had honestly just told ourselves that we had to stop doing what we were doing (i.e., seeing each other every day, talking every day, doing things together, etc), we would have quit our 'relationship' at the time and tried to remain friends.  To be honest, I wouldn't have been able to just be friends.  This was the girl I had dreamed about for years upon years and the reason we had a falling out before was because I had strong feelings for her and I couldn't remain friends with her, especially since she was in a relationship at the time.  This time, it would've been even harder because I still had strong feelings, even stronger now that we were essentially back together at a different level, and we couldn't take the next step.  We both knew it was best to stay separated for a while or try to remain as friends...

But, as I'm typing this, I'm glad we didn't do that.  It's been quite a ride, but I'm glad we stuck this through and everything has been great ever since.  I love this girl so much and out of all my relationships, this is the one that I truly hope and wish will go the distance.  "

"I'll speak for my father:

Backstory:

After knowing my mother since pre-school, 40 years of marriage, a massive income generated by my mother that lead to a DOPE ass retirement nest egg (talking eight digits), 2 kids and 2 grandchildren he decided he'd try his luck on backpage.  Ended up raw dogging some chick, got spooked and took an STD/AIDS test from the local clinic.  My mom discovered it randomly searching for a lighter in a drawer one day (junk drawer, because he's a fucking dipshit) and his entire seedy past came to a head; porn subscriptions, thousands spent on cam whores, more money spent on a side chick that was my age (32) with two kids that are my chidrens' age.  Turned out he was leading an insane double life filled with swingers clubs, random old dude young chick gang bangs etc, all this insane shit I'd never expect him to do, after all he was a dopey guy for most of my life who just enjoyed golfing and being great at having diabeetus.

He told my mother that they'd already done the normal marital life and sex stuff and he wanted to bang other people. She didn't, no surprise, she was never an overly affectionate person.  They tried marriage counseling, that didn't work, and then he straight up asked my mother if they could remain married while he got his dick wet--that didn't fly.

They divorced, he basically went into some bizarre sex filled seclusion, i found out about all of it after the divorce started and my wife, sister and BiL were left to pick up the pieces that were my mother.  She spent her entire life climbing the corporate ladder to build a better life for her, my dad and her family.  Kinda sad, she missed out on a big piece of my sister and me growing up.  The fallout was pretty intense.  

Fast Forward:

I'd say he's enjoying it, maybe, but i bet he's pretty sad and depressed.  He essentially gave up his entire family to fuck people.  I haven't spoken to him in 2 years, he never reaches out except for holidays and my kids b-days talking about weird ""i still love you stuff"" like i'm an 8 year old trapped in the middle of a custody battle, I'm 32.  He thinks my kids remember him, but they don't, I don't really have the urge to tell him.  Personally, we were never that close, maybe he thought we were but I always thought he was a buffoon and creepy.  Sometimes it is a bit weird, as a father, to think that I'd reach a point in my life that I could walk away from my wife and kids, especially my kids, and only put in less than minimum effort to make contact. 

He's never changed his email password since 2001, occasionally I'll log into it to see what he's doing out of curiosity and it's pretty weird.  Mostly because there's people out there willing and ready to meet up and fuck my dad.  Maybe there's some truth to the ""hot and ready singles"" ads.

Life is strange. Kinda hope he dies soon, there'd be closure for everyone.  Sometimes I think it would be better if he died before any of this came out, at least for my mother's sake.

"Lol, well-played. 

But, no, that‚Äôs how long it took to find out who posted it.

It was even stuck to my lips.‚Äù

"If the mud turns red, seek medical attention."
"We were best friends and she tried to convince me to date her for over a year. We had to sit down and talk about it about once a month and I‚Äôd have to say again ‚ÄúI do not want to date you‚Äù pretty much every single month. I would tell her that she needed to get her feelings in check or we couldn‚Äôt be friends, and she‚Äôd apologize and swear she was fine and wasn‚Äôt going to bring it up again.

I finally realized that I was never going to end the friendship because I really couldn‚Äôt imagine life without her. So then I started seriously thinking about dating her. Then the company I was working for went under and I got a job offer in a different state, in my dream job. When I realized I didn‚Äôt want to move away from her, I decided to man up and treat her right.

It was weird at first to go from BFFs to a relationship, and our first kiss was THE most awkward thing ever. We both cringe when we think about it. Because it was just totally forced.

It was after we sat down at Applebee‚Äôs and talked about what we wanted the relationship to look like and agreed on rules and boundaries for it, then I took her home and she was so happy. I‚Äôm not going to just not kiss her, we‚Äôre in a relationship now, right? So we feel super uncomfortable but we go in for the kiss anyways and both pretend to enjoy it. Lol......if anyone actually reads this far, I apologize for the cringe.

The first few weeks were weird, there were some days that I second-guessed myself, but I had taken an entire month to make sure I was making the right decision, so I wasn‚Äôt going to go back on it.

I fell in love with her. I really did. She‚Äôs absolutely nuts. All of her bad qualities that I knew about before we dated haven‚Äôt changed. This woman has the most intense, awful, apocalyptic periods ever. We did some research and have her taking some natural remedies that balance out your mood swings when you‚Äôre on your period, and it helps so much, but she‚Äôs still insane when she‚Äôs on her period. She knows it.

I treat her well, though. We care about each other a ton, and I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better partner to help me through crap. She‚Äôs got health issues and requires a lot of special care, but I love being able to be the one she depends on. She puts up with me when I‚Äôm slow and dumb (like taking a year to get around to dating her) and she laughs at my stupid jokes. She‚Äôs a great cook and she has so many strengths that I don‚Äôt. She‚Äôs amazingly organized and has great self-discipline. I‚Äôm the messiest piece of shit you‚Äôve ever seen, and my memory is so bad that I have to write literally everything down in a notebook.

I don‚Äôt know why she loves me and puts up with me, but she does. She completely changed me. I was a total playboy, but I only have eyes for her. We‚Äôre the perfect fit for each other.

"I think most are just saying they *don't* care about whether or not a woman is fit, they just want her to be thin or not fat. "
For me it's low self esteem and poor self image. People have told me I am very good looking and attractive. But I don't feel it inside so it just doesn't occur to me that anyone would find me attractive. 
"*I don't get why creepy men always think I'm flirting when I'm just being friendly?!*

Because you were being flirty because you like the attention.  Quit being attention whores and doing this to people. "

"Alright Johnny, I've got some personal experience in dealing with this, and then some a little professional. 

The reality is that right now, you're young, you don't have life experience and you're being told some generic advice on repeat that doesn't really help you at all. Being told to ""follow your passion"" is great once you've had time to lock that down, but the reality is there are many adults out there well into their forties and beyond who still have no idea what that is. 

Instead, you need to take a step back and make a few personal decisions. 

*What kind of person do I want to be?*
*What sort of legacy do I want to want to leave behind?*, and
*How much am I willing to sacrifice to achieve these things?*

These days, a lot of kids (particularly in the West) [grow up with this notion that they are special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hER0Qp6QJNU). Our parents and their grandparents endured some incredible hardships including a World War, Vietnam, the Cold War, 9/11, the GFC, the list goes on. Society says that our parents worked hard to give us a better future, and in many cases this is true - I know my parents did. But, what that future means was never clear, for them *opportunity*, simply meant 'better'. This translated to the idea that all children of this generation are special, and are able to achieve greatness. It also came with a shitload of expectation and pressure to go out there and do something straight away and make good on what we were promised, even if we didn't necessarily ask for it. 

So right now? *Just do something*. If you have passions, that is fantastic. Make the time to continue developing these, let them becomes central to who you are and don't let go of them. Immerse yourself in these hobbies; do you play an instrument but don't want to go into music as a career? Doesn't matter - make it a [side hustle](https://startupnation.com/start-your-business/chris-guillebeau-side-hustle-school/) to earn some cash. Video games? That one is a little tougher, but use them as wind down time, I certainly do. Fitness? For god's sake, don't ever lose this. 29 year old Johnny will thank you. Don't just keep doing what you're doing though - [make the effort to learn](https://ss.fitness/) as much as you can and improve your approach to it - not only will you improve physically, but also mentally. Technology? This one is easy, it is constantly evolving, and the future is ripe for those willing to engage with it.

You're in community college right now and it is fantastic that you're giving it a go. Despite being unsure of where the future leads, stick at it, because an [education is an investment in yourself](http://dariusforoux.com/best-investment-decision/) and most likely the best investment you will ever make. This goes hand in hand with getting involved beyond the basics of community college. Network with your peers and academics, get to know their stories and engage with what they have to offer. Who knows - you might find people who are where you are and could use a little guidance or a friend themselves. One of the best mentors I could have ever found happened this way, and I've been better for it ever since. 

The point is, a lot of people expect opportunity to fall into their lap, or simply wait for it to come along. The reality though is very different. Opportunities come along to those who take action, and I promise you they will appear whether you are expecting them or not. If you are willing to take the time to simply *engage* beyond the minimum and develop your hobbies, network and studies through your own agency, doors will open *simply because you are already opening them* even if that isn't your primary goal.

My hobby is planning to take up a hobby. I‚Äôve been doing it for years now. 
"1. I brew beer which I don't see too many women taking on as a hobby.  I also brew wine and cider which I think appears a good deal less manly.

2. Yeah.  What comes to mind most was a girl who tried to give me shit because I cook.  I just laughed in her face.  If you want to eat good food you have to make good food and people love my blueberry muffins.  I also dismissed her when she tried to claim I don't know how to season food because I'm white.

3.  I protected a stray kitten way back in middle school at a sports camp.  All the guys were trying to get the director's kid to kick it.  I got some pretty nasty looks and comments for that one but fuck if I'll let anyone hurt kittens.

4. I don't think I've ever heard that phrase used in a constructive way.  It always feels like a weasel word for when the rest of the argument makes no sense.  I deal with the phrase as little as possible and the few people who I've heard use it in person I avoid like the plague.  Better safe than sorry."

"I'm female. 
I began dating a man after coming out of an abusive relationship. He was super sweet and kind, I found to be a bit of a 'pushover'. 
One evening we had a mild disagreement over something, who knows what, I asserted dominance by standing over him and screamed, ""Fuck you!""

He very calmly stood up and said, ""I understand you had a bad relationship before me. I am not him. I will not tolerate you treating me the he treated you. It's not good for either of us. I will not be your 'kick me dog' and you will never say those words to me again.""

He stood up and left. 

In that moment, I grew up. I was 25 years old and realized/learned that boundaries are important in order to have a healthy relationship.  

We had several more months together, eventually realized we were on two different paths and called it quits. 

Fast forward 2 years. My Grandfather died. He showed up with his very pregnant wife to pay his respects and offer me support. 

He was so sad for me. I was so happy for him. I called him a slut for moving so fast. We laughed. He had his dream and I was genuinely happy for him and his wife. I sent gifts when their daughter was born. 

It only took me a decade to find my permanent love. But, I needed to move slowly and be sure and trusting of my partner. Always remembering the lesson I learned. Don't be mean, and don't allow anyone to be mean to you. No need to fight; just a simple, firm statement, ""I will not tolerate being your 'kick me dog'."""
You sound like me. Im reading all these comments and wondering where these men get the time. I have a pretty strict schudel and im not sure i want to gice it up to knock boots.
"Hey I'm a medical student. The good news is that you don't have to wait for effective contraception. Long-term reversible contraceptives (the implant and hormonal IUDs) are actually more effective at preventing pregnancy in the long run than [getting your tubes tied at an early age is](http://www.upmc.com/patients-visitors/education/contraception/Pages/tubal-ligation.aspx). Unfortunately the most common tubal ligation procedure has a risk of about 5% failure in 10 years from women who get it under the age of 28, but the hormonal [IUD and implant has less than a 2% risk](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1110855), and you don't need a major surgery!

"Been skinny my whole life. I have 2 responses based on how much of a smart ass I want to be. If I'm lazy I just go with ""I hadn't noticed"" or something similar. If I want to put in the effort, I open my eyes really wide (in surprise) extend my arms and examine them intensely then just start muttering things like ""oh...oh my god.... I think... I think I need to see a doctor..."" I would not do the latter in a professional setting "
"We broke up due to unfortunate circumstances.  Neither of us wanted to and I haven't found a girl close to her amazingness since.  Going to preface that now.  

The point I realized I was in love with her was when I was having a really hard time and was sulking, which is pretty fucking rare for me, and she came over, squared my shoulders, picked my head up, and said I was the strongest and most persevering person she had ever met and that I can't let what was going on affect me because I'm better than that and I will get through it; she'll make sure she's there for me in case I decide I can't, she'll prove I can.  I've never felt another person's presence pierce me as hard as she did in that moment.  I realized then that I was basically head over heels for her haha.

That stuck with me and whenever I feel like shit or I can't do something, I remember what she said and I pick my head right back up.  Powerful shit that it's stuck with me for so long."

"Wise words from my mother: ""Girls are stupid.""

Extended wise words from my mother:

""When you're taken, girls know that you're safe to be around. They know you won't try hitting on them or trying to flirt, they feel like they can trust you. But, they see you making that other girl happy and they ask themselves, '*what does she have that I don't? Why does she get to be happy? What does he find so attractive in her? What's wrong with me?*' But when you're single, they look at you as some creep who likes them, and there must be something wrong with you because no girl is dating you. In other words, if you're taken, they want to know why you're not taken by them. If you're single, then obviously there's something wrong with you. Girls are stupid."""
Did Confucius say that?
Woah. 2Real4Me. 
"&gt; Be fit to maximise your potential physical attractiveness.

People hate advice like this, but it‚Äôs true. Generally when someone says they‚Äôre unattractive, they‚Äôre also admittedly not doing the best they can with the tools they‚Äôve been given. Personally, a fit body with a below average face is 100x better than a cute chubby chick, because it shows dedication to self-improvement, and her positive quality is something she created. It wasn‚Äôt a gift."

"The bigger issue is that the term ""creep"", socially, it's so close to being one step off something far more sinister, yet some women think it's okay to just throw around like it's oxygen.

"Because they‚Äôre kinda like art in a museum..

Normally you‚Äôre not allowed to touch the art, or in some cases play with the art.

However if you‚Äôre lucky enough, the owner of the museum may think you‚Äôre special enough that they‚Äôll let you touch the art later on when the museum is closed.

The idea of that alone is just really nice. "

"Probably because they're generally associated with sex, which we enjoy very much.

You don't (usually) go to work every day and see a girl walking around in a thong with her tits out. I can speak from experience and say when I was working around strippers constantly it was significantly less arousing to see a random ass or some tits.

Now that I no longer work around strippers on a regular basis they've both regained their appeal, as I usually only see them when I'm about to get some."

"+1 on the ignoring part.

The stereotype ""men are oblivious"" stems from the fact that most of us *ignore* these signs, not that we don't notice and are oblivious to them. 

The issue is that women who use these signs might all have different intentions: some might just be friendly, some might be flirty but might not have any intentions outside of that, and others might just simply be attracted to us.

Because of that, sometimes just simply ignoring signs is less trouble than approaching somebody unless they're showing direct intentions."

"She was my first real girlfriend.

We were 16 years old.

She was a pretty little blond, and when we met we would leave our respective houses and walk to meet midway. Almost 6 months into the relationship, I went to meet her one day and when I saw her coming down the street, I couldn't stop grinning, I thought my face would split, she was smiling back, and my spirits soared at sight of her. I knew then.

That was in August of 1971.

We've been married 41 years.

Still in love.
