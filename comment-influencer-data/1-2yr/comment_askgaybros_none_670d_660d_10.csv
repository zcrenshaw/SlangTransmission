Congrats man, hopefully you have many more."

"* AXE deodorant. Blekh. 
* Dirty talk that feels forced and awkward.

WELL THIS IS FUCKING ADORABLE 
"Oh man.  Once again I find I'm going to bed when I see a thread I want to say a lot on.  Oh well.

I'll just say this: being a ""slut"" or whatever is fine...as long as it is what you want *and* you don't get trapped in that phase.  I'm 40 and I see a TON of older gay men who have spent the last 20 years sleeping around but they are stuck. They keep wondering why they can't find something ""real"" and it is because they have become addicted to the high of easy sex...for decades.  These people often end up very lonely and very hollow inside. 

Just be careful.  

It's a very, very real trap gay men fall into without realizing it until a great deal of their life has already passed them by. 

(Dad talk over lol.  No really: my son is gonna wake up way too early for me to be typing on here. Have a good night!) "
Good. He sounds like a piece of shit anyways. 
"Because the ugly ones don't register as gay to them.

I feel similarly when hot straight guys talk about how great it must be to be gay because they get hit on by guys all the time and gay guys get to hook up with everyone. I'm like, yes, it would be very fun...for you, a hot masculine dude. Doesn't work that way for a lot of us."
"Yes, it's unfair, and if a 16-year-old boy was texting a 23 year old guy the shit would be hitting the fan.
"
"Yes, and ""like"" isn't a strong enough word.
"
"An extensive instagram - just makes you look narcissistic and makes me think that you're not actually enjoying whatever it is you're doing.

Landscape shots and the like are excusable but if it's just continuous photos of you sitting on a fence drinking rose with captions like ""You only persevere forward after you look backward"" then nah... 

Doesn't matter how pretty you are you look like a tool"
Because people who support such theories are not really the best with logics.

"No, respecting someone as a person and being their friend doesn't mean you owe them sex."
"It's awesome but for non-Australians, this was just a survey, not a binding vote. In fact we have conservatives in power and many believe that they did this with the hopes the No vote would succeed... and they knew that even if the Yes vote succeeded, they could simply debate it forever and never pass anything.

Australians generally believe they should have just passed the law without a useless $120mill survey."
"If I was Australian, I'd be so pissed about this vote. It just seems like a lose lose. They can ignore it if it's in favor of gay marriage, and if it's against they can just use it to support discrimination. Minority rights shouldn't be up to a public vote. "
"I have basically no life, but also a boyfriend, so that gives me little bit of a life.

I just work in retail at Target, and when I‚Äôm not doing that I sit at home and watch YouTube or play League of Legends. That‚Äôs basically my life, which I‚Äôm pretty comfortable with."

"Ok this is adorable and before people are assholes to you bc internet anonymity:

1. You're 14 and you got a hopefully 14ish yo date. You are clearly not too ugly for your date and that is what matters

2. Be normal talk to him like you're a friend. Do you have any common interests? Talk about those

3. Just go for it. If he doesn't want to hold hands, he'll shake your hand off. In that case, accept it and move on. It's probably not personal. Some dudes aren't comfortable holding hands in public, some are, especially in high school.

4. If you must wear cologne, spray it twice in the air and walk through it. Do not under any circumstance spray cologne directly on yourself. You want scent to be discovered, not announced. If you have Axe or something, just avoid it and go with the fresh shower and deodorant combo.

5. Have fun. Make sure your hygiene is on point. Don't sweat it. If he's an adult, do not do anything regrettable and make sure someone knows where you are and check in with them and do not get in his vehicle and go anywhere after. This is probably not your case, but I was a bad kid @14 and got into plenty of trouble. Good luck!"
"not just that, if it was a 23yo guy and a 16yo girl shit would also be hitting the fan. 

Generally if an older male has sex with a younger male/female it's ""creepy"" But if a younger male gets an older female, they are a fucking man and super badass with a hot older woman."

That‚Äôs so creepy
"Uhm, I'm still bothered your mother asked you that and it took you threatening to leave for her to challenge her boyfriend's bs."

"Spending all day at the gym, taking all kinds of unnatural supplements, and getting awkwardly big muscles.

Yes exercise is important to health and we should all do it. And yes some muscles are sexy. But the focus on muscle size over actually being healthy is pretty stupid, in my opinion. "
I‚Äôm so happy right now and I don‚Äôt even live in Australia! 
"Aaah yes, passive-aggressive multiple choice. I play it often.

Him: ""I'm hungry. What do you want to do for dinner?""
Me: (Choice A) I'd like chicken for dinner.
Him: *screws up face* ""I don't want that.""
Me: ""Oh OK, what would you like?""
Him: ""I don't know. You choose.""
(He really does know. He just won't say it because he knows it's something I dislike.)
Me: ""OK, well, I'm going to have chicken. If you'd like some you're welcome to join me.""
Him: ""What, noooo. I just don't want chicken.""
Me: *pinches nose* ""Fine. What do you want then?""
Him: ""Would you like a kebab?""
(Note that he still can't come out and say ""I want"". PA to the max.)
Me: ""Fine. Let's have kebabs.""

Every. Damn. Night. Other strategies involve him wandering around the kitchen opening and closing the fridge door, or asking if I want him to take out some random piece of food for dinner."
"Honestly I don't see what's wrong with that though. I mean if someone is going around and saying negative stuff about feminine gay guys and saying that they're somehow less than other gay guys that's one thing. But simply not being attracted to them isn't really a diss or anything, it just means that they don't find you attractive, which is something everyone deals with, masculine or feminine. "
Aww that's nice!! I hope you have a great first date. 
"nah

what depresses me is how openly straight men can let a woman know they're interested. at work, at school, at the store, anywhere. she turns you down, whatever. you won't remember after next week cause straight + available women are everywhere. she's a lesbian, whatever. ha ha funny story to tell the boys next time.

i don't think it just always works that way for gays who aren't obviously gay. i see the guy of my dreams at work, at school, at the store, anywhere... and all i can do is think ""if only"". chances of a guy being gay are already low, couple that with the chances of a guy being gay AND finding me attractive aaaaand there's basically no point in trying lol. getting rejected pales in comparison to the risk of guys reacting negatively or violently, something that straight guys don't have to worry about with women.

it's a bit depressing to think that out of the thousands of strangers i've fawned over, maybe one of them found me attractive and wondered about me too. maybe one of them never said anything or approached me for the same exact reasons i never said anything or approached them. maybe we could have lived the best years of our young lives together instead of alone dreaming about love if one of us had just said hi."

"This is not a gay-specific problem so much as it is a sexist problem. You have a 23 year old girl sexting with a possibly underaged teenager, and the action is praised because everyone expects the teenage boy to ""score."" If it was a 23 year old man sexting with ANYONE, whether a girl or a boy, he'd be roundly condemned and the recipient of his affections would be shamed."
He says it all the time. 90% of the time I like it. 10% I would appreciate some input.
"I don't know if any of these are considered weird and these don't happen a lot but:

* When they're too concentrated on something like a titration in a lab, a calc problem, porn, a cute dog, driving, whatever that they don't realize how hot they look doing it.
* When they do something involving raising their hands to the point that the treasure trail/v-line/pelvic area is exposed.
* When they have that after workout/running smell.
* Adorable clumsiness that looks cute/hot at the same time like falling on their butt or dropping something.
* Wearing glasses/lab goggles.
* Messy/bed hair.
* When you catch them looking at you and they catch you looking at them and you both look away so you're both creeps for doing that so there's some awkward sexual tension which makes you embarrassed but there's satisfaction inside since you caught him regardless."
"Aww this makes me so happy. At 14 I was in the closet and even if I was out, going on a date with a guy just wouldn't have happened. It's awesome that kids nowadays feel comfortable enough to be themselves and date whoever they want. Congrats :)"
"I had a manager like this, he didn‚Äôt last long. He kept hiring young, blond, attractive guys who were straight out of high school and had no experience or training. "

"How I know I am gay:

1) Men sexually arouse me; My dick become hard when I look at them, feel them, interact with them etc. (the nice, friendly, cute and hot ones of course). No type of woman ugly, cute or hot can sexually arouse me. If they touch me or show off their body in just bras and thongs, it does absolutely nothing for me. I'm not sexually aroused whatsoever. My body and mind doesn't respond sexually to it. 
2) When I see gay marriage proposals I become overwhelmed with emotion and I feel that this is something I 100% absolutely want for myself someday. I want to be with the man of my dreams because it feels so right and genuine.  I'm a pretty stoic guy and don't feel much happy emotions because of anxiety and depression. This, however, makes me forget about it in the moment.
3) I love joking and flirting with guys,  gay or straight. I tend to do it unintentionally without realizing. 
4) You feel safe, sound and protected with another man.

Not surprising.  I assume a poll of straight women would show similar results.
Me. A life without a boy to cuddle is no life at all.
"**""How do you get over the feeling of worthlessness after finding out boyfriend of two years was cheating?""**

This is simple. You need to accept that you were wrong. 

You assumed he felt the same way that you did, and he did not. He has poor impulse control, and isolates his feelings instead of sharing them. He chose to walk out on the relationship rather than do the work to fix it. 

The bad: You got hurt. He will continue to be insincere, and will hurt others. 


the good: You are free to pursue a real connection with someone who is ready to share themselves (really all of themselves) even if it hurts. 

Relationships are hard, people cheat rather than face the truth that while they are attractive enough to get someone who doesn't know them well to sleep with them, they don't have enough maturity to treat someone well enough to sustain a long term relationship. They don't see their own mistakes and that is painful, so they move on. 

**He didn't cheat on you because of who you are, he cheated because it was easier to get sex from a stranger than grow into a good boyfriend and be real with you.**"
"This is so awesome. 14 year old me was sucking closet dick cause that was the only real option. So happy to see that some gay teens are getting to have healthier more typical developmental experiences and live the life all their straight friends are.

 "
"If he's attractive, and willing to splurge on an expensive dinner, I'd totally be down. "
"No. 

If you weren't roommates, I'd say it *might* be a good idea, that would depend on many things. But NEVER fuck your roommates. Not unless you're prepared to live with a lot of awkwardness should he decline or if either of you feel weird about it after the fact or if you two become an item briefly before realizing you're not compatible. There are many ways this can play out and almost ALL of them end with your home life sucking and possibly even being forced to move...

"
Awh
So that I can shamelessly eye fuck him the entire time I'm with him.
Huge fucking improvement! It's really nice to see someone actually put in the effort to change the things they don't like about their looks instead of just whining and calling others shallow.

"Your prudish, sanctimonious attitude about other people's sex lives. I'm not impressed that you don't use Grindr nor that you haven't had sex since your last relationship ended, and I sure as hell don't care to listen to you shame people who are a lot more casual with their sexuality."

"I think it really depends. Sometimes they can be nice. But if someone introduces themselves by showing their asshole to you, it's less ""wow that's hot"" and more ""hey you're introducing yourself like a cat, that's gross."""

"I grew up in the 90s in India with access to two TV channels. There was no real conception of what it meant to be gay, no visible role models that I could look up. 

I remember feeling attracted to men from a very early age. One of my first sexual memories is as a 7 or 8 year old. I was watching wrestling at a friend's house, the only one in our neighborhood that had cable. Out walked Razor Ramon, with his slicked back locks and his many many gold chains. Watching him preen in all his glory filled me with the strangest oddest desire. Not knowing what to do with it, I remember wishing he were my father, wishing he'd hold me in his lap and press my head against his chest. Once I discovered masturbation, I'd jerk off to cartoon heroes and villains. The Punisher was a favorite.

Somehow, while all this was going on, I was still able to feel a faux attraction for girls in my class. I became really good friends with this one girl. I knew she really liked me. I really liked her too. Part of me always knew my feelings for her were not the same. I tried pushing her away, but she kept persisting. When I was 21, in a moment of loneliness, I asked her out. We dated for a month. I couldn't even bring myself to kiss her. I wanted to. Fuck if I didn't. But I couldn't. I came up with the lamest excuse for breaking it off. But I still would not admit to myself the real reason, let alone confess it to her.

In retrospect, it all sounds so ridiculous and obvious, and I will forever carry some guilt for leading her on. But the brain is capable of such incredible delusion, it's scary. I refused to acknowledge my masturbatory habits. I'd jerk off, feel guilty for a little while, and then repress what had just happened, until I was horny again.

I finally came out to myself a month after I left the country, at 22. I'd just moved to Berkeley. A friend from undergrad, who was in Austin at the time, came over for a long weekend. At some point, I got dragged to a strip club. I got a lap dance, as one final act of desperation. Did absolutely nothing for me. That was the last straw. 

Marched my ass to the Castro the next weekend, got drunk, started making small talk with this handsome older man sitting down from me at the bar. We're buying each other drinks, his friends join in, everybody's being really flirty. At some point, there was a pause in the conversation, we're staring at each other, and it just made sense to kiss. We did. It was long and it was beautiful

You know how I really knew I was gay? Because it felt so incredibly natural to kiss another man. I knew exactly what I was doing, though I'd never so much as even seen gay porn. I haven't looked back since. 

Your wife deserves to feel that way as much as you do. You may think you're doing her a favor now, but you really aren't. Sorry for the wall of text, but hopefully there's something in there that inspires you to come out.

Best luck!"

"I pretty much exclusively bottom, and from my experience the more tense you are the more uncomfortable it is. I honestly do my best to just relax and enjoy the pleasure of it, it helps having a top you can trust to help relax you and take it slow.

My only advise is to keep your emotions in check, I am not saying dont look forward to the date, just focus on having a good time rather than thinking of him as the 'the one'.

The first person I dated, I let my emotions get the better of me and it didn't end well for me. I invested too much emotionally after only a few dates because I was so worried about everything going well and I didn't want to lose him. Of course, it had the opposite effect than what i intended. 

If things go well, that is great, but also know there are other great guys out there if things dont go well. You have tons of options, no matter what happens.

Good luck!

As a POC I definitely have my own internalized racism about men of my own race and a distinct ""preference"" against them. But I've been on both sides of that equation. The lack of response or the stereotype about big cocks definitely hurts over time and makes you feel undesired. I've also totally caught myself dismissing men or assuming they will be dominant or submissive or whatever because of their race. So if it's not racist, what is? If that makes you uncomfortable, you might want to ask yourself whether bias and privilege have anything to do with it."

finding out they're straight does it almost every time.

"If the sex doesn't go well, it could get REALLY awkward for you both later. Sex can screw up friendship and roommates. But careful."
This doesn't change my opinion.
"For all the snowflakes who are so distraught over the idea that prejudice and discrimination is systemically present in all aspects of society, most POC complaining about this isn‚Äôt saying that people should just throw away their preferences and sleep with everyone. 

All we want is for people to recognize that it is a problem. That we ALL do have an inherent amount of prejudice and bias when we attempt to hook up, date, etc. We know that just telling people to suck it up and sleep with a black person or Asian person isn‚Äôt going to solve this‚Äîwe‚Äôre not idiots. But failing to even acknowledge that this problem exists is reason the reason why inclusivity and diversity will continue to be a problem in the gay community. 

As someone who is a POC, I just want people to recognize that we get barely any representation in mainstream media. You go on tumblr blogs or instagrams of hot gay guys, you mostly see white guys or light skinned Latinos unless you specifically mention their race. And even in those circumstances, we‚Äôre fetishized. There‚Äôs a reason why white people are worshipped as the common standard of beauty. "
"You can't tell everyone this. Or you shouldn't.

If I find this out from you, I will mercilessly suck your nipples until your balls are empty and aching. I would treat you like a science experiment."
"i don't mind daddy sometimes but yeah, bussy is a word that should be thrown out completely."
"More like 1 in a thousand. Assuming 50% of the population are men, 5% of those are gay, 25% of those are in your age range, 50% are people you find physically attractive, 50% are people you're socially/romantically compatible with, and 66% are compatible with you in terms of sexual role, you're looking at 0.103% of the population. And those estimations are pretty generous imo"
You found the magical unicorn!
"When I met my partner's parents I did everything I could to have them like me. I felt it was important to have them accept me into their family. That's one side of it. 

Not to the same extent as you describe, but I got along really well with his dad. We like scotch, cars, etc. It was awesome for me as I really wasn't that close with my own father. 

You should talk to your boyfriend but realize that it's probably an innocent reason (like the two examples above). 

My two cents. "
"Bottom half fish, assuming that you mean the human half is from the pelvis upwards.

You could kill the merman, and use the bottom half as an easy source of food. Tons of cookable and smokeable meat on the latter portions of the fish.

As well, the flesh from the top half could be utilized as bait for fish if need be, or just as food. The lungs could provide use as caryable water sacks.  The long bones from the arms, as well the ribs, could be sharpened and made into weapons to hunt with. The skull could be used as a digging tool, or as a makeshift cup if need be. Visceral organs would serve as a good source of bait for seabirds or land based animals. 

If my memory of human physiology is right, you could do some sort of rudimentary fulid purification using the tissues of the liver and kidneys.

Finally, the large and small intestines would be useful as cordage for all manner of things such as bows, fishing poles, nets, and tying structures together."

"Nah, I'll have the lads at the construction site instead. Seriously, I'm in fucking Yorkshire and all of the guys who work in construction here are 6ft, ruggedly handsome, muscled, tattooed gods. I have the distinct pleasure of eye-fucking them every day on my way to uni. Shame they're probably all straight :/"

"For decades I worked and volunteered in HIV testing and prevention work.  I can't tell you how many times I have had positive people look me in the eye, and tell me they were going to infect as many people as possible.  There were people I knew to be positive who made it their life's work to seduce inexperienced new guys on the scene, and who never did protection.  Who said, ""if they don't protect or respect themselves, why should I?""

I was working in the field out of a major AIDS clinic when Viagra was approved for AIDS patient.  Within three months over 80% of our clients diagnosed with AIDS came back positive for gonorrhea.   You couldn't get gonorrhea back then if you were wearing a condom.  Which means 8 out of 10 were having unprotected sex, and just didn't give a damn that they were infecting others.

Each of us needs to know and face that this is the world we live in.  This is what is behind many of the smiling faces we meet.  Don't EVER take someone's word for it.  If you haven't been tested together, WRAP IT UP!  Better still, consider the joys of monogamy with a man whose character you can truly trust."
"I think dressing appropriately is more about circumstances than age. I‚Äôm 36 and I‚Äôm sitting here in my pokemon pajama pants and a spongebob t-shirt cause I‚Äôm home and who cares. In a casual situation it really doesn‚Äôt matter imo. Just don‚Äôt show up to a funeral in a Naruto t-shirt, you know?"
Is your boyfriend single
No; I just wish they were right.
This is the biggest thing that takes a guy from masc to fem looking. Just pluck the monobrow part leave the rest alone guys

"................it's just that ""no life time of year""."
"While this obviously isn't a carefully controlled scientific study (e.g. using test subjects completely matched in physical measurements and deemed equally subjectively attractive by a panel of observers, such that as many confounding factors as possible were minimised) it's still pretty representative. Myself, being mixed black and white but pale enough to look white in the right lighting, I did my own ""study"" where I compared how many replies I got when I said I was mixed to when I left the ethnicity section blank. When it was blank (i.e. most people probably assumed I was white), I got more replies

I don't think the majority of gay people are consciously racist, but there is a racial hierarchy in terms of attractiveness in the gay community. This suggests unconscious racial bias in enough gay people to create a disparity large enough for people of colour to notice (ask any gay PoC). Whether porn is to blame for this, or just the general stereotypes about race in society that lead to unconscious bias in everyone, who knows? I would guess that societal conditioning is the main factor, but the fetishization of different minorities in porn adds to the problem."
I miss good sex
"I have never been a gym-ripped #gayabs person. Some muscle queen who hit me up on one of the dating apps told me that I ""should feel honored that a fit muscular guy like [him] was willing to hook up with [me]"" after I turned him down."

"I once looked at Grindr in rural Norway. Closest 3 guys were at 60,90 and 100km (37,56 and 62 miles)

You know man I've been out of work for a while so I just typed it out of fustration really. I did not however expect to be offered a job as a human urinal. 
I heard OKCupid only shows you guys with similar attractiveness. 
"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 830am, why the fuck are you still awake playing Dota?‚Äù"
There‚Äôs nothing to learn. Just embrace your libido and be safe and consensual. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you want sex every day or never again. As long as you‚Äôre happy that‚Äôs all that matters.
"This time around? Yes, unfortunately.  Too much at stake."
I like short little nerdy boys who get enthusiastic about games and shows and science. 
Tell him exactly what you typed to us.
I fucking know; you wouldn‚Äôt do the same for POC and whites.
"Less restrictive gender roles. I‚Äôm already gay so I can act and take an interest in whatever I want to without people trying to question my sexuality. And I feel like I have better insight on my sexuality than I would otherwise because I am no longer tied down by societal expectations on how a straight man should act and feel about other men.

Unique insight about both men and women. My female friends will open up to me deeper on certain subjects than if I was straight. Sometimes straight guys will ask me for advice.

Sex. It‚Äôs easier to be sexually confident and to find sex than it is for straight guys, in some ways anyway. Guys will approach you more than girls will. Sex is also more fun when you can involve your butthole in it too. :)

Having gay events to go to. Gay pride, cruises, concerts, etc. Parties are always fun. Especially cruises, normal cruises don‚Äôt have anything on gay cruises."
The real question is why are we talking about bajingoes here though?

"If you make your son the butt of jokes about being a ""faggot"" and don't even introduce him to your friends, chances are you're tolerating him, but not accepting him. There's a huuuge difference there."
It would look very bad for them to go against such a resounding mandate from the people.

It is not progressive. Casual racism is normalised.  
The least awkward way to continue intimacy is to go with the flow of the moment and not have a stage preconception in your mind of what you 'should' do next.
"How did I know I was gay? Well, my first experience was with a guy and I didnt mind. 

Do I know for sure I am gay? No. I think I am bi. I do get aroused by (naughty images of) women too. Never had sex with a woman before but I don't think it's outright impossible. It's something I am willing to explore if ever I am no longer in a relationship (current BF is really gay and we aren't in an open relationship).

Sleep on it first. If you wake up and still feel the same way, then talk to your wife. The only way to fully destroy a marriage / relationship is by lying about things and keeping it in the dark. Talk it out but be prepared to get some verbal punches. Expect her to be mad/confused/sad, and will probably say some hurtful. BUT YOU DON'T RETALIATE. If you love her, be understanding and be open, and reassure her it's not her fault. "

"I was homeschooled, and one night it came up briefly in conversation that I was disappointed I missed out on some of the cool things everyone else gets to do in school, like prom. I wasn‚Äôt super disappointed; I was just curious about what it would have been like. A few weeks later he tells me to dress up in my best suit, I drive the two hours to get to his place, having not caught on, and he‚Äôs decorated his apartment with streamers, balloons, banners, and bought us both boutonni√®res. It was really sweet. "

"Dating is tough and being in a relationship is a lot of work unless you meet someone who is extremely low maintenance and if you are extremely low maintenance, too, but that's very unlikely.

Except for one person, I feel like I've been lucky to connect with pretty much everyone I've gone on a date with. And that's surprising to say because I'm an introvert and a little socially awkward, though I like the idea of being in controlled social settings. That connection not leading to anything is a different story."

I never had to say a word."

Oh yes on he Axe advice.  Too TOO much.
I find a lot of couples adorable. Particularly when there is a visible trait linking them.
"So you are gay and your complaining to your friend (and I assume others) about people asking you if you're gay.  

Look, it seems that he has your best interests at heart, I wouldn't take it as belittling - You're the one worried about your image, he is telling you why everyone thinks your a homo, sounds like he is sick of hearing you complain about it - TBH he probably already knows your gay.      "
"I Bottom because it's The Greatest Feeling on Earth! And I will Top with this average-sized dick because I like to Fuck, as well!

Fucked some hot guys who were subpar in bed. What looks good is not always good. 
First thing I do is stumble to the kitchen and make his lunch then give him a goodbye kiss out the door and go back to sleep for half an hour until he texts that he made it to work. Then it's time for coffee and putting my contacts in so I can be a person.

"He may not be into you at all. You do realise that. Just because he's gay doesn't mean he's into you.

All that has happened is that you know he's gay. You don't have to investigate that any further or talk to him about it. You know it already.

When you're ready, let him know you're gay. Do it in any way you want. 

Later, when the opportunity arises, go for coffee with him. Or a beer, since it's a frat.

Avoid any and all thoughts of fucking him. It's too soon. Take it slow. Don't be so excited."

Brain stuff.
I like when a bottom puts up a little fight and isn't too submissive. Too submissive = boring sex for me. When a guy is overly submissive you might as well be fucking a blow up doll. Part of the fun when I'm feeling dominant is the power struggle.

2. Look at your text conversations. I'm sure you have common interests you've talked about. It'll be easier than you think.
3. Hold his hand. Ugh so cute.
4. A spritz or 2 of cologne into the air and walk through it.
5. Be yourself, he already likes that person.
