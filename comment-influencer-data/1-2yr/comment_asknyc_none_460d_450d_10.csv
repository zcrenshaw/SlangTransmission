"One time I made it through an entire 45 minute ride without any panhandlers, buskers, drunks, showtimers, loud children, terrible BO, or delays. I managed to get a seat too. It really freaked me out."
"On a Bronx bound 1 train:

Tourist: How many more stops until Brooklyn?

Me: Um.. you're going in the wrong direction and this train line doesn't go to Brooklyn. Where are you trying to go? 

Tourist: Brooklyn? 

Me: Ok, Brooklyn is very large. Do you know *where* in Brooklyn you need to go?

Tourist: Back to our hotel, it's in Brooklyn.

Some other guy: Lemme see your phone. *grabs it roughly, looks at address* Bushwick! She's going to Bushwick!

Multiple people practically in unison: Get off this train at 72, get on a downtown 2 or 3 to 14th St and then get the L! First check and make sure it says it's going to Brooklyn! "
Jeremy's Ale House! They have breakfast too. Nothing like a 64oz coors light and bacon egg and cheese at a dive bar at 8am on a weekday.
Getting through security at LaGuardia 30 min before my flight
"Made the mistake of entering an empty car, immediately smelled the piss and saw the person responsible for piss smell. Quickly moved to the car next to it before the train started moving. 

Found a seat. Eating delicious momofuku ice cream and content with life when piss man enters the car. Everyone is visibly gagging at the smell and shrinking away. He walks right over to me and in garbled speech, asks for a bite of my ice cream. I panicked. I didn’t want to say no and risk the wrath of pee man. But also, it’s my damn ice cream. 

My response was to shove the entire scoop of ice cream into my mouth all at once. AN ENTIRE LARGE SCOOP. To this day I have no idea why this was my reaction of choice. 

Through the intense brain freeze, I managed to mumble “sorry all gone.” This appeased the urine King and he moved on to terrorize other passengers. 

This occurred my literal first week living in New York. What an introduction. "
Pee before you leave your location *every time.*

Punk rock and good venues. 
"“Where’s the Empire State Building?” - asked on the corner of 5th and 34th. 

“How do you get to Brooklyn?” -asked in Downtown Brooklyn

“I’m not looking for How-ston Street, I need to get to Hugh-ston Street!”

“Which side goes uptown?” -asked on the L platform

"
This sounds like an episode of seinfeld lol
"Going to my apt on the uptown A express, a guy in a orange tshirt and hat sits down next to me and asks if I want to see a card trick. I don't say anything, and he proceeds with the trick. Not bad, a slight of hand story based trick. As the train pulls into the 59th street stop he says ""I've got another magic trick for you? Want to see me make all the white people disappear?"" and yes, they all got off at that stop."
"I got on the 1 train and the entire car was full of people playing board games. Boggle, scrabble, monopoly, etc. It wasn't near peak hours so it didn't bother me, but I've never experienced anything similar since."
"I once watched a woman berate a police officer who wouldn’t tell her where the “Big Apple” was “you know, the one the city got it’s named from!” She was convinced there was a statue of an apple somewhere. "
Not really a tourist question but I once saw a lady trying to swipe a $5 bill at a turnstile. 
"My friends older brother. My brother being able to breathe and not have panic attacks that he insists aren’t panic attacks.

Edit: word."
Looking down at the city from the 107th floor of tower 1
This really makes me smile. Classic New Yorkers. It is really awesome how everyone will earnestly give directions.
"You’re supposed to say, “practice!”"
"I was walking down the West Side highway, somewhere around 40th Street, and a tourist walks up to me and points at New Jersey and asks, ""Is that the Manhattan skyline?"""
I would not allow that.
"Man if i was that police officer, I would tell her it's in Far Rockaway or Staten Island or some really hard and inconvenient place to get to.  "
"Was once asked, while standing in Times Square, ""Where is Times Square?"" I just looked, gestured vaguely and said, ""welcome."""
I had a friend I just met from France go into the Subway restaurant beside my apartment and try to buy a metro card.
"Repeat to yourself over and over ""this is the greatest city in the world, this is the greatest city in the world, this is the greatest city in the world"" until you believe it. "
"On Broadway in Queens...""Where are the Broadway shows?"""
"I’ve told this here a few times, but last summer I was working the midnight shift over the weekends. For almost a week straight going back to BK in the mornings, I saw a different homeless guy jerking off on the bench every day. But specifically every time they were in the last seat on the same bench, the last time I witnessed this I saw a woman in scrubs walk down the stairs, look at the homeless guy, then look at the bench, then back at the homeless guy, then she sits down right next to this tommy Chong looking guy who’s wailing on his dick like it killed his father and opens her magazine. In that moment I knew I wasn’t the most desensitized person in NYC."
"Humans are surprisingly adaptable. I’ve lived over a bar and by a busy street for years and sleep fine

On the other hand, when I visit the suburbs, I don’t sleep well the first night because it’s *too quiet*"
"2005 \- two women stopped me near the World Financial Center:

Her: Yeah where's the freedom tower

Me: Uh well, the World Trade Center was right here (gestures to foundation)

Her: (audibly annoyed) I know that, where is the FREEDOM TOWER??

Me: It will be right there eventually, when it's finished.

Her friend: Oh come on, let's go, she doesn't know anything

Her: What do you mean ""when it's finished"", I saw a picture of it online, right here!

(hands me print out with picture of architectural rendering of WTC1)

Her: WHERE. IS. **THIS.**"
Is this a... what day is this?

"""But Times Square has trolleys and Art Deco buildings and men in suits and hats! This is just a cheap piece of shit with billboards and overpriced chain resturaunts""

""Yeah"""
"They made you stay. You make them wait. If they had let you move out when you wanted, they would've had 2 weeks to paint. "
Freedom
Got off the (S) shuttle train in BROOKLYN and asked me which way to Times Square.
Podcasts and music. 
"That sounds like something from the Twilight Zone. 

It's 3 am, you have insomnia, you're on an empty platform and all of a sudden a V train pulls into the station and you get on it without really paying attention. You're the only one in your car, you pass out in the car, you don't know for how long. When you wake up, the train is going underground at good speed, the car is still empty. You wait 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, the train hasn't come to a station, or even slowed down. 10 minutes, 20 minutes, it just rumbles and rumbles. You begin to look at the ads. You don't recognize any of the products. You take out your phone, you can't get any reception, but that's when you notice, the clock isn't moving..."
Real neighbors and people not calling the cops over fucking everything.
"SIR HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT CLEAR?! IT ONLY TAKES 5 MINUTES AND YOU CAN SKIP THIS LONG LINE. NO, I WILL NOT MOVE OUT OF YOUR WAY AND LET YOU INTO THE PRECHECK LINE."
Liberty Inn is your answer. It's not like love hotels in Japan though.
Wasn't expecting as legitimate a reason for this question as was provided. Good cover.
Right? Like sure we're gonna grab your phone out of your hand and use it to yell the correct directions in your face
"The view of the towers from my bedroom window

Not having as many tourists and tragedy\-hunters clogging the streets

Cortlandt Street subway station 

Half of Park Row not being permanently shut as an NYPD driveway

And definitely kozmo.com"
They lock you in Småland and force you to assemble shelves.
"Rudy Giuliani. Back when he was just an asshole, and not a partisan, fascist kook. "
"Shorty's isn't bad. If I recall they ship up dough from Philly for the rolls.

Edit: rolls"

No “free day” in the city is ever worth the aggravation.
glad you both are here to speak about it 
"Not super clueless, but pretty hilarious every time.. I worked right next to the east river park in wburg where they have the seasonal smorgasburg food fair from May-Oct or something. Well it's in a lot of tourist mags and blogs and shit, so every year, dead of winter, some family comes strolling in like ""Hey do you know where xxx restaurant is"" and I get to break the news that they've ventured to the Brooklyn waterfront in 0 degree weather for nothing.

 Then they ask for a restaurant recommendation.. fuck if I know, I eat bodega sandwiches, truck burritos, and grocery store pizza."
I worked in the base of the Empire State Building for a couple weeks before I realized. 
A Good bagel
"No, you cannot. Manhattan is the best-served by the subway, Brooklyn next. Parts of Queens aren't well-covered, and Staten Island the least -- doesn't even have the subway. 

Here is a [map of our ""subway deserts""](http://gothamist.com/2016/07/12/subway_desert_map.php)."
"This happened a couple months ago. I've lived in the city for about 6 years.

I returned from vacation at about 2 AM. I hopped on the train in Manhattan (I think it was the 4 line) and as soon as the doors opened a fuck ton of half-eaten Starbucks Frappuccinos (associated garbage) hit my legs. Apparently, some teenage girls were attempting to litter by straight up throwing trash out of the car and all of the said trash hit me. My jeans were soaked in old frappuccino, etc.

The girls just laughed and sat down. I let it slide, since they were about 13, and grabbed a seat. I was sitting next to a normal looking guy, he was well dressed and looked tired but definitely not homeless. 5 seconds later he started projectile vomiting everywhere! Like, I had never seen so much vomit travel so far, it reminded me of the scene in the shining where blood covers an entire hallway. Or something from that Nintendo Switch game Splatoon.

I'm now, by association, soaked in this guys vomit and leftover Starbucks. This dude is clearly not doing well, so I did the right thing and calmly walked to the end of the car where the conductor is (soaked in vomit, mind you) and notified him that there was a sick passenger on the train.

There is where it gets good. When the conductor made the announcement that they were briefly stopping at the next stop to take care of a sick man, and everyone in the train gets mad at ME. They started cursing at me and saying things like ""what the hell man! I've got places to go."" In my head, I'm like, ""dude, it's 2 AM and this man just vomited his rib cage out of his body, what the fuck!?"" Like 2-3 passengers tried to pick physical fights with me for doing the ""right"" thing.

I ended up getting off at the next stop and just calling an Uber, I warned the Uber driving on the phone before getting picked up about my predicament (I am covered in vomit, I am so sorry, I can find some old grocery bags to sit on, etc) and he said it was totally fine. And then the next day my Uber rating dropped about 10 points.

That was a rough night."
"Not a question, but I was giving a walking tour of Chinatown, and one of the tourists (from Jersey iirc) said: ""I never come down to this part of New York! Usually I just stay in Manhattan."""
Yep.  My office on 51.
He drives too much and holding the break down gets exhausting or he thinks it saves gas. Lots of cabs and livery drivers do it. 
"“Yeah, it’s in Tottenville on Staten Island.”"
"If you’ve got iPhones and location services turned on, you might be able to pull where you were at what time last night. 

Privacy -&gt; Location Services -&gt; System Services (at the very bottom) -&gt; Significant Locations. It used to be set up differently, but might show you where you were. 

Also, if either of you have Waze (and maybe Apple Maps?), it’ll lots of times store where you parked the car, too. "
"A lady dressed in a full ball gown, at say 4 PM on a weekday. Not a costume, just a fancy ball gown, and those long gloves up to her elbows, making these “meeeep-meeeeep!!!!” noises, on I think F train going downtown. I think on W4th, a costume character guy walks in, dressed as Spider-Man, and she starts screaming.....like, ear-pearcinh screams...and he starts yelling at her. Now, the weird thing was...no one paid any attention to them, all the way to Delancey when he left :)"

"I was in Harlem on 125th street and a van full of Chinese tourists rolled down their window at a stoplight, the person driving (uptown) asked me which way ""to statue of liberty""...what made the situation even more awkward is that they clearly asked me because I was the only white person on 125th street at that moment and like went out of their way to get my attention...I pointed them downtown and wished them luck. "
