"Ahh, J, one of the worst!

* Sex on her period without letting me know she was on it

* It was becoming apparent she was a serious man hater 

* She was a single mother who was a vegetarian.  Would not allow her son whatsoever to eat meat and would force her dietary choices onto him. 

* Would not let her son participate in any boyish activity.  The little  man begged me to not tell her when I taught him how to throw because he was afraid of what she would do. 

* I REALLY wanted to stick around to help her kid, but my last straw was when she slapped me out of the blue IN... FRONT... OF... MY...FAMILY during a family get together during the holidays.  When I asked her why she did it, she said that she did it because I was playing rough with one of my family member's young boys and I shouldn't have been encouraging such behavior.    Never before have I came so close to striking a woman and just beating the crap out of her, but I knew I had to get rid of her THAT NIGHT before I got driven over the edge and ended up with domestic violence and assault on my record. 

I dropped off all contact with her after that, but heard through the grapevine that her next boyfriend ended up beating the living daylights out of her and she also lost custody of her son for emotional abuse some years later. "

"I said to myself I would never mention this but it's a fitting time so hear goes, I am shaking while typing this...

I worked as security on a old industrial unit that was being rebuilt and changed to business units. The job entailed sitting in one of those metal shipping cabins and had just a desk, 3 chairs and the security monitors. Nothing every happened other than the occasional group of bored teens at night looking for somewhere to drink or smoke, that was until 'that night'.

It was just like every other night and I spent the first few hours playing on my phone and did a couple of laps of grounds then decided to make a cup of tea. As I was making it I could sense movement on the monitor and glanced up at the monitor. At first I thought I was looking at a pile of rubbish bags that had just been fly tipped, that's until 'it' moved. I was totally frozen to the spot and every hair on my body stood on end, what ever it was had wing/arm type things and was incredibly skinny with no hair, I would estimate it to be around 7ft tall. It's legs seemed like they were very boney and it appeared to scuttle along, it had very large black eyes and small ears on the top of its head. I tried to think what creature this was as it had to be something but this was like nothing else. The monitors are black and white so it's hard to say what colour it was but what ever it was the creature appeared to be chattering it's teeth really really fast, at this point I let out a scream type noise and the creature straight up looked at the camera which was about 100ft from it and was on the lamp post next to the hut and I straight up would of shat myself if I had eaten that day. The creature then stretched its arm/wings out then flew off. I called the police and my supervisor, the police arrived 10 minutes later although it seemed like a hour, they did not believe me and laughed it off but I asked for a lift home as no way was I staying there, they said no so I called a taxi then rung my supervisor and told him I was leaving, he said if I leave then not to come back which I had no intention of doing anyway. I called Jason about a week later and he said he had gone over the recordings and he handed in his notice that day. What ever that thing was it was like nothing I had ever seen and I have kept well clear of that site, I think it's offices and factories now, I have not heard of any more sightings but then again I have never asked. I only told one other person before and I am not sure if they believed me but I know what I saw and I hope to never see it again."
"The top guy in my high school class became a cardiologist and makes $500,000 per year.

More interestingly, the top student in the class after me became an attorney and does a lot of human rights cases.

They were both good people in high school so I have no reason to shit on them."

"They get a bunch of hospitals together to increase the buying power.  Or doctor's offices/nursing homes/pharmacies (on the non-acute side).  I'm biased because I work for one, so take everything here with appropriate skepticism.  I also work on the non-acute side, so I see this in terms of helping smaller business out, although sometimes the clients are chains of 40+ nursing homes.

Anyway, you take a couple of thousand doctor's offices, nursing homes and pharmacies and you look at what they are buying- gloves, adult diapers, paper for exam tables, etc.  You go to the companies that make these and say ""we can direct the purchasing from these companies to you if you drop your price.  Also, you'll need to pay us 1-3% of the money you make from our members buying from you.""  Which would violate kickback laws, except for the exemption.  

You then go back to the members and tell them ""we can get you a really great deal on paper for exam tables, syringes, stethoscopes, etc. if you buy from these companies.""  They buy from those companies, get lower prices on the stuff they're buying.  The company gets more business, the GPO gets a cut of the sales.  

This also works with pharmaceutical suppliers, especially for things like generics.  ""Switch to this generic for prilosec and save 15%""  The maker of that generic then gives 3% of the sales of the generic prilosec to the GPO for setting everything up.

It is a kickback and is only possible because of just how fucked up the US healthcare system is.  I'd love for us to not be necessary.  (I do data analysis, I could switch industries.)  But given just how fucking much some of the pharmaceuticals are (the cure for Hepatitis C costs $84,000-$100,000) lowering the price is not a bad thing.  If the US government actually worked to help control prices, GPOs would not be necessary.  They're a market resolution to a fucked up situation.

tl;dr They're a kickback funded Costco for hospitals and doctor's offices.  They should not be necessary, but given just how fucked up US healthcare is, they do exist.  Pharma companies and medical supply makers fucking hate them for cutting into prices and profits.

"Oh I've got this one.

My fiancé planned a girls trip with her bridesmaids out of town to visit another one of her bridesmaids, V, so they could do all sorts of wedding stuff.  There was another bridesmaid who lives on the other side of the country, who had been in wanting to meet them in this city, that's 8 hours away from us anyways, because she has family there and it's a ""better city"" than the one we live in now.

So this trip is in about a month or so, and my fiancé has it all planned out. She's got the hotel booked, she's going to drive the rest of her bridesmaids down herself, pay for the gas herself, to go to this city that Z had been begging for her to drive to so she didn't have to come to the one we live in. Mind you, my fiancé had flown down last year for Z's birthday, and her plane ticket cost about triple what Z was going to pay. 

My fiancé gets a text last night from Z saying, ""Well, I've been thinking that me and my boyfriend are just going to get married next month. I'm tired of waiting, and I just want to do it."" She basically talked her boyfriend into skipping the whole engagement part and going right to the wedding. All because she's tired of waiting and she thinks it's ""her turn."" For the record, she has a reputation for getting jealous every time someone else gets engaged because she's been with her boyfriend for so long and he hasn't popped the question yet. And no, we're not talking about just a courthouse wedding. We're talking full on _wedding_.

So essentially, she's forcing her boyfriend into a wedding because she thinks she deserves it. But this isn't even the best part.

She asked my fiancé if she could just move her trip to some other time so she could be at her wedding. Not even as a bridesmaid. Of course, my fiancé said absolutely not, these girls are counting on me to get them down there to be a part of my wedding planning, just like Z had promised she would do. 

The craziest part of this is that Z has just zero idea how absolutely absurdly selfish she's being. She's had the most incredible princess complex I have ever seen in a woman and just cannot possibly fathom that she's causing any inconvenience to anyone because she believes the world revolves around her. 

tl;dr : Jealous bridesmaid cancels on trip that was her idea, for a wedding that she wants, to a man who hasn't proposed yet, and expects my fiancé to cancel the trip and be at her wedding instead.

Edited for clarity."

"Right, but that's what the whole thing came down to - offensive strategy for the Careers, vs defensive strategy for basically everyone else, because they know they can't fight the Careers. 

Offensive strategy is no good if everyone is on equal footing. But if you come in knowing that you're a trained killer against a bunch of underfed kids, offense isn't a bad idea. And the kids had a decent strategy about it, too. They didn't just kill indiscriminately. It was to secure supplies and a defensible position. Then they held off and let everyone else die of more natural causes before, I assume the plan was, turning on each other in a final bloodbath. Not a bad strategy, but more importantly, makes for good TV. "

"The (korean) communists in both north and south korea actually had established workers councils and civil institutions prior to the korean war. They had been fighting the japanese occupation for years and were highly organized. The difference is that in the north, these home-grown communists were supported by the soviet union and other regional communist powers, but in the south, these workers councils and other organizations were forcibly disbanded by the US and former japanese occupation collaborators (many of the individuals involved with the early south korean government had collaborated with the japanese occupation, or in some cases were industrialists or businessmen who had profited in some way from the occupation). 

This is actually a common theme in cold war proxy conflicts. A native communist movement gains power through mostly home-grown means, then the communist powers try to reinforce the new communist government while the capitalist powers try to fight them and install their own pro-capitalist government. See the soviet-afghan war, where the afghan communist party seized power and immediately requested military aid from the soviet union in order to fight the muslim extremists who resided in the mountainous, isolated regions of the country.

"Exactly. So you have this plane of ""Reality"" that we know of as the Universe. In our scientific pursuits, we've catalogued and theorized that there was (at least for our instance of existence) a ""Start"" and we call it the Big Bang.

Let me pose this idea though: The Universe doesn't expand because some particle deciding to quantum tunnel its ass a micrometer to the left, thereby setting off a massive chain reaction leading to the expansion and ""creation"" of the universe as we know it. Instead, a sentient being, made entirely of energy, DECIDES it wants to influence the creation of the universe.

This does not happen over the course of seven solar days of course. Thats ridiculous and the Bible is full of metaphor. Instead, God takes 40 bajillion years to experiment, create, and just be an all around cool guy. And then we happen.

"Nope, not in a good way at all.

I'm in Michigan, and worked in a fisheries laboratory about a decade ago. One of our major projects was nailing down the link between zebra mussels and a whole bunch of shorebirds that kept dying all over the state.

The zebra mussels did do a good of cleaning up the Great Lakes, but they over-cleaned it. A super clean lake is a dead lake. You need to hit a good balance... too much biological material and the lake basically suffocates because the oxygen demand is too high. Too little and you knocked the bottom out of the food chain so everything else what they eat, so it gets unstable, or the life just starves out.

Anyway. IIRC zebra mussels ate too much of the microscopic organisms and crashed their population. This let clostridium botulinum go gangbusters, because nothing else was eating them anymore, and they had all this nice sunlight in the now-clearer water to help them grow and reproduce. And also zebra mussels filter feed and eat all kinds of things, including the little c. botulinum bacteria. Since there was so much of that around and now so little of anything else, the zebra mussels ate a ton of it.

 If c. botulinum sounds bad, it's because it is... that's what causes botulism. Trace amounts aren't necessarily deadly but bioaccumulation is a bitch. The smaller fish would eat a little of the zebra mussels and be ok. The bigger fish would eat those fish and maybe have a problem. The shorebirds that ate those bigger fish would end up with a lethal amount and die of botulism. And if something else ate a bunch of those birds, they'd probably get a lethal dose too.

I don't recall that we published while I was still at that lab, but that was the theory that the university and the DNR had.

tl;dr Zebra mussels are probably why a bunch of dead seagulls (and other, more endangered species) ended up on the shores of the Great Lakes.

"Yes, the myth of Versailles as being this horribly excessive punishment was of course invented by Hitler, but for some reason popular history just seems to have taken him at his word. At some point popular history decided to throw Germany a bone of forgiveness, to accept some of the blame for Hitler's rise to power.

Yet Versailles was substantially more lenient than the conditions Germany imposed on France at the end of the Franco-Prussian war 50 years earlier. Or for that matter, the peace the allies imposed on Germany at the end of WW2. 

Of course the Germans protested the terms of Versailles as any negotiator should, but Germany had to cede very little territory most of which they had taken from France in the Franco-Prussian war or in poor areas where Germans were a minority anyway. The monetary compensation was less than the Germans demanded after the Franco-Prussian war, most of which was written off anyway, and didn't even begin to compensate France for trashing their country so badly. The allies demanded Germany become a democracy (the horror!) and limit their armed forces to prevent future wars (which again was never enforced).

Far more damage was done to Germany by Spanish flu and the great depression, which hurt every country.

I'm reminded of the story of the war between the Samnites and the Romans, in the early days of Rome's rise to power. The Samnites outmanoeuvred the Roman army, and [trapped them in a mountain pass with no water and both ends blocked off by Samnite forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Caudine_Forks). The Roman position was desperate and hopeless. The Samnite commander was the king's son, and he sent a message to his father asking what he should do with the trapped Romans. The reply came back from the king: ""let them go."". Bewildered, the king's son sent another message asking for clarification. The reply came back: ""Kill them all."". Shocked, the king's son asked again and the reply came back: ""Either let them go, and they remember our generosity and we become friends. Or kill them all and set back their power for generations. But don't humiliate them, or you'll have left them strong and eager for revenge"". The king's son couldn't bear to do either though, so let them go on condition they pass under a yoke, a practice by Italian custom in which they walk under a bar used to attach cattle to ploughs, implying that they are like animals. The Romans were free to go, but almost immediately repudiated the peace and the Samnites were conquered."

Someone else here said they feel like she seems very wooden in her sexuality, like there are pictures and video of her being ""sexy"" but it's not effortless like it is for a lot of other celebs, being ace would explain that cause I know as an ace person I'm super awkward if anyone wants me to try and be sexy lol.

"I believe 1% of the population are asexual. And I remember when she was dating Calvin Harris she was offered a fuck ton of money to appear in an underwear ad with him. She said no as it would be showing too much skin and didn't mesh with her image. And that is totally plausible, but at the same time I wonder if she's ace if that had something to do with it? I'm asexual so it kinda all makes sense to me and gives me that vibe"
"Essentially there are a few different races, Mikasa is one, everyone else in the walls are another. Everyone in the walls has the ability to turn into a titan. But there are seven titans that are like Eren, Annie, the colossal titan, the armored titan, etc, that can be controlled. You have to eat someone with the ability to turn into a titan to get it. Wren ate his dad, who came from outside the walls. 
The walls are on an island and on the mainland, the two races live like Jews and Germans WW2 style. Titan race are the Jews. Punishment is throwing them into the walls to become a mindless titan. 
Subjugating race stole children to brainwash and work for them and have titans they can control to fight in a war. Eren has a half-brother, the beast titan, who was one of them. 
War is crazy with technology now because titans are becoming obsolete with tanks and all that shit. 
The 'Germans' are sending the controlled titans in to kill everyone and steal the other controllable titans. There are seven, I believe. This probably is a terrible explanation. Look it up on wiki. It's insane and nothing is what you think. "

"As a kid was hiking through a marsh area like we did a lot.

We saw a fox/coyote/maybejustplaneolddog's head peeking out of the bushes at us. It was flat on the ground, so we figured it was hiding getting ready to pounce / make some kinda kill.

I remember the long nose and seeing the eyes. And it was twitching a bit which was freaky. It was looking up ahead (not directly at us), so we all were on our bikes and stupid fearless kids, so we just sat back and waited for it to make whatever kill it was gonna make.

Except it didn't do shit. Eventually one of the guys gets brave / stupid and throws something in it's direction like a rock.

Thing doesn't move, at least, not toward us. It's still twitching like a mother fucker.

My stupid friend gets restless, decides to approach it.

Again no reaction.

Finally he got a stick and he poked the thing and it didn't move. So then he pushes it with the stick.

It was just the head, or 3/4s of it. Him pushing it sent it sliding into the clearing.

There must have been millions of maggots(? some kinda disgusting looking insects) eating it.

Man I wanted to throw up like I never have before."
"When my brother and I were very young, approximately 6 and 8 respectively, my parents rented the movie Alien and showed it to us in an all-dark house. Neither my brother or I were the type of kids to get scared by ""scary"" movies or have nightmares of any kind so, I think it's why they thought it was safe.

They turned out to be right because, even though we were tense during the movie, afterwards we would have our dad pretend to be the Xenomorph and chase us up the stairs for bed time every night thereafter. We would shriek and laugh, run to our room, and hide under the covers. That went on for a few years."

"By far one of the best villains and most convincing and disturbing villain performances I've seen. Before I saw GoT I saw this gif several times and thought it was a comical hobbit-style scene. Oh god how wrong I was, it was so disturbing. I *hated* him viscerally, so his acting was top-notch to pull that off with no detectable hint of him being an actually decent human being in real life.

Charles Dance was similar as Tywin Lannister. Not disturbing but convincing in his coldness. He reportedly complained that it was so difficult to portray that character because he couldn't stand the way he spoke to Peter Dinklage. But he kept it hidden on screen and played the character hard, and it worked beautifully."

"Agreed. The key is just to let them help you in ways that won't strain them. My grandma has been struggling with this a lot lately, so I make it a point to call her for 'help' sometimes, even if I don't really need it. 

Like ""Hey grandma, I'm buying new sheets, can you come along and help me pick out nice ones?"" Or ""Hey grandma, could you come over and help me do some decorating around the house?"" 

Grandparents helping you is less about you and more about them. Let them feel important. It means more to them than you think. "

"As a resident vagina haver and tampon user I call such bs on that story. No WAY she wouldn't have noticed the smell herself if it was that bad. Guy claimed he could smell it before the scene started. She also would have developed an infection as that smell had to have been caused by significant bacteria build up. Anyone with a vagina can tell you, the second an infection starts up, you know. It immediately starts feeling wrong. So the idea that someone could leave a tampon in for weeks, not smell it if it supposedly smelled that bad, and not get infected (or worse, got infected and decided to do a porn shoot anyway) is just not even possible."

"What a great film. Although disturbing, is Louis really a villain? Or anti-hero that represents a sinister world view? I group him more in the Richard III camp – a character destroying everything in his path until he reaches the top. Unlike Richard III, Louis actually succeeds (at least for now).

"Any company soliciting product sales on the basis of technological breakthrough should be required to;

1. Prove their claimed breakthrough.

2. Prove their breakthrough is their own and unique

3. Be required to explain to any buyer the technological breakthrough.

I say this because things like Euclidean's Unlimited Definition engine are the epitome of fooling people with hard to understand technology as well as non-transparency. These things are basically legal forms of lying.

If a car company can say, ""Our car's transmission makes your car 4x more efficient than if you didn't have it."" without explaining they're comparing it to the literal worse possible transmission, and that their transmission design is literally older than their brand; they can effectively lie to someone."

"My friend was getting kicked out of school for getting caught drinking too many times. His parents were preparing to come pick him up. 

I had a meeting with the Dean for other reasons and at the end explained my friend was the hardest working person I knew. He had learning disabilities and would literally study from the second he got out of class until 1am just to pull Cs and a few Bs and then go out and party hard for a couple hours.

I was able to convince the dean that he was the most worthy person I knew to be there in the mix of all of us partying like crazy.

I got a call a few months later that my friend was missing. They found that he blacked out in a creek and drowned in 3 inches of water on his way back to the dorm.

I can't take much responsibility for that, but it fucks me up. In a moment of assertiveness and courage I fought for my friend and put him on a path that caused him to die a different day.

I shook the deans hand at his funeral and we both just kind of stared at each other for a second. Like no matter the intentions, we did this."

"In what way?
The German plan for invasion involved river barges pulled by tugboats. They'd need a full day to cross the channel, they'd need the channel to be smooth as glass, which is rare. 
They'd need to take a deepwater port or have Mulberry Harbour equivalents for supply purposes, and they'd need to maintain control of the channel for several weeks at least against an RAF that was still producing aircraft and pilots, and a Royal Navy which had more battleships than the Kriegsmarine had surface ships.
Battleships are vulnerable to air attack, yes, but the Home Fleet had a lot, along with cruisers, corvettes, destroyers and MTBs. The German surface fleet was tiny in comparison, and while the RN would take losses to air and Uboat attack, in the face of enemy troops landing on UK shores, they'd press on. England expects, and all that."

"The biggest thing I came to realize while I was in school, which I have then passed on to people I work with, is that mental illness is not like physical illness. If a person has an illness like Scurvy, Polio, high blood pressure, etc. The disease is basically a foreign invader that needs to be removed through medication, diet, surgery, etc. Once the cause is removed, the person usually gets better.

Most mental illness doesn't work that way. While in the last 40 years we have gotten much better at defining mental illnesses, it's not like a virus where we can run a blood panel and say, ""yep, according to our tests you have (insert Disease)!"" Our definitions of various mental illnesses are better defined as names given to different sets of symptoms. There's no test that can be run that would say, you have bi-polar, it's more like a series of tests and interviews that determine what abnormal behaviors you are displaying, how they impact your life, and what name we have given to the condition that other people with similar issues have suffered.

So if you are diagnosed with the Flu, there is a specific invader that is causing you to be sick. If you are diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, it means that the sets of symptoms you have most closely match those of other people who have had the same problem, and the collective name for that batch of symptoms is called BPD.

The reason this is important is that people think that mental illness is like regular illness. Take a pill, follow doctor's orders, and get better. But Mental illness comes from you, it's a collection of issues from brain chemistry, mental trauma, adaptation to the environment you were raised in, personality, etc. there is nothing to ""cure"" since it's mostly just you and how you view and react to the world. Symptoms can be managed, but usually not cured.

For most mental illness there will never be a ""cure-all"" since there is nothing to cure. Yes, some conditions like some forms of schizophrenia come from an imbalance of brain chemistry and can be treated, and in others intensive therapy can help someone to recognize bad behavior and change their thought processes, but it's not like a disease, it can't just be removed. 

I try to focus on people not having false hope about ""getting over it"" and instead focus on ways for a person to learn to recognize when they are having an episode that might cause them to start acting in ways that would have a negative impact their daily lives, and to work on ways to manage those behaviors.

Weed is legal in my state; my friend in a neighboring state says she'd never want to live here because weed destroys lives, it's a gateway drug, it makes people lazy, etc etc.  All of the bullshit that has been thrown around for decades, and has in many cases shown to be neutral at best.

Tangential: living in a legalized state, a lot of things are getting worse because people are moving here in such numbers.  Rent is rising way faster than wages, housing is getting harder to find, and traffic is getting worse.

"This is so important for people to realize; I am a volunteer with the Red Cross and one of the big pushes right now is regarding home fire and smoke detector safety... Basically everyone still has in their heads this 1970's and earlier timeline of how home fires progress- or even an inflated sense of security due to ""flame retardant"" materials... we all think ""get the kids, find the pets, get the valuables, get out"". But the reality is when those standards were ingrained in our memories, you had something like 15 minutes to get out of your home in case of fire in most cases. Now in many fires it's something like 3 minutes or less. And in my area, instances of home fires have DOUBLE in the last 18 months- going from 1 every 4 days, to 1 every 2 days."

"Wouldn't say this is ""concerning"", but it does show just how many people don't read the fucking T&amp;C's.

I worked at a service provider, and once you signed up for any service or product with us it would automatically renew upon expiry.  If you didn't want it to automatically renew, you had to opt-out.  It said this in very clear terms on the sign-up/purchase page, as well as in the T&amp;C's.  In addition, we sent an email about two weeks prior to the automatic renewal to advise that your service/product would be automatically renewed - if you didn't want it, you have two weeks to tell us otherwise.

This didn't stop people getting the almighty shits up and demanding refunds because they ""never agreed to an auto-renewal"".  We'd point to our sign-up page and T&amp;C's, but it didn't matter in their mind:  they didn't want it, therefore anything in those T&amp;C's were invalid and they were going to get their money back.  So they'd go running to their bank and request a chargeback, in which case the bank would side with the customer until we proved we were correct in performing the charge and entitled to the cash.

After a while we'd decided we'd simply had enough of it, and introduced a $75 administration fee for chargebacks.  You initiate a chargeback?  We suspend your entire account, and it's not getting reinstated until you pay us the entire amount charged back plus $75.  Written into our T&amp;C's, and every single customer emailed to advise new T&amp;C's.  

Didn't stop the ridiculous number of chargebacks, but did bring in some extra cash.  "

"French for the past 31 years, he's far from the only one to recognize that.

However I also understand why so many people react the other way. The main ""problem"" with romanis (coming from people who don't like them) is the fact that they move everywhere. Which means that if there is a problem, they just pack up and leave. A couple years ago the village where my mother lives was hit by wave of burglaries which started right when a romani camp settled in, and stopped right when they moved out. 

So even if it's only a couple of them who were responsible, I can understand the frustration from knowing there is nothing you can do about it. Cops won't go looking for them because they have no idea where they went, and inside romani camps they are pretty tight so even the ones who aren't doing anything wrong won't say anything about the others if cops come looking.

Think about all the outrage aimed at cops in the US. It's because they can act with little to no repercussions most of the time and they protect each other. Frustration grows for the victims. It's kind of the same situation, albeit to a lighter degree because they are rarely involved in murders. "

She makes excuses like killing people is bad. Or that kilgrave could change. Near the end you even find out she could have left much sooner in the dinner but stayed too. A part of her clearly had the hots for him something kilgrave liked to rub in her face, and it was only in the end when he killed someone a bit too close to jessica she decided to finally kill him, kind of like a girl in an abusive relationship finally deciding to dump the bf and go to the cops.

"True, but two alternate perspectives as someone who has been on the knife's edge poverty (I remember being down to my last $81 five years ago with a partner who could never reliably hold a job to save her life... in a town with 13% unemployment in 2010):

1)  Sometimes you need the ""frivolous"" purchases to keep sane.  Just because you're poor doesn't mean you're not entitled to giving yourself little ""treats"" from time to time.  I remember living on sardines, beans and rice for the better part of a year... and I wanted to fucking snap after one month.  Buying a $7 rotisserie chicken once a month was my treat to make me feel like I was still worth something.  Think of it this way: the woman's clothes/lipstick aren't as destructive as alcohol or drugs.

2)  Maybe she needs it for job interviews?  It's possible she needed better options for job searching.

Some people would say having the dog is ""frivolous bullshit"", but as someone who has a cat, sometimes it's your pet that keeps you from going over the deep end.  I don't know where I'd be without my cat."

However, the Galactic Republic screwed the Galaxy over in a thousand different ways, threw billions of lives away over needless wars, never actually got anything done(Just look at how they left Naboo to burn just because they couldn't agree on what to do), and was extremely corrupted to the core. Hell, the Jedi were just a single member in the Republic and they had more political power than entire nations. The Clone Wars really shows just how bad it was... They started an entire Galactic War over a religious dispute, despite the fact that the Republic wasn't supposed to hold any religion over the rest.

So... What are the Rebels actually fighting for? Representation? They have that in the Empire.

Voting rights? Planets that have democracy still have democracy on them under the Empire. Most planets are autocratic, anyways. What's the point?

Seriously, what are the Rebels fighting for?"

"What should I do when everyone else on the road has decided to go 65-75, despite multiple signs saying ""work area- speed reduced to 55"".

I don't want to watch every car pass me, I don't want to cause an accident.... but I also have pretty bad luck. It's very likely that if there are 20 cars doing the same thing, I'm the one that gets pulled over. 

That's actually why I'm so paranoid about this... I live in a city where people barely stop at stop signs and constantly run red lights. (I think I just described every city lol). I see it happen constantly!

The one time I veryyy slowly rolled through a stop sign with a brief pause (in the middle of the night and no cars around), I got pulled over for it.

The one time I tried to run a yellow light and it turned red in the middle of the intersection, while the law says that's actually okay, I got a ticket anyway.

So for years, if I got one more ticket, I'd have had enough points to accrue consequences like needing to go to court and likely driving school.

I became the asshole that everyone honked at, because I actually came to a full stop and looked around before proceeding through a stop sign, I stopped at all yellow lights, and I refused to speed more than 5 MPH to join the flow of traffic.

I ended up keeping these habits as I grew older, even once my points disappeared, because to me, that feels like driving safely now. 

People still honk at me for stopping at stop signs and yellow lights. And get annoyed when I'm driving 5 MPH over the speed limit in the right lane. (Because they want to stay at 70-75, not drop to 55 for the work zone).

Sometimes I am tempted to just drive like everyone else... it actually confuses people to have someone come to a full stop at a stop sign or refuse to proceed until the light is green. But they aren't the ones who will be dealing with rude law enforcement and paying a hefty ticket they can't afford!  So I continue to drive like a little old lady. "

"Redwings have been going downhill in quality.

I have a pair from ~10 years ago that I use for my motorcycle. I buy the same model every year for work boots. Style 2234.

My decade old boots have better quality materials and better build quality than a brand new pair. Better padded tongue, better liner material, better and cleaner stitching, etc. The difference is immediately noticeable. My current work pair has the left tongue sewn in crooked and the footbed had the cloth top layer peel off of the foam within a week.

And about 5 years ago Redwing switched laces to a style that refuse to stay tight. I replace the laces day one, now. I still buy that same model for work every year because finding boots that fit well is difficult for me. But year after year walking into that Redwing store I've seen the quality degrade over time.

Redwings aren't what they used to be. They're still leagues better than WalMart boots but I'm worried that they're going to Sears themselves."

P.S.: I'm not saying women should be aloud to hit men, just that it is particularly vile when a man hits a women, because there is nothing we can do about it."

"Hey, I know a lot of people like to be dicks when discussing opposing ideas but I'm truly just trying to explain that it's vile in both cases. Saying it's particularly vile in cases of male on female is imo part of the reason why women get away with abuse. If you read through this comment and are offended, I did not properly convey my feelings, so let me preemptively apologize.

The reason it's vile in male on female abuse is because she can't get away *during* the act. What comes after though is largely dependent on her emotions (money, location, and length of relationship also play into it, but that's unisex). In most cases police will side with her, shelters will side with her and courts will typically side with her, and grant her custody over any children. Most male abusers will continue to harass their victims for months/years afterwards but in the majority of cases society will try to help her. It's an extremely hard road to go down, but along the way society is expect to pick her up and help her.


The reason female on male abuse is so vile is because of how alone the victim is, during the act and afterwards, along with the pain. By your own admission most males could literally hurt their abusers with ease, so how come there are any male victims of abuse in the world? During the abuse part of what they are thinking is how they somehow deserve it and are not to retaliate, else the police will come. Yes he will have bruises, but 99/100 cases, if a woman calls the cops saying her SO hit her, he's being dragged away and his kids are now left with an abuser. If he takes it, afterwards, depending on the state/County rules if he calls the cops he may *still* be the one taken away by the police even if he didn't strike back. He ~~could go to a shelter~~ can't really go to a shelter since only 1-2 male abuse shelters exist in America. He could go to the courts, but again they treat the woman better and very likely the custody of their children will go to the woman. They're also much less likely to reach out to friends or family since it's seen as something only women go through. Basically there's also nothing a man can do either, and any man who does retaliate is the star of the 9 o'clock story about violence against women.

A woman who is physically abusing a man is basically using his good nature against him. I'm not sure which is more vile, mental abuse or physical abuse. I do know that neither is ""particularly vile"".

I might have come up with an analogy. An abused male is like a sad withering tiger in a cage. Some kids will come up to it, poke it with a stick, shout at it, etc, but it can't do anything since it will be beaten by the handlers if it roars and scares the children. (edit This is kind of a shit analogy lo)

Tl:Dr: All abuse is vile, there's nothing particularly vile about either gender though. You might be sexist (in the literal way not the SJW insult sort of way) if you think any abuse is more vile just because of gender. Be jolly y'all, don't hit anyone, and shame your female friends if they hit a man just as much as male on female

"The last time I move it was like clock work.  I got the U-Haul and was at the house by 9.  I told everyone to show up for 930.  In the mean time my wife and I started loading boxes into the hutch above the cabin.  By the time the guys arrived everything was ready to move, and arranged how we wanted it out on the truck.  8 guys show up, we chain the stuff on to the truck with my wife directing traffic on the inside and me in the truck packing, making sure if anything breaks it's on me and no one else.  We get to the new place around 11:30 and the pizza arrives a few minutes later.  The guy start eating pizza and beer, the power company showed up and turned on the power.  20 minutes after that the cable guy shows up to hook up the internet/phone/cable.  We finish eating and start unloading.  Again, I'm in the truck unpacking and the wife is in the house directing traffic making sure everything goes where it needs to.  The last thing on and the first thing off the truck was toilet paper and paper towel.  By 1 o'clock everything was done and the guys were on there way.

Activating Event: This is the real-world event triggered your anxious thoughts (e.g. someone cut you off in traffic, your boss yelled at you, etc.).
Beliefs About Event: What are your impulsive thoughts concerning the activating event. try to identify the absolutes, so things that start with ""I must"", ""I can't"", ""I don't"", etc.
Consequences of your beliefs: How are these beliefs influencing your actions and emotions. What are you doing as a result of these actions and what further activating events are being triggered as a result. How are you feeling right now? This is an important metric for review later on.
Dispute your beliefs: This one is important. Take each belief you wrote down earlier and cross examine your self. Use logic over emotion. Contest absolutes, and try to pretend you are cross examining someone else stating your beliefs. The farther you can remove yourself from the situation, the better.
Effect: Write down how you feel after the exercise. This is a good metric to evaluate how successful the treatment is. You can then go back and look at your most successful cases and try an emulate/improve on that success.

"Cough syrup is a reference to a specific prescription kind that has promethazine and codeine in it. The first one is an antihistamine (like benadryl) that at extremely high doses causes delirium and at small doses causes allergy relief and drowsiness. The more you take the drowsier you get, but it's not right to say the more you take the more delirious you get since you don't start out delirious with small doses. On the journey to delirious, you find relaxation and potentially a little euphoria too.  And drowsiness slowly drifts into complete delerium the more you take. First, you'd start out seeing things like did that lamp over there just shift a bit instantly (not scary, ""hah, i'm really high!"" kind of thought about it) and it will turn into full on hallucinations like talking to people, demons, big spiders, etc. and you actually thinking it's all real. The second drug codeine is a plain old painkiller, meaning feelings of euphoria, sleepiness, and general attitude of well-being (AKA I don't have a care in the world and I'm not asking for ice cream not because I don't want it or it's bad but because I already just had some).

That high is complex, because you can change the amount of either one independently. Some people even pop a painkiller with more opiates in them to intensify that aspect of the high -- well-being, euphoria, and drowsiness. But when you make the drink, the proportion of one to the other is determined by the cough syrup. But sipping on a good amount of that cough syrup will make you feel lightly euphoric in a slow motion/choppy/almost trippy world with the well-being of the opiate causing the hallucinations to be welcomed and not distracting or terrifying. You will also get 'stupid' the same way drunk does kinda, and more giggly.

People drink it with sprite, because cough syrup tastes like shit and you have to drink a good amount of it to get high. When put together, the drink tastes good overall (especially if you add the traditional jolly rancher to it as well). So you walk around sipping this candy drink that is getting you fucked up. The reason it's a party thing makes perfect sense, it's just like walking around with a beer in your hand. Except this drink tastes good enough to where you can't even detect a bad element in it.

edit: And they give it a lot of nicknames in the party scene, because ""cough syrup"" sounds like factory toxins. Drug dealers are sellers just like legit sellers and they do legit marketing (not to mention the cool people doing it are cool themselves and will sometimes create cool nicknames). The original popular syrup turned your sprite purple, and for whatever reason (ton are thought to be the reason), is often drank in a double styrofoam cup with lots of ice. It also can knock you on your tail. It came from Texas -- particularly Houston. With that background, you can guess which part of it they're implying to reference it: lean, purple drank, purple, drank, dirty sprite, dirty, mud, syrup, sizzirp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOWKGXpl9E0), Texas, Houston.

It's also often used with an upper to keep you awake. Sometimes simple redbulls all the way to adderall, meth, cocaine, or ritalin. E.g. in King of the Fall, Weeknd is saying he's mixing some lean with Adderalls in the verse ""Put it [adderall] in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas"". The previous verse said he he just had a plate for breakfast, which is slang for the 30 or 60 mg adderall red disks. Furthering this interpretation, the verse before that says the Weeknd is ""addied up, addied up"". This is basically is a type of speedball (where the most famous and possibly most dangerous / intense original is injecting a heroin and cocaine mix). The stimulant often adds talkativeness, alertness, and even more euphoria. And often boosts confidence. "

"Bollox to a rice cooker. 

If you have an electric cooker top (hob) like me, do this for basmati rice for with a curry:

* Put pan on hob and turn up full. Make sure you have a tight fitting lid for the pan. If you don't have a tight fitting lid, use a plate - just have a cloth handy to take it off again. 

* Throw in one hunka butter the size of two Jolly Ranchers. Let it melt a bit. 

* Throw in one cup of rice. Stir until all the grains are coated and glistening. Keep stirring until you can smell this delicious savoury rice aroma coming out of your saucepan. Only a minute or two. 

* Slowly pour in two cups of cold water. It will bubble and hiss, but you're a big boy who can cook his own damn rice. Also throw in some salt. As much as you can fit onto a teaspoon.

* Stir the rice just a bit. Pretty soon, you will see the first few bubbles from the water starting to boil. Give it one final swirl around with a spoon, put the tight fitting lid/plate on, and turn the cooker off completely. 

* Don't open the lid. Don't move the pot off the ring. 

* Continue to not open the lid and not move the pot off the ring for 15 minutes after first fitting the lid. But do ask Siri/Alexa/Google Now/Cortana to remind you when 15 minutes is up. 

* Once 15 minutes of not opening the lid has passed, open the lid. If your rice is brown, you might need an extra five minutes, ya goddamn hippie. 

* Et voila, rice for four people. 

You don't even need cup measures, just use a damn cup. Or a glass. Not a shot glass. And if you're a wannabe Ajit Pai, don't use your hilarious giant comedy mug. Also don't be a wannabe Ajit Pai, that guy's an asshat.

"Incompetent? LOL He killed Pope - the man noone dared to kill. He was the puppet of IRA and then he fucked them up. He also went against the Chinese mafia, Russia mafia and that huge drug cartel.

If Jax was incompetent, the Club would be 'dead' by Season 3 with every member of it into federal prison. Yes Jax took the Club to very dangerous paths (cartel, Pope, killings) but he was a strong leader. And he wasn't a good father. He was a fucking dangerous criminal boss. But he wasn't incompentent (criminalwise) by no means. An incompetent human being, yes."

I got pretty severely hurt at work in 2011. And was put on opiate pain killers, along with nerve mess (have significant nerve damage, which constantly sends ""PAIN!!"" messages to my brain)...

Until it got to the point where I didn't feel close to ""normal"" unless I had taken significant amount of the meds daily. Which would in turn lead me to run out early... u guys know the cycle here. 
- Anyway after almost 5 years I told the dr I wanted to get off them. He slowly tried tapering me down. Holy fuck. Worst time of my entire life. Acute Withdrawal lasted almost 13 days &amp; 5 months later I'm still not 100%. I still struggle literally every day dealing with being in constant pain. I'm not perfect, I've had a few slips.

"PCGS -  The #1 Coin-grading service for US Coins. Has a great reputation, but used to be better than it is now.

NGC - The #2 Coin Grading service. Much better for world coins, some think their US coin grades are more accurate. 

Both PCGS and NGC are expensive, and are also more trusted.

IGC and ANACS are cheap knock-off coin grading services that aren't seen as being as accurate. 

What coin grading services do is they authenticate coins and give them both a numerical grade on a scale of 1-70 and a letter grade on a scale of Poor (P) to Mint State (MS). You pay a fee, send your coins in, and they send them back in [tamper-proof plastic cases with the grade certification.](https://www.pcgs.com/images/articles/New-PCGS-Holder-700px.jpg)

PCGS and NGC generally grade coins accurately, ANACS and IGC have been accused of ""gradeflation"" - giving coins higher grades than they deserve to satisfy customers. 

The grades are as follows:

Poor (P) - 1 on a scale of 70

Fair (Fr) - 2

About Good (AG) - 3

Good (G) - between 4 and 7. Generally ""G"" is a 4 and ""G+"" is a 6

Very Good (VG) - between 8 and 14

Fine (F) - Between 15 and 29

Very Fine (VF) - Between 30 and 44

Extremely Fine (XF or EF) - Between 45 and 49

About Uncirculated (AU) - Between 50 and 59

Mint State (MS) - Between 60 and 70

Sometimes you will see holders that say PF (Proof) or BU (Brilliant Uncirculated). Proof refers to the manufacturing technique, not a grade. PF will be accompanied by a number between 1 and 70. BU is the same thing as Mint State, but less specific. It just means a coin is uncirculated. 

If the holder says ""Details"" after the grade, that means the coin is damaged (Scratches, holes, etc.). 

The grades for paper money (also done by PCGS, NGC, and a handful of smaller companies) are the same, except instead of Mint State it's Crisp Uncirculated (CU). 

The qualifications for each grade vary by coin and there's entire books dedicated to it. Generally a ""P-01"" coin will be an unrecognizeable circle of metal and a ""MS-70"" coin is completely flawless. MS-70 isn't really achievable because all coins get minor flaws in production, but Coin Grading services use it anyway. 

Also, every single number isn't used except for Mint State coins. There's no clear distinction between a G-04 and a G-05 coin, for example. The numbers you usually see are 01, 02, 03, 04, 06, 08, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 53, 55, 58, and all numbers between 60 and 70. "

"The X-Wings were going to be originally star fighters for the empire but the Emperor had disagreements with the company post the clone wars. The company was responsible for making all of the star fighters you see the clone army flying in Episode 3 (This is all considered canon). When you compare the 1st generations X-Wing to the tie fighters, it's very close to comparing the Japanese Mtsubishi zero (tie fighter) to the American P51 Mustang (X-Wing). The tie has no deflector shields, very little life support making the pilot wear a suit and personal life support and the weapons are weak but it has a faster attack and cruise speed than the X-Wing. The X-Wing has life support, Droid copilot, deflector shields, stronger weapons and can run entire missions solo making it great for scouting too. Really, Vader's tie advanced was comperable to an X-Wing.

"I can only speak to the United States but in nearly all cases they have to give current tenants 24 hour (or some amount of time depending on locality) notice to show their apartment. So, if they can just show it right away, they didn't give notice. This is usually a sign that they will treat you poorly if you move in.

While rare, just to give the benefit of the doubt, good landlords will sometimes request or declare certain days in advance that can be used for showing prospective renters the unit. But, this is typically with high demand units more likely to be in urban areas or  that cost a lot where they line up multiple showings in a day (think like an open house style schedule).

Bottom line: it's a ""red flag"" because it's probably a bad sign, even though it's at least possible that it's legit."

One of the ways I realized the ugly truth about stoners was when I met my most recent connection, he's a cool kid and all, but he lived with 4 literal stoner sterotypes (all college-aged white males), there was:

A, the introverted cynical gamer who constantly wears a black/red/yellow/green striped beanie and will talk your ear off about how much he hates the latest game he's currently working towards 100% completion 

B, the kid who has been smoking for far too long (like daily since he was twelve) to the point where he barely speaks at all, but will gladly sit in the circle and smoke half the bowl on his hit. He also somehow was working on an engineering degree, tho, at least

C, the wildcard, long-haired, gauged-ears, facial-piercing-having, concert-attending, ska-burnout lookalike. He would be more fun if he wasn't always making up words for smoking. 

and D, the other incredibly introverted guy ""who only smokes dabs"" and by that he means he ""only *buys* dabs"" and will gladly smoke your grass in the circle. Also the LSD connect of the group

Any time I went there to pick up, there was always someone else there picking up too, always in the exact niche as them, and always talking about other times they were *so high* from that other batch of dabs or that *whole tray of brownies* they ate or some shit. I occasionally stuck around for a bit after picking up, admittedly just for free weed, but the conversations were always mind-numbingly bland.

"It can get a little complicated. So think of it like this. Setting theme in Star was is futuristic fantasy. The only thing splitting scifi and it is how can you explain what is going on. Most of the star wars tech is super weird and straight out wouldn't work. Nobody even made an attempt to explain it, plus there is magic (the force). In scifi they try to explain everything at least in some terms, as it is supposed to be based on some science.

Now back to original question. Imagine a world which has a fantasy setting (Golarion, Ebberon, Faerun...) in them you can have a story which can be a horror, adventure, action, thriller...

You can in that case even change the setting (lets say to a steampunk) and still have a horror story. Setting is the background and story is the foreground.

So I was working for a major chain and our regional VP is supposed to make an appearance at the store on this one day, so everyone was nervous. 

Now, this one customer comes in and tells me he insists on getting a mimosa. It's 8:30 in the morning and we're not supposed to serve alcohol until 10:30. 

So I go get my manager and tell him and he told me to say no alcohol, which I tell the customer. The customer got pissed and asked to speak to the manager. At that point, the manager gave in and made a mimosa. He needed to get fresh champagne and orange juice out of the freezer because we didn't have it because we didn't serve mimosas.

This customer wasn't even my customer, so I stopped dealing with him for a while until i noticed that he was done with his plate, so I went up and asked if I could clear his plate for him. 

He leaned forward across the table and said ""If you take this plate, I will track you down when you go home and take off your arms with this steak knife.""

I smiled, thinking he was joking. He frowned and asked me what I thought was funny. 

So I went back to the server station and hid. I found out about an hour later that that was our VP. "

"This is the death of all tabletop games, this happens in warhammer and warmachine as well

""Rules lawyering"" 

I remember the popular one in Warhammer Fantasy was reforming to insane formations. 

For those not in the know warhammer fantasy is a tabletop game where all your units had to be ranked up.

Like this:https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/22/83/85/22838514360699192683e2b67e283c4c.jpg

Now certain abilities and spells gave these units a ""free"" reform which would allow a unit 5 wide by 4 deep (20 models) to go to say 10 wide by 2 deep. 

So what people would do is put their units in ridiculous formations, like say 1 wide and 40 deep (40models) or 40 wide and 1 deep specifically to get their units near objectives or spells. 

Now there was a rule meant to counter this that said a single model could not move more than double it's move speed in one turn. (As doing this maneuver would force a single model to move sometimes 4 or 5 times it's movespeed) however there was another rule that introduced the wording ""unlimited free reforms"" and thus began the debate on what exactly unlimited free reforms meant.

Thus two camps were born one with the, imho more realistic interpretation, which allowed unlimited reforms so long as they didn't move double their movespeed, and one which allowed these models to reform as many times as they wanted regardless of movespeed so long as the movement was considered a reform.

"We have several regulars who abuse 999. 


One of them goes through phases of calling countless times in a day, never speaking but you can hear she's there listening to us trying to get a response from her. Thing is when we go and arrest her she admits in interview that she knows it's wrong and could be preventing us from responding to an emergency, but still does it again a few days later.


Another calls police because he has mental health issues and doesn't like calling NHS 111 (non emergency medical line) and thinks police are nice, but then abuses us down the phone and refuses to accept any help or advice we offer. He's actually started calling 101 now rather than 999 as he thinks it'll keep him out of trouble. 


I had a woman the other night who called 999 and opened with ""okay two things"" which is never a good start. Proceeded to complain about a drunk man lying in the middle of the road shouting at people. I was actually aware of this already, it was an elderly male who'd slipped and broken his hip and had been calling out for help for an hour before someone called us and we got an officer/ambulance out there, so that pissed me off that she hadn't bothered helping him or calling earlier. Then she complained about someone parking in her parking space. Shut that one down pretty quickly.


Most annoying is the ones that start with ""it's not an emergency, but..."" they always know there's a non emergency line, but can't be bothered to wait to be spoken to! "

"Good teachers won't force the imagery, they will ask if you disagree to be able to explain yourself thoughtfully, but you need to be taught to get to that point first as a kid.

"When I was five, then I frequently wanted to do things and activities associated with the opposite gender such as painting my nails, playing dress up, etc, however, I was frequently shamed or not allowed to.

I didn't have dysphoria until I hit puberty, when my crushes on people weren't romantic or sexual, but we're more of a jealousy that I wasn't them and I had a strong desire to be another gender, I didn't know I was transgender then, but I knew I was something. I always got along better with females and frequently hung out with them instead of people of my own sex. I frequently had discomfort with masculine aspects of my body and it turned into severe depression.

It wasn't until I was an adult when I found out about being ""transgender"" and it hit. Since I came out then I'm a lot happier.

"We have family photos of my mom at about age 1 in 1956 with my Great-Great Granddad, who came to California with his family as a child on the California Trail in a covered wagon. 

Apparently he thought that supermarkets and McDonald's and cars were the coolest shit on earth, and it's a running joke that he died of a heart attack from eating too many burgers and milkshakes. 

It's unsurprising though: supermarkets were huge glass-fronted buildings full of refrigerators and freezers where you could buy any food your heart desired, including jars and cans of out-of-state or out-of-season produce. Glass windows were so expensive when he was a kid that only the filthy rich had them in their houses. Iceboxes didn't exist until he was a grown man with a family. Meat was obtained by his dad hunting for it, produce was from their yard, and there were lean years where hunting or the crops were shitty. 

And McDonald's and cars? Shiiiiiit. You hop in your horseless wagon, it takes you 15 minutes to get there instead of 3 hours by horse or whatever, you talk into a metal box, and in less than five minutes, a cute lil young thang bops over to your car, and for twenty five cents, you get a hot hamburger sandwich made with 100% beef, fried potatoes, and a *goddamn chocolate ice cream milkshake*? No wonder Granddad was hitting up McDonald's all the time! He was a tall and bulky dude, too, he could probably pack in quite a few 1955 McDonald's combos."

Everyone believes country people are racist white people. This assumption is common amongst people who have actually never lived in the country, but instead have only experienced it through media. Now, if they have indeed experienced it and attributed this act(s) to the general population of the south, that's blatant ignorance and arrogance. That's as if I'm saying all muslims from the Middle East are terrorist. It's just not true.

Woman gets raped and gets pregnant --&gt; Oh my God how awful she shouldn't be forced to have a kid! EDIT: Before the incoming hate storm, I absolutely agree that a raped woman should **not** be forced to have a kid. 

If you think that men should be held liable for child support when they were literally raped for the child to have been conceived, then I don't know how to better explain the position of MRA's around the world to you. No one cares about the child's best interests (except for those evil, slimy conservatives, right?) when the woman is the victim (even if she wasn't a victim, even if she accidentally got pregnant), so why does the child take priority over the male victim?

"My great-grandfather was a good man who wanted to be better than what he felt he was. But he was the son of a convicted murderer in a very small community in depression-era Georgia, and he couldn't escape his last name. His son, my grandfather, was a brilliant young student, but he was told by the local committee that managed college funds there was no way a McCullough was ever going to get a scholarship.

So ultimately, I think my great-grandfather felt that, based on the toxicity of his own relationship with his father, the best thing he could do for his children was to extract himself. So he took a job as a prison guard in another county. Ultimately, he took a train to California with another woman. Once there he called his wife and said he was sorry for everything, and a few days later he finally succumbed to health issues relating to his service in the first world war.

After he had left home, but before he went to California, his son went to a Junior College in the same area my great-grandfather was working. Seeing his father walking toward him, he crossed the street to avoid him. He hated himself for it the rest of his life, and never knew whether his father had seen him or not. 

He never saw him again."

When I saw this for the first time, there was an E for about a quarter of a second before disappearing and being replaced by the A. I thought I had broken the Matrix, that I had found evidence that the world was a simulation and that the Berenstein Bears were a glitch.

"Truthfully, the scary thing is China could turn the entire Kim dynasty to ash overnight with the flip of a switch, they just don't want to. NK is hopelessly dependent on China for basically everything, and serves as a buffer state between the US presence in SK and the Chinese mainland. A nuclear strike by NK would be immediately retaliated against in kind, which would spread fallout all over the peninsula and have a devastating effect throughout Asia. NK's job is to humiliate the US. China *wants* NK to develop the capability to hit the US, not to actually launch an attack, which would mean WW3, but to flaunt to the West that it *can*. China craves prestige on the world stage, and wants to tear down the US. Why do you think they keep applauding Haley and Tillerson's ""soft touch"" approach? Because it demonstrates American impotence, and calls China to a world leadership position to mediate the issue (that they are causing by protecting NK). What NK is saying and doing isn't scary, **doing it knowing they are a Chinese satellite state** is what's scary."

"We were camping up in Sleeping Bear Dunes, MI. It was night time and we're hanging around the fire, boozing it up and bullshitting. A DNR truck rolls up and the officer gets out and comes over to us. At the time we were all 18-19 years old so we thought we were gonna get MIPs or whatever. But instead he just asks if we've seen a black bear roaming around that day. Funnily enough, we had. Earlier that day we were fishing down the river near our campsite and there was a black bear about 50 yards from us on the other side of the river. We told him that. He asked us which way it went. We told him it went East. He then walks back to his truck and pulls out a rifle, hucks the rifle over his shoulder, and just walks into the woods, headed east. We're all sitting there like, wtf? About 40 minutes later we hear the echo of a gun shot. About 40 minutes after that he comes back, and loads his rifle into his truck. Before he left we asked him wtf that was about. Apparently this bear had been going around killing other bears and raping them and shit. It was tagged already so he tracked it and shot it dead. Strangest but one of most bad ass things I've seen."

3.Patience, lots of it. And I mean lots of it. Don't start grinding her after two minutes the first time. Slowly slide yourself in, stop if she's in pain, then wait for her to adjust before you slide a little further in. Once you are as far in, as she can handle, it might just be the tip the first time, then you can try pushing slowly back and forth, but don't ram her rear. Don't go deeper than that - next time you can go a bit deeper most likely. 

It might take a couple times for her to get adjusted and used to it, before you get to fill her out entirely. 

Remember, play with her, tease her, and she'll relax more, and have more fun with it.

Main points: listen to her sounds, make her relax and take it slow, also when you get excited.

Document. Everything. Every drop off and pick up. Every payment. Every phone call. I can't stress this enough. Document it and save peripheral proof if you can. If you had your kid over for the weekend, take a selfie with her and save the exif data proving she was there.

You *WILL* face a situation in the future where it is implied that whatever happened .. you had visitation, you picked up or dropped off on time, you went to s parent teacher conference, you paid child support .. it will be implied that the reality that happened, didn't happen. So document everything in order to prove what happened, happened.

Come to terms with a cold hard truth. If you're a white male heterosexual, no one is going to feel bad for you. You have no resources, no allies, no cultural urge to make sure you see justice. People don't particularly like us. I'm not saying that people hate whiteys? I'm just saying .. they don't particularly like us. A lot of people smirk when we falter. You'll feel like you're on your own.

Come to terms with this, soon. You cannot let your hurt feelings or emotions or stresses .. um, matter. They will exist but they can't be relevant. Become okay with this reality, quickly.  This will help you keep yourself from freaking out when someone shits on you. If you come to terms with it you won't freak out and yell ""HEY IM A HUMAN BEING DAMMIT!"" you'll just deal and think to yourself, yep, same old shit.

I'm sorry if that's harsh but it's critical to overcoming this.

"A good tip I've learned is to call an independent crematory directly. They typically don't do services, they just make money by cremating. Cremation itself isn't expensive. The cost should be about $600-$800. They give you the ashes in a bag in a box. 

An urn is not some special device that needs to be expensive. You can use whatever you want as an urn. Buy something from Home Goods or Pier 1. 

If your loved one was in the military, the Coast Guard will take you and a handful of your family on a boat to spread the ashes at sea for no cost. You just have to go on their schedule. 

If you cremate, you don't need a funeral home. Have a get together at a park, restaurant, chapel, wherever. No products or services will be forced on you."

"""Passengers"", and *everyone* on the ship is asleep.

I don't care how good or advanced your tech is, shit's gonna break down.  Also, they mention an involved process of preparing people for hibernation; why not have the same tech aboard so you can wake people up as needed?  You only need a setup to do one at a time, not like hundreds or all 5000 at once.

The ending also bothered me.  If I were the screenwriter, when the crew wakes up, the captain asks for the ship's status.  The computer responds with something like:

""The ship is withing operating limits.  5,053 passengers are in good condition.""

Of course, the captain is startled by the extra 53.  He and the crew go to the concourse, see the huge tree and other plant growth, and are met by the descendants of Pratt's and Lawrence's characters.

With 80+ years to go, it seems unlikely they would prevent any and all pregnancy.  Have 3-5 kids, and then when each reaches 21 or so, wake up another passenger (specifically, one whose skills would be useful *during* the voyage; had Pratt's character not been an electronics tech, he would never have gotten the other pod open).  

Give that passenger the choice of staying awake and becoming a member of the family, or put them into status in that single medical pod.  However, they wouldn't be able to make their choice for 3 months.  After 3 months with the extended family everyone who was awakened chose to stay awake."

They are usually first and foremost for hunting, protecting your herd, and for recreation. Most interactions with guns are positive events and gun crime is mainly talked about as a city problem. 

So when it comes to gun control people in the city who are more exposed to gun violence and news involving gun violence see it as a much larger problem than people in the country. 

It's one of the reasons why I personally think us Dems need to drop gun control if we want to start winning back the rural areas. (Also it seems like once we end the war on drugs, revitalize inner cities, and make sure people see a way up and out of poverty then gun crime should drop anyways.) "

Mao's [Great Leap Forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward) (of which the sparrow campaign was a part of). There were also campaigns that caused inadequate irrigation problems, too deep plowing and farmers making ""quality steel"" in their backyards.   
Mao's [Hundred Flowers Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign), where the Communist party thought, it's a good idea to let thinking people give their opinions about the communist regime. Guess what - they didn't like it. So anyone criticizing communism was imprisoned and/or sent to labor camps.  
Mao's [Cultural revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution). Around .5 to 8 million people killed, probably tens of millions persecuted, schools shut down, chaos all around and the country's economy stunted for decades.

Meme Boi drew a swastika over German kid's flag and fought him there and then for being a Nazi.

"Yes, people were getting sick 30 years ago before the science caught up.

My mom was born with Celiac's. Outside of some weird sicknesses growing up, it wasn't obvious.  But then the trail of miscarriages and the serious medical issues in her thirties and forties that left her bedridden for much of my childhood went away when a doctor finally tested her for celiac.

She's had no relapses since.

They didn't test for it until about 20 years ago.

About five years ago it caught on as a health food hipster detox craze because we are dumb fuckers, scienceless fuckers now.  This has been a double edged sword because on the one hand there are now tons of products and things that used to use gluten as a spice binder now exclude it or are labeled better.  But it also has people inventing shit like ""gluten friendly"" which means they don't follow the allergen laws because gluten hipsters are faking it.

"Criminal Law:
There is no justice. 

•Plea deals are largely determined by the mood of the prosecutor or their schedule at the time. 
•The innocent are more likely to plead guilty than the guilty, because they generally have more to lose at trial.
•Judges are surprisingly weak on the law. 
•Jurors are incredibly unreliable. 
•Prosecutors swear to uphold justice but are compelled to seek convictions. 
•There is almost never a penalty of any kind for state witnesses, police or prosecutors who lie, even under oath. 
•The rich skirt the system, the poor are destroyed by it. 

In short: Every negative thing you've ever heard about the criminal justice system is true."

"It's a little more subtle than that. In Nazi doctrine the Jews were considered so low they were unworthy of live itself, they were to be eradicated like you would vermin or other pests. They even made a famous propaganda movie comparing Jews to rats, the argument being that both species essentially profited of the hard work of ""real humans"" while bringing nothing but disease like the Plague.

Slavs were ranked just barely higher than that, they were to be removed second but instead of extermination like with the Jews the Slavs were to be enslaved and then worked and starved to death in service of the Reich. The lands they left behind in Eastern Europe would then be populated by Aryan German farming families as Lebensraum.

This was mostly just policy though, in practice the two races were treated essentially the same: Those that couldn't work were exterminated and those that could worked until they couldn't work anymore. "

Fill a bathtub with water. Get an empty jar with an airtight lid. Sit in the tub with the jar. Submerge the jar making sure all of the air comes out. Hold the jar upside down, underwater, in a position that will catch your fart. I pressed it into the crease between my junk and my thigh. Fart. If done correctly, the fart will float up into the jar. Now bring the lid underwater, and make sure no air is left in the lid. Screw the lid onto the jar tightly. You now have 100% pure fart in a jar, and some water. Next time, bring the jar underwater and hold it upside down before removing the lid. When you get to the very end, it helps to have a second jar so that you can carefully ""pour"" fart into the nearly full jar. Affix the lid. Like I said earlier, some water droplets are unavoidable.

Either way, if he was *really* trying to promote the ""don't believe everything they tell you"" narrative, he still went about it in the stupidest way possible.

"I worked at a boutique food shop for a while, one that's main focus was imported cheeses, fine wines, cutlery, you know, all way over priced stuff (think of were Frasier Crane would shop).

There was always this guy that would buy ALL of our gallons of this specific Italian olive oil.  Never special ordered it, never went to somewhere else, never made a request to hold it, he'd just show up once or twice a week and buy everything we had, always leaving maybe 2-3 bottles (maybe he was considerate to other customers?)  

This stuff that at a normal store would run 20 dollars a bottle but we resold it at 3x that much.  He still kept coming in and buying mass quantities of individual gallons even after I told him a wholesaler could get it to him in bulk, shipped, and far cheaper. 

This guy was kind of a tall lanky geeky young guy, maybe 20-25 years old.  One time I asked him if he owned or worked in the restaurant or food business, he dismissively said ""No. I don't"" and his tone was somewhat awkward when he said it, and that was the last time I asked him about it. 

This went on for the entire 2 years I worked there.  He must of bought nearly $100k worth of this Olive oil, if I added it up over the 2 years I worked there...and I'm sure he kept coming after I quit. 

60$ a gallon, 14 gallons (sometimes more, sometimes less depending on stock) a week, for 2 years. 

To this day I really, really fucking want to know where all this olive oil was going and why he was so specific about buying it in the way he did.

It of course became a running joke (lighthearted) whenever he'd come in, only other purchase I ever saw him make is ONE time he bought a bottle of sparkling water.

I still think about it every once and a while.  I'll never get an explanation and it drives me nuts. "

"Since I was a kid my parents (especially my dad) were very open about sexuality and explained everything to me and my siblings... even when we accidentally found porn at a pretty young age, our dad proceeded to explain to us what exactly was going on. As a result, I've always been very comfortable with sex in general and was never obsessed with it growing up as a lot of kids around me were (the same happened with drugs, my parents were so open about it that I was never attracted to it because it wasn't some kind of forbidden fruit to me. I started smoking weed in my early twenties and I'm glad I didn't start as a teenager, as I think I have a pretty healthy relationship to it). It also still makes me think that no, kids are not shocked or distraught by sex in general, and I don't think it's necessary to ""protect"" them from knowing about sex, although it's my humble opinion and I have no scientific knowledge on the matter. 
Then, a few years ago I came out to my parents, and although I always grew up hearing ""it's ok to be gay, we'll love you just the same"", their reaction was definitely not the one I expected. I guess I thought they were just going to say ""yeah that's cool"", but instead my mom kind of had a weird reaction at first (which I don't blame her for, as it was a honest reaction to something she doesn't know anything about), and my dad's was a weird mix of ""I had a few gay experiences when I was younger and I wasn't into it"" and ""it's probably some sort of subconscious choice, you've always liked being different"".... It made me realize than even though they were really open about sex, they were truly ignorant about homosexuality. I never ever blame people for being ignorant, because I think we can't blame someone for not knowing something, however I do blame people who are unapologetic about their ignorance, or show no desire to educate themselves. So I just had a few conversations to my parents about it and it didn't take long for them to fully understand why I was distraught by their initial reaction and educate them about what it is and how it feels to be gay. 
I'm extremely grateful to have parents who are open about literally everything and always chose conversation and understanding over enforcing strict rules and trying to hide the world from us. Now that I am in  serious relationship, I always try to talk things through with my partner, we rarely fight,  have a very healthy relationship and I can thank my parents for that. 

sorry for the dodgy english as it is not my first language!"
"I was told she was batshit crazy when we met - her old friends told me that she would wait outside of her ex's house and cry, or post his personal things onto facebook. I asked her and she told me that it was a lie and her ex had been physically abusive to her. At first things were ok, I dismissed a lot of her weird mannerisms to her trauma from her previous relationship. Then things got worse.. losing it at me for not replying for 1-2 hours, yelling at me infront of my family and friends for looking/talking to a female friend. I just kept telling myself it was because of her passed. Oh man, I really tried to help her.. I helped her get into counseling, I even started a whole charitable foundation that helps those facing domestic abuse for her. It just kept getting worse and worse to the point where she would be cussing me out in-front of my family weekly, and one night she drunkenly hit me.. I was drunk too and had to hold her to make her stop, which made me feel bad because I firmly believe a man shouldn't ever be physical with a girl. I dont know why I kept forgiving her even though she would do this regularly and would wait outside my house, and refuse to leave when inside. A few times I had to call her dad to come get her. She always blamed it on alcohol, her previous abuse, or said I would forgive her once 'she made me feel good' - I ended it after that, but we saw each other a few times after. The last straw was when she met me for dinner (we had already broken up) already drunk, and started yelling at me. When I tried to leave after paying the tab, she chased me outside - clinging onto the outside of my pickup truck while I tried to drive. As soon as I stopped she got in and almost made me crash 3-4 times. The only reason she left me alone was because that night I was smart enough to video tape her beating me, ripping my clothes off, biting me, and told her I would be sending them to her family and friends if she ever contacted me again. Im not the best man - but no one deserves to be treated like that.. I still run the charity for domestic abuse. Stay Strong Folks! "

Between 8th grade and 11th it got to the point I'd punch trees until the bark was off and the wood was stained with blood. I'd black out and beat the shit out of people over trivial things.

Now I can stay calm in most situations. It takes time and practice, but you can do it!"

What's an 18 year old doing with a 45 year old
"you're going down in r/KarmaCourt, bitch"
"My 12th grade history teacher was a very good looking, 30-ish man. I would not say that he flirted with the girls so much as he didn't try very hard to discourage them from flirting with him. As 17 year olds, myself and my best friend would sometimes cast each other wide eyed glances and giggle at some of the obvious flirting that he really should have shut down. But that was not as shocking as his hair trigger anger. As is the case with adolescent boys, there were a couple of incidents of class room, boys will be boys, shenanigans that pissed him off. He never lost it outright, but he would go from zero to red faced shaking barely contained rage, instantly. No build up or gradually increasing irritation but instant red faced rage. But it was the way he encouraged the flirting by means of not discouraging it that me and my bf were sure would be his eventual undoing. We used to talk about how long it would be before he got busted for plowing a student. But we were wrong.

A couple of years after we graduated, he got transferred to a coaching position. Not long after that, he was fired. It turns out his anger got the best of him, because he lost it one day and ended up beating the shit out of one of his students (male). I don't recall the details but the teacher lost his temper and hit the kid, who hit him back, and it was on. The principal was called and he was the one who broke up the fight. 

In retrospect, it was really not all that surprising. As an adult, if I were to witness today, his reaction to the classroom clowns in history class, I would know right away that he was a catastrophe waiting to happen. The guy was a fucking powder keg."

"From a female perspective,  if she has shown no romantic interest in those two years it's safe to assume she just wants to be friends. I don't want to discourage you but it most likely would ruin your friendship if you were to make a move. A good male friend of mine did this a few years ago and we don't speak any more. I hope this helps. "

After mine are gone, I'm tearing up the carpet in their playroom and will probably have to replace the closet doors too. My smartest rat figured out how to open the doors, let the others through, and they had a grand time digging through/destroying stored items. I contrived to block the doors but that rat still remembers there's a closet full of wonders, six months later. He still digs and chews furiously at the closet doors trying to open them. 

That one is wicked smart. It's always amazing to develop a unique communication style with your pet. When he's tired of playing in a room, he'll clamber onto my shoulder to let me know he's ready to go. He won't do it if I'm wearing a tank top because his claws hurt, so in that case he'll sit in my lap and stare at my shoulder until I put on a jacket."

His killing of numerous turtles and goombas just because they are simply walking (or flying) in his path. And furthermore, his destruction of property and theft of coins would land him in the slammer in the real world.

He jumps in the water defying science by throwing fireballs at fish and then doesn't even eat the fish. When all is said and done he just assumes the Princess wanted to be rescued when she could have been really trying to run from him the entire time. That monster."

Wrex is a strong, enlightened leader who wants to move past the Krogan's violent tendencies and join the galactic community as respected equals.  Wreav, who takes over if Wrex is killed, is 100% intent on revenge for the way the galaxy treated the Krogan.  It's made very clear that, without the Genophage, the Krogan *will* have the numbers to completely overwhelm the rest of the galaxy if they choose to.  There's no quick, obvious answer, since you're basically deciding against a cruel, incomplete genocide in the immediate future, or a destructive galactic war in a few generations."

And I'm paraphrasing as I can't find it again as I once did but its essentially: ""You didn't exist before you were born, who's to say you won't exist again after you're dead?""

Why it gives me such relief is the sheer logical reasoning behind it. There is no do this or God will send you into hellfire or be good so when you are reincarnated you will have an even better life. We have no choice in the hand we're dealt its all chaos, but knowing that logically we can exist again because we do now may be what little pattern there is.

"2 of our cats have successfully figured out the round doorknobs. They love to sneak into our guest room (the sun hits it just right in the afternoon, so they like to laze on the bed in there). 

The only problem is that to get into the room, they have to push the door open which is easy. But the door often swings closed when the AC kicks on, so they get stuck in the room and can't get out because they have to pull the door open from the inside. They've figured out that if one of them rotates the handle, while another sticks their paws under the door to pull it, the door will eventually open.

I spun around once and shouted to my co-workers that our chairs spin really well. So I did a really big wind up and managed to get 4.5 revolutions before my chair stopped. 

I was so nauseated and dizzy that I had to put my head down on my desk for the remaining hour and a half of work. And then the rest of the day I was just nauseous and sick so I spent my Friday night at home in the dark with a pillow over my head to block out any sounds. "

"He was being heavily bullied in the dinner line so he pulled out a flick knife (switch blade for you heathens) and tried to slash someone. That someone being me. I, heroically, tackled this violent issue by running off. 

He chased me but I was faster. He stopped and went back to try to stab someone else but a teacher grabbed him and took the knife off him. He then pulled another flick knife from his other pocket and attempted to stab the teacher. Because if you're going to become stabby you may as well double down and become Stabby McStabberson. He actually knicked the teacher before he managed to bundle Stabbers to the ground. Another teacher got the 2nd knife off of him.

Police were called, parents were called and we never saw him at school again. We did, however, see his older brothers the next day when they decided that they would visit the school and try to stab the teachers. They were also arrested.

No, I wasn't bullying him. I was actually his friend...or so I thought. The person next to/behind me did shout something. Later on, about 10 years, I saw him and asked him why he tried to stab me and he thought I was the one who shouted at him. He thought I'd turned on him and that was the last straw for him so he got stabby."

Typically teams only come out in a victory formation when there's no way for the opposing team to stop the clock, and the team with possession is up by (usually) multiple scores.

It took minutes until he was unconscious. I can't even begin to imagine in what kind of pain he was in because that man was not afraid of anything his entire life. A couple of years prior he walked himself to his GP while having a heart attack so severe he needed emergency surgery with multiple bypasses right after, all the while insisting it wasn't that serious.

He died the next day. His last conscious minutes were pain and fear and suffering.

"Exactly. Of all the flaws in the movie, this isn't one of them. Can you imagine how expensive it must be to own a resort/amusement park on an island? Plumbing, maintenance, hotel labor, transportation: all tripled in price for being in a remote location. Now throw in having literally the best scientists in the world, working in entertainment. Those paychecks aren't cheap. But wait, they have dinosaurs.... fucking dinosaurs... the amount of food, captivity, security, labor, and lawsuits in dollars must be in the hundreds of millions (super modest estimate) alone. But hey, at least they can charge whatever they want for a trip right? Except the owner's main focus is letting everyone experience the new world they've created and is probably charging just enough that over half of the population can still go, if that. Let's not forget their useless R&amp;D to make self-driving sci-fi balls for no reason plus whatever other kooky crap they've cooked up. On top of all of that, they got motherfucking Jimmy Fallon to do all of their videos, and we all know Jimmy ain't cheap. So they're spending would be in the tens of billions hands down... my question is how are they making money. They really sell over ten millions rooms for a grand a pop? We'll pretend Jurassic park is Disney; disney has around 31,000 hotel rooms × 365 days a year = ~11,000,000 hotel rooms/year. The average cost is 150 a day per family (total spending) but to be safe we'll triple it for pure gross revenue. That's about six billion per year if they sell out every day. So if they were disney maybe we could make a case for it.... but Jurassic park had one (?) hotel. So maybe that's 2000 rooms max? Come on the numbers don't add up."

"Michael B. Jordan is kind of a chill funny dude at work. He's not the serious ""don't make eye contact"" with type of actor in my experience which was the opposite of Michael Shannon, Walton Goggins (who is actually lovely in real life just not when on set in character), or DiCaprio. I get it though. It's work. They have to be those people for whichever character they're playing so I don't hold anything against them. Scott Eastwood is also really nice and friendly to people overall. I thought he would be more of a ""don't you know who my father is"" kind of dude to work with. Danny Glover is the shit! I thought he would be all old man angry but he is SO nice and friendly to the crew even willing to take photos on set instead of booking it to the airport asap. 

John Lithgow was funny. We got stuck in a location during a take and had to seek a hiding spot as the director said action, haha. Oh!

"My friend group used to be kind of a trio (we'll call them Al and Bob).  We met because of our mutual friend (Al)(whom I've known my whole life, like walk in the front door, no issues).  After Al died in a car accident, we would hang around his parents and be supportive and just try to make things feel normal.  

Well Bob got in an argument with Al's parents because they voted for a president that Bob didn't like.  He stopped responding to Al's mom's text messages completely.  We get together on Al's birthday and death day, and Al's mom is always nice about reaching out to Bob saying ""hey if you feel like it, you should stop by"", very inviting.  He doesn't respond, and he stopped responding to me.  

He posts pictures all over social media on those days of him partying or going to some weird event.  

I don't care how Bob feels, it's Al's goddam mom.  We were 24 when he died.  It kills me every time I go there.  But I don't give a shit because it's his mom.

"You _will_ start to feel better. You will. 

It might take days, weeks, months. But there'll be one day where you wake up and get out of bed right away. Or you'll wake up and decide to shower and make breakfast. And from there on, it'll get better. 

You'll get to a point where you're doing well and you'll look back on what made you start to feel better. It might not even be a concrete thing - you might not be able to track what it was that you did. And that's fine. 

Fighting depression will always be a war and it may seem like you'll never win and it'll end in a stalemate. But that one day, where you decide to do a minor task - that seemed so impossible before - is the day everything will turn around for the better. You'll eventually realize you aren't so sad and apathetic anymore, and when you do, it's as if you've shed your winter coat and you're free of this oppressive, stagnant weight on your shoulders. 

It gets better. "

"Any time the plural form of the noun is the same as the singular form, there can be ambiguity. Granted, that's contrived, but it's still real. For example:

I eat less fish. (I am slowly cutting fish out of my diet)

I eat fewer fish. (I am narrowing the types of fish I eat, but the overall amount of fish I eat might be unchanged)

I think I reared too much buffalo (I am concerned about the amount of buffalo I grew on my farm, in terms akin to biomass).

I think I reared to many buffalo (I am specifically concerned with the number of buffalo I grew on my farm).

We had to be careful not to catch too many trout, or the game warden would fine us (we could only catch up to a certain number of trout)

There's even examples where it can be ambiguous without that plural/singular property. For example:

I enjoy learning about currencies. I don't yet know too much. (I don't yet know much about the economics behind currencies)

I enjoy learning about currencies. I don't yet know too many. (I can't recite a long list of individual currencies)

"The three major kinds of 'static' noise are white, pink, and brown.  White noise means that each frequency has the same volume.  Pink noise means that each octave has the same total sound energy, which means that as frequency gets higher the volume actually decreases.

Pink noise sounds most 'balanced' to most people."

"People have ""filter bubbles"". This concept isn't new, but having a term for it is thanks to social media. 

It's simply that we all tend to associate with people who share common interests and similarity to us. If you're into sports, it's likely that your friends are too. If you detest sports, your friends probably aren't season ticket holders.

The most effective form of marketing for any company is word-of-mouth. No ad campaign comes close to being as effective as all of your friends recommending something to you.

Putting the two things together is the reason for these trends. Lesbians tend to have lesbian friends, and when someone asked for suggestions on what car to get, their friends suggested a Subaru. That person is more likely to tell their friends, and their friends are more likely than average to be lesbians.  "

"I understand historians desire to paint WW1 as a meat grinder, where we simply threw wave after wave of men. It effectively paints the horrors of the battles that took place. However, I feel it does a disservice to what actually happened. 

WW1 was the first major war faught with ""modern"" weapons. These weapons were both way more powerful than weapons which came before, and way less powerful than a lot of people realized. The generals in WW1 did keep trying new things. When a plan didn't work, they tried something new. However, the results of what they tried ended up being the same. This is because they were trying to figure out how to fight with all the new weapons. They tried standing barrages, walking barrages, diversionary barrages, etc. When they didn't work, it became the same meat grinder. 

What I think are the two take aways from this is 1.) We have to remember people from the past weren't stupid. They too could learn from their mistakes and 2.) It's important in combat (and really all fields) to remember a new technology isn't a solve all for your problems. "

"The New Life Children’s Refuge case was a legal case about an incident which occurred in the chaotic aftermath of the January 12th 2010 Haiti earthquake. On January 29, 2010, a group of ten American Baptist missionaries from Idaho attempted to cross the Haiti-Dominican Republic border with 33 Haitian children, most of whom were not orphans and had families. The group, known as the New Life Children’s Refuge, did not have proper authorization for transporting the children and were arrested on child trafficking charges. The missionaries denied any wrongdoing and claimed that they were rescuing orphans and leading them to a Dominican hotel which was being transformed into an orphanage. Nine of the ten missionaries were later released but NLCR founder ***Laura Silsby*** remained incarcerated in Haiti. By the time she went to trial on May 13 the charges had been reduced to ""arranging irregular travel"" and the prosecution sought a 6-month prison term. On May 17, she was found guilty and sentenced to the time served in jail prior to the trial.

Jorge Puello, a Dominican legal advisor who was hired by the relatives of the 10 American missionaries detained in Haiti, was arrested Thursday in the Dominican Republic. He was wanted in both the United States and El Salvador on human smuggling accusations. He was sentenced to 37 months of prison in June 2011.

Silsby (currently?) works as the Vice President of Marketing at AlertSense, a company which provides software for the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, including the AMBER Alert system...a system that informs the public of missing children in urgent need of detection.

All that is way too many coincidences to ignore. I think there's something coordinated in effect with some of the missing children in the US and higher ups are aware..."

"[The Rosenhan Experiment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment)  The second part was even scarier.

&gt; The second part of his study involved an offended hospital administration challenging Rosenhan to send pseudopatients to its facility, whom its staff would then detect. Rosenhan agreed and in the following weeks out of 193 new patients the staff identified 41 as potential pseudopatients, with 19 of these receiving suspicion from at least one psychiatrist and one other staff member. In fact, Rosenhan had sent no pseudopatients to the hospital."
"Psychopathic? I think now you're just throwing words around to justify your position. Not that your position is wrong, but Joel is clearly not a psychopath, he genuinely cares for Ellie and Tess and his brother etc. Did he kill a bunch of people? Yeah, he did, but remorseless killing in those situations (Zombie apocalypse, nearly everyone trying to kill you, your companion being taken by unknown people (who tried to kill both of you earlier...), and trekking across the country with someone who you've grown to love like your own daughter only to see her drown then taken *again* by the people who you were trying to help, who won't let you say goodbye before killing her on the off chance a vaccine could be made) is way more justified than you're making it out to be. The guy has been through a lot of shit in the twenty years before the game. He has to be hard, but he's definitely not a psychopath. Psychopaths feel nothing for people, and just see them as game pieces to be manipulated. If Joel were a psychopath, he probably *would* have left Ellie because he wouldn't care for her. Doing what you think was the wrong thing doesn't make him a psychopath. I mean, he is shown to struggle with the decision in the epilogue. There are no easy decisions in the zombie apocalypse dude, and if you're saying that you would have gone through all of that and not tried to save Ellie, I don't think you understand what it's like to bond with someone that closely. 

Should Joel have let the fireflies do their thing? I don't know. But looking at it from the perspective of someone who has played the game way too many times, I don't think the fireflies had the capability to do what they said they were going to, at least not without any sort of practice. Having doctors doesn't equate to having skilled doctors. Having equipment doesn't equate to having the right equipment. Having a patient who is immune doesn't equate to being able to make a cure, especially if you only have the one patient *and you need to kill her.* If she died and they didn't successfully make a cure based on their first analysis, well they're fresh out of luck. There's a lot more to the cure than figuring out the mutation in the cordycep, I mean, that shit was wrapped around her brain stem. Her body has to be doing something to keep living like that. And they planned to produce vaccines from knowledge about a mutation?? Sounds like a long shot in the dark. I'm not any kind of expert in biology and certainly not in producing cures, but from what I do know, the chances they'd produce an actual cure from what they have are pretty low. 

Also Marlene was not an old friend. He knew of her, she knew of him and then she hired him to take a kid cross-country. The only connection is Joel's brother. If you're not talking about Marlene, I don't know who you're talking about when you say ""one an old friend.""    "

"Honestly, Asgore is one of the best bosses thematically I've ever seen. The entire area leading up to him, the first few rooms where you follow him, are all part of what makes that fight just that much more intense.

Asgore doesn't *want* to fight you. He just sees no other way, no other option to achieve his goal- keeping his people hopeful for the future. His peoples' hopes and dreams vanished with the deaths of his son and Chara. Their hopes for a better future where monsters and humans could live together, gone. Regardless of the truth of who Chara really was, the regular citizens of the Underworld saw him as a ray of light shining through the darkness.

To reignite that hope and keep them moving forward, Asgore declared war on humans. He doesn't want to fight but truly believes it is the only choice to keep his people together and hopeful. He believes in that truth so much that he chose that path over his wife. He's a 'villain' because he opposes you, not because he himself is a bad guy. 

Asgore is the boss you don't want to fight but must. It makes the battle that much more intense, because you lose even if you win, in a way, because in another light, *you* are the villain."

"My SO has chewed with his mouth open the whole two years I've known him. I never knew how to bring it up without embarrassing him and since it didn't bother me that much, I just let it slide. But every time we had dinner with my parents, I suddenly became hyper-aware of it and would get irrationally annoyed and disgusted that he doesn't just close his damn mouth when he chews!

But not everyone was drilled to learn proper table manners by an Army colonel father through their whole childhood.

"As always, this is relevant.

The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. 

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.

One of the biggest misconceptions, if you can call it that, is that mental illness should either be approached (1) in the same way as something like a virus or a bacterial infection, or something like that, or that (2) it is totally different. The truth is that its its own thing, and kind of resembles some things in some ways, but not others in other ways.

The truth is that the traditional categories of mental illness are poorly framed. It's more like you have problems, and some are more chronic, and some are more acute. And in different ways for different people.

Personality disorder and other things like bipolar disorder are all forms of psychopathology, or mental illness, in the sense of being mentally unwell or unhealthy, or needing help or intervention. I think any other distinctions are fuzzy and imprecise. "

1. We treated Vietnam veterans atrociously, even though a large number of them were draftees. They didn't choose to be sent overseas, and we still called them babykillers. The shame from that has made us go the other way.

"The British were way too paranoid and meticulous to let anything like that happen. They judged plenty to be untrustworthy and didn't use them - they just went silent, not a surprise for sending spies into an enemy country. Even for those who they trusted had given them the right communication protocol, they mostly just had their handler take over the telegraphy and consulted with the subject if they needed to make sure not to tip their hand. After all, it's not like these spies travelled back and forth across the channel during wartime; it was usually done by radio telegraphy.

Not to mention that most of these spies were 'captured' because they immediately turned themselves in. There wasn't a rigorous recruitment process; the German intelligence services took a 'quantity-over-quality' approach and in many cases just recruited somebody, gave them a radio set, snuck them in, and hoped for the best. Lots of people signed up to get to the safety of England, or to have an opportunity to fight the Germans.

They would also have known almost immediately whether a source had been compromised because of the codebreakers on the Enigma project at Bletchley. The British ability to read German communications only increased as the war went on, so if somebody wasn't genuine, they'd hear about it - and in fact this is how they found some German agents in the first place. That's what made the system so effective; the double cross agents were a means to input misinformation, the effects of which could be reliably observed. Over time as they learned what sources were trusted and which weren't, they could prepare greater misinformation by disseminating it through multiple trusted sources at once, like they did before the Normandy invasion.

More interestingly, Hitler had a tendency to play various agencies off against each other so that they'd be too occupied fighting for his favour to plot against him. This meant that the appearance of results was more important to the Abwehr than actual truth - so even if they suspected something was wrong, they had an interest in covering that up, because it would make them look bad. The Third Reich's bureaucracy had a lot of problems like this.

The main reason the British were so successful is a combination of how professional and cautious they were (they never assumed that they had caught all the German spies, that was determined years after the war had ended), and how unprofessional and careless the Germans were. One of the reasons its like is unlikely to be seen again; people understand how important intelligence services can be now."

"I'm a chef with a focus on culinary education, and one of the first and foremost lessons we teach people is flavor structure. It's a really simple, but not necessarily immediately intuitive seasoning strategy.

The key flavors are: Salty, sweet, savory (umami), sour (acidity), and bitter.

It's about learning how to use all of them, and balance. Your lemon caper sauce for your fish is too acidic and pungent? Add a pinch of sugar. Yes, even on a savory dish. Your dessert is flat and bland? Add salt. Salt makes food taste more like itself, even on a sweet dish. Your Thai curry is too sweet(sugar)? Add more lime juice(acid). Too bland? Add fish sauce (salt AND umami). And if you're really missing that savory bite, add a little MSG, which is basically savory isolate (NO MSG IS NOT INHERENTLY BAD FOR YOU, FUCKING FIGHT ME.)

There's a reason traditional Italian bolognese has sugar in it, because tomatoes and wine are very high in acid. You bring it back, and ultimately elevate it with sugar. Ragu made with certain game meats are often braised with espresso (bitter), because it adds depth, and will ultimately get balanced out, salt, acidity (tomatoes and wine), and sweetness (sugar).

Thai curry and beurre blanc are really great examples of how to demonstrate this.

Then it comes down to depth. Layering flavors. Salsa verde, for example; has dark roasted garlic and onion in it. And then when you're blending it, you add raw garlic and onion. You boil your tomatillos with lime juice and cilantro, and then add fresh lime juice and cilantro when it's done. It adds layers of flavor. Depth. Then after all that lime juice(acid), you balance out that depth with sugar.

"It's more of a reflection of the society or general company that people keep.

I hang around with a group of people who would never sleep with someone on a first date, and would rather wait till marriage. In that context, the idea of ""demisexual"" (or the other comment, ""I only date people after I get to know them"") seems nonsensical. But if you're a high schooler, stuck together with a bunch of people who (claim they) are having sex at every provocation, or watching/reading a lot of media where sex is initiated with barely more than a shared look, then feeling that ""I like to wait before having sex"" is a special and unique position seems more understandable."

I couldn't just go to a friend's house, dates and times had to be planned days in advance and I could only go to another person's house if the parents were there, and mine would usually call ahead to make sure they knew I was coming and that they would be there.

"&gt;Shortly thereafter, either the original claimant or someone arguing on his behalf will say something like ""Appeal to authority is a logical fallacy!"" and get hundreds of upvotes.

Funny enough, this is known as [the fallacy fallacy]
(http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fallacy_fallacy). 

&gt;The fallacy fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs when it is claimed that if an argument contains a logical fallacy, the proposition it was used to support is wrong. A true statement can be defended using false logic, so using false logic to defend an opinion is not proof of the opinion being wrong. This is where one needs to make a clear distinction between ""sound"", ""valid"" (including the distinction between scientific validity and logical validity) and ""true"", instead of taking all of them as synonymous.

Just naming a logical fallacy used in an argument isn't a valid refutation of that argument.

Another common fallacy committed on Reddit is the [appeal to dictionary fallacy](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_dictionarium).

&gt;Argumentum ad dictionarium is the act of pulling out a dictionary to support your assertions. More broadly speaking it can refer to any argument about definitions, semantics, or what label to apply to a person or idea - an actual dictionary may not be involved, sometimes the definition is purely personal, sometimes it can be a case of picking and choosing definitions raised by other sources,[2] but the end use is the same. For the most part, ""dictionary"" is used as a short-cut to refer to any source of these definitions, including statement such as ""well, if I define X like this..."", which is possibly the most asinine form of the fallacy. See, we've already had to head off one use of this fallacy already in case someone says ""it's not this fallacy because I'm not using a dictionary""!

Dictionaries don't reason, they simply offer short definitions according to authors at the time of their writing. Using a dictionary as proof also assumes that a word can not have another or expanded meaning and that the authors of the dictionary are the ultimate authorities on all words and concepts, which is of course ridiculous. I see this one on Reddit constantly."

"Don't feel bad dude, the thought of sober sex freaked me out as well at first. I was *always* drunk for any sexual encounters I had, sometimes I was high on painkillers and sometimes it was meth. Being under the influence helped ease any shyness or anxiety I felt leading up to sex and any I felt during. Having a sober sexual encounter after having that safety blanket for so long is scary. It's like taking the training wheels off a bike. Eventually, you do learn to have satisfying sober sex again. "

Roma have very strict rules about what activities are seen as clean or unclean and to be unclean in the presence of Roma, especially in their home, is extremely offensive.

I know that sounds very pejorative but it just means non-romani need to be purified because they live outside of romani traveling life.

Because as a traveling culture, food and the money to purchase it can be a scarcity sometimes so it's treated with great reverence. To use it in an unclean manner is too offensive to Romani people. "

"Clapham Wood is near where I live a still freaks locals out. It's a bit north of the fairly large town of Worthing and east of the small village of Clapham. It's not actually a particularly large wood but has more than it's fair share of weird shit.

There were a load of UFO sightings reported in the 60's which bought a fair few paranormal hunting tourists to the area. Then there are the four unsolved disappearances and murders throughout the 70's and 80's, where the bodies turned up some time after the event, victims include the local reverent and police constable. There are also multiple accounts of animals freaking out and bolting away from the woods, mostly horses and dogs, some of which had to be put down for displaying rabies like symptoms (we don't have rabies in the UK). Weird satanic shit often turns up in the woods to this day, animal bones, blood stains, crosses, candles, odd knives etc. Plus people have found hidden shacks and tents in the undergrowth with more satanic stuff attached. There are rumours of graves being disturbed at the local church yard as well, which may explain why a reverend was one of the victims.

A big storm in 1987 felled a lot of the trees in the woods which put a stop to the murders, but the woods are recovering to their original size again now. There is an ancient quarry in the woods which apparently results in higher than normal levels of background radiation (not harmful though), it's been theorised animals might detect this. The geography also seems to result in a lot of localised fog which tends to hover just above head height and add to the ambience.

To get into even weirder religious things, Druids/Pagans/Satanists believe in 'ley lines', which cross the country between important sites. Apparently the woods forms some sort of triangle with two ancient hill forts nearby which gives it some significance. Druids and Pagans can occasionally be seen performing candlelit rituals on important dates at those hill forts, although they seem harmless enough.

So yeah, I don't believe in all this weird paranormal shit, but what I do know is that four unsolved murders happened in those woods and weird people hang out there, so I'm certainly not going there after dark. This is all happening in an otherwise fairly quiet part of Southern England as well."

There was one man in the room who reviled Stephen, but he was just jealous and secretly repressing his own homoerotic feelings towards our brilliant and verile protagonist."""

Adolf hitler starts WW2, Japan enters battle with America, Nukes, during the rebuilding of japan a man starts writing comics and giving them away for free to boost peoples moral and give them a little escape from everything.

"My edgy hot take - Christians see God the way they want Him to be (human, compassionate); Jews see God the way He is (brutal, arbitrary, jealous).

The theological/philosophical implications are staggering; that said, why should we assume God is less complex of character than the average human?"

My mother had a horrible boyfriend who threatened to kill us when my mom wanted to leave him. I am having debilitating axiety since I' m 13 because of him. Just when I thought it couldn' t get any worse, came my stepdad. Despite the fact that I was happy that I 'll finally have a dad and I was never mean to him whatsoever ( I always made him.gifts, tried to talk to him etc), he always treated me like shit. He always found something to mock me about and never acknowledged my accomplishments ( I' m 20, speak 4 languages , I had all As at High School , I won  many national competitions , I passed my language exam in English when I was 14 without learning it at school) but he never EVER said that he ' s porud of me. Instead, he complained that my exam cost a lot of money (it didn't), that I'll never get anywhere in life becauae my knowledge is useless, that I' m an idiotic piece of shit who knows nothing about real life (says the 30- year old man who 's been living with his mom his entire life), that I' m lazy, useless and a stupid whore. He never supported me nor emotionally nor financially.When I called him at midnight because of an emergency, he hung up the phone because he wanted to sleep. I was excluded from family vacations. We moved in with him in another town so I had to leave all my friends behind. At the new school, everyone bullied the shit out of me. So today here I am with extreme social anxiety , waves of depression, and a lots of other mental and physical problems to deal with. 

Edit: Thank you all for your kind comments, it really means a lot :)"
"While I agree with this, and I do and I'm not saying you implied anything else, but it still doesn't mean it's for everyone. I'm nearing late 20's and already get weird looks for not wanting a child ever. Go ahead and have a kid if that will fill your time, but I have too many hobbies and ambitions that require practice, and too much I want to see of the world to damper it even a little bit. Because it's my one life that is permanent. Everyone has a choice to not have a kid. Most people don't think it through and that's more unfair for a ""kind of"" wanted or completely unwanted child."

Joseph Gordon Levitt plays an alcoholic fisherman who lives on his boat. One night he stumbles out and drunkenly mumbles that he wished the Boat were a real boy.

A blue fairy, flying overhead, hears the wish, shrugs and makes it so. The boat sprouts arms, legs, and a mouth from its exhaust port. Its also majorly mentally impaired from growing a brain instantaneously.

The next hour of the film is JGL trying to take care of his boat son, before ultimately giving up and smothering it in its with a comedically oversized pillow.

"When I was younger I used to collect porcelain dolls. My mom was a huge fan and would often bring me some back from Mexico. The dolls would move out of the corner of my eye, sometimes appear in new places I hadn't placed them. Eventually I got rid of my entire collection out of fear. But this isn't about the dolls, around 10 years old my aunt used to drop her kid off at random hours of the night so she could party freely. I remember many nights waking up and seeing my young cousin crying standing next to my bed waiting for me to acknowledge her.

One night I woke up around 2 am and saw the outline of a small girl with long curly hair. I spoke out to her, thinking it was my cousin, I told her to come to bed. But she was unmoving. The outline stayed there, staring at me. Eventually I went back to sleep, still under the assumption it was my kid cousin acting up. 

The following morning I went into the kitchen searching for my cousin, I remember asking my mom where she was at and she told me my cousin never came by that night. 

Fast forward a couple years, more spooky shit continues going on in the house so my mother brings in a lady to bless the house. When the woman walked into my room I remember the look on her face. She stopped and looked around, whispering prayers. The woman stopped her whispers and asked my mom, ""have you had a daughter that's passed?"" Of course I'm the only living daughter so I tell the woman no it can't be possible. But my mom spoke about how before I was born she had miscarried another girl. The woman continued on describing my unborn sister. She had curly hair like me, she enjoyed playing with dolls and according to the woman she came often to visit me. "

Go to your local exotic fish store (mine is fish Doctors). They likely do custom tanks. They'll give you an itemized list, build the tank and sump (preferably refugeum), and install it in your home. You don't want to improperly install the necessary lights for reef tanks anyways. 

I used to do this in high school, and everyone loved teaching people how to care for tanks. I never met anyone in the industry that wasn't an enthusiast. So just ask questions and watch the install. You'll be going back to the shop a lot anyways, so it's easy to make real friends. 

Most good installers will give you incredibly detailed instructions on how to cycle your tank. When to add live rock and snails. The list goes on.

Good luck! It's gonna be pricey but it's awesome to have a piece of the ocean in your home. 

Edit: Additionally, the best, most sustainable tanks are custom. To do that, you're gonna have to drill glass. Easy for some, a nightmare for me and most others. "

"Your ""most likely explanation"" is almost certainly not correct, as the connection arose long before Columbus sailed the ocean blue (and even before the founding of the Roman Empire!) and in much of southern and western Europe winters are significantly *more* humid than summers, not less.

The connection probably arose because in ancient times the common people rarely if ever travelled except at harvest time, when they took their crops to market. That was virtually the only time they met with other travellers carrying viruses they hadn't yet been exposed to. They'd return home as unwitting carriers, spreading the new viruses around their home villages just as chilly, soggy winter set in.

Early medical theorists like Hippocrates explained this through the humoral theory of medicine, where exposure to certain external forces was thought to lead to an imbalance of the body's four humours. Exposure to cold was supposed to cause an excess of phlegm, so any condition that produced phlegm was called a ""cold""."

Even Q only had about two dozen appearances across three shows.

"This was in the 7th grade, I'm 34 now and I can still taste it. I was at a friends house, his mom made homemade mac and cheese. My favorite! And so simple, how can you fuck it up?

Answer, if you cook the noodles until they've lost all the firmness, like 15 minutes past al dente they turn into a mush. Then, my guess is she must have just dropped 3 or 4 slices of american cheese into the boiling water and let that be the cheese sauce.

So it was mushy noodles that were swimming in cheese water. I ate two bites out of politeness and almost threw up,  I just sat at the table looking pale after that, just staring at this disgusting soup with a look of horror.

"I was in this long-distance relationship with this guy.  This guy was a huge dick that could care less about me and mainly used me to get off on.  I was young and stupid and thought this guy was just the greatest ever. 

My parents found out about all the shady shit going on with me and him (i.e. me staying up crying all night because he would be out with some other woman) and decided to take my phone away from me       (my phone was the only way I could communicate with this guy)

Well, I stayed over at my grandma's house for a few nights and I memorized this guy's number. I would wait till everyone had gone to bed, go into the bathroom, and call this guy from my grandma's house phone.  I didn't care if I was racking up her phone bill and I would lie there on the bathroom floor crying all night about how much I missed him and how I would run away and live with him.

"Like a lot of organizations listed in this thread they all started with good intentions. Most of them were started because no other type of organization like them existed at the time.


The problem is that over time people come and go. The original founders pass on, move on, or retire. Then new leadership comes in with new ideas or infighting starts because people can't agree on direction. These organizations also achieve their goals and the only way to continue is to move onto other aspects. 


So the end result is an organization that is hijacked or headed in a new direction because it achieved its goals. The original founder of MADD left in 1985, 5 years after founding it because she didn't agree with the direction. In my opinion MADD is just a cover name for an organization that is the modern prohibition movement."

When the slide became disclosed, I saw the internal reaction.  It was complete and total ""wtf"" from a lot of engineers.  The problem (simplified) was that data sent between trusted servers was sometimes sent in the clear.

The response was an immediate and priority one push to encrypt all the things.  The NSA slide had a smily face about where the encryption was gone -- SSL added and removed here.  http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tech-companies-slap-back-at-the-n-s-a-s-smiley-face

The top comment on the company memeboard for a while was that slide with ""Not anymore, fuckers.""

While there's always a risk with trusting a third party with your data, Google's relationship with the NSA is not a cooperative one, at least as far as I could tell during my tenure there.  We had classes on how to politely not cooperate with law enforcement (though there were limits to what we could do in the face of a lawful search).  The general feeling around the NSA attack was ""we expect this shit from China, not from our own government.""

I have no doubt Google is very self-serving in this regard.  Their business model depends on you trusting them, given how much they know, but there's more money to be had working on the side of privacy than the side of government."

"Had a new entry last night.

I work part time as a grocery store over nights as a second job to help balance the budget and pay off some debt faster. 

It's a chain store in the midwest, one of the few stores in the city open 24/7 and while normally considered to be on the good side of town, attracts a number of characters late a night.

Generally, 2-3 times a night myself or one of the assistant managers will go out, gather up all the carts people leave laying around and bring them back into the store and shoo away any loiterers.

So last night as I'm taking the last of the carts in, probably around 2AM, I notice a man taking his cart back to his van with his kids. I had seen them in the store earlier, the kids were well behaved but he was acting suspicious, see one of his kids pull a can of soup out of their pocket and put it in one of the bags. 

Obviously stolen, but frankly don't care because the store won't do anything if its under $500. They paid for everything in the cart, I could give a damn over 79 cent can of noodles and ramen packs. If you're stealing food then calling the cops won't help.

Trying to be a nice guy as he's going wide eyed at me walking past and seeing his kids empty their pockets, I change the subject and offer to take his cart back to the store once he empties it so he wouldn't have to walk back across the parking lot to the store and get his kids home a little bit quicker. 

After realizing that I'm not going to report his children or try and confiscate the goods back, he happily pushes the cart at me **and then proceeds to beg money from me.** Saying its hard having kids and every little bit helps. When I told him I didn't have any cash on me, he started getting upset and pushing harder, saying his gov card only covers enough for 5 meals a week.

Was all I could really do to wish him a good night and take all the carts back to the store as I could hear him start to berate one of his kids for stealing the wrong kinds of soup. If I hadn't been so bewildered by him begging for cash in front of his kids I might have just called the cops on him.

TL;DR Man has kids steal food, then has the audacity to beg for money from an employee in the parking lot because it's hard being a parent.

Don't use your kids as an excuse. It's shameful. 

And don't beg for money in front of your kids while putting stolen goods into your 2 year old minivan.

"Not to pick on this comment particularly, but I've never really got this idea of dogs as being such amazing companions that it's like having an actual, human, (man's best) friend/relationship. That's not to say I don't like dogs. What's not to like? They're furry and friendly, and fun to be around. I've owned dogs, I've cared for them greatly and I've been hugely upset when they've left me. I'm a big animal lover generally.

But living with a pet isn't really in any way similar to living with a person - not that it's inherently better or worse. No doubt it can be lovely to be greeted by an excited, possibly adorable canine pal when you get home, but it's completely different to an actual human being, with a much more advanced brain, who's able to empathise, and sympathise, and, you know, have an actual two-way conversation with you. Just speaking personally, I would struggle without that, and I think a lot of people are similar. "

"If you want real advice, don't listen to that guy. There's a few fail safe ways to really build a good credit score with your credit card. 

1. Keep your utilization rate below 30% or so. Have a 1000 dollar limit? Don't spend more than 300 per month.

2. Only put things on it you would buy normally even without the card. Gas, groceries, that sort of thing. 

3. Pay it off in full every month. You'll avoid paying interest which is a road that if you start on, is often hard to recover from.

4. If you see something you want but don't need and don't have the funds in your actual bank account to cover it and still be comfortable afterwards, then don't buy it on credit. That's a rabbit hole. 

You follow those four steps, you'll build good credit with ease. Once you start to earn more money and build your net worth, the rules can change a bit. But just starting out, you won't fail with this. "

"My grandparents bought an old beautiful stone house about a decade ago, it sat on a hill over looking a lake and had this crawling ivy up alongside the front of the house. There was a long winding driveway through some woods to get to the house, and every time we would visit it would feel like the beginning of the horror movie where the family pulls up to the remote ghost mansion and you just know that shit is about to go down. 

So we're helping move everything in and my brother and I are messing around upstairs around this old bookcase built into the wall. I notice a small latch on the bookcase and I pull it down, opening the bookcase. At the time this was by far the coolest thing that had every happened to us, we found a secret room behind a bookcase. So we crawl through this little passageway and it leads to a tiny room that had a small cot, some clothes scattered around, and a couple of dishes. It seemed like someone was actively living in the house, there were cobwebs all over, but there was a sense that someone was living there. We run downstairs and tell our parents, who aren't in the mood to hear ghost stories from two kids so they ignore us and tell us that it was probably an old servants quarters. Well it turned out someone had been living in the house, they left while everyone was moving in and for some reason they tried to break back in that night. The house had been empty for a couple of years and this guy figured this out and was living in it. 

I never felt so justified in my life. "

I donated my hair to an organization that provides wigs for adult women with both cancer and alopecia. When you think about it, kids with cancer... their hair will grow back, people are understanding of baldness if you're sick, they spend most of their time at the hospital or home where being bald isn't embarrassing. Kids with alopecia have to live with the condition their whole lives, so durable high quality wigs really help.

"Are you serious right now? He was young and had no idea what to do, he was lied to, and he was being threatened by this woman when he tried to contact her. Just because he has never had any experience as a father and didn't know what to do, he shouldn't have the right to his own daughter? What's REALLY surprising is that no one stepped in sooner and told him if he really wants to have an entire lifetime with his biological daughter, he should immediately start the court process. Do you really think the woman who is going to lie to a CHILD, and tell them that their real father is a pedophile, and try and ruin his life is REALLY the best person that child should be with? What does that say about that woman? She sounds like a monster, and if she would say that about her daughter's own father what other kinds of things does she say/do to this child? And he DID mature and try to step up, he said he moved in with her, tried to make it, work, when it didn't he said he went to all the doctor's appointments, the ultrasounds, he kept trying to get in contact with her. He did everything right and she ripped his own child away from him. You have no right to judge him and tell him he's selfish for wanting to see his own child, you disgust me. And OC, as someone who has never met their own father, I have hated him my entire life for not giving enough a shit about me to try and find me, or to talk to me, or right me letters, or try to be involved in his life. He didn't want to have to go through court because he had some arrest warrants for him out, and it would legally have to be supervised visits because he had been arresting for domestic violence. But I promise you no matter what, whenever your daughter finds out the other man is not her father, her mother is going to fill her head with lies about why you aren't there, and she's going to claim she lied about her step dad because he loved you when you wouldn't have. There is someone else out there raising your baby, and you have no idea if they are okay. Like I said, as someone who doesn't have a dad, I think your daughter will only see that you didn't love her enough to fight for her. And you've done nothing wrong OC, I don't think you have any short commings in this situation. You actually tried, and I think you should keep trying if you know in your heart having your daughter means something to you. From everything I've read it sounds like you love this child you've never even had the chance to raise. "

Almost all civilian death resulted oddly from the overreaction and panic to quickly evacuate (mainly death due to stress of old people) when actually the zone was over the norm but actually out of the danger zone

"You know, I work in a locked psychiatric unit so you may imagine that I've seen the worst of the worst relating to BPDs. However, I get to work an 8 hour shift and go home; it's people like yourself that I truly feel for. People who have to deal with these individuals day in and day out and be made to feel like you're the problem. People who get chewed up and spit out when there's nothing left to give. Who act as emotional punching bags and probably have no clue (at least initially) that there is something clinically wrong with your partner. 

Im glad to know that you got out. Borderlines are victims too, undoubtedly, but again, that doesn't mean you have to hitch your wagon to that pony. 

I hope the absolute best for you in the future. "

2. I smacked her back. This is the only time I've hit a woman and I still feel guilty over it 20 years later.

"I wish the term aspergers was still in use, or some equivalent. Blanketing all forms of autism under the same phrase with the only difference being high functioning and low functioning is severely misleading.

I have autism. I'm also a fully functioning adult capable of living on their own. Unless I disclose my disability to people, they don't know I have it. But I'm still lumped into the same category as the people with autism I used to take care of whose mental and emotional capabilities are stuck at that of a ten year old. Because they can do simple tasks for themselves and don't need constant supervision, they're considered high functioning as well.

I don't feel like it's something I can disclose in a relationship unless I've been in it for months. I don't feel like I can talk about it with an employer because the one and only time I did they put me on the easiest case they could and I later found out got money from the state for hiring me just because I'm ""disabled."" 

I talk about it online because there's nothing to lose on the internet. People treat you the same as they treat everyone else online. In real life if you tell someone you have autism, they treat you like a child. Everything even mildly childish you do is related to being autistic, even if normal adults do the same things. 

And you know the worst part is that I feel like I can't emote properly even when I want to. No extreme reactions to anything. Make sure to smile at the right times. Remember to pay attention to everything I say so I don't accidentally say something offensive. Pay close attention so you know when to end a conversation so you don't annoy people. Crying because you got a little stressed out isn't allowed. Act normal.

But I'm not normal and I never will be."

"&gt; Further evidence of this is the large portion of the Pearl Harbor fleet being out for training that day. Especially all the aircraft carriers.

How many ways can this be wrong?

Nine out of the nine Pacific Fleet battleships were in Pearl Harbor at the time of the attack.  Two of the eight heavy cruisers and six of the nine light cruisers were in Pearl as well.  30 of the 50 Pacific Fleet destroyers were in harbor.

The remainder of the fleet was with the carriers *Enterprise*, *Lexington*, and *Saratoga*.  *Saratoga* was just about to leave San Diego after a major refit and overhaul.  *Lexington* was about halfway between Pearl and Midway, on a ferry mission carrying a squadron of Marine dive bombers.

But what of *Enterprise*?  She was about 200 miles west of Pearl at the time of the attack.  She was on her way back from delivering a Marine squadron of Wildcat fighters to Wake Island... and this is where the whole conspiracy theory kinda falls apart, because *Enterprise* was scheduled to have returned on December 6th.  Heavy weather forced the Task Force to slow down (the destroyers couldn't take the battering) and thus barely miss out on being the center of attention that morning.

So using the fleet ""being out for training"" story as evidence of a conspiracy is pretty much a crock of turtle manure."

""I need to fill up out there, fuck you think..."" he just points at the window and makes no attempts to be specific.

""I just need to fuckin fill it, god damn it, and its the white truck out there, fuckin bullshit town...""

'We could start the number a little high, whatever you dont use it put right back on the card when you hang it up, and which white truck is it?'

""its right fucking there are you retarded? fine put 80 on there""

At this point through elimination i have figured it out which truck and proceed to get him out the way....

'Absolutely sir, you have yourself a fine day now'

At this point I attempt to wash myself of this man, but jackass has other plans, he pushes past my other customers physically almost slams into my door, angrily sets up the pump, then proceeds to think hes gonna smoke a fucking cigarette at the pump. Immediately hit the hard stop, go to the intercom, look straight out at him and begin shakin my head waving my finger going 'ah, ah ah' just like the fats guys virus from Jurassic Park.

He was fuming, outraged, insulted, and he came back to try and tell me to so, my boss is there, and she has witnessed the entire thing, tells me to go in back.

""What the fuck is your guys problem, little piece of shit needs to come out here ill kick his fucking ass""

Manager immediately gets on him ""' Did you just threaten my employee?!What gives you the nerve?DO i need to call the cops?Get the fuck out of my store, i saw everything, your rude, incosiderate and worst of all you almost blew up my fucking store, get the fuck out now or ill let him come out here you scrawny sack of shit!""

"Exactly. A huge part of growing up is learning boundaries, learning when your wants go too far. Others signal that you are crossing their boundaries by pushing back on you -- saying no, ridiculing you, punishing you, etc. But if you can override all of them, then you can do anything you want, any time, with no boundaries.

Some time later, people go down into the Catacombs and find a hunchbacked skeleton cradling a broken-necked skeleton.

And nary a singing gargoyle is seen.

Edit: Actually, I goofed. Phoebus doesn't die. Instead, he goes on to marry happily (as he'd only been trying to get into Esmeralda's skirt), and lets her die because he doesn't want to endanger his position and marriage. Dude's a total piece of shit.

It was my job to hold the animal for the injection.

As the vet pushed the plunger in the dog would just relax, all tension just gone. And that was it. No pain. No sounds. 

I wondered, are they just paralyzed? I asked the vet one day if that was so. He told me that he knew a fellow vet who tried to commit suicide with euthanasia medication, and that they had failed because it had put them to sleep before they could finish self-injecting.

"“The truth about the world, he said, is that anything is possible. Had you not seen it all from birth and thereby bled it of its strangeness it would appear to you for what it is, a hat trick in a medicine show, a fevered dream, a trance bepopulate with chimeras having neither analogue nor precedent, an itinerant carnival, a migratory tentshow whose ultimate destination after many a pitch in many a mudded field is unspeakable and calamitous beyond reckoning. 

The universe is no narrow thing and the order within it is not constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists in one part in any other part. Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way. For existence has its own order and that no man's mind can compass, that mind itself being but a fact among others.” "

"One of my father's friends (Lou) was a moderately senior person at the USDA, and there's a story he would tell about the government cheese program. It had started because they'd decided there it was silly that they were spending tons of money to buy and store surplus cheese to raise prices while at the same time they were also spending tons of money making food affordable for poor people.

But once the program had gotten going, Lou had been given the task of meeting with Dairy Industry lobbyists who were furious that the program would flood the market and drive down prices. He managed to calm them down by telling them that this was a new market that wasn't currently eating much cheese, but once they got used to having the cheese, they'd get a taste for it and would keep eating cheese even once they got off the program. Lou told me he was just making this up to get the lobbyists off his back, but years later it turned out that he'd accidentally told the truth."

"That the ""MI5/Prince Phillip killed Diana"" conspiracy theory was invented by the press to cover up their actual involvement in her death. Mohamed Al-Fayed latched onto the conspiracy theory because we was a grief stricken father looking for answers.

The truth was, if the paparazzi weren't chasing Diana, they wouldn't have crashed. The driver wasn't drunk enough to be speeding for no reason. Even if he was, the fact two paparazzi photographers obstructed emergency services, stopping them from getting to Diana in time to save her life played a massive part in her death.

The major British Tabloids have a lot of power in the UK, so they made up the Diana conspiracy to protect their profits, knowing if they *did* get blamed for the accident that the public backlash would end a lot of careers."

"The Japanese were absolutely brutal. The Nazis (rightfully) get a lot of coverage for their horrific actions, but the Japanese seem to get a pass (at least in the United States). The Japanese may not have committed widespread genocide but their horrific war crimes deserve better historical attention. A well known and excellent read on just in such event is *The Rape of Nanking*. Japanese soldiers ripped fetus from helpless women with their bayonets. Used the Chinese citizens as target practice and so much more.

The Japanese also treated their POWs terribly. The Battan Death March is just one well known example. I might be a little off on my numbers (undergrad was almost 20 years ago) but in a Japanese POW camp 1 in 3 soldiers died. In contrast, in the Nazi POW camps the death rate was about 1 in 33.

The Japanese deserve all of the derision and scorn that the west heaps on the Nazis, but because Japan made an advantageous staging ground to spy on the Soviets (and other military and political reasons) much of what the Japanese did was swept under the rug by the U.S."

At meeting him I told him about PLUR - Peace, Love, Unity &amp; Respect and why it's important for the USA &amp; the world. I then put one of my candy bracelets on his wrist. I remember that it just happened to blue and white stars. He then smiled, looked a bit confused, and gave me a big hug. He had a look on his face and seemed confused by the meaning of PLUR.

The next day he was on the front page of the local paper sporting his new candy. I was so proud ;)"

Plus I've dodged plenty a bullets with my lack of just saying ""I like you"" that's for goddamn sure.

I don't know why they always end up opening up to me, but if I tell them I like them before that happens I ruin the chance of us actually becoming friends in attempts to just see their reaction when I let it out.

"Having the information memorized, or having the degree and the information at intuitive hand, but not knowing how to use it like a tool and not a belief system. 

People seem to think, once they learn something, they 'know it'; yet we know we also forget. 

People think, once they learn something, they understand the topic; when really, they understand the basics of a topic and only general applications of the knowledge.

Then, when people become very educated into a field, they assume they understand the world from that field.

In all regards, the person who is smart understands the limits of knowledge and information as it relates to the conditions that matter and give it value; the person who is educated and smart is like a Swiss-army knife.  not to say a mind can dull with time, or be used improperly form time-to-time.

There is still something to be said about 'wisdom'. This is something a smart person might not have by years of experience, but an under-educated person of average intelligence via metric will possess from many years lived: even an old tiger learns where the diminishing returns on effort exist in the hunt, and the virtue of basking in the sun."

The funeral was open casket and the line for the final viewing seemed to be moving all too fast. I wasn't ready for this, and sooner than I had liked, it was my turn. As I walked forward, scared and unsure what to expect, my grandpa walked up, cutting in front of me. For a split second I was glad he had done it, I wasn't ready yet, but then I wished he hadn't. 

I had never seen grief in such a pure form before then. The ungodly sound that escaped his mouth, the buckling of his knees causing him to collapse on top of the casket, the uncontrollable shaking due to his wretched sobs... I'll never forget that. 

It wasn't until I was older that I could appreciate what losing a child does to a mother; my view before was clouded by my grandpa's grief. My aunt is a strong woman and never really showed us kids her grief, though I know now just how much it affected her. 

People always talk about the grief of a mother losing a child but no one ever talks about the grandparents, who not only lose a grandchild, but also lose apart of their child and the helpless feeling they get knowing that there is nothing they can do to help the emotional pain that stays with them for the rest of their lives. It's a hopeless feeling that never really goes away. It's a different kind of grief that I hope I never have to witness again. "

"Fantastic Beasts was *awful*. I know i'm not the OP but I'll give you a list of just some of the things I found terrible about it. 

-It felt like 2 (sometimes even 3) stories stuffed into one film. For the most part all of them were pretty disconnected from one another. 

-There was no alternate magic NYC. London had Diagon Alley/Knockturn Alley, and then a whole parallel magical world. There was just...one world in the US. This was even more confusing because the US wizards seemed to want to avoid ""nomaj's"" WAY more than English ones. You'd think they would make their own parallel universe and never leave. 

-I feel like the entire ""obscuris"" concept to be...weird. There is the issue of, well, why wasn't Harry Potter one? (and yes I've seen videos saying why but still). Additionally, if this *was* a big deal in the wizarding world, why wasn't there some sort of Wizarding Children's Society going around the world finding children like this to rescue them, and foster/adopt them out to Wizarding families who can raise them and teach them how to use magic. Even if not out of the goodness of their hearts, you'd think they would want to do this in order to protect the secrecy of their world and people. 

-The magic seemed to have no limits. I thought at first that Newt's suitcase would be like a sort of kennel inside. He had a freaking UNIVERSE inside it! He practically had an entire country inside it!It was ridiculous. Then that last scene where EVERYONE in NYC saw the obscuris and all sorts of Wizarding things! Really?! If they can just create freaking magical rain and erase everyone's memories why was Snape acting like Harry and Ron would bring about the apocalypse if 7 muggles saw the flying car? And how the hell was it that their magic repaired the *entire fucking city* with one wave of a wand? The magic appeared to have no boundaries in the movie. And when magic is too powerful in a movie like this...it's no fun. 

-Johnny Depp as Grindewald was *cringe worthy*. Really, at this point it didn't feel like ""new character of the Wizarding World Hiter-type villain"". It felt like ""Johnny Depp playing dress up/make believe."" 

-From a cinematic standpoint I thought that the camera moved entirely too fast in many scenes. It literally hurt my eyes and made me have to close or rub them several times in the theatre, like when we're seeing their congress or whatever they called it. "

"I think its less about thanking god and more about reaffirmation.

A lot of religion is repetition and ritual.  If you stop and distance yourself from it, it becomes ridiculous very quickly, so to maintain the faith religion (over time) has evolved to rely heavily on ritual and repetition to keep the faithful's mind focused.  

A lot of aspects of religion, all religions, only really exist to keep things familiar and create traditions that become hard to divert from.  For example, you might stop going to church but by god you still show up for Easter and Christmas service.  

The old school Catholics have gotten it down to an art with how guilt is instilled for breaking from ritual or tradition."

"That I didn't walk at my high school graduation. I had a penchant for cutting class, but I made up everything necessary. I was bored and became an underachiever but still even with not showing up I maintained pretty decent grades. Anyway, this pissed off one teacher, that I blew off her class and did makeup for it and was passing with a C. She changed the grade book, when it all blew up and we had a meeting about it she had to show the grade book, where it was obvious she'd erased my scores from makeup work and failed me. I found out 2 days before graduation that I wasn't being allowed to walk because of her. Even my assistant principal went to bat for me. But the head principal didn't like me, which is a whole other story, so he sided with the teacher. I was made to go to one week of summer school and the teacher who taught it told me he thought it was bullshit too and just spite. I was handed my diploma on the last day of summer school and the teacher said he was sorry that the other teacher screwed me over. What's worse is.. I'm a twin... so my family went to graduation and saw my sister walk, and all of my friends.. but I couldn't go and watch my whole class walk and not be up there. I spent that night at my then boyfriend's house crying and I was just feeling better when his bitch mom came home from graduation (she went to see a family friend graduate, who disliked me) and rubbed it in my face that I didn't get to walk. Idk, maybe someday I won't care, but I'm 36 and it still kind of stings 18 years later. "

Giving them free control over their actions isn't the logical thing to do, because while they might say they'll do the right thing, power is a very corrupting force.

"&gt; Snape is my favourite character in Harry Potter but I don't think we were meant to look at him as 'good.'

""Albus Severus Potter, you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew."" 

I realize that speaking to somebody that self proclaims Snape as their favorite character isn't going to change your mind, yet I do have to speak on one of my main criticisms of the Snape character. It also plays into one of my main complaints of Rowling's writing style. 

Snape is a massive character example of us being **told** that a character is great, that a character is brave, and that a character is the best ever. Yet, when we are **shown** the examples of the character as such it is much, much more complicated than that. Which is great, that is what makes a complex story. However, then Rowling will end around this complexity and pull the rug out from under it by just outright stating ""No, Snape was brave and Harry secretly loved him despite his complexity so much he named his kid after him.""

An example of Rowling pulling the rug out from under building complex characters is that Snape is given a massive redemption arc to show how complex of a character he is, *at the expense of* other characters that had germane redemption arcs as well. The two main examples being Sirius Black, and James Potter. James Potter is introduced to Harry as a great man without faults, who died to save him. We then find out that James Potter had a ton of faults, and was in fact kind of a twat as a teenager. Yet you can gather from background details that James completely did a 180 as a person - but we don't get that explored at all as we are only given *Snape's* perspective of James as a terrible person that stole the love of his life/best friend from him.

Sirius is another character where Rowling paints him as a complex person, but sacrifices him as the rowdy teenager that never grew up and was killed by his 'treatment of those lesser than him.' Sirius is very much a wooden, 2D character who is just as complex as the Snape character - but Snape was obviously Rowling's favorite. Sirius is the character who rebelled against his dark family so much that he moved into James Potter's house and was for all intents and purposes disowned for such behavior during a time such rebellion could have easily gotten him killed by terrorists. As many flaws as Sirius had as a person (this is why he, and Snape are mirror images to a certain extent), he still had an innate sense of wrongness about what his family was pushing him towards. Snape on the other hand, never really developed that - he was more guided because of his obsession with Lily Potter.

Yet, Rowling at many times has dismissed the Sirius character as not learning from the life he had growing up - while at the same time presenting the story that Snape is such a complex character because of his background. Both committed horrible sins, yet Snape is the only one presented with the redemption arc, and we are **told** that Snape is the better character."

So, I met Anne (fake name) my second year in college. I had just transferred, was definitely out of my element culturally, and was looking to get into dating. We met on a dating website, and when we finally got together it was pretty much love at first sight. We clicked instantly; we liked the same shows and movies, had a similar sense of humor, and just got along really well. I went from meeting her to hanging out with her on a daily basis, and for the semester pretty much stayed over at her place every night. Those first few months were amazing, from the TV marathons to the sex to the breakfasts, and I was dumbstruck.

There were warning signs. Anne didn't have many friends; none of the friends she had made the year prior at school spoke with her anymore, and even people she was allegedly very close with were barely ever around. Anne was very jealous of my friends who were women, even ones that I had known for many many years and had absolutely zero interest in dating. She was adamant about spending time with me, and I was more than happy to oblige. She bragged to me that she, ""never, ever broke up with anyone,"" even ex-boyfriends who she described as abusive and violent to her. Then, the anger started to come out. I don't remember what was the fist time that she lost her temper around me, but I remember being terrified. Anyone who has been in relationships like this can tell you that there is a difference between the kind of anger that is common and normal for people to have, and the kind of unmitigated, visceral fury that can be unleashed in virtually any conceivable circumstance. The latter is the kind of anger that makes your hair stand on end, that makes the animal in you start thinking whether to run or stay, where you become scared for your safety. It is unpredictable, like a summer storm that develops over your home and then blows away after ten minutes of hail and wind, leaving a clear blue sky in its wake. 

Needless to say, I ended up being with her for almost four years. 

I tried breaking up with her a few times, and the first time I did was when I knew there was something deeply wrong. I went to her apartment afterwards to console her (consoling her on my attempt to break up with her) and found that she had trashed her apartment in rage. I eventually relented. This happened a few more times. One time, the longest, I started seeing another woman at our school. Anne stalked her across campus, sent her threatening letters, and then blackmailed me into getting back together with her after getting me drunk and fucking me. This was when the worst of it really began. Our fights became regular occurrences, and in fact would become productions that would end up sucking in all of our friends too. There were a few times, usually when I tried to break up with her, that she would end up checking herself into a psych ward. One time, while I was home for the summer on a ""break"" of ours, I woke up to five voice mails, all at the maximum length, that she left for me from the hospital's day room. She would show me fresh cuts from self-injury, sometimes going the extra step to directly blame me for them, rather than letting insinuation speak for itself. Sometimes, when we would fight, she would just vanish, usually after leaving me a voicemail saying vague things like, ""make sure my parents take care of my cat when I'm gone."" There were a few times, when we would get into fights outside, she would try and jump into a busy street in the middle of the argument. I would need to physically restrain her, which would then provoke her to yell and holler about how I was abusing her. I never feared for my life, exactly, but in retrospect I wonder if there were times where Anne was close to snapping and assaulting me.

So, as far as fights go, here is an example. She would go back home on weekends often to work and help out with her (elderly) parents. One time, I got together with some friends of ours, with the assumption that when she got back into town she would meet up with us. Anne tried to slit her wrists, because according to her, we ""snuck around"" her and I was trying to dump her. She threatened to leave me if I took her to the hospital, I instead drove her to Wal-Mart so she could bandage/stitch herself up. I then dropped her off at her apartment, met back up with our friends, and I cried for about three hours. This was probably the most serious of the things that had happened, but there are so many incidents that I can't even begin to list.

I developed a drinking problem to cope, but of course, this made things worse, because now when we fought, I more quickly than not went to anger, and she used the fact that I was drinking heavily as an excuse for her behavior. I threw myself into schoolwork, and real work on campus, to get away, but she would always end up finding me where I was studying, or getting a job in the same office as me. Most everybody loved her, thought she was funny and endearing in a weird, quirky way. Sometimes, on break from school, she would show up at my parent's home to visit me, unannounced, eight hours away. Some of my friends saw what was going on, but no matter how many times they brought it up, I had given up leaving. 

See, I eventually came to blame myself for everything. I was abusive, I was erratic, impulsive, mired in depression and anxiety and alcoholism and Anne was simply going crazy trying to deal with my bullshit. Her explosions of rage were always, according to her, because I was inconsiderate, demanding, and heartless. One time, I was raped while at a party (another story altogether) and while in shock still I told her and she accused me of cheating on her, and did the whole pattern of self-harm and drama for about a month. I always regarded it as me being a cheating asshole until, years later, I told someone about it and they told me that in no uncertain terms I was raped. 

I did eventually leave her. We were approaching graduation - she found a job in the area and was planning on doing grad school nearby. I, not being from around there, was not sure what I was going to do. She started hinting very, very strongly that she wanted me to propose to her. I mentioned this to my best friends, two guys whom I had known since middle school and were at different colleges, while we were on spring break. I'll never forget the looks on their faces, they were horrified. They told me not to do it, and to leave her, and basically gave me a rundown of everything that had observed between us: the days she'd drop contact while we were back home following a fight and her vague plans to ""drive around the country for a while,"" the explosions of rage they had seen at times, the way that I had no agency of my own, basically. When I got back to school, I brought this up with some friends there, who all agreed. 

How I left her was, I moved across the country to stay with some distant family for a little bit, didn't tell her where, and broke up with her. I got phonecalls for weeks, her social media exploded, I had people (mutual friends who, somehow, never picked up on what was going on) asking what was going on, I just did what I could to move on from it.

Now, I am married to someone who is wonderful and fabulous, but I still deal with the trauma. My wife sometimes gets angry, the kind of normal anger I had mentioned earlier, about things and it will put me into a total panic response. Sometimes I fall back into decade-plus old patterns - appeasement, shutting down, and so on - that are inappropriate but kept me safe for a few years, and it's hard to break out of it. What's the most painful thing for me is the toll it takes on my wife. There are times when, while in the midst of having a normal married-people argument, I will dial up the level of the argument several degrees beyond reason because there is still some part of me, deep down, that hasn't gotten the message that I'm in a relationship where I am safe. I am mostly okay now. "

When I was in highschool the entire time we had one driver's ed instructor and im pretty sure she'd been there for years before. But this new instructor wanted less money than the normal one did so they hired her instead. One of the first in-car's she did (thats when you drive and the tells you where to go) she grabbed the steering wheel because she thought the kid was going to hit someone and ended up getting them into an accident. She was gone and the regular drivers ed teacher was back within a week.

"About 7 years ago, my mom and I took a road trip from Portland, OR down to Stockton, CA to visit a university I had been accepted to. On the way down we stopped at The Olive Pit somewhere in Northern CA, I'm spacing the name of the town because it's a little tourist spot right off I-5 and my Dad loves their specialty olives. 

This is where shit gets cray. 

We had dressed nicely because we were on our way to staying with old family friends (who I had never met) and it was a warm summer day. I remember I was wearing a jean mini-skirt. 
We were perusing the aisles of the store when a man passed my mom within close proximity. I was a few paces behind her, and instinctively for no legitimate reasons my thoughts as I watched his pass by her became aggressive and protective of my mother; i.e. ""you better fucking watch it"" Now the aisles were pretty small so afterward, I immediately tried to rationalize my weird thoughts. ""Haha, you're being silly he was just passing by her, nbd"" 

But as we continued wandering around the store, he lingered on the outskirts of wherever we were. My mom and I got nervous, but were hungry so we decided to grab a bite in the stores cafe before heading out. Mind you this weird man follows us to the cafe and stands in the back, watching us. We placed our orders then went to fill our drinks. That's when we were approached by a woman. ""Excuse me, but EVERYONE IN THE CAFE has noticed this man following you. My husband and I are looking after you, we're willing to call police"" 
We told her we had noticed and thanked her. While we ate this creepy man sat at the table next to us, just staring at us. Never saying a word. This woman's S/O offered to walk us to our car. He started following us out, to our car. So we went back inside, while creepy guy proceeded to get in his car and wait. A few mins later we slinked quickly back out to the car, and I drove out the entrance while he waited by the exit.

My mom and I were really shaken up over the whole incident. I still get freaked out thinking about what could have happened. But that was definitely an instance that stood out to me where my gut instinctively knew something was off and that I wasn't safe before I did."

She broadened my narrow view of human sexuality by forcing me to interact with her many gay friends. Drag queens, flaming queens, alcoholic queens, you name it, she had a friend like that. I grew to love these friends as family, making life long attachments. Sadly she is my ex now. Few couples survive the loss of a child, but I will always be grateful to her for showing me how to accept every shade and flavor of humanity. Still talk like I'm about to go fuck my sister. Lol.

"Not... really, no. Modern Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) are 'basically the same' because they stem from the same root religion (an older form of Judaism). Comparing them to other modern religions like Hinduism with a pantheon of gods and the underlying principal of dharma, or to Confucianism which doesn't really *have* any god or gods, and they're quite different.

And that's not even comparing to extinct religions, like the Ancient Greek pantheon or the Aztec pantheon.

I suppose if you went to a 20,000 foot view and said ""They all offer lessons on how to live"" that might be correct, but at 20,000 feet and generalizing a car and an Abrams tank are the same."

"My mom was a Christian Scientist and refused all vaccines (1950s). The only ones we got were the ones required by countries we lived in (State Department family), like smallpox and yellow fever. 

Growing up I knew many kids on crutches who had polio. It was very normal. My mom's best friend had a sister with polio, even, but when the Salk vaccine came out in the 1960s, I lined up with the other kids to get the vaccine but handed the nurse a note from my mom saying I shouldn't get it. That was just nuts to me. I realize I was protected by herd immunity, not prayer.

I never questioned vaccines when I raised my two kids, because there are some things that are givens, like protecting people I love."

"Religion is not this huge, rampant, wingnut ideology that is taking over the world that you seem to be making it out to be.

Most religious people are moderate, and don't engage in these bigoted, ostracizing practices. Religion is just as likely to support the unfortunate as it is to practice bigotry. Charity is a large part of modern organized religion (granted, corruption does exist, but mainly in large religious sects, and less of rural church communities).

These delusions of grandeur and supernatural forces are not something the average churchgoer dwells upon for an extended length of time. Most of the time belief in a deity is inherited as tradition. The anti-science and illogical themes pushed by religion are mostly the result of corruption in heavily organized religion, as evidenced by history (mainly the RCC).

Sure, religion can cause serious harm and all that, but it is not very likely to do that. In fact, historically, religion has increased literacy in society, and prompted scientific discourse, which is not a bad thing, of course, this all comes with bad elements also.

I agree wholeheartedly with your last sentence. Religion is not a reason to incite violence or practice xenophobia.

The best way to stem the tide of anti-scientific thought and critical thinking (which, in my opinion, has been largely talked up by heavy atheist forums for discussion) is with education. A rise of atheist beliefs in minors has been recorded, and I personally believe this is caused by the information age. Education can give the skill of critical thinking to most people, meaning that many religious people can look into their own beliefs and decide whether that belief is right to them.

What you're proposing is, in my opinion, no better than the 'gay conversion therapy' that is managed by the religious fanatics, even if your 'solution' has a more realistic goal. Religious people are not likely to drop their ingrained beliefs due to some officials telling them to. All this will do is throw more fuel to the already dwindling fire of religious fanaticism.

I read somewhere that new theories in science are not adopted by the scientific community, but that the opposition to such well-established theories die out. I think the nature of religious belief is comparable to this statement as well. For clarification, I am an atheist as well."

I've heard things about ABA having a bad history, but a lot of that is based on what they were up to in the 70's-90's, which anyone will admit wasn't great, sadly. They're having a lot more success with newer models like the Denver Early Start model, which is play based and was introduced in 2015. There's more understanding and acceptance of behaviors like stemming, but they emphasize learning to interact socially with other people/kids of all kinds, not changing who you are or how you think. So it's more about learning good social behavior to help people with autism operate in the working world and at school rather than stifling how they cope or think."

"Sir - you are completely wrong. 

There are many big wrecks caused by completely sober people. If a sober person can cause a huge wreck, so can a slightly intoxicated person, and even more likely for a hugely drunk person.

Think about it like this - the legislation is not against alcohol per se - what the legislation is really targeting is prohibiting drivers who are impaired by any kind of serious distractions. 

In the UK for example - drink driving (limit), drug driving, driving whilst using certain legit medicines, and driving whilst using a mobile phone are all banned, because they cause serious impairment or distractions - both reducing common sense and reaction times.

Whilst you may very well be correct that in the U.S. reducing the limit from .10% to 0.8% has had no noticeable affects on deaths related to drunk driving, I am willing to bet my bottom dollar that is has resulted in fewer crashes. 

MADD may be the organization you are blaming for the reduced limit, but it is almost certainly the insurance companies that pushed for this legislation too. Reductions in low speed crashes save them millions every year, on payouts for your car, the victims car/s and any medical claims (whiplash etc), which is surely even more exacerbated in the U.S which runs on a private rather  than national health system.

In all honestly, driving with any amount of alcohol or blood in your system should be illegal.  Medically speaking there is no 'safe' amount, and having limits is hard to police for individuals, after all its not about 0.10% is 2 standard drinks, the individuals metabolism matters much more - higher metabolisms process alcohol faster, getting more in the blood at a time, but getting rid of it faster.

Why is it not totally banned? Well really it is because of people like you and freedom gaslighters, a total ban will only be introduced once the majority of the population no longer considers it socially acceptable to drink at all and drive. 

This is what the UK is heading for with cigarettes - step by step. Banned it in restaurants, published health warnings, banned it in all bars and enclosed places, published health warnings, banned it in cars, published health warnings, banned them from being on display, published health warnings, enforced plain packaging, more health warnings. All the while ramping tax on them to extreme highs - guiding most people step by step. 

Banning something as commonplace as this, that was at the start socially acceptable, is basically a generational change, and it is all done in baby steps.

"Hi, recently diagnosed young adult with ASD here. My dad is also on the spectrum, so he found me easy to raise because he understood how I operated, expressed myself, and saw the world. We had this conversation recently how it could have been very different if I was born into a completely neurotypical family - how they would have noticed there was something different about me at a very young age, and if they had dealt with it with fear and a desire to make me ""normal"" I would never have grown into the person I am. There are a lot of autistic kids that can make it more work for parents - but the response should be ""I love my child regardless and they are not a burden. They might be difficult to raise sometimes, but I will find ways to deal with their behaviors and quirks and teach them to act in ways that do not hurt themselves and other people."" Many autistic people feel that Autism Speaks takes the opposite approach, appealing to neurotypical parents' fears that their child is different, encouraging an attitude that's more like ""My child is different so therefore there is something wrong with them. I have to make it so they are just like all the other children."""

"I feel like somewhere along the production line the movie was supposed to have the Joker as the main villain, in which case having Harley on the team would make sense.

"&gt;I used to take Remembrance Sunday very seriously when I was younger. Now I usually don't even bother with getting the poppy, because of how the tone of the event has changed.

Same and I know a lot of people who feel the same, young and old.

The message was 'never again'. The entire thing has been co-opted into an act of jingoism.

WWI centenary commemorations are case in point. The Tory government esp Gove argued ferociously to make it not sombre and introspective but a 'celebration'. Gove even argued that they went off to 'fight for freedom' and their sacrifice wasn't in vain, wasn't tragic... that's a major reversal. They didn't fight for freedom they fought for King and Country, and that was abused, and many including arch-jingoists like Kipling learned a painful lesson."

"Is it a team sport? Cause freshman year of college, I lived in a dorm with 8 floors. Once a week, we have this big seminar-type class that about 250 people in the building were required to attend (they took attendance and were really anal about everyone showing up every week). All of those 250 people lived on the top 3 floors, so after the seminar ended, there was always a huge rush to get back to the dorm first, so as to avoid the huge traffic jam/wait for the elevators. So my friends and I, being the assholes that we are, would sometimes decide to high-tail it back so we can be some of the first ones back. Not so we could take the elevator though, no, it was so we could sprint up the stairs and take turns running out to hit the elevator call button on each floor, forcing the elevator packed absolutely full of people headed to the top 3 floors, to stop on every single floor."

If you're not good enough to earn coins from jobs, you're not good enough to utilise the Continental services.

"I was involved and largely held responsible for a car accident where two people were killed; one was my girlfriend that was in my passenger seat, the other was a teenager in the passenger seat of a car that made a left turn (crossing my direction of traffic) in front of me, which led to me T-Boning them.

The days that followed were the hardest of my life, the passenger in the other car was pronounced dead within a couple hours, my girlfriend held on for three days until her parents took her off life support. Her organs went on to save/improve several people's lives. As a result, I lost my license for almost 4 years and had to do 160 hours of community service (which ultimately were the punishment for a speeding ticket, as that was all I was ever actually charged with). Emotionally, I don't think I've ever really recovered; I'm now married and have two kids, but I just haven't felt as strong as an emotional connection with anyone or anything since that accident. I've also not really talked about this much since it happened. I've sought out a therapist, I've talked to friends, I'm doing OK (this was over 10 years ago now), but the scar is still there, and likely will be forever.

Most of my friends stood behind me, but there was a lot of public hatred for me because I had a long record of tickets, and I drove a modified import, and that made for interesting news stories, I guess. They (the local newspaper) even dug up forum posts of mine including one where I called the Secretary of State some pretty nasty things for revoking my license. At the first hearing that I attempted to get my license back, he had a staff member attend (which is highly irregular) to ask the judge not to grant my driving privileges back.
I think I'm in a pretty good spot in life now, but it's safe to say that this forever changed my life (along with several others) and I'm still feeling the effects of it."

"And the Russian hacking story is a fabrication by the Urkaine company that worked for Hillary. They are the only source of the whole hacking story, and have not shared any information. The CIA and FBI reports are based on their story, nothing else. Somehow certain people in the agencies took the story to attack Russia. Probably because the CIA and Pentagon were meddling in the Ukraine and Syria and wanted to reduce the power of Russia. 

The hacking story only matches with the information that was on the Guccifer2 website. Not with the wikileaks files that showed the originals. Later another specialist showed that the guccifer2 files were copied from a USB, based on the creation-times, and could not have been obtained by hacking.  
The leaks were about Hillary's team hacking the election against Bernie. And for this certain DNC members were fired.  

I liked Bernie's standpoints and I think he made a better chance against Trump. :'(  

There were no hacks made by Russians that changed the election-results. That is because you need physical access to these machines. There were some reports of people sliding in a USB stick in the voting machines, and certain groups of people having trouble voting. The voting system is a big mess by itself. No outside influence needed. There has to be some improvement of the system.

If any country has meddled with the US election, I would say that it has been Saudi Arabia with their money, Israel with their influence and connections, Isis with their terror attacks, etc..  

And internally in the US, the two-party system, the corporate power, and the biased media has broken the openness and fairness that a good democracy needs. And I think this needs to be fixed. 

An organisation like [""Represent Us""](https://www.youtube.com/user/UnitedRepublicVideo) wants to stop corruption and bring back honest politics for all sides. A good start, but much more is necessary.

"I got to stay in this middle swank hotel while I was recovering the first three days after I got my boob job. The sheets, the drugs, the bed, everything and all the surroundings made me feel like a super princess.  When it was time to go home, I was still pretty fucked up and I started crying because the sheets we had in the house were actually my old sheets I took from home when I moved out like nearly 20 years ago. Old poly cotton blend things that were very practical if not kind of uncomfortable. I apparently bunched them up to my face and cried, very seriously, that this was going to be the end of the earth. I was going to slowly die if I could never stay in this hotel again. (Several states away from home)

  My husband, who is the most patient man I've ever met, sat down next to me and rubbed my back. I thought he was just letting me cry myself out. I was so silly and stupid and I knew it but the drugs made me feel like a little kid and I was in ""dropped ice cream meltdown"" mode.  He quietly pulled the sheets from my grasp, this very stoic look on his face. He gathered the top sheet up and stuck it in his suitcase. 

I freaked out, ""waitaminute, you can't do that, what if we get *arrested*?!""

  ""Small potatoes compared to what life will be like if I *don't.*""

I couldn't reply.  We never got a bill for the sheet, it's been a year and we still live in the same place so I imagine we would have gotten a bill on our credit card for it. I sleep with it every night. It's the softest sheet ever and when I wrap up in it, I feel fancy and rich just like I did when I was in that hotel room. I feel kind of bad but I'm super happy I have that sheet."

"Could the intended path of their voyage be guaranteed to encounter icebergs? What if they encountered none and arrived in New York fine? What then?

I'd also wonder about the crew. Clearly more than one of the crew had to be in on this plan, if it was indeed a plan. So they'd need to be ok with doing something that would not only be illegal, but also potentially fatal. No doubt significant reimbursement would be required, there'd also be the risk that word would get out and blow the whole thing open. Let's say the cancellations you mention are evidence of that, why did those people not speak up? Again, bribery dollars would add up.

Omg yes thank you for a recommendation that might be close to it!! 
"To say that the bombings (conducted primarily by British but also American aviators) were conducted simply ""just because"" is so disingenuous it borders on absolute falsehood.

&gt;Dresden was Germany's seventh-largest city and, according to the RAF at the time, the largest remaining unbombed built-up area. Taylor writes that an official 1942 guide to the city described it as ""one of the foremost industrial locations of the Reich"" and in 1944 the German Army High Command's Weapons Office listed 127 medium-to-large factories and workshops that were supplying the army with materiel. Nonetheless, according to some historians, the contribution of Dresden to the German war effort may not have been as significant as the planners thought.

&gt;The US Air Force Historical Division wrote a report in response to the international concern about the bombing - the report remained classified until December 1978. This said that there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers in the city supporting the German war effort at the time of the raid. According to the report, there were aircraft components factories; a poison gas factory (Chemische Fabrik Goye and Company); an anti-aircraft and field gun factory (Lehman); an optical goods factory (Zeiss Ikon AG); as well as factories producing electrical and X-ray apparatus (Koch &amp; Sterzel AG); gears and differentials (Saxoniswerke); and electric gauges (Gebrüder Bassler). It also said there were barracks, hutted camps, and a munitions storage depot.

&gt;The USAF report also states that two of Dresden's traffic routes were of military importance: north-south from Germany to Czechoslovakia, and east-west along the central European uplands. The city was at the junction of the Berlin-Prague-Vienna railway line, as well as the Munich-Breslau, and Hamburg-Leipzig lines. Colonel Harold E. Cook, a US POW held in the Friedrichstadt marshaling yard the night before the attacks, later said that ""I saw with my own eyes that Dresden was an armed camp: thousands of German troops, tanks and artillery and miles of freight cars loaded with supplies supporting and transporting German logistics towards the east to meet the Russians"".

&gt;An RAF memo issued to airmen on the night of the attack indicated that a secondary purpose of the raid was to ""show the Russians when they arrive [at Dresden] what [the British] Bomber Command can do."" The memo stated: 

&gt;Dresden, the seventh largest city in Germany and not much smaller than Manchester is also the largest unbombed builtup area the enemy has got. In the midst of winter with refugees pouring westward and troops to be rested, roofs are at a premium, not only to give shelter to workers, refugees, and troops alike, but to house the administrative services displaced from other areas. At one time well known for its china, Dresden has developed into an industrial city of first-class importance.... The intentions of the attack are to hit the enemy where he will feel it most, behind an already partially collapsed front

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#Military_and_industrial_profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#Military_and_industrial_profile)

Furthermore:

&gt;During the war, rumors circulated in Germany about the sanctity of the city due to its art and architecture; Dresdeners themselves did not seem to think that the city would draw the full wrath of the Anglo-American air forces.31 But there was a certain degree of self-delusion in this faith in immunity; it overlooked, for instance, the fact that much of Dresden's consumer-related industry had been converted to war-related industry. Dresden's biggest manufacturer, the lens and camera maker Zeiss-Ikon, made instruments vital to the war effort, including Luftwaffe bombsights. Seidel and Naumann, which had manufactured typewriters and sewing machines, switched in wartime to the manufacture of armaments. These are two examples among many others.32 And Dresden had not been spared up to that point: the Americans had waged two relatively light raids on targets in and around the city, in October 1944 and again in January 1945.

&gt;Some of the recent literature on the Dresden raid has highlighted the fact that Dresden contained a significant amount of war-related industry. This has been useful in countering false claims that Dresden contained little war manufacturing, or none at all. But the observation about war industry in the city must be used carefully because that industry was not the central reason why Bomber Command [End Page 424] attacked the city on 13-14 February, or the why the Americans attacked the city's marshaling yards on the 14th. Instead, Dresden's location was determining.

&gt;The city of Dresden is located due west of what was then called ""Breslau"" (Poland), seventy-one miles east-southeast of Leipzig, and 111 miles south of Berlin. The seventh largest city in Germany at the start of World War II, it sat in the middle of important east-west and north-south traffic routes, and was at the junction of three trunk routes of the Reich's railway system...

&gt;Anglo-American intelligence estimates reflected the air of crisis. In Britain, the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee (known as the ""JIC"") reported on 16 January 1945 that the ""probable worst case scenario"" is that the Russian winter offensive and Allied spring offensive in the West might achieve ""no decisive success"", thus forcing upon the Allies a renewal of the offensive in the West ""in about mid-August 1945"" coordinated with a major Russian summer offensive.36 In light of concerns about homefront war weariness—heightened in the United States by the burdens of a brutal war in the Far East—this was hardly a welcome prospect. On the same day, the Deputy Chief of Air Staff (Intelligence) proposed that the JIC prepare a report evaluating the potential impact of heavy air attacks on Berlin in conjunction with the Soviet offensive.

&gt;Several days later, on 21st January, the U.S. Strategic Air Forces Intelligence Office argued that Anglo-American armies had lost the initiative in the West, and that the Luftwaffe had been able to rebound ""to a degree not considered possible by Allied intelligence some eight months ago.""37 On that same day the JIC reported that the Germans might be able to send substantial reinforcements to the Eastern Front by February, and that these would grow through the month of March. They concluded that the progress of the Russian winter offensive would turn on ""the result of a race between the arrival of German reserves …and the loss of the Russian advance owing to logistic difficulties and the distraction of forces on the flanks.""38

&gt;On January 25th the JIC suggested an urgent review of the utilization of the strategic bomber forces, insisting that: ""The degree of success achieved by the present Russian offensive is likely to have a decisive effect on the length of the war."" Well-timed attacks against Berlin would assist the Russians, especially if these could be coordinated with the isolation of East Prussia and the fall of Breslau. Significantly, the report stated that: ""a heavy flow of refugees from Berlin in the depth of winter coinciding with the trekking westwards of a population fleeing from Eastern Germany would be bound to create great confusion, interfere with the orderly movement of troops to the front, and hamper the German military and administrative machine.""39

&gt;In a discussion of strategy held the same day the report appeared, Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command Sir Arthur Harris suggested to Deputy Chief of [End Page 426] Air Staff Sir Norman Bottomley that Leipzig, Chemnitz, and Dresden—in addition to Berlin—might be profitable targets for aiding the Russian advance.

"For years I have been cracking down on all the social agencies that help kids with disabilities and how they run. I've learned that the one that's closing down sucks and also caters to those with dementia and Alzheimer's. Also has terrible *terrible* staff who force you to do things that they want you to do and have no mercy for you.

But, I got into a new agency with 2 new Behavioral Health Professionals (who works with you on goals like money management, social skills, etc.), and I attend a social group once a week. Let me share with you some tools of the trade and how the group runs when we have it inside the office.

For one, there is a leader of the teen group (it's split by age group), Tina. If you're the most-normal person there, prepare to be in the spotlight. Especially if you have a defining trait, like a smile or a certain facial expression. This will cause Tina to focus all the attention on you before anything else. 

The group starts often with some exploration activity or a lesson on a particular skill. If you already know about making eye contact or taking the bus (which is a commonly talked-about subject because...most kids will not be able to drive? Okay, sure), this can be tedious. Often Tina tempts you with a snack--usually something healthy like fruits and veggies. (Sweets are for parties.) If there is a new person in Group, Tina helps everyone introduce themselves to them--and if you're ""the special one"", you may be called on to save the day and become that person's friend no matter what limitations they have.

After a while, you can eat the snack. Your BHP will often pressure you into eating a particular snack, but if you don't want it, wave them away and choose the snack *you* want. Because who's really in this group, you or them?

After snack time, the activity of the day! This is often games (which is a backup), but it can also be a learning activity or a craft, maybe even cooking. Crafts are fun; they're often taken from Pinterest or the Internet in general. Learning activities are a bit more dull. And cooking can be fun depending on what it is. You can sometimes catch the adults having a conversation that, by the Gods, is a *SIN* to discuss with a disabled child. (I've been victim to that a few times. Ehehe...)

Then, once 5:30 hits, clean-up. Sometimes kids start to do random things to clean up, or Tina comes around and does the ""draw a chore outta the hat"" method.

Then everyone leaves. See you next week.

Coming from my personal experience, it's pretty fun and exciting, especially if a new person comes around. But I usually guide newbies through the agency and how it runs--which I guess makes *me* the alpha of the kids I guess. Whoa.

EDIT: Forgot to add a few things. The times that we have the social group out of the office (which is in the warmer months), we usually go and walk on trails or go to a park or the beach. It's often followed up with ice cream. Yum.

We also have movie nights every month where everyone regardless of age can come and watch the picked movie. It's pretty enjoyable, but if there's a kid who scripts or makes a lot of noise in general it can get real annoying real fast, especially if subtitles aren't on. Sometimes we even go to the cinema where we get a discount for being a client of the agency. You have to split the money up though and it can get really confusing.

In addition we sometimes have big ""splurge"" events. A few months ago we had a girls' sleepover which was pretty fun, and the boys had a boys' night out. Sometime we're having an International Feast where kids can dine on various foods from around the world in an attempt to broaden our food spectrums. 

Okay, yep. That should be it."

1. Companionship is a hell of a drug, for both women and men. It's hard being alone. 

2. Usually the woman in this scenario is getting on in years and the dating pool gets substantially worse for women as they get older. 

3. Simple practical matters like domestic costs, time investment in building a life together, etc. Sure, the mom in this scenario *could* leave, but often times that would involve the very real consequences of yanking any sort of stable home out from under the children. So the mother in this situation will look at everything and think ""well, this guy's otherwise perfect provides for us freely, he's just a little bit molester-y. I think I can look past that if it means me and my kids don't have to live in a car.""

Oldest- (my ex). Married a guy who ended up molesting there daughter. He's in jail. She stole his sisters identity and ran up 30k of CC bills. Got probation. Lost custody of both her daughters. Rampant alchoholism. 

Middle- did porn. Caught herpes from forgetting to film when she had sex with people that paid her. 


Youngest- cam girl to feed heroin addiction. Her boyfriend/cam partner OD'd. She got charged. 



Mother- drank herself to death.

"An important thing to understand about Griffith is that he doesn't understand what kind of person he is. He thought he was driven by only his goal, as did you, but he cared deeply about the people who served him. This is evidenced by the scene where he stood over the mound of corpses on a battlefield and held a doll owned by a young boy who died fighting for him.  
Perhaps more clear evidence comes from the scene where he was trying to wash himself clean after he let a rich old man have his way with him. At first, he tells Casca that it was in pursuit of his dream, but when she brought up that they could have done without the lecherous Lord's money, and that it was only time that was saved, Griffith reveals his true motives. It wasn't the saved time or some risk of failure during that time that motivated him, he didn't want to lose the men who would inevitably die while he built up a fortune. He saw his self-sacrifice as a meager trade compared to the lives of so many. After that, he injured himself in an attempt to turn the pain he felt into physical pain, which he was adept at handling. Immediately, his demeanor changes as he suppresses his feelings and sends Casca away.  
Ultimately, the reason he transformed into Femto was that the God Hand convinced him that the sacrifices of so many men who died for his goal would have been in vain if he gave it up to protect the current Band of the Hawk.
The stairway corpses leading to Griffiths goal is more important to him than the goal itself. If he stops building, he'll have lost all those men, so many friends of his, for no reason."

"I agree with you for the most part she wasn't a good person. The only argument I have is that Ross was that bad thing that was constantly happening to her. Ross was a pretty good guy but it doesn't change the fact that she apparently still loved him which probably was the reason some of her relationships didn't work then watching him get married getting cheated on by him all while not being able to get distance because they're friends and raising a kid together. Then when she's taking huge steps in a career she's worked in for a long time he spills his guts once again and tells her not to leave so she has to sacrifice her career to give him another chance yet again which she does because she apparently loves him that much. 

Did not realise I had so much to say in rebuttal to something I mostly agree with but she had relationship issues everything else for her did seem easy and she mostly got her way. 

E: I realised my mistake after posting but yes they were on a break and he didn't cheat. She still felt like he cheated which isn't justified but it still would've sucked. "

As a very popular YouTuber in general,  it resulted in many other skeptic channels followed his lead, and they all went so deep down the rabbit hole that, rather than putting SJWs in their place, they turned into the horrific opposite side of the same coin. Now, ANY claim of racism, homophobia, sexism, etc., is instantly dismissed, resulting in massive amounts of those very things spreading like wildfire. It's resulted in countless amounts of bigotry and straight up awful human behavior getting a total pass because any resistance towards it is considered ""SJW cuck"" bullshit.

They send out software upgrades and your device performs slower.  Then another upgrade that it can't support.

"I don't know how good/bad extreme you are looking to go.  But the day care I was sending my kids to shut down for dubious reasons (they wanted to close and then reopen without having to worry about state inspections after getting dropped to a 3 star rating).  We barely got any notice and had to find a new day care in a hurry.  After a few tours we narrowed our choices down to two.  They both let our kids visit for a day.

* Day Care A: My daughter loved it.  Had a great time in the class with a wide variety of toys and art supplies.  Kids took her in right away.  My son? Cried and screamed in the corner all day.  They barely were able to even get him outside.
* Day Care B: My son loved it.  He just went from toys to foam blocks that he could jump in.  No screaming involved.  My daughter liked it, but clearly wasn't floored by what they had available unlike the other place.

We ended up going with Day Care B because it was cheaper and because it was more convenient for our morning commute.  It was a close choice and I don't have any regrets.  However, my kids still ask about the other place sometimes.  Day Care A also recently got upgraded to a 5 star facility (they have a banner outside announcing it).  

Like I said, I do wonder.  But it has worked out well."

Anyway, she wasn't in the best mood and also feeling sick. This  guy near us noticed how upset she was and told her she should smile more. She turned to him and said in a very sharp and clear voice, ""Would you like me to wear a little hat and dance for you too?""

"To be fair, a lot of Gypsies consciously choose to live life outside of the rule of law, and survive by illegal cash in hand work, and the odd burglary, or working in begging syndicates. Generally it's because they are forced into it by poverty, prejudice and growing up separated from society so they have little education and don't even know how to go about getting a job or a house. 

Nevertheless I think it's safe to say the lifestyle of many Gypsies constitutes a severe social problem and a blight on many rural communities which suffer from littering, crime and illegal cowboy builders that must be tackled. Just we need to tackle it by relieving poverty and discrimination and integrating them into normal society, not by the Nazi solution to every problem - removal from society."

Robb also thinks that. He chooses Roose to lead his troops against Tywin because that's the person he'd be most scared to have as an enemy himself. The fact that this gives Roose the opportunity to ally with Tywin is of course pretty difficult to predict.

I'm so glad I wasn't the only one! I actually started to *like* Kilgrave, at that point. And then it all went down the crapper, ad I remembered just why he was such a dangerous villain.

In that aspect, I think Jessica Jones may be the best of the Marvel Netflix shows. The others, even DD, tend to be rather black and white, but JJ is firmly planted in the morally grey, and revels in that fact. And so we get wonderful villains like Kilgrave, who make us question our own morality. "

"I'll help your friend out. 

Surface area of a sphere (we're assuming Saturn is a perfect sphere here) is 4pi(r)^2.

The radius of Saturn is about 58,232,503m, and I'll tack on one extra meter so the gas giant fits comfortably within its bag, making the bag's radius 58,232,504m. 

Plug that number into the surface area equation and we get an approximate surface area of 4.26•10^16 m^2. 

Okay, I used a variety of sources to find that a standard plastic bag is made of HDPE and has a thickness of 2.25 mils (sorry for different units, it'll all come back together in a moment). HDPE has a density of .95g/cm^3. After changing the units and doing some calculations, you can find that HDPE, at the thickness of a standard plastic shopping bag, has a mass of 54.29g/m^2. 

So now it's simply multiplication of the mass/area of the plastic and the area of the bag needed, and we'll have the mass of the sphere-shaped bag that can perfectly hold Saturn. 

*drumroll*

A sphere-shaped plastic bag large enough to fit Saturn would have a mass of 2.313•10^18g!

That's approximately the mass of 13,000,000,000 blue whales. Now that's a big piece of litter.

"Invictus - William Ernest Henly

Out of the night that covers me, 

      Black as the pit from pole to pole, 

I thank whatever gods may be 

      For my unconquerable soul. 


In the fell clutch of circumstance 

      I have not winced nor cried aloud. 

Under the bludgeonings of chance 

      My head is bloody, but unbowed. 


Beyond this place of wrath and tears 

      Looms but the Horror of the shade, 

And yet the menace of the years 

      Finds and shall find me unafraid. 


It matters not how strait the gate, 

      How charged with punishments the scroll, 

I am the master of my fate, 

      I am the captain of my soul.

This is just my experience though. Of course there are also a lot of not academically smart Asians out there. "

"Within the only 3 years I attended high school (I graduated early by taking summer classes), we had 3 different teachers get in trouble for having relationships with students. One involved a Band teacher in his late 20's who was gay and had relationships with male students in the band room, there was a large storage room in the room and janitors found a mattress. One was with the typical average Joe 42 year old coach/history teacher with a 16 year old female student, he was married with children. One was a 34 year old female chemistry teacher who was charged with over 10 different relationships with male students, she would have them over her house. Oddly enough I went on a date with this guy after graduation and he told me he was one those male students he then described in detail an intimate scenario that happened over at her house in her pool, and how she would call/text him all the time to get him to bring her food pretty much promising sexual favors to encourage him to give things to her or run errands.

I don't live in a big town at all, so it is just surprisingly how many of these things happened in a short time frame.

I wish my 7th grade history teacher who forced our class to play Howard Stern's Private Parts game had been fired too as he was a real bastard.

I can imagine space between planets, stars, galaxies, etc., even if the space I'm imagining is incorrect because I know that if you leave one to get to the other, the distance eventually closes. But how do you imagine the infinite? Trying to do it makes me feel sick.

I'm used to being able to imagine something ""more,"" but the infinity of space seems so finite to me. That probably makes shit sense."

"I feel like Survivor is one of the better shows, but it's not something I'd ever feel the need to watch religiously. The first couple seasons are interesting viewing simply because it was so groundbreaking for its time. Beyond that, there's some seasons I'd cherry pick(what comes to mind: pearl islands, the first one where they brought previous players back, the one where they fake-merged the tribes), but the show overall has gone on long enough that it's really not what it used to be.

Once in a while I go back and give an old season a re-watch, though, for nostalgia's sake."

"I will tell you one stupid dumbshit reason why they're wary of arresting female teachers: the story becomes international news.

In the average big city school system half a dozen male teachers will usually be arrested every year for molesting students but not even the local newspaper will give enough of a shit to report on it, and especially not if the victims are girls. It's too commonplace, too boring, too ""same old same old"" to sell newspapers.

A female teacher molests a boy? Page 1 worldwide with a screaming headline, baby, and you'd better believe the school, the entire school system, and the city will find itself dragged through the mud.

The worst part of it is that the victimized boys get dragged through the mud too. Nobody should know the names of underage molestation victims but the media doesn't give a shit about that if the victim is a boy. It's sexist and sickening."

"A few weeks ago my family went to a local burger joint for dinner. We tend to go less and less because the place really went down the drain with it's management, service and food quality. This past time was the last time.

We get in and the first thing we see is a waiter leave the kitchen whose floor is *filthy*. I'm talking trash everywhere, grease and oil all over the floor, just a mess. I already had a bad feeling but my folks were tired and just wanted to eat and go.

We order our food and when it arrives (we all got burger sliders) the waitress drops mine off and...there's massive hair sticking out of it. I'm not talking just one long hair (there was), I'm talking hair *plural*. ""Woah woah woah!"" I tell the waitress. I notice that every other table on this patio is staring at me know. ""What's *that?!*"" Waitress looks at it confused. ""Uhh...I dunno."" ""Ok, I'm *not* eating this, please put in another."" She takes it back. My parents remark they never got napkins or silverware. They didn't want to eat without a napkin in their laps.

The manager comes out and says ""I have good news! I looked at your food and it wasn't hair, it was some kind of fuzz ball from clothes or something!""

I look at her blankly and start laughing ""That's *not* making me feel better!"" She chuckles and asks if there's anything else she can do. I ask her for silverware and napkins for my parents. ""Well, I was going to give them that *anyway*, [bitch no you weren't you didn't even know till I asked you] I wanted to know if I could bring you a different meal?' ""? No just the replacement sliders I asked the waitress for already."" She was trying to avoid comping my meal.

""Uh, well before we put that in you want anything else?"" ""?! I told her to get a replacement, she didn't put the order in?!"" The manager smiles and shakes her head no. ""I've had enough. If my replacement isn't back by the time my parents finish eating take it off the bill and DONT BOTHER!"" The other tables are staring intently at us now. I don't give a fuck. My dad notices a giant charred piece of...we don't know what the fuck it was sticking out of his burger and asks the waitress what it was. Again she didn't know and took that for a replacement too. The table next to us started laughing at us and commenting we were just trying to get a free meal. I looked over and told them ""*YOU'RE* free to eat the hair and charred crap they gave us."" They shook their heads and stayed quiet. They comped our meal (we should have just left, I really wanted to) and we never went back.

**TLDR:** Found massive hairs in my food, manager tried to play it off as no big deal and didn't listen to instructions. Got stared at and laughed at by other tables. "
"This is due to what skin tone represents in each place.

She used to sleep in the laundry and if we'd put it on of a night time (it's a washing machine / dryer and the cycle goes for a good few hours), she figured out how to turn the whole thing off by the power button (which cancels the whole cycle too). We think she initially liked the funky beeping sounds it made when you switch it off. She's turned it on through the night time too and put it through a whole cycle and randomly turned it off so there would be water just sitting in there... "

As far as the sex on the show, you could say that every aspect of this show is absurd and that you should give it a pass for being unrealistic. Just in the first season, Frank moves in with Sheila while her clown-loving ex is living in the basement and he fucks his son's girlfriend in that same basement, which causes the Dad to commit suixide. Also takes dildos in the ass just for a place to live. It kinda sets the bar so that you just enjoy the ride vs thinking too much about realism. "

"Considering all the debates we have over the death penalty, though, most fantasy universes are surprisingly willing to condemn someone to a fate worse than that. At least in *Harry Potter*, murder, torture, and mind control are all considered illegal and unforgivable, but the punishment for each of those crimes is basically all three put together. And, at least to my knowledge, nobody finds this abhorrent or strange or even a little bit morally questionable. It just is what it is, and no one seems to even think twice about it. We know wizarding justice isn't perfect; after all, Sirius Black was innocent. Where are the anti-Azkaban protestors? I mean, they're fucking wizards, *someone* has to have thought of and tried to push for a punishment other than ""living damnation."""

"The 10th Doctor is not only an ass, but he is truly vindictive, selfish and self-righteous. Not only 'Time Lord Victorious', but also right at the very beginning of his tenure, Harriet Jones (former prime minister) blows up the Sycorax ship.
The Doctor doesn't like that. Fair enough. However, he knows that Jones will be reelected twice more, bringing in 'Britain's Golden Age' (Jackie: ""I'm thirty quid better off a week because of her!""). But she needs to be taught retroactive justice, apparently, and so The Doctor uses his 6 words of ""Don't you think she looks tired?"" To bring about a vote of no-confidence due to rumours of poor health, ultimately changing the good history he knew just because one stupid ape did something he did t like. And millions paid the price. 
He is also incredibly short-sighted. Due to his tampering with the political timeline, he directly allows 'Harold Saxon' to become PM, conquer the Earth with the Toclafane and kill 10% of all human beings. Leading to the Year of Terror (or whatever it was called) and put he collective future (rewritten past) of humanity into the hands of one little human who is also the most wanted person on earth.

**MCMANLY:** How's this for a response?

*McManly racks his shotgun.*

**FLUNKY:** That's five.

*McManly racks his shotgun.*

**MCMANLY:** *Six!*

*McManly pulls the trigger on his shotgun. It clicks on an empty chamber.*

**FLUNKY:** See what I mean?

*With a growl, McManly reaches into his pocket and pulls out a handful of shotgun shells.*

**FLUNKY:** (CONT'D) Oh, right, because you just *happen* to have extra ammunition in your pocket.    
**MCMANLY:** I'll show *you* what's in my pocket!

**FLUNKY:** ... You're not talking about your shotgun, are you?

*McManly drops his shotgun and its shells, then unzips his pants. Flunky's eyes go wide.*

"**Kings.**

&gt; In this modern variation on the David-and-Goliath story, David Shepherd, a brave warrior in a city under siege, wins the gratitude of his king by rescuing the prince from enemy territory. His ensuing fame and rise through the ranks earns him the affection of the king's daughter, but David begins to realize it's getting harder and harder to tell his allies from his enemies. Although the series is loosely based on the Biblical story of King David, it is set in a kingdom that is culturally and technologically similar to the present-day United States.

It has Ian McShane  in it, what more do you need to know?

"Sure. So I was probably about 12 or 13 (24 now), so this was a little over 10 years ago. All I really remember is one night my dad was asleep while my mom and siblings were gone. It was probably 9 or 10 PM. I was sitting in our living room on my laptop with the light on, but everything else was off so it was silent. Suddenly, I heard this female voice whisper in my left ear to get out of the house. It was a quiet whisper, but distinctly female. I looked around me and saw nothing, so I started panicking and tried waking my dad up who largely dismissed it and went back to sleep. When my mom got home, I cried even more and begged her to sleep with me because I was so afraid. The entire rest of the night, even when my mom was lying next to me, I kept hearing it whisper over and over to get out of the house. Since that night, I've never heard it again or had any other bizarre experiences except I was once awoken in the middle of the night by a whisper in my ear going ""Haaaaaaaaaaa"" as if it were exhaling forcefully, and I remember running out of my room freaking out again.

Now, I'm an atheist and a scientist PhD student, so I don't exactly believe in the paranormal.  However, I'll never have an explanation for what happened that night. It traumatized me for weeks to the point that I couldn't sleep alone, and when I started sleeping alone again, I had to sleep with my left ear covered because I was afraid that I would hear it again. I'm not schizophrenic that I know of, but perhaps I had a temporary schizo moment when I was younger. Who knows, but it was terrifying. Sometimes I will still feel an odd sensation in my left ear when I'm lying down at night, and I usually cover my ear with a blanket or something to make it go away."

"Minor vandalism. I'm not talking about spray painting shit and destroying stuff - I'm talking about toilet papering houses, sticking a zillion plastic forks in people's yards and whatnot. 

Coming of age in the mid/late 90s - that's all we did. We would sneak out in the summers and just go raise hell. There were a few summers where I'm sure we kept the toilet paper industry CEOs in their vacation homes. 

We planned that shit out like military operations. We had multiple meeting points since we all lived in different parts of town. If one was compromised, we had 2 other spots to meet at. Same with meeting points if we were ever chased. It even got to the point that we purchased cheap radios and had look outs posted at the end of whatever block we were on. 

Cops got keen to us and we were chased a zillion times. But because we were organized and had plans for this stuff, we were never caught. I remember one time one of our buddies was pinned down out by our baseball fields by a couple cops. He was smart enough to lay down in a low spot where the police couldn't see him and he radioed us what was going on. So we got our 2 fastest runners to create a diversion long enough to get our stranded buddy out of dodge. It worked. We got our runners back and all made it home without further incident. 

Again, I'm not advocating for kids destroying shit. But our career as professional toilet paperers was really a bonding experience for my group of friends. We learned how to organize groups of people, how to work together, and all the running we did had us in pretty good shape. 

Now that we are all adults and have gone our own ways, it makes it awesome to run into each other - Thanksgiving Eve is a good example. Everyone is home for the holiday and hits the bars. Without fail every year most of the old crew runs reunites and we spend hours laughing at the stupid shit we pulled. The favorite story is the night after a storm when we found all the downed tree branches we could and put them on the roof at the high school hanging over the edge. Yeah, it was stupid as fuck and a lot of labor but we did it. Now it's a hilarious story. "

"While yes, I agree that the UN has had its short comings and failures, such as the ramped corruption surrounding their mission in Haiti, I wouldn't say they're not a respectful organization and have netted more good than harm. 

This is the organization that was born out of a global desire to not have another World War and just make the planet a better place to live. The organization that led to the eradication of smallpox, establishing UNESCO which proclaims world heritage sites, promoting nuclear arms control with the 1968 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

"Basically we have a limit because society has to follow the lowest common denominator, sure you used to able to drink and drive above the current limit but then some people took it too far, caused wrecks and killed people. 

The limit now in place (varies worldwide, in Australia its 0.05 which equals 2 std drinks for an adult male) is the line thats been drawn, effectively stating that below that limit you aren't overly affected by the level of alcohol in your system but above it and you are a a higher risk of losing control of your vehicle. These levels have changed over time as science/society have changed their view on what levels of alcohol affect your driving, its not perfect but its the best solution to a problem caused by a minority of selfish dicks. 

I actually 100% agree with you that having an open container of alcohol shouldn't be an issue as long as you are below the legal limit. 

So now we have a deterrent from people drinking and driving because they are afraid to lose their licence, suffer the social stigma of a DUI charge, and have to pay a fine."

"If autistic people are saying this, consider that there might be a reason for that, please. We know ourselves pretty well.

Autistic people are hurt by attempts to make us ""normal"" or ""cure"" us because frankly that would be like ripping out our personalities. 

We often are who we are because we're autistic. It's not just identity politics. It literally shapes our experience of the world, in ways that can be very positive. So that bad shit really is bad. "

"This is where I have to disagree with you. For one, autistic people are at an extremely high risk for mental illnesses like depression and anxiety issues. And for another, on the more severe side of autism, like with thoes who are non verbal, it can be identical to other mental illnesses. While it is a neurodevelopmental disorder, that itself fall under the mental disorder category. However, psychology is a very complicated field where on certain topics there can be an arugment for both sides (like classifying autism and Asperger's as separate or together) and so while I disagree with you, I still see where you're coming from and respect your view"

I used to be a PETA hater myself, but the more you read about them ([from sources that don't come from the meat lobby](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom)), you will find that PETA is dedicated to the cause of helping animals. They even have a hotline where you can call if you find an injured animal, anytime day or night, and speak to a volunteer staffer who will help you help the animal, and will send out staffers/supporters in the area to help you if necessary. I found [this non-PETA resource](http://www.whypetaeuthanizes.com/maya.html) that really changed my views on them."

Also by protesting GMO-technologies and spreading fear they are making it more difficult for universities to develop better foods and plants for us. Many useful crops are not farmed because false information and fearmongering made them too expensive to bring to market (this also makes sure that only big corporations can bring GM-crops into the market).

A woman came in one day and wanted to prepay for four dollars worth of gas on her card, which was declined. She made me scan it a few more times, but it still didn't work. She proceeded to lose her fucking mind. She threw a lighter display on the ground, screamed at me, called me a stupid cunt  and accused me of stealing her money. I shouldn't have, but I asked her to expand on that last point. She said I clearly had figured out a way to route money from her account to mine when her card was swiped. My manager walked out of the office just in time to hear me say ""that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. It's not my fault you don't have four dollars in your account."""

I'd just moved into a new apartment full of heartbreak, and was buying things like a cheap set of kitchen knives, some cheese, wine, and some frozen pizzas.

The clerk at Aldi's said that my stuff would be there for a bit before it got restocked, so if I could get it sorted I could complete the transaction then.

I left.  And I'm sitting in my car in the parking lot using my pocket computer to try to figure out why my money isn't, and a dude comes up to me.  He's like:  ""Hey, I saw what happened back there.  Can I pay for your groceries?""

""No, man,"" I replied.  ""I'll figure it out.""

He plead:  ""Are you sure?  It's no big deal.""

""Yes.  I'm sure.""

He wandered back to his car, and I continued to poke my bank account to see where things had gone wrong.

He came back.  Handed me $50, and said ""What was the total, $43 or something?  Take this.  Keep the change.""

I haven't had much chance to pay it forward, because usually broke, but you know what?  If I've got a dollar and someone (anyone) wants a dollar, I'll give it to 'em.  I don't beat them up about it, it's just like ""Hey, here.  No worries.""

The other day I'm walking into a store and a dude on a bench next to some bagged groceries and an empty pack of smokes says ""Hey, my man.  You got a cigarette?""

I handed him one.  He reached for his wallet, saying:  ""I'll buy two of them for a dollar.""  I handed him another and said ""You can *have* two, but I'mmanot going to sell them to you.""   Told him to take care, went on my way.

If I have, and someone wants (or needs, doesn't matter:  why judge), I give.  Especially after that incident at Aldi where the random dude was insistent on helping me out of a jam that I asked for no help with.

I was taken aback, since I had been zoned out just waiting my turn.  I wasn't going to say anything at first, but this dude was merciless, just ripping into her and degrading her, calling her worthless, etc...and nobody was saying anything, everyone was just silent while he berated her.  

It just really pissed me off and without meaning to I was like ""Dude, what the hell is your problem?  She made a mistake, we all make mistakes.  There's no need to be a fucking asshole.""

I'm a pretty muscular and tall guy, but honestly a nervous wreck, non confrontational and never been in a fight in my life, so I replied ""Why would I do that?"" trying really hard not to show that I was shaking.  He said ""So I can kick your fucking ass!""  

Right on cue, several people in line behind us broke the silence that has set over the checkout area with laughter, and someone said ""You think you can take him?  Look at him, he looks like the hulk"".  He ended up grabbing his shit and leaving with a bruised ego.

They also loved commenting that my skin seemed to have cleared up a bit...yeah, acne goes through cycles for teens, but thanks for letting me know how much you notice my acne and monitor it. Between that and my dad's frequent well meant teasing comments about food (usually of the ""want some pasta with that cheese""or ""want some ice cream with that chocolate sauce?"" style to indicate he felt the items were disproportionate) making me feel that people were constantly monitoring and judging what I ate, it was pretty easy to develop an eating disorder.

Tried to explain this to my dad once.  Took a long time but I got him by explaining who Ed Gein was and what he did and my dad had never heard of him but I pointed out the crimes he committed were when my dad would have been old enough to hear and understand what happened it's just that he never heard about it.  The information wasn't readily available in a 24 hour news cycle from multiple outlets and the internet.  Once I put it to him like that he grudgingly agreed with me.
"To be fair, if you exclude the ones where a waitress can live in a loft in Manhattan, romcoms won't show the boring moments of the characters' life. And if you think that a film can tell a story that goes over a couple of months, it's not far fetched to imagine they will go out, have sex and whatnot.... Hell, if there was a film of my life, you'd see me going out, eat in restaurants, get laid and so on a fair amount of times, while living in the city centre of a big city and working (a little bit more than) full time!"

You learn to self hate. There's a lot of lowkey anti-semitism today. And I can't compare it to the discrimination that the African American, Mexican, or LGBT community face in America, but it still sucks. I personally had to learn to make fun of my heritage.

In 9th grade, in English class reading *Night*, your friends would talk in whispers about the subject.

The craziest thing? Anti-semitism is okay in our society. Jew isn't just an adjective anymore it's an insult. Because the Rothschilds and those Jew globalist bankers rule the world and their scum Jew lawyers protect them.

As someone who is definitely disenchanted with Israel, it sickens me the way that people talk about that country. Netenyahu is an awful person and I can disagree with Israel's handling of Palestine, but Israel was borne as a country of genocide survivors and immediately the surrounding Arab nations tried to finish what Hitler started.

For thousands of years Jews have been the scapegoats for whoever's issues and it's sickening and painful and people can't be who they are because of it and I don't think that's talked about enough in society.

Anti-semitism is one of the only socially accepted forms of racism, and as a Jew that was forced to self hate, that sucks."

"Turtle Hard Shell Wax. Can, not the spray wax. Also obtain about a half dozen new or very clean microfiber towels. Wait for a cloudy or cool day- you don't want to try waxing your car on a hot sunny day. Wash your car thoroughly &amp; DRY. Apply a SMALL amount of wax to the applicator pad that comes with the can of wax and then rub it onto your car gently. Once a small section of your car is waxed, buff it out with a clean microfiber towel, running it over the surface of the paint in circles which will rub the wax in a layer over the clear coat and remove any excess product. Only wax painted surfaces, don't wax glass or chrome or plastic. They will get stained or foggy. You won't be happy with the results. Do small sections of your car at a time or you'll regret it once it dries and you're *still* out in your driveway for hours trying to buff out the wax after the sun has set wishing you had heeded this strangers advice."

"It was Muslim on Muslim genocide driven by ethnic divisions—the East Pakistan Awami league had won the elections and should have formed a new government, but the previous Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto refused to leave and colluded with his Army chief to unleash genocide on the Eastern half of the country, beginning with a Katyn-style campaign of mass murder against the Bengali intelligentsia. Religion had nothing to do with it, other than Islamists being in favor of it because the West was far more fundamentalist-friendly than the East (and has only gotten worse thanks to Saudi Wahhabi propaganda).

It took (majority Hindu) India's intervention to stop the killings. The US sided with the genocide, as did the British, and tacitly China. Nixon sent a task force centered on the USS Enterprise to the Bay of Bengal to intimidate the Indians. The Soviets sent a nuclear submarine flotilla to counter this. Eventually the Indians prevailed, but it's clear who the villains were in this tragedy.

Of course, this pales against the Holocaust or Stalin and Mao's crimes, or the Armenian, Cambodian and Rwandan genocides, or the wars in Congo. In terms of sheer horror, some of the deeds in Rwanda cannot be surpassed (children being dismembered with machetes and killed in front of their parents before killing the latter)."

"&gt; They are talking about watching multiple tables to fine the hot ones and then playing those

No, they aren't. I live in Vegas and play blackjack periodically, and can't even fathom how the logistics of watching multiple table would work without surveillance camera. You don't identify a ""hot"" table by watching for players to start winning; you identify it by knowing how many cards worth 10 are left, which takes constant watching.

Card counting refers to keeping track of the number of cards that are worth 10 left in the shoe. It's not at all difficult to do. But in order to make this work for you, you have to do one of two things:

1) Watch a table closely (NOT multiple tables) until it gets ""hot"" and then sit down and start playing. Most casinos won't let you sit down once half the shoe has been played, specifically in order to avoid people doing this. The [MIT blackjack team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Blackjack_Team) ruined this for the rest of us.

2) Greatly vary your bets based on the cards that have been played. But if you start varying your bets in this way, the casino will ask you to leave.

So a open world game with a more reative and fluid ai system hmm you could make it a futuristic world so autogenerated voices could be used so dialog of characters can be improved. Now that I think about it this sort of adaptive world is similiar in concept to westworld. the thing about such a game is how much control you have what would be to have the option to craete your own dialog perhaps through some sort of voice recognition and if it messes up that  is what the characters hear and you have to deal with it. AI in games could be better but a problem I believe them is they would reat with each other and everyone could be dead before you got to your destination

Young doctors aren't even making guesses anymore, they seem to be strictly following training, and covering their ass legally, and passing all diagnostics off to lab/imaging. Then, based on the interpretation of those results the young doctors prescribe the corresponding treatment.
The older doctors, rely on their own experience and knowledge to form their own diagnoses with less of a need for lab/imaging. Even if they do turn to imaging, they'll look at the images themselves, whereas the young ones seem to go entirely off of radiologist reports. "

"It because the magnet that the arc reactor was powering needed to be precise. Too much power and it would have ripped the metal right out of chest and killed him. Too little and the metal keeps pushing inwards. As far as using normal batteries and the like, well, normal batteries lose power over time. Even a small amount of time without the power to the magnet can be near fatal. The arc reactor can never lose its charge, therefore Tony decided it was the best way as they probably didn't have the technology to perform a surgery to remove them. (This comes later after they get tech from the Chitauri, and later, Ultron) it's not that the reactor needed to be part of the person to power the suit, it's just that he needed it to keep himself alive. In later movies, after the reactor was removed (Iron Man 3?) he no longer needed it, but kept it on the suits."

"The new testament as a text is actually very reliable. There are a ton of copies from different times, countries, and hands showing that other than small textual variants or obvious scribal error, we can confidently say that the Catholic church didn't monkey with it.

Church councils in the pre-Roman Catholic years did deliberate doctrine, usually in response to perceived heresy as a way of codifying  orthodox positions based on the scriptures, but they didn't ""make up"" new ideas. They aren't secret, you can find copies of what was written online.

""Prince of Peace"" is a title found in Isaiah as part of a messianic prophecy. It would be extremely hard, well nigh impossible to claim the Catholics made it up or borrowed that title when the book was written between 700 and about 680 BC.

I'm sure the Vatican has all sorts of weird stuff locked away, but Christianity was a thing before Roman Catholicism was. If you'll recall, in the early days, Rome was burning and executing Christians."

"Growing up, there was this girl - Stella - who would sometimes live with my grandmother and aunts. She was a little older than my older sister and we thought she was fascinating but weren't really sure who she was exactly. All our parents would say is that Stella had a hard life and my grandmother would help her out when she needed it.

Stella would disappear and reappear in our lives as the years went on. Eventually, she grew up and moved away, shacked up with some guy. She'd periodically write for financial help and my family would always send her whatever they could. She had a lot of health problems, though, that made it hard for her to support herself.

She got pregnant from some guy and had trouble raising her daughter so far away from anyone who could help. But, my family stayed in contact with her, my father especially, because the little girl - whose name I cannot recall - needed to know there were people who would support her if she needed it.

Stella would send us cards on the holidays and frequent updates about job prospects, her kid's school life, guys she'd meet and lose, her health and, sometimes, not always, ask for money. My dad started seeing her as a bit of a burden, but a harmless burden.

When her daughter graduated fifth grade, my dad sent a congratulations gift and a check for her college account. We didn't know if the money was actually getting put in the college account, but whatever. It was the thought that counted. When he didn't hear back from Stella for a while, he tried calling to see if she'd gotten the gift. He couldn't reach her and got worried. He finally called Stella's case manager, who Stella had mentioned in a letter, and asked her if Stella was alright.

""She's okay. She had a bit of a medical emergency, but it's being taken care of.""

""That's good. We were wondering if she'd gotten the gift for her little girl.""

""What little girl?""

""Her daughter.""

"". . . Sir, Stella has never had a child.""

I remember my mom telling me about this and getting the saddest chills up and down my spine. We *knew* this child. We'd heard so many stories about her for so many years. Stella had created this endearing kid who we all wanted to see grow up to have a happier life than her mother. It devastated the family, particularly my grandmother."

Almost all Cardassians are likeable as persons, but when they act for what they perceive as higher ideals they're just terrifying.

"A lot of kids are locked up in padded cells and it's completely legal. As a society we don't talk about it much but it happens. I've worked with kids like this. There are children and adults who are severely disabled enough that they are a real risk to themselves and to society. We don't like to think about it but it happens. 

I worked in a school that taught some of the most violent disabled children in the UK. These are kids that could break the arms of ex service and police officers and could legally require 4 men to watch them at all times. I say men because some of them had a sexually violent reaction to women.

After being with us until the age of 21, if there was no other alternative then they went to a specialised unit to live in a padded cell. 

I want to add that the majority of these children wanted for nothing in terms of government fianical assistance. I and my colleagues always did the best we could to show love, care and patience in our classrooms. Sometimes we got lucky and made a difference. For example, I worked with a student who was on his way to living in a padded cell if he showed no improvement due to his violent and self destructive behaviour. We happened to click and over the course of 2 years I helped him learn to talk and to interact with others appropriately. I don't work there anymore but I hear he's still doing brilliantly and won't have to go to that unit.

We don't like to think about it or most people don't hear about it but we do have people in our society who are so disabled that there are very few options for how we care for them. "

"Show kind of made him one dimensional. In the books we never actually saw what tortures he did to Theon, Theon just shows up broken as ""Reek;"" we get a whole Reek chapter before it's revealed Reek is Ned Stark's ward. We get hints of what Ramsay did, but we never really know what exactly happened between the characters. 

As the story goes on we get a complex father son relationship between Roose and Ramsay. Roose makes it clear that, in his own way, Ramsay has an affection for Theon while Roose nothing's him. Theon lives because he serves a purpose to Roose and later because Ramsay genuinely wants ""his Reek."" We learn that Roose is no different from Ramsay and that Ramsay has endured his own psychological torture and neglect that he often lashes out on. Ramsay hates Roose and, more importantly, want's Roose's legitimacy. He's a jealous boy with low cunning whose only affection has been what he tortures out of people, but nah, fuck character complexity, let's just make him *evil.*"

"It's just so incongruous with the rest of the film.   It's weird..sure.. and has adult humour references.   But the movie just skirts this slightly dark unsettling vibe for the whole story and in a weird way it makes you cling more the familiar cartoon character who's front and centre.   And then BAM! - in your face psychotic evil villain who's unsettled and unhinged in every way...and that voice.   Easily most unsettling villain even counting adult films I watched when older..they were so predictable, their evilness so mundane.    Judge Doom was legitimately psychotic and it was right in your face!"

EDIT: For those of you who have suggested in comments this is some kind of alert to EMT's responding to an incident, this apparently a myth:
&gt; Unlike what is implied in the gruesome folklore that has come to be associated with these advisories, **their purpose was not to alert rescue workers to the presence of babies at accident scenes**; they were instead supplications to other drivers to exercise additional care, reminders that they shared the road with vehicles carrying children. [Source](http://www.snopes.com/horrors/parental/babysign.asp)

So unless some EMT on Reddit can source a manual where this is addressed in their training, I'm going to conclude this was simply a product promoted by a baby products company marketed to gullible consumers. "

The show made a lot of mistakes but I liked how they humanised the characters, in the book they're purely people who fucked hannah over; we only ever hear her side of the story. That's probably why she's so unliked in the show, because people can see how insignificant some of the things are and how they don't warrant the reaction she gives them.When you humanise people it becomes difficult to hate them thoroughly because you can see why they make the choices they do."

Honestly that was covered in the Area 51 book by Annie Jacobsen and its a interesting point to be made
"I worked at a call center for all of three days.

That was literally the longest that I could last, and I was up with guilt-ridden nightmares for both of the nights in between. The thing is, I wasn't working a sales gig (at least not in the traditional sense): I was a ""talent scout"" for an incredibly shady organization that sought to trick parents into purchasing ""acting and modeling lessons"" for their kids.

There was more to the pitch and the process, of course, but that was the general thrust of things. I'd call people up, enthusiastically recite a script, and then book them into ""one of our last remaining slots."" The kids and their parents would arrive on Saturday or Sunday, go through a fake audition (complete with fake casting agents), and then be instructed to call a given number on Monday morning.

That number, of course, would connect people right back to the call center. They'd be told that the ""casting agent"" had *loved* their child's audition, but that they – the kid – needed to get some additional training. The parents would then be suckered into paying thousands of dollars for six weekends' worth of completely worthless classes... with the caveat that their offspring would be summarily expelled if they missed even one session.

Unless, that is, they paid even *more* money to have their kids stay in the bogus class.

**TL;DR: I could only handle three days as a call-center con artist.**"

"Not always. Religious people put a lot of value in the power of prayer. So when they get told, ""I'll pray for you,"" it's very moving.

If they told you ""I'll put in a good word for you"" you would be appreciative.

This is sometimes equally hard for the 'talkers' since if they dont really know the 'silent' person well they dont know if he's content or not and they don't wish him to feel like an outsider. Sometimes it also feels like the silent person is not interested in what's being talked about and it becomes ankward because I feel like i shouldnt talk any more.

&gt; Weeks later, after the brothers were caught in China and tortured, inmates were forced to watch as the pair were beheaded.

&gt; Lim, who was 20 at the time, said: ""The two brothers were beheaded in front of everyone.

&gt; ""They called everyone to watch as a warning not to flee. The other prisoners then had to throw stones at them.""

&gt; In another incident a woman was stripped naked and set on fire for annoying a guard during interrogation.

&gt; Lim also told of female prisoners being raped by guards and forced to have abortions or even being killed by lethal injection if they became pregnant.

&gt; If the pregnancy wasn't detected until later the woman would give birth, but the baby would be beaten to death or buried alive, she said.

I knew him very well. He had a wife and a baby son at the time. We both went to the same church and he ended up grooming me over a period of time. We met when I was 13 and over the next two years he slowly moved his way into my life through emails and texts. 

To be honest, the attention felt exhilarating in the beginning. I was so amazed that an adult would be so interested in me as he was constantly complimenting me for being so mature, so smart, so strong for dealing with my problems etc. He was a sympathetic ear that I needed, unfortunately.  

It didn't help that I had a really rough home life. My mother and I had escaped from her abusive husband (my step-father) and my biological father had shut me out of his life. I was young, going through a rough/depressing time, and was hurting for affection or attention.

He seemed like a person I could lean on and trust. Someone that seemed interested in how *I* was doing for a change. To a 13-15 year old this means everything since even a normal teenage life feels chaotic. He had been very calculated and patient.

Tore his stomach open and twisted his jacket and shirt around his spinal column. Just tore him to bits and spread his contents over about 100 meters. Blew his head totally apart like a shotgun blast - skull looked like slices of Lunch meat. Bits of jaw bone with teeth Still stuck in them. Anyway I had to search the body because that's what you have to do before it goes to the mourge. I had to untangle the jacket from the spinal column which is a bit of a punish: it gets caught on the little bits that stick out from each disc. Then I had to go find each leg and look through the pockets of the jeans. Found what I think was a kidney in the arse of the pants, that was kinda neat. I'm there on the tracks just going through the motions and I look up onto the foot bridge and See all these people watching and dry heaving. I was confused and wondering what the problem was.

Turns out I'm humming some song and going about this task like I was watering my garden. I didn't even realise I was and didn't even think about it. My offsider was a tad worried. It's one of a few  dozen times I've had to do shit like this but this one stands out due to the pant kidney and jacket spine mess. I got some counselling and went back to work.

I'm 43. I was born in March of 1974.

As a young child I remember playing in the front yard of my grandmother's house in my underwear. Yes, in my underwear. It was in Georgia, it was hot as hell in the summer, and the humidity was high as fuck. The thought of us being abducted/raped simply didn't exist. 

That said, I was nearly abducted. That I another story. 

I routinely rode around in the bed of both my father's and grandfather's pick up, sometime surrounded by water, while they drove down the highway. When we'd get up to highway speed I'd stand up and spread out my arms. I called it surfing. 

At 5 years old I owned 3 firearms. I had a Colt revolver (with a slightly bent barrel), a 22 caliber bolt action rifle, and a 22 caliber tube fed semiautomatic. 

At the age of 6 I was allowed to go fishing with family and friends, without parental supervision. We routinely carried firearms to protect us from wildcats and snakes. I lost count of the number of cotton mouths I shot. 

I remember a Walker County sherrif's deputy stopping us as we were walking down the road, all of us children loaded with firearms, asking if we were going fishing. 

In high school, in Rockingham, NC, we were allowed to bring our guns. We could check them into the office if we didn't want to leave them in our cars.

"There's nothing you can do. Once you both have finally separated (which is a whole other battle of its own) you will move on whenever you're finally ready. Attempting to numb, rush, or alter your feelings towards this person and your situation will 100% hold you back. You can't control your emotions - only your reactions to them, especially when it comes to the grieving process (which is EXACTLY what this is). 
This will never be about convincing yourself out of love. Remember this: you don't have to stop loving someone in order to love yourself first. Just because someone is a negative influence that can no longer be apart of your life, doesn't mean you can't still care deeply for them and wish them nothing but happiness. 

Treasure that duality, as hard is it may be. It's what makes us human. 
What you can do is start taking care of yourself during this period. Obviously, being in a toxic relationship automatically means you haven't done that for awhile. Time to learn or relearn. Start exercising. Find a hobby. Get into therapy. Make new habits and recreate new memories to replace the old. Date or don't date. Begin finding little ways you can challenge yourself everyday and celebrate your wins while learning from your losses. Cry. Bitch. Talk to your friends. Talk to yourself (be nice). And enjoy the little moments where you feel happy again and begin to believe that maybe, just maybe, you'll actually be alright without them after all. 

And boom. One day you'll wake up and you'll have moved on. I, and everyone else who has been where you are right now, can promise you that. &lt;3

"We had one very sweet, soft spoken teacher snap and throw a podium at one of his sophomore students. Just lost it one day and couldn't take another smart ass telling him he was a loser for being a teacher. Didn't actually hit the kid, it was a heavy podium, but apparently was ranting and raving and just went full on crazy. Ran into him a few years later, and he just seems so much more relaxed, and was much happier. 

Another shoved a junior down some stairs. I mean, it was literally 3 stairs, they were attached to one of those trailers, and the kid had shoved him first. But of course he was the adult, and shouldn't have responded in kind. 

Both deserved to get fired, but both of the students were such assholes, that I really really understood where they were coming from. "

"People who insist that there is a certain amount of time that one should grieve or even feel sad about losing a loved one, and if you still miss them one day after that ""appropriate"" grieving time, you need to get over it and move on with your life. 

My daughter has been dead for years and I still bring her flowers often. I plan to keep doing this forever. The amount of people who tell me ""It's time to move on!"" when they hear that I do this is aggravating. "
"You always need to be aware that there may be children in your care who haven't gotten a flu shot. That means, even if your immune system beats the bug without any symptoms, you potentially could pass it off to one of the children under your care whose parents believe that the flu vaccine is optional. 

Kids don't have as tough an immune system as adults, so they're at higher risk for all the nice seasonal colds and flus.

I never used to get the flu vaccine, never bothered. Never got the flu either, can't remember the last cold I got but it's nearly never too. Started getting it recently because I ended up working in healthcare and now we're exposed to patients who may be immunocompromised or just have a low immune system that cannot combat the normal seasonal stuff everyone else can. 

**I'm not necessarily getting the vaccine to protect myself, I'm getting it to protect the people I work with and around - old people, infants, children, organ transplant people, people undergoing cancer treatments. And even if you're not in healthcare, just about anyone would run into the first 3 categories listed, those are people at risk of serious infections from something the general population find innocuous. And I think in general, I believe in leading by example. If I want to convince patients that vaccines are in general a good thing, then shouldn't I be getting it as well?**

If you teach older kids, sooner or later you'll get a question about whether you do X yourself when you tell them to do it. It's the same with people in the medical field. 

As a highly ironic side note, I'm currently down with what I think is the flu...despite having the vaccine. Guess I wasn't protected against one of the strains and that's the one that decided to go around this year."

"“The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two.”

Barrie explicitly states that Peter ""thins the herd"". We don't know exactly how, but that particular phrasing lends itself well to dark interpretations.

It isn't helped by the fact that the first book in the series (yes, it's a series) is set in London, and is narrated by a man who comes off as a bit of a paedophile.

In fact, there's speculation (and circumstantial evidence) that Barrie himself had a taste for young boys. "

"Just to add to what you've said, I think the next direction for a Batman film needs to be a sort of George Romero-esque commentary on why you *need* a Gotham and *need* a Batman.

You can't have Manhattan without the Bronx. 

For a nice place to exist, you squeeze out all of the bad stuff and it has to pool somewhere.

There's a great social commentary to be made about how excluding groups to create perfection creates an equal imperfection elsewhere due to imbalance. Metropolis is allowed to be nice because Gotham sucks. Metropolis is nice because it lacks a conscience and Gotham has feelings, so that's where people go to hurt others.

And the Batman hurts those people.

The only way for Batman to be successful would be to sabotage Metropolis."

I met some cool people who did cosplay as well and tried to introduce her to them. They were very chill people with no drama, stable jobs, steady relationships and with their heads on straight.

If you're only looking at a show empirically for number of jokes, amount of laught per joke, amplitude of drama and action and etc, then there's nothing that stands out about the show. But that's not what it's about, it's more about seeing the world through someone else's eyes and there being a unique beauty in the way they tell a story. It's the soul of how it's made.

We rewind and review famous scenes, such as Robert Duvall and his helicopter gunships during Apocalypse Now, and in the same film Martin Sheen floating up the fake Vietnamese Congo; we watch Willem Dafoe get shot by a friendly and left on the battlefield in Platoon; and we listen closely as Matthew Modine talks trash to a streetwalker in Full Metal Jacket.

We rewind the rape scenes when American soldiers return from the bush after killing many VC to sip cool beers in a thatch bar while whores sit on their laps for a song or two (a song from the fifties when America was still sweet) before they retire to rooms and f--- the whores sweetly. The American boys, brutal, young farm boys or tough city boys, sweetly f--- the whores. Yes, somehow the films convince us that these boys are sweet, even though we know we are much like these boys and that we are no longer sweet.

There is talk that many Vietnam films are antiwar, that the message is war is inhumane and look what happens when you train young American men to fight and kill, they turn their fighting and killing everywhere, they ignore their targets and desecrate the entire country, shooting fully automatic, forgetting they were trained to aim. But actually, Vietnam war films are all pro-war, no matter what the supposed message, what Kubrick or Coppola or Stone intended. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson in Omaha or San Francisco or Manhattan will watch the films and weep and decide once and for all that war is inhumane and terrible, and they will tell their friends at church and their family this, but Corporal Johnson at Camp Pendleton and Sergeant Johnson at Travis Air Force Base and Seaman Johnson at Coronado Naval Station and Spec 4 Johnson at Fort Bragg and Lance Corporal Swofford at Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base watch the same films and are excited by them, because the magic brutality of the films celebrates the terrible and despicable beauty of their fighting skills. Fight, rape, war, pillage, burn. Filmic images of death and carnage are pornography for the military man; with film you are stroking his c----, tickling his b----- with the pink feather of history, getting him ready for his real First F---. It doesn't matter how many Mr. and Mrs. Johnsons are antiwar — the actual killers who know how to use the weapons are not.”

One of the most popular organic pesticides is Bt toxin.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis  Yes, the very same Bt that was transformed into corn and soy to make two of the most successful GMOs out there.  Except the levels of the toxin present in GMO crops are far lower because it's present throughout the tissue and doesn't need heavy external application.

It's 'organic' because it's a natural pesticide.  You can also apply stuff like copper and sulfur, or even detergent.  And yes, they are very often used because most organic production is still monoculture and very susceptible to pests."

"MtF, but a few things I distinctly remember but only now recognize as signs were pointed out by my therapist. 

My brother and I would play videogames together a lot, or I would watch him play. There was a tank game for n64, and one faction you could play as was entirely women and I loved them so much I even made a little outfit with their logo and everything at like age 10. It was only until years later I realized their logo was some variation of the female sign thing (♀).

Watched my brother play Daggerfall and was super excited to create my own character. Where he made a brute orc warrior, I made a dark elf sorceress.

In middle school I used to wear women's underwear underneath my boxers, partially because I knew I wasn't ""supposed to"" having grown up in a conservative area with a religious family. I liked them though. They felt nice. This promptly stopped after my first experience in gym. After that point I got extremely paranoid about anyone seeing me ""play dress up"", and over compensated a lot with how manly I was supposed to be.

When I went with my dad and my brother to a long time family friend's place, I would always go hang out with my brother's friend's older sister as well my dad's friend's daughter. I was extremely sad and confused as to why I couldn't hang out with them later when we all got older.

It wasn't until I was a junior in high school (I'm 23 now) and almost sick of it all so much that I almost ended my own life that I found out trans people were a thing. Really being a girl I thought I just was but conditioned to thinking I wasn't, and finding out transition was a real thing... That was the turning point in my life.

I made a promise to myself to transition after college and work my ass off to let the little girl in my childhood know she wasn't weird or confused. Honestly? Now that I'm home and done with college, with my degree, transitioning, I couldn't be happier. I hope everyone else who's confused about my transition at least sees that."

"While I agree it's not something that can be cured, it would be nice for many people and their families if it could be. As I stated in my other comments, no two people have the same experience with autism, while it may just be a different way of thinking for you, it could be a paralizing condition that stunts any chance of living a life. This can be found in this mainly who are nonverbal. I wouldn't be the same if I wasn't autistic, but I also wouldn't be the same if I was born with blonde hair. I do wish I wasn't autistic myself. But I know it's not something that can be cured or fixed and it's horrible to find one because that takes time and recouces on helping people deal with being autistic."

"I am high functioning and would not give up my brain for anything.

I am essentially ""stealth"" autistic in that no one would know I have ASD unless I point out portions of it. As such most people just get jealous that I could walk into class, glance over a study guide that I had never seen once, and ace the test. And still remember that information years later.

But what you say about some stuff being hard is true too. I am also, as best as I can describe, spacially dyslexic. Essentially I can never tell the difference between left and right without some kind of reference. On top of that I have memory icons of everywhere I go, and can visualize them extremely well (though often mirrored because of the left right thing) but I can not for the life of me remember how all those places fit together. Life for me is like a series of highly detailed but entirely disconnected rooms.

As such I am literally perpetually lost. I never know where I am or how I got there. It would be a lot harder to deal with but GPS on our phones has gotten amazing.

The worst part about it is not really being able to drive, as if I space out often find myself driving down the totally wrong side of the road. It also worries me when driving that I have no idea how I get to places I get to. Seems unsafe."

They got the most expensive total package cable on her request. He would also pay her portion. But her and her boyfriend (later fiancé) would rent movies all the time on it and the other girls still had to split the cable. So while she had rent and utilities free they were paying an equal amount in cable for her expensive rental habit that her ""portion"" was paid for.

"I gave the shortened version.

The long version is, we were out kayaking close to the beach.  He decides to jump off the kayak and grab a fish and throw it on the kayak.  This fish is just trying to basically burrow it's way out of the kayak, flopping around, hitting me, and I'm screaming at him to get the fish off the kayak.  He starts laughing at me and then later, after we got back to the car and after we drove everything back, the fish still shaking, he decides to just slice it's stomach open laughing maniacally, and going ""yeah, YEAH ya little fucker.....""

The guy was a sadist, basically.  One for laughing at me not wanting  a fish flopping around for it's life on the kayak I was supposed to share with him, and two for torturing a fish for no reason.

He stabbed someone years ago, and unsurprisingly, he's currently serving a sentence in prison after trying to do it again.  "
"There was this one lady, she had a card I'd never seen before. She was trying to purchase around 20 bucks worth of stuff from our gift shop. The card kept declining, the machine was saying something about vendor not being recognised which was really weird, none of us had seen it before, since we accepted everything.

She couldn't handle it, saying that we were wrong, you HAVE to try it again. The reject receipts were piling up on the desk and she was reaching her boiling point.

Honestly, I think she was embarassed, she started insisting that it should work, it was her savings account, she had *FOURTEEN THOUSAND* in it. You as a lowly cashier should be amazed and groveling for my business! 

I tried everything I could think of the make that off yellow, red striped, blue branded stupid card work, but no dice. She swelled with rage and then receded into herself again. She vowed to be back after lunch, I hoped it would be the last I would see of her.

She did come back after lunch, went nuclear again, insisting that the cafe had taken her card and it worked there. Honestly, i think the cafe just gave her the food to get rid of her, since they use the same machines as us. She kept repeating her bank balance like a mantra.

In the end she caved, dug through her wallet, slammed down a $50 and left. I just felt bad for her, but it was pretty crazy seeing how hysterical she was about that card. "

Usually they were probably from non-payment and not fraud, I'd expect, but I didn't question it, only once did I not keep a card due to being threatened with physical harm over it, the guy was really huge and I was only a wimpy 18 year old kid - of course it was an Amex card too :-("

This was back in, like, 1987. And, even as a kid, I knew a LOT more about electronics, cable, and technology in general that he ever did (I was a weird kid). So I knew he was full of shit - not that I didn't check behind the cable box juuuust to be sure. 

So, on the weekends when I was at his house and he ditched me to go on some date / play tennis / whatever, it was all Playboy channel, all the time.

I was on my third stop at a red light waiting to make a left turn and this dude going straight pulls up next to me. After he stops I see him pull out a 2 foot bong and take a massive rip. I've caught people smoking weed while driving or in parking lots but I've never seen another person bring the accoutrements with them to have a full on bong rip.

"Oh man...

**THE CRAWLING ERECTION**: Group study at my gf's home. We studied in groups depending on the subject and I and my gf were in different groups. My gf best friend ended up sitting on my lap, since we were missing some chairs for an unexpected turnout and she was the tiniest and I was the strongest/biggest male. The fact is that she really had an amazing body, she was exactly my type, and while not sitting directly on my crotch as in a sex position, she was pretty damn near. Before I could react and without any control by my side, my erection began to grow but since my penis was twisted and compressed, as it straighten itself getting harder it really seemed like it was crawling under her ass... As she realized, she let out a ""ZioooTroooooOOn??!?!?!"" and there I was... looking at my gf, and her bff, trying to act natural just repeating ""What?.... what?"" she ended it with a ""nothing"". Yes, we ended hitting up after I and my gf broke up.

**2ND DATE SUPPLEX**: The second date with my current gf was a double date, and after a few drinks we decided to move to another place, as we were walking I was like 10m behind to take a phone call. When I finished I started to run towards her to scare her, but the intention was to end it with an hug from behind. I tried to be more menacing the more I got close... it worked... she got scared, stopped, moving backward maybe to try and contrast the shock, but this happened as I was already drunkenly trying to stop and I already had my arms around her. I tried to move to the side to avoid her since I couldn't stop my momentum, but my arms were already holding her and this in a complex series of movements ended up as the most perfect supplex anyone has ever done to a girl on a second date... on a cement sidewalk, in front of her 2 best friends... she recovered without the need for an Hospital (she was quite drunk too)

**THE PONYTAIL HEADBUTT**: I used to have very long hairs and sometimes I made a ponytail. As I was leaning down to push my hair all togheter, my current gf decided it was a good moment to try and kiss me on my nape, just as I was vigorously pushing back my head to push all hair behind on order to be able to collect the ponytail. End result: broken lip, dead tooth (the nerve/blood vessels apparently got damaged and the tooth grew grey(er) over the years), lots of pain.
She was practically uncapable to speak due to the enlarged lip and pain. This happened the night before her last oral exam at the uni.

I got others, but my work time is over, byyyye!! :;D

Just think about periods, if there wasn't already a hole there where would all that matter go? You don't need to be having sex to have a period so a hole wasn't made by someone/something. "
"That the English speak ""correct"" English and Americans speak ""distorted"" English. 

What's actually true is that the modern British accent as we know it today was a result of the aristocracy wanting to differentiate themselves from the bourgeoise that were rising through the social ranks thanks to the monetary boom during the Industrial Revolution. The upper class started using the non-rhotic R (ahh) instead of the rhotic R (are) and that standard trickled down the social classes. 

The way Americans speak English is actually closer to how Shakespeare himself would have spoken (what what! shots fired!!). There are a lot of scholars who believe Shakespeare plays sound much better in the correct (American) English accent since that's how they were meant to sound originally. 

Australians speak with the non-rhotic R as do South Africans because those areas were colonized by the British after the ""British"" accent was developed. 

So. Americans speak correct English and the British are the ones who mutilated our beautiful language. "

"He didn't know he had a living family after he found out Padme was dead, so that's like asking, ""Why didn't he look for the son he didn't know he had."" Why would anyone?

His extended family, and Luke's aunt and uncle, aren't Skywalkers. They're part of the Lars family, and he knew they were there. But, they were inconsequential. Not blood relatives, or people he ever knew well.

Tattooine is also barely on the radar as a planet. When young Luke Skywalker is growing up, it isn't like there is someone updating Tattooine's galactic Facebook page with mentions of #Skywalker. To know Luke was there, you'd have to first suspect he was alive, then go to Tattooine and see for yourself. Anakin/Vader didn't really want to go back since *Attack of the Clones* out of sadness, shame, and regret. While it's only Legends canon now, there were was a book with Vader's perspective in it that describes how he gets weaker in places that remind him of his old life as Anakin, because he can't maintain his rage as constantly. That's why I love *Rouge One*, when they reveal Vader's personal sanctuary isn't on Courascant, but on Mustafar where he was disfigured. It keeps him angry, and thus absorbed in the Dark-Side to stay strong. Like, if he actually stepped foot on Tattooine and went to see his step-brother in *A New Hope* he'd likely have curled up on the ground and started crying... which is a whole different level of terrifying."

"On Reddit, at the very least, people incessantly quote television shows.

Don't get me wrong, it's great that folks have things they enjoy. The problem is that the references in question aren't at all entertaining on their own, and they're apparently only offered because people want to leverage someone else's creativity into a means of turning attention to themselves.

Here, watch:

""I found some wine! I found some wine!""

Without any context, that's just a meaningless repetition of a phrase. You can likely extrapolate what might be going on in the scene from which it was taken, but if you haven't actually watched it, the words have very little impact on you. Even if I mentioned that it was from ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" the humor would likely be lost on most people.

Nine times out of then, quoting a piece of media is the equivalent of saying ""I AM FAMILIAR WITH THIS!"" Folks respond positively because they're reminded of the enjoyment they had when watching that aforementioned media, not because the quotes themselves are inherently amusing. (How many times have you seen ""Babou! He remembers me!"" on the Internet, for instance?) When offered to someone who hasn't seen the source material, quotes are pretty damned empty, with the exception being when clever wit or wordplay is employed... but of course, those are rarely the ones that people parrot.

After all, the intention usually isn't to entertain; it's to draw attention.

But then my brother opened  up his final gift and it was an xbox! I was so excited and started hopping around out of joy. He said thank you but that he wanted a Wii instead so my parents said they would trade it in for one. I was crusheddd and started protesting and they got mad and told me it was HIS xbox so I had no say. Man was I heartbroken. It sucked being a girl sometimes, but I never had any hard feelings against my brother, hes pretty cool.

"This. Nobody would call ginger gravol or Aloe Vera gel ""homeopathy""... it's just natural nondrowsy gravol, and burn cream.

And of course stuff like Kefir to help your stomach while you're on antibiotics (probiotics), and some women even put plain yoghurt in their vagina to soothe and cure yeast infections.

"Also...IIRC, if a patient refuses a medical treatment and doesn't have any advanced directives then there's an exception available to the med teams at time.

"Part of it also is that for autistic people, it's a pretty dark organization that wants to be able to detect what they are before birth so parents can terminate them.

When you are living with autism and don't feel like you should be killed, that just feels really, really terrible. 

I understand that people can choose abortion for whatever reasons, but it's hard to explain how it feels to have an organization which wants to help parents never have to deal with people like you when you don't think you're bad enough that all people like you should be wiped out. 

I know I'm using extremist wording, I'm trying to explain some of the feeling that some people have toward the organization, and I know, as a scientist, you care more about fact that feeling, but I'm just trying to help you see it from that perspective. Also, I'm biased."

"I was doing ecstacy one night at my house and started to feel funny so I went in the kitchen for water and all of a sudden the world rushed in front of me and my heart rate jumped higher than it's ever been. I grabbed my phone and had 911 ready to dial because I thought I might have a heart attack (I later realized it was a panic attack) and if I passed out it nobody would have known. 

I calmed down some finally and decided to go to bed but I just couldn't sleep. I was being haunted by some episodes of SVU I watched earlier I couldn't get out of my mind. For a whole week after that night every time I noticed the sun go down I'd start getting anxious and I lived with a sense of dread. I kept feeling like someone was waiting outside to break in and I'd check the doors and windows over and over. Any noise would startle me and I could barely sleep. It was awful. I still get triggered sometimes with anxiety by things that remind me of that night.

When she died, she had no heirs and no will so my stepdad inherited all the dolls and my job for several months was to post them all on eBay (it was circa 2000 and at 16 or 17 I was the only internet-literate person in the house). We got the weirdest emails and questions from buyers.

""What's their personality like? Are they happy? Do they get along well with other Cabbage Patch Kids? What about other kinds of dolls?""

""Can you tell me who in your collection he/she was closest to? I wouldn't want to break up a friendship or a family.""

I still have nightmares about Cabbage Patch doll collectors."

"The Franklin Coverup

Last Podcast on the Left has a pretty good episode on it. Basically, there were a few people who claimed to have been abused a children by people very influential in the US government. Certain details line up very closely with reality, but unfortunately I feel that the claims weren't taken seriously for a number of reasons, the most obvious being that the alleged abuse victims were drug addicts and criminals. Some claims were also very very hard to believe. Go a bit beyond the wikipedia article if you want to research it, LPotL is a pretty good place to start."
"Oh God, I've watched so much Reba.  I was unemployed and was having real difficulty finding a job, and it was hard to get out of bed in the morning.

I never laughed, because the jokes were tired or telegraphed 100 yards away, or were terribly-delivered.  But I watched so much Reba."

"The six months I was in hospital with an eating disorder. 

To preface: I was a compulsive exerciser - and addicted to exercise to boot - severely anorexic, 67lbs (31kg) and going through renal, hepatic, and cardiac failure. I could fill an AMA with the details, but to put it bluntly I was falling apart, both physically and mentally. My bones were riddled with stress fractures from exercising 14 hours a day and running a marathon a week, oedema reverberated up my legs with every step I took, my body was a rough patchwork of scars, and my skin was sloughing off. Things ultimately came to a head when I was on a run one night and my heart sputtered and just -- Stopped. I went into a panic, and started coughing and thumping my chest, and thankfully it worked. I was voluntarily admitted into the unit on my father's birthday, 14th December. 

It was unlike anything I've ever experienced before.  I was surrounded by every permutation of illness possible, with their problems pressing down on me like a second skin even whilst I tried to grapple with my own disorder.

The desperate and needy clashed with the aloof and angry, and woven throughout were those staunchly convinced that they'd no need to be in such a place; they were (perhaps cynically) called the 'lifers' by patients and staff alike, though never to their faces. These were the people actively conspiring amongst themselves to starve, to break bones and burn from the inside out to remain as they were. And I mean that literally; the stomach acid and bile got to such a state that ulceration of the stomach and oesophagas was common in chronic sufferers.

There's an entire subculture to anorexia that's really quite appalling; I was never one of those to be pulled in by the 'pro-ana' craze - thin though I was - but I knew dozens of people sucked in and lost to it. Equally, there's little that remains private in a population like that. There's such history, such close-knit and corrosive friendships formed around the same method of suicide, that everyone knows everyone in twisted, symbiotic relationships spanning years. Everyone knew what your particular vices were, and some would actively try to lure you back down that slope, because that was the only form of community they'd ever known.

There were people who saw the truth, of course - Those who saw how fucked up the situation was, and made light of it in the only way we could. Black humour ran rampant as a coping mechanism; even those who had recently died (as many did) weren't spared from it, the memory of them warped into a caricature of the illness so we could remind ourselves of how dangerous it all was. We'd escape to ourselves to take whatever reprieve we could from the madhouse. The staff members knew who would make it out - who would survive - and who wouldn't; some had lived in the same rotation of hospital units since they were in single digits, and hadn't made an ounce of progress in the decades since. Some of us flew in and out in a whirlwind, and some went in and didn't come out alive.

I don't regret going in - it saved my life, I've recovered, and I'm happy now - but nor am I so naive as to believe that I escaped unscathed"

"I had a pet crab who predicted my parents' divorce.

Kermit was a hermit crab (*Kermit the Hermit* I had a comic book I wrote about him for a while.) that I got on a trip to the beach. I was probably 4 or 5. Kermit lived for fucking ever. I was 18 when my parents separated, and he was dropping warning signs all over the place.

Having him for 12+ years, I went through every possible iteration of theme for his aquarium/terrarium. Sea castle, sand castle, medieval castle (most were castle based.) Urban cityscape, bucolic countryside, and Japanese garden. Been there done that. 

Eventually what I did was put a bunch of small stones with words painted on them into his tank. Just random gibberish and typical magic 8-ball answers. *Ask again later.* But also *Telephone.* And *Serendipitous.* This allowed me to have conversations with KTH where I would speak to him and his answer would be whatever stones he crawled over. *Hey Kerm, who's going to win the Super Bowl?* **Chowder.** Cool Kermit, real cool.

Eventually KTH started moving the stones around his tank. He'd bring certain ones up to the front, and I quickly realized he was sending coherent messages to me. *It's Over.* And *The End.* *Friction.* Etc. It got to be spooky. My mom and dad were fighting a lot more-- my dad was working longer hours and my mom thought he was having an affair, which sparked most of the fighting.  I thought it was surreal that a crab could pick up on that. I told my parents about it and they thought I was nuts.

The absolute kicker though was when I came home and found out my dad had walked into my room to kneel at the oracle of Kermit and my crab had brought forth the stones that said *Who?* and *Horse!* Which he apparently thought was Kermit's rough approximation of *Who is the whore?* And he got so angry he put my crab down the garbage disposal.

After that, my mom figured my dad was an unhinged psychotic person and divorced him. Kermit called that one, that's for sure.

"I wouldn't say he was necessarily better then Azula. He himself even described her as gifted. Plus he's her father, and the Fire Lord. That alone gets him tons of respect/intimidation points.

If you look at his fight with Aang, he demonstrates only one ability that is arguably rare: breathing fire. Iroh does this, claiming it's part of the title dragon. Zuko has a ""breath of fire"" (end of book 1), which seems to be a lesser form of this ability. With the comet in effect this could easily be the same ability amped up.

Other then that, lighting we've seen from Azula, Iroh, and several other master benders. Most of the forms he used were pretty standard fire bending moves for a well trained fire bender, amped up by the comet.

On the flip side, people often argue that the blue fire Azula used was a sign of her incredible power. People often forget that Azual is not just the daughter of the fire lord. She is also the granddaughter of Avatar Roku. Both sides of her family come from a long line of powerful benders. She was also a very skilled tactician. Between the control of the Dai Li, her performance during the volleyball game on Ember Island, and other instances, it's clear she has a very capable mind that is able to spot and exploit weaknesses.

Also note that she managed to do what Ozai never managed to do: kill Aang (this is somewhat debated, but I personally think she did)."

My old roommate sold knee injections. They had 2 products. The '3 series' (i.e. 3 separate injections) and the 'Single Series' (a single injection). The Single series is cheaper and more effective.

He told me he would go in to offices and say, ""I have this Single Series product billed at X rate by Z,Y&amp;X insurance companies. I also have this 3 Series that you can bill at X rate each visit with those same Insurance companies. So lets make some money Doc!""

Spoilers ahead. 


3 Seasons (maybe 4). Season 1 introduces us to everybody including Brian. Dexter goes after a more generic serial killer. Season 1 ends with Dokes just starting to become suspicious of Dexter (not all along like they did). Season 2 builds the suspense between Dexter and Dokes while Dexter tracks the Ice Truck Killer. Dexter finds out who Brian is. Season 2 ends with Dexter killing Brian and Dokes sees it. Season 3 is the all out battle between Dokes and Dexter. Season 3 (maybe the entire series) ends with Dexter killing Dokes (going against his rule of only killing other serial killers) and this time Debra sees. Dexter kills himself or Debra kills him. "

On start of hostilities, the BEF was to march into Belgium and meet the Germans close to their border. What the British/French planners didn't consider (but the Germans counted on) was that the outflow of refugees would clog the roads and delay the British advance. The Stukas ensured that it was a major fuster-cluck for the Allies."

"Except you're confusing mental illness with psychiatric diagnosis. Gender Dysphoria as it exists in the DSM V is first of all antiquated and will likely be removed in the future, and is more representative of a mental variant rather than an actual disorder, like Major depression. The hallmark of mental illness is that there is some level of personal dysfunction or inability to go about your daily life as a result of your illness. Depression does this because you are too apathetic, anhedonic, and low energy to do anything. The only reason there's societal dysfunction with Gender dysphoria is because of society's view, not anything inherent in the individual. So the problem is not with TG people's ""diagnosis"" it's with how they are treated.

When I asked her to show me what she was doing, she took my phone and started singing a song, slightly off key, into it really loudly.  She also replaced the words of the song with ""do do do's.""

"So much this. 

Story time:

So no shit, there I was, in the great capital of the U, S, and A. I was wearing my Flecktarn, because I was a member of the German military, there on official NATO bullshit* business. 

So there's me, enjoying a few hours off by ambling down the national mall, and reliving the days of my childhood with an Air&amp;Space visit. Fuck yeah astronaut ice cream, BTW. While I'm minding my own business, random people come up to me and thank me for my service. Some ask if I'm some sort of high speed low drag space shuttle door gunner, what with my non-standard camo and all. Most, when asked if they know what the flag on my upper arm means, don't know. When asked what my rank means, they don't know. When asked to pronounce my name, they make a noise that is a cross between the wrong pronunciation and a Yorkshire terrier being stomped on. 

So they don't know where I'm from, don't know whom I serve, don't speak the lingo, but they still thank u 4 Ur serbice. Just because I'm wearing clothes that are vaguely military-looking. 

It's weird, man. The thx 4 serbice, the military discounts, the boarding planes right after the disabled, that whole ""soldiers=heros"" culture. I'm no hero, I'm a dude who has a fucking cushy government job that sometimes pays him to shoot guns and play with ebola.

"Splinter Cell Chaos Theory's Spies vs Mercenaries mode was a true unicorn of multiplayer gaming. Asymmetrical 2v2 competitive play which was extremely fun and compelling on both ends.  
  
Sneaky spies played a 3rd person stealth game where they had to infiltrate, secure or hack or extract objectives, and avoid detection. Crawling, climbing, cloaking, and outwitting the brutish security guards with no lethal force other than your bare hands. Mercenaries played an FPS that involved laying lasers and mines, toggling between multiple vision modes (motion sensing, electromagnetic, etc), and shooting the shit out of any spies they could find. Both sides had a pretty steep learning curve with customizable loadouts and balanced abilities that countered one another when used smartly.  
  
It was sort of sick, in that you really got off on dominating the other players. Spies could sneak up behind mercs and put them on choke holds, pull them off ledges, snap their necks, or use them as human shields against their own partner's gunfire. Mercs could track, poison, or blow up spies with well-placed mines and lasers, charge and stun clumsy spies, knocking them on the ground and t-bag a few times before putting a bullet in their brain.  
  
I have never been more emotionally invested in a multiplayer game: totally enraged and humiliated when losing, and feeling the sheer joy of ""playing with your food"" when beating another team. For my partner and I, it was always an unfair fight in one direction or another; stomping noobs, or getting crushed by fucking pros. An evenly-matched round was a truely special experience to be cherished. The maps and modes were extremely well-designed and balanced. As the metagame evolved, each map had the standard ""best"" strategies for both sides, - ideal mine placements for the mercs, optimum entry points for the spies - but there was real thrill and excitement in subverting those expectations, by coming up with something even more clever, or doing something so dumb that the other team never saw it coming.

Then they did something right with the Wonder Woman film, but then they didn't learn fro their mistake in BvS and their next movie is another team up with 3 returning characters (only 2 of which have gotten their own movies), and 3 completely new characters.
They're trying to catch up to the MCU and jump straight to The Avengers status, but the Avengers would have sucked if we hadn't been introduced to those characters prior to the movie.

"I was never actually a dispatcher, or telecommunicator as they're often called, but I was involved in the technical/administrative side of a statewide system for about 3 years. I can tell you what the trends were like, and I've listened to lots and lots of tapes. The basic flow of calls was something like this:
 
6:00am-8:30am: Calls from family members or nursing homes when someone never woke up from the previous night. 
 
7:00am-10:00am: Traffic incidents from morning commute. Theft and vandalism reports from the previous night as people wake up and businesses open. 

10:00am-2:00pm: Industrial accidents, meaningless squabbles between neighbors, old people calling in un-scooped dog turds on the sidewalk.
 
2:00pm-6:00pm: High-schoolers crashing cars, Evening commute clusterfucks, Shoplifting calls, and people arriving home to discover family members who have committed suicide. 

6:00pm-Midnight: Domestic violence. Noise complaints usually caused by drunk and disorderly folks, DUI sightings, armed robberies. 

Midnight-6:00am: More armed robbery, bar fights, structure fires, and the majority of the entertaining sex-related stuff. (real life example: ""My girl has her ben-wah balls hung up inside her virginia, and we're both too drunk to drive to the hospital."" )

Overall, it is a thankless job and everyone who does it is dreadfully underpaid. You are often the first point of contact for someone in crisis who is having the worst day of their lives, and there's little that you can do beyond providing instructions for basic medical care or assuring callers that help is coming. If it doesn't weigh on you, you're not human. There's a lot of substance abuse, and many failed relationships because of the stresses of the job. I was going to give an example of an awful call, but there are so many gut-wrenching NSFL examples that I can think of, and nobody really wants to hear it. 9-1-1 operators hear it all, and have to contemplate the shitty things that people do to each other.

A guest sitting at a table in a corner might be upset that it took me over 5 minutes to help him. Little does he know that I have another 15 tables to take care of outside his field of view.
The trick is to use this knowledge and use it to make your life easier by anticipating their needs and telling them what you know they want to hear. Although everyone likes to think they're unique and 'different' than other guests, I've found there's only a handful of different 'types' of customers. Each with their own preferred way of treatment. After making contact, you *know* what type of guest you're dealing with. All you have to do now is follow the 'script' if you will.

"I work at a well known clothing store, we also sell jewelry in some stores as well. About 2 years ago i was covering our jewelry dept. since our clerk needed lunch, and about 15 min in a couple come up and want to return some items (Our store has a really specific policy for jewelry returns that we HAVE TO explain to every customer when they purchase). So i tell him to let me see the stuff he bought and his receipt. 

This bracelet he had was the most disgusting piece of jewelry i had ever seen in my life, they had it not even a month and it was caked in black gunk, dirt, and im pretty sure he tried to melt it together (the bracelet was broken in two). So i told him no he couldnt return it unless he has a receipt. And he immediately started yelling for the manager, telling customers how our company had ""f*cked"" him, swearing in front of children that were less than 2 feet away.

So im a keyholder which means if theres no manager then im in charge, which was the case that day. So i ask him to calm down and refrain from swearing in our store, and that i was the manager on duty. Now im 24 at the time but i look fairly young and this for some reason pushed him over the edge. He screamed at the  top of his lungs about me being 12 and not able to be a manager, he started trying to rally other customers to get me fired, and at one point he was pushing things off our counters. And this is all before i even got to asking him why he was bringing it back, or if i could look up his receipt.

This went on for almost an hour, at one point he claimed it was fake gold because a pawn shop wouldnt give him what he paid us for it, that care plans are a rip off and they offer them on milk (i really dont know) and he wouldn't buy milk in this county anymore, and more general weird stuff.

She also claimed he assaulted her while so drunk he pissed himself (iirc), moments after he attended a gala looking pretty sober, and then was sober and clear-headed early the morning for an open PR meeting. Which, sure, maybe he just hides his hangover well. But what really popped the air out for me was the fact that she claimed he beat her up on a date when he was out of the country...

I had forgotten that I printed out a few pictures and they were left on the printer over the weekend, and on Monday, our secretary found all the pics I printed, and there was a lynch mob out for whoever printed them. I would always clear my history, but it lead to us finding out that there was an employee who left his computer on all weekend logged into a porno site that everyone in the office ended up seeing.

He KNEW the space vehicle they wanted to send him up in was not ready.  There were all sorts of technical issues.  Komarov was certain whoever they tried to send up on that mission would never survive.  

Problem is, the Soviet politicians needed the mission to be a go.  They refused to listen to any talk of delays.  ""Shut up and get it done.""  

Komarov could have refused, but he knew that they'd just stick the mission on the next cosmonaut on the roster.  The only other cosmonaut on the roster was his close friend.

"Some are done well, others done poorly. *Saving Private Ryan* and *War Horse* obviously did a better job than *Fury* or *Enemy at the Gates* and to a lesser degree, *Inglorious Basterds*: while the former two films took the time to develop characters on both sides and portray them properly, the latter two just make German soldiers mindless drones or else pure evil parodies of humans. 

Sometimes the pure evil depiction is justified: in films like *Schindler's List* or *Come and See*, legitimate events are being shown which portray German soldiers acting precisely how they acted in real life. Only when films stray into fiction to these characterizations become muddled.

Films made by Germans, such as *Das Boot* or *Downfall*, are very good at depicting the German standpoint because the parents and grandparents of all the actors, producers, directors, etc, experienced WWII and its horrors firsthand. They show the evil, but they balance the human element expertly, and if you haven't seen these films, I suggest you do immediately. 

I have not yet seen *Dunkirk*, but I hope to soon. I hope they portray Germans well."

It's pretty common to hear, medical students hate it because they feel devalued, most actual doctors don't care in the real world(if you want to misrepresent your position, go ahead), but if you call yourself a medical student in the clinic, I will bring you to your supervisor, and if that doesn't work, admin. a M3 or M4 is very, very different from a nursing student, or MA student or whatever lol.

Three of the sightings are supported by video footage of birds with flights, behaviors, field marks, and other characteristics that do not seem to be consistent with any species of the region other than the ivory-billed woodpecker. Nobody has managed to obtain indisputable photographic evidence for the persistence of the ivory-billed woodpecker, but the paper contains an analysis based on factors related to behavior and habitat suggesting that such evidence is unlikely to be obtained in time to make a difference in the conservation of this species.

Then I had a surgery which needed me to take something like 16 pills a day for a while 

What worked for me was using Sprite or 7 Up! My issue was that I could always tell where the pill was, and it would always end up just landing back on my tongue. With soda, because it's carbonated, you can't tell the differences between the bubbles and the pill so it all just goes down as one. I would always be pleasantly surprised that it worked out so easily. 

Hope this helps somebody out!"

"Fact: you have it backwards. ""Gender dysphoria"" is defined in the DSM as the discontent experienced by some people resulting from gender identity issues.

Transgenderism does not stem from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria results from transgenderism, in some people.  The APA says ""gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.""

"First of all I appreciate you taking the time to hear both sides before coming to a conclusion. The other problem is people **only** know the Armenian side of the story since Turkish side is supressed (illegal to deny the term Genocide in several countries). 

The Turkish side is that many Armenians were massacred by irregulars and unruly Ottoman officers during the relocation process. Appearently this was in revenge to what happened to their side by Armenian revolutionaries (i.e. hunchak and dashnaksutyun) but was not official state policy to do so as implied by the term ""death marches"". The Turkish side denies the term Genocide because they believe the guy (Raphael Lemkin) who coined the term was under the false assumption that this was an attempt to eradicate Armenian people. He was also present at a trial of Soghomon Tehlirian, the guy who assassinated Enver Pasha in Berlin which probably influenced his opinion. 

Obviously things are less black and white the further we go into details but the official Turkish stance (which you can look up on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website) acknowledges the massacres as a dark page in Ottoman history but denies the implications that come with the term Genocide and denies current Republic of Turkey has any responsibility for the decisions Ottoman Government decided to take in 1915 . The Armenian side is obviously not happy about this since they feel like it's downplayed. 

Many people are also under the false assumption that Turkey is trying to sweep this under the rug which is not true because countless times they invited Armenia to open their archives and join a Joint Historical Commission. "

"- do not stay attached to any of your friends. know that people will come ago, it'll either happen immediately or a few years into high school. enjoy the people you're surrounded with while it lasts.

- this one's kinda related to the one above, make sure there is a balance in what you do during HS. if you're part of an AP class, the football team, the school play, and the school council, you're definitely going to get overwhelmed. make sure if you do join in any after-school stuff, manage your time wisely so you don't get stressed.

I lost my mother 20 years ago and I have come to accept grieving the loss of a beloved parent never really goes away, and that is okay. It is a longing that changes color in different phases of your life. For instance I missed my mother in another way when I became a mother myself.

But I have accepted I need to take care of myself as if I was my mother. I listen to my intuition and inner guidance and do what is good for me. Besides I am now the mother of someone else, and my son knows of my mother too.

By the time he was three he would mention when she was waving at him, and also he pointed towards some electrical devices in the corner and told me she said to him: ""Don't touch those wires over there"" (even though they're all tucked in safe, but she said it and we all know mom knows best :)).

"Fun trick:

Take a piece of paper. Fold it in half. Fold that in half the other way. Fold it in half again to make a triangle. Do that one more time so you have a narrow wedge of paper.

Fold about two inches of the point of that wedge back. Now take a sewing needle and poke it through where you just folded it so it goes through and back, perpendicular to the long axis of the wedge. The needle should be firmly held by the paper. Take the open end of the wedge and flare it out to make a bit of a horn shape.

Get an old crappy record you don't mind getting a bit scratched up. Put it on the turntable and start it up, but don't put the actual stylus on it. Instead, grip the paper horn where the needle is attached and gently hold the needle in the groove of the record. You should be able to hear the recording plainly through the paper horn."

"That's a fair point. The odds of winning the lottery are astronomical, but it still has a good reputation. But I think it's the blatant dishonesty that makes it a scam. Having a plant in the audience to spread false hope, deliberately making it impossible to win.

They're also just... shady. I mentioned standing behind the guy will show you what he's doing. The audience plant noticed my friend and I getting frustrated (we were waiting in line for a public toilet because he has awful planning skills) and asked if we wanted to play. We declined. My friend pulled out his phone to pass the time, and the plant walked up to us again and very menacingly said ""no pictures.""

"""Now cheating is seen as the worst thing ever""

I dont know about that. It seems like every new movie or show has some form of cheating. I just recently finished the new Netflix show Friends from College and I really liked it because it was a good show with a great cast! But the entire time I watched it, it was like they were trying to normalize cheating. The whole point of the show is how two married characters (who you root for) are cheating on their spouses with each other. That was just one example of how I feel media is making cheating out to be just a regular thing that happens in life

"A huge chunk of animals that PETA euthanized are surrendered to the organization by their guardians. PETA offers free/low cost euthanasia to the community so folks will bring their sick/old/dying animals and PETA will perform this service (hence the 24 hours. PETA is the legal guardian in most cases because the police have ordered the animals be surrendered or the guardian needs the euthanasia service) Euthanasia can be extremely expensive and many of these people are extremely poor. PETA rarely ""takes in"" adoptable animals. If they are adoptable when they are surrendered (during fieldwork. PETA doesn't do ""drop off"" surrender like a standard shelter. Those folks are referred to the local SPCA) then PETA will send them on to a partner shelter. What most people don't realize is that if PETA fieldworkers have been surrendered an animal, most of the time it's because the animal was found neglected and in horrible shape (cancer, catastrophic injury, starving, dead puppies/litters, prolapsed vagina/anus, etc) or dying of old age/old age related ailments. PETAs ""shelter"" serves the absolute last resort, serving most neglected, and most impoverished in the area. I could go into the history of why PETA got involved in the area in the first place but tl;dr they were shooting or gassing animals to death and asked for PETAs help."

"I think right around the time we evolved to become social creatures. Seriously, I've had a think about this and creatures are social because it gives them an evolutionary advantage, and to that end it's important for everyone in the social group to cooperate. If someone is not cooperating, that is a problem for the group so the other members of the group are invested in solving this problem. Of course ""solving the problem"" translates as bitching to everyone who will listen about the person who they think is being weird or acting out until they either force the person to conform or kick them out of the group.

Basically I think talking about other people is something intrinsic with humans and you'll never get away from it."
"I'll start: there's a guy who posted a couple of months ago about his wife withholding food from his young children by denying them any between-meal snacks and strictly limiting their mealtime portions. He said that his wife was extremely concerned with health and was fearful that snacking would lead to obesity. However, his eldest pre-teen daughter was medically underweight and he was worried about her. He said his kids would beg him for snacks like apples and he would oblige, and his wife would get angry with him. Posters asked about portions and they were extremely small, suitable for perhaps a toddler, but not for pre-teens. After being run through the wringer for allowing his young children to literally go hungry, the OP deleted, of course. I keep hoping for an update where he staged a hard intervention, got his wife counseling, and agreed to provide his kids with healthy food, but that hasn't yet happened. "

"&gt;Let me rephrase that: the day we know how to stop autism from happening is the day we know how to prevent the gay from happening. Is that a road we should work towards?

Absolutely. As unusual as that sounds at first glance, understand the ramifications of that. If you can predict all three conditions, genetic, environmental, and hormonal, and we understand how that creates divergences in standard human behavior, we can pivot that technology to other means. Humans resistant to depression and anxiety, prevention of a myriad of disorders and afflictions, and the ability to enhance future generations. Some people in the spectrum have amazing gifts, detection of patterns that others simply can't see, alternative thinking patterns, yet are crippled with the detriments that come with it. 

Can you imagine what you could do? Identifying a child with autism and shaping how he lands on the spectrum, improving their lives? Absolutely. Autism isn't a disorder at that point, it's a modifier. 

As for ""Preventing the gay from happening"", it would be financially infeasible. No beancounter at an insurance agency or research lab would justify millions or billions in research to approve it. Gays in society operate normally, paying taxes and working jobs, while a large chunk of people on the spectrum are on disability or require care."

"&gt; white privilege"" is not in any way saying that all white people are privileged. It doesn't mean that you, as a white person, can never struggle; it means that you will never struggle because you're white. Every white person has white privilege, whether they live in a mansion or a shitty apartment. I see so many people go on about how much their family struggled so there's no way they have white privilege, and that's just not what the fuck it is.

This. I also see white people loathing themselves because of other warped views of what white privilege is. They think that white privilege is somehow supposed to magically make life easier if they have some shit circumstances (let's say homelessness).

(Western) Society doesn't assume the white man steals everything he has, is naturally more inclined to criminal activity, or is somehow worse than anyone else until he does something until he actually proves these stereotypes - and even then, he can eventually be forgiven. Brown folks don't get that- they 'prove' the stereotype by existing. And when they commit a crime, they are some how the scum of the Earth compared to their white counterpart. "

The Mole Man dude is the only random actual super villain. And he could be handled by the national guard. 

We assume there were loads of villains for the heroes to fight, but what evidence is there actually _of_ that? The supers were basically really effective domestic protection and PR. But when the PR turned sour, they were retired. If there was a legitimate need for them, that wouldn't have happened. "

"Great-granny was well known to be adventurous, a trait passed down through that side of the family for sure. She was also very, very short, which is another wonderful trait she passed on.


She recently had moved to a very small town, a recent settlement of recent immigrants and former miners. It was located on a plain, with the native settlement on the side of a nearby mountain, separated by dense forest. They only knew each existed, beyond that, nothing. Being a woman without a household or much money - though at that point I believe she was *at least* engaged - there wasn't a lot for Great-Gma to do. The town was fairly progressive for the time so it wasn't unusual for ladies to wander around alone, but she took it a bit further by foraging, and drawing, outside town, some books of which we still have and is partly how she met Great-GDad, who studied botany. There are also rumors she could/would go out to hunt but no concrete evidence from what I know.


From what I remember of it, she basically was just running around in the bush (forest) as per her usual habit, and  fell straight through the branches that'd covered the hole over with. Not the first time she'd fallen into one, just the first time she couldn't get out on her own. I'm not sure if it was that nobody noticed her missing, or if this was so common for her nobody worried, but either way, her own folks didn't go looking for her. It was only once she turned up back home with what must have seemed like an army of a tribe, and food, that anyone took notice. Neither group spoke the other's language. But clearly, it didn't end up much of an issue in the long run.


Personally, I love the image of the local tribe thinking they caught a deer or something, only to look down a hole in the middle of the forest, to see this teeny little blonde thing and her pencils.

"I feel that people don't understand the amount of time is needed to change a whole worldview. Segregation ended in the late 60s. People want to believe that racism doesn't exist because we can sit at the same tables, date each other and no one is casually throwing around racial slurs in public (at least not normally). Racism has evolved into something more subtle that many people don't realize or have to think about. This is modern day racism. That mind set that people of different races are less intelligent, don't work as hard or are overall violent. Thinking that people of color just stay in the ghettos because they have no motivation to succeed, or crossing the street when you see them at night. The fact of the matter is that just because we walk the same streets, live in the same neighborhood and work the same jobs, doesn't mean that racism is over. We need time to grow as a species to completely homage this mindset and sadly we are not there yet. However, pretending it isn't an issue does nothing but hinder the solution. The idea that not talking about racism will end it, is ludicrous. "

"This is straight up going to sound like something out of a porno, but it really happened. 

So back a few months ago, I was doing a senior trip to the local water park and we had to group up with 3 other people. Now, there was this girl who obviously hardcore had a thing for me and I wasn't that interested, but being that as it is, she decided to group up with me and the other two in our group  

Now we get to a multiple person tube ride and we all get ready to go, and I sit down first. The girl that likes me sits down really close to me, right on top of my foot. Now this girl was wearing a two piece, but the bottom half had a skirt there as well. I don't know what happened under her skirt, all I know is that my toes were right on her vaj. 

Now I was expecting her to react so that I could move my foot. Nope. Nor could I force my foot out because one, the tube was cramped to begin with, but two, she wasn't the smallest girl (also not the largest either but hey). 

Now we go through the entire ride, my toes rubbing this girls vagina around every bumpy section (at some point I'm pretty sure my big toe literally went in) until the end when we can finally get out. She stands up and doesn't say anything, and I don't say anything as to not be awkward. 

Tl;Dr I went on a multiple person tube ride at a water park and a girl that likes me places her vagina right on top of my foot and didn't say anything about it.

"That Louisiana operates under the Napoleonic Code. 

This myth was probably perpetuated by *A Streetcar Named Desire*, but Stanley's attempt to lecture his wife on the law is actually supposed to be a joke. Not only does Louisiana not use the Napoleonic Code, Stanley would not be entitled to his wife's inheritance under either the Napoleonic Code or Louisiana's Civil Code. The scene is supposed to show Stanley as ignorant, greedy, and arrogant. 

Edit: for clarification, Louisiana does use a civil code that was, when first written, similar to the Napoleonic Code. However, the Louisiana Civil Code was Louisiana's attempt to codify Spanish law, which was very similar at the time to French law; the Napoleonic Code was used as a starting point with tweaks to match the Spanish rules. 

This whole event arose from comical compromise. The US initially insisted that Louisiana adopt the Common Law; after arguing and begging, the territory got the US to agree to a Spanish law system (since that was the last foreign law in place before the territory was acquired by the US). Unfortunately, there weren't really any Spanish law books or sources in the area, and very few local could speak Spanish. They therefore relied on French texts which were readily available and which were fairly close to Spanish law; as noted, tweaks we're made as appropriate. 

This resulted in the Louisiana Civil Code. The code has been rewritten/updated several times, but the most recent revision has been more akin to piecemeal alteration rather than a total rewrite. It's a quite a nice legal system actually."

"I looked it up and it's much stranger than that. [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#Cognitive_abilities) it involved a famous ""fly problem.""

&gt;Two bicyclists start 20 miles apart and head toward each other, each going at a steady rate of 10 mph. At the same time a fly that travels at a steady 15 mph starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one, then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again, and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels. Question: what total distance did the fly cover? The slow way to find the answer is to calculate what distance the fly covers on the first, northbound, leg of the trip, then on the second, southbound, leg, then on the third, etc., etc., and, finally, to sum the infinite series so obtained. The quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start, so that the fly had just an hour for his travels; the answer must therefore be 15 miles. When the question was put to von Neumann, **he solved it in an instant, and thereby disappointed the questioner: ""Oh, you must have heard the trick before!"" ""What trick?"" asked von Neumann, ""All I did was sum the geometric series.**""

"The question itself is based on a flawed premise and cannot be answered in any meaningful way.

The brain is an infinitely complex network of 100,000,000,000+ neurons.  In other words, there are about as many neurons in your brain as there are humans who have ever lived.  Those neurons are connected to one another in 100,000,000,000,000+ (yes, that's 100 *trillion*) ways via immensely complex electrochemical transmission.  To say that we only ""use"" a certain amount of those neurons doesn't make sense, because it implies that it's possible for all of them to be ""lighting up"" at once (well, that can come close to happening, but it's called a grand mal seizure).  Furthermore, the number of neurons that are lighting up at any given time is not static.  Every single thing that happens in our body and mind is connected to neuronal activity, and there is constant change in what parts of the brain are active.  Finally, just because all of the neurons in a particular brain region are not lit up doesn't mean that we're not ""using"" that brain region.  It's not as if any of the individual components of the brain ever ""shut off.""  They're all constantly doing something, even when we're sleeping."

"&gt;In the past, the prevailing view on gray wolf packs was that they consisted of individuals vying with each other for dominance, with dominant gray wolves being referred to as the ""alpha"" male and female, and the subordinates as ""beta"" and ""omega"" wolves. This terminology was first used in 1947 by Rudolf Schenkel of the University of Basel, **who based his findings on researching the behavior of captive gray wolves.**[13] This view on gray wolf pack dynamics was later popularized by L. David Mech in his 1970 book The Wolf. **He formally disavowed this terminology in 1999, explaining that it was heavily based on the behavior of captive packs consisting of unrelated individuals,** an error reflecting the once prevailing view that wild pack formation occurred in winter among independent gray wolves. **Later research on wild gray wolves revealed that the pack is usually a family consisting of a breeding pair and its offspring of the previous 1–3 years.**[14]

"""Men are a lot more visual"" is this stupid myth that stems from a time where books like 'women are from venus, men are from mars' were popular and people just looked for post-hoc reasons to describe percieved gender differences.

Not that there's anything wrong with this kind of porn, but it shouldn't be a niche market to find some enjoyable porn (and that kind usually isn't free).

If 99% of porn consisted of female-oriented fantasies, directed by women, middle-aged women sitting on barely-out-of-highschool boys faces to get themselves off, boys slowly masturbating in front of cameras making seductive 'ooh' and 'aah' sounds, the scene always ending with a woman squirting over her bed partner's face/mouth and so forth... well, it would be hard for a guy to find something he liked enough to masturbate to."

I pray that this fine August morn finds you healthy and well.  What a pleasure it was to receive your inquiry! I shall attempt to apply the fullness of my wisdom and experience in a response.

Using various and sundry methods of shorthand, such as the aforementioned ""2017"", has provided me with vast reserves of extra time, which I use when I am in need of extra sleep, like a dragon resting upon a hoard of golden coins and other treasures too innumerable to mention in detail. My hoard of extra time not only supplies me with much needed rest, but also with peace of mind, as the slack in my schedule comes in very handy during busy times at work, when I need an extra hour or two to hire more coal miners, put down rebellions, duel scoundrels, and the like.

Sadly, I must now bring this missive to a close, as the demands of the day surround me like beggars with their hands out, waiting to be filled. 

Sincerely,

Captain M. Trousers, Esquire"

"I KNOW! I was too busy running to the car then noticed my mates eyes just staring. I was screaming  ""GET IN THE CAR"" but she wouldn't move. It wasn't till I turned around and saw him staring at us while smashing his head with the spade (we were builders and liked to bring our own trench spades). I feel like maybe he was hoping I would run back to him but I was terrified and just told my mate to hurry the hell up and quit watching him. "

Piggy backing on this comment as it was the same celebrity I ran into.  He was in Australia to film a movie recently.  Turns out he's a keen rock climber and was at the indoor rock climbing gym with me that day and I was having a chat to him about beta and climbs.  I had no idea who he was at the time until staff and other members pointed it out later on.  Nice guy.

"*Also*, marble chopping boards are particularly bad for your knives. So consider the fact that she probably tried to castrate him with a blunt knife, as a result of that marble chopping board. So that's a small win, right there. "

"It used the pipes to get around mostly, and it always struck in hallways that had their paintings slashed.

"I was talking to a guitarist in a band that does a lot of international touring. He says every time he gets a piece of gear, he has to buy 3 of them. One for his house, one for the US tour, and one for European tour. So there's a storage locker in Europe somewhere with the dude's entire tour rig, thousands and thousands of dollars worth of gear sitting in the dark waiting for those few weeks a year he tours Europe. And if between that time he decides he likes a new piece of gear, he has to buy it and have it shipped to somebody out there and incorporate it into his backup rig.

And I think that makes him even *more* unsettling because it shows *anyone* can descend into such a horrendous person."

"One problem with Christianity (and there are many) is how simplified it is when it's sold to other people. The real core concepts of the religion (love, faith, hope) can't be attained by just reading some words and attending worship every Sunday. Evangelical Christianity is one of the major reasons that people no longer attend church. 

When you think about it for just a few minutes, it *never* made sense to worship Jesus or God as individuals. That's boiling the entirety of the universe down to one thing. Does no one think of the Moses and the Golden Cow? It's spelled out very early on that putting all your attention onto one object is wrong. It's hard for people not to imagine God as an actual being that looks like a person instead of the entire universe. God said it Himself that he is the Alpha and Omega, beginning and end. He said ""I am who I am."" which in context meant that he is ALL. So imagining God as an old man with a beard is simple minded and deceiving. 

Once you consider that the entire universe is God's creation and God himself, then you realize that God isn't actually giving children cancer or keeping food from millions or allowing genocide to happen. God wanted people to stop worshiping little idols and realize that the entire universe is there to worship. The entire world is out there and humans have the opportunity to do with it what they like. Don't thank some golden calf or bearded man for all good things, just realize that it's the way the universe is working. 

With regards to Christianity, Jesus was sent to be an example of God's love for humans. It's less literally following behind Jesus and getting into heaven, and more following the example Jesus set and as an added benefit, you'll end up a good person. Jesus was nice to people, loved everyone, opened his mind and heart, and tried his best to be a really cool guy. Follow that example with an honest heart and you'll become a good person. 

The issue is that people are *literally* worshiping Jesus and God. It seems so absurd when you think about it. Too many instances of sacred objects, holy sites, and blind rituals that take away from the original intent of Jesus. People on the outside see a bunch of worshiping of idols and think ""what's the point? Just be a good person."" Exactly. That's exactly what Jesus wanted. Remember that God created the universe and that while you are in it, you should spread love. 

These are my thoughts on it. Christianity, as a religion, has plenty of issues that regular church goers don't want to acknowledge, but the original message of Jesus is pretty simple."

"I recently bought my first home. Every single day I get at least one piece of mail that looks like it's an official form I NEED to fill out and send back, with a check for some amount of money.

That shit should be downright illegal.

"I think the thing that stopped Joffrey from being as evil as Ramsay is that Joffrey had Tywin, Cersei, and to a lesser extent Tyrion keeping him in check. Cersei manipulated Joffrey out of a lot of what he wanted to do, and Tyrion and Tywin would stand up to Joffrey and call him out.

Keep in mind that Joffrey wanted to serve up Robb Stark's head to Sanza as dinner. He forced Sanza to look at the severed head of her father. The only thing that stopped Joffrey from raping Sanza as Ramsay did (in the show) was Margery requesting Joffrey's marriage and Tyrion saying ""you aren't touching my wife"".

If Joffrey had a ""parent"" like Roose, I think he would have done to Sanza what Ramsay did to Theon."

"There was/is a family in my town that I would've considered to be a ""perfect"" family (I'm going to refer to them as the ""Smiths""), the Smiths are a family of 6, and they truly are some of the nicest, and happiest looking people I have ever met; but a wave of misfortune and darkness took the Smith family by storm. Their second eldest daughter developed both depression and an eating disorder at the young age of around 14-15. Her condition initially didn't seem that severe, she was seeing psychiatric help and they thought she was getting better, but she was only getting worse.
Eventually her psychiatrist revealed to her parents that she said she had stopped eating at home, and would spit out meals when her parents were otherwise occupied. This self destructive behavior eventually led to her being taken to a hospital, where the doctors would try to make her eat via feeding tube, but at night she would rip her feeding tube out. She's recently been taken to a hospital in California (we're from a small midwestern town, so that's quite the distance.) And the worst part is; insurance doesn't cover any of it. She has spent multiple months in different hospitals and mental health facilities, and is in one of the top mental health hospitals in California. It's incredibly heartbreaking to see that this family has to suffer so much emotional and financial pain due to her unfortunate condition."

The constituency of Old Sarum for instance had only three voters so was very easy to win. And because in the House each MP's vote counted the same you could have an MP representing just 3 voters going head to head with an MP representing many thousands of voters.

"TL:DR someone sent Child porn to other students at my school with the same name as me.

Edit: seeming that people want the whole story, I'll make it. Can't do it right now though, maybe by this afternoon (Aus). Sorry!

Edit 2: So here it is, not the best story writing, never been asked to expand on one of my stories before.

Heading back about year from now, I was chilling at school. Going to classes, doing homework, getting assessments done early. All the good student stuff. Then suddenly, in my geography class, another student (X) comes over to me and says this to me: ""hey, umm, was that you on Facebook yesterday?""
I reply ""nah, I never use Facebook... what happened?"" I took him a little bit, but he received a message under my name. It goes ""Hey. Do you know what CP is?"" 
X replies with ""is it pokemon go?"" (Pokemon go was just recently released at the time) 

The imposter than responds to X with a link and a message ""this is what cp is."" X opens the link and it was to Child Porn.

At this point I'm shitting myself. Did someone hack me? Has someone got my details? Am I gonna get swatted?  I ask X if he has a picture/ link to the account.  I need to make sure it isn't mine. He didn't. He also deleted all the info from the person, so we could not report the person (X didn't want to get in trouble either).
So the night passes, I'm still shitting myself, and someone's sending child porn to a guy at my school. 

The next day, oh my, was bad. Another FIVE people from my school approach me saying the same stuff as X did the day before. Fuck. Luckily these people had kept th messages. I told them to all report the person, but I also looked at the account. It wasn't mine, but it was creepy. 

The imposters profile picture was normal. But boy, what was in his posted photos was weird. It wasn't CP, but there was a picture of a dog (presumably his). It was frothing at the mouth, teeth were pointy and its eyes were fully black. This was creepy shit. 

After seeing this. I'm heading straight to teachers at the school. I gotta notify them of a guy sending child porn under my name to other students. I tell them the story. They are pretty shocked. They say that they will do as much as they can to stop this. But I don't think anything really happened.

Another 3 or so guys got sent the CP. I got them to report and all that. And that was the end. Nothing bad really happened afterwards. I don't know if by chance this random person who had my name was sending CP to teenagers who happened to be at my school. Nor do I know if it was anyone attempting to get me expelled, or if other people outside my school got it. Nothing bad has come up over the past year from when it happened. Sorry for the anticlimactic ending :P

"Everyone learns about Dresden, don't they? 

Anyway, German bombers while trying to attack London docks hit some houses and streets. Churchill was pissed, so he sent 70 bombers over to Berlin but they accidentally bombed mostly fields and killed no one. 

Hitler was pissed and embarrassed having just had the war really make its way to Germany for the first time, and got on the radio to say:

&gt;""When the British air force drops two or three or four thousand kilograms of bombs, then we will in one night drop 150, 230, 300 or 400 thousand kilograms - we will raze their cities to the ground""

And so the bombings started. 

I guess if Hitler knew how good we were at blitzing German cities, he might not have been so gung ho.

"I feel like someone needs to say this: PLEASE DO NOT SELF MEDICATE ANTIBIOTICS!!! without professional guidance, you can be doing a lot more harm than good. 

1. If you are feeling sick, you might be positive that an antibiotic could help. You might be wrong. Chances are, you have no idea what organism inside you is causing illness. Even if you've felt this way before, and last time the doctor prescribed Augmentin, that does not mean it's the same thing. Example would be strep throat and mononucleosis. A lot of the symptoms are the same and without seeing a professional, you might think you have strep, which is streptococcus, a bacteria. Antibiotics can treat bacterial infections. They usually work by lysing the cell wall, puncturing it and killing the organism by either preventing cell division or causing all their insides to leak out. BUT if you have mononucleosis, known as mono, that's a virus, which is not treated by antibiotics. Virus cells don't work the same way as bacterial cells, and we don't have effective antibiotics for them the same way we do for bacterial infections. There is no pill for the common cold. So unless you know for SURE what you have, you may be taking the wrong thing. 


2. Taking antibiotics incorrectly can cause more harm than good. Have you ever read the warning on your bottle of amoxicillin or your z-pack box that says, ""continue to take this medication until it is gone"" or heard the pharmacist tell you ""do not stop taking this medication if you start to feel better""? Ever wonder why? A lot of people think it is somehow better to fight off illness naturally, without medication, and will only take a pill as a last resort. Which is fine, it's a respectable endeavor, but once it is determined that you need antibiotics and you start taking them, FINISH THE DOSE THAT WAS PRESCRIBED. The problem with starting a dose and then stopping once you feel better is that the medication isn't done killing off the entire infection. What you've just done is killed off enough of the infection to alleviate symptoms, but there are still some bacteria which survived. Can't you fight off the rest on your own? Surely your body's immune system can handle just a few, right? Most of them are gone. But the ones that are left are bacteria that have been exposed to mixed levels of that doxycycline you were prescribed. Meaning that the more susceptible cells died, leaving behind the ones strong enough to not be affected. They would have all died if you kept taking your meds, but now what you have is a small army of resistant bacteria. You've just aided natural selection in building a stronger illness inside of your own body, and since you start feeling better, you think that they are gone. These bacteria have the potential to multiply a lot more and cause a lot more problems than your initial symptoms. You've just given yourself a drug-resistant infection because you started to feel better. What if you buy fish antibiotics? How do you know how many to take? For how long? Which cell specifically are you treating? Is your infection gram positive or gram negative? Encapsulated? Acid fast? Spore-forming? Without professional guidance, you have no idea what you're trying to treat, what to take, for how long, or how much at once. Not enough, and you've got a drug resistant infection. Too much, or the wrong thing, and you could be destroying an entire ecosystem of resident flora inside your body that you need to keep you healthy. 


3. Unnecessarily taking antibiotics, or antibiotics being taken ""just in case"" for every sickness out there contributes to a larger picture drug resistance. The more we make antibiotics commonplace in the world, the more bacteria are out there that are getting more and more resilient against them. Multiple drug resistance is a very scary thing, especially if we run out of effective treatments before it catches up to us. It takes a lot of research, time, money, and testing, government approval, legal work, and education to make a new treatment available. People often call vancomycin the ""last resort"" drug for infections like methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. What happens when it fails? Another flesh-eating plague? This is hypothetical doomsday thinking, but it's lot more of a possibility than some people realize. There is a growing problem of antibiotic abuse which is leading to a global drug resistance. Doctors are partly to blame for this, trying to keep patients happy and not lose a customer. Hospital administration is partly to blame for this, having policies in place which may be contributing to drug resistant infections, and noncompliant patients are partly to blame for this, taking their antibiotics incorrectly, not finishing them, hording them and giving them to friends and relatives when they feel sick.

Too many people think that antibiotic drugs are a magical ""stop being sick"" pill that works for everything, and when you feel better, the job is done. That is simply not true, and even if you are aware of the dangers, it doesn't mean you have the experience or authorization to treat yourself with antibiotics. In short: DO NOT SELF MEDICATE ANTIBIOTICS because it is dangerous to you and everyone else.

The LA times interview source where he said the story ends after Return of the Jedi was from May 2008. The ""this is as close as you'll get to Episode VII"" quote was from when Red Tails was released in 2012, only a few months before Episode VII was announced.

"One of my best friend's ex wife, he and I  both had feelings for each other that we never told the other about until it was far to late to act on them, In all honesty I was pretty crushed when they got married but I never did or said anything to undermine the relationship I love him enough that to me the most important thing is that he is happy &amp; safe. We stopped talking for a while after they got married (later found out she banned him for speaking to me because she saw me as a threat). During that time she became physically and emotionally abusive, when we started talking again All I did was listen an be supportive for him. when he told me that he had been sleeping on a couch for over a year because he wasn't allowed to sleep in ""her bed"" I told him he needed to get out since he was the only one trying in the relationship. She boasted about cheating on him in there apartment in ""her bed"" &amp; did everything she could to try and make him look like the bad guy. She refused to sign or even be served the divorce papers until the sheriff served her at work&amp; even then refused the sign them. She destroyed all of his thing that were in their shared apartment left him with only his work cloths and what he had been wearing at the time. 6 months after they divorce finalized she tried to say she was pregnant with his kid (he hadn't touched her in almost 2 years because she wouldn't even sit on the couch next to him for the whole last year of the marriage let alone have sex with him) when he told her that wasn't possible she then went on a psychotic rant about how He &amp; I must have been having an affair,I had ruined her life it was all my fault that he even considered getting a divorce, I had poisoned their friends against her, she even tried to demand that my son have a DNA test to prove it wasn't his child, Mind you I live in in a different state then they do it's a 6 hour drive one way from my city to his, I am married and have been since before she met him &amp; I've never had sex with him.

&gt;Measuring the flatness of Kansas presented us with a greater challenge than measuring the flatness of the pancake. The state is so flat that the off-the-shelf software produced a flatness value for it of 1. This value was, as they say, too good to be true, so we did a more complex analysis, and after many hours of programming work, we were able to estimate that Kansas’s flatness is approximately 0.9997. That degree of flatness might be described, mathematically, as “damn flat.” "

"IMO. There's at least two different broad types. Working middle class and professionals.

Both have enough to save for retirement and no freak out about the car needing to go into the shop or paying braces for little bobby.

Upper middle class/professionals also have the luxury of tell the boss to fuck off when they are asked to do something dangerous/illegal/immoral without fear for their job, either through job security (union workers tend to have this sort of security) or because they can easily find employment elsewhere and have plenty of money for a rainy day. Also, professional organizations tend to have licenses and state boards and such.

Case in point: Oil workers are paid a lot, but when the driller says do something, you have to say how high. Versus a nurse maybe gets paid less, but if they see something wrong, they can speak up, and even if they get fired, there is plenty of other openings available to find another job at short notice."

"Another one most people don't know, only found out when someone arranged a fundraiser at the club I used to work at.

HfH has no Scottish operations whatsoever. All the money that is raised in Scotland (and likely other areas as well) never returns. 

Instead whatever money is spent to help ex-servicemen is concentrated in one or two areas - meaning that many go without as they are completely unable to travel 600+ miles round trip to get that help.

It stung a lot of people when they found out money they'd raised to 'help heroes in the local community' did no such thing.

"“The husband is expected to support his family and only in an emergency should a wife secure outside employment. Her place is in the home, to build the home into a heaven of delight.

“Numerous divorces can be traced directly to the day when the wife left the home and went out into the world into employment. Two incomes raise the standard of living beyond its norm. Two spouses working prevent the complete and proper home life, break into the family prayers, create an independence which is not cooperative, causes distortion, limits the family and frustrates the children already born. …

“… I beg of you, you who could and should be bearing and rearing a family: Wives, come home from the typewriter, the laundry, the nursing, come home from the factory, the café.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife, homemaker, mother—cooking meals, washing dishes, making beds for one’s precious husband and children.

“Come home, wives, to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives, to your children, born and unborn. Wrap the motherly cloak about you and unembarrassed help in a major role to create the bodies for the immortal souls who anxiously wait.

“When you have fully complemented your husband in home life and borne the children, growing up full of faith, integrity, responsibility and goodness, then you have achieved your accomplishments supreme, without peer, and you will be the envy through time and eternity” (fireside address in San Antonio, Texas, 27, 32–33).

"Oh, okay... Well, it started from going to play parties, over time you get to know people, there's certain folks you see regularly. Ten months, a year down the line, one of the ladies approaches me. Tells me she's been working as a pro domme. Says she's been watching me, she likes my style and thinks I'd be good at it. I go talk with her and her partner, and I give it a try. All goes well, and it's jam and tea for everyone.

It was all their clients to start with, but over time I had my regulars with a few singles here and there. Usually only 3-4 clients a week - I still kept my other job for the health insurance, etc.

It was interesting. It was fun. No regrets.

"Not going to go into details but I got rushed into emergency surgery. I lost consciousness just before hand. While out, I ""dreamt"" (for lack of a better term) I was in a very white area with white furniture talking with one of my best friends I ever had. We were sipping beers and shooting the shit and then he just said sorry**** (my name) it's not your time yet. I woke up in ICU and my first words were ""(insert his name here. Sorry for the ambiguity but I know people I haven't told would piece this together)"". I know I said this cause my parents and sister heard it. A week and a half later when my family left the Drs clued me in on what they hadn't told my family. My heart stopped beating and I had to be defibrillated 3 times. Once on the way into surgery and twice during. As a Christian, I had always believed in heaven but now I know it's there and I was on the edge of it looking in, just didn't know it at the time.

"Create a chain of gaming hotels.  Think gaming houses but on a bigger scale.  Like 4 or 5 floor hotels 100+ rooms.  Catered exclusively for gamers.  Sure would have all the regular amenities that most hotels would have like normal Lobby areas to hang out and chill in watch tv/binge netflix.   but also seperate areas like Console lobbies think massive LAN style areas 40+ sitting couch style with massive 64+ inch tvs everywhere.  PC LAN areas.  Including bring your own rig areas, or use ours areas.  In house kitchen stafff for all food/drink needs. Basically the idea is to create a place that would be safe haven for gamers in major areas to meet up at, hang out.  Can have extended stay rooms added as well for those that want to stay there longer (get out of parents basement before they move to the realworld kind of thing).  I love games, and I enjoy playing games with others.  Some of the best memories in my life has been going to conventions, LAN parties, basically places where no one judges you for your gaming nerdness, and you have so much common interest with those around you.  Having places like these were people could meet up at regularly, or just awesome hang out place like the old school lan centers.  But also as someone who travels for work, it would be cool to have these kind of places as options, where the wifi isnt shit, where after a long hard day at work, instead of mindlessly bar hopping all over the place, blow some steam off playing games, or whatever have you.  Anyways giant plans all built into my head, probably not super profitable. But eh if i were fully financially secure, this is what i would do, specially since I wouldnt worry if these things made a lot of money.  I just think it would be a semi unique experience."

"Non-compete agreements are traditionally unenforceable except for cases like you are selling your Italian restaurant and then open a new one across the street.

They would really have to give you something on top of your hourly wage specifically to lock you into a non-compete.  You could have a non-compete which would be enforceable which states ""while working here, you can't work at a Home Depot also"".

Don't ever let a non-compete scare you from leaving a job.

Found this online.

""Because non-compete agreements are so restrictive, they are often restricted or not enforceable. In California, non-competes are effectively illegal unless you are selling a business. Other states will enforce some provisions, usually the trade secret protection, but not the work restrictions.

The first thing to look at is whether there was some form of payment or consideration for the non-compete agreement. When the agreement is signed at the beginning of employment, courts will usually interpret the NCA to be part of the overall employment deal and find that there was some fair exchange for the agreement. But when an employer asks an employee to sign a non-compete agreement after starting employment and there is no extra payment or benefit to the employee for signing it, then almost all courts will invalidate the agreement for lack of consideration.

About one-third of states have some restriction on the enforceability of non-compete agreements because they interfere with a person’s basic ability to work and make a living. The restrictions usually limit the geographical area where the employee cannot work for a competitor and limit the time of the non-compete to less than two years. The employer has the burden of showing that any restriction is reasonable and necessary to protect against unfair competition."""

"Dude, when it's time to upgrade your phone, get a basic flip phone/brick phone. It will force you to limit your time on social media and pay attention to the world around you. 

I was in the same boat- glued to my phone 24/7. Then I threw it on the counter and shattered the screen. I had three months before I could get a new phone, so I went without a phone. The first week was detox and so difficult. I experienced straight up withdrawal symptoms for the first couple of weeks. It did get better. I learned to live life without a phone at all. 

Then after three months, I got a 2000's flip phone. I've had it for a year and a half and I love it for the most part. I did find, however, that my attention does go to my computer and tablet now, so I actively work on limiting that usage.

*A guard opens the door* 

It's been a year since PNWCoug42 and has family has been locked up.

Nothing happens. Only a strong odor filling the guards noses. The guards decide to take a peek in the room. But right before they get around the door post corner a man walks out, slowly. Coming at a halt in front of the guards, he stares down to the floor. The guards look at him for a couple of seconds, then at eachother. And back to the man, when they notice a trail of blood. They give eachother a frightened look. They slowly push the man aside to make way to take a look in the room. Without realising themself, they hold on to eachothers arms while shuffling into the room. One guard instantly throws up after seeing what happened in the corner. The other almost passes out and crumbles down. The smell is now unbearable. 

Scared of what's more to come, scared of getting killed themselves, they slowly turn aroun to the man, waiting to be slaugthered themselve as well. The man hasn't moved since. A guard asks ""Ar- Are you- Are they dea-, Did you kil- Wh- What happened?"" The man now for the first time lifts his head and makes a directional move with it. Aimed towards the table in the other corner. The two guards turn around again and what they then see... They gasp for air. Tears filling their eyes. A game of Monopoly. They know what happened all too well. One last time they look at eachother, longer than before. One guard now can not contain himself anymore and starts crying like a newborn. The other slowly goes and stand infront of the man. The guard gently nods.
He takes a step aside to make way for the man. 

Later that that night, PNWCoug42 comes home in an empty house. falling down in the chair. Still his head aimed down. Where his wife used to sit, now an empty space. On the right of his chair, the telephone. He needs to hear a voice. The game of Monopoly was 'over' after two montsh already after all.

On the otherside of the phone his mother in law picks up the phone. She realises the man doesn't speak. ""Are you there PNWCoug42? Hello? Everything allright? Is MrsPNWCoug42 with you?"". Silence.. ""Ok dont move my son, I'll come over"".

Right beforeshe is about to hang up, the man whispers but in a firm tone... ""Bring Monopoly""."

I work as a manager for a company that owns and manages parking ramps and lots. So where you go to park your car basically. Well I use to like five years back worked our night and weekend shifts (Thursday through Sunday : 4:30p to 4:30a) and to say the least, I've seen some shit. (Literal and figuratively)  
  
Well, at the beginning of my lovely time on the night shifts, I came across an especially charming young lady. As I was patrolling one of my lots, making sure no one was getting into trouble, I noticed between two cars, this lovely young lady, squatted... pants around her ankles, peeing all over the asphalt.  
  
Well, at this point I was unsure if I was really seeing this, and in my flabbergasted astonishment, I asked this charming young lady ""Really?"" and to my bewilderment she responded, boldly while locking eyes with me, as if to show her dominance ""Yeah. What are you going to do about it?!"" Now, at this point I was really taken aback. I've never dealt with a situation as such where I was having a struggle to maintain control of a situation with a woman squatting and urinating in front of me. Did she not understand the compromising position she was in? So, in response to her words, and lost of anything else to do... I took a single step forward, placed my hand on her forehead as if I was about to bless this child of god, and pushed her ass over into her own piss puddle.

"Spoilers if you care. 

They realeased Cursed Child, a play. For anyone who couldn't see the play, they released a script in the form of a beautiful little gold-bound book.

In it, Harry's son Albus is an emo shit who gets sorted into Slytherin. Draco Malfoy's son Scorpious becomes friends with him, and he is the only likable character in the entire thing. They find a time turner and decide to go back in time with this girl they met named Dolphin (that wasn't her actual name but it was Latin for dolphin) and stop Cedric Diggory from dying.

Because of this, he becomes an evil Death Eater, which causes Voldemort to win in an alternate realtity. The rest of the book is just the main 3 skipping through other alternate realities (one of which had Ron marrying Padma and having a son named panju, which made Hermione an angry single lady, and then they reconciled and then had their souls sucked out by dementors.) And the icing on the cake? Dolphin Girl is Voldemort's and Bellatrix's secret superpowered love child.

The only redeeming thing was that Hermione was Minister of Magic in the main timeline. Other than that, a confusing mess of a script. I hated it in every possible way. "

When she realizes I've been brought there to fuck her she freaks out at the guy, says she's told him before she won't do anyone else. I don't think she was a ""pro"" hooker, I think she just somehow got into this gig with this guy. Anyway I nope the fuck out of there while they're still going off at each other. "

The whole point is not that Phil has to be a good guy to get the girl of his dreams. It's that he has to learn to get involved. He involves himself with saving lives. He involves himself with people's heart break and weddings. He involves himself with a  homeless man's plight. He wins her over because he demonstrates that he's capable of acts and interests outside himself. 

So if the day and the people didn't continue on exactly as they always had and always would for the 24 hour loop, there would be no lesson for Phil to learn.  Everything that happens ""without"" him must always happen without him until it involves him. "

"I feel like it's probably bad that Autism Speaks doesn't have an people with autism on their board, and that so many people object to it. However, one thing that's always kind of confused me about criticism of AS is that it always comes from people with ASD leaning toward the asbergers side of the spectrum, rather than the more severe side. Most people have never met or seen someone with really severe autism, but my mom was a social worker who works with children  and adults with mental illness and other neurological conditions, so I have met a few severe cases before. It's not just not being able to communicate well or pick up social cues; severe cases are people who cannot communicate at all, who hurt themselves with repetitive motion, who are totally locked inside their own heads. Profoundly disabled. Obviously that's not most people with autism, but it is a lot. You never hear* those people's perspective on whether or not they would like a ""cure."" I feel a little weird about people whose conditions are much more mild presuming to speak for all people with Autism. 

But I don't really understand the full issue so maybe I'm missing something. "

"This. Seriously. I'm not being a dick, but to any redditors currently investigating Seattle; 

The price of living is now outrageous, and is on track to be completely fucking ridiculous within just a couple years. 

There is no middle class here. You're Tech and rich, or your broke and struggling. it's really, REALLY espensive here. 

Cost of housing for purchase is crazy as fuck. 

If the trend for housing (including cost of rent) continues the way it has, the city will be inhabitable only by the richest people around, or people willing to have housemates (usually, several). 

When the big quake hits, Seattle will be completely uninhabitable. LITERALLY. Most of the cities buildings are NOT rated to handle a quake even a fraction as powerful as the big one is supposed to be. There's going to be a huge loss of life, and Seattle itself will not be a city that is livable. i moved to a house (out of an apartment building), for this very reason. call me paranoid... but the fact that we're overdue for that quake is a serious situation no one is taking seriously. The government considers it to be the second biggest threat facing the united states right now. 

traffic is getting really, really shitty. 

waits/lines in every aspect of life. grocery stores, resteraunts, bars, costco, anywhere where you have to do an errand. The wait time for ""life"" is getting fucking stupid here. 

""why don't you move?"" 

I'm planning on it. Seattle is approaching the ""un-doable"" line where the cost of living will be so outrageous i'll be forced to move, which is heart breaking.

"Minnesota, fairly suburban-trending-urban as of the past couple decades.

Lot of towns with expansion room, you have the old parts of the city, with regular rectangle blocks, 40x120 foot lots, houses built in any number of styles between 1900 and 1980 or so, mature trees, within walking distance to the business center and what used to be the bus stop. And those generally show up on the market occasionally, between $100K and $200K, and get snapped up pretty quickly.

Then you've got, all of a sudden, developments, with ""artistically"" meandering streets, large lots, and a great big glob of new houses all the same age, all basically the same style, all blandly decorative in front and ugly as fuck on all the other sides and the garage, no trees of any size, no sense of privacy or enclosure unless you put up a fence, I don't know how everybody else feels about them but the design feels unfriendly to me, inside and out. And these, probably a fifth to a fourth of them are for sale, many of them foreclosures, at upwards of $250K, and they sit there.

Which is on the expensive side, or so it seems to me, for towns on the edge of the suburban/rural divide in Minnesota; the builders are now pushing ""executive homes"" in the $350-400K range, presumably on the grounds that these are different and better and you will totally be happier in one.

There are plenty of towns around here with a municipal pool (that being, I guess, the terminology in favor); either way there's a sort of sense of both community and openness, of welcome, in that. Municipal pools are friendly, in a way I feel like associating with a lower-middle-class or working-class sort of mentality---that's not too class conscious, but more concerned with having fun, and as such invests in something for the whole community to enjoy. Planned-community pools, on the other hand, feel distinctly upper-middle-class unfriendly, that sort of social-climbing chilliness that takes having someone to exclude as a perk of one's class. It's a select group investing in ""just us,"" which at the same time makes it harder for the rest of the town to get a municipal pool because one has a sizeable chunk of the population that's already got a pool and sees no need to waste ""their"" taxpayer money on it because ""we don't need that."""

"TL;DR: Trump supporter builds wall to separate us. 

This horrible old lady when I worked in accounting at an engineering company. It was a very laid back place, our supervisor was very chill, the whole atmosphere felt like a family. But this retch of a woman ruined the vibe anytime she walked in the room. Her and I got hired at the same time, she didn’t like anyone but I was her least favorite because the company she was with for 20 years replaced her with someone 40 years her junior so she just had it out for me, a twenty-some year old woman. 
There were 4 of us in the department, sharing one open-layout office. Her desk and mine were next to each other and she faced my side. She complained about the scent of my perfume. Okay, no problem, stop wearing it. But she still complained, to upper management, that I reeked like a perfume counter. Mind you, this lady chain smoked and she smelled like an ashtray. Whatever, they eventually told her to let it go. But she didn’t. She started complaining that I was distracting. What did she mean by that? She couldn’t even tell you why, but I was “just a big distraction.” This woman huffed anytime I said a word, answered my phone, if I glanced at my phone to change a song I was listening or whatever, she would run to my supervisor (who mind you sat 6 feet away from me) and tell her I was “Texting again” and to be like her and leave my phone in the car. 
When Trump started running and all of the BLM started up, she said something along the lines of “I hope he gets elected and we can start hanging those people again.” I have no idea how that didn’t get her fired, but the 4th person in our office was black and was not at all happy after that. 
Weeks pass and she is still huffing and puffing anytime I exist in her presence, she brings in upper management and starts (literally) crying about how distracting I am because I “won’t stop texting” and she can’t handle how distracting I am. The other 2 women in the office, supervisor being one of them, both swear up and down they do not see what she’s talking about. When management asked what needs to happen to resolve this, she says she wants a wall between us.
The next day they literally brought in a 7ft x 5ft partition and installed it between us. She was better after that, but still found things to complain about me for the next 2 years before I moved and quit due to another job opportunity. My supervisor called me back months later to tell me she and the other woman in the department were transferring out because the lady became worse."

"I'm an automotive technician. We don't make money on oil changes. We basically sell you the oil at cost, the filter at cost and the labor is so disgustingly discounted that it barely covers the cost of one of us to do it, I get paid 20minutes to do the work, even though it takes 45ish because of all the inspecting we have to do. But we have to do it that cheap to get people in the door to upsell other needed work, which is the real value to most people who don't know how thin is to thin on brakes, or what a loose tie-rod feels like.  But then again we are using the highest quality oil and filters, Im sure some shops use bargain basement stuff and charge full retail."

"""Thank you"" is what you would say to someone if they brought you a glass of water. Meera essentially went to hell and back for Bran, lost a brother and two friends for him, and allowed him to fulfil his ""destiny"" despite his whole plan seeming insane.

When you've been through that much trauma with someone, it's unnatural and a bit creepy not to want a fairly extensive debrief. Plus Bran seems utterly ungrateful to Meera after she pretty much ruined her life for him. She probably feels terrified that she's unable to gauge her relationships with people, and worried that her best friend (/crush?) has become a tree robot (which he then confirms)."

"Signed up just to say I was a part of that cult for 4 years, before getting out. Took me another 4 years to fully recover psychologically. It's also the first time I tell someone about it.

They call themselves Teachers' Group (or TG) and they own a whole bunch of organizations and run numerous ""humanitarian"" (haha, no) projects all around the world. In Denmark they mostly own schools and care-homes for children with special needs (not as noble as it sounds, please read on). Tvind is one of the schools, and Lindersvold, Hellebaek, Boserup, Skydebanegaard are a few examples of others. 

Humana People to People, a huge and well known chain of clothing stores in Eastern Europe, Russia and other nearby countries, is owned by them. Planet Aid in USA, as you have pointed out, is owned by them. UFF in Scandinavian countries and Central Europe is owned by them too. They have clothes collection containers all around the world and they sell those clothes in Eastern Europe, Africa, South America, China, using the majority of profits for their own well-being, despite claiming to do humanitarian work. Their own organizations in Africa (DAPP and ADPP are two of the largest ones) see almost none of the funds and they operate by finding partners among actually legit organizations. They have huge and luxurious center in Mexico where their top leaders hide from the Interpol. They even own a construction firm Faelleseje, plantations and farms in developing countries and some organizations and schools in the Caribbean (St. Vincent is one of the islands). 

Most people get dragged into their cult by joining their volunteering programs (DNS and DI in Denmark, CICD in USA). The programs are extremely poorly structured and consist mostly of working in one of the schools for free and fundraising money for you trip to Africa or South America. Young and passionate people, who want to make a difference and help others are being exploited with frequent cases of extreme exhaustion (up to 12 hours or more of unpaid work per day under a guise of ""training for Africa"") being a norm. Some of these people who wish good but lack proper skills and training are made to work with children with special needs, so their schools are full of ""staff members"" that lack qualifications. Young people are stripped of any privacy, are constantly brainwashed and subjected to extreme amounts of physical and mental pressure. Once a month everyone involved has to go to a ""building weekend"" to do construction work (unpaid, ofc). Once the ""training"" is over, if the TG members are satisfied with your obedience and conformity and if you manage to raise enough money (yeah, you have to work for them AND pay for that too!) by begging in the streets or otherwise, you may be allowed to go to an actual project in Africa. You may do some good there if you are up to that, but it will be your own work which you could have done without any organization or with a proper local one, as most of the TG projects are run by lazy, unqualified and underpaid individuals.

When you are back from Africa, you may be offered to join the TG, and that is where real brainwashing and indoctrination begins. You have to go through a ""TG camp"", where you do 2 things:

1. Do more unpaid work

2. Read the ""TG Bible"" or whatever it is called - a set of huge books on ""history"" written by TG members that know nothing about history. Here's a brief summary of the content: ""Communism - good! Capitalism - literally devil! TG - the only organization that's any good!"". 

You are fed cool stories about how great TG is and how much good they do for the world. Even though they mostly do good for themselves by escaping taxes and running ""humanitarian"" frauds. You are told that in TG you can do anything and take on any job you want, such as running a school. And to a certain degree that's true, and that's a problem, because you get more unqualified people doing jobs they shouldn't be allowed to do. 

The main principles of the TG cult are ""common time"", ""common economy"" and ""common"" something else that I forgot. They tell you it means that they all rely on each other and support each other all the time and get as much money as they need. What they actually mean is that you work 24/7 and you don't get paid. You have to make a plan for your monthly budget to get the funds that you ""need"". And they mean ""need"", like bare necessities. Every ""need"" of yours is closely examined and presented in a weekly meeting, where senior TG members decide whether your needs are legit. The rest of your salary (about 90%) is transferred to TG as a ""gift"" (you have to sign a contract and a consent for your bank account to be controlled by one of the TG members). It's constant control, constant pressure and constant exploitation. 

I'm sorry for such a long and poorly structured comment. I could go on and on about it. I could tell you how I got mixed up in that whole mess and how difficult it is to get out of it. If you are interested, I may come around to writing a full story. There's just so much to tell...

"You know that idea of an academic forum in a class where all the students are engaging each other in interesting debates about the subject? That. That is a horrible idea. In real life, it's just a bunch of idiots who don't know the material and are just loudly overcompensating for their lack of knowledge. Almost every single class I have ever been in, the teacher seems to believe that volume equals engagement. Nope. I just want to hear the lecture. I don't care what some retail worker's worst nightmare thinks about the subject. If you want to ask a serious question in class, go right ahead. If you're just talking to talk, don't. 

Example: There is a guy in my philosophy class right now who loudly comments on every new concept that's introduced and tries to relate it back to some sort of psychological concept. I'm guessing that's because he's a psych major. It'd be interesting if he had any understanding of what actual psychology is. He spent ten minutes the other day arguing about Realism having something to do with Object Permanence, while making it clear he had no idea what Object Permanence was.

"I never believed in the paranormal until a few years ago.  I was using an Ouija board with a few friends and it wasn't the first time I had ever used one.  In the past nothing ever happened, it was obvious that we were the ones moving the slider, and it was something that we used to make fun of each other.  But this time was different.  It was very different from the beginning, there was a strange feel in the room and something I had never felt before and haven't felt since.  When I took the slider I was moving it but it felt as if I wasn't alone.  The slider proceeded to move in ways I was not moving it, and after a few quick seconds it began to spell out the word ""Leave.""  I told my friends something was going on and they all thought I was kidding and trying to mess with them.  Then the slider, moving on its own now, spelt out ""now"" and we all were freaked out.  Before any of us could do anything a flowerpot in my friend's living room flies off its table about 4 feet and smashes to the ground.  We shuffle to put the board away and go outside and as we are going outside my friend screams and is claiming something hit him.  When we get outside, all freaked out at what just happened, he lifts up his shirt and realize a hand print on the center of his back.  I have never used an ouija board since and have never doubted the existence of the paranormal since that day."

"I heard the song ""Trouble"" by Shampoo in the original Power Rangers movie in 1995 and the chorus never really left my head for about 10 years. Even after that every once in a while I'd find myself humming it for no reason. It got to the point where I was half convinced it was me just making up random unrelated melodies and deja vu was tricking me into thinking they were the same thing. I was in my early 20s, at least 15 years later, when it was finally starting to fade, when I went on a hunt for it based on the one line I could remember (""Uh-oh! We're in trouble!"").  It took a while to find even with Google and Youtube.

It wasn't even worth it, it's a seriously terrible song."

"For personality, yes. Marshall is the caring husband any woman would want to marry. Lily is a manipulative and selfish woman who double-crosses her husband. 

But you know, Lily is **hot**. She is kind of a kinky girl who can do crazy stuff in a bar bathroom anytime and with anyone she wants. The show implies that multiple times.

Marshall on the other hand, let's face it, Lily is probably the hottest chick he can find. That's the whole point of the reacher-settler storyline."

"That's a very narrow definition of rape, one that leaves out a lot of situations. Rape is sexual activity without the consent of the other person. If someone is given drugs so they can't fight back, they were raped. If someone was asleep and sex wasn't discussed before, it was rape. If one of the people is underage, it's statutory rape, even if the underage person seemed to give consent. 

In situations of panic and fear, people react with flight, fight or freeze. If someone freezes before having sex with someone, is unable to stop them, they were raped. Saying they didn't fight enough, so it must have been consensual, is so damaging. 

In some cases, it may have been consensual. But in some cases, it clearly wasn't. A drunk person can't consent. Barney took advantage of women who were unable to defend themselves. He didn't care about consent. He didn't resort to violence or threats, but he did use manipulation and exploitation of weakness to get what he wanted. 

The fact that it's a comedy show makes it even scarier. For full disclosure, I was raped recently. My rapist and I watched HIMYM together, and we laughed at Barney together. When I was trying to figure out the day after the rape why I had showered 4 times and still not felt clean, I thought ""some people might have thought that was rape, but I know better."" I thought of moments and compared them to TV shows, and I assumed what happened was fine. Deep down though, I felt violated. I felt taken advantage of. I knew I was raped, but I couldn't admit it to myself for fear of being one of those dramatic, crazy girls. But it's shows like that that prevent victims of sexual assault and violence realize and admit what happened. 

I understand not wanting to say rape. I understand wanting to laugh at Barney. I just want to explain why I'm so bothered by the character, why I find that aspect of the show so troubling. I used to laugh at it all too. But now it's too real. Now, I look at the ""crazy"" women the group rolls their eyes at, and I just see confusion and pain. "

"That's just it. Joffrey toyed with the girls, making Ros beat the other one. Then he shot her with 3 crossbow bolts and killed her. That's all.

Ramsay beat Theon, skinned and flayed him, chopped off his fingers and toes and dick, knocked out his teeth, made him sleep with his bitches (*actual* bitches), and so much more. He not only denied him baths, he made Theon tremble at the thought of being more clean than his Master would deem worthy.

Maybe it's a question of age and nature vs nurture, maybe Joffrey would have turned out to be as bad as or on par with Ramsay. But when each of them died, Ramsay was much worse.

And to answer your question, no, I have no doubt that Joffrey would have found Ramsay hilarious. But he didn't meet Ramsay, nor did he get a chance to see Reek. Which means that Joffrey didn't get a chance to learn or think up what Ramsay (possibly) did."

"Oh boy, where do I start? It's hard to fully describe the scope of the deaf community in a single reddit comment but I'll try my best. 

The entire deaf community is centered around celebrating deafness. They're *proud* to be deaf and many members of the deaf community use their deafness to solely define themselves. Everything else that may define them is secondary to their deafness. They're not men. They're *deaf* men. They're not artists. They're *deaf* artists. They're not teachers. They're *deaf* teachers. You get the idea. 

They truly believe that they're not disabled. Some of them even consider hearing people disabled because ""they haven't been enlightened by the deaf community"". These people put themselves on a pedestal and glorify their disability. The deafer you are, the more highly regarded you are by the community. Anyone who has deaf parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents is treated like royalty. Third/fourth/fifth/etc generation deaf folks, if you will. They're untouchable and everyone must bow down at their feet. 

Many of the members in the deaf community remain tucked away from the real world. Some refuse to interact with hearing people. Some will only work jobs with other deaf people, hang out with other deaf people, and do deaf-related activities (deaf softball, for example). If the word ""deaf"" isn't a part of the job's, activity's, or group's title, they'll have nothing to do with it. 

I've always found the whole worshipping deafness thing super creepy, but whatever floats their boat, right?

Well, they don't think that way. They see anyone who dares to wear hearing devices, learn speech, and/or socialize with hearing people as traitors. I've been mercilessly bullied by the deaf community because I don't subscribe to their beliefs. I lead a ""normal"" life and they freaking hate me for it. They seem to believe that, since I was born with hearing loss, I must dedicate my entire life to celebrating and promoting my disability. There's so much more to me than my disability and I'm not going to let it hinder me, let alone take over my life. 

I've always thought the deaf community was a cult. I managed to escape the cult of deafness, and I'll always be proud of myself for that. 

It's cool that you're learning ASL! However, tread with caution around the deaf community because some of them will treat you with hostility (since you're not deaf like them). Don't let it get to you, though. Keep it up! All that being said, there are some cool deaf folks out there and the community seems to have become a bit more relaxed, but they still have a long way to go. "

When my uncle started another affair when his youngest kids (twins) were 11/12, one of the twins tried to commit suicide because he was so devastated by it. Also, his kid from his first marriage was a lot older, and ended up getting a girl pregnant and marrying her when they were teenagers. They had two kids total. When his youngest was 15/16, the wife started an affair with a doctor and got pregnant, and I don't know who the father ended up being.

The outside camera picks up him walking to the door and opening the doors (heavy doors, not automatic).  The inside camera picks up the doors opening but no one can be seen on the inside camera.  Neither camera picks up any video of him leaving.

"I have a similar story. Was working in an ice cream parlour when I was 16, on this particular day my mother was having liposuction and I was closing.

As ALWAYS people have this amazing ability to ignore all the closed signs, the lights being off and the staff ignoring them and still try to get us to serve them.

And this one dude really REALLY wanted a milk shake and kept bugging me even after I told him all the machines were turned off so because it'd only take a few minutes...solution?

Burst in tears and start sobbing: ""my mother has been in surgery all day and I don't know if she's alive or not. So I can make you your milk shake or I can finish my shift and find out if I still have a mother!""

"Funeral homes selling *pre-arrangements* for funerals to be held sometime in the future, many of which cost well over $10,000.

It's fine when it works out, for those that wish to pay for their funerals months or years in advance of the actual event.

However, consumers lose millions of dollars every year when ""pre-need"" funeral funds are misspent or misappropriated. A funeral provider could mishandle, mismanage or embezzle the funds. Some go out of business before the need for the pre-paid funeral arises. Others sell policies that are virtually worthless (see link below):

"It started out rough, but once the writers and actors got a good grip on the characters it became something pretty special.

'Sisters' is where they first found the heart. Most folks will point out 'Nevermore' as the point where the show really took off, but I'd argue that 'Masks' is the real turning point. Then 'Apprentice' happens and you realize ""Oh. This isn't just a kids show.""

Then Season 2 happens and it's just the best thing ever. The Terra Arc is fantastic, 'Fear Itself' and 'Date with Destiny' are amazing, and 'How Long is Forever' might well be one of the greatest Titans stories told, comics or otherwise.

Season 3 is rough. Cyborg's arc isn't as developed as it should be. You still get 'the Beast Within' and 'Haunted,' which are two of the best episodes of the entire series.

Season 4 is weird. Raven's arc is the darkest in the show and 'Birthmark' may well be the darkest episode of a cartoon I've ever seen. All the stand-alones don't mesh tonally with the rest of the show (but are pretty great for the most part.)

Season 5 was their attempt at a single season long plotline. It works for the most part and 'Go' (the episode, not the show) is pretty great. Most folks will tell you that 'Things Change' is bad, but that's just because it doesn't work as a series finale."

"Not surveillance but. I work in the oldest Theatre in Australia and we have a resident ghost, his name is Fred. Most people know of him, but a few of us have heard him.
One night upon closing I was turning out the lights and I heard a patron or staff member head up the stairs to the gallery seating area. So I stuck my head up the stairwell to yell out and tell them we were about to lock up. There was nobody there. 
As I went to close the door on my way out I heard them coming back down the stairs so I wandered back over to the stairwell to stick my head in and ask them to leave so I could lock up. Again, nobody there. Off I went out the door and round the front of the building to close the front gates. 
When walking past the front of the building I saw, clear as day, the silhouette of a man peering through the window above the door. 5 metres off the ground!! 
Needless to say I didn't go back in to check that time :D but I am very sure to say hello and goodbye to Fred now every time I enter or exit the building. "

"The British first invented concentration camps here in South Africa, and used them against the Boers.

The Anglo-Boer Wars were also the first modern recorded usage of guerrilla warfare if I'm not mistaken.

Two independent African countries (Botswana and Lesotho) voluntarily became part of the British Empire as protectorates because they did not want to be taken over by the white Trekboere moving north, plus there was the military threat from the eastern side (the Zulu Kingdom).

Many words in modern English have their origin in South Africa, such as trek, commando, veld, impala, etc."

Actually if he had pled either way he would have gotten a trial and a much speedier and more humane excution.  The reason he refused to plead either innocent or guilty is that by the laws that they were governed by they couldn't try him without a plea.  Dying before a trial prevented his estate from being seized by the town and allowed it to pass to his sons.

"One time I was standing on top of an 18 foot ladder (actually on the top of the ladder- not on a step, but on the flat apex part that says, ""DO NOT STEP""), and I accidentally cut into a live wire above my head. My intern unplugged it from the wall, so I could take down a hanging light fixture, and it turned out he unplugged the wrong one.

Dull wire cutters in my leatherman didn't completely sever it, so the electricity coursing through my hand and arm made the muscles lock down, and I couldn't let go of the tool, too. I don't know how I didn't fall.

When I told my mom about this, I said, ""and that's the closest I ever came to dying."" She said I came much closer, growing up, but was unaware of it."

"It's interesting that in the Declaration of Sentiments, which came out of the Seneca Falls Convention, it notes how men created the laws of divorce and that they gain full custody of children. But now, only 7% of children are placed in full custody of their fathers, while 80% are placed in full custody of their mothers (for the reasoning that mothers are better caregivers or for the sentiment of the mothers? Not quite sure the reasoning). I find it fascinating how it completely flipped in just over 100 years.

Edit: After checking my source, the statistics I pulled (7% fathers, 80% mothers) seems to be from the Canadian Department of Justice. But, in the US (because I talked specifically of the Seneca Falls Convention, which is US), from the US Census, the data is not that much different. 82% are placed in custody of their mothers and 17% are placed in custody of their fathers. It is important to note that the Census information was based on the Child Support Income received. It counted in parents that were not divorced (had children without marriage), and because of the information pertaining to child support income did not include percentage of parents who shared custody. So, it is not quite as representative of all custody cases as the information provided by the Canadian Department of Justice.

"Exactly, I don't like knowing 45k Americans die each year because we have privatized health insurance. You save a kid from a car accident and you're a hero. You fight to keep 45,000 kids, parents, siblings and people from dying of diabetes, and treatable conditions you get labelled a **DIRTY LIBRUL SCUM** trying to **TAKE** my money.  
  
I just don't want to know more people in my country die from a third world problem, than terrorist attacks globally. Plus it's cheaper anyways to have single payer via taxes than to have insurance premiums.  
I'm sure that'll start a debate, but with the proposed plan at a salary of 50k your insurance premium would be $91 a **month** with no copays, deductibles or any other bullshit that insurance tries to wiggle out of.  
  
I mean, I get that people like the ""freedom"" to choose, but what about the freedom to not die? Even if you have health insurance odds are it's shit tier compared to single payer in countries like Australia. Even if you get covered, you might randomly get a bill down the line.  
  
Insurance shouldn't exist in the health care industry. It's flawed. Insurance is the concept of taking a pool of money and calculating risk to estimate projected payouts based upon different conditions. You live near the water? Your flood insurance will be more because that's a higher risk. Obviously the insurance companies want to make a profit, their job isn't to provide health care. Their job is to pay providers for your health care. The problem is though, aside from anti-competitive environments of the pharmaceutical industry jacking prices up, with health insurance everyone needs to file a claim.  
  
With your house, maybe your house will flood. Odds are low you'll actually have it happen (depending on where you live) so the lower your odds the lower your premium. You need to go to the doctor once a year for a check up. Assuming you're 100% healthy and the most healthy person ever, that's at least one claim per year in that risk pool. You got diabetes or need pain medication? Each refill is a claim that the insurance will mitigate to reduce how much they have to pay out. Everything is a claim, and it just gets worse as you get older.  
  
Can you imagine how expensive car insurance would be if you had to go to an insurance approved mechanic each time, and everything for your car had to run through the insurance company? Want new tints? You have to file a claim with your insurance instead of just putting it on.  
  
Then on top of that, imagine if everyone got into an accident every year so they had to always file a claim? Or every year your house burned down so you had to file a claim? Obviously these are exaggerated examples, but this is one of many factors driving up health insurance premiums.  
  
People look at the problem and try to think of different ways to make the current model work. Competitive insurance markets, and that's great to lower premiums. My republican friends have great ideas to reduce premiums, but it ignores the glaring fact that insurance is a middle man between the health care provider and the recipient. A suit in CA somewhere is deciding whether or not you can really get that treatment rather than a doctor. This **is** a death panel. For 45,000 Americans per year this health insurance economy is a death panel. We need to stop thinking about which way we should turn the square peg to get it through the round hole, and just grab a different shape! Insurance for health care is a flawed concept."

"Burning and otherwise disrespecting flags.

I'm an American, and I generally believe the flag should be respected.  When it gets torn up, replace it.  Don't drag it along the ground.  But at the same time I understand that free speech is one of the most valued aspects of our society, and I think it's preposterous when people suggest that disrespecting a flag be criminalized.  The same people are usually fine with things like burning a Koran as symbolic speech, but absolutely fly into a rage at the suggestion that burning an American flag is exactly the same thing.

"Oh boy. Nearly 18M, Popped the cherry one summer ago, to a girl I was friends with through a folk dancing family camp. Hadn't seen her in several years prior to that because her step dad thought folk dancing, and most forms of artistic expression was for pansies that didn't know what a hard day's farmwork was, and was super reluctant to let her grandmother take her. He had also physically abused her and IMO induced her depression and personality issues. I anonymously reported him to the CPS not long after the camp was over, with help from my parents. I thought I was responsible when he was arrested until she told me she had separately reported him to local PD. She lives in another state, but we KIT and I know she didn't get better mentally after that, partly because her mother blamed her for step dad's arrest. 

I encouraged her to talk to other adults for help, and in helped her make the choice to leave home and move in with her grandmother one town over, in February. Her step dad had encouraged her to not apply to colleges, but she applied to was accepted into a single small arts college in Oklahoma with a late deadline, which she is very excited about. She has been much happier since the move; I even noticed she uses social media more and uses more exclamation points and smileys in our messages, haha. 

In two weeks, I will see her for the first time in person since last summer, at the artsy fartsy folk dancing camp again, and I get actual adrenaline rushes thinking about how close it is lol, and how different I imagine she'll be since I saw her twelve months ago.

"Really basic stuff. My first project was a set of cutting boards, simple and easy to make with the tools on hand. I have a Craigslist shop which I've invested about $1000 into, with a table saw, lathe, and drill press all found at good prices online. I bought a basic workbench and a planer on sale at Harbor Freight. Quite a few tools are hand-me-downs from my parents, all my clamps are from Craigslist. The nicest tool I own is a Stanley Sweetheart #4 plane which was a Christmas gift from my family. Everything else is cheap, cheap, cheap - but it does the job. My short-term project plans include a basic dust collector, a marking gauge, and table saw sleds. 

My journey started by discovering Matthias Wandel on YouTube four or five years ago. I religiously watched every single video he ever produced for years before I ever even set my hands on a tool. I then had the free time during my senior year at college to sign up for woodworking classes, and my professor, with whom I am still acquainted, is an amazing guy who constantly encourages me to make, make, make.

"Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911. Here's why: Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it. Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12. And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal. Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger? Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova. Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound. I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series: ""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1."" And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

"Survival in space unprotected is possible... 1965 study by researchers at the Brooks Air Force Base in Texas showed that dogs exposed to near vacuum—one three-hundred-eightieth of atmospheric pressure at sea level—for up to 90 seconds always survived. During their exposure, they were unconscious and paralyzed. Gas expelled from their bowels and stomachs caused simultaneous defecation, projectile vomiting and urination. They suffered massive seizures. Their tongues were often coated in ice and the dogs swelled to resemble ""an inflated goatskin bag,"" the authors wrote. But after slight re-pressurization the dogs shrank back down, began to breathe, and after 10 to 15 minutes at sea level pressure, they managed to walk, though it took a few more minutes for their apparent blindness to wear off."

And to be perfectly honest, while watching i felt that her being raped was completely out of place and was only added for shock value and to catch more attention due to having rape themes in it.

I felt like there was no reason to include that. It was not foreshadowed towards her in any way, it was just a bomb they dropped in there to make people shocked."

"This is a tough one. As a man approaching 40 whose just begun a new career, no wife and no kids, I constantly think about the decisions I've made in life and I constantly go back to my teen years. It was around that time I began to shut down, close out the world, and really started to pull away from myself. I've always had a talent for things and I now believe that I was a pretty bright and smart kid, but because of circumstances at the time I was never able to plow through low self-esteem, insecurity and a whole bevy of issues brought upon by my parents (who, let's say, were not the most encouraging people, but who provided for me nonetheless and I can't be too mad at them).

If I can talk to my 16-year old self I'd say, ""You need to understand that you can't make everyone happy. It's OK if people don't like you because you don't need to earn their validation in order to do the thing you enjoy doing. You're good at something and you can become better provided you're willing to deal with hardships, of any magnitude. You need to work hard and focus, instead of bailing at the first sign of outside resistance. Your parents will never truly understand what it is you do or how it makes you feel and that's OK because it's yours, not theirs. Or anyone else's. Follow your heart. Always. Because even though life will try to rip it from your chest, you should know deep down it can't because it yours. Don't be afraid, follow your gut and don't give up. 

Sometimes I wish I could wake up and be 16 again and correct all the bullshit that has happened to me over the past 20+ years, but I can't. Instead, I just try to live my life one day at a time. "

I don't recall him ever starting a conflict through malice but he's not above ending it that way. Granted the crossbow-toilet scene was probably his biggest deliberate act of violence but other than that it's always someone else attacking or betraying him, and him not willing to give them the satisfaction of beating him. It always seemed like an ego thing. Hell his motivation for his allegiance towards the end of DoD isn't for conquest or a throne or any kind of reward.

The things you point out are largely semantics, Cersei has more of a right because she actually has a relation to the lineage currently on the throne, has been involved in Westeros' politics, and would logically be the next in succession considering all other options are exhausted. The point is that she's killing lots of people for personal gain that for some reason she's entitled to? Seems like a bitch move."

"It's still having issues. Half of my family is autistic, and my nephew is going through ABA, which seems to be causing more issues than fixing. Based on what some therapists have told me, ABA only works for 1/3 of kids. For the rest, it either doesn't work or causes issues. I had it describe to me by one autist, it's like a shock collar for a dog. The dog will stop barking (the symptom) but doesn't know why (the cause) and might act out in other ways.

One of the problems is expecting and forcing 'normal' behavior, but not explaining what 'normal' is and why and when the behavior is expected. My sister asked the ABA therapist about explaining to my nephew what is expected (autists love rules and reasons!) and the therapist essentially said the kid didn't need to know, they'll learn the rules/reasons on their own. I personally think ABA would be better/more effective, if there were more explanations and rules that a kid could learn, rather than forced to do what (to them) may be randomly made to act a certain way (and random punishments for not doing so).

As we all know, there are good doctors and therapists and there are also less skilled and not as good doctors and therapists. Some can make ABA in a great tool, others can make life hell for an autist. We're still learning so much about the brain and autism that therapies are still being developed. 

Sorry for the wall of text, while not autistic myself, much of my family is, so this is a big thing for me. "

I mean the cities are whatever, cities everywhere are pretty much all the same, and people are people the world over and the food isn't too much different to what you can get in the rest of the world but the scenery is something entirely unique. Also anyone who lives on the west coast and hasn't been to Crater Lake I would really, really, really recommend it. It's actually stunningly beautiful, just... incredible.

"I'm not an expert, but I don't think any useful information came out of the experiments. 

I think the experiments are usually taught in college classes today for two reasons: 1) They demonstrate that social interaction is a basic need, not just for humans but for primates, and that a monkey who's never received positive attention won't give positive attention to her own children. This understanding carries over to our approach to human parenting and social work, although I think it was already understood from observing humans. 2) The experiments demonstrate just how disturbing some scientific research was before more stringent ethical standards were required."

"Did I say ""rules don't exist!""?

There are natural rules, and there are arbitrary ones. Natural grammatical rules apply in *every* dialect. When you say something in a given dialect which doesn't follow those natural rules, it's going to sound wrong. It may well get in the way of communication.

None of what I'm saying here suggests that language is whatever an individual wants it to be on any given day. 

The other side of this is that no dialect is ""better"" or ""more correct"" than any other. If there is a dialect in which those constructs are common and well-understood, then no...there is no problem with them *in that given dialect.*

Of course, that's not to say that you can just get through life on your idiolect and pretend that you won't be judged the way you speak. Regardless of the fact that there are no objectively ""best"" dialects, linguistic prejudice is very real and unfortunately must be accounted for. Most people do so without even thinking about it (see: code switching). "

"When I lost my high school friends. They all decided they didn't like me (I never got a reason for this) and instead of telling me they started to seclude me more and more. Only one of them stood out to tell me she didn't like me. She was step-sisters with the nicest girl in the friend group. 

The worst day of my life comes when I found out one of them was having a Birthday party and I wasn't invited. I'd considered these people my best friends since elementary and we were in high school at this point. I called up the one who was having a party on their home phone (this was over a decade ago) and they didn't answer. I left a voicemail and was audibly sobbing. I assume their mother heard the voicemail, took pity, and made him call me back instantly. When I asked why I wasn't invited, it was ""Well, because [other girl] doesnt like you and you know she's step sisters with B so i couldnt invite one and not the other. But if you still want to come, you can"". (I assume now this was also his mother guilting him into inviting me). Either way, I was ecstatic. I logged onto Gaia online and messaged another friend in the group to say I was going to the party. She responded with ""Nooooo don't go, nobody wants you there"".

My entire body tensed and I felt like I couldn't breathe. It was easily the most painful thing anyone has ever said to me to this day. I called the other guy back, said ""don't worry, I won't be there"", and cried until my legs gave out."

Since before he could talk though, whenever either would be all ""but you're going to make me sad, or cry"" or whatever bullshit, doing over-played voice to try to get him kiss or hug just like and when they want...  It's always enraged something in me, it's like trying to create a foundation for codependence..  I've always told him that he doesn't ever have to give people affection unless he wants and how he wants.  It seems to be working, he definitely is very sympathetic to others and compassionate, but when a person is trying to manipulate him by throwing those kinds of fits, he luckily doesn't seem to have any guilt or problem declining.

They didn't have time to break, so they'd be back on the trail the next day after giving birth.

Also, deliveries happened outside with little to no resources. There was one account of women setting up a makeshift tent in the midst of a torrential downpour, and while some women tended to the woman in labor, the others took to removing flood water by the bucketful.

Generally this is so that companies like Apple and Google can get students used to their ecosystem (MacOS and ChromeOS, respectively) and hopefully become loyal customers later on. An elementary school teacher I know enjoys it because he can do everything for his class over the computers, so his entire class uses virtually no paper.

They're generally fairly base models and can usually be obtained for anywhere between ~$200-$400/seat, which sounds like a lot, but usually classes will have a window that they use it in (so 25 laptops can be shared between ~100 students over the course of the day). The well-funded schools are the ones where each student gets a dedicated laptop, but again, a discount on a $200-$400 model.

Nonetheless, equipping an entire classroom with devices that cheap generally costs about as much as a set of books for that same classroom."
"That's what I meant by ""compensating for flaws in your speakers or something"", making up for the differences between the monitors they used when mixing and your earbuds/speakers/whatever. Of course you'll have to tweak it a little bit, but maybe I shouldn't have glossed over that. My overall point is that catagorically turning the bass down in your car for every track is definitely not that."
"It teaches them to problem solve and to work in the medical field. My general practitioner has told me before, ""i don't know where the pain is originating if it's not XYZ causing it,  I'll have to do some research, or send you to a specialist."" They aren't all knowing diagnosis machines. Their education teaches them good practices and the fundamentals. But they have to rely on their own abilities to problem solve when they're given something that doesn't fit the mold they encountered in school

In some cases the diagnosis is easy to find and administer aid or medicine. But because of the complexities and unknowns, they sometimes don't know. 

Anecdotal:  I've seen 2 specialists about a pain i have. They can tell me what ISN'T causing it. But no idea where the origin is. They're going through and checking off boxes. They're trained on how to figure out what's going on, but for the unknown they have to rely on their ability to problem solve and research. 

Even in the clinical field i work in, we have mountains of papers that explain what this drug does in the study. The doctor has to read it  (about 130 pages) and then use it as a reference for the study they're working within.  


If medicine was a language, they learn the vocab, grammar, and syntax in school. They then have to translate, create their own sentences, and speak it. "

"After he interviewed with my boss, he came by my desk and talked to me about my Starship Enterprise and Klingon Warbird that were hanging from my back cabinet and my Tardis bobblehead and Groot bobblehead that were by my computer. We talked about the different Comic Book Conventions we had been to, what costumes we had and what comics we liked. 

We talked like we had known each other for years and were old friends, it was so easy and effortless. A week later I saw the back of his car, he had a Transformer Decal, a Rebel Logo sticker and his license plate frame read ""My Other Ride is a Incom T-65"" and I knew then that I loved him."

"&gt; You're talking about high functioning autism, right? I work with autistic kids and I have a hard time seeing any advantages of not being able to talk, beating your own face to a pulp if you get upset about something, or not being able to focus on anything for more than a couple seconds. 
&gt; I don't like people acting like autistic people are less than human but I see people on reddit going way too far in the other direction; acting like it's just a personality quirk and shame on you for wanting to get rid of it.

Autism is both of these things. And there are a lot of people who would be called high functioning who would want to be cured if it was possible. I wouldn't want it personally, if I was cured would I still be me? It's been part of me my whole life and I've learned mostly to cope with it.  

But I can definitely understand that a lot of people would want to be cured. If you asked me 30 years ago I probably would have said yes as well.

"I think you're giving him too much agency, here. It's important to consider that he was consumed by the dark side at this point. He was no longer doing anything out of love, evidenced by him nearly choking Padme to death later. 

But even excluding that, you can't compare his love for Padme to any relationship he had for his step-family. 

If the dark side drove him to murder children and nearly kill his pregnant wife, there is no way there's any light in him that would cause him give any thought to the Owen family, who he hardly knew. 

It took 2 decades and his own son being seconds from death for him to do any kind of selfless act. "

"OK, lets start with assuming relative parity (which is what feminism seeks) between the sexes. And then we discard the assumption that it's always the woman that's the victim. 

Because that's what feminism is actually about - pointing out that women really are just as capable as men of _almost everything_.* 

That includes working for a living, programming, engineering, design...  but it also includes being a really awful person, who's abusive and mean spirited. 

By stopping assuming that women are feeble, frail and incapable you quickly see that in any dispute - both parties need to be considered as potential culprits. (And assume they might well be deceitful as well). Because women are just as capable of _that_ as well. 


\* Yes, I know this isn't _strictly_ true, but for normal life it's actually a solid approximation. Edge cases like olympic athletes really don't have a practical bearing on 'real world' scenarios, where there's a lot of overlap in terms of fitness, intellect, stamina and general capability, such that pretty much everyone is 'somewhere in the middle'.

"Love is:

- Wiping your SO's backside when they can't do it themselves, because they have a herniated disc.
- Picking them up from the airport at 3am on a cold, January morning in pouring rain because they just got back from a stag do abroad.
- You will have a blazing row with your SO. There is no ""if"", its a ""when"". Couples who have been together for 25 years in perfect harmony have blazing arguments out of the blue. You will say something to your SO that you will immediately regret.
- Love is nights when your both so horny, but so exhausted, that you start being intimate and you just end up falling asleep, or one of you will and you will be left horny and fed up. 
- Love is finding out your SO has lied to you after 10 years of marriage, and then forgiving them.
- Nothing is ""sacred"" any more. Whats yours is theirs and whats theirs is yours. 
- Dating each other is difficult, especially when you have kids and/or shitty shifts on your jobs. 
- Love is asking her what she fancies for dinner then realising you should never ask that question, and your in for an hour or two of prevaricating and gentle persuasion, and then giving up and asserting your dominance, which backfires spectacularly and you both end up going hungry out of spite. 
- When she doesnt want to go to the gym because she is a bit under the weather/hungover/fed up/tired/hungry and you have to be the bad guy and drag her, kicking and screaming and take all the abuse, because you know she needs it and breaking the habit will be bad for you both.
- Love is going to watch a terrible film at the cinema and tolerating it just enough so she doesnt call you a philistine and a film snob and get upset.
- Love is bailing her out of a shit night out with work mates at 10pm when you just sat down to watch Game of Thrones with a cold bottle of craft beer and a dirty fish and chips dinner.
- Love is when she lends you £20 from her betting winnings so you can get lunch at work because you forgot yours (its sitting on the side at home).
- Love is letting her drive the car when you are a terrible passenger, and keeping your mouth shut all the times she does something your not used to. 
- Love is not waking her up when you come in from a night out sloshed and just falling asleep on the couch or the spare bed.
- Love is never, ever, ever saying the word ""Divorce"", no matter how much she makes you want to say it, unless you absolutely, definitely know the love is gone. 
- Love is sacrificing your hobbies for hers when she wants to do them.
- Love is cooking her an awesome dinner and then not being upset when she doesn't like it all that much."

"Well, it took me ~15 strokes to cross the pool, so that's 1 breath per 7ish strokes. Usually it's one breath about halfway across the pool and one breath right before a flipturn. It's less uncomfortable than it sounds, especially when you're at an all out sprint. Coming off the wall (whether from a dive or a flipturn) the momentum is enough to power you pretty far with minimal effort. 

Mind you - this rule was for races, and mostly short distance races. She never would have told me I could only breathe 2x/lap if I were swimming the mile or a race where I'd need stamina. But when you're sprinting, every millisecond counts. Don't breathe unless you *need* to.

During practice we could breathe more and depending on the set length/difficulty I'd breathe every 3-5 strokes. Training to do the 2 breaths/lap just really takes time and practice. Also learning to breathe out fully while your face is in the water, so when you go to take a breath you can breathe in as much as possible. I wouldn't recommend trying to train yourself to do this unless you're planning on swimming competitively and have a good coach to guide you. Everyone's breath allotment was different based on height and wingspan. "

"Your funneling of all of these issues through ""misogyny"" and ""patriarchy"" is part of the problem.

Even when it comes to issues that clearly fuck over men, not women, they get categorized by feminists with labels that suggest that women are the victims (""misogyny"") and men are the aggressors/oppressors (""patriarchy"").

The assumption that men are violent, dangerous, and predatory toward women, which is the reason accusations are so readily believed by the general public even without any evidence, is not *misogyny*, for fuck's sake. It's misandry. Obviously!

This apparent desire to monopolize victimhood is a big part of the reason people, especially men victimized by women, get so frustrated with modern Feminism.   "

We tell him he's dumb, and he thinks that he just blinked and missed a switch. So he tried it two more times, and ended up losing all of the cash he brought with him to eat on the trip. We pulled him away from the game, called him an idiot but tried to help calm him down. A few minutes later, the guy who was running the scam approached us. He handed the kid back $50 (I think he'd lost $200 totally), told him to stop being a dumbass, and walked off."

Did Joel make the right call? I dunno. But you are going just as far in the opposite direction of ""there's zero reason to believe"" as the guy you responded to.

edit: also, you only murder a facility full of fireflies if you choose to. It's possible to make it through that stretch with as few as three kills: the first guard guy, the doctor, and the Firefly leader woman whose name I've utterly forgotten."

"I think we can just chalk it up to any dog can be shit sometimes. I love all breeds, but I've been attacked by a rat terrier and a cocker spaniel, my sister and uncle were attacked on separate occasions by a wolf-dog we raised since early puppyhood, and my parents were attacked by a rottweiler (I guess a history of dog attacks runs in the family; funny enough the rat terrier did the most damage). It doesn't always matter the breed or the upbringing; sometimes some dogs are just bad. My aunt has two akita mixes from same parents different litters, the older sister is the sweetest thing, while the little brother is a fucking terror (who now lives with a newborn human baby, which is not a great fucking idea). I know a dude with a pitbull who seems like the sweetest, most loving thing ever, and 99% of the time he is, but he also killed and ate a toy poodle. "
I think it would have been cooler if they had more time to flesh it out and continue with the conspiracy stuff in the show but I like the overall idea and it fits the most thematically with Firefly.

Probably the reason Japan managed to get ahead of the rest of Asia by early 20th century when imperialism was in full force and started taking over Asia, much like how Western Europe was able to gain an advantage over the rest of Europe/the world because they were the only ones untouched by the Mongols (because their leader died of an illness and had to go back to establish a new leader).

Also if you know the actual story it's not pleasant and enjoyable. My mom was a butthole and told me about the real Anastasia right after I watched it and taught me all about her family. Kind of ruins the fantastical romanticism that the cartoon version tries to show when you know they all died. 
What's worse is being so indoctrinated to that behaviour being what parents do that you didn't realise how she was the villain until later in the movie.

"This wasn't the case. The project had been delayed already and the next viable launch window was a way off, especially one that would be at a time when children were in the classroom to watch it. NASA was already under pressure to get the vehicle launched, but not for something so specific as the union address.

I did a lot of research on this as I had to write a report about the failures of NASA and Thiokol for university. Essentially management just wanted it done no matter the risk to save face, against the warnings from engineers about the dangers of O-ring corrosion. [Feynman's appendix F](https://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt) provides a summary of the failures if you're looking for quick and interesting read.

All-in-all I found it extremely interesting learning about what happened, and it's something that not enough people know about. NASA failed to correct the problems within their management structure, with the exact same causes to the Challenger disaster being the major contributing factors to the Columbia disaster. They refused to take responsibility and learned next to nothing from the Challenger disaster."

In fact, anyone who tries to downplay any of those three is flat-out wrong. You can ponder what-if scenarios with other allies such as the French, Australians or Canadians but if you remove American, Britain or Russia from the equation, there is no war won. "

"I'm a skeptic at heart but I swear I seen a UFO. I was about 18 and I had went to the movies with my then GF. We had just got back to my  place and we were standing on my back porch about to go inside. She looked up and said ""look a balloon!"". It was floating about a couple hundred feet in front of us and a little higher than a telephone pole. I thought it was weird how it kind of moved in an unnatural manner but it was a balloon so I didn't really second guess it. I don't know what kept us looking but it I'm glad we did. It started changing colors and moving in crazy linear patterns in all directions. At that point I knew it wasn't a balloon. It was originally a reddish orange  color but it started to change slowly and then rapidly. It went from orange to red to yellow and then disappeared. I never told anyone about it because I didnt want to sound crazy. I would've chalked it up to youthful ignorance but recently I've discovered a lot of videos of floating orbs and they look exactly like what I saw that night. Coincidentally I happened to live next to a major military contractor that was involved in a lot of classified projects. I'm not sure if it's related but I know what I saw that night. "

"There is a difference in believing in libertarian ideals - and believing you can actually implement all of them. Overall I want more personal freedom. So I advocate for things like:

* Universal Basic Income (Negative Income Tax) in place of the existing social safety net.
* Reduction of Malum Prohibitum Laws (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malum_prohibitum)
* Personal gun ownership
* Reduction of the militarization of police

Overall the left assumes that government is almost always more competent than individuals choosing for themselves - the traditional right underestimates the social costs of total freedom. The key is to preserve a free society, but also ensure that the playing field is level too.

I freely acknowledge that my ideal world is both impractical and unreachable - but thats the nature of compromise - if I achieve part of my goals, perhaps I can leave the world a better nicer place."

"That your average person can become a well-set millionaire by making videos of your day-to-day life, lipsyncing random popular songs, or by recording a few minutes of you screaming obscenities at a video game. 2007's YouTube was just a site where people uploaded random stuff just for shits and gigs or as a hobby. There was no such thing as sponsorships, let alone ad-revenue. Over the years, many success stories have come out of doing YouTube with a good amount of these people being set for life.

Also, what is defined as a ""popular video"" has changed drastically. Back then if a video pulled 100k views, it was viral. The most watched videos were usually music videos, and the *really* popular ones got between 1-3 million views. Now, the popular YouTubers easily get 1 million views a day, for some that number would even be considered poor. You also have music videos like Despacito reaching 3 BILLION views in less than a year, and most other mainstream songs easily pulling a billion views. It's still mind blowing to me how that video became so popular. "

Oh heck, maybe they'll do a timeskip, and then HBO can start up a second series of the lands that are left after the Big Bad happens.  Post-fantasy-apocalypse, as it were.

Uh, sorry for the weird, rambly response, I got inspired."

"I think a lot of people try to do this, but what I've seen happen over and over is someone trying their best to save but then circumstance stamps all over their attempt. 

You work your ass off to save money for insurance, but then a pipe bursts. You can't just ignore the issue, let your house flood, and not touch your hard earned savings - you've got to spend and fix it. Can't afford insurance now, which scuppers you next time something goes wrong. 

You work your ass off to save money for your work boots, but then the timing belt in your car goes, that's €250 down the drain or you won't be able to travel to work. Goodbye hard wearing expensive boots, hello cheap ones that I now can afford and need for work next week. 

You work your ass off saving to get building work done in your house, but then a family member comes down with an acute illness and you have to cover medical costs and the loss of income. Goodbye preemptive building work, hello extra costs down the line when shit goes wrong. 

Circumstance is the issue. Obviously budgeting for the long term is the aim, but budgeting well usually requires some amount of stability.

The drastic changes in tone just serve as refreshing variety, and shows that children can be more multidimensional than many adults give them credit for.

"

I once had a large black guy ( I'm a petite white female) walk past our house looking for his dog. He was pretty distressed and putting up flyers. I let him know if we saw the dog we'd find him and let him know.

Later that night when I got home (it was after sunset) I saw him still walking and looking. Being originally from a diverse area and often not as conscious of danger as I should be, I stopped my car (still running, lights on) and got out and walked toward him because all day I had been wishing I'd told him about our local Facebook lost and found animals group. Guy looked terrified. I tried to smile and be extra friendly bc his nervousness was freaking me out, and before I left he sort of let go and shook my hand and thanked me for the advice. 

It wasn't until later that night that I realized I was an idiot because I could have been making myself a huuuugely easy target. 

But the part that still hurts me to this day is realizing he probably thought his life could be in peril. Some tiny white girl who energetically approaches you after dark with an escape car ready is easily the first part of something that ends with him being framed, assaulted, or worse. It breaks my heart and I only hope that he found his dog because he seemed to love it a lot.

"In order to argue within science, you need to accept the [Scientic Method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method). If not, then it is not science and it is only personal belief.  I am fine with personal belief - just dont confuse it with science. 

Creationism is proposed as science so therefore needs a testable theory through scientific methods. As Creationism is based on proving that God created everything, you first need to prove, through scientific method, that that God exists.  

For the record, I am a Christian who believes in God and Jesus.  That belief though is not based on science and nor does it need to be. Evolution being true or false doesn't impact the existence of God. I believe if evolution is true, then it is because God created that way. 

The Bible itself is not scientific evidence. It is words written by people, albeit divinely inspired, that has been edited by humans over time. I believe it is the Word of God, but I know that the words chosen were expressed in narrow confines of what was available at the time, through the lense of the culture of the writer. Even ignoring those facts, using the Bible as evidence is in the realm of history and theology - not science.

Most of what I have seen in creationism argument is spent trying to prove the theory of evolution is wrong. It is done poorly and is based on the false assumption that if Evolution is disproved, Creationism is then proven. Science doesn't work that way. Disproving one theory doesn't automatically prove other - theories have to prove themself. (In contrast, proving theory A can disprove theory B if they conflict - which is where I assume the confusion comes in.)

So proponents of Creationism need to focus on following the scientific method and prove their theory without using the words of the Bible nor trying to disprove Evolution. I haven't seen much of that."

"Finally, an opportunity for me to post something worthwhile. Been on reddit for like 5 years between various accounts (none are banned, I just like changing names). I knew this day would come.  I'll give you a long list of great 2d games right now. All PC. Most of which can be played by pretty much any PC made after 2010 too, no GPU needed in most cases!

**Death Road to Canada** (Has couch co-op): A road trip game where you and your survivors try to make it Canada where it's too cold for the zombies to survive. You start with random survivors, and they will definitely die along the way. You'll meet new ones as you go. Decently fun game. Graphics are probably NES-SNES level. 


**Dungeons of Dredmor** A roguelike dungeon crawler. Start with certain skills. Unlock new ones as you go. You die, you're dead forever. Only things you unlock save. I admit, I don't particularly get myself why this game is so widely loved but with over 95% positive reviews on Steam I feel it's worth mentioning. 


**Enter the Gungeon** Another roguelike (One death = game over) where you try to make it to the final level of a dungeon using your guns and rolling out of the way of danger. A truly fantastic game. This one is coming out for consoles and Switch as well. 


**Lakeview Cabin Collection** A spoof on the classic slasher genre crossed with the adventure game genre. Think Maniac Mansion, except this one isn't point and click. You actually control the camp counselors. You need to avoid.. well, getting murdered. It's a puzzle adventure game. Personally, I suck at these games. I don't know why I keep buying them because I usually end up having to YouTube a walkthrough for every part. But this just tells me the puzzles are difficult, so if that's your thing, you'd love this. 

**Ruins of the Reckless** (Couch Co-Op) beat em up roguelike 

**LISA** A fantastic side scrolling RPG with a great story. You're the main character, a middle aged balding man named Brad with a terrible childhood. The world had some apocalyptic event, I believe a nuclear bomb. For whatever reason, there are no women left on earth. That is until you find Lisa. You raise her as your own until she gets kidnapped. There's your conflict, and the basis of the game: get Lisa back and out of the hands of the people who will almost certainly rape her repeatedly to save the species. Very Last of Us-esque in that regard, but this game doesn't take itself seriously at all, and it fits wonderfully with the game. 

**Nuclear Throne** Another 1 life lost = game over. This game will make you suck its dick repeatedly and you'll like it and ask for seconds. It's extremely challenging and extremely rewarding. 

**Project Zomboid** The greatest, most in depth zombie survival game ever created. I've had it for years and I still haven't figured out how to do a lot of stuff. Want to learn to be a carpenter? Find a book on carpentry and read it. But reading it will take about as long as it takes to read a real book (in game time, you can fast forward, but zombies will likely shatter your windows and come inside and attack you). You can stop reading at lets say page 145 and when you start reading again to finish it, you start from page 145 instead of starting over. 

**RimWorld** The greatest colony simulation game ever created. I've only got 23 hours in it and I still have no idea how to not have my people commit suicide, or die of disease, or just get butchered by rival colonies. It's awesome. 

**Scribblenauts Unmasked** This one is a children's game for sure, but it has every DC character ever that you can unlock the costumes and powers for. I enjoyed it just spawning heroes and villains and making them fight each other. 

**The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth** Probably the best roguelike I've ever played. 

**DISTRAINT** A side scrolling horror game. Very creepy. Although unfortunately a little short. 

**Fire Pro Wrestling World** You'll really only enjoy this if you like wrestling games. But if you do, you'll love it. The community workshop means every wrestler you could possibly imagine is available for download. 

**Hotline Miami** (Available on consoles too) A top down beat em up/shooter. Extremely difficult and extremely fun with a good story. 

**Mother Russia Bleeds** Virtually the same game as Streets of Rage just with a great story. Lots of fun. Local co-op too I believe. 

**Pixel Cup Soccer 2017** It's soccer. Don't know how else to explain this one. 

**Streets of Rogue** Another awesome roguelike with something like 20 different unique classes to unlock. A boatload of fun. 

**Don't Starve/Don't Starve Together** A survival game set in a world that looks like it was created by Tim Burton. Lots of fun. Just try not to starve. I wish they told you that in the tutorial. Took me weeks to figure that out. 

**Shank/Shank 2** Even though I think EA are a steaming pile of horse shit, these are pretty decent side scrollers. Available for console as well. 

**Terraria** It's like Minecraft, if Minecraft was a side scroller, and was good. There are bosses to fight, new levels of difficulty. 

**Starbound** It's like Terraria.. in space. 

**Pixel Shinobi: Nine Demons of Mamoru** Great side scrolling platform with stealth elements like flat out sneaking past enemies, or sneaking up on them and cutting their throats. Very challenging. Currently in early access and not complete, and the translations aren't great. But it's absolutely worth playing. 

That should really get anyone started on some great 2d games. That's all I can think of off the top of my head. "

"Absolutely this. I'm working on the 2nd draft of my 1st novel. I wrote the first draft as rough summaries, no dialog, just to lay the groundwork to a world and story. I did that for all 18 of my chapters. Now I'm going back and rewriting, working on the 2nd draft, which includes all the dialog and details. I write out the chapter, then I type it all up and edit it in Word. So by the time I've completed a chapters 2nd draft, I've now written it 3 times. 

That is how you build a detailed story. Layers on layers on layers. It may seem repetitive, but every time you rewrite, you either add things you hadn't thought of the first time around, or you'll get rid of things that once sounded good, but now feel out of place. Just keep at it. 

I've been writing my novel since September of last year. I finished my first draft around April of this year. I mostly wrote on my breaks at work because I don't have much free time and I'm kind of focused on raising my kids and doing housework.  "

"What a bullshit post. So its fine for her to violate peoples personal space and make other people uncomfortable with her attire? Theres a dress code for a reason, and being attractive doesn't give you carte blanche to violate it. I don't care if a chick is hot or not, I wouldn't appreciate seeing her tits and ass hanging out every damn day while I'm actually trying to do this thing called work. 

You are also most likely speaking from a double standard. If an attractive man was doing this to female coworkers and all up in their personal space you'd probably say hes sexually harassing his female coworkers(which he very probably is)

"An interesting theory I read the other day, in the context of how hunter gatherers still operate: Work is fulfilling, fun, and not toil when it meets these 4 things:

- varied tasks requiring high skill

- not too much of it (certainly not 8 hours. Closer to 4)

- a social element, doing it with others (sometimes)

- it being optional. If you don't feel like working today it's ok. Except mostly you do because work in this way is fulfilling and not soul destroying.

"It's also possible to incorporate a logical fallacy into an otherwise good argument (good for casual discussion on reddit at least, if not formal debate). Pointing out the fallacy doesn't mean you've defeated the core of their argument. 

Additionally, things like ""appeal to authority"" are contextual. It's not, for example, necessarily a fallacy to state the position of a large public health body in a discussion on medicine or something, yet I've seen people try to decry it as such.  

Honestly what pisses me off more than anything is people arguing disingenuously or just trying to ""score points"" or make minor quibbles. If you call Islamophobia racism *somebody* will smugly point out that ""Islam isn't a race so it's not racism"" and act as if they've ""won"". Ignoring the fact that some definitions of racism and common usage often include religion, *you know what they mean and you're deliberately missing the point*."

What is **A REAL SIGN OF ABUSE** is kids knowing more about sex than they should. There is no reason a 5 year old should know a lot about sex, it is not unusual for them to know the word ""penis"" or ""nipple"" but to say things like ""cock"" or ""pussy"" may be a sign of possible abuse. 

Also kids tend to be horrible secret keepers. If they say that someone did something, listen, it is amazing how often this is overlooked. **DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SAY WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS HAPPENING** you can plant the idea in their head, in addition it can be used as a defense that you unintentionally manipulated the child.

"I semi post about it every so often. But really, I don't know. I uh. I put up with it far longer than I should have. I have a scar on my arm from where she bit me. But basically, I planned on staying with her until I could get out. I'm going to use fake names here to get this to make sense. 

Devin was there for me through a messy divorce with my parents that left me homeless for a few weeks (I was 18 and living literally in the house but with no electricity, running water, gas, etc) for about two weeks (not as bad as some people have it. But growing up fairly privileged, it was tough). Especially as it was a particularly cold winter. Eventually when we had a place (with too many roommates) is when her true side shone through. 

Then this new girl showed up at work, definitely out of my league, I'll call her...Brittany? Well. Brittany had an identical sense of humour as me. And we just clicked. But as I felt so fully stuck in the relationship with Devin, I couldn't leave/cheat on her. Well. 

Brittany and I started hanging out, we'd go to a Shari's (late night Denny's/American diner open 24hours that's shitty and has pie) and I'd come home moderately late, deal with the abuse, and sleep, rinse, repeat. Brittany became one of the only friends I had left as my current friends wouldn't come around when Devin wasn't out spending what little money I had (I had to take leftovers from work to make sure we had enough food each day). 

Eventually Devin was suspect of Brittany, and she went and deleted the number of every female in my phone, even our mutual friends. Again more fighting, physical abuse, mental, emotional, some of the lovely psychological stuff too. It was great. 

Well, that forced me to memorize Brittany's number. Partly because I needed her number as she worked with me, and partly because she was he only person willing to listen to my abuse and keep it secret. I think I cried in front of her once too. I couldn't tell anyone as I feared my aunt (overprotective) might do something drastic. So Brittany was my only outlet. 

Eventually a bunch of employees went bowling and word got out that Brittany liked me. She was drunk so I offered to drive her home, despite home being forty-five minutes away. We get to her house, her huge dogs who hate strangers just adored me, and we went into her room. We made out, I didn't let it progress since I had a girlfriend, and I asked if we could resume when I was single. 

I then went and broke up with Devin. She insisted we work on things, I said no. She hurt herself, I said no. She threatened me, I said no. She moved out, and I asked Brittany if she wanted to hang out. 

One night I came home from work to find my house burglarized. No forced entry, in fact everything was locked up funnily enough. Cops didn't have enough evidence to go on, and my word of an ex possibly making a key isn't enough proof. So, my insurance kindly paid for 1/4th of my stuff, and that was that. Brittany and I dated for about a year and a half. She was amazing until she turned 21 and wanted to ride the carousel like her sister was. 

I was an emotional wreck dealing with the relationship with Devin and Brittany all in the same break up. It hurt. And substance abuse occurred. It felt like I went from being abused, to abusing myself. Eventually I made some productive changes in my life and became much more happy and emotionally stable. 

Moral of the story? I didn't really get out or deal with it until it was way late. I wish it wouldn't have happened, but I wouldn't be he man I am today if it hadn't. I learned so much, and what I've learned over the years is that I truly love learning. So much. That those women (and my most recent break-up) are some of the reasons that I drove to push myself back into school as a (then 25) 26 year old (not the oldest by far, but definitely not the youngest). Anyways. If you read this, thanks for taking the time. And if you didn't? I'll probably just edit this to make it disappear from the internet at some point. 

P.s. Devin also changed all my passwords too when we broke up. Now I use a password management app and I feel much more secure as I can give whoever I'm dating a Netflix password or something, and I can't feel any retaliation later. :) "

Does the distance part really matter that much?  They could already be stabbing people, running people over, bludgeoning them, poisoning them, strangling them, burning their homes down, blowing them up. People could toss bricks from their windows at crowds below and kill people.  There seems to be some assumption that gun ownership makes people more violent here, but wouldn't it be the same people you are already around who have the tools necessary to kill indiscriminately if they chose to?

To me, the thought of being defenseless is scarier than being around armed, rational people.  My 70 year old mom has a chance against a 22 year old thug even if they are both armed with guns.  Now give her a knife or a baseball bat as her only defense and how do you think that shifts the odds?  Firearms are the great equalizer.

My calculation looks like this:

* Pros: Can save my life or the life of a loved one against a threat we might have no chance of physically overpowering

* Cons: A bad guy can bring the odds up to a 50/50 if similarly armed."

"[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Diplomatic_Relations)

&gt;Article 22. The premises of a diplomatic mission, such as an embassy, are inviolable and **must not be entered by the host country except by permission of the head of the mission.** Furthermore, the host country must protect the mission from intrusion or damage. The host country must never search the premises, nor seize its documents or property. Article 30 extends this provision to the private residence of the diplomats.

For the most part thinking of it as sovereign territory of the nation staying there is helpful, but there are still exceptions. The host country can dictate how large the embassy staff is, or close the embassy for no reason. Though things like entering with out permission, arresting people on embassy grounds, or detaining embassy staff is a big no no.

Not necessarily. It's usually a dark greyish purple. When it comes into contact with oxygen it becomes oxymyoglobin which gives it the red color. When it loses oxygen, it starts to turn brown. Yeah they might still use dyes but not every store does it. The 4 I've worked in did not.

"Care about/respect/listen to your kids and put them first. 

My mother is like this (Narcissitic Personality Disorder). She only cares about herself and her wants/needs. I can't even recall the last time she hugged me, said 'I love you,' or apologized to me. She doesn't care about anything in my life unless she can use it to brag to someone else about how amazing her kid is. At the same time, she constantly criticizes me and tears me down over anything, yet can't handle any criticism toward herself (it causes injuries to her narcissism). She creates her own versions of reality where she will often try to convince you something did not happen (gaslighting) or that she is the actual victim. It makes you constantly doubt yourself, even spreading to other aspects of your life. Being around her is like psychological warfare. It's exhausting. I still can't tell if she does it on purpose to make herself feel better (narcissists have low self esteem so it makes them feel superior) or because she's mentally ill. But she continues to do it after I ask her to stop (even when I'm sobbing right in front of her), so I believe it is willful to some degree. There is a lot more to it, it's a pretty awful way to be raised as a child. I have a lot of mental scars because of it and suffer from anxiety/depression on a daily basis. The worst part is trying to explain it to someone and convince them that your own mother is abusive. 

I don't think you need to worry too much, most people are not like that. The fact that you are worried about being becoming someone like this to your kid gives me hope that you won't. People like my mom are not self-aware and often never bother trying to be (she will verbally/emotionally assault anyone who tells her there may be something wrong with her). Therapy is always an option if you feel you may be heading toward this route. "

""Thank you. Finally. Yes. They are indeed made out of meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years.""

""Omigod. So what does this meat have in mind?""

""First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the Universe, contact other sentiences, swap ideas and information. The usual.""

""We're supposed to talk to meat.""

""That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there. Anybody home.' That sort of thing.""

""They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?""
""Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat.""

""I thought you just told me they used radio.""

""They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat, it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat.""

""Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?""

""Officially or unofficially?""

""Both.""

""Officially, we are required to contact, welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in this quadrant of the Universe, without prejudice, fear or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing.""

""I was hoping you would say that.""

""It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?""

""I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say? 'Hello, meat. How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?""

""Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they can only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact.""

""So we just pretend there's no one home in the Universe.""

""That's it.""

""Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you probed? You're sure they won't remember?""

""They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them.""

""A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's dream.""

""And we marked the entire sector unoccupied.""

""Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others? Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?""

"Yeah, the trailers for that one definitely portrayed it as taking place in some visually stunning, creepy, ethereal, fantasy world (that was part of it, but not much)/never mentioned the Spanish civil war.

I never actually thought the movie itself was all that brutal tho...just a couple of parts were fairly graphic, and the worst one wasn't even shown/it was a shadow of a guy's face being caved in.  Plus by today's standards...I mean, I've seen more visceral violence on TV shows since that came out.  Opie dying in Sons of Anarchy comes to mind along with lots of stuff in breaking bad...The Following was also pretty fucked up, esp. the 1st season."
"&gt; If I treat an Asian person with more (more is different) respect than my white counterparts am I a racist? No, I would not necessarily be a racist.

You would be racist to white people because you would not be treating them with as much respect as those of a different race. 

Even positive discrimination (like giving a black person a job instead of a white person to fill a quota) is discrimination, because the result is that the white person didn't get that job because of the colour of their skin.

I might argue I am an ex racist, in the sense that, like an ex-smoker, I've learned to be aware of the thoughts as they arise, and learned not to act upon them.  I've learned to force my behavior into a pattern that goes against my childhood culture (never explicit or extreme in my family, but subtly ubiquitous in my society).

"I assume it would be the same all over the US, but at least in my state a lack of mental health information is considered protected. If you are not a patient and have never been a patient and the facility has no information or record of you then they are not allowed to disclose that information without your consent. That is the way it's always been explained to me and is why every facility will answer questions to unauthorized persons with ""I can neither confirm nor deny that_big_negro is a patient here."" The reason for this (as explained to me by mental health professionals) is that there are only so many clinics in a certain area. If a lack of information was not protected a person could simply call every mental health clinic and find the only one that refuses to give information. IE: If there are three clinics I can call all three, two said you aren't a patient, the third said they couldn't release information about whether or not I am a patient. It's not difficult to figure out from this that you're a patient at clinic three. now I can stalk that particular clinic and confront you or I could sign up at that clinic and try to poison the staff against you. Basically a confirmed lack of information is actually information, and your personal information is supposed to be protected. I think this doesn't apply to regular health, like if you were hit by a car people could call the local hospitals and find out if you are a patient there. Personal health information is still protected, they will say you are there but not why."

One day, I picked up the phone from one of the solar companies and went on a rant about how they'd chop down the trees that take in the C-O-2 (that's how I said it) and realize the oxygen that we as humans need to breathe. Then I ranted on about global warming and the ozone layer... the poor guy hung up. No more solar telemarketers at my house.

My mom was dying laughing and had to run to her bedroom so she could laugh, but she didn't want to miss a word of my rant. I think she thought it was hilarious in part because I rarely bring up global warming and didn't say carbon dioxide, but enunciated C-O-2."

It wasn't until I turned 13 that a developed an enlarged tongue and tiny, tiny lips that can only contract and expand with exorbitant amounts of effort (I got called ""booty lips"" in school, lol).

"Including Orcas. The ""killer whale"" is the largest of the dolphin family and are extremely intelligent. Blackfish opened my eyes to some things, but ~~a lot~~ way too much time watching other shows and documentaries and researching them is really really eye opening. 

Some of the things that cameras have caught dolphins and Orcas doing in the pretty recent past are astonishing. Shows that a lot of what we previously thought was singular events or instances are most likely common occurrences amongst their species. 

They have an incredible array of vocal abilities and while we cannot decode what they are saying, and science does not like to call it a language, it is becoming increasingly obvious that they do have their own language, and in fact, different dialects amongst different pods of whales. I think it was in 2014, there was a study in which scientists found that they could also learn and speak dolphin (bottlenose). This vocal learning is considered part of the foundations of ""language"", making it harder to continue refuting the idea that Orcas are incredibly intelligent and do have a ""language"".

There is a reason why we call them scientific *theories*. They are the best explanations we have for various things, and how well we ""objectively"" know something is simply never 100%.

However, the world is really complicated and always changing. If you're finding easy explanations, chances are you're not looking that hard.

"Here's how I quit smoking successfully - twice. Yes, twice. The first time I quit happily for 5 years but I made the one fatal error - never smoke again. I thought I was so over it that I could have a social cig every once in awhile but it's a slippery slope of nope. So I started smoking again for a few years but then quit again (using the same strategies below) and haven't smoked a cig in 9 years and have less than zero desire to do so again. 

What I did was, both times very similarly:

1. I decided. This wasn't a wishy washy thing. It was a very firm solid decision. The worst thing you can do is quit half heartedly and restart again over and over - you cement that process in your brain and you'll fail over and over. So Decide. If you don't feel strong enough to decide and stick to it, wait and try step #3 for awhile, or try #9

2. Plan the date of the quitting. Don't be stupid and make it right before a stressful thing or a social thing you know you will want to smoke for. I like to plan for *right* after that. The first time I decided it was New Years (I could smoke NYE and until I went to bed and then no more). The second time was after coming home from a big trip where I would be social and partying a lot. 

3. Propaganda. Between the period of deciding and the quitting date, keep smoking but force yourself to focus on all the bad parts. How much it stinks. How you have to go outside. How you feel coughing up a lung. How you are chained to these cigs. Don't get nostalgic about what you might miss, focus on everything you won't have to deal with anymore. 

4. Get support. Make sure the people around you will support your decision, no matter how much you may beg them later for a cig, for a drag, or just to be okay with you starting again. Make this decision, tell your friends, help them hold you accountable. When I quit the first time, I had 3 good friends and 2 of them smoked. They didn't quit but they never ever ever let me have a cig. They held me to my decision. It helped when I felt weak. You can also try quitting with someone else but if they fail don't let it be an excuse for you to follow the same path.

5. NEVER AGAIN. No cigs, never ever ever. Not even when you think you can handle it. And especially not as a reward for quitting for X amount of time. Obviously this is where I failed the first time. I learned my lesson.

6. Realistic expectations. Realize the first amount of time after quitting is the hardest, and plan. I didn't wholly avoid situations that would cause me to smoke as I knew I'd have to face them sometime and it felt easier to deal with all of that shit at once. Other people might find that tough situations are too hard to handle. Just listen to yourself and your resolve.

7. Find something to fill the time/distraction. This can help you when you first quit. When your mind wants to keep focusing on gimme a cig! try to find a way to short circuit and distract. This is going to be something personal you know works for you. It can be physical or mental or both. Do things outside your comfort zone like try a new sport or go visit a new place. Give your brain something to focus on. Even better if it's something new it has to take in or learn about.

8. You can do it. If you want to, and put your mind to it, you can quit. You can. Believing you can is probably the hardest battle of all. 

9. If you try and fail, that's also OK. Just don't do it over and over and over again without changing up your tactics. Try to use outside methods like gum, pills, vaping - just don't get stuck in those steps and just make them replacements for cigs. 

This is in no way meant to say this way is the only way to quit. Some people just literally decide in the moment, toss their cigs, quit and quit forever. But if you are looking for a strategy, I think this one helps. It certainly helped me."
"A few years back, I was 2 weeks after getting my wisdom teeth out and was still having pain. I had to stop in every few days, where they would change out these dressings in the sockets that had clove oil on them, which was really good for soothing the pain.

It was a beautiful, maybe 35 degree day in late October, so of course I took the motorcycle to get the dressings changed before hitting the freeway for my 50 mile commute to work.

The change was uneventful, but not too far after getting on the interstate I breathed wrong and ended up with a throat full of clove oil. It fucking sucked, and started an immediate coughing fit, the kind where your eyes are watering and you feel like you can't breathe. Only, because it was so cold out, my cough immediately fogged up my helmet visor. Being essentially blind, I popped open the visor to see where I was going, only to be hit by a 70mph blast of 35 degree air. The blast felt like it froze up the tears running down my face, and iced up part of the visor, but cleared enough of it that I could close it. But that was dumb too, since I was still coughing, so closing it blinded me again in a few seconds.

This went on for 2-3 more cycles before I finally got the coughing under control and proceeded along the rest of my uneventful ride."
"Because in order to become a good parent, you have to virtually divorce yourself from any and all selfish tendencies.  You become one with your child.  You literally live for them.  It is daunting, frightening, difficult, frustrating, exhausting, and seemingly permanent.  That's a lot to take on for anyone.  Some people aren't up for it.  Some people emotionally divest themselves but stick around because it's the right thing to do.  Some people bounce completely.  Some people engage completely.  Any father understands why another father might do that.  Many fathers could never imagine actually doing it though.  Because whatever negatives, challenges, and sacrifices are introduced into your life...these are outmatched by the flash of a smile when your child recognizes you.  Or the satisfaction derived from investing your time to mold a human being into a more perfect version of themselves.  

TL;DR Parenting sucks and is hard...worth it though."

And she takes her revenge in what feels like a more feminine way (as opposed to the revenge style of someone like The Bride from Kill Bill), which makes the fantasy extra delicious. "

I wasn't nearly as odd or inappropriate as a lot of what's detailed in this thread, but I got tabbed with the stigma of being a ""weird kid that always wore black"" in an immediately post-Columbine era. I said ""fuck it, I'll be weird then.""

I started dressing strangely (I owned wayyyy too much vinyl, velvet and velour for a teenage boy), I dyed my hair numerous colors... I wore tooth cap fangs with a top hat and Nintendo Power Glove. I did backflips down the halls, jumped off of school balconies, and I'd just do weird shit in general (one that stands out is I discovered my hair actually froze one winter after swim class, so I broke off pieces and handed it to people).

I wanted people to leave me the fuck alone. It worked. It.. Actually worked a little too well. I went from being a smallish nerdy guy all the jocks wanted to kick the shit out of, to someone everyone cleared the way for because nobody knew what crazy stunt I'd do next. I had my small circle of friends... But I completely ruined any chances I had of dating in high school, and when I decided to start getting involved in extra-curriculars my senior year nobody took me seriously."

2) working 30 to 40+ hours a week (on top of being a full time college student) at minimum wage jobs so we can afford to survive. My (separated) parents' families are in no position to help me out financially so I'm on my own

Red hair, sex drive like you would not believe. But she had no clue how to handler her self in bed. She would cry and moan at the slightest of touch. Total screamer.

She would blame me for her lack of orgasms. The only time she had one was the time we had sex drunk. Before anyone says it, we both decided well before the date to get drunk and then have sex and we had been dating a long time at this point. So no it was not rape. 

She was so relaxed that she had multiple orgasms and kept screaming the entire time. 

But remember when I said she did not know how to handle her stuff? She read in cosmo to douche after every time you have sex. Yup. 

She screwed up the PH in her vag so bad that she ended up with bacterial vaginosis. I tried telling her that things smell and taste very strange down there. But she only douched more becuase of it. I dumped her after one night when we got back into bed and the mere act of her being aroused cause the room to be filled with the pungent odor. It was so bad that the room smelled like that for 3 days. 

She went to a doctor and found out she had a severe case of BV and that she needed to stop douching immediately. "

"You make a good point here. My personal reading is that Anton's tendency to elevate his decisions to acts of random chance, acts of nature, are a sort of rhetorical movement in the film to suggest that there's something essential to the world about his violence. When Carla refuses to acknowledge that she challenges the essential and inevitable nature of that violence, essentially challenging the core of Chigurh's ideology. The car hitting him acts as a statement of ethos for the film - the man is human, he made his own choices, and in that way the inevitable, essential nature of his acts of violence is refuted. That's how I've always read it."

He's not just alive, but much much more dangerous in the books.  Where he allowed Ramsay an opportunity in the show to kill him (and his trueborn child), he actually has some straight up commentary of predicting Ramsay's betrayal.  He admits that Ramsay is a threat to him, and has plans to send him off into an impossible-to-win battle so that his son (as well as many innocent men) will get slaughtered.  

He's very much on par with Littlefinger in scheming- but I still think Littlefinger is more dangerous, if only because Roose would underestimate Littlefinger because of LF's low-born upbringing.  Roose has always used his lord-born resources for his ends, where LF wasn't raised with those resources at his disposal-and therefore he's learned to be much more resourceful with what he has."

I asked my parents why I was circumcised, the only response I ever got was because my father and grandfather were. Which by itself is a terrible answer.

It got even worse when the subject came up somehow with my coworkers, 3 of the guys admitted to be circumcised and fully intent on having their sons cut if they had any. And again, when I asked why they would do something like that, they just shrugged and said it'd be easier to have them cut than to explain why daddy looked different.

"&gt;In September 1940 the Polish soldier Witold Pilecki used faked identity documents to be arrested and sent to Auschwitz, which he planned to infiltrate and destroy from within. Boldly, Pilecki organized the opposition from within, hoping that one day friends from outside would liberate the camp. When no help from outside came he decided to flee and inform the world of the atrocities inside. He managed not only to flee but also to bring secret documents which he planned to use as proof, and even then he was not believed, as the stories seemed exaggerated. After the war he was arrested for treason and executed."

Same, but AFAIK most traditional hunts are followed up by very thorough butchering so nothing is wasted. I know some traditions involve thanking the spirit of the animal for its death. In general, I think small-scale hunting for food is essentially just a manifestation of our predatory nature. Plenty of other animals use tools to get their food, some dolphins are even known to engage in hunting for education or possibly pleasure. Industrial hunting is solidly artificial behavior though."

"The worst is when a professor assigns his own textbook. Making bank off of a captive market of students that have no choice but to buy the book.

This happened to me. The course was one of those core curriculum things that people only take to satisfy the requirement. It met once a week and the material was dead easy - seriously, nothing of value was taught the entire semester. The professor required you to buy his own textbook, which was short, very poorly written (there were grammatical mistakes), and cost....$100. 

Immediately I thought, there's no way I'm buying this thing for an easy A course. I literally did the whole course without the textbook. At one point we had to write a paper on any topic related to technology, so I wrote mine about how the textbook market was exploitative towards students, and even added a special section about professors assigning their own books, just for him.

Towards the exams the prof insisted there would be questions from the textbook readings, so I borrowed the book from a classmate and read how much I could. I swear there were like two questions on whole final (multiple choice, 50 questions), that you couldn't have answered without reading the book. It was all a giant scam. There were about 200 students in the class. At $100 a pop, this dude pockets thousands of dollars a semester, easy.   "

"If you want some tips on how to avoid this I can offer them. It seems like it bothers you but I'd like to encourage you to not be offended by it. We are trained to profile people for certain behavior or yes, appearances. You shouldn't take offense to it. It's not personal. There are many times that the person isn't stealing (thats why we don't go up and accuse them and instead we just try to be friendly and helpful). The issue is that there is a very large amount of shoplifters (more than you may realize on a daily basis. It's a real problem in some locations) and they ruin it for everyone.

Often times the people talking to you and doing this for reason B. don't even personally think you are stealing. There are some cowboy crusader types that are always on the search for that and if they suspect someone and communicate it to a manager (or if they are a manager themselves) many places require the store to work as a team to watch and ""assist"" the person. Even if the people participating don't agree with the suspicions.

South Africa has around 18% infected.  In Kenya it is around 5%; which is still high compared to most other countries (U.S. is only at 0.6%). HIV started in Africa and many of the countries are too poor to fight it effectively. The result is that HIV prevalence is way higher in Africa than it is elsewhere.

"This is existentially sad. In the macabre prisoner-of-the-corporatist sense. Your income is tied to a dead smile for the appeasement of a clueless overlord.

I think we have the concept for an 11 minute, sardonic adult swim show on our hands.

EDIT: Some may not know why this is so sad.

This is the necessary division of labor, a practice which propagates gaps in working knowledge for the purpose of efficient production. It also happens to be a great system for the extraction of profit from an enterprise, and particularly to prevent a worker from understanding and actualizing their own value to the enterprise. 


The function rests on hiding the value of work from its worker, who receives around a tenth of the value of finished work for, or productive contribution to, the enterprise as a whole. 

A given worker, for instance a graphic designer at Tech Inc., makes a tenth of the value of their work to the enterprise in the form of their compensation. *That graphic icon in the app is making a lot more money in perpetuity for Tech Inc. than the graphic designer was payed to produce it.* 

What's more, Tech Inc. can appropriate the icon any way they wish to increase the total value of the app, a valuable action which can increase the value of Tech Inc. shares in the medium to long run. 

Does the graphic designer ever see a kickback for how that icon was deployed in the company's secondary app? Maybe she gets a pat on the back and a promotion later to Head of Graphics and Icons, with a marginal raise! Probably not though. Maybe the graphic designer owns some shares! Probably not very many.

The contemporary tech corporation. The product designer does their part, passes it to the engineer, passes it to the marketer, passes it to sales. This process is managed for efficiency by a professional manager, who passes the excess productivity to their boss, the CEO, who passes it to their boss, the owner (a board of directors, representing major shareholders). Often in smaller enterprises those final three roles are combined in one or two people. To the top is funneled the productive value of the enterprise. This is the design of a corporation.

None of these roles, until the owner, see the full value of their labor in their income because of this siphoning. Not even managers. The managers are judged by their efficiency at extracting maximum value with minimum labor (managing workers). This is usually done by allocating capital (a printer, a computer, a server) effectively and by punishing idleness. 

The owner does not participate in labor for income, but instead trades money for more money by exploiting the productivity of her workers and managers, by paying them a fraction of the combined total value of their productive labor and capital allocation. This is the labor theory of value. 

Everyone is buzzing around to appease the owners, and sometimes get rewarded, **but never the full 100% of their true value to the enterprise**, because that would mean no extraction to the top in the form of profits.

Outside the office setting, we can replace the example with a barista, sandwich artist, assistant manager, janitor, mechanic, driver, teacher, assistant professor (schools today are run like business enterprises), etc etc etc up the entire strata from the precariat working class (sandwich artist) to the working petit bourgeois (middle manager). 

True managers like COOs or VP's often have partial ownership in the company, a strata above, where they benefit from the recycling of a portion of their own extracted value in the form of stock options and dividends, bonuses based on performance in extracting value to the true owners, and other alternative compensation. So maybe they recoup their theoretical share of the production value of an enterprise to 50% to the barista's perpetual 10%. These hotshots are the real middle class. They keep the whole party going.

To illustrate how production value is extracted to the top, let's take Lemonade Stand Inc. You would be hard pressed to find a *profitable*  enterprise that sold a thing at $1 per unit, when cost of sales, labor, and capital allocation totaled $1 per unit. The lemonade stand owners instead sell units of lemonade at $1.20 so that the owners may reinvest the excess in growing the enterprise and paying themselves, both long and short term. They will reinvest $0.15 of every unit of lemonade (long term investment, making money into more money) and pocket a $0.05 dividend from the unit profit (short term), which they may even reinvest into more shares if they're rich enough already.

Once you get high enough up the ladder of a corporation, the workers and managers are subordinate to a profit extracting class of what we call shareholders, successful entrepreneurs, directors, corporate officers, etc. They take many names and forms. Ultimately, they only know how to turn money into more money, and are good at employing managers, who only know how to manage production and are complicit in value extraction. 

This is the function of business ownership. This is the division of labor after all. They may be good people with varied interests and values. They're also extremely rich. The ones below them, designing, making, marketing, selling, accounting, **producing** things, are not in comparison. They receive a tenth of their total value to the enterprise as income, while the other 90% of their value is extracted and (almost) never returned. 

Why is that? Are the latter that much more stupid, or their contribution worth less, a tenth or half of their produced value for the enterprise? 

Maybe they started life with too little money to turn into more money. Maybe they aren't as good at managing a productive enterprise. Fine, they're not cut out to be good investors or managers. 

Those who produce should be rewarded in full for the value they create, at the end of the day, making money into more money. Such are the values of worker cooperatives and socialist enterprises. Invest in the value of the worker and share the gains accordingly. Quite different than investing in the value of the worker only to take the gains for the owners.

Be political at work. Actualize the value of your work. Fly in the face of bosses who pay you little to do work they do not do themselves. Work for people who pay you your true value, who know and understand your work. 

You can't do that by pandering to your clueless boss with a dead smile and an approving nod."

I've been yelled at as a manager because someone misspelled their name Matt instead of Mat on an order.  I've had my life threatened because we wouldn't serve raw sausage on a dish (illegal for a restaurant to do, mind you).  Rarely has someone flipped out because of miscounted change or a mistaken order, because most people are not assholes and don't jump down people's throats for common mistakes.  The people who yell are yelling over things that do not need to be flipped out over, because they are overgrown toddlers.  Normal, well adjusted people express their disappointment and request something be done to compensate for it.  Shitty people yell and scold.  No one should be abused the same way I've seen my employees be berated by other human beings in retail environments.
If you can tell me you've never made a mistake at your job, I don't think you should be so fucking condescending to people who do theirs.  Yeah, there are some unintelligent people who work in retail, but they don't deserve to be abused.

The Civil War. WW2. Vietnam. Korea. Put them all together and it's just a fraction of the losses France has suffered in one war alone. 

The US suffered protest and political uproar over the American troops killed in Vietnam. During WW1, France lost more troops in a single week than the US did in all of Vietnam. How do you think the public would react to those kinds of losses? "

"&gt;Had Germany continued to bomb airfields instead, the RAF would have broken, paving the way for an invasion.

*Citation needed*

The Luftwaffe in 1940 was incredibly ineffective in their attempts to disable the RAF, and more importantly Fighter Command. There wasn't a single moment where it looked as if the Germans were to gain air superiority because the RAF's ground situation no longer allowed them to fly. The RAF adapted to the bombings by the Germans, repaired airstrips pretty quickly and had more aircraft than the Germans to fight above Britain.

The original novel is filed with flawed characters that still have redeeming traits, including Frollo, who was a man of cloth actually! They split his original character into the bishop of Notre Dame (with white robes) and The Judge (wearing black robes). They're the same character roughly in the novel and I just have a lot of feelings about how well they made that rendition. Also; fuck Phoebus. "

"&gt; They were portrayed that way for a long time and recently they've been romanticized and made sexier, that book/movie shows how gross those sorts of people would be. 

I don't think that's a recent thing. Witches weren't always portrayed as ancient crones - one of the central parts of witchcraft *was* very much a sexual thing and one a lot of predominately younger women were actually executed for back during the medieval witch hunts. That being the accusation that they were having sexual intercourse with the literal devil. Keep in mind that historically witchcraft was an accusation often used against women who were different from the norm in some way, be it because they were knowledgable about the medical properties of herbs, because they were living alone and somewhat independent or because they were particularly promiscuous. Scorned lovers accusing a woman of witchcraft and claiming that she seduced them wasn't exactly an uncommon thing.

So, in essence, while the crone is certainly an aspect of traditional witchcraft, the seductress is another, just as common one. It's hard to overly sexualize witches, considering that in some way or another they already *are* very much a sexualized thing. "

The absence of light would lead me to believe it's not true spirit bending.

"This may seem weird, but I have noticed a pattern, mainly, in social media habits. I've had two friends in my life-time who turned out to be bipolar. You can tell exactly through their manner of social media use when the ""up"" time was, and when the ""down"" time was. When a person is constantly posting pictures of themselves, with friends, and going out, they're doing good. But a few weeks later, their feed turns into a weird art collage of quotes, paintings, and landscapes. Then they don't post for a month or two. And then they're back again. Social media use (for women) is often paralleled with their emotional well-being. 

Additionally, people who tend to have short-lasting ""obsessions."" They lose weight for 6 months and are all about being ""fit,"" before you know it they gain 20-40 pounds and retreat to their beds more than they should, and avoid seeing people because they are embarrassed. These obsessions can also be certain interests such as photography, a certain friend group, even a type of substance. People who aren't sure of themselves jump around each corner, and often struggle with finding balance. It's all or nothing."

I made vows to that woman, and she made them right back. The day she told me that she didn't want to be my wife anymore is a day I will never forget. How could you do that to somebody? We had a baby. We had a career. The whole world ahead of us. All you had to do was love me the way that I loved you, like you said you would. Like you promised.

He understands commands and greetings in three languages. 

He has learned how to open doors. 

He learned to fake being injured after he was actually injured and he got more treats than normal. When he wants a treat, he'll start limping out of nowhere, and once he's told ""no"" a few times, he goes back to walking like normal.

When we go to the vet, he jumps up and sits in a chair like a human. 

If he's really tired, he won't respond to basic greetings or anything, but if I say something like, ""you know, you could help me clean this up if you wanted to"" as a joke, he'll let out a big sigh. It's like he either can't be bothered with the request, or he's frustrated because he understands the concept of *not* understanding those particular words.

So many! The one that stands out the most is when my daughter and I heard pounding coming from our basement door and I thought it was my husband who locked himself out (we had a lock on the basement door) so I opened the door and no one was there and no one was in the basement. I called my husband who assured me it wasn't him but he was close to home. I took my daughter and barricaded ourselves in our bedroom til my husband came home and searched the basement. There was no one there. I didn't call the police because we'd already heard lots of strange noises in the house and there was never anyone there. We'd also hear my daughter's old toys going off on their own in the basement.

"TL;DR Be civil with the carts and everyone has a good time. Be a dick and expect issues.

Let me explain this properly, I push carts for a living. 

IF there are plenty of carts in the usual car area, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY don't leave a shitty pile of carts blocking the good rows. I don't mind if you put them back correctly but there is only so much space for carts there.

IF there is even the slightest chance you can't carry all your goods, please just take the cart into the lot and put it in a corral after. Honestly, I'd rather my extra carts be in the corral than wildly flung all over the sidewalk.

IF you take your cart into the lot, please don't be that asshat who leaves the cart next to their car when the corral is 15ft away. Does not compute.

If you see the corral overflowing, you can still add your cart to it carefully. We don't ask that you sort out the mess that other make but you will get a cheery wave and a heartfelt thank you if you do.

This is the worst one: MY CORRALS ARE NOT A BOWLING ALLY. DO NOT TRY TO SHOOT CARTS INTO THEM FROM 50FT AWAY. You're making a mess, the carts end up blocking up the corrals, and I WILL yell STRIKE or GUTTERBALL at you if I see you do it. This happens WAY more than most folks think.

If you leave your cart next to your car and I come to get it before you leave, understand that you need to pay penance by letting me get the cart and not attempt vehicular homicide. I'm trying to help so don't peel out cause your embarrassed that I had to pickup your cart specifically.

Please remove the trash from your cart. I get it, a large iced coffee with 12 pumps of caramel is too much for you but there are trash cans EVERYWHERE. There's no excuse for that. I don't mind receipts or even empty bags but stop leaving coffee cups and other nasty spoilable things in the cart."

"Ryan was the one who formed the band and wrote most of the songs on the first two albums. But then there were creative differences and they wanted to split ways. Ryan took Jon (who was not an original member, but hired to replace the first bassist) with him. 

In any other universe, Ryan would have kept the band name. But the record company technically owned Panic, as they were contractually obligated to release more albums, so it was pretty much 'whoever decides to stay with the record company's vision of the band gets the name', and it was Brendon and Spencer. 

And I'm super glad, because Ryan and Jon tried out a couple projects but faded into obscurity, and Brendon Urie is still in a position to make music that gets heard, thank goodness. He is a musical genius. "

"Went to get a few teeth filled. Wouldn't freeze, was in agony. Dentist kept calling me a liar and telling me to stop whining. Said I needed 2 root canals. Told him I couldn't afford it and to leave them alone and just fill the other teeth he was working on. He started to root those two teeth anyways, then got made at me when I told him to stop because I was in so much pain. Finally had to get up, walk out and get my mother to come in to tell the guy to back the fuck off. He ""patched"" the teeth with temporary fillings which fell out 2 days later and I left. 

Was still in so much pain, saw my family doctor (who is also a surgeon), who asked for the xrays the dentist took. I managed to get them and the doc saw that the reason I was in so much pain was my teeth in the maxilla (upper right area) were infected so badly it was *actually visible on the xrays*. So I had a choice, the doctor could drill a hole above the teeth to let the infection drain, or he could just pull the 2 teeth the dentist started to work on. I chose to lose the teeth. Turned out it wasn't much of a loss, when the doctor removed them they shattered to bits, and would never have been able to be fixed from the get go. The doc said that the dentist should never had touched me, if he had an ounce of intelligence he would have seen the massive infection on the damn xrays. It was so bad it was going into my eye socket, and could have blinded or even killed me. Doc put me on a bunch of medications for the infection afterwards.

The asshole dentist had put me through all that torture and charged me over a grand for the ""work"" he did. Thankfully my doc pretty much *saved my life*. "

"Which is a bullshit accusation and completely inaccurate to the issues with SGK. The vast majority of their money goes towards ""program expenses"" which essentially means the charitable part of a charity. Only 8% of their revenue goes towards admin costs, which is pretty average. 82% goes to program expenses and the rest goes towards fundraising. Program expenses are split into 3 major areas for SGK. 45% goes towards Education, which basically means awareness and things like that. 33% goes towards screenings and treatment, and 22% goes towards grants (cancer research). 

There is no evidence they are pocketing most of the money, and that isn't even a claim anyone reputable is making. Their margins are well within an acceptable range and  similar to most charities. 

There are reasons to hate them, but the idea that they are keeping people's money isn't one of them. They are litigious against people using their ""brand"", they've used cancer causing materials in promotional water bottles, they cut support for Planned Parenthood, they focus more on awareness than research (as shown above, but the money is still going towards helping, not towards speed boats and mansions), their old ceo was over compensated for the size of the charity (but again their overall admin costs were within reason). 

Reddit is a game of broke telephone and this stuff about SGK had passed around this site for years and been so distorted from the truth. I don't think people should donate to them, but I also think people should know the real reason and not a distorted sound bite. "

This is not hard to believe considering how far video games have come in the last 30 years. In that case, there would be millions of these ""video game consoles"" around the planet/universe.

2. Humans never were able to create these simulations. Which means that eventually we will die out in some huge disaster. "

The jedi shown killed by the clone troopers were either experienced knights or masters, so Anakin wasn't needed to kill all the younglings and jedi at the jedi temple.  For as much dramatic emphasis was placed on Anakin's betrayal it really didn't have that much of an impact on the Jedi as a whole."

"Can't agree - it's definitely a science argument there too. Some people get sick from eating the wrong foods, or not eating the right ones. This goes both ways - some people are like cats, getting very ill without certain proteins only available in meat, and others get ill from eating the same proteins. 

The science part of the argument here should be that it's unscientific to lump everyone under the same diet as 'good' or 'bad'. If you're Asian, you're far more likely to be lactose intolerant, for example, though it's not universal.

Vegans and sworn carnivores both have it wrong. There is no right diet for everyone; there is only a right diet for *you*. It goes further; some people are more flexible in their dietary needs, meaning the have choices others don't but assume everyone else has the same flexibility of choice. Which another wrong path when discussing what people should eat.

If you *are* eating meat, then sourcing matters a lot for those ethical reasons you mentioned. But forcing everyone to be vegan for those ethical reasons is not only overkill (pun intended), but likely to make more than a few people very ill."

"Remind her she's more than a mom. 

I am exclusively breastfeeding, and i felt like i was nothing more than a pair of boobs. It hurt, it was hard, i was leaking everywhere, i was trying to figure out how to....well, keep this baby alive. My son cluster-fed, so even going to pee left him screaming. I was attatched 24/7 for a few weeks and i was tired, in pain, and lost. I went from super active to being stuck on a couch or in bed all day.

I told my husband we made a mistake, that all i was ever going to be again was a pair of boobs. My son didnt love me, he loved these engorged, bruised, heavy sacks of fat on my chest that i HATED (went from an A to a DD). 

He told me three things:

1. You are more than boobs. You're an amazing wife, daughter, niece, granddaughter, and cousin and you're a great mom. 

2. If you want to BF, don't stop on a bad day. But if you still don't want to when he's latched better and relaxed, we'll go get formula and i'll take over at night. 

3. This is not forever. I know it feels like it, but you're new, i'm new, and he's new. We'll all get used to each other and it will get easier. 

And it did. The first month was a shit show, the second was a little better, and so on. Every hour, minute, second gets you closer to ""better"". The colic doesn't last forever, the tears don't last forever. Remind her that she is still the person you fell in love with, and be patient with her.

"&gt;That's why we need the feminism

A) you don't need feminism to treat everyone the same

B) often it's prominent feminist organizations and speakers who oppose repealing the dunlth model (men arrested in every DV situation)

&gt;Do you think the men in the office would accept a 5% pay cut so the women could have a 5% pay rise and bring them to parity? What if that number was bigger? What if it was the 20% or so that official figures suggest? Are you prepared to take a pay cut in the interest of equality? And if you are... how confident are you thateveryonewould be?

Do you think that feminists would accept a 50% decrease in domestic violence funding that goes to women's services so men can get some DV services too?"
"Domestic violence occurs in pretty equal numbers in both men and women. In most abusive relationships, both partners perpetuate abuse, when it's not reciprocal, it slants slightly towards female abusers. Though, women suffer more severe physical trauma then men, on average.

This has been known since the '70s, but feminists have tried to cover up this research by various bullying tactics (also detailed in the paper, also the most interesting read, pages 8-14). "

"Bruh, every story reminds me of my actual relationship. :(

Edit: Thank you all for your kind replies and your concern, I've decided to tell you a little more about my relationship, if anyone is interested. My girlfriend and I started living together after 6 months of dating. Since the day I met her I thought she was an amazing person, I loved her sense of humour, I loved how she singed to me, I loved playing videogames with her and we had many things in common. But since the day we started living together I realized she was very very conflictive. 

I wont go too much into details, but since the day we started living together I think we've argued at least once a week. I may also be a little conflictive at times, but I've worked so hard to make the relationship less aggresive or toxic. On the other hand, she has always done her best to do damage. I have lost many friends and stopped doing things that made me happy since we are together. Since then, I feel I've become increasingly embittered and each time I get more and more angry or sad for less and less important things.

I've tried so many times to break up with her, but she always threatens with killing or harming herself, or running away to another city with ""friends"" she barely knows because ""it's the only option she has"". Meanwhile I can't leave my own house because I have nowhere to go. I always end up accepting she stays because I'm worried about her well-being. She has done a lot of emotional damage to me, but I do notice little improvements in her behavior sometimes. Perhaps I'm stupid for beleiving she will change, but I want to give her that opportunity. I think we all deserve the opportunity to prove we can be better, I just don't know how long will I endure this relationship."

"A Boy Scout Outing when I was fourteen took a strange twist halfway through. My patrol (7-8 other kids of similiar age) were on a hike in Olympic National Park. We hiked in Friday afternoon and after several miles, we got to the campsite. One setup camp later, a fifteen year old comes from the opposite way we had hiked. He asked for just one thing, a refill on water. He takes his now filled water bottle and leaves in the direction he came. That's it, from then on we have a good time hiking.

Naturally, we have questions later about why a teenager would be alone, and several miles, if not 20+ from the trailhead at which he started. A parent asked a forest ranger if there were any permits (which are required to camp there), and the answer was no. There was also no other cars (you could tell because the entrances to the park are monitored).

There were a lot of questions left unanswered that day, and the boy quickly became a ghost story in my troop. I'll come back and add more detail later, but it's 2 am and I need sleep."

"""Breakfast is the most important meal of the day""

You don't need to eat breakfast, the problem with studies saying it's important is because the studies have seen those who don't eat breakfast tend to have less healthy choices when eating.

Of course these same studies say ""less chance of being obese"". Again slight bias from studies as they have noticed those that eat breakfast eat healthier. Eating breakfast doesn't ""jump start"" your metabolism for the day.

If you skip breakfast, just eating healthier throughout the day. Just because you skipped Breakfast does not give you the right to get a Big Mac with Large Fries and Coke for lunch and dinner."

"Former fat guy who used to weigh 320 lbs (weigh 200-ish now).  

Fat people generally DO try to change their diet and exercise, the problem is they do it wrong. People aren't fat because they have a solid understanding of proper nutrition and effective exercise.  So they end up making dietary changes, but not good dietary changes. For example, changing from regular foods to ""Fat Free"" and ""Lite"" foods that are usually worse.

Something someone who has never been fat can't understand is how muddy the waters are when trying to lose weight.  It's easy to get confused with all the supplements and products used by people in good shape or with all the ""diet"" products.

The history of [attempted assassinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_assassination_attempts_and_plots) of American presidents shows that virtually all were committed by lone gunman, and in Oswald's case he could not have planned it and it was clearly a crime of opportunity.

&gt;Perper, best known for conducting the autopsy on Anna Nicole Smith (ruled the result of ""acute combined drug intoxication""), also reveals that Murphy's pneumonia may have been the result of drug use.

Pneumonia is a possible side-effect of heroin abuse: http://www.narconon.org/drug-abuse/effects-of-heroin.html.

"Probably me. I went full goth in high school. I had read the Sandman recently and decided to dress like Delirium. (Crazy mishmash of vintage clothing over hand made fishnet shirts, hair dyed a bunch of colors, and my main jacket was this huge purple trench coat.) 

I was really into Vampire the Madquerade and wore my clan Malkavian pin with everything. 

I got into MMOs before they were really a thing and spent countless hours on Ultima Online when that sort of thing was still a super niche market. I was into computers when the internet was still pretty new, and was majorly surprised at how much pushback I got for that being a girl at the time. I really wanted to take a beggining coding class at my high school and was told I couldn't because I'd be taking a seat from a boy who might actually need to learn computers for future jobs. 

I did my best to never ever speak to anyone, because people loved playing the ""I'll pretend to be nice to you and then make fun of you for thinking I was being nice to you for real"" game, and I was NEVER able to tell if kind words were genuine or if they were a trap, so I decided complete silence at all times wasthe way to go. 

I rarely paid attention in class and usually brought a book to read during classes. I'd just sit there and read whatever while the class went on around me. Since I wasn't hurting anyone, teachers never called me on it. Despite this, I made solid B's through most of high school, except I literally failed gym class twice.

I ate lunch alone for four straight years. No one ever invited me to join them, not once. 

Because I was so isolated, I spent a ton of time with my dog and was known for always bringing my dog with me places outside of school, and had taught him a bunch of neat tricks and agility stuff. (He was a sheltie, they like that sort of thing.) because of this, my peers decided on ""dog fucker"" as the go to insult. 

I grew up to be a commercial artist for tv and film. My life isn't super stable and I haven't really done any of the major life milestone stuff, and I'm still single. But I've done some really cool things and have a ton of good stories and had a bunch of adventures. "

I arrived within 7 minutes, to find her up to her shoulders in this muddy swampy stuff. I threw her the rope, told her to hold on for dear life, and I pulled with everything in me.

"Totally agree, I hated Jack way more than Hannibal, it's true. He manipulated Will constantly and put him in harms way for ""the greater good"" even when Will repeatedly tried to find a way out. 

Hannibal's crazy, but what's Jack's excuse? He was in a position of authority and used it to abuse his agents. 

I feel like S3 Hannibal came to realize that he actually cared for Will as a person and an equal (as much as he's able, at least) whereas S1 and S2 Hannibal (up until the realization in the S2 finale at least) was mostly just Hannibal toying with Will. 

Honestly by the series finale I was secretly hoping for a confirmed murder husbands ending just because it would have served Jack right if Will went full psycho, the guy had been put through so much shit by people meant to help him. And Hannibal's gaslighting and manipulations but professed care probably painted him as a far better option. "

He saw a lot of horrific events bit despite that he was the most friendly guy I'd met, didn't speak very good English and was also very naive because he was still very new to the US. Anyway, my FF smoked a lot of weed at Z's place, even when he wasn't there at the time. Once when that happened, the landlord unexpectedly walking in on him, catching him. Over the next few weeks I'd notice police sitting on the street in front of Z's place. Not too later, my FF was making THC candy at Z's. The next day, when my FF wasn't there, the police busted down the door and arrested Z, still in possession of the weed candy. He was charged with production of a controlled substance and is now sitting in jail. Considering he was still so new to the country, I doubt that he knew what FF was doing anything illegal. He was a very nice guy and his life is now ruined. My FF hasn't spoken Z's name since.

I always thought this kid seemed like a bit of a fruitcake, but that skinny upper-middle white kid was apparently obsessed with black johnson's smacking him in the face.

The pickle is you can never face your customer again if you're the one who tells him his kid wants black balls on his chin.  So, I called their house and had his mom put him on the phone.  After he assured me nobody else was there, I unhid the screen and told him my gift to him today was that I would not tell his parents what I found and that it was for him to clean that out and move the family pics back.

"Jessica Jones villain.  Anything he told you to do, you had to do, and you couldn't do anything else.  He had this power his whole life and thus never faced adversity or rejection, so he was extremely immature and never developed any character.  If he didn't get his way, he would immediately and horribly ruin you in some way.  Sometimes death, sometimes not.

To make up an example, let's say you work in a coffee shop.  Kilgrave shows up and orders.  You make his coffee and then tell him how much it costs.  He tells you he doesn't have to pay, so you shut the cash drawer.  Then he decides his coffee doesn't taste good, so he tells you to put your face in the boiler pot, which you immediately do and scald your face off.  If someone tries to stop you from doing it, you push them down and scream at them, fighting until you manage to successfully put your face in boiling water.

"My boyfriend and I got tipsy at a bar and went to go see Despicable Me in theaters. It was a later showing so there weren't many people there. This is a Movie Tavern, very fancy on the inside, the waiters serve you at your seat and the menu contains expensive dishes. So everyone is expected to be on their best behavior. By this point, I'm quite drunk and as my last few drinks began to creep through my system. He orders me a chocolate milkshake, my favorite. I'm sipping away and suddenly, 20 minutes into the movie, I start feeling sick. I go to the bathroom and vomit. Then, thinking everything is okay, I go outside to the theater's balcony area and sit down to smoke a cigarette. About 3 drags into it, I vomit again, pretty aggressively, and all over the patio area. Feeling ashamed but too intoxicated to physically do anything about it, I rush inside to the guy at the counter, a kind, quiet teenager with an acne problem. I tell him ""I am so so so sorry, I kind of threw up out there and I feel awful about it."" He says, ""Don't worry, it happens all the time."" I say, ""Do you have anything I can use to clean it up with?"" He replies, ""We will take care of it."" I apologize again and gratefully return to my boyfriend's side in the theater. Upon my return, I realized that I must have stumbled on the way out because there was popcorn all over my seat and the floor, and my milkshake had been tipped over as well. Humiliated, I tell my boyfriend what happened and so we left and went home after watching less than 40 minutes of the movie. Needless to say, we tipped that kid working the counter very well. I barely could walk home. 

The next morning, I went to work at 6:30 AM and felt fine, oddly enough. I had enough rum that night to drink jack sparrow under the table."

There's been a number of teams that the Cubs have put together over the years that could have or should have gone the distance (2003 is the most infamous team collapse in my memory, for my dad it would be the 1969 or 1984 teams possibly) but for some reason or another collapsed or failed spectacularly in the playoffs - if they didn't collapse before the playoffs and miss it all anyways.

"Sometimes people just need to vent - they really don't want 'help' or suggestions, what they want/need is someone to listen. 

This can be an issue with husbands and wives at times -- it's typical for men to feel they either *should* solve the issue, or that they're being asked to fix something, so they'll offer help. Often women voice issues not because they're looking for an actual solution, but because they just want to be heard. When these two things collide, you can end up with serious frustration: a woman pissed that her husband won't just listen to her (so she feels like he doesn't care), and a man pissed that his wife won't listen to what he feels is a solution to her problem.

No, but is it going to 100% do the job and be wildly effective? Sure is! Just get a food that is actually monitored to some standard - AAFCO statements are a good thing to look for, and something that suggests they actually made the food for the right life stage of your dog (tested for puppies not all life stages) etc etc.

Feeding a raw diet to a dog is insanely difficult to do right - well not INSANELY, but much more work than it's worth.

"This isn't an issue of party for me, Trump is objectively the worst. I would have voted for a few other republican candidates over Clinton, but I saw through Trump's lies over a year ago.

Almost everything Trump says is an effort to distort the truth in his favor, using words like ""fake news"" and ""alternative facts"" to discredit anything that contradicts his current babble. Meanwhile he's passed executive orders at a nearly unprecedented rate, and is clearly, directly or indirectly, working with Russians to undermine the interests of Americans. He threatens the physical well-being of the lower class by fighting against the ACA without any adequate replacement, and even threatens to force it to fail by not doing his job. His administration has lied under oath and he has given tasks to his family that they are unqualified to do. And don't forget tax breaks just for the rich, so that he can funnel more money out of poor people to pay for his expensive and wasteful projects, like the great wall of mexico. And remember when he, out of the blue, mentions being able to pardon himself of any crimes he ""allegedly"" committed while in office?

His policies reek of authoritarian, nationalistic ideology, and being that he self identifies as right wing, he fits the definition of a fascist. For the sake of people across the whole world, I just hope his incompetence continues to impede his efforts."

"As a historian, I disagree, at least a bit. 

I think that public opinion VASTLY overrates the strategic role of the United States, and vastly underrates the strategic importance of (and sacrifices of) the Soviet Union.   Even outside of the US, pro-American bias of the Cold War has really distorted the actual military course of world War II.   D-Day is known by everyone; Stalingrad more or less ignored. 

And yet, as I wrote below (but in a post that is getting downvoted--which sorta shows my point about 'popular opinion')

D-Day was strategically important.

The turning point of the war in Europe was Stalingrad, January, 1943.
One and a half years before the Americans, British, and Canadians invaded northern France. Stalin had been fuming for two years that the Americans wouldn't open a second front...

...and practically had a stroke when, in 1943, they chose the safe-but-strategic-quagmire of Morocco-Algeria-Sicily-southern Italy,
rather than the more dangerous but more relevant northern or southern France.

By the time of D-Day, the Wehrmacht was fighting a defensive, losing war on the Eastern Front. The Soviets had really already defeated the might of Germany--the USA's contribution at D-Day was an afterthought.

Surprisingly, this truth was common knowledge in 1948. Polls of Frenchmen in the late 1940s of ""who was most responsible for the defeat of Nazi Germany?"" invariably turned up ""The USSR"" as the answer.

By 1980, the same question in France turned up ""The United States.""

40 years of Cold War propaganda has changed the history of the Second World War, not just for Americans, but for the world.

"That, and teaching controversial material without allowing diversity of opinion.

There are many valid arguments against the wage gap. However, opposing viewpoints=lower grade. No room for discussion, no critical thinking or encouraging students to research for themselves. On top of that, it's a required class. This is just one example. I've had a teacher completely trash a certain political group, another wholly blame poverty on capitalism, push for a certain religion, etc. It's great if teachers have their viewpoints and share/discuss them, but to force students to act as though they agree, or else be penalized, is more like indoctrination than education."

"To use the same wording as the other person, ""happy is a strong word for it"".

I actually hate being a woman. But that hate isn't about my gender identity or my relationship with my body. It comes from how most of the world treats me for being dfab. People talk down to me, belittle me, question my intelligence, don't take my thoughts or ideas seriously. I wasn't that interested in STEM fields but I'm damn good at science and was pursuing it anyway until I just couldn't stand the BS I was having to deal with from male peers. I have truly random strangers start quizzing me on when, not if, I plan on having kids, or why I'm not married yet. I hate that if I admit to liking fashion or makeup or glitter, people will start laughing about how I'm a typical high maintenance girl.

I hate the reality of being a woman so much that I have actually examined whether I might be tans or non-binary. At least in my case, my conclusion was that there was important nuance between hating being a woman and hating how women are treated, and that my issues centered on the latter. There are aspects of the female body that are annoying (boobs just get in the way most of the time, an hourglass figure makes buying pants a pain), but they're just inconveniences, not anything that causes me distress. 

I am truly indifferent to most of the feminine aspects of my appearance, and gender stereotypes annoy me rather than cause any sort of dysphoria. So at least for me, thread like this are super important because they serve as an insight into the fact that my own indifference *isn't* the norm, both for trans and cis people."

The (real) rape porn (as opposed to actresses consenting to pretending to be raped) and child porn were the most disturbing things I have ever seen.  There is a network of people that trade videos on the dark web.  Of them abusing women and/or their own kids, then sharing those kids with others and swapping more videos with each other's kids. There are people that have babies for this purpose.  Let me say that again.  They keep having more kids so that they have a constant supply of infant genitals because older children age out eventually and stop being sexy when they get too old.

Besides that he literally has a few thousand videos on the binding of issac in all of its incarnations. It may sound boring as fuck but its kind of just story/conversation time with northernlion. Its very entertaining and even kinda relaxing.

How does this happen 
"My dad became a police officer at 22 or 23, after serving four tours in Vietnam with the marines.  He worked his way from patrolman all the way up to chief (going to night school to get a degree in criminal justice while I was still a toddler).

Thirty three years.  Then he went to go work for the federal government for a little over a decade because his police pension is crap (comparatively).  He's now retired for real.

When he started, police still walked a beat, they used call boxes to call into the station or fire department, as necessary.  No one had radios on foot.  Everyone used .38 specials attached to their belt with a lanyard, had night sticks, and it wasn't uncommon to carry leather sapper filled with lead shot, AKA a blackjack, to make people you were arresting more ""compliant"" (though that was becoming ""old school"" even in the late '60s).

My dad told me a story about how, when he was a young patrolman, he'd just come off midnight when the chief made all the guys stay in the briefing room while agents from the recently formed DEA explained to them how to spot and smell marijuana.  They then had all the officers smoke a little so they understood its effects, what it looked like, smelled like...of course, there wasn't a guy in that room under forty who didn't already know all that, but no one was complaining.

"I like the ubiquitous conviviality of southern Americans, they're were extremely courteous to me when I stayed there for a 3 month duration. I thought the hospitality was a part of their culture that I wasn't really informed about, I've travelled much of Britain as my primary country of residence and as a country reputed as the epitome of decorum, southern Americans are much more accommodating and polite. 

I like how pleasantly curious they were about who I was, I didn't perceive any of their interest as xenophobic like the Media would have me believe. Plus, you're very vivacious in comparison to reticent Europe where I feel like someone will execute me for saying hello. And the distasteful stereotype of my culture does not exist in America as it does in Europe, I wasn't called a 'filthy g*psy' after five minutes of being in public. Being able to browse in shops at my leisure was a welcome alternative too. I even wore my vibrant red dihkle, it's like a headscarf, out in public with a full length skirt with not so much as a passing reproachful mumble. 

Generally you're much more amiable to foreigners than the Media purports. Maybe it's because I'm not native but I encountered no problems at all.  There are definitely some gentlemen in the south who exude the famous southern charm! :)"

"I had a girlfriend in high school who looked back at me in the middle of sex and said ""happy birthday, put it in my butt"" i put the tip in and spent the next 30 mins trying to get her to stop crying."
"Quick Backstory: 
We had been class-mates and friends for about a year and a half. Started out pretty formal, but in the weeks leading up to the night in question, we had hung out and partied with our larger group of friends quite a bit. She's pretty damn cool, and obviously into me; we had a lot in common and had great conversations BUT I had been ignoring some minor red flags. I ignored these signs because I'm far from perfect (who am I to judge her?), and besides these red flags, She seemed like the total package.


So one night She and her roomies throw a party, maybe 20 people; relaxed and intimate. We get a bit flirty, and somehow make a random bet, which she wins. I fork over the money, which she initially tries to decline, but she eventually accepts her winnings. I get hungry, and ask if anyone wants to grab some take-out food. She's the only one interested. But She's not really hungry, and She wants to hit a bar for a quick drink first. She even insists on buying me a drink with the money she won off me.


Seemed like the PERFECT start to a great night. So the two of us leave the party, and as soon as we enter her favourite local bar, a friend of mine (a popular varsity athlete) comes up to me, fist bumping and all hugs. 

Varsity Bro: ""YO! WTF UNSADISFIED!!! I can't get this mother****er out to do ANYTHING; HOW the F**K did you bust him out?!?!""

He goes on about how great a guy I am, and how he owes me. He insists on buying Her and I a drink. Perfect night gets even better as Varsity Bro flexes his wingman skills, and I'm just revelling at how I'll likely never be this cool again. She's very amused by all this, especially about no longer needing to buy me a drink with ""my"" money.


So we push up to the bar, and Varsity Bro (who seems to know EVERYONE) orders us a drink and a shot each, tells me to message him later, grins, and leaves in that same whirlwind of fist-bumps and hugs. 


She and I find ourselves alone again, until we notice a peculiar guy sitting close by a the bar. Peculiar because he had the only chair at the bar, he was mid 30's in a crowd of college kids, and he was face down (semi-passed out) in a big sandcastle-bucket with a crazy-straw poking out. She recognizes him and starts talking to him. Next thing I know she has invited him back to her room (not the party). 


We spend 10-15 minutes getting him stood up and out the bar, during this time She admits She has a couple of usual f**k-buddies. She admits she wants to sleep with Passed-Out-Bucket-Head to make one of her other f**k-buddies jealous (who also happens to have a girlfriend).


All these red flags have been accumulating, and it was pretty much a ""game over"", as far as minesweeper goes. At this point I'm pretty drunk, and just going with the flow of a crazy night. I wasn't getting any romance, but what's new? I'm sure I was disappointed at her being such a let-down, but I was still having a great time partying. I stumbled the 3 of us back to the party, and She and Bucket-Head disappear into her room... But not for long. She boots him out of her room, and as Bucket-Head stumbles out into the night, She nonchalantly asks me if I'm ""too drunk to f**k, too"" and invites me into her room. Charming. Just how I always imagined /s


That should have been the end there, but It's been a long night drinking, and my two heads are in serious conflict. Finally my turn to look bad. I am too weak to say no, but I manage to make sure a third friend joins us in Her bedroom. After some talking, She decides to get ready for bed, strips naked in front of Her friend and I, and puts on on a t-shirt (for bed?). I'm mortified, and avert my gaze. Her friend seems unsurprised, excuses herself and leaves. I quickly left with the friend.

Not my finest moment, But certainly the most feeble attempt at seduction I've ever experienced... And it still nearly worked.

"Can confirm. My parents got into Herbalife and they were mad got a few years that I dismissed it as what it was: a pyramid scheme. It was so full of bullshit it was sad seeing my parents fall for it. 

One time I asked them why they couldn't just sell the product (their bestsellers are 40-60 dollar cans of protein powder) through retail. They said that it would raise the cost, which seemed really shitty because the price was already unreasonable, and they weren't allowed to reduce it for ANY reason when selling. They literally just rehearse what their superiors told them, often without considering the validity of the company's statements. They even sided with Herbalife through all those FBI investigations (wish I had hoped would take them down honestly). If that's not culty behavior, idk what is.

Nowadays, they're mostly done with it (they sell a little but nothing like in the past), and they're burned out from it. Truth be told, I wish I could've said ""I told you so"" to them but the fact that it hurt them and their finances so much, it's not a good feeling to be right. "

"I have so many, so I'll just share the two that happened this week. 

Older woman orders a dish that comes with a cup of hot sauce on the side. It says so on every menu and it's in the picture. She takes her food, and storms back up to the counter a couple minutes later to complain about how we ruined her food with hot sauce. She dumped the whole cup on it, she knew it was hot sauce, didn't taste it beforehand, and was mad at US for ruining the food. 

Similarly aged woman comes up to the counter to place her order, but is very invested in the conversation she's having on the phone. Instead of telling me what she wanted, she would point to the items she wanted. Unfortunately, I have to ask questions about how you want your food prepared and we're not allowed to just assume what you want. So I ask her a question, she hangs up the phone, and she starts shouting ""EXCUSE ME, my mother's dog just died and I'm not about to be interrupted with your LOUD QUESTIONS."" I wasn't loud. But she left the restaurant anyway. I'm just grateful that I didn't have to be blessed by her presence a moment longer. "

"It was way back before the smoking ban, I was drunk in a bar.  

I was happily smoking a cigarette when out of the blue I was struck by quite an urgent need to piss.  

I made my way to the urinals, and before my target.  

Moved cigarette from right hand to mouth to undo my fly.  

Left hand on hem of jeans, cigarette in mouth, right hand pulls down zip.  

Right hand extracts penis from jeans and directs at urinal, meanwhile left hand takes cigarette from mouth.  

I enjoy what was, without wanting to show off, probably one of the most successful urinations in the history of mankind. Good colour, steady stream, nicely aimed, a bona-fide 10/10.  

Then I go to attempt to do the reverse of my previous routine.  

My mind says cigarette from left hand to mouth, right hand put penis away, left hand to hem of jeans, right hand to zip up, wash hands, pat self on back for job well done.  

Somehow what I actually did was cigarette from left hand to mouth, penis from right hand to left hand, cigarette from mouth to right hand, try to do up zip with cock still out and cigarette in hand. Stab self in cock with lit cigarette then trap under-cock-skin in zip.

"Great story and honest perspective and I really appreciate it. But I do take offense to the idea that in all southern white homes racism, black hate, and the N word are part of the norm. I'm a southern white male and grew up in the south and would have been beaten if I got caught saying something racist or hateful to that extreme. Theirs more than one paradigm to southern culture, racism is one, but the good 'ol boy, and matriarch Christian paradigms often exist where racism isn't tolerated. I will NOT say that their isn't still prejudice and ignorance, but that treating other people in a way you want to be treated takes precedence over personal biases. The South is more dynamic then the stereotype we have had placed on us, stereotype and ignorance goes both ways. Many of the nasty southern stereotypes hurt both white southerners and black southerners. "

"You can't yell ""FIRE!"" in a crowded theater.

https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/11/its-time-to-stop-using-the-fire-in-a-crowded-theater-quote/264449/

https://www.thefire.org/a-reminder-about-shouting-fire-in-a-crowded-theater/

It was an analogy first off, not a law.  Second, the case this phrase came from (US v Schenck) was overturned more than forty years ago.  Its not wise to yell fire in a crowded theater but it is not an example of unprotected speech, technically.

Also, despite what every ""expert"" (including Howard Dean) seems to think these days, hate speech IS protected by the first amendment, as unpalatable as the speech might be.  The limits to what you can and can't say are VERY narrow and the supreme court has always been very careful about not overreaching in what limits it sets, hence why flag burning is protected speech, despite what many seem to think.

Fighting Words doctrine is also not something that is often considered in first amendment issues.

"I have to wholeheartedly disagree with you there. When I was learning to drive I drove a whole suite of cars because my moms car was having a whole host of issues so we kept getting rentals. Everything Form Hyundai Santa Fe's to BMW 5-Series's. Today I have a Subaru Outback and I couldn't be happier with it. IMHO It drives better on a daily basis than all of those cars. Don't get me wrong, that 5 series was a pleasure to drive but I don't really miss driving it. Whenever my car is in for service i *miss* it. And to me that's the true measure of a car's quality. The only other car I drove that I miss driving was my cousins prelude that she let me drive a couple times. That thing is a beast. 

Continuing to plug the outback here it is an enormously practical car. I do robotics and during my senior year on my old team my coach wasn't around that often so in between practice sessions and competitions to transport the robot we put it in the back of my Outback. This robot was roughly 3ft by 4ft. And with the seats down I could fit it, all our tools and loads of snacks in the trunk. And drive on icy New Hampshire roads with no problems. The Subaru all wheel drive has saved me from skidding out so often due to black ice it's not even funny. I also have the Eye-Sight package so I have a lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection and a rear view camera. I drive pretty far for work everyday so the adaptive cruise comes in handy quite a bit for dealing with traffic in the city. There are *quite* a few features I wish I had but in general the Outback is a very stable all around car

Tl;Dr: the Subaru Outback is a fantastic car for anyone looking for something stable robust and reliable. And I don't care if it makes me a vaping lesbian. "

"I'd like to go to Costco and buy a single type of item in bulk every week. Just fill up a cart with palettes of erasers. Every week just buy as many palettes as I could fit into my car. Try to go the same time every week and get the same cashier. Don't make eye contact and kind of mumble when they talk to you. Pay in crumpled small bills and exact change. Don't directly hand over the money when the cashier holds her hand out. Just put it on the counter in front of them. 

Come in on another day of the week every week and return several of the erasers for being defective. Get the same returns person too. When they ask what's wrong with the erasers, mumble something about them not being uniform or the wrong shade of pink. 

After doing this for a year, these two employees know you as that eraser guy. Now go to different places all over the area and start leaving single erasers in random locations. Everywhere you go, leave an eraser. Put them under everyone's windshield wipers in the Costco parking lot like a parking ticket. Leave an eraser on the table at the restaurant across the street. Eventually these two Costco employees will see the erasers. They'll see erasers everywhere they go now. Every time they see one of those pink rubber blocks, they feel your presence. You become a ghost, an omnipresent force in their lives. 

Eventually you stop going to Costco but you keep putting erasers everywhere. You have enough now that you can go to other cities and states and start putting erasers everywhere. You anonymously start getting other people across the world to do the same. These Costco employees try to move to escape the erasers but no matter where they run, you're there. They break out in a cold sweat every time they see one now. Everyone else thinks they're insane. 

You hear from one of your eraser cult members that they work with one of these former Costco employees. Start anonymously sending them bouquets of erases to them at work. Find out where they live, open their mail and start erasing random words from their letters. 

They can't stop you now. You are their whole life. The fear of seeing erasers has consumed them and they have to go off the grid and into hiding. They only write in pen now. After they die with people thinking they're insane, have followers leave an eraser on their gravestone every year.

"Charlenes are the most conspicuous of British chavs. She's resplendent with her newly acquired suntan from the dilapidated tanning salon on the street corner that was converted from a petrol station. You can glimpse her dishevelled hair extensions through the pervasive smoke of her cigarettes and her obstreperous brood of children march behind her like a monarch train of an urchin laboured dress. Her face is distorted with inexpensive makeup and a lack of proficiency in application, her ever distinct eyebrows allude to her desire to emulate Kim Kardashian. She's even contemplated releasing a sex tape. Her smile is diminished, yellowing and contrived as she calls for one of her errant brood but you can hear the incipient impatience beginning to invade her tone. 
She walks past homeless people and has the audacity to smirk disdainfully but she refrains from deigning to pursue any occupation. She frequently concocts unscrupulous plans to perforate her partners condoms; she requires another benefits payment as she has frivolously dissipated through their monthly funds on inauthentic designer clothes. She peruses her 6 inch red talons and decides she needs an alcoholic beverage before she indulges in her favourite past time of gossiping on her front lawn with her equally distasteful neighbour. 

TLDR; She's an incorrigible chavette. Her name is Charlene, she'll make an intoxicated proposition you'll be paying for the 18 years if you're seduced by her hot Stellar imbued breath. "

"Just a friendly reminder that platitudes like this - as nice sounding and well intended as they certainly are - can be really dangerous when you're talking to a clinically depressed person.

Not only do the often not help - they can often have the exact opposite effect.

I've been dealing with depression for most of my life, and trivial comments like this has made me want to punch people in the face out of sheer frustration.  
I haven't actually punched anyone of course, I know they mean well, but my ape brain wants to. Really badly. Because the platitude they just uttered hurt me like hell.

There have been times where good friends, after having said similar platitudes and I've asked them kindly to stop, have insisted they're ""true"" and kept saying them, where it literally kicked off a mental breakdown in me. Really sent me down the deep end for days.

Everyone is different. This includes people with depression. For some they might help. In my experience enough of us can react like this that it's a warning worth giving though.

My personal advice for helping people with real, clinical depression is to listen, and specifically *don't give advice*. No advice. At all. Period. Just ask questions, and listen to their answers.  
Quite often, having someone take your troubles seriously is all you need. It can help a ton.  
Having someone dismiss your sometimes life-threatening issues (the person could be suicidal) with what a depressed person could interpret as a simple ""Just be happy!"" advice can do real damage."

"post-op pain management isn't the same as a full-on IV heroin habit. 

calling physical withdrawal ""more like having a cold for a few days"" fully demonstrates to me that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about, even if your conclusions are on point.

edit- i'm going to add this here so people don't have to scroll through a bunch of unfounded bs to get the gist- your misinformed opinion that you're spreading as truth is *literally* harmful. you've just in one fell swoop claimed that heroin = morphine and that heroin withdrawals are mainly psychological only, with minor physical discomfort akin to cold symptoms. this is wrong. 

you are going to make some parent who's dealing with an addicted son or daughter for the first time to think to themselves, ""what's wrong with my son/daughter? it's not a big deal; it's *just like a cold.* why are they breaking the law to get high when it's *all in their head*; if they were *stronger* they would be fine. i quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey, why can't they quit heroin when nicotine is *more addictive than heroin*?"" you're going to get a parent dealing with the devastation of addiction to do something rash like call the cops the moment they find drug paraphernalia in their child's room instead of getting them professional help because ""*a month in jail will teach them a lesson and they can cold turkey while locked up and get clean; it's for their own good.*""

your lackadaisical attitude towards the nuance of heroin addiction is the same as the random asshole with literally no experience and not even a hint of a half-educated opinion to scoff at an addict and say ""why don't they just *quit*?"" whoever the buttmunch is that came to those conclusions in whatever paper you googled is literally what is wrong with addiction medicine today. they're the ones that don't listen to their patients when they claim they're having physical issues and write it off as an addict's drug seeking behavior and then scoff and say ""i was totally right"" when said frustrated patient quits the program and cops off the street.

"You seem to have a misunderstanding of the impact of Barry Bee Bensons court case.
Yes, in the movie it was just the Human owned Bees that got released and any human owned honey handed over, ceasing production on all honey products.
But this had an effect on the environment and Bee lifestyle as a whole.
The Bees saw no need to pollinate for honey because with all the confiscated honey handed over they had plenty, it's also possible the ""Pilot Bees"" did not see why they should sprinkle other flowers or contribute to the environment, maybe viewing it as helping humans.
Whichever ways, it was that the court case inspired a movement of laziness and selfishness within the Bees so they saw no need to produce honey, which led to the downfall of the environment.
The question of why the Bees won the honey was that ""HUMANS AS A SPECIES HAS NO RIGHT FOR BEE HONEY"" so even though it's not *their honey* it's the Bees species honey so it should be distributed.
(Also bee farms are much more efficient at producing honey, and with years of honey on shelves their was plenty to go around.)

"This was quite literally ""trashy.""

So a few years ago, I picked up some Appalachian Trail thru-hikers in the Smokies to drive up to Damascus, VA for Trail Days, which is a huge weekend festival of all things hiking. We had a blast, and I had a few more days off work after the weekend, so I decided I would finish the last leg of the national park with them. When we got back into the Smokies, we had to stop at the Sugarlands Visitors Center, because I had to get a backcountry camping permit (thru-hikers didn't need them at the time, but I did). After I got my permit I walked back to my truck and I couldn't believe what I saw. 

One of the guys in our group was known by the trail name ""moneybags"" because he biked from Oregon to Springer Mtn, and had hiked all the way to Tennessee/NC on literally $20. I was about to find out how. As I'm walking back to the truck, I see him completely in the bear-proof dumpster pulling out half eaten sandwiches and foodstuffs. He stuffed them in his pack and we headed up the mountain. The smell wasn't really an issue, as we all stunk from living outside for certain periods of time. We hiked in to the first shelter that night and all was well. 

A full day later, I run into Moneybags at a shelter eating a late lunch that consisted of a bologna sandwich and a spinach salad that he had rustled up the day before. I'm sure there was mayo on that sandwich, and there was no refrigeration, it was May, and it was hot. Holding myself back from blowing chunks, I wolfed down my Clif Bar and moved on down the trail. 

That was the last time I saw Moneybags, but I don't think I'll ever forget that.  "

For a while, at least.  Then the US Navy pilots started to work on ways to cut down on the Zeros advantages, then they were given planes that outperformed the Japanese plane, and so on and so forth.  But an easy argument can be made that it wasn't until 1943 that the Zero was supplanted as the best fighter in the Pacific... unless you think that the Ki-61 or the Ki-44 were better?

"No no he's not engaged to her cousin. Esmeralda's parentage is not even known till nearly the end of the book, she's thought to be a gypsy. Phoebus is engaged to some girl but she doesn't put out. He comes to know Esmeralda has a huge crush on him so he manipulates her into sleeping with him. But Frollo attacks just then and nearly kills Phoebus. Everyone thinks that Esmeralda is a witch (because that makes sense?) and she is arrested. Phoebus lives, but he refuses to even recognize Esmeralda. It's a really sad story."

"This is where the show is really nuanced, because I think multiple readings of the situation are correct. Your takeaway is, on one level, 100% accurate. 

On another level though, I think it becomes clear throughout the series that Hannibal thinks that all the horrible things he does are *helping* Will. At the beginning of the show Will is a neurotic mess, and Hannibal thinks that pushing him will make him stronger. Ultimately, he's sorta right - S3 Will is a way more confident man. 

I am not saying that Hannibal's methods are good - obviously, he's a crazy person, and the things he does to Will are objectively awful. But I think that while his motivations are certainly part curiosity and part sadism, there is an element of genuine concern. He honestly thinks Will will be much happier if he lets his darker impulses out and tries to poke him in that direction. "

"Heroin addiction can make you very depressed and suicidal. I've been there. For me it was a more logical kind of suicidal thought where I would have never admitted it to anyone. That would have been a reason for people to pay closer attention to me.

However, I don't think he killed himself. Way too many inconsistent details around the way the gun fell, the horrible investigation, Courtney's lunatic ass, and that dude Cali who was at the house, or wasn't, or was but he left, after he saw Kurt, but he never saw him...

There was so many addicts, so much money, and way too many disagreements between Kurt and Courtney for her not be involved. 

My uneducated theory is that she found out about his plan to divorce her because Kurt told Cali when he got home from the rehab he left. Kurt told Cali that he had a couple days to find somewhere else to live, since he was living there and was Courtney's friend. 

Cali about to be without somewhere to stay called her, and she leveraged his need for housing/money/drugs into killing Kurt. 

Cali knew kurt went to the upstairs room over the garage, and followed him up with the gun. When he saw Kurt was nodding out he changed plans and gave him another massive dose to cause an od. 

Kurt kinda came back to, and started asking questions, Cali panicked and shot him, put the gun in his hand and it started to sink in what he had done, which is why Kurts hair was all perfectly positioned.

 He  wiped his prints away and locked the door on his way out. Once he left he gave Courtney the go ahead to send the investigator up to the house. 

Cali hightailed it down to LA to meet Courtney who gave him some money and some dope to go hide away somewhere. 

I've lived in the addict world and I can see how every step here (by all parties involved) would make sense to someone on heroin. "

Everyone tried to be accepting of her but it got extremely hard to be nice to her or enjoy yourself around her. She's just a toxic person, she'll act sickly sweet to you one minute and then turn around and breath fire the next. She was constantly sick with some new type of rare disease and wanted everyone's pity. 

Against all logic my uncle and her get pregnant and fast forward 13 years, they are going through a horrific divorce and this woman is 100% a nut case. My uncle tries not to talk too much shit about her, which makes no sense she's an awful person who is ruining his kid. 

For many years her many mental issues were hidden from the family and has apparently threatened my uncle several times saying she would harm herself if he left. Pretty certain she has Munchausen by proxy and is always rushing my cousin to the hospital and making up illnesses and bullying doctors into making diagnosis'.

"I think that's kinda what's deeply unsettling about Griffith: he doesn't seem to mind sacrificing so many people for his dream. Even his family ends up being eaten and raped to grant him more power.
What's also fucked up is that, although he had a fairly rough year leading up to the eclipse, what seem to have triggered it was that Casca did not stay to care for him out of her old blind love, but out of pity. And he could not stand that even his 'backup plan' (to put it horribly) would not work out.

"My freshmen year of college my friend and I found a dead body in a small water reservoir along a forest path. It was face down, floating on the surface. It was very quiet in the woods, and the water looked like dark glass. 


I called 911 and tried explained where we were. For some reason it was hard for the operator to understand what I meant by ""We found a dead body"". She kept thinking I was talking about an animal body so I had to clarify it was a *human* body. It started hailing pretty hard once I got off the phone. The cops and EMT came, and the sheriff gave us a ride out of the woods before the body was removed. We went to the station to write our statements and answer a few questions. They told us there was no foul play suspected, but that they couldn't release the identity of the body. We were already both sadbois as the time, so we mostly just shook it off. Didn't tell my roomate or anyone else in my dorm. 

It made the evening news, but our names weren't mentioned.

The next day, right before my first class I got a call from the cops who said they had identified the body as my friend, whom left on a Tinder date the night before we found him. They wanted to let me know in private before the announcement was made (the forest was on school property). 

The college made it out to look like an alcohol accident, and lectured us on that. A bunch of conspiracy theories circulated on social media about murder and serial killers. I'm confident it was a suicide.

It was very weird for me, knowing that we had found my friend's body without knowing it. I think I had already figured it out by the time I got the call from the police, but I wasn't sure. It was like he died over the course of 24 hours. "

This was her role as a prisoner to look in horror as he made her want to do these awful things. Also, at this point she was a rookie hero. She was forced to hurt people and worst of all, it wasn't against her will as he forces you to want to do that. Thats why she ends up so messed up when we see her at the beginning of the book. Brilliant end to a great series."

But he kept insisting ""No no Biden you go first!"" After two days of trying not to ruin his lungs with my toxic waste, I cracked and screamed ""I DONT WANT TO FART ON YOU! GO FIRST!""

Just a reference for those who don't know anything about Griffith or the Manga Berserk.

Griffith was the leader of a mercenary group in the mid-evil times called ""The Band of the Hawk""

He single handedly created this group, cared for them , loved them, protected them, guided them...... etc

When it mattered most and he had everyones lives in the palm of his hand, he betrayed them all to gain power.

As a result of the betrayal his entire band was viciously murdered by demons and forced to spend eternity suffering in hell.

He also raped his closest friend girl in front of his eyes while he was held down and made to watch. As a result of the rape his friends unborn child was also damaged permanently and his girl suffered mental lapse that she has never recovered from since.

Did I mention that this all happened while the Band of the Hawk were in the process of rescuing him?

"I'm from a village in the UK. I don't live there anymore but when I did, we'd get gypsies pass through for about 2 weeks a year.

Burglary became expected when they arrived. In the summer it wasn't unusual for people to leave house windows open whilst at work. Or to leave the garage doors open whilst having a BBQ on the back garden. If the gypsies were in town you would get burgled.

They would steal fence panels, copper/other metals from the outside of properties. They'd steal valuable pet breeds to sell on and treat their own animals like shit.

They set up camp wherever they like and ruin the area in the process. They have massive fires in the middle of fields. They leave their rubbish everywhere when they leave. They even set a few cars on fire just before I left.

People were afraid to go to the little shopping area we had because of the abuse you'd get from them. They'd beg you to buy alcohol then scream at you when you refuse. 

People would get beat up and money stolen, especially at the weekend walking home from the pub.

Police either couldn't or wouldn't do anything about them. They were a 2 week hurricane, they'd destroy anything they touched and left us to pick up the bill.

It's no surprise the majority of people hate them."

"Answer: Start by focussing on you.


Honest, go to the gym 3 days a week.  It's superficial but both the chemicals this releases internally and the improvement to your self perception will improve things greatly.  Do this for 80 days to begin to see a marked psychological improvement.


Concurrently, improve your mind by meditating for 10 mins a day.  Just feel the pressure of the air pressing down on your body.  As other thoughts enter your mind, remind yourself of the weight of the air pressing down on your body.  Begin to imagine an eraser erasing the boundary between your body and the air.


This does not lead to perfect happiness.  But you will discover a physical and spiritual harmony that will grant you contentment even during unhappy times."

"That comic hits close to home for a lot of people with mental illness.    

Human beings have a tendency to relate their experiences in a way that has little regard for perspective, as if the phenomenon of human life and the natural world were absolute concepts unaffected by awareness.    

Fortunately, often people with mental illness realise this distinction and can accept disregard of mental illness as something borne out of inexperience.    
In other cases, a person might not realise the ineptitude of others in labelling or condescending towards mental illness and actually believe that they alone are to blame for their situation.

"100 000 black solders in the french army is not 65% of it. No more than 220 000 solders from North Africa were involved (its more likely 130 000) and contrary to popular belief not all of them were locals (Army of Africa includes all armed forces in North Africa, both local and french). So at best 320 000, more like 250 000. This is talking about the army that had 2 200 000 people in it.

They just give you this print out with the bill and then your coverage with TriCare (which luckily for me was 100%). 

It was crazy to know that if we weren't military we would have been financially crippled and without a baby. I can see why people get depressed and commit suicide after early birth infant loss. It's like in one moment you lose everything. "

"Not sure if you actually believe this, or if you're just paraphrasing the reasoning of some detractors, but this is emphatically false.  

Marriage wasn't a strictly religious invention -- across many cultures, its early forms were often secularly private and non-institutional.

One thing that may people don't understand is that psychology is an incredibly young branch of science that deals with one of the most unknown and least understood parts of the body the brain and cognition. As more credible findings are made and reviewed to be confirmed the building blocks are still being put in place. There are a lot of great people out there doing a lot of great work but the possibilities of where we could go with psychology is both awesome and scary.

Every single bill was $150+, I always went with exact change for the oil change after tax and played the poor college student / I didn't approve any other work option. Every single time they grumbled and agreed that I was in the right, paid for only the oil change and left.

Plus, Eustace has been bald his whole life.

A lot of Eustace's actions are clearly mirrored from his childhood, such as his overwhelming greed, shouting at Courage he's a ""Stupid Dog!"" The ""OOGA-BOOGA"" Mask is literally just like the one his mother taunted him with.

Deep down, Eustace feels inadequate, believing financial success is the only measure of a man. He is but a poor farmer who is incapable of growing anything (There was an entire episode based around his feelings of inadequacy at being a farmer) with no children, and clearly projects his own inner turmoil onto Courage, the closest thing they have to a child.

TL;DR Eustace can be a douche, the show DOES talk about it, but it's due to his rather tragic upbringing. He's cold and bitter because of it."
"There are a few services out there that will go to most of the major vendors and remove your publicly available information.

If you find information about yourself from one of these background-checking websites, scroll to the bottom of the page and look for their ""opt out"" or ""data removal"" page. 99% of them have a self-removal tool.

If you have any court or criminal records, you can usually have it expunged by the courthouse for a small fee (assuming it's less than a felony). Lots of websites will require you to submit proof of expungement for criminal records when you ask them to opt you out.

Outside of that, I suggest using fake names whenever possible. If you need to buy something online, use a pre-paid credit card that you get at the grocery store (Visa or Mastercard). If you need to provide a phone number, use a fake one or a Google Voice number.

You *will* get put into the system if you apply for a credit card, though - especially if you're bad at paying on it or if you keep a high balance. Credit card companies and banks are much more willing to give out your info if you're bad about paying. You'll know because you'll start receiving lots of ""pay off your debt NOW"" spam in the mail. But either way, a loan or credit card in your name will put you into the system pretty darn quick.

"&gt;What kind of effects has Reddit had on your life?

When I was 20, I went to war. Spent 18 months in Vietnam, came back changed. I didn't know what was up with me. We all came ""home"" one-at-a-time, and were thrown back into civilian life. PTSD wasn't known - if you were immobilized and crippled by ""shell-shock,"" you might get treatment at the VA. I was trying to go to college - not another vet in sight. I was on my own.

I didn't do well. I guess I was supposed to make a quantum-shift from war to peace - forget the lives-at-risk responsibilities I had overseas. Now it was time to get educated. Me time, I guess. I had no concept of ""me"" - I had been part of a unit, and people's lives depended on me doing my job.

I felt like a deep-sea fish suddenly pulled to the surface of the ocean. All the pressure was gone, nothing was important. Nothing. Just do what you want to do, right? You're free! I had no wish to be free, and no idea what I wanted to do.

The next decades didn't go well. I got an advanced degree, a dream job, a family. Then I crashed with a suicide gesture and ended up in a VA Psych ward. PTSD was a thing on the ward, but NOT in the VA. It was viewed as a scam to get a disability pension. 

But I found some people there that I could talk to. I had tried to tell folks what happened to me, but they all just looked sympathetic and frightened. Lots of pity, no laughs, not even for the funny stories.

This is tl;dr. In sum, I tried to write it all out, but my stories were viewed with horror by the few people I let read them. I was carrying a heavy weight.

And four years ago I found reddit - specifically /r/Military - and an audience that laughed in the right places, got mad at the right things, felt sympathy at the right places. I wish there was a reddit thirty years earlier. 

I discovered I could write my stories for such an audience, and they came flowing, staggering and reeling out of my head, and onto /r/MilitaryStories. I just wrote and wrote. And read stories by other people. And felt at home, understood.

Can't say enough good about that. I'm pushing 70, and I feel 100 pounds lighter. Carried that stuff for a long time. Turns out I just needed to get it out of my head where I could look at it, face it down. 

Did reddit cure me? Yeah, in a way. I'm happy and grateful. I feel lucky, and I should. I was. Every day is a gift.

So thanks, reddit. You know not what you do. But sometimes you do WAY better than expected."
"They don't need to invent any loopholes because they don't have any understanding or 'belief' of physics in the first place.  

They don't even realize that the shape of the planet can be deduced by observations they themselves can make.  It's so far above their knowledge or patience they presume people believe the earth is round merely because people told them so.

They could become unimaginably rich and powerful to 'prove' that the earth is flat, but you know doing a few tests themselves and with like minded disbelievers around the world is just too much doggone effort."

"It's not necessarily fair to characterize one's inability to obtain a mortgage as 'standards and priorities.' My credit is fine, my husband and I are well employed, but the one specific government program you cited doesn't really apply to us. His job has a residency requirement, which means we can't move outside City limits. We have managed to save more than $10k but that doesn't come close to the percentage the bank is looking for for a reasonable interest rate mortgage. The housing market around us has exploded in the last two years and people are buying anything under 300k with cash. So it's not that simple. But the RD program is great where it applies. It just doesn't apply to us."

"More fun with NBA phrasing for people in 2007:

LA Clippers fans: Shaun Livingston is an NBA champion.

Seattle Supersonics fans: so much ammo it's practically a war crime to use it all. I'll just say they will pick two future MVPs, one of which is a finals MVP and leave it at that.

New Jersey Nets fans: You'll get Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce.

Celtics fans: You'll get Ray Allen and he'll win two championships.

Minnesota Timberwolves fans: Kevin Garnett will spend his last season on your team. (Less funny if I'm telling them this after he's traded or if they hear what I said to Nets fans)

Also Ron Artest will become MUCH crazier. That's not phrasing, that's just something people wouldn't have believed possible."

Either by her getting in trouble directly caused by the way she was or the other kids being like (obviously paraphrasing), ""Angelica's in trouble? Who cares, she's a bitch."" And Tommy saying something like, ""Yeah she is, but she's family."" (Which is not a sentiment I personally hold but that's another story).

"I had two friends growing up. They were brothers and they lived down the road. Their mother was a beautiful European woman. Their father was a chiseled man's man who was our troop leader, a master furniture maker and earned a good living. They lived in a beautiful old farmhouse that was tastefully being restored. They had acres of fields where they let a modest herd of sheep roam. The mother knit amazing sweaters from the wool while we played in the forest and fields. 

I went on my first hike at 9 years old with this family. The mother taught me to swim in a lake near our homes. The boys had vivid imaginations and many of the surviving fantasy narratives from my childhood were crafted by the three of us. 

Their house burned down (due to old wiring) and they lost everything. Over the next couple months they built an amazing home in its place. The interior was stunning, bright, well appointed. The kids had all new clothes, new toys and everything lego set you could imagine. I was jealous. My working class home seemed shabby. My parents seemed uneducated and boorish. My mother made country quilts for the church fair, not amazing sheepswool tunics and sweaters. I spent a lot of time there. 

One morning after spending the night, there was a lot of banging around coming from my friend's parents' room. My friend said ""Parents' like to wrestle too."" I don't think ""wrestling"" was quite what they were doing. 

Another time I was upstairs playing and I heard the father say loudly ""Why did you come to this country if you can't fucking read?"" I went home shortly after. 

I found a drawing one of the boys did of a maze, where a stickman representing their dad was forced to go through various torture chambers. 

Their Dad never let them call him Dad. He made them call him by his first name. 

I came home from school one day and there was a greeting card taped to my door with my name on it. My mom sat me down and we read it together. The mother had taken the boys while the father was at work and fled the country. 

It's been 20+ years. I've haven't seen them since. "

"Going back and watching that show really ruins it though. I mean I knew I'm older and the show would obviously not be as scary but straight up a lot of things that made it creepy were only creepy to kids. The dialog was mostly funny or not too serious.

"Social media.

Always made sense to me to do things like stay in touch with your family and friends, follow celebrities, stuff like that. But girls (and guys) as young as high school getting strangers to follow them, and bragging about it.

I've listened to girls talk for ""like"" an hour about their like strategy for Instagram.

"When I was 18 I once camped outside a card/gift store for a full 12 hours to make sure I got a limited edition Teddy Bear.

My then-GF-now-Ex decided she just had to have one, but came to the conclusion she wasn't getting one. I decided otherwise...

That night I dressed warm and I sat in the doorway from 8pm until 8am to make sure I got that bear. Some dickhead even threw a load of change into my coffee. The shop opens, some middle aged women who's been hovering around for the last 5 minutes before opening storms up to the counter and demands it. We argue back and forth, I'm not going to let it go after camping all night... the guy on the till sides with her (she's really pretty, he's kinda odd looking and been stairing at her chest the whole time)... She buys it, then offers it to me for a £20 mark-up, doubling the price, since she's just going to sell it on eBay when she gets home anyway.

I very begrudgingly bought the bear and went home. I gave it to her on Valentine's Day, was totally worth the camping and being ripped off to see her so happy. She never found out what I had to do to get it."

"Then I have a little story for you.

I am part of a small cryptocurrency mining pool. Our admin is a pretty cool sysadmin guy from Vienna.

One day, he sends on the pool's chat a picture of the view from his office - pretty tall building, but no clearly recognizable features in there, and had I not known the city it was taken in, I would have had no clue.

Still, I was very bored, and out of fun I decided to see if I could find the building he works in. 5 minutes of googling later, I knew exactly which building it was taken from, and from which side.

He then challenged me to figure out what floor it was taken from. 30 minutes, some basic pixel counting, and some napkin math later, I correctly guessed the floor. Mind you, this was with no other prior knowledge of any kind, just a generic nondescript picture and a city name.

Had I been a bad person, I could have easily gone on and figured out the exact company he works for, and escalated from there.

Now, you could argue that this was just his fault for oversharing a picture online. But the truth is that, in the right hands, pretty much *any* data can become a problem.

I believe that it is better to err on the side of safety and avoid sharing anything at all, rather than hope that the company you just sold yourself to *actually* handles your data properly and *really* follows strict anonymization and security practices. After all, it it really were not much of a big deal, nobody would be fighting to try to keep all the data-harvesting companies in line."

"Current titleholder and beauty pageant enthusiast here. Didn't compete in my first pageant until I was 18. Have met *very few* adult pageant girls who competed before the age of 16. We all typically agree that the child pageants are outrageous.

Growing up, I knew two beautiful girls (sisters) whose mom forced them into pageantry at very young ages. Seeing their airbrushed headshots and all that spray tanning was horrifying. These girls were like 5 &amp; 6 years old. They opted out by around 6th grade though. 

As for narcissistic pageant girls - there are usually a select few out of the entire group of competitors at each pageant. You can *always* spot them without even having to speak to them. And as u/nativeofvenus said, they're usually the ones who started competing fresh out of the womb. The rest of us are actually pretty humble, for the most part. Probably because we've never had Mom and Dad telling us that beauty pageants make us superior to others, and we have actually experienced self-hatred at some point. "

"Unpopular opinion time, but drunk driving sentencing is getting excessive. Every year there are higher penalties or more jail time and more courses being tacked on because MADD and other organizations lobby for it to justify heir existence and of course politicians cave because it’s easy political points for being tough on crime. Of course nobody is going to form an advocate group to defend drunk drivers, so there’s no opposition. 

Listen, I don’t think drunk driving should exist, there’s certainly many atrocities that’s happened because of it. But you also shouldn’t take someone who had one drink and drove home and potentially ruin their finances and livelihood because of it. "

"I renounced my US citizenship a few years ago and I'm a UK citizen now. I would never go back in a million years and am so much happier now that I've gone through the entire process. 

What I hadn't expected was that I found it was really scary going through all the paperwork over the years, having to apply for the different levels (permission to live and work in the UK, residency, right to remain, citizenship) after the right amount of time had passed for what felt like forever. It was like a constant dark cloud of another 40-50 pages of the same information to fill in and send off along with your passport and birth certificate and letters from your employers and pay slips and then hold your breath and hope that you get through again and constantly being anxious that something might go wrong, maybe you answered a question wrong, maybe they just decide to say no altogether - they have literally all of the power and you have none at all and they could change your life permanently with one stamp. And knowing that with each level you get to you have to wait another 3/5/7 years to apply for the next closer to permanent level and go through it all again. Also the fees were really high and kept getting higher as time passed. I think between renouncing my US citizenship and gaining my UK citizenship I spent around $8k, and the price went up substantially since I managed to get through the process. 

I didn't expect to have to make so many appointments with the US Embassy in order to renounce my citizenship. I think it came to 4 appointments so that they could be sure that I was sure. I also didn't expect to have to swear an oath to the flag as part of the process and it felt silly talking to an inanimate object instead of a person.

As for the actual living in another country part, it's amazing. I spent most of the process just being scared they'd stop me and send me back and take me away from all of the things I love about living here. The way of life, the food, the beer, the NHS, all of the accents, the climate, the countryside, the cities, the people... It's all totally different to what I knew before but to me it's what I wanted more."

"This happened last year.  These three girls had a chipped card.  While our card readers require you to insert the card if it has a chip, for whatever reason, the card crashed the self checkout register that the leader of the group was using.  They went to another one, and that one also crashed.  I don't think I was majorly busy at the time, but I don't like having too many registers down at a time.  So I took them to my register(we have a regular register at our self checkouts in case of situations like this or if someone pays with a check).  For whatever reason, the card will not read at all on my register. 

This, according to the group, makes me a racist.  So racist, in fact, they not only accuse me of not caring about their struggle, but they want my employee information and first and last name, and drive me to tears.  Thankfully, my CSM switched me out with another cashier for the rest of my shift.  I still haven't forgiven the assistant manager who let them yell at me. 

They also terrified another customer who watched the incident. "

An associate of mine was doing WIC for a customer and wasn't doing it fast enough so the customer called him a n****r.  They then got a 5$ gift card for having to wait so long so yeah the assistant manager really shit the bed on that one.  (I wasn't there but it would have been out of my hands anyway).

""What the fuck do you mean it didn't go through?! Are you fucking kidding me?! My card is valid i just went to buy gas earlier today. How fucking dare you?! How can you insult me like I'm poor?!"" 

And he just goes on like that for like 10 mins. And I just don't care from working for so long, that i have no reaction. I wait until he finishes yelling to tell him, ""could you please try swiping slower next time?"" 

He's muttering to himself and swipes his card. Lo and behold, it works. I'm just relieved this asshole is leaving. He offers no apologies, grabs his shit and just leaves. The people behind him in line are in shock. Every single customer that saw him yell are telling me what a jerk he was for doing that. 

Everytime a customer acted like that, the customers who saw that would always be kinder and nicer because of seeing that jerk and would always point out their awful behavior. It is one of the only things that gave me faith in humanity.    "

"Ahh, but you forget the great war of 2074. After the Nanotechnological Revolution in the 50's, countries have begun to develop nanorobotic weapons of mass destruction. This leads to great tension between Taiwan (which rose to become a world superpower along with China by absorbing North Korea after its long-due collapse), the United States, and the Russian-Arabian coalition. The tension between the three world powers rose to a breaking point in the early 70's, when China (an ally of Taiwan) attacked Russia, provoking the wrath of its many allies who used nanorobotic weapons that were strictly prohibited as a war crime by the United Nations. This provoked the United States to enter the war. However, Taiwan and the United States were on very poor terms, and when the US entered Taiwanese territory, they considered it an act of war. The US suffered the most from this war, due to many factors, not the least of which was the fact that they had to transport troops and supplies across the ocean. In 2074, the US was forced to withdraw their troops, and Taiwan and the coalition followed them back home. Thus began the first land invasion of the US in several hundred years. The battles were long and hard, and by the end of the war, every viable man and women was drafted, and 2/3 had died. So much money was poured into the war that medicine became absurdly expensive, and the elderly were unable to pay for proper healthcare, and thus died by the millions.

There was also the time an old man got trampled to death and security footage showed other customers walking around his dead/dying body as they left, with proud smiles on their faces. And then the numerous times people have gotten into legit fistfights or pointed firearms at each other over merchandise.

At this rate I'm honestly surprised they don't just post cops outside of big box stores on Thanksgiving night to watch over Black Friday bullshit.

Sean Archer had a scar on his chest from the fateful day when his son(carousel sniper victim) was killed. He asked the doctor to make sure to give him that scar back when it was time to return to being himself.

As for the genitalia - that was never addressed, and we know for a fact that Eve and Castor Troy (as Sean Archer) fornicated.

When your Macaw curses like a sailor, that dramatically reduces the amount of people willing to adopt him.

"Believe it or not lots of lower income people are frighteningly unaware of breast cancer, how to prevent it, and how curable it really is. Not trying to disparage people of low incomes, it's just what the statistics show. 1 in 5 women will get breast cancer in their lives, but if it's caught by mammograms in the first two stages the survival rate is over 99%. After Stage 2b, the numbers drop appallingly fast. Awareness is important to get women into clinics and get themselves checked.

I know her research, it's really interesting, has wide ranging impacts, and way more humane than most animal research (which I also think is mostly pretty humane).  She puts the birds in a PET scanner so she doesn't have to kill them FFS! Her research has been used to help sea turtles and dolphins impacted by oil spills.

"I was interviewing for a job and accidentally grabbed the boob of the woman interviewing me.

It was a decently long interview, and she suggested we take a walk around the neighborhood while chatting, and then we went to a Starbucks to get some coffee. While in line, some homeless guy came running in screaming at the top of his lungs, which caused the people in line to surge away from him.

The woman interviewing me lost her footing and basically fell in to me, I put my arms out to catch her, but managed to only get one on her torso, the other got a handful of boob. I did manage to keep her from falling, along with the guy next to me. She was about 65 - so easily 35 years my elder, married, but was well put together in a business suit.

We didn't speak of the boob grab, other than just a bit of amazement at the whole scene with the crazy homeless guy.

After another round of interviews, I was actually offered the job but decided on a position at another company. Nothing to do with the boob grab though!"

"We live in a fairly rural town, my grandfather here has a farm that I help on a lot. My farther, however, holds a job as IT security for a larger company and drives 45-50 minutes to get there, and again to get back. I'm studying for computer science too, and when I finish my degree if I looked for a job in our town, there simply wouldn't be anything.

Agriculture, law enforcement, and teaching are the more focused professions when you think about rural living, but that's not how the grand majority of people make a living here. Most households here have the husband working in a factory that produces insulation, and the wife working in retail or food services. Lots of smaller rural towns are like this.

Personally, I'm not a fan of either factory/retail or long travel for living here. In all likelihood, I'll move away to find my job, probably live more like ~20 minutes outside a larger city that has the type of job I'm looking for."

"Prior to the ACA a lot of people didn't work because it was financially in their best interest not to work.

Take this example: in a rural Ohio county the best job most people can get might right around minimum wage and have miserable or no health insurance. So let's say that Bob chooses to work a shitty factory job and make $20k to $30k a year with little or no health insurance. Jim works at the same job and makes the same money. Then they both develop an illness that is expensive to treat.  Bob stays at the factory job, and is then forced into bankruptcy because he can't pay the medical bills. He loses his house and has to move in with relatives. Jim, realizes that he is better off quitting his job and getting medicaid to pay for his illness. So that is what he does. Jim actually made the better decision in terms of his own welfare. 

I have seen this play out numerous times in rural Ohio. Without universal health care, some people are better off financially if they don't work. It doesn't have anything to do with laziness. It is simply about making the best financial decisions for yourself."

"Well yes and no. Your hair (on your head) grows on average .5 inches a month. That doesn't change unless you are taking certain medications that can stunt the growth of your hair. 

Naturally your hair will get split ends. And no, using that olive oil and egg mask will not repair it. You have to cut them off to get rid of them. When a hairstylist says your hair won't grow unless you cut it, they mean that your split ends will keep splitting up the hair shaft. Leaving you with weak ends that can break. Thus your hair won't grow unless you cut it. 

As for the shaving/waxing having body hair come back thicker... Your body had 3 phases for hair. The growing phase, resting, and release. During the growing phase, your hair comes to a tiny point (thin at the tip and thick at the base). When you shave it off, you are left with a blunt end that is still in the follicle of your skin. And when that starts to grow out, that can make it appear that your hair is growing thicker. If you let your hair grow to its resting point, and after it sheds naturally, a new hair will start growing. Leaving you with the tapered end.

"I work at the food court at my local mall (nice job for a 32 yo mum, wouldn't u say!? Eheheheh). I started working there about three weeks ago and there is this girl who was working there two full weeks prior. I am really starting to be annoyed by her. She acts like madre Theresa and she is so full of herself just because she works in another place (temporarily) and here for 20h a week. I have a 35h a week schedule (full time in Portugal is 40h a week) so i can't really work anywhere else coz of kids and family... Moving on: last week i was unloading the dishwasher at work and extremely hot water fell on my leg. Thank god i work in trousers or else i will be badly burned. That girl had ripped a inch on her trousers a few hours before and had been talking about that the entire night. My manager saw me getting the water on my leg and ran to me, asking if i was ok. The girl ran there too, just to say ""hey, it would be worse if u just ripped ur pants!""... I stood there, just looking at her. I couldn't even say anything, that was just so plain dumb!!!! Then, half hour later, she decides she wants to grab one of our natural juices (carrot, orange and so.. A vitamins thing, my restaurant is all healthy stuff) and she grabs that thing which u use to separate water from tuna (i really don't remember what is it called in English, in Portuguese it is a ""coador""). I asked her why and she tells me she saw a maggot in our oranges and she does that because she is afraid to eat a maggot. That would be ok if a) i wouldn't know that all our fresh products get inspection everyday and if they are not ok, we don't sell them and b) i wouldn't had to wash the thing and it fills all the tiny dishwasher we have there. But it is not the end. A few minutes after this, she needs something from the top shelf and climbs up the cabinet where her glass is. She breaks it and leaves it for me to clean. I did, but after i called her out about leaving the orangey mess for me to clean and that was not my job (i was swamped with dishes in the kitchen, a very messy and busy night). Next day i told the supervisor i was not happy about being a maid to my coworkers and this was not my job. My supervisor was so cool and gave her a rough night that day. Today i am going to work with her... I am dreading the hour.. Every time i work with her i leave work late, like almost 2 am, and when i don't work with her we leave at schedule (00.30h).it is like she uses the restaurant as her personal canteen (she is always eating) and leaving all the work for others. I really don't afford to quit the job, but i am starting to feel nauseous every time is time for me to come here... "

"Yeah. I get where they are coming from too. I feel that there needs to be both perspectives -- that disabled people need to be seen as fully human and not broken. This is the societal aspect, and it affects every disabled person. For some disabled people, this is the sole root of their suffering -- their differences don't cause them intrinsic suffering, it all comes from outside.

But we also need to see and legitimize the suffering that certain conditions can cause in and of themselves. It's okay for a deaf activist to decry the message behind cochlear implants as demeaning (because able-bodied people can be insensitive as fuck, especially when trying to sell things. ""You are broken now, and we can fix you"" *is* a pretty shitty message.) But at the same time, if they rage against *any and all* cyborg tech, not the selling point, but the tech *itself*? (And they do, they so do) It puts down people like me who rely on said cyborg tech to suffer a little bit less.

It's up to me whether I feel like doing something to my own body. Society shapes those feelings, and we should remain aware of that. But other people deciding that you aren't suffering is just as bad as other people deciding you are broken and need fixing. "
"Elitism in metal. With how eager metalheads are to tell everyone about all the elitists, you'd think it was some kind of religion. Even this thread isn't an exception. Ninety percent of the time their definition of elitism is someone that disagrees with them, corrected them when they said something stupid, or listens to a band that they don't know. Funny enough, almost all the elitism in metal seems to come from the same people complaining about it but without the self awareness needed to see they're being hypocrites."

"One time I was at a party with her and her friend. Both got waaaay too drunk. Her friend was so drunk she physically unable to walk, so I ended up putting her arm over my shoulder and we all walked home together. My gf was pissed about that, thinking I should have been giving her that treatment even though she had all her motor abilities intact. She berated me the entire way home about being a shitty boyfriend and eventually threw her drink at me (Malibu and pineapple juice) before storming into her dorm. Even 2 years later, and literally all our friends telling her that was sort of really fucked up, she refused to apologize for it and was convinced that was the right way to behave in that situation. She also slapped me once a few months after we broke up. Basically, I learned that if someone makes you walk on eggshells for fear of upsetting them in the slightest, you should leave.

He was actually the son of a preacher man; a Presbyterian pastor. 
Wonderfully kind man. 
More humble and sweet than Santa. 
And the ""Neurotic Italian mom"", obsessed with evangelism and crafts, 3 adopted kids, one of which is a paraplegic. Great kids. His biological older sister is SUPER sweet... but somehow... he turned out rotten. Cruel... absolutely viscous, paranoid and broken. 
I know he suffers mental illness, as do I, but he's not taking accountability and he's hurting people over and over. He's not seeking help or recovery. 
His exes warned me. (We friends now) 
I warned his current GF after they were both harassing me on Fb randomly. (She's under his spell. I thought he was beautiful. And his good side was so awesome. But so rare.) 

But I'm actually smiling about the nude situation because it's super awkward that I had to print screenshots and copies of the nudes for court evidence. I laugh. Life is weird. Whatever. Modesty. Impermanence. 
My attorney was super awesome tho. We became friends and I had dinner at his house with his cute little family and my husband and I visited Iowa last year and met up to catch up. :) 

As shitty as things can be in life, sometimes it shifts you to a better place to grow and have more opportunities. 

But yes, it was pretty awful at the time. The scariest was when I was locked out of my Facebook for 3 days during this and I couldn't go in and delete posts and check on messages. I still can't access my old gmail.. 
and the other scary part was when he was in court. My attorney gave me rides since I don't have transportation. 
But there he was. Sitting there. That whole court experience is so so strange. 
He got yelled at by the judge for chewing his gum a few times and for speaking out of turn. His dad was with him. ;__; 
Had to do court twice because he asked for a continuance.. and screwed himself by not just accepting the no-contact order, but he fought and got himself a domestic abuse charge! (I didn't want that!) 
but I got to chill with my attorney more. C: 
After we won the trial he got me a book as a gift called ""I Can Pee On This."" (Google knows.) 
And we text occasionally. 

So it's really not that much of a nightmare in the big scheme of things. 
But my lawd, that guy is a dick.

Well done USA, what you manufacture, you apparently do well!

Related, I recently figured something out about why people want us to purchase organic/high quality/ethically...

When we purchase something, we are making a vote for how we want the world to work. When we purchase something from a dollar store that came from a factory in China where kids work 14 hour days for tiny wages, we are voting for that future.

When we purchase exorbitantly priced bakeware from a country that has unions and worker rights and protections, we are voting for that future.

Eventually, the countries that get the most money become more economically powerful and the others have to start either raising their standards (and therefore prices) or lowering them.

Vote too often for the cheapest bidder and eventually the first world countries can't compete unless they reduce their standards - vote often enough for manufacturers that value their workers and eventually those third-world factories will have to start treating their workers better, or go under.

Not everyone has the money to be able to make the choice, but the more people who can, the better."

Does it affect the quality of the movie? No. It's so minor and quick that it doesn't really matter. Does it change how I feel about the movie? No. It's a flawed and slightly run-of-the-mill but overall very fun movie that I like to watch and love the soundtrack. Do I care way too much about this? Absolutely.

"Ugh, I hate to see that a lot of this thread has devolved into petty insults and the like.  I'd honestly consider myself agnostic, after being a Christian for a long time.  I don't disbelieve in a god, but I don't necessarily have any proof of one either.  Thing is, I don't think this makes religion a ""bad"" thing.  Religion has done bad and good, and so has atheism.  I can't deny that religious people have done bad, and that non-religious people have too.

I hate seeing religion hated upon needlessly, though.  Just because someone is a Jew, or a Christian, or a Hindu doesn't automatically make them a close minded idiot.  I hate that bad people masquerading as ""children of *insert god*"" have left a bad taste in so many people's mouths.  

Honestly, for a lot of people, religion is just their way of getting through life.  It helps to have someone who cares about you, even if that person isn't necessarily real.  This isn't an excuse to ignore science, or fear/hate-monger, of course.

Overall, people should just respect each other.  Even if we disagree.  Until someone proves themselves unworthy of said respect, I see no need in attacking them for their beliefs or their lack thereof."

"My family history from what I have seen and heard over my 30 years here has given me a huge insight as to *not what to be*.

I got a huge awakening when I was a young child. My dad was diagnosed with MS before I was born, my mom had a litany of mental health issues I could never begin to understand as a child. They tried their best within the limited capacity they had, and here I am today. I lived through neglect, spite, and a constant need to take care of my father until he passed when I was 17. I learned about really toxic relationships then.

My dad died the day before I was to return to high school for winter break. I was devastated. It wasn't really a shock, as he had endured 21 years since diagnosis, but he was my father. He was a strong willed, amazingly considerate individual who wanted the best for his kids. He wanted to see me graduate. He was my hero. There was no mystery that he was nearing his final days, and we had called his father to let him know.

On the day of my father's death, we phoned my grandfather. He was disgusted with us. Not keeping him on life support (my father asked to NOT be resuscitated or to have life support given), and that we were an abomination to God (neither myself or my mom was catholic). He decided to cut off all communication with the remainder of my family. I told him he was a pathetic coward. That was that.

My mother was emotionally abused as a child. My grandmother always seemed to be in the business of finding a new alcoholic to throw her life at, while neglecting her children in the process. They never had a chance to begin with. There was always a cycle of abuse. It's all my family ever really knew.

I try and distance myself from my family. There are only a few within my bloodline I can truly trust. My sister (who shares a lot of these traits) and my aunt who was in an abusive relationship, and had an opportunity to leave when my mom became ill with alzheimers. She moved in to take care of my mom (I was 19) and developed breast cancer. My mom with her remaining faculties, helped my aunt where she could and in turn my aunt helped my mother. They had a truly loving relationship I cherish to this day, because my mom could never nurture that with me.

She passed away December 22 of last year. She was not a good mother, but she was my mother. And as much as I hated how I grew up, I still love her a lot. She was a terrible mother who didn't know how to love because of the circumstance of her formative years.

I learned that just because they share blood doesn't mean they're family. Family stick together. They try and help each other. They nurture the new generation and help them achieve their goals. My family had next to none of that, and what helps me each and every day is knowing that I don't want to be anything like those selfish, egotistical narcissists.

The real Schindler absolutely was a Nazi. But he was mainly motivated by profiteering rather than truly adhering to all aspects of the Nazi ideology.

"First year of highschool. Within four weeks of school beginning i had fallen into a depression and began developing mental illness issues, got bullied, assaulted and treated like scum for being gay. Most of the school knew and nobody really cared that I was being beat up and told to kill myself. Two suicide attempts when I was 14. One at age 15. Two at age 16. I gave up on being a kid any longer and never got to have fun growing into a teen. I dealt with heavy adult situations like sexual harrasment and suicide really early on

 I'm 17 now, last year of highschool. Feeling much better about my life. Dating a beautiful guy who treats me like a prince. All my friends are 19 or older because I really could not handle the drama of high school friendships. All it is is backstabbing and pathetic drama. "

"She's gone through extensive testing. 
She had seizures for a good 6-7 years straight after that. Grand mal. Eventually they found a medication that worked and she didn't have any for 8 years. She had a drivers license, a car, her own place.

A mild car accident later (whiplash, no airbags) and she's back to having grand mal seizures. She was forced to give up school, her car, her life. She moved back into my moms basement and for 1.5 years went through extensive testing living in a hospital and all that to try and find the root of the issue. No conclusion was ever found.

I still feel like shit about it. My mom tells me it wasn't my fault. But that's probably one of the most vivid memories I have as a child. Seeing my sister clutching the back of her head crying with blood coming down blonde hair and her hands- my mom carrying her home. My mom did take her to the doctor the next day and she had a concussion. I honestly think my mother is protecting me from the truth: that I was the one who caused it. "
"I could see someone being worried that a women would coax a man into sleeping with her so she could fish hook his privates, but I don't think they should be illegal as a self defense items just because a few women might be crazy.

Ditto for someone being shot while breaking and entering. If the man could prove that it was consensual and she shredded his privates under false pretenses, he would probably have grounds for a lawsuit, plus sexual assault charges. If they're breaking into a house or attempting to rape somebody, they probably deserve whatever befalls them.

Ditto for someone being told to come into a house only to be shot, which is probably manslaughter.

The sheer amount of exposure one needs to get all of that right and sound completely natural is staggering; and this has nothing to do with pronunciation or borrowed vocabulary, just regular old grammar."

That's how you know a show has great writing when they can get you to root for the bad guy.

"How is it a draw for the US when they didn't meet their objectives? The goal was the stop the spread of communism in Asia.  At the end of the war, South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were all communist. One of the world's poorest nations made the world's richest nation grow tired of fighting.  Now maybe the spread of communism in Asia was inevitable, but communism was stopped in South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia.  Maybe this is all argument for argument's sake, but the loss of prestige was enormous.  I think what North Vietnam made other developing countries (revolutionary Iran) more willing to push the US."
You in the US? There's absolutely a point in contacting CPS if so. Evidence of drug addiction is one of the easiest ways to substantiate an abuse claim.

"It fits the true goal, though. Which is to show the world that there is a greater power judging them now.

His goal becomes corrupted-- and is pretty villainous in the first place-- but he doesn't intend to just kill every criminal for the rest of time. He wants the world to believe there is someone who will punish them, in order to scare them into complying.

"The feeling of overwhelming panic when the Aurora Theater shooting happened. I was up at one, two in the morning so I got the news very quickly. Only the year before I had been teaching in that district and I knew that my students frequented that theater. 

I called, I facebooked, I texted everyone I knew from teachers to parents to graduates and students themselves, desperate to find out if my kids were okay.

All my students were okay. Not a single one of them was in the theater that night. I did lose a friend from church camp who was there, but my students were all safe. But just that feeling of imagining those bright eyed kids dead in a darkened room was terrifying. "

"Dodging traffic one night trying to rescue a frantic little dog I noticed on my way to work. Watching a car swerve briefly into the turn lane and plow into him with me a few feet away. Watching his little body tumble through the air and feeling his blood rain on me. Driving home in a daze and collapsing on my husband's lap, sobbing. Hearing him sigh and tell me to get over it and I better not use this as an excuse to call off work. Working all night with blood on my shoes that wouldn't come off but I didn't have another pair. Having no one to talk to about it. 

I'm sure many rescuers have seen worse, but this just stayed with me. I had just come back from deployment (National Guard) in a conflict zone where I almost died and some friends didn't make it and was trying to readjust. Unfortunately, it took me many more years to realize what an ass my now ex husband is. 

On Saturday, I woke up at 9pm for work and found my oldest kitty dead. He was 15 and lived a good, long life. Even our vet said he was healthy and spry for his age at his last checkup. I guess, you just wish you could do more, you know? Then when something happens and you have to stuff it down deep inside so it doesn't offend anyone. Then when so much has been squirreled away the pain becomes unbearable, you are told (even by professionals) to grow up and stop living in the past. Except for you the past isn't past - it's right here now and always has been. 

Anyway, I'm sorry to burden you good folks with this, but I greatly appreciate the space."

Turns out, my dad had had an affair with his best friends wife, starting when my mom was 2 months pregnant with me. The affair lasted a few months, until my dad's best friend found out and they were forced to stop. They hid it from my mom for almost 14 years. They also hid the fact that my dad's best friends wife got pregnant by my dad and had kept the little girl. The daughter and I were always close as kids, so to find out she was my half sister was a shock. Me, my mom and dad, half sister and her parents are the only ones who know the truth."

1. puppy mills are very real, and every pet store is guilty of using them.  any breeder that won't give you a tour of their facilities and/or show you the sire/bitch is probably up to something shady.  buyer beware, and always consider adoption.

2.  your breeder is not a fucking veterinarian.  their advice is meaningless bullshit and we don't need their input to treat your pet.

3.  mixed breeds have far fewer genetic disorders, and all things being equal, will typically live longer, healthier lives.

"Just because medical residents have more severe problems doesn't mean u/Twowheelsquiddy doesn't have problems.

I can say a lot of nice things about Japan, like how efficient their work is. But one thing I can say about them, and their similar work hours, is that they do not have work culture. They just have work. When the government has to set limits on how long you can work, there's a problem. And a 14-15 hour work day in western culture? I'm not even going to bother talking about pay or morals, but physically that is detrimental to health. A normal 8 hour work day in an office cubicle or something is already bad, slapping on an extra 6 or 7 hours is just disgusting. Shit has to change."

So basically my grandma cheated on her first husband with my Grandpa. They also had a daughter who ended up being still born before having my mother, but the way the timeline works out I am pretty sure she was conceived before my Grandparents were married. This was never discussed, and by the time I was born was water under the bridge. I mentioned it once when my Grandma was giving me crap for living with my girlfriend. The look on her face was priceless. 

My grandma and her first husband (the one she cheated on) ended up living past both of their spouses, lived in the same nursing home before their deaths, and were good friends."

Meanwhile, there are evil corporate tycoons who have amassed millions in wealth, that they leached from innocent working class people, and do nothing socially uplifting with the money.

Just short of a billion people on this planet who are currently starving to death, meanwhile there are millionaires everywhere spending frivolously on material things."

It's the tube things rodents run through as play toys. In the book he forces one into a girl's cunt and sends a starved rat through it to eat at her from the inside.

However, I did do my homework and figure out what my bank was offering as far as rates  before I went in there, which made for a handy discussion point. 

Never once did we discuss my payment other than the day I was signing the papers and the finance guy said ""this is your payment"". Do the math ahead of time, people. You can find calculators online that factor in your down payment, trade in value, interest rate etc. so your payment won't be a surprise.

I read (IIRC straight from Rowling) that her father worked in Magical Maintenance and she was embarrassed by his low position to the point where she bullied him into retiring and paid him an allowance to basically go away so people wouldn't connect her to him.

I always am hesitant to bring this up because it makes me sound like a 14-year-old edgelord, but Ramsay was my favorite character in all of GoT.

He was a wildcard in the truest sense, and because of that he owned every scene he was in.

Other characters you can kind of know what to expect.  Jon is going to do something honorable.  Littlefinger is going to say something clever and act like a creep.  Tyrion is witty and smart.  But Ramsay was just *crazy,* and every time you thought you'd started to figure him out, he subverted expectation, often in the worst possible way."

And as my PTSD got worse, I eventually had to admit that I had been raped. Which made laughing at Barney Stinson a little tougher. 

When the media paints something serious like this as hilarious with no consequences, it normalizes and possibly encourages the behavior.

All of that being said, I don't take everything seriously and I can laugh. I think It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is fantastic. The gang does really fucked up things. There's jokes about rape and molestation, and I still think it's hilarious. But no one sane comes out of that show thinking ""Wow, I want to be like Dennis!

"You don't need large scale. Organized resistance to wizards is impossible, considering the imperious curse exists and the wizards already have canon access to every world leader (or all the ones that matter), and even if they don't they can instantly teleport to any place they can see, silence and de-odor themselves, obscure themselves with magic and take control of every world leader in a week (or even a single night if they so desired). 

Keep in mind the opening of one of the books, where the Prime Minister of the UK was expecting a call from the President of the US, but since the Wizard Prime Minister wanted to have a chat in that time slot, it was 'arranged' to have that meeting forgotten by the POTUS. 

In universe, there's never any chance at all that muggles beat wizards in a large scale or organized setting. One wizard can have devastating control over the entire world if he so wished and was sufficiently talented and motivated. The British MoM (and presumably all the other wizard governments) already have subversive control over every Muggle government in the world. 

If there was such a war between Muggle and wizards, then the wizards won it a long time ago. There is a witch who purposely got burned at the stake several times for fun."

"If you can keep your head when all about you

are losing theirs and blaming it on you,

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

but make allowance for their doubting too;

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,

Or being hated, don't give way to hating,

And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;

If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;

If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

And treat those two impostors just the same;

If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings

And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

And lose, and start again at your beginnings

And never breathe a word about your loss;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

To serve your turn long after they are gone,   

And so hold on when there is nothing in you

Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   

Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

If all men count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   

Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   

And—which is more—you’ll be a ~~Man~~ *emotionally healthy and well-adjusted individual*, my son!"

"This happened to me recently, except that it was done purposely. I contracted a fairly serious case of gingivitis (thankfully had not progressed to periodontitis) and went for a cleaning. The hygienist explained to me that while I was flossing daily, I wasn't getting below the gumline (no parent, teacher, or dentist ever bothered to tell me this growing up???)  which is why they were infected: tons of plaque had settled between my teeth and gums, causing gum recession. 

So about 75% of my cleaning consisted of the hygienist scraping beneath my gums (and frequently accidentally hitting my poor gums). It was agony. Worse than having the drill used on me, by a mile. I could not hold it together.

That said, I am forever grateful to the hygienist for teaching me how to floss properly and giving me advice on how to heal my case of gingivitis so I never have to endure that again."

"Preventing child abuse and neglect would  have a profound impact on people as they grow into adulthood, helping them to be healthier mentally and physically and more functional as adults.
No one wants to pay for prevention though. 

We need many more support resources for people struggling with mental health problems. Meds and therapy are not all you need to recover. You need friends, structure to your day, a reason to get out and live. Hope to pull yourself out of poverty and achieve more. This also is a chicken and egg issue...are you depressed due to being poor? Or are you poor because you are depressed? Either way, we need more. It would make up for the broken health care system we have now.

Mental health is a spectrum we are all always moving on. Anyone can become depressed, anxious, etc. All that is required is the perfect storm of life stress, genetics and lack of ability to cope.

If you get help, your diagnosis isn't some label everyone will know about. You are not your diagnosis anymore than someone is the flu, cancer or osteoporosis. You can have depression, you are not depression. 

It is possible to recover. It will take work and time but you can do it.

"The goal of analysing a book isn't to find some sort of hidden meaning which the author encoded in the text. This hasn't really been done in literary studies since the 1800s and has been discredited due to ""intentional fallacy"" - assuming you know what the author was doing.

English teachers try to encourage students to find their own meaning in a text. This is an activity which reveals as much about the individual as it does about the text. At a secondary school level, however, students may have trouble interpreting a text for themselves, so a teacher will teach them the most mainstream/canonical interpretation of the book e.g. Of Mice and Men is a critique of the American Dream. This canonical interpretation would have evolved over the history of literary criticism of that text (mostly in the world of academia), and it is important to know the most mainstream/accepted interpretation of a text before you choose to challenge or question it.

As for literal vs. figurative meanings, the two are not distinct. The act of reading itself is a subjective activity as each individual will relate to events differently, understand words differently, connect to some characters more than others."

Also, the exit polls support that late deciders broke for Trump. So it's entirely possible that the polls were correct and that Clinton would still have been favored if every single person was asked 5 days before the election.

Having your prediction not come to pass does not mean your numbers were off. Except for the papers that were going 95%+ for Clinton. That was just nuts."

An over reliance on inductive reasoning is part of the reason that people today seem to 'find' whatever they want to find wherever that want to find it (eg 'There are fascists and racists lurking behind every corner!').  The cure to this is more deductive reasoning; however, that seems to be in very short supply these days. "

"I would never ""act like autism isn't that bad"". I know several high function autists, and a few cripplingly disabled ones. I wouldn't wish low function autism on anyone, but when you talk about a ""cure"", you have to realize that includes ALL persons with ASD. That's where it gets scary. Because that ""cure"" is either eugenics, or abortion. And personally, I'm not cool with ""curing"" the next Einstein or Newton. But that's what a ""cure"" would do. That's why I try to point out that, unlike PTSD, or Depression, there are actually positive effects that it can cause in addition to the detrimental. So, while not all people with ASD get those effects, it certainly has positive effects, and probably shouldn't be blanketly labeled as an illness. It's really more complicated than that."

The other friend decided one day without telling me that he hated me and wanted me to not exist, so he proceeded to fill my best friend's head with bullshit about me. He told him I talked shit about him behind his back. It was a conspiracy to get rid of me. That son of a bitch wanted my best friend all for himself. 

Eventually my best friend just began ignoring me completely. I thought that was weird. We'd known each other since we were 12 and hardly a week went by where we didn't talk. He lives 5 minutes away, so I went over to see what's up after a few weeks of silence. Both of them were there hanging out.

me: ""Uh hey, what's up? This is awkward, but why the fuck are you guys ignoring me? What did I do?""

conspirator: ""You know what you did! You talk so much shit about your best friend behind his back! You're a narcissist!"" 

He then stormed off, got in his car and left before I could call him on his lies.


I managed to explain to my best friend how the other dude tricked him. He didn't seem to be able to fully process it. He was just like ""dang, that's shitty. Oh well."" In no time at all, they were hanging out again.

The part that ended our friendship: He didn't care. He wanted me to get over it and ""solve my problem"" with the fucker that conspired to make him turn on me. I couldn't believe it. He'd rather be friends with a liar.

As long as I had known both of them, I was always honest with them. I had always had their backs and looked out for them. I don't put up with lying or liars.

The shithead that started all of this has a daughter that he never visits and won't pay child support for. I tried to help him out with his child custody situation because I have family that work in the legal field. At every opportunity, he'd neglect to do the right thing. Maybe he decided he hated me because I was a voice of reason that encouraged him to do right by his daughter. Who knows.

Anyway, fuck them both. Being a loner is fine once you get used to it.

Growing up in Australia, basically every movie and tv show we watch is American, almost everything over here is from America, so walking around Beverly Hills and New York City was like a dream. Even simple things like actually SEEING Macy's and Starbucks in real life was so cool. I felt like I was in a movie the whole time. It's hard to explain what it's like growing up in a basic suburb in Melbourne and then being in a place like New York, like you just don't ever think it's something you'd get to do.

"This was in 1998 at a large toy store that has a Giraffe as a mascot. I was doing the seasonal cashier thing for xmas while in school. 

I will never forget this lady. 

3 carts of crap totaling over $5k
4 kids that she let run loose in the store and had to stay away from her the whole time so they wouldn't see the toys. 
17 credit cards!!!!!

She wrote down on the back of an envelope how much to put on what card. 

After all of that she still had a balance of $76.23 so I must have rung everything up wrong. Because she knew what the total was supposed to be. O.o

The manager already seeing the disaster in the making closed my line so I could deal with her. Crazy lazy was going ape shit that I personally was going to ruin Christmas for her perfect angels, the same angels that security had already yelled at multiple times for harassing other customers, destroying displays and screaming that there mother refused to talk to them because they couldn't be near the presents. 

She wanted me to cancel the whole transaction and do it again. I showed her line by line that everything rang up correctly, all the discounts, buy one get ones, coupons, everything worked. 

She didn't believe me or the manager, she wanted it canceled and to start over. I explained multiple times that canceling the transaction may not remove the hold from her credit cards. 

Guess what??

Tried to ring it through again and the credit cards start declining....

She was into a rage that has still left my ears ringing to this day. 

Cops were called when she threatened to go out to her car and get her gun if we didn't fix it right now so her perfect angels could have the Christmas they deserve. 

Somehow I think she got the Christmas she deserved, I hope the kids grew up better than her and I quit that night. "

"I grew up in New Mexico and Arizona with an incredibly racist mother. She hated ""Indians"" (Native Americans) because they ""get drunk all the time and contribute nothing to society"". She hated black people for being thugs, and she hated ""All Mexicans"" (read: anyone with a slightly darker complexion than very white, but lighter than black) for being ""illegals"" here to take jobs and make drug gangs and traffic good white women back to mexico.

So I grew up with this mentality. The only thing I didn't believe was that gay people would go to hell. Because I also had a thing for kids of the same gender and well my mom couldn't be perfect right?

I cringe thinking back on a rant I went on in my freshman year of college about Native american peoples. I had moved to Seattle of all places, and was not very popular because of said rant. 

Over the course of the next 3 years I learned a lot about diversity. And about how my mother was an aweful person. And about opening up to myself and accepting who I was (gay and trans, which I'd been secretly going to therapy for for years.) I got involved in sex positive culture groups, experimented in a poly relationship that went extremely well for a while. I made lots of friends of various ethnic backgrounds and dropped my highly christian religion. In my mother's eyes, college turned me into a horrible godless monster. We don't talk anymore."

Force two kids who are mad at each other together and they will start hitting each other. Separate them for a day and they will come back forgetting the whole thing. 

Setting an arbitrary time you have to settle a conflict so you can get a good night's rest creates tension and grumpy people who will just make things worse. Go to bed, if it's still an issue in the morning talk about it then with a calmer head now that you've both had time to think it through. "

"&gt;  very little scholarships available for an average white guy to go to college

As a white dude that worked in higher ed for many years after graduating, let me clear up some misconceptions:

a) Scholarships typically are either academic merit-based, athletic-based, need-based, or provided by individual groups. White students have just as much an opportunity to get 3 of those as non-whites. The only one that tends to favor minorities is scholarships given by individual groups.

b) Many public schools offer substantial discounts for in-state students that test well and/or have a high GPA. This is a colorblind process in many states

c) Many private schools offer larger scholarships than public schools, which means that in many cases a private college can be cheaper than public school.

I dig that you're into the whole MAGA thing and being concerned about the plight of us white folk, but really, it's fine. There is plenty of money to go around if you're not a total dufus. My GPA was somewhere in the 3.2 range for HS and I still got a 50% scholarship to a good private college."
"He turned a bit crazy when his spouse died. His earlier work was pretty *en pointe,* though:

&gt; The importance of these findings is that they contradicted both the traditional pedagogic advice of limiting or avoiding bodily contact in an attempt to avoid spoiling children, and the insistence of the predominant behaviorist school of psychology that emotions were negligible. Feeding was thought to be the most important factor in the formation of a mother–child bond. Harlow concluded, however, that nursing strengthened the mother–child bond because of the intimate body contact that it provided. He described his experiments as a study of love. He also believed that contact comfort could be provided by either mother or father. Though widely accepted now, this idea was revolutionary at the time in provoking thoughts and values concerning the studies of love."

"Its extremely complicated. Japanese culture is extremely shame based, as you noticed. The thing is, this means there is intense pressure for men to be successful. A man can't get married in modern society until he has an education and a good paying job. The thing is, acquiring these things is very difficult, and Japanese culture puts intense pressure on its people to succeed. People work 18 hr days all the time, and then go out drinking in order to maintain social standing in the office. Somehow, despite this insane work load, men are expected to also find time for dating. 

Now, that might be a little bit easier if women were all content to be little house wives of men who work 18 hrs and then go out drinking. Most of them aren't. Women are now entering the work force, going to university, etc. They're applying the same rigor to their lifestyles. In the midst of all of this, people are expected to date, get married, have children? Yeah right. 

Furthermore, no one will even consider you if you don't have a good job or good education. This is why we have so many people who have given up on sex, or even leaving their room. They are so ashamed of their failures that it would be better for the world to pretend they don't exist.

"&gt; Mussolini and Hitler were socialists

Hitler was *not* a socialist. Goebbels was one, but not Hitler. The points and name of the Nazi party were just included to appeal to every social class at once – this is supported by the fact hat Hitler tried to win over large industries for the party to get funds. Those were mostly put off by the ""sozialismus"" part, thus most of the funds came from medium sized companies. 

The party had indeed a left wing at first (and received a big liftoff after the recession, claiming ""financial judaism"" to be the origin) which split off later – among them politicians like Otto Strasser –  but what remained, especially Hitler, was not socialist. The party had programs like the *Nationalsozialistische Betriebszellenorganisation* for factory workers, and the *Nationalsozialistischen Kampfbund für den gewerblichen Mittelstand* for small shop owners, and when meeting industrials they claimed to be anti class struggle and anti-democracy. Hitler always remained cloudy as to what would happen after the Machtergreifung and tried to be as inconclusive about his party's alleged socialism as possible.

Socialism is based on class while National-socialism was based on race.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Father's day. My grandfather went for a walk and never returned. He has been missing since. No trace of him anywhere. It has destroyed my family. It was on a Monday. My mother let my sister and I stay home from school. We had just visited him on Sunday. I was nine. I didn't fully understand what happened for some time. But when It did dawn on me it sent me down a path of depression and suicidal thoughts. I started to eat my feelings. Gained a lot of weight. Mother turned to harder drugs. We eventually moved back to my home town to be with my grandmother. God rest her soul. She was married to him for seventy something years and passed without ever knowing what happened.

"The initial claim was that a company would appear that only hired women for slightly higher than the market was paying and would then outcompete the other companies who are underpaying women. This is a gross oversimplification. Markets are not perfect, for one. A new company going into an industry has barriers of entry that may be too high to be offset by the slight bump in hiring cheaper labor. Another fact is simply that companies *can* do things that are not optimal and get away with it. Think about the company you work in. I'm sure there are parts of it that you think are mismanaged and wasteful. Yet, your company still exists and may even be thriving.

On top of that, you kind of ignore the basis of the question, which is whether this is fair. Maybe some of the wage premium that men get over women is that men are just better at working with other men over women. As a result, women are handicapped because of sexism, although you could argue that their return to the company is lower. Is that fair?"

"Well, maybe thats what the filters do, just take out the weaker species that couldnt survive. We have gotten to the point as a civilisation that the weakest members of our species can survive, however are we done? Very unlikely. The next filter we hit might be super bugs, if the filter lets us through we survive. If not, then humanity is killed by the super bugs. Or the next filter could be something to do with space such as what wiped out the dinosaurs or the big gamma ray that might potentially destroy us completely. The list seems endless.

The reason I interpreted it as any number of filters ahead of us is because i'm imagining each filter as an event. For example, the dinosaurs were wiped out because of an asteroid, and that event was a filter and they didn't make it. The final filter for us should be the sun dying and wiping us out, but what if we master space travel? Then we face new 'filters' on the new planet, and this carries on until we are wiped out, but that could take 100000 filters, or it could take 1 more"

"Basically we weren't taking advantage of any of the web parts. Every page was the blank content template, and we were using html to display documents and stuff for each product and manually linking them from a document library, and also each product had its own subsite. This was stupid, it would have been roughly 1000% easier to group the products together based on type (we were a medical company so all knee stuff goes here, all hip stuff goes here, etc.), add some metadata to the library, throw up a web part, and filter it based on the metadata. It also would've helped out a lot with search, which also wasn't set up properly although that wasn't our fault because at the time i had super user access and not full central admin access

also we were using a different css in the assets library of each product and linking it from a content editor web part so that we could gussy things up. This was dumb. Much easier to register the css file in the masterpage and sort it out from there to make sure it was used all through the site. That way when there were changes there was only one file to change, instead of a billion for each product. "

- I could have a list of 10 chores to have completed by the time that parent was home. If I only managed to complete say 9 out of the 10 in that time line, it was a rampage of yelling and stomping about how I wasted my time and didn't complete the list.

"(NSFL) My wife was going through her 3rd miscarriage a little less than half way through her pregnancy. We needed to recover the fetus to get it genetically tested to help us figure out why we were miscarrying so many times. The miscarriage process itself was a 24-hour process of my wife going through turmoil and sifting through what was coming out for the fetus. About hour 14 our restroom looked horrific, like a Tijuana abortion clinic. While she was sleeping/recovering from 14 hours of pain, I scrubbed down the bathroom removing all traces of blood (and cleaned the strainer) so as to give her peace for when she resumed her miscarriage. 

We found out the baby was a genetically normal girl, so we never learned why we miscarried so many times. Good news is that we've since had a very healthy daughter. My wife has thanked me several times over the years for that quiet act of service, done at one of her most difficult days. "

"I was never a racist, but did hold preconceived stereotypes/notions. Until I met my boyfriend. He's black. I'm white. 
We were both in college and athletes. We were at an athletic banquet of sorts and I guess I caught his eye. He pursued me for a while, even reaching out to my roommates to get a hold of me. Now, it wasn't the fact he was black that made me resist him. I just didn't want a boyfriend. point blank. Finally, I decided to go on a date with him as he was genuinely sweet and persistent and attractive as hell. All I can say is wow. I had an entirely different picture about who this guy was. I allowed the fact that he's black, covered in tattoos, plays basketball and from Brooklyn to paint an image in my head about who he was/is. Embarrassing. But it did teach me a great lesson about not judging books by their covers. 
Anyway, long story short, we're going on 6 amazing years now! Both of our families welcome us in with loving arms which we are truly blessed to say.  Even my grandparents genuinely love him and ask about him constantly/follow his basketball career. Seeing as my great grandfather was part of the Kkk, I am so proud of my grandparents that they had an open mind and formed their own thoughts. 

Conversely, we have received a fair share of flack regarding our relationship. The first year we were together, it hit us like a freight train. My boyfriend led his team to win the NCAA tournament and along the way our relationship was momentarily thrust into the national spotlight. The online hate was inhumane and disgusting. We were both receiving criticism for dating each other. If we posted a picture of us together online, we were instantly swarmed with nasty comments. I could not believe it. It got so nasty, university officials had to ask if we were okay. Funny, the audacity of people behind a computer screen."

"I was with an alcoholic abusive girlfriend for several years.  We met in high school, she had a rocking body and best ass ever so it definitely helped keep me hooked on her.  She would drink nearly every weekend, like Friday to Sunday nonstop and would start really shitty arguments with me over my choice of friends, music, food, clothing, tv show, video game preference you name it and then once the argument was in full swing she would throw shit, kick me, bite me, punch me, break stuff at our house, storm out and go walking through the streets at 2 AM shit drunk and then come home barefoot and freezing at 5AM... ya that kinda shit.   

I somehow was the sap that always forgave her, with a cut on my forearm and gash in my forehead I would take her back in after she apologized.  We talked about getting her help with her anger when drinking or to stop drinking altogether, she didn't want anything to do with it.   Keep in mind this wasn't like every single week, more episodic and bimonthly if anything so it was hard to fault the good parts with the drunken bad.    She kind of made the decision to leave for me one night though, got drunk, she broke some glass and cut herself, I tried to stop her from leaving in the middle of the night in December.  She struggled with me and was either trying to hit me or push me really hard but I grabbed both of her arms as hard as i could and held her down, to which she kicked and bit me and got free.  She took off running down the street at 1:30 AM in 22 degree weather police picked her up about an hour later sitting near a crosswalk shivering, in pajamas and bleeding from her feet and hands and crying.. oh and she had bruises on her wrists from me grabbing her arms to stop her.  Police knock on my door, immediately handcuff me and read me my rights.  She had sold them this cockamamie bullshit story about how we were drinking together, I then tried to have sex with her and she said no... so she tried to leave and thats when i grabbed her and broke the glass tackling her or some shit... UN FUCKING REAL.    I went to jail that night, lawyered up, paid my bail and as soon as i got my belongings back I have a text from her saying: 

&gt;""Oh my god I am so sorry about last night, are you okay?""

Needless to say my reply was quick, to the point, and very direct.  Never saw her again, I actually packed her shit in my truck that day and dropped it off in her parents driveway.  Also for those wondering, through the courts I was vindicated as she gave 4 different accounts of what happened to different officers, they all noted that she was heavily intoxicated in their reports and she failed to do any followup interviews with detectives.  "
I’m so sorry this happened to you. I really hope you are in a better place now. I read the full story and it was pretty heartbreaking and it got to me. Hope you are ok.
"I want to add something to this that a lot of people seem to leave out.  Health issues include mental health and some mental disorders such as depression, binge eating disorder, and others result in overeating.  Hell, some health incidents result in mental health issues.  My father-in-law broke his leg and couldn't get out of bed except for therapy and gained 12 pounds because he was depressed and sat in the bed and ate junk.

"Basically the mental map of their body has errored and their physical body no longer matches the map, so the limb that's missing from the map feels wrong, alien, heavy, and just Needs To Go. It's almost the exact opposite of phantom limb disorders, where a person's mental map of their body is still whole but a limb is missing, resulting in false sensations and tension from a limb that does not exist to send any nerve impulses (often the map is 'locked' with the missing limb in a painful state) 

In both cases, the solution is to try and realign the two, first through various therapies to try and fix the mental map (mirror box therapy is the iconic/well known one for phantom limb, even though it's nowhere near reliable) and ultimately through amputation and augmentation respectively.     "

"This is completely insensitive. A baby isn't like a dog where you go and pick a new one up from the Humane Society a week after your elderly pet dies (and even then lots of people can't bring themselves to get a new pet immediately). Could you remarry six months after your spouse died, or embrace a new stepparent in the same time? You may think these examples are different since the baby hadn't been around for years and you have no shared memories, but you'd be wrong. Expectant parents often hope and dream about who their child may be, even before they become pregnant. The baby kicks and moves, she has music preferences and you attribute your food aversions and cravings to what the baby likes. Also, for the mother, she is in 24/7 physical contact with that child the entire pregnancy. If you added up every hug or touch you had with your spouse, it wouldn't add up to the amount of physical contact you have with your unborn child -- touch is what bonds babies to parents and is the foundation for secure attachment.

In addition to the emotional, there's the physical. Depending on how late the miscarriage happened, a woman's body may have had a full labor and delivery. Pregnancy itself is certainly hard on the body; the process that prepares the body for delivery doesn't just snap back into place like a new rubber band. Depending on how awful her morning sickness, fatigue, insomnia, constipation, heart burn, pelvic pain, acne and/or swollen feet might have been, she may not want to jump back aboard that train right away. She probably has post-partum depression that could take months or even years to resolve itself (mine lasted three years!). She could have had fertility issues and trying again means more rounds of clomid, hormone injections, surgery, or in vitro fertilization. Even if the couple can afford these treatments, they're often emotionally exhausting and they may well want a break.

In addition to all this that may be happening to one member of this family, figure the exact same thing is happening to their spouse *and* their children. My daughter is four and we've had to explain to her that she wasn't getting the baby brother or sister she was hoping for. I imagine if I was further along or my daughter was older, she would grieve the loss of a sibling as well and may also be reluctant for us to try again.

To sum up: babies aren't products your order up on Amazon, where if it gets waylaid in shipping, the sender can send you another -- no biggie. It's emotionally, physically and financially draining to prepare for an addition to any family, and to dismiss these considerations out of hand indicates a level of insensitivity -- or a lack of empathy. Seriously, this was something you could have thought through yourself."

"This is the first time I've come across someone on the wwws talking about DP/DR in real time!! Not just on 5 yr old forum posts. I haven't had an episode in almost two years now, which is fortunate. I still get tastes of it however, and the ""memories"" I have of severe episodes will stay with me for fucking ever. I like th fact that you used these guys -""- around the word 'myself''. Whenever I have spoken about it in the past, or written about how I am feeling I use a lot of speech marks or find a verbal equivalent. Cos it's just so fucking hard to find the right words or even sentences to explain any of it. Anything I've been able to formulate to describe how I process my surroundings, my self, my physical body, other people, the world, the air, and objects during an episode is always full of ""it's sort of like xyz, but also zyx, but not not really zyx, but at the same time absolutely zyx"". How difficult it is to try and cope with something, when you can't even describe to yourself what the actual things you're experiencing are at any given time, let alone your psychologist. And to add to the difficulty, the way that you're experiencing reality and the self is consistently shifting. One minute you don't feel like you're real, the next minute you're watching yourself. An hour later the air is viscose and you're a character in a book- then all of a sudden your skin is not quite attached to you, it's floating or being held on by Velcro, and everything in the environment around you is in high def, ever so slightly over saturated and sort of.. shimmering. Then BAM ""reality"" hits and every building and tree is flat. 2 dimensional props looming over you, and your skins back on but this whole body of flesh and the mind that exists within it arnt attached to each other and I don't think... that they even belong to me? 
Something that's always confused me is that sometimes during an episode id have a little taste tester of starting to feel slightly ""in touch"" with reality again, and it would scare the shit out of me. For just that moment,I wouldn't want to leave whatever realm I was. Even though I hated every second of it, and would constantly fiend to feel ""normal"" again, even though I was scared anxious and depressed- when faced with the ""option"" of returning to reality I'd right freak out. I guess when you live somewhere for so long it becomes home. Or it's like some inertia shit. Of course, in hindsight I didn't actually have the option of just ""snapping back"" to reality anyway... I sort of feel like that's a trick a lot of mental illnesses play on you. Making you feel like its your friend, And the world would actually be bleaker or scarier or whatever without it,  and you have the choice to have it as your friend or not- and look! You've chosen it!

"It's basically him conducting a social experiment, manipulating a manager at a fast food place to keep his female employee in his ""custody"" and strip search her because a ""cop"" told him to over the phone. Then he kidnaps Olivia and tries to make Elliott do something (I forget what) or he's going to continue to electrocute her. It ends up being fake and is based on the Milgram experiments, and he gets away at the end. "

"Yes! By pretending Nazis are just cartoon villains, you are ignoring your responsibility to fight against extremism. Nazis were people. They had hopes, dreams, desires, and families. Their lives, although more by their own doing, were still brutally taken from them and ruined in order to advance the agenda of a selfish madman.

Instead of demonizing extremist (left wing, right wing, religious, etc), I believe it is better to address their concerns and worries, see why they would be driven to these thoughts, and show them why their ideology, not they themselves, are bad. 

Equally, its not healthy to portray all Allies as blanket good guys. Just like Germans, most were normal people simply fighting for what they believe is right, but, when you put humans in a meat grinder defined by the mantra ""kill or be killed"", people do things they would never normally do (trust me, as a Vietnam vet I know all about this). This doesnt condone their behavior or make it right, but by understanding they you and your side are not perfection, its easier to understand and address your own flaws, as an individual or as a country.

"Lol goddamn that's a big jump you made. Either you haven't seen the movie so you have no idea what we're all referencing, or you're desperate to make yourself look like a victim because mean people described a fictional rapist's actions. 

Spoiler alert, in the movie he was absolutely a rapist who had imprisoned his own daughter for years in an underground bunker and had kidnapped the main character to presumably do the same thing. Him being clean-shaven doesn't have anything to do with it, but him murdering the only other person/male that the main character knew and then trying to make himself attractive to her is what leads us to that character conclusion. They could have shown Goodman putting on a nice shirt, brushing his teeth, tidying his bedroom or spritzing cologne and it would have had the same effect."

"I think the issue here is only that Walter is a villain to his family and Jesse, and maybe Mike.

But with everyone else, he's only truly a villain to a bunch of other villains. They all do wrong. He just does wrong back to them. Especially when he feels like his life is on the line.

I mean, think about how you may have sympathized with Hector for being ceremoniously tortured at the thought that his kids were dying as well as the cartel, and he could do nothing about it. Was Gus the villain? Or was Hector? Both are villains and we just choose to sympathize with those who aren't in the wrong at the time. Walter dispatching both was simply a power move. He took all competition out of his way and was able to continue with business. The only people dead being villains too.

His family, and Jesse never died. Mike did, unfortunately. But the issue with Mike was that he was also involved and villainous. Just smart.

Ultimately, again, Walter was killing other villains while mentally/emotionally straining his family/Jesse. That strain, of course, is what makes him their villain. "

"It's even more convoluted when you don't interpret it literally because then it all kinds of problems to make excuses for. For example, Yahweh is completely absent from everything for all of human history, watching civilizations around the world worshipping other gods, then he suddenly pops up in Israel as part of the Canaanite pantheon, and he isn't even the chief god among them. He's just a national god, with a wife and everything. Then a few centuries later, he completely changes and decides that he is the best god, and you shouldn't worship those other gods, but kill all of their followers. A while after that he changes even more, and decides that he is the one and only god and insists he created the world. Then he adds this story about first humans that never existed, and how they defied him and that makes all mankind guilty of sin, due to an event that is metaphorical. Then he decides to incarnate in a remote region and never bother even writing anything down, despite his own worshippers having a written language, and insists that this human incarnation of himself is literally descended from more people who were metaphorical. And don't forget that he repeatedly asserts that anyone who doesn't believe it all is an ignorant fool who can do nothing but evil."

"But as an adult, he certainly wouldn't believe that-- or couldn't reasonably believe that.  Either he is so narcissistic that he does genuinely think he's a victim-- in which case his inaccurate account doesn't make sense-- or he is merely playing the victim in another manipulation round with Jessica, this time without using his powers.  It's a classic abuser tactic, making oneself out to be a victim to garner sympathy.  Even if we do think he genuinely believes he's a victim, then we still are not supposed to believe that it is reasonable for him to believe this.  This in contrast to Jessica's best friend, who was abused by her mother, and is dealing with the trauma gradually. "

"Two points:

1. You know that humans aren't the only ones that enjoy altering their consciousness with chemicals, right? Elephants love them some alcoholic fermented fruit. Dolphins are known to chew puffer fish to get high.

2. Even if you are doing something that is ""fun"" it is all just ""chemicals"" altering your mood. Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, etc. If you do anything for a thrill like skydiving, parkour, or sex for pleasure, you are altering your mood with chemicals. There is fundamentally no difference in doing it with drugs because most of those drugs attach to the same neuroreceptors that the other, brain manufactured, chemicals attach to. Hell, the strongest hallucinogen known to man, Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), is produced naturally in our pineal glands and is known to release naturally when humans approach death (or have a near death experience).

I guess the real question is have YOU ever had fun?

"too much is assumed. 

Lets put it right: There is learning english, and there is learning rnglidh on a conversational level. 

it starts with the lack of gendered words (habit for a german), and then continues with the huge proportion of to memorize words. Then, you have a habit of punning, which complicates something the average american barely understands him or herself for the person going to learn the language. 

It is just assumed that you know so much, and take it in exatly the correct way. 

Foir example: 

German: I want to see the new transformers movie, I 'm going to the cinema tonight. 

Ich will den neuen Transformers film sehen, ich geh heute noch ins kino. 

English: I'mma go see that new transformers movie tonight. 

Mind you, at first, if you start at 0, english is really easy to learn to become functional. You can understand it really quick, because lets be honest, most americans don'rt spoeak that masterfull of an english as well.

The Russians had *so much* equipment. About 35 million Mosin Nagant rifles (the standard rifle of the USSR) were produced before and during WW2. This is almost three times the number of K98 (standard German rifle) were produced. 

The USSR produced 30 thousand light tanks, 76 thousand medium tanks, and 13 thousand heavy tanks over the course of the war. Germany produced 50 thousand tanks total, most of which were Panzer III and Panzer IV models, which were completely obsolete in the latter years. 

The USSR produced 160 thousand aircraft, while Nazi Germany produced 120 thousand. 

The USSR outproduced Nazi Germany by a factor of three, which is not surprising, given that it was a much larger and much more populous country.

The only people who have the power to do something meaningful are government and corporations.

Look at France. The government outlawed throwing edible food away (supermarkets mainly). They have to give it to charity now. As a result, they don't waste as much. It's a brand new law and the effects are not yet felt, but if things keep going the way they are, less waste = less food to order = less production or more export to other places. And locally, it's great for the poorest class.

But ultimately it is also the responsibility of corporations. They are responsible for not putting the deformed or bruised vegetables on sale. Nobody else is taking that decision for them. Business always like to pretend they are justified to fuck things up and then always pretend it shouldn't be their responsibility to clean it up.

It's a cultural problem. And people like you telling other people they have  some sort of power over it are missing a big part of how the world works."

A major bit of propaganda that *everyone needs to know* is that the US does *not* have too many lawsuits. We do have a problem in that there are too few.

Think of the disdain most people feel when they hear about someone suing another, against the person bringing suit. That wasn't around 15 years ago, not as strong. It's been built up by everyone who stands to lose a lot: doctors, corporations, rich people.

They've put it out there that we are sue happy and have made tort compensation much harder to pursue. The worst area is probably in medicine, where malpractice is almost impossible now unless they chop off the wrong arm, but it affects us everywhere. It costs us money, hurts our health, and literally kills us.

Think about who you hear complain most about lawsuits. Really think about it. Trump is up there, who suffers from thousands of lawsuits for failing to pay and breaking contract, legitimate lawsuits. Doctors talk about it a lot. CEOs talk about it. But not everyday people, except in that passing disdain."

Joe shows up to Sally &amp; Sam's house with a gun &amp; tells Sam to get out. Sam runs away, but doesn't call the cops because he's wanted by police himself. Sally is stuck in the house with gun-wielding Joe for a few hours. Joe eventually gives up &amp; leaves. Sally continues her relationship with Sam, even though he completely bailed &amp; left her helpless. Sally gets pregnant YET AGAIN &amp; breaks up with Sam.

Sally starts dating Joe again (crazy gun guy) and they both claim that he is the father of her unborn baby. They get married. They buy &amp; wreck multiple vehicles, lose multiple jobs. Joe already has 4 kids, so together they have 8-10. Sally moves a lot &amp; makes her school-aged kids switch schools multiple times.

I missed a divorce &amp; at least one more kid in there somewhere, but who's counting?

"That's really a surface reading of feminism and an inability to empathize. Here is something to think about:
* What women do or do not with their genitals is up to them. The reasons they do it is also up to them. If some of them believe it is because of the ""patriarchy"", it's their point of view. You are free not to believe in it just as they are free to believe it.
* My guess is that you are a white male who has always been told that things are equal for everyone. No doubt, in your experience, things have been equal. You got promoted because you worked hard and deserved it. You studied hard and made it through school. Or whatever. How about a woman who takes a job that is equal to what a man in the same department is doing, same title, and hired about a month apart? This happened to my wife and we became friends with the guy and his family. A few years later, we found out she was offered about 25% less than he was. It's academia and they were both hired as associate professors in the same discipline.
* A hallmark of privilege is the need to dictate to others how they should experience the world. That, in a nutshell, is your rant about feminism.
* A direct and tangible result of feminism is that more women are enrolled in college than men in the US. Another is that more and more girls are taking a liking to science, engineering, robotics, mathematics, etc.

I am not a woman but I can empathize with them, probably because I am a minority male who has experienced pretty much the same in my career and life. And I have also had many people try to tell me how to experience the world. If I was not twice as intelligent and driven to work twice as hard as my colleagues, I would not have the position I have now. 

So, excuse me if I don't buy what you're trying to sell up there. Walk a mile in someone else's shoes before telling them that the stink from under their soles is not really dog doo doo."

As I was educating my mom regarding it, she disclosed to me that my name or fairly the vast majority of Sikh names are Unisex, for the straightforward reason that in principle we don't recognize our youngsters premise on sex. As the two men and ladies should be made equivalent in GOD's eyes. Sex is recognized by Kaur (Meaning Princess) or Singh (Meaning Lion) as a center name.

"The VIPs are, in my opinion, a scam. I work in the court system and MADD has lobbied prosecutors so successfully that every DUI offender must attend a VIP. That fact is fine with me though. It is the actual VIPs that bother me. First, MADD charges for them, so there's a huge monetary incentive at play as they pack dozens or hundreds of people into each one. Second, of the hundreds of people I've spoken to who have attended a VIP, they have uniformly said the program was poorly run, disorganized, the speakers were rarely victims of DUI themselves (meaning neither them nor their loved ones were in DUI accidents). I've attend a few myself as part of job and those people were right. At least in my area. The VIPs are on autopilot and they aren't helping anyone. 

There are good ways to reduce DUI recidivism, VIP panels isn't one of them, in my experience. Like divorces, where I live most people do not reoffend after a first offense DUI. Some do but the vast majority do not. Yet MADD wants everyone treated like a career criminal. There are people who should be punished with jail and license revocations but a first offense DUI with a low BAC can happen to literally anyone who has wine with dinner, even a glass or two. 

I'll share one other story from my career that makes me very, very skeptical of MADD. A man was arrested for DUI with injury after he lost control of his car and hit pedestrians on a sidewalk. MADD showed up to his court appearance, jeered at him while he walked through the hallways, and said awful things about him on the local news. The problem? His blood came back completely clean. There was no alcohol or drugs in his system. As best we can tell, he had a seizure. Did MADD ever apologize to him? Did they ever retract the awful things they said about this guy? Not a chance. The mere allegation was enough for MADD to condemn him, the evidence be damned. The situation reminds me a lot of President Trump and the Central Park Five, actually. 

MADD may do wonderful things for victims, ill take your word on that, but they also go too far in other areas. "

"I walked by a guy shooting up heroin on the San Antonio boardwalk. I was twelve and with my family. He noticed us to late and tried to hide it, but the needle was already in his arm. Later when we were on the other side of the river, we saw him tripping balls. He was shouting at the wall and just raving at nothing. It was pretty sad. This was a far more effective tool then D.A.R.E. to persuade me to not do drugs."

"Yeah. Mine comes with serious pain and I'd get rid of it in a heartbeat. 

Just to be clear, I don't understand the sentiment coming from any community but the deaf. There will always be fringe people who have their identity intertwined with their disability, but I think the vast majority would jump at any solution that helps us out and let's us live a better day-to-day life.

Edit: That said, I know people who have painful disabilities who say they wouldn't want to go back in time and prevent it, because it made them the person they are. I just don't know if I have any friends who would say they wouldn't get rid of it *now* given the option. Though, as I said, I'm sure there is someone on the fringe somewhere who would say that."

"I've seen a rat show remorse too, when my (ex)wife and I were keeping a pair as pets.

We tended to give them old shoeboxes, because those created caves AND gave them something to chew on.  However, one of the rats got overambitious.  He'd chewed a hole through the box wall and tried to go through it, but because he was a porky little thing, he got himself stuck seesawing back and forth without either set of legs able to get enough leverage to push himself through.

And he started freaking the fuck out, thrashing around so hard I was afraid he was going to break his back or something.  I had a pair of scissors, and could cut him out in seconds, but I didn't want to use them with him thrashing around so badly.  After a moment's thought, I realized what I had to do: I stuck a finger in his mouth.  He bit down, the thrashing stopped momentarily, and I went snip-snip.  One rattie saved.

But here's the funny thing.  He ran to the back of his cage and started acting like he was scared of me, even dodging an attempt to pick him up for a snuggle.  Finally, after a lot of coaxing, he climbed slowly onto my hand... then immediately grabbed the bitten finger and started licking/cleaning the wound like crazy. He knew *exactly* where he had bitten me, and despite the circumstances, he clearly felt bad about it!

But I scratched him behind the ears and everything was cool again."

"What's the best thing about Switzerland? I don't know, but their flag is a huge plus."
"My parents are Indian, but I was born and brought up in the USA. If you check my passport, my nationality is ""USA"". 

I studied in the US from pre-school till 6th grade. After my dad got involved in politics, I moved to India and went to middle school and high school there. It was an international school so everyone was from out of the country, and it didn't really feel like I was in India. 

Anyways, after high school, the plan was to go to college in the US and I got admission into a university in Virginia. I was thrilled, as that's where I was born and brought up. 

Upon coming to Virginia, I realized things were a lot different. For one, I was just ""the Indian kid"" who would be at the end of stereotypical jokes - which was fine. That's not really what bothered me. What bothered me was the way that I was treated by my RA's and the police. I don't even know where to begin.

Our hallway had about 15 kids and I was the only brown kid - all the other kids were white. It would be Friday night and everyone in the hallway would be playing music in their rooms. Seeing how every one else was playing music and the RAs seemed fine with it, I'd also play music. However, id often have my door knocked with an RA yelling at me turn down my music. It was weird because everyone else would be blaring theirs. I didn't understand why I was getting singled out, so I just complied. Eventually it started getting worse. They started threatening to call the police if I didn't turn down my music, and on one occasion, an RA even locked me out of my room and said I had to pay $100 to get back in. I waited until 3AM outside my room for my roommate to come back and let us in (my key was literally on my desk inside). 

Another time there was a kid who smoked weed in the hallway, and the RA called the cops and told them it was me. The whole building fucking reeked, yet the police came to my room and as soon as they opened the door they said they could smell it on my breath. They went on and on about how ""they know tons of kids like me who think they can come to a new country like America and do whatever they want"". That's when I knew things REALLY weren't what they were like when I was a kid. Maybe I was sheltered as a kid and never had to face racism. But that day I did, and it really, really hurt. The cops searched my room, found a bunch of lose tobacco and 3 stems of weed, so they confiscated it as evidence and they gave me my ticket which told me the day I had to go to court. 

That fucked me up for a long time. I went into a kind of depression where I'd drink like never before. I had the cops called on me several times after because I'd have my music on, but I'd just be too drunk to care. I couldn't believe that all these kids were having so much fun and doing so well while I was dealing with the police on a regular basis. I graduated at the top of my class in high school and even got the presidential award for educational excellence, but I guess none of that really mattered at the end. I was banned from my dorm hall for life. I had to find an apartment during my first year and move out. I'm not a big cryer, but I haven't cried like that before in my life, and I think the only time I'll cry like that again is when a family member passes. 

I eventually left that uni and decided never to come back. That was the last time I stepped food in VA and I don't have any plans to return. I've been denied apartments because of the 3 stems the police found, and my life has pretty much been total shit since then. I'm kinda starting to get back into the groove, and I've been trading stocks to support myself since I'm too scared to apply for a job and get rejected cause of my charges. 

This is probably the most racism I've ever experienced. "

"This isn't a plot hole. This is just why Luke is a _really shitty_ ~~character~~ person.

So, Star Wars nerd rant on: 

He _was_ there for only a week or two. He gets it in his head that he has to go confront Vader, because _Vader_ manipulates him into it, and Yoda tells him not to. Hell, remember the cave? That shit was Yoda saying: ""if you go, you're going to fall to the dark side"". Luke, being the fucking know-it-all that he is goes anyway. This destroys Obi-wan and Yoda's plans for him eventually forcing him to face Vader in RotJ significantly unprepared.

Which leads us to the ""Shadows of the Empire"" timespan between Empire and Jedi. 2 Years, I think, is the accepted time span between the two movies. Luke goes into hermitage on Tattooine, primarily consulting with Obiwan's force ghost on how to build his lightsaber. He'd be able to train a little bit, but it's pretty clear that Yoda is blowing smoke up his ass when he says ""your training is complete."" Luke gets _fucking lucky_ in his confrontation with Vader -- which is hilarious, because in Star Wars ""there's no such thing as luck.""

For one more reason to hate Luke - watch Rogue One. Blue squadron? There's a reason we've never heard of Blue Squadron. They get fucking destroyed under the shield. Red 5 though? Red 5 is lost in action over the shield gate.

Red and Gold squadrons limp away, the plans secure, and a short time later they are in a briefing in which the princess and some hick turns up. Shit's real. The death star is approaching. They took _massive_ losses and now are so desperate that they have to draft this hick into their buddy's old callsign _just to fill a fucking seat_. As Dodonna is going over the plans, Wedge even notes that they might be fucked - the shot is impossible....

and then the fucking hick. Who has the nerve to show up and act like he owns the place. The hick who never even went to flight school, has the fucking _gall_ to say it would be ""just like bulls-eyeing womprats back home"". You know in that moment Wedge has a hatred for Luke that burns with the heat of 1,000 Tattooine suns. Imagine if it were the real world at someplace shitty like Ardennes in WW2, and some Greenhorn showed up just to be like ""yeah, I know you all have taken irrecoverable losses, and a lot of your friends have died... but this won't be so bad. I played linebacker for Iowa State, and this one time we held a goal line drive..."" 

BUT THEN IT GETS WORSE. The battle of Yavin, if you'll recall, did not go particularly well for the two squadrons of fighters they sent. Can you remember who all survived? Here, let me lay it out for you - 4 ships came back. Wedge (Red 2), Luke (Red 5) the Falcon, and some unnamed Y-Wing pilot that I can only assume died on landing because we never hear about him again. There were an incredible amount of losses....

So, with their last shot - hick McWacjob decides he'd be better free-handing this shit, leaving it up to ""god"" to decide whether or not his shot would hit the mark. You can see it in the control room when they ask him ""Luke, what's wrong? You've switched off your targeting computer?""

Seriously... fuck Luke."

"Your physiologic drive to breathe is based on carbon dioxide, not oxygen. As carbon dioxide builds within your blood, the body senses this, and responds by increasing your breathing rate.

Hyperventilating artificially reduces the amount of carbon dioxide within your blood (every time you exhale carbon dioxide is released) while negligibly increasing the amount of oxygen. 

This means you will have a lower drive to breathe (breathe less) while about the same amount of oxygen you normally would have in your blood. When exerting yourself, you will pass out as oxygen demand outpaces your drive to breathe.

"I dated some girl for all of about two weeks when I was 21. She added me on Facebook, and we had a couple mutual friends so I assumed we'd met at some party. We got to talking and somehow agreed to date.  

I went over to meet her one night, and she looked absolutely nothing like her profile picture. I don't mean she had some photo of herself from a few years ago - this was an entirely different person. Different eyes, nose, brow, the lot. Her roommate opened the door, and when I asked her where Catfish was and she pointed at her, I was sure she was joking.  

I think Catfish realised she'd fucked up, because she barely acknowledged me, avoided all eye contact, and spent most of the time pretending to do something in the bathroom, facing the wall where I couldn't even see her. I got out of there pretty quickly. During our breakup convo when I got home, she gave me this whole speech about how she's just shy, and how everyone uses flattering Facebook photos. Flattering, like photos of a more attractive person?  

It's a shame she felt she had to resort to that, because I might have given her a chance if she'd just been honest. Thankfully that was all that came of it. I've heard enough catfish horror stories about people getting strung along for ages and eventually losing everything. "

"I only skimmed the second half of your post because I'm already plenty aware that Mussolini started out as a leftist -- I'm pretty sure that's widely accepted fact so w/e. It doesn't really discount the later fascism, because inherently the two aren't connected at all, aside from him specifically. 

There is nothing ""socialist"" about fascism. A lot of fascism was intended at appealing to the working class, and because a lot of the working class was looking at socialism/leftism, fascists adopted leftist imagery to try to win them over. Yes, leninists and maoists advocate for a state owned economy, but sharing nationalization alone in common with communists doesn't make one a communist. Socialism's goal, no matter what their specific ideology is, is to abolish the state and establish communism. The efficacy of that isn't important, but the intention is. Fascism absolutely does not want to do that. The ""socialist"" fascist talking points you bring up don't say a single damn thing that suggests wanting to do that.

"First, I will preface by telling you I agree. I'll also skip the humble brag and just establish my source information as having established a consistent food logging habit 3 months ago to the day, and as of this morning's weigh in, I am down 25 lb.

However, while I will say that ""Calories in, Calories out"" dieting is simple, that does not make it easy. Especially in America we have a culture that wants us to think being overweight is not our fault, and that, in a twisted way, has kind of become a self fulfilling prophecy.  The public is told things like ""Obesity is a disease"" and ""Everyone's body is different"" which establishes opportunity for misconception, and then all the snake oil salesmen roll in to take advantage of the ugly side of unchecked capitalism, peddling their cures and simple tricks, and when none of it works it becomes easy to believe that it actually isn't anything you're doing.

The problem is only compounded when healthier people lay on the blame. Since we've already established the issue is false expectations, trying to get someone to believe your point of view by way of accusation only widens the gap of trust. Why should they believe you're correct, the other people were on their side, trying to help them, and they were wrong, but there are still more miracle cures and simple tricks to try; why would they try to cross the gap of understanding and take your view when you are clearly the only one who says it's their fault?

People do need to own the mistakes they're making that are making obesity an even worse problem, but it would go a long way if the legitimate diet and exercise culture was less antagonistic and blame prone."

"Not to discredit what you said but my family's situation was the exact opposite. 

My dad stayed because my mom would have abused us even more if he wasn't in the picture. She lied to everyone and had a lot more money. She could've easily made sure my dad was never in my life and was vindictive and manipulative enough to do so (she had him arrested about four years ago, he literally did nothing but she said he tried to kill her. Police took her side, even called for an ambulance when she had no bruising or injuries)

My dad did everything for us: cooked, cleaned, helped us with homework, taught us how to do basic life skills. Without him, I would be a terrible person, probably a lot like my mom and her family members.

Every situation is different and I think most loving parents will do what they think will hurt the child the least. I grew up knowing what acceptance and love was because my dad did stay.

"Many years ago, according to the stories told by the people of swole, there lived two brothers who were not like other men, or like the gods and goddesses of Mount Broylmpus. The name of the elder of these brothers was Brometheus. Brometheus was always thinking of improving and setting new PRs. He wished to spread the word of improvement to the world. Brometheus did not want to live amongst the Gods of Iron on Mount Broylmpus. He was too busy for that. The gods were spending their time lifting, but their bodies were the only swole that could be seen. Each of gods was propelled by jealousy, pettily comparing PRs like high scores on a game, wishing to inflate their ego with each rep. However, Brometheus was planning how to make the world stronger and better than it had ever been before. So instead of living on Broylmpus, Brometheus went out amongst men to live with them and help them and he quickly noticed that they were no longer happy as they had been during the golden days when Bronos, the titan, was king. He found them living by the Crossfit and cardio. They were hunted by wild beasts, and while humans had strong hearts, they could not fight back. ""If they only had Iron,"" said Brometheus to himself, ""they could at least fight the beasts and make gains; and after a while they could learn to make their own Iron and build themselves “gymnasiums”. 


Without Iron, they are worse off than the weak privileged.""Brometheus went boldly to Brodin and begged him to give Iron to the people, so that so they might be strong.""I will not!"" said Brodin, ""Not one plate will I share with them! For if men had Iron they might become strong and wise like us, and after a while they would drive us out of our kingdom. Besides, Iron is a dangerous tool and they are too poor and ignorant to be trusted with it. It is better that we on Mount Broylmpus rule the world without threat so all can be happy.""Brometheus didn't answer, but he had set his heart on helping mankind, and he did not give up. As he was walking by the seashore he found a sea snail. He saw that such a small soft creature, with steady determination could carry a heavy weight. He began a long journey to the top of Mount Broylmpus. ""Mankind shall have Iron, despite what Brodin has decided,"" he said to himself. And with that thought, he snuck quietly into Brodin’s domain and stole two plates from Brodin’s own rack. Brometheus securely strapped the plates to his back and hurried back to his own land, carrying with him the precious plates on his back. When he reached home, he called some of the thin people from their caves and built a bench and rack for them He showed them the dead lift, squat, and bench press. He showed them the food with which to make gains. Men and women gathered round the rack and were happy and filled with new strength, and thankful to Brometheus for the wonderful gift which he had brought to them.One evening, Brodin gazed down from Mount Broylmpus and noticed men and women lifting happily in every village across the land. It did not take him long to realize that Brometheus had disobeyed him and given Iron to men. Brodin was very angry and ordered that Brometheus be pinned under the mightiest of bars. And there Brometheus stayed, thinking of the future, happy in the knowledge that he had given Iron to men. After some time, men and women of the earth were strong, and they were ‘mired across the land by man and beast alike. They decided to thank Brometheus at the heights of Brolympus. As the people ascended, they heard a most saddening noise just outside the Temple atop the mountain. It was their savior, Brometheus, held down by a bar so mighty that no man can lift it.

Brodin saw the humans climb the mountain, and was angered and jealous of the gains they acquired. He saw them gather around Brometheus. His prisoner would not have the luxury of company! As Brodin approached the unforgiving bench, he saw the humans gather themselves into two groups, one on each side of the bar. Brodin hid himself and chuckled to himself. Perhaps this will teach those humans not to tread in the domain of gods.

The humans approached the bar and gripped it. As they lifted, the bar began to bend, but the weights remained on the ground. Bromethus pushed upward, and slowly, the weights rose. The bar was lifted, inch by inch, but lo, it crashed to the ground. Undeterred, the humans and Brometheus lifted again, and again, but with each attempt, the bar was raised less and less. “Enough! I have seen enough!” Brodin himself emerged from his cover and strode toward the humans and prisoner. “Why do you wish to free this man? He has wronged the gods, and must suffer.”

“No he has not.” replied a young man. He was not as mighty as some of the others, but he still stood valiantly. “Brometheus has saved us. No longer do we cower and run from animals, but we fight them. We use our cardio not to run, but hunt. We have fullness about our hearts. We feel complete both physically and mentally. Our PRs may not be as mighty as yours of the other gods, but that is not what is important.”

“This concept confounds me” Brodin stated. “If not to lift the heaviest weight, then why lift?” The young man replied,

“To improve. It does not matter where you are, but how far you’ve come. The iron tests us and our dedication, our determination. We have grown more on the inside than the outside.”

The man turned and headed to the bar, and the rest followed suit. Brodin watched on as the humans attempted again to raise the bar. Failure was wrought on their faces, and Brodin turned to the heights of Brolympus, and saw in sadness the vanity of the other gods. His fear had been realized. The humans grew wise, and him a fool.He once again gazed on the humans’ struggle. The more he looked on, the more his heart felt…different. As if his heart had swollen to defy the constraints of his chest. Visibly shaken, Brodin approached the bar. The humans, so dedicated and focused, did not notice. With an exhale and mighty pull, the bar was raised higher and higher until Bromethius was able to excape.

Before Brometheus could thank the humans, Brodin stood and stared down and the humans and demigod. “Forgive me. I thought all was the Iron and body. But I have experienced a new PR. I am now aware of the transformations of the heart and mind, and they too cannot be denied. This unity. This consolidation of mind heart and body, shall henceforth be called Swole. Only with all three tenets shall one ascribe the title of Swole to themselves.” Brodin approached the not-yet-strong man. “You are twixt the worlds of weak and strong, but your mind and heart are truly mighty. Your state shall be known as trans-swole, and it will be honored, as those who wish to change their weak bodies to strong ones are truly righteous if their commitment to the Iron is true. Pray to me at the Iron Temple and I will bless your reps. Worship me with righteous meals and I will bless you with gains.  Wheymen. "

"Yeah, randomly giving people LIVE ANIMALS is always awful, especially to children because now their parents have to learn and take care and spend money on this thing they were completely unprepared for if they want it to live. It's only going to end up stressing out the parents, and almost always killing the animal.

My gf's sister randomly brought home a fair goldfish home maybe 2 weeks ago, because she didn't know any better and she wanted to rescue it. I already have a ton of other fish tanks, and now it's adding a ton of extra work to keep this guy healthy but I'm just happy I can make sure he never gets in a bowl. He was free but he's still by far going to end up my most expensive fish because of how big of a tank he'll need when he gets bigger. I have him in a ~45 gallon temporary indoor pond-type thing until I can afford a big tank, but at least he's still super small right now."
"I had something like this almost.  My girlfriend's best friend was visiting and I was letting her try out the Vive in the living room.  We're sitting on the couch and she's playing Waltz of the Wizard.  At some point she bent over to try to pick something up and had her face like an inch from my lap.  I guess the helpless look I gave my girlfriend just fueled on her fits of laughter as I sat there with no idea what to do.  So I guess it wasn't too similar except for the head in the lap thing, but this still reminded me of it."

"The argument you make against caring about less/fewer could be made for pretty much every individual grammar rule. Yet you still seem to follow them assiduously. When nearly all grammar rules are  flaunted then yes that's when intelligibility begins to suffer. But the way you uphold the use of grammar rules generally is by upholding the use of individual rules. So yay for policing the less/fewer distinction.

Also you have no right to belittle ""pedantic weenies"" in one of the most pedantic posts I've seen on Reddit in a long time. The fit you throw over the difference between saying 1) '""literally"" has a new meaning' and 2) '""literally"" just has a new figurative use' is the fit of a pedantic weenie. The new meaning is in dictionaries and the use/meaning distinction doesn't seem to have any relevance to what you're saying. The new (semantic) meaning of ""literally"" allows it to be used as a generic intensifier. 

And low hanging fruit? Posting jeremiads against Reddit grammarists doesn't strike me as the loftiest use of your linguistic trivia. "

Meanwhile there's 2 decent public pools within a few miles that cost 100 to 200 a season.

"Mass Effect: Origins.

A series of AAA games in the ME universe.  Each game follows the origin of a single squadmate from the OT - and *every* squadmate gets their own game.  

They're all ME games, but some have other genres mixed in.

* Tali's game has a lot of crafting and engineering puzzles as you keep the Flotilla operational.

* Garrus's has you solving crimes and unraveling mysteries on the Citadel almost like LA Noir - ME Noir, anyone?

* Zaeed's lets you manage his Blue Suns, hiring and firing, accepting and declining mercenary missions.

Etc.  Each game has DLC(s) where you follow the character's adventures between the OT games, and/or during the games where the characters weren't crew on the Normandy.  So Jack's DLC has you teaching the kids at Grissom Academy, then managing and protecting them in the struggle against the Reapers. "

"I dated a police officer while she was going through academy and just after she started.

Her first week: She was almost hit by a carjacked escalade that was in the middle of a high speed chase.

She got into a scuffle with an armed man who wound up shooting just over her shoulder during the fight. She subdued him, no one died.

Her sergeant was going to take her to a call. She and her partner pile into his cruiser, get t-boned in an intersection and flip the car. Whenever there is a bad enough accident it automatically sets the radios to transmit. The first words over the air were ""Um. Sarge? I think I need new pants..."" Next day she received three pairs of pants from other cops who thought they were hilarious.

"I needed roughly two years to build up the courage to get out of the relationsship. Reason: didn't want to lose custody of my kid.

a) I started journaling the abuses, both the verbal and physical attacks. I wanted to be prepared for a custody battle, but it helped also to see the patterns more clearly - because no one will know and believe it like you do. And later, if my daughter will ever ask: ""Why did you leave mom?"" I'll just hand her that folder.

b) I secretly met with a lawyer. Unfortunately, she found a receipt. Big fight... always hide your stuff! Everything! If you think: ""I'd never rifle through her stuff, check her phone, read her emails - I am a decent guy"" well those standards do not necessarily apply to anyone but maybe you. Unfortunately, here in Germany, in the courts, the odds are still usually stacked against the father.

c) But what really made me make a move - I met with a counsellor/therapist. He told me: If she hits you again in front of your daughter you have two choices: you call the cops or you move out - because your kid is going to learn that type of behavior on a subconscious level and later on in life will replicate that in a relationsship just as her mother does now. 24 hours later I was out, because suddenly it dawned on me that the wellbeing and the future of my little daughter was truly in jeopardy.

We now have shared custody and my daughter is doing very well - but jesus, I'd never again hold out for such a long time! Get out, sooner than later!"

"There's 5000 colonists and 528 crew on the ship. The crew was going to wake up a month before the colonists. The colonists wake up 4 months before landing. 3 meals a day for the crew for 30 days equals 47520 meals. 3 meals a day for the 5528 total complement for 120 days equals 1990080 meals. Adding the two numbers equals 2037600 total meals needed for the voyage. That's assuming no reserve. If Aurora and Jim live to be 90 that is 64 years for Aurora and 52 years for Jim. I'm basing that on the actors real ages, I don't remember if their movie ages are ever stated. So for 52 years eating 3 meals a day they would consume 56940 meals. Aurora will eat 3 meals for 12 years by herself totaling 13140. That equals 70080 meals. Adding to that the year Jim spent alone is another 1095, totaling 71175 meals during their lives. 71175/2037600 equals .035. So they would eat 3.5% of the food stores aboard the ship. The rest of the colonists would be fine. If the crew went down to two meals a day during the four months that would more than make up for it."

"Not to try to make this a political debate or be insulting to anyone but it really bothers me with the rhetoric of this massive white male privilege. I'm a middle class white young adult male, I will never get anything given to me. My parents make just enough I don't get anything for my college but they can't afford to pay for it, so I took out a mass amount of loans and work 30-40 hours during school and 50+ during breaks. There is a likely chance I will be over looked on potential job prospects to give it to someone less qualified than myself to fill diversity quotas, though I do understand that is not always the case as there are things besides qualifications on paper that influence that such as charisma ect. If for some reason my girlfriend went off the deep end she could hit herself in the face and get me thrown in jail. If I was to have kids I would mostlikely have less rights to them than their mother(if she wanted it that way) if we divorced regardless of her actual ability to parent, I would have to pay child support and be the villain father who isn't around for his kids no matter how badly I wanted to be there. I'm the one who gets thrown on the curb and has to crash on a couch even if I pay literally all the bills. Again if my girlfriend were to go bonkers and come at me with a knife I not only have to fear for my life but also my freedom if I try to protect my life. No one believes that I can be the victim and am the asshole who committed the crime of simply existing. 

Luckily I have a wonderful girlfriend whom I love and I don't have to worry about a lot of those things, but as you can tell not all of us are that lucky. In this attempted notion at achieving equality we've caused this shift, again that some people would even argue I/we, referring to white males, deserve as we've ""had the power the rest of history"" while not denying that truth I've had no part in it. I wish to see the day we have true equality and that I won't be punished for the sins of people that came before me. Where the woman can be the bad guy, shitty parent, abuser and people don't assume that I get everything handed to me on a silver platter. "

"My parents live in a very rural area. I live in a very urban area (I'm in an apartment on the outskirts of downtown of a major city). My parents adopted a couple of kids, and my youngest siblings are black. They are the ONLY black students at their school, and the only other kids at their church who are black are also adopted. 

My son on the other hand, is one of 2 of the only white kids at our church. He's too young for school, but at the park, it's always a very broad mix of races. My mom has commented several times that I'm doing a much better job raising him in a diverse community then she's doing with the twins, and I think she feels guilty about it. 
Race is one of those things that you just don't like to talk about, and honestly we'll probably both get downvoted, but if you pay attention, it's surprising how white the rural areas are. "

"lived in big cities, lived in smaller cities, lived traveling, and lived in the sticks.  

One thing I can comfortably say is the more people packed into a smaller location, the more people need to isolate themselves for their own mental wellbeing. 

The less people you interact with on a daily basis. I'm not talking about having a conversation, but even just physically being around. Generally the more people actually converse and communicate in meaningful ways [meaningful not meaning for function or a direct benefit, but more in a mental health aspect/actually giving a shit].

People seem to have only a certain amount of social resources, and the more taxing the location [ie cities] the less they have to spend on anything non critical to their longterm wellbeing."

"My thoughts exactly.
My ex caused me to keep a mental list of dumbest fights ever had.
1. I like my steak medium well... to her this was clearly wrong and it has to be medium rare. To each their own I say, biut she said she would feel embarrassed if I ordered a medium well steak in a restaurant in front of other people... my counter argument that the fact that a waiter always asks how you would like it done, meant there is choice was meet with sneers.
Best of all this argument lasted 3 full days!

2. Had a very intense fight when I was transferring a file from my phone to her MacBook over Bluetooth, refusing to unload it to dropbox and share it with her. Reason for me refusing was that a. I didn't have a dropbox account and b. I distrust security of cloud storage. 

And in general she loves to drink but can't hold her booze. When she drinks she initially gets happy, then there's a brief spell of her being horny and all over me (literally 5 minutes) after which she turns absolutely vicious. She would start shouting that she hates me and that I'm an asshole, eventually trying to hit me (she's too drunk to land hits and to small -weight, not height- to cause any sort of damage).
I warned my friends amply before we all went out partying together, none believed me until they saw it 
Next day she wouldn't remember a single thing.

"unproven, but generally well known about the real reason he retired to ""play baseball""

Jordan gambled. A lot. He is also known for being a cheapass and not tipping dealers, etc...ok no big deal, but he stiffed people when he lost as well.  He used to play golf with a lot of people and lost his ass.  [Here is one of many articles](http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-03/sports/sp-42795_1_san-diego) documenting some of his losses and some real shady people are in there.  

OK so cut to the chase. His father gets whacked in the middle of nowhere driving.  The official reason is that he was carjacked I think.  But supposedly, it was to send a message after he ignored repeated attempts to collect on gambling losses.  Now, he was at the height of his career.  If it actually came out that he was gambling, the NBA would have had to deal with it.  So, rather than go through all that, they covered it up and he announced he would retire to ""play baseball"".  After 2 years of sucking in baseball, the smoke had cleared.  He comes back and picks up where he left off, but he lost 2 years of his prime in the process.  "

"There's tons of documentaries on him but the only ones I know of are made for tv specials that aired once or twice around the last time he was up for parole and sabotaged himself.

"Suge probably had nothing to do with it. He was never that much of a master plan pulling person, more like the straightforward Deebo-esque tough guy from South Central. All of the anecdotes about him include him showing up with some of his older friends from the hood who happen to be bodyguards, not really caring about who notices him. He couldn't keep Death Row together after Pac died, while Diddy could really cash in on Biggie's death. Not to mention that the dude pulled the legally blind card when he ran over a manager while visiting the shoot of the Straight Outta Compton movie, and even got shot prior to that. The Kimmel appearance was most likely just him running his mouth because he's kind of an asshole like that.  

The part about Eazy not directly dying from AIDS is not that much of a reach though. I think it was Krayzie Bone from Bone Thugs-n-Harmony who said that a month prior his death he was completely fine, had no health problems besides asthma. It takes much longer for someone to die from AIDS like how they claimed it was with Eazy."

"Whiny bitch (Me) rant ahead.  

Probably when my grandmother adopted my cousin-by-marriage.  
Basically, I am 8 years older than my cousin. My grandmother's husband is my step-grandfather. My step-grandfather's son had a son that he essentially abandoned. That is my cousin. He was then given to my grandparents after a lengthy court and adoption process.  

After they adopted him, (because I was about 13 or so) I didn't bear any ill will towards towards my cousin at first, because he was born into a shitty situation. The problem was, his father is a shitty person who abandoned his son because he was raised by my grandparents, who spoiled him rotten and never let him fail and make his own mistakes. They are doing the same thing with my cousin.  
I feel like once they adopted him and he was always around, my grandmother changed a lot of who she was that I loved her for. It's too hard to go into details, but my cousin is a nightmare child that no one in our family likes (other family members have tried to tell her she's making the mistake of raising him like she did his father) and everyone athis school hates him. He literally has zero friends as an 12 year old because he's mean and selfish.  

As soon as he became apart of the official family, everything changed quite a bit. You know how if a child interrupts an adult talking, he gets corrected and told to wait until someone else is finished talking? The last time he interrupted me while I was talking to my husband, I said, ""I was talking to my husband. Could you wait a second?"" My grandmother completely went off on me and told me that it was clear I didn't like him and if I hated him so much I could stay out of her house.  

Every time he's around at a family gathering, there's something a little awkward in the air and everyone is uncomfortable while my grandmother dotes on him and never corrects his bad behavior, probably because a lot of the old relatives remember how my grandparents used to treat my cousin's dad the same way, and that guy ended up in prison with 4 abandoned kids (The others are with their mother.... I think...)  

I realize it's the dumbest thing in the world to be jealous of and hate a child, since I'm a grown, married woman, but my childhood stopped as soon as he became apart of the family and my favorite grandparent became a person I didn't like or recognize. So I bear a fair bit of resentment towards him.  

Bonus story no one asked for: When a friendly kid approaches him and tries to play, he instantly gets mean and insults them until they get hurt. They back off and go find someone else and then my cousin runs to my grandmother and cries about how no one likes him.  
I feel like that was a lot to get off my chest....."

What's worse is they told the public that they were steering clear of the case and handing it over to the law enforcement of a nearby county. then as the case continued it was discovered that they found every single piece of evidence of any substance in the case.

Any other country would have released him or at least ordered a retrial."

"Also worth noting that 14 years before the sinking of the titanic there was a [story](http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/04/14/author-predicts-titanic-sinking-14-years-earlier/)  published with eerily similar details. The size of the ship, an iceberg, lack of life boats, even the fictional boat was named ""the Titan""... is it possible that someone read that book and got the idea to sink the titanic? It's a very strange coincidence at the least.

An alternative Titanic sabotage theory claims that the ship was intentionally sunk to get rid of Political opposition in regards to creating the US Federal Reserve.  Though  admittedly it's hard to research this theory without running into ""it's all part of the reptilian agenda!!!"" claims.

"It's a misconception that dealers will give you a better price if you pay cash. They make what's called a 'front end' and a 'back end' on a car deal. Front end is the profit from the asking price. Back end is the additional profit from financing (in my state it's capped at 2% so, if a bank offers to buy the loan at 4% interest, the dealer can up that to 6% interest and keep the difference), which is the common practice.

If you tell them you're buying in cash, they know they won't make anything on the back end (except maybe additional warranties) so they'll try and up what they make on the front end."

"From my days in the music industry:

If you frequent concerts, you're well aware of the ""encore"" and ""one more song"" chants that start at what you believe to be the end of an artist's set. This isn't the end. 

When an artist is on stage, they have a pre-set time limit to how long they can play for. Openers usually have no longer than 30 minutes, a secondary act can get 45 minutes to an hour, and your main act usually has about an hour and a half. It also depends on how many openers there are. 

That being said, the encore is built in to the set list. The artist plays their first 6-7 songs and does their thing, then leaves the stage after telling y'all goodnight, you've been a great crowd, etc. However, their set list still has three more songs already built in. When you start screaming encore, you actually have no effect on whether or not the band is going to return. They're going to come back and finish their set list or play until their time runs out, regardless. "

Gender, political correctness and whatever else: I worry we are becoming a little too ""sensitive"". And what's up with all these random genders? I'm 32 and it seems just last few years there's this been this sudden uptake in all this ""sjw"" stuff.

The government is flying planes over your cities to spy on you and watch people they don't like.

https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11380034/fbi-homeland-security-airplane-surveillance-flights

The government has equipped these planes with various devices designed to help them track and record all of your cellular data. Some versions of these devices can remotely hack your phone in a number of extremely invasive and malicious ways that are still covert and very very hard to detect. In some cases practically impossible.

The technical capacity to identify your face using a surveillance camera, and use such a camera to track your person in real time is currently close to completion, and there is government interest in such a technical capacity.

I'm doing a bad job of describing just how serious and terrifying this is. In a few years the government will essentially be able to say ""give me everything on Alex Smith"" and instead of just getting employment history, financial records, schooling info, etc, they'll also have a computer estimation of your personality, who your friends are, who you trust the most, places you are likely to hide, your bad habits, everything. A completely computer generated estimation of every single thing about you. Everything you've ever done online. An estimation of how much of a threat you pose. Can probably even guess if you're pregnant. All of it. All associated to your real name and address. Legally. No warrants required, no privacy protections left.... That's the future. It's some Ghost in the Shell shit. There was/is another set of information I can't currently find that basically explains that the social media manipulation programs can be used to effectively gaslight people to believe things that never happened or aren't true, to leverage their views to get them to support something they don't and shouldn't logically agree with..... and it does it very, very well. All the time. With everyone. "

Also worth noting that some testimony from ex-soldiers even indicates the infamous Order 227 which inspired those detachments actually served as a major symbol of Russian defiance in the face of the enemy as, at any rate, shooting deserters was already a thing in most armies to begin with, and it emphasised to ordinary men that Russia wasn't infinite, and if they kept retreating so easily they'd run out of anything worth retreating to."

Definitely true, but another facet is that it's a hell of a lot easier to train up people on driving and put the halfway decent drivers at the wheel of a Jeep or truck than it is to train people to ride horses. 

Plus, since the parts are interchangeable, you can cobble together stuff to fix it. One jeep got a flat, another one got a fucked up sparkplug? Swap tires, pile in and off you go, leaving the second jeep for the mechanics. Two horses injured? Well, you're down two horses. "

"The Germans almost immediately copied the 1886 Lebel and began issuing the Geweher 1888, so the Lebel, while innovative, really didn't catapult the French to the forefront of military dominance in Europe. By the late 19th century the rapidly increasing industry and population of Germany put them ahead of France. The French had no illusions about their ability to fight a successful war 1 on 1 against the German Empire. That's why they cemented an alliance with the Russians. It ensured that if there were hostilities against Germany, they would be forced to fight a two front war against an even larger adversary. This is why the German general staff came up with the Schlieffen Plan in response. "

"My boyfriend was raised in an extremely Christian home and grew up to reject it because of the pressure from his family. When I met him he said he had no interest in religion but after a couple months he slowly started rediscovering his faith. 

He asked me to seek God with him and I tried for the sake of trying. One night I awkwardly prayed while laying in bed and felt a presence that filled me with light, peace, and joy. It was beautiful. But I still wasn't convinced, as I was set in my ways. I didn't want my views and beliefs challenged so I tried the ""fake it till I make it"" route. 

That didn't last too long because I had too many questions about how my (left-leaning) views would coexist with the Bible so I challenged everything he said. We started fighting a lot over unresolved issues surrounding our faith and one night it came to a breaking point where things got physical. He left the next day and begged me not to give up on my faith. I promised I wouldn't but I had no intention of keeping that promise. 

I was crushed though. The first night, I lay in our bed in our empty bedroom shaking and crying as the realization that he was gone set in. I saw the little Bible sitting on my night stand and started reading it the next morning, just looking for Scripture to help ease the pain I was feeling. I read Psalm 38 and felt the same peaceful presence that I felt a couple months prior. 

I kept reading and started praying. Things started making sense and falling into place, so I decided to just trust what was happening. Long story short, I invited Jesus into my heart. As for my boyfriend, we're on the mend and trying to build a solid foundation going forward with our relationship where  God will be the forefront. 

I'm learning that faith takes work but the more I seek God the more he reveals himself to me in small ways. For instance, I've been extremely happy with my newfound faith and wanting to shout it from the rooftops; finding this thread and telling my story allowed me to give Him the glory for the joy in my heart.

I do think it's fear and a lack of education that are making it hardest for them to accept right now. They're just concerned for me, and don't really know how to handle it yet. But they're learning, and that's all I need to know they care.

"Sharing the road with cyclists.  

I always hear people complaining about cyclists.  And it's not always cyclists disobeying traffic laws, but rather, them just *being* there.

Like dude, if the cyclist is running stoplights and weaving in and out of traffic, and being a total douche, then fine.  But if they're just riding two abreast in the road and you have to slow down for a few seconds of your life before passing them, just deal with it, dude.  They aren't breaking the rules.

As for cyclists that don't follow the rules.... It's a simple concept.  follow the same rules as drivers.  Stop at stop signs and red lights.  Yield when you are supposed to.  Be predicable. It's not that freaking hard 

Ironically, I saw something on Facebook the other day of some new backup camera for cyclists and people were like ""that's so lazy! Fucking cyclists rabble rabble.""  Like dude, they're on a bike and you're in a car, they're not lazy "

"Ugh, I remember it well. Had chipped a tooth (molar) one December when I was 18. I've always had bad teeth and hated dentists, so I didn't mention it to my family. Stupid mistake. 

Around 2 weeks later, the pain was near unbearable, still didn't say anything. 
It was only when my mums friend noticed I was in pain that I had to tell them. It was about 3 days before Christmas so we had to go to dentist early in the morning, without an appointment. I sat there for nearly 2 hours in so much pain I nearly puked.

The dentist finally saw me, and after giving me a strong pain killer, inspected the tooth. The root was rotting and the tooth was dead. He had to pull it out. The only funny thing about this situation was that he offered to give the tooth to my Mother to bring home lol 😂 

Apologies for the length but let this be a lesson: if you chip your tooth, go to a dentist!!!!!"

Also they did not know they were about to land on an ocean planet with a perpetual tsunami going around the planet, and thus they could not have predicted that this tsunami was going to disable their ship leaving them on the planet longer than what they had planned for. "

"The social sciences and humanities have been doing this for a while now though, it isn't new. I've got a friend who use to be a hard core feminist...until she got her bachelors in gender studies. Academic feminism is one of the most toxic and disingenuous studies there are. She still considers herself what most people would consider a feminist but she said literally what the person above said, dissent is not allowed. From what she, as well as countless others have said you basically get shouted down for arguing against anything that's said. Even when it's not agreed upon within the discipline. 

I saw this myself when I went or my bachelors in archaeology of all things. There's a huge push by cultural anthropologists, or at least the ones who fell on the post modernist side of the science wars, to push science out of the field. And this isn't some fringe lunatic group. This was literally the biggest topic in my capstone class, archaeology and physical anthropology students on one side and cultural anthropology students on the other. Luckily the teachers for that particular class were mostly impartial but when I had to take the cultural anthropology class I had a culture that I grew up in ""explained"" to me by an upper middle class sycophant of the cult of feelings. She had no idea what she was talking about, had no direct experience, but it's what the literature said. My point is, don't kid yourself, a lot of the post modern classes don't deal with facts, they deal with feelings."

"I used to work in air ambulance billing and have a little more Knowldge on the subject than others.  Most pilots are former military,  but we are seeing more private pilots as well.  The standard crew usually consists of a pilot,  nurse,  and paramedic.  

The main reason why flights cost $30,000 plus is due to poor government insurance reimbursement rates, people refusing to pay or being unable to pay their bills,  our attempt to treat all patients the same, people's inability to shop around or negotiate the price before service due to the emergent nature of the call, and private insurers paying as little as possible.

Government insurance such as medicare pays just enough for us to break even.  And that's assuming the patient pays their coinsurance which usually doesn't happen because those on medicare are often on a fixed income. Couple this with the elderly population rapidly increasing,  and them using our service disproportionately more because of their worsening health, it creates an issue.  When it comes to medicaid,  we are lucky to get paid at all,  and when we do it is often times $1,000 or less. 


People who do not have insurance or have insurance with 20k+ deductibles simply don't pay their bills.  It doesn't make sense to. When you have a medical event so bad that a helicopter is called,  you likely have massive bills from the hospital and other emergency responders as well.  There's no reason to try to pay any of them.  Even if you used up all your life's savings to pay,  you won't make a dent in the debt. You would still owe tens of thousands, so why pay at all? 


Private insurers such as blue cross,  blue shield,  Aetna, humana,  etc, do not make money by paying insurance claims.  These companies attempt to pay as little as possible. They do so by filling their policies with hundreds of hard to understand exemptions,  or they delay the payment as long as legally possible.  


People aren't able to shop for the most cost effective service in an emergency, so there is little incentive for the business to compete with other businesses and reduce the cost. 

Because everyone pays as little as possible,  we bill as much as possible in hopes that some insurances pay the full amount which makes up for all those who don't pay. In an attempt to follow medicare guidlines, we have to bill everybody the same, which means everyone receives this inflated bill. The flight should cost around 6-10,000 which I think is pretty reasonable considering it is paying for a pilot, nurse, paramedic, dispatchers, aND a mechanic 24/7, 365 whether they are carrying for a patient or not Then there's the initial cost of the aircraft,  fuel,  scheduled maintenance,  training, and regulatory compliance.  


#Tldr. The air medical industry faces the same issues many other medical industries face. Individual payors do not have the money to pay,  private insurances pay as little as possible,  and government insurance says fuck you, we'll pay what we want.

"These three classes existed side by side by side in my neighborhood growing up. Starting on one side you had a lot of run down house mixed  with trailers, a strip of empty land with high voltage lines on it then slightly newer and nicer houses, then a development (like from the 90s) with homes over 7 figures. 

On the bus there was an on going argument between kids that lived in trailers and the kids in million dollars homes about if they were ""rich"" or ""upper middle class"". One week we come to the stop for the rich side and see them all in the street playing some simple version of cricket. They all got on to a quiet bus and after about 30 seconds someone went ""...you're all fucking rich"" and we never had the argument again."

So after a few akward moments someone in the back of the line said ""please hand her this!"" holding out this hand with a fiver. More people then did the same, leaving the woman with enough money to pay this grocery trip, but also atleast the next two.

As she left she thanked us all in a language I could not understand, so I just nodded my head and said ""you're welcome, you're welcome"". When she left the store someone in the cue translated what she said; it was something along the lines of how she had fled from her country (Syria, Libya or Iraq, cant remember) and had lost her husband, now shes in our country but she hadnt received much help from the goverment yet, so she was very thankfull for us strangers just giving her money to pay for her food..

"One day my childhood friend's mom came into the store with her younger daughter. I hadn't seen them in half a decade or more. This was around Christmas, at a hip clothing / households store and of course the lines were insane.

Well she approaches with enormous arms full of all kinds of shit. I scan it all through while she doesn't make any small talk, just stares at me with the biggest smile. 'Well, I guess she's happy to see me again.'

I tell her the amount due. Still, huge smile, and she proudly presents a credit card. I run it through: declined. She gives me another, now with less of a smile, and that one gets declined.

She gives me *seven or eight* cards and finally one of them works. By this point, there is absolutely no smile and the daughter looks embarrassed. She carefully takes and folds the receipt and walks away without a word.

I didn't realize until later, but her smile was more of a 'won the lotto' type smile, and I guess she assumed that I was just going to scan everything and then just give it to her for free.

She came back that evening and returned everything. But Jesus, to have so many credit cards. The store was just so busy that I didn't even put two and two together. And these were credit cards that looked like they came from only the scummiest of places. I mean, I've had friends ask me for discounts, but to just hand over five bag fulls of clothes for free?"

Turns out she forgot to switch her old expired card with her new one and didn't have anything else with her to pay. So she left me with the waitress as collateral. I was like 12/13 so I just sat in the waiting area and didn't need to be looked after or anything but my mom still bought the waitress one of those giant muffins when she got back. From then on she never left the house without more than one form of payment.

Lines like ""We finish each others'..."" ""Sandwiches!"" ""that's what I was gonna say!"" show Hans being very quick to make himself the man of Anna's dreams and agreeing with whatever she says. 

The one thing that really doesn't fit was the look he gave after their first exchange when she bumped into him. It was a look of happiness and love and she wasn't even looking at it so it couldn't have been to manipulate her. That moment doesn't really fit with him being a villain.

"Not Walmart, Kroger. But it's a pretty Walmart story, so:

One day I'm working back in the Bakery, and a coworker from the Seafood department calls me over to a nearby aisle. I come over, and she points to a small brown splatter on the ground that looks vaguely like chocolate milk, and says ""I think that's poo"". Now, it was so small there wasn't really an odor to it, so I had my doubts, and said it was probably a spilled drink from some kid's sippy cup. The coworker, refusing to be deterred, looks ahead, and finds another speckle, and then another. Well, of course I have literally nothing better to do with my paid hours, so I decide to accompany her on her journey.

As we meander on the ol' splattery trail, the speckles start getting larger, and I can now get a whiff of them. Yep, it's poo- and raunchy, nasty, foul ass poo too. We pass a grocery boy, who asks what we're doing, and we in no uncertain terms explain we're following a trail of poo. Obviously he's intrigued because who wouldn't be, and he joins in.

Genuinely, this trail leads us all the way from aisle 5 to aisle 17, even winding down a few. But we were a tenacious team, we refused to relent. We even gather another follower, a cashier on his break, on our brave quest.

Finally, we make it to the 'pot of gold'- a poor old man, standing in the corner of the dairy, with a large puddle of poo surrounding his feet. Apparently he had made a mad dash (as mad as an old man can dash) for the potty, but lost his game of fate right in front of the milk. We were saddened for him and embarrassed, and called a comanager to assist him.

Of course, when she arrived, she asked why 4 of her employees were chasing a shit trail through the store. We really didn't have an excuse beyond ""Well why not?"".

And that is the tale of the Poop Sleuth. "

When enough is enough is a grey area, but generally, if the animal is suffering and unable to do what it's supposed to, and treating the problem would be time-consuming and expensive, then it's time to put it down.

But like another commenter said, I'm not going into debt because my pet has cancer. "

"My parents got me 2 birds when I was younger. Never named them. 2-3 weeks after getting them one of the birds died, so we went out and got a new one. A week later the new bird died. I named the bird that survived Lucky, since it survived when the others couldn't.

It died that night.

"French dude who made a bunch of contributions to abstract algebra as a teenager, got expelled from university for being a political firebrand, and died in a duel at age 20.

He had a sense of impending doom before he died and basically spammed all of his acquaintances with his life's work. It's a myth that he wrote it all down the night before he died; he mostly just put some finishing touches on his existing manuscripts and sent them off. His writings were so pivotal that we call the branch of mathematics that emerged from them Galois theory.

I have three dogs and they are incredibly responsive to commands...pretty much all because of her methodology. We don't hit them or try to dominate them, we simply work with them. My GSP is incredibly talented with agility courses and, for a high-energy dog, is very well-behaved. "

"Very true. If the odds of life forming on a habitable planet is high, then I can see that the Fermi paradox would be more pertinent. But how can we even estimate the chances that life forms eventually? There are so many random events that have led to our development that it's hard to say whether life forming is a likely development or an anomaly. If life forming on habitable planets is something low like one in a thousand, and one existing long enough to develop interstellar travel is one in 100,000, then there would only be something like 400 possible space-faring civilizations. So it's hard for something like the Fermi paradox to be a definitive case, I think."

"Basically (and my knowledge is very basic):

Electrons (and pretty much most things that make up atoms as I understand) exist both as particles and waves at the same time. When looking at them you can choose to either find out their speed, or exactly where they are in the electron cloud. You cannot measure both at once, and once you discover one, you can't go back to look at the other; the sheer act of observation fixes the electron in space or time. 

This is the [Uncertainty Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) as determined by Werner Heisenberg. His buddy Neils Bohr figured that the two must coexist using the [Complimentarity Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(physics)). While they didn't always agree, they did come up with the [Copenhagen Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation), that pretty much states the two are kind of mutually exclusive, nothing makes sense, and nobody exists on purpose (again, I'm *super* paraphrasing)

They also heavily followed Einstein who realized that there is no such thing as an objective universe, everything affects everything else, even simple observation, which is where uncertainty arises from.

"So, consider this: The time before you were born.... how was that? It wasnt good or bad, wasnt anything right? If we really are only our physical forms, then death is likely to return us back to that. Life, like death, are both ideas that we conceive of because we can. Once we go there would be no ""us"" to even have opinions of our own death. Really think about that, think about life itself and its finite nature. Think about animals that live and die, and how nature and life simply move on. It doesnt have to be a scary thought that you may one day not exist, because from the dawn of time until a few decades ago, you didnt exist then either.

My dad died recently, and this is all where i landed with it. I dont think he exists anymore, not really. When those of us who remember him pass om, his memory will be gone and he really wont exist. I know its not the most romantic way of putting it but i feel like im being honest with myself this way, and that is what gives me the clarity to live how i really want to. I dont fear some lake of fire or a god whos judgements are incredibly human sounding. I dont have any of that stuff to obfuscate how i view the world. Best of all, i know i try to be good to people because id rather do that than be a dick. 

In other words, non existence makes your fear irrelevant. Your fear isnt even real, you just feel it when you ponder your own mortality (which is where heaven comes in for so many people). I take comfort knowing that im more likely to not exist than to have to burn for eternity because of ideas that were put in my head my whole life. It isnt why i think what i do, but it certainly combats the feeling of scariness."

"Was in an abusive relationship to which the last 7 years were a nightmare. I was waterboarded during sleep to demand sex, would not let me spend my own money to go get coffee with a friend and instead got a kitchen knife pulled out at me with threats, I had been told she was seen with another guy and she jokingly presented him to me as ""her lover"" but it was serious... 

... I had caught her in bed with another guy (the lover guy, my former best friend), and frankly I had enough by then. Went to work the next day and never came back home to her. But even then it was hell to completely break off as she demanded ""explanations"" and to ""do the right thing and talk about it"". I had caught them red handed and while he accepted his guilt she denied everything. A very sick relationship. It took me almost a year to consider going out with anyone. 

Eventually someone had broken in to my ex-home a few days later and ""mysteriously only took some jewelry and MY DOCUMENTS"", yep, not the DVD players or computer. MY STUFF: passport, visa, professional degree credentials... name it.

"That's what I should have done, but instead I threw her across room to get her off me.  So now I was blamed for everything.  She would break into the room I was sleeping in and pull me out of bed and start screaming and crying about nonsense.  She didn't work, so she could fuck with my sleep.  I freaked eventually, threw her off me, and started smashing some stuff around house instead of smashing her.  Then I left the house to get away.  Came back 3 hours later and police were there blaming me.  

Went to marriage counseling, shit didn't go anywhere.  She ninja moved out and took half stuff while I was away on work trip.  She went on a road trip with friends, never came back.  We eventually divorced.  What a waste of 5 years."

"Dunno if you're sarcastic or not, but for anyone asking, sperm cells ""swim"" through the vaginal fluids. As long as the sperm is healthy, being on top won't change a thing. There are an average of 120 million sperm cells per mL of sperm. Considering the average is around 4 mL, the number is huge and is so to ensure that some sperm cells do make it into the uterus and then the tubes, where the fecundation occurs"
"I was going to community college and my mom, who was dating an asshole, declared one day that I needed to move out. 

OK...whatever. I'm 24 at this point and while it really sucks, I suck it up and start looking for a roommate.

I answer an ad at school and make friends with the girl looking for a roommate. And she's a topless dancer. Like an idiot, we start dating. 

18 months later, I've graduated with my associates degree. But we've broken up after months of her negativity, mood swings, constant derision, constant belittling, occasional tirades and overall rotten behavior.

I was constantly depressed around her. Nothing I ever did was right. In addition to her being stupid as fuck, she was generally a selfish, unkind and overall disaster as a human being. It took me years to get over the abuse.

NOTE: To answer ""how did I get out of it"", one day she starts going off about wanting to kill our roommate (another topless dancer). I decided then and there that I had enough. I talked my mom into letting me crash at her place for a couple months. After I moved out, we still dated/hooked up for a little while. One day, after getting together, she accused me of being gay. (Seriously? WTF?). I told her to leave. I never talked to her again. I eventually realized she had a lot of serious problems. Being a dancer probably didn't help. Eventually, after I realized how she'd messed me up, I hated her for years.  Shit. I just realized that was 30 years ago. Letting this out felt good. Thanks reddit."

"Hunters and anglers are among the most conservation-minded people out there.

Hunting is a valid part of conservation, just as forestry is. Public land must be managed for multiple use and sustainable resource extraction in order to provide balance for people (resources and recreations) and environment.

"speaking of bears...

three people are going hiking in the woods and decide to hire a guide since they know there are bears out there.

The guide introduces them to the trail and warns them that there are three types of bears in the woods, black bears, brown bears, and grizzly bears, but that they don't need to worry because he knows how to scare them off. 

He gives each hiker a can of pepper spray and a bell. The bell makes noise so the bear knows you're coming and will run away since they're pretty shy, and the pepper spray is in case they *don't* run away. All pretty simple.

So they go hiking into the woods. After a bit they come to a big pile of droppings on the ground. 

The hikers ask the guide, ""What kind of animal made that poop?"" 

The guide gets a stick and pokes it for a second and says, ""That there is black bear poop.""

The hikers ask, ""How do you know?""

""Well, it's small, round and has berry seeds in it, see?""

Everyone nods and continues hiking. After a while, they come to another big pile of poop. They ask the guide, ""What animal made *that* poop?""

The guide leans down close for a second and says, ""That there is brown bear poop.""

""How do you know?""

""Well see it's soft and dark and has fish bones in it.""

The hikers nod and keep hiking. After a while they come to a *really* big pile of poop.

""*What* kind of animal made *THAT* poop?""

The guide gets a stick and leans down close, ""That right there is grizzly bear poop.""

""How do you know?""

""Cuz it smells like pepper spray and has little bells in it."""

"War, and all things associated with war. 

In what other area of human existence is the killing of an entire family not only dismissed as ""collateral damage"", but actually rationalized through an entire system of morality that recognizes war as just? Take a house with a family in it and two enemy soldiers firing from the windows. Picture you storming the house, capturing the soldiers as well as the family, and then putting them all on their knees and shooting them. Abhorrent, right? Now transition to the real world, where we drop a bomb on the house and kill everyone inside it. Exact same end result, but that's a morally justifiable case of collateral damage. 

This thinking scales up until exterminating a city full of people with a nuclear fireball becomes justifiable. War is fucked and all our thinking surrounding it is fucked. "

"I had something really similar happen to me in 3rd grade, because the teacher didn't like that I could read at a really high level, but could  write only a little better than a first grader. So she told every staff member and my parents that I was illiterate and severely mentally disabled( I don't use the words she called me,) and recommended I go to Special Needs School. She decided to do this just as I was being tested for the gifted program, which would have given me access to more challenging classes and better after school programs. She also made fun of me in front of the class, 
At one point she even ripped up an essay of mine in front of everyone after pretending to like it and reading it out loud.

Please do not adopt a child until you change this mindset. You should not adopt a child if you feel like you are going to be a ""fake mommy"" if it was not ""yours"".

First, find a new shelter, preferably a farm. I would check the status of livestock, and acquire what animals I need for survival. I would have a stock of chickens, pigs, cows, etc for me and my dog. Plus, I would have to work the land for produce. 

Next, I would pillage nearby communities for vehicles, hunting equipment, and whatever other items I deem necessary for my survival. 

If/when the power grid goes down (I've read it would most likely go down 5-7 days later), I wouldn't need to worry, as I'm self-sustained. 

I would find a nearby lake or river for clean water (hopefully find a water truck to haul water back to the farmstead and purify it).

There are still miles upon miles of nearly entirely untouched land. The UK in comparison is pretty small (it's about as large as Michigan) but has a much higher population density and many hundreds of years of history as a populated country - meaning that there's literally not a single square metre on Great Britain that hasn't been manipulated by man in some way - every single place on the island, including our ""national parks"", are man-made, artificial environments. The entire countryside is essentially a large, curated garden, where every tree has been planted by someone, where any wildlife more dangerous then a deer has been deliberately killed off or domesticated for safety and security. And in the case of our national parks, thousands of pounds are spent to maintain the environment in it's artificial form, the one we associate with, rather then allowing the place to return to nature."

Usually they will answer they don't handle billing, and tell you you can call billing another time but they're closed now, and when you call the billing department they say they don't know and you need to ask the doctor, but you asked the doctor and he didn't know either. 

And then even if any of them *do* know, they'll say 'but the insurance will cover it', but they don't actually know that and its just plain not true.  Then you can call up the insurance to find out how much they will cover but they won't know for 6 months, at which point you'll start receiving collections letters for ""past due"" bills which were never sent to you in the first place from the doctor, the facility, the lab and possibly others."

If so, why do we feel jealous and singular about loving one person when logically the race would grow faster if we were able to love and procreate with more people at once? Is this simply a western idealism about love? "

"I worked in the lingerie department at Nordstrom and one time this guy came in looking for “something sexy” for his girlfriend. I asked him what size she was and he looks me up and down in the creepiest possible way and says “about your size.” Whenever a guy was creepy, I would do my usual thing where I’d get them to spend way too much on lingerie, which both drained their bank account thus getting me a good commission, as well as made sure whoever the creep was dating at least got something good out of the relationship. 

Anyway, a week later the same guy comes in with a woman who is *definitely* not my size and his two small children. I glance at her finger and realize this was not in fact his “girlfriend,” but his wife. He sort of sheepishly stood behind her not making eye contact with me while she returned the lingerie he bought (that I think was probably for the person he was having an affair with) because it obviously didn’t fit. I didn’t want to be the one to break it to her, I mean it wasn’t completely inconceivable that he just “accidentally” called her his girlfriend and completely estimated the wrong size for her. So instead I happily took back the lingerie and then made sure he spent hours waiting while I found her multiple more expensive items in her size to replace them with. 

While ringing her up she thanked me and said something along the lines of “I don’t know how he got my size so wrong, he’s always gotten it right before.” In response I sort of shrugged, but shot him a look of absolute disgust which I think she caught. And I overheard her on the way out start to interrogate him based on my reaction. Never knew what happened after, but I hope that woman ran for the hills from that narcissistic asshole.

"Back in high school I also thought China had nothing to do with WW2 but then I realized they had veto powers as Permanent Members of UN Security Council which are composed of major players who helped secure the victory for Allied powers.

It has to be pointed out though that then it was Chiang kai Shek who led (Republic of) China in its effort to hold off Japanese troops. 20+ years later after WW2, ROC and CKS retreated to Taiwan and the government of People's Republic of China has represented China in UN Security Council since.

Another side note, the Allies barely funded or supported the Chinese front of WW2. The ROC and communists (who would then form the PRC) joined forces and prevented Japanese advance westward by means of relatively primordial tools."

One of the most obvious pointers for this is, of course, German concentration/death camps, but those are well-known, so I won't go into it. What most people have never heard of is [Unit 731](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731), which was basically a Japanese experimental program which carried out some of the most atrocious experiments in history. From the wiki page:

&gt;Thousands of men, women and children interned at prisoner of war camps were subjected to vivisection, often without anesthesia and usually ending with the death of the victim.[22] Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases. Researchers performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body. These were conducted while the patients were alive because it was feared that the decomposition process would affect the results.[23] The infected and vivisected prisoners included men, women, children, and infants.[24]
Prisoners had limbs amputated in order to study blood loss. Those limbs that were removed were sometimes re-attached to the opposite sides of the body. Some prisoners' limbs were frozen and amputated, while others had limbs frozen, then thawed to study the effects of the resultant untreated gangrene and rotting.
Some prisoners had their stomachs surgically removed and the oesophagus reattached to the intestines. Parts of the brain, lungs, liver, etc., were removed from some prisoners.[22]

&gt;In other tests, subjects were deprived of food and water to determine the length of time until death; placed into high-pressure chambers until death; experimented upon to determine the relationship between temperature, burns, and human survival; placed into centrifuges and spun until death; injected with animal blood; exposed to lethal doses of x-rays; subjected to various chemical weapons inside gas chambers; injected with sea water; and burned or buried alive.

The wiki page has a lot more, and that's just what was documented. Really terrifying stuff. In addition, however, there was the [Rape of Nanking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre). This one is more well-known, but a lot of people don't realize the extent of what happened.

&gt;The International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo estimated in 1946 that over 200,000 Chinese were killed in the incident.[11] China's official estimate is more than 300,000 dead based on the evaluation of the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal in 1947.

&gt;Two girls, about 16, were raped to death in one of the refugee camps. In the University Middle School where there are 8,000 people the Japs came in ten times last night, over the wall, stole food, clothing, and raped until they were satisfied. They bayoneted one little boy of eight who [had] five bayonet wounds including one that penetrated his stomach, a portion of omentum was outside the abdomen.

The wiki page on that is pretty NSFW, it includes a photo of a dead young girl with a spear (or something like it) in her vagina. Truly horrifying stuff, and by most accounts, Japanese leadership did nothing to stop it.

The last thing that most Westerners don't know about is the [Comfort Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women) program. 

&gt;Comfort women were women and girls forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army in occupied territories before and during World War II. Estimates vary as to how many women were involved, with numbers ranging from as low as 20,000 (by Japanese historian Ikuhiko Hata[6]) to as high as 360,000 to 410,000 (by a Chinese scholar[7]); the exact numbers are still being researched and debated.[8] Most of the women were from occupied countries.

"Endless hierarchy


Before my current employer, I was with a 30,000+ employee hospital chain. When I wanted anything added to my job description or have my salary or title reviewed, it went to my Director, who sent it to a committee, who sent it to the department committee, who sent it to the department President, who then sent it to the inter-department committee for approval. The process took months upon months. I worked my last year there without an official title, because it was ""in process"" for the entire year. Anytime anyone wanted an update on an item, they were always told it was ""in process."" Towards the end, I realized that they just tell people that to keep them droning along and chasing the carrot on the end of the stick for as long as possible.

"Even Voldemort, at least per Rowling, isn't quite as bad as Hitler. (Even if they share parallels.)

This is because when (long story short) Rowling was researching orphanages for Voldemort's backstory for *Half-Blood Prince*, she actually found out that orphanages are incredibly shitty places where, most times, children are neglected, abused, and come out with a host of mental, emotional, and psychological problems. 

In many cases, children in orphanages are even sold into sexual slavery, or prostituted out to pedophiles. Orphanages can be pretty terrible places, and Rowling was abolutely *horrified* to see the abyssmal conditions for children at every orphanage she went to.

Due to this, she actually founded her main charity in an effort to eradicate them, and has strongly implied that she has since developed a much more sympathetic view of Voldemort. He did evil things, but Rowling has also stated that Tom Riddle's Voldemort persona was a direct result of growing up in an orphanage."

Family (especially Cersei) pushes him out of his morals, but aside from that he's a moral character.  The only fucked up stuff he does really is for Cersei (like the Bran thing, he didn't want to do anything about Bran, but Cersei insisted and to be fair Cersei would've been killed  if Bran told).  He also did Tyrion a really bad deed on orders from his father (which was excluded from the series, but was the driving force for why Tyrion killed his father.)

"I would argue that the band of the hawk didn't fail Griffith, he failed them. Everyone supported him because they belIeved in him and his goal, but Griffith fucked it up. First let's talk about Guts. Guts left the band because he respected Griffith immensely and wanted to be seen as his friend, which according to Griffiths own words, he would only consider someone that lets nothing stand in the way of their goals, not even him. In other words, an equal. Guts hears this and decides to leave the band so that he can ultimately be Griffiths friend. However, Griffith is full of shit and is too egotistical to actually follow through; I don't believe he was capable of actually having a friend that met his condition. Griffith never for a moment considers why Guts is leaving, and we see from his thoughts in the chapter that he sees Guts as a possession of his, and not a person. If he sees Guts of all people, who did so much for him, as an object that he owns, there is no way he sees the rest of the band of the hawk as anything more than a tool to use for his gain. They love and fight and die for him, and he sees them as objects. 

This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that it's Griffiths fault the band got fucked. Griffith chose to fuck the princess because he was pissed that one of his tools left him. He made a rash and stupid decision that ruined everything. As the leader of the band, he had a responsibility to act in the best interest of the goals of the band, which they were well on their way to achieving until he couldn't handle someone leaving him because they wanted to be his friend. 

So Griffith fucked everything up, and then the band STILL goes back to save him. The reason they waited is because they were all being hunted as criminals. So they save him, and Griffith betrays them all. 

That's why Griffith is the biggest asshole who ever lived. He was an egotiscal brat that only saw others as a means to an end, and even though he described how someone would be his friend, I don't think anyone in the berserk universe would be capable of being Griffiths friend. "

"Come on man, saying ""whose jizz started it"" is kind of reductionist, don't you think? If he'd gone into this knowing that he was essentially adopting a kid I'm sure he'd have a different outlook on it. It's the fact that there was a whole lie surrounding it, and that lie permeates everything in your home life. Everything you've used to help identify yourself is fundamentally changed - and one of the closest people to you *knew it*. Of course the fact that you raised him and cared for him should mean something, it should mean a lot of something, but can you imagine the conflicting feelings? It's not even remotely your son's fault, but he reminds you of that lie, just by virtue of what he looks like... and he can't do a damn thing about it. You have to sort that shit out before you can be a good father again - either you have to let go of your feelings about the lie, or resolve them otherwise.

"The death of my grandfather. It was the first time physically witnessing someone in my family die and it was frustrating. Frustrating because the hospital was at fault. He only visited the hospital for a fractured ankle from slipping on a wet rock and ended up catching pneumonia from another patient.  I noticed his symptoms early and I told the doctors that I thought he had pneumonia. They said they were SURE he didn't and said i shouldn't diagnose based off of google and sent him home the next day. He immediately collapsed when he got home and had to be taken away in the ambulance.  When he arrived in the ER he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was placed in the ICU. He had trouble breathing and surgery didn't help so he was placed on morphine in a deep sleep. He spent the next two months like that. The doctors that ignored my suggestion never came to see us, and never apologized. The nurses said they were ""busy"".When my mom finally pulled the plug, his nose and mouth had black bruising from where the breathing mask was.The most heartbreaking moment was when my mom looked at my grandfather's feet.  His nails were long and unkempt.  My grandfather has been a neat freak since his youth. My mom started crying because she realized he couldn't bend over to cut them anymore but he didn't want to ask us to help him because he thought it would trouble us.  To this day I HATE those doctors. It may/may not be their fault but I am still haunted by the fact that he would be alive if they had just listened to me."

He was fitted with a pacemaker and continued with his sports.

Second person was a guy I went to college with. He was one of the most athletic people I know without being obsessed with the gym. He adored sports and did triathlons just because or for charity. He was a good person. He was finishing one of his triathlons when he just dropped dead of cardiac arrest. This guy never did a drug in his life, he didn't drink and he died because his heart gave up on him. And they couldn't tell anybody a definitive reason why other than ""it just happens sometimes.""

"It's ""weird"" because, when people talk about Hitler, many think of a megalomaniacal madman who wanted space and power. In truth, he was a fiercely proud German who wanted his people's land back, and wanted to purify the race for their betterment. He didn't even want to kill the ones he saw as impure, as he tried to send away the Jews, disabled people, gypsies, etc. However, other nations saw them as the same burden that he did, and they sent them back. After that, the SS created and implemented the Final Solution. Hitler only wanted what was best for his people, and was, obviously, more than happy to have allies and cooperation with other nations.

I'm not a Nazi/Hitler apologist. Fuck that. However, we taint the past with romanticized versions of reality, and, due to that, we are unable to reapply the lessons taught in the past to the present and future. See the war through Hitler's lens, rather than simply the picture painted by the victor, and you realize that all sides had something to fight for, but not all of their visions were compatible in the end."

I think it's thorny only when it comes to children. When it comes to adults, I generally adopt a ""Your life, your choice"" attitude. if this was available, it wouldn't be so much about the impact on current trans people so much as future trans people.

If your child was trans, and you knew about it early enough... would you give them the treatment or would you wait for them to be older? Do you let them go through the dysphoria, with all the related problems until they can make a choice for themselves? Do you transition them to the other sex, which would bring about it's own problems with regards to suddenly being seen and treated very differently from what they had been?

I mean it's a big can of worms. Look, this is all based (as I said) on being able to take a pill and be a full female/male with absolutely no traces of your previous sex in any discernable way whatsoever. So I would assume that people would be less against it compared to now where if a man transitions post puberty, they will still have remnants of that testosterone burst and such stuff.

"Yeah, the the Free Speech clause of the 1st Amendment refers to what state and federal governments can/can't do to individuals, not what private businesses/private individuals can/can't do to individuals. The government can't stop a trademark because they think it's racist (new ruling from this year), but an individual can choose to stop associating with another group b/c of their actions (BDS movement, which is currently under attack from our government, not really hearing much from the ""free speech"" crowd on that). 

There is an interesting thing to be said in relation to the Pruneyard Shopping Center vs Robins SCOTUS case, which upheld the right to free speech in shopping centers and malls, arguing that although they are technically private property, they are the ""new town square"" and so you have the right to peacefully protest there. Could it be argued that the Internet is the ""new town square"", or even specific social media sites are (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc)? If so, then you could make such an argument. If it was the new town square, that would make huge parts of their business models illegal, b/c they would now be spying on and profiting off people's information in a quasi-public area. 

If you really want to make a legal argument that social media censorship is a violation of the 1st Amendment, you would have to fundamentally change the way social media works as a business model, and I don't know a single ""free speech"" advocate who has even bothered to think about it like that.

"Once there was a tree
and she loved a little boy.

And everyday the boy would come
and he would gather her leaves
and make them into crowns
and play king of the forest.

He would climb up her trunk
and swing from her branches
and eat apples.
And the apples stained his mouth a strange color
and it wasn’t green and it wasn’t red
and the stain wouldn’t go away
no matter how much his mother scrubbed his mouth
after he’d eaten them
(she loved the little boy very much)
And they would play hide-and-go-seek.

And when he was tired,
he would sleep in her shade.
(she loved him best when he was asleep)
(he never woke up with quite the same color eyes)
(and his mother hated to hug him after he came home from the tree)
(though she could never explain why)
And the boy loved the tree, very much.

And the tree was happy.
But time went by.
And the boy grew older.
And the tree was often alone.

Then one day the boy came to the tree
and the tree said, “Come, Boy, come and
climb up my trunk and swing from my
branches and eat apples and play in my
shade and be happy.”
And the boy did.
And it seemed to him that time passed differently
in the shadow of the tree
and it seemed to him that he felt dizzy
after only a few minutes of playing
but the sun was gone, just the same.
(the tree was a very giving tree)

Take my apples, Boy,” said the tree, “and sell them.
Then you will have money and
you will be happy.”
“No thank you,” the boy said politely. “I really
should be getting back to the city.”
“I insist,” said the tree,
and it seemed to the boy that the ground grew hot and hummed around him
and his wrists hurt and his throat hurt until his mouth opened
and he said “Yes”
and the tree purred.
Hand to God, the tree purred
and then he was sick in the bushes.

So the boy climbed up the
tree and gathered her apples
and carried them away.
And the tree was happy.
And the boy stayed feeling sick.

And the tree stood a little taller, and grew back
all of her apples,
and then some.
And the apples weren’t quite green
and they weren’t quite red.

But the boy stayed away for a long time….
and the tree was angry.

And then one day the boy came back
and the tree shook.
and she said, “Come, Boy, climb up my trunk
and swing from my branches and be happy.”
“Please,” said the boy.
“I have a home. I have a wife. I have a family,” he said.
I didn’t want to come back. I don’t–
I don’t remember how I got here.
Where are they? Have you seen them?”
“I have no house,” said the tree.
“I can’t remember their names,” said the boy
almost to himself.
“The forest is my house,” said the tree lightly,
so lightly the boy could almost think
he imagined hearing her voice.

“But you may cut off
my branches and build a
house. Then you will be happy.”
“Yes,” the boy said slowly,
“Then I will be happy.”

And so the boy cut off her branches
to build his house.
And he forgot the names of his wife
and his children
and the house outside the forest
(he had never been outside the forest)
and he ate nothing but apples
and grew thinner and more thin
and smiled every day
and fell down often
(he was so clumsy)
And the tree was happy.

But then one day the boy wandered a bit further than usual
and he crossed a stream
and as he crossed the stream his mind came back to itself.
And the boy ran. The boy ran and he shook and he ran and he vomited and he ran.

It took the police a week to find out his name
and his last known address
and his family cried
and he cried
and they hugged
and the tree knew where he was.

The boy stayed away for a long time.
And when he came back,
the tree was so happy
she could hardly speak.
“Come, Boy,” she whispered,
“come and play.”
“I am too old and sad to play,”
said the boy.
“No, you’re not,”
the tree said. “You’re just a boy.”
and for a minute it seemed to the boy
that she was right
and his knees didn’t ache
and his ears weren’t fogged
and he could almost hear his mother calling him home for dinner
instead of being dead and laid out in the ground
face turned up in the dirt
(which is where she really was)

“Cut down my trunk
and make a boat,” said the tree.
“Then you can sail away…
and be happy.”
And so the boy cut down her trunk
and made a boat and sailed away.
But even though the wind blew
and the waves slopped against the side of the boat
the boy knew he wasn’t going anywhere.
“I know this isn’t real,” he whispered
and he knew the tree was smiling
and he was right.
There was no boat.
And he had never left her,
she had never let him leave her,
not even when thought he had.
She had never let him really leave her.
And the tree was happy.

“I am sorry, Boy,”
said the tree,” but I have nothing
left to give you -”
“You have never given me anything,” the boy said.
“How long have you kept me here, really?”

The tree ignored the question. “My apples are gone.”
“My teeth are too weak
for apples,” said the boy. “Am I old? Did you let me grow old here, alone?”
“My branches are gone,”
said the tree. ” You
cannot swing on them – ”
“I am too old to swing
on branches,” realized the boy. “You let me
grow old here.”

“My trunk is gone, ” said the tree.
“You cannot climb – ”
“I am too tired to climb,” said the boy.
He was too tired even to hate her.
At least the tree was real.
“I am sorry,” sighed the tree.
“I wish that I could give you something….
but I have nothing left.
I am just an old stump.
I am sorry….”

You are not sorry, the boy thought to himself.
“I don’t need very much now,” said the boy.
“just a quiet place to sit and rest.
I am very tired.”
“Well,” said the tree, straightening
herself up as much as she could,
“well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting
Come, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest.”
And he was too tired to fight her.

And the boy sat.
And the tree was happy.
And he is still sitting there,
under the apples that are not quite green
and not quite red
and he has not moved for a long time
and the tree is very
very
very
very
very
(the tree is not a stump)
very
(the tree was never a stump)
very
very
very
(the tree has grown her branches back)
very
very
(the tree is looking for other boys)
happy.

I also feel that I'm not supposed to like Americans as much as I do. America imperialist, America arrogant blah blah blah. I'm not trying to make a political statement, I'm just trying to sing a nice song! 

I also sometimes feel like I like your language more than my own. Well, this is starting to sound too cryptic, so I'll go ahead and say that I'm Italian. Many people like the way Italian sounds and say that it is a beautiful language, but I like the way English sounds better."

BUT, I was responding to a suspicious car call on a side/dirt road. When my partner and I approached the car, I was on the driver side. We walked up on an adult man and his 6 year old daughter. What I saw startled me and disturbed me so much I dropped my flash light. My partner was higher ranked with more experience than me and was able to keep his composure better that I did. I cried a lot that night and the scene still troubles me even now 20 years later.

It's been so bad that I failed school because I didn't write a long essay (I'm talkin 15+ pages here) because I had panic attacks every time I thought about presenting it in front of the class. It usually went like this: I opened OpenOffice, I tried to write someting, I imagine how the class laughs about me fucking everything up, I close OpenOffice and started playing WoW to push away those thoughts.

Now that I am no longer in school I feel better. I have a lot less sleepless nights and I am trying to change something about myself. I try to talk more to people. I started cooking. Basic stuff like Schnitzel (I'm german, so that's basic for me), pancakes and scrambled eggs, nothing special. 

But I'm having fun with something else than gaming. I wrote some poems and good-night stories, I joined an (e)rp discord and I finally accepted who I am as a person.

Cats do not like eye contact unless they already love you. So, next time you're out and see your furry love... Look at it, and then slowly close your eyes, open them and turn away. Pay that cat no attention. Hold your hand out and make no noise. 

Act like everything in the world but that damn cat is interesting. If you do this right enough times, the cat will come to your hand, sniff it and maybe give a good rub against it. 

If the cat accepts you, you may gently stroke it, as long as you continue your slow blinking process. Those are as good as kisses in the feline world, and it's a show of trust. 

If the cat returns your ""kisses"", you've made a friend. If not? Cat doesn't like you. At all. Fuck off.

The part I cant get over is you have a NY City government. You can make every law you want for yourself. But no- it needs to be made state law even though its zero net change for the folks in the city. Which is easy on the politicians who get to pass bills that have no effect on their constituants and screw over people in other districts.

She has has her hand gripping my wrist, my had slipped free and the force of pulling away from her grip caused my hand to go towards her. One of my fingers happened to hit her right in the vagina area, and my finger went directly inside her vagina (outside of her shorts and panties, but still penetrated a good inch). I was completely shocked, and pulled away as if burned. She just was quiet as if pondering what to do or say. My wife and her parents were in the next room. We both just stopped what we were doing and never spoke of it again. We are still friends, she's happily married. But for a second I thought she would run tell her parents and our friendship and probably my life would have been ruined.

"What *is* true is that people vary widely in the amount of energy they have to exercise and cook healthy food, and in the amount of control they have over their diet (self control or control over external forces). People with depression, insomnia, anxiety, diabetes, etc., are likely to have less energy to exercise and eat healthy than those without. People with conditions like ADHD or anxiety may have a harder time sticking to a healthy diet, while people who don't control what they eat (i.e. students, children, and people who live in so-called ""food deserts"") may just not have healthy options. Thermodynamics don't lie, but it is *not* equally easy for everyone to be fit and healthy. "

"It's like that for the most part across US grocery stores, and most butchers will wrap in paper for the same sort of effect.

I don't mind it though because in reality you should be taking a paper towel and ""drying"" your meat before you throw it in that sizzling hot pan anyway. It helps it to get the proper sear and not stick when you are using a pan.

Never knew that it wasn't blood though. I mean you even hear guys like Gordon Ramsay say shit like, ""it's swimming in a pool of blood, you could take it back out to graze it's so fucking raw!""

The fact that it's actually a ""binding protein found in muscle tissue"" makes a LOT more sense for why letting a steak rest is so important to it not losing all its juices to the plate. You let it sit after cooking and the myoglobin binds back into the tissue, whereas when still fresh out of the pan or off the grill it has all been extracted in a way and will leak out if you cut into the steak too soon."

"Which song? Train in Vain?

&gt;When the London Calling album was released, many fans assumed it was called ""Stand by Me"",[4] but the meaning of the song's title is obscure as the title phrase cannot be found in the lyrics. Mick Jones, who wrote most of the song, offered this explanation: ""The track was like a train rhythm, and there was, once again, that feeling of being lost.""[1]

&gt;""Train in Vain"" is a love song,[7] with an almost country-and-western lyric that echoes Tammy Wynette's ""Stand by Your Man"".[1] The song has been interpreted by some as a response to ""Typical Girls"" by the Slits, which mentions girls standing by their men. Mick Jones split up with Slits guitarist Viv Albertine shortly before he wrote the song.[8]

&gt;The song has often interpreted to be about Jones' volatile relationship with the Slitsguitarist Viv Albertine who commented ""I'm really proud to have inspired that but often he won't admit to it. He used to get the train to my place in Shepherds Bush and I would not let him in. He was bleating on the doorstep. That was cruel"".[9] The couple separated around the time of the London Callingrecording sessions."

"Generally most people put Eminem in that top tier (anywhere from #1-#10) in most list.  I personally have him a bit toward the middle/lower half (5-6) on my list mainly because of how mediocre his albums have been for the past maybe 10 years.

There is also the issue of race.  Em is the best selling hip-hop artist of all time by a long shot and while his talent is undeniable and he's one of the GOATS, he doesn't sell nearly as many albums if he's not white. The white population definitely gravitated toward him much more than any other hip-hop artist ever.  [Oddly enough a heat map game out recently showing where he's most popular](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/upshot/music-fandom-maps.html).

He's #11 but it basically says ""*His fan base is strongest in whiter and more rural places: West Virginia; southern Ohio; eastern Kentucky; deep north Maine; the Ozarks in Missouri; across the Great Plains. And, of course, Eminem is popular in his hometown, Detroit.""*

I'm black and one thing I always remember in high school (was nearly 99% black student body) was talking about Eminem. While everybody acknowledged him as a great rapper most of us didn't really like his ""wacky"" radio records.  ""My Name Is"", Just Lose It, ""Without Me"", ""Real Slim Shady"" shit like that didn't get played at parties growing. But stuff like Nail in the Coffin, his verse on the Hail Mary diss to Ja Rule, his features on 50 Cents album, stuff like that was amazing.  

My personal ranking is 

1) Jay-Z

2) Nas

3) Rakim

4) 3k (Andre 3000)

5) Eminem

6-10 varies on my mood/the day) . Big, Pac, DMX, T.I, Kanye

And the argument also varies if I'm just talking about best MC/lyricist  vs best hip-hop artist.  Cause I think a guy like Mos Def is a better lyricist than Kanye but Kanye makes more music that I want to listen to on the regular.  "

"This is a terrible idea. Tinder keeps track of your activity and rates you based on a number of factors, including how desperate you are (number of swipes) and how many of those right-swiped people swiped you back. Swiping right on everything is a surefire way of getting the lowest ranking. Tinder shows your profile to people of similar ranking, so you'll quickly find that you simply aren't getting any decent people in your queue. 

The best way to make Tinder work for you is to swipe right only people you actually have a shot with. Be honest with yourself about the kind of women you can pull, and focus on them. If you behave like a desperate loser, Tinder algorithms will detect that and match you up with desperate losers, and you'll totally deserve it. "
"Keep looking for scholarships. Apply for grants. DO NOT buy textbooks at the student store! Get a part-time job to cover your living situation. GO TO OFFICE HOURS.

He has a really great personality, nice smile, and brings a lot of energy to the office... which is nice compared to the other guy that sits next to me and schedules Microsoft Outlook meetings for group suicides.  Brad is the kinda guy that was hired for his enthusiasm and because he's great eye candy.  


One day, I'm at the coffee machine grabbing an espresso after a long weekend and Brad comes up behind me.  I felt his breath against my neck, or maybe I hoped I did.  After what seems like an eternity, my espresso is finished and I move to the side to allow Brad entry (ugh).  He looks down at the machine and thinks ""I guess now is a good time to clean it.""  Even though there is a sign on the machine that says not to open it unless you're the maintenance man.  He does and I suppose he accidentally hit the brew coffee button as well at some point and coffee spurts everywhere.  It's like a murder scene, but with coffee.  There's coffee all over me, in my hair, all over him, all over the floor, the ceiling, the walls.  It's a nightmare.  


As he runs over to grab napkins, I'm frozen in sheer horror.  He comes back and taps me and asks ""are you okay? here's some napkins.""  I'm not even moving or acknowledging him. He then starts dabbing the coffee off me.  He's dabbing my hair, my face, my shirt, my pants... next thing you know I'm waking up.  I must've passed out from the pure excitement of it all or maybe the blood rushing to different parts of my body.  The only thing that would've made it better is if he had been giving me ""CPR.""

Every ~10,000 years, a galactic council of advanced alien species deploys a task force to Earth to knock us back to the stone age to prevent us from expanding throughout the galaxy. My story picks up when that alien task force arrives at Earth to ""deter"" us for a third time...only this time they arrive to find an armada of space-faring vessels waiting for them. I love musing on the mysteries and wonders of the cosmos, and that plays a significant role in the story itself.

If you enjoy ruminating on the incomprehensible nature of the universe, here's an excerpt from Part 12 as an example:
______________

“There. Do you see it?”

Sarah squinted her eyes as she gazed at the night sky, fruitlessly attempting to identify just what it was her father was pointing to.

“Well?” Her father prodded. 

“No, daddy,” Sarah finally replied, a tinge of defeat in her voice. “There are so many of them.”

Her father smiled and chuckled as he put his arm around her.

“Exactly,” he said, again pointing to the night sky. He gave her a soft nudge. “Go on.”

Sarah followed suit, raising her arm as if trying to touch the stars.

“Now do you see it?” He asked.

“See what?” 

“Everything,” he said. He knelt down beside her and gently brought her closer. “There, at the very tip of your finger, are countless stars just like our own. Hundreds, thousands, millions, all at the tip of your finger.”

It was a temperate, cloudless night, with only a soft breeze disturbing the silence. 

“But each and every one of those stars are in fact giants of creation. From here, they are but the size of your fingertip. Were you to see them up close, their sheer size would exceed the scope of your own eyes.”

Sarah’s young mind gradually began to grasp the wonder her father was trying to instill in her.

“And with each of those many stars are likely even more planets, and some of those planets just might have a father and his daughter pointing their fingers at the same night sky and staring in awe at the same spectacle.”

“But daddy, didn’t people from those planets come here to harm us?” Sarah asked.

“Yes,” her father replied bluntly. He maintained the smile on his face, but his voice turned somber. “It is a sad thing, and something we perhaps do not entirely understand.”

Her father sighed as he placed his hand on the wrist of Sarah’s outstretched arm, guiding it back down to her side. He took her shoulders in both hands and lightly turned her to face him. 

“For whatever reason those people wanted to harm us, never let it overshadow what is at the very tip of your finger: millions of stars and billions of worlds; opportunity, wonder, discovery, understanding. Never let the actions of strangers dictate your path forward and how you decide to make your way beyond the only star we have ever known.”

Sarah stared into her father’s eyes, his soft smile providing her a sense of comfort.

“One day soon, we will be able to travel to those stars. We will be able to see for ourselves a pinprick of light become a behemoth of power. It pains me that I will likely not live to see that day, yet it also brings me great joy to know that it is what your future holds.”

Her father turned his head back towards the sky and Sarah followed his lead. 

“Whether you choose to venture to those stars will be your decision,” her father continued. “But if you do decide to take that leap, I hope you remember this moment. I hope you remember that no one – friend or foe – should dictate why you do so. Out there, where specks are titans, lies limitless possibilities. Wherever humanity’s future might take us, never forget that your future is your own.”

Sarah momentarily lost herself as her father’s words echoed and washed over her. Suddenly, she felt her feet leaving the ground. She looked to her left, but her father was nowhere to be seen.

“Daddy?” she called out, panic creeping into her voice. She ascended higher and higher towards the sky, climbing faster and faster as she went. 

“Daddy!?” she cried out again, unable to suppress the fear enveloping her. 

Soon, the grassy field she had been standing in alongside her father grew into an entire continent. She could see the oceans and the concentrations of bright yellow lights marking mankind’s largest cities. Before she knew it, she was looking down on the Earth as a whole, soaring past one of the many habitable space stations in its orbit. 

She looked ahead and saw that she was heading right for the Sun. She wanted so badly to stop, but whatever it was propelling her forward was out of her control. She was at the mercy of forces unknown. 

Sarah spun around and looked back towards the Earth, growing smaller by the second. A sense of dread tightened its grip on her as she saw enormous dark purple tendrils sprout from her home planet in every direction, stretching themselves into the darkness of space. 

She looked back at the Sun, now so large that it took up her entire field of view. She was heading right for its center, and just as she began to fear that she would be burned to ashes, the tendrils raced ahead of her and pierced the Sun itself. Within the blink of an eye, the Sun evaporated, leaving the entirety of Sol in pitch blackness.

Still, Sarah continued to soar into the unknown at an ever-increasing speed. She crossed the unimaginable expanses of empty space before arriving at more stars. She approached a star as blue as an ocean and another star as red as blood. Yet each star she visited, the tendrils followed, and each star met the same fate as the Sun. Everywhere she went, the light was extinguished.

She hurdled further onward towards the center of the galaxy; a region of space perpetually bathed in starlight.

“No!” she cried out. She knew that if she reached that area, so too would the tendrils, and she would bring darkness to a place that had never known the absence of light. She was powerless to do anything to stop it, yet she felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and despair all the same.

“Daddy!” she screamed. “Please! Help! We have to stop! We have to stop! We have to stop! We have to…”"
"That's because when pirates were around, they would constantly be dropping booty, debris, whatever into the ocean that would sink. This caused the cold water from the bottom of the ocean to rise, which kept the ocean colder. Now that pirates are gone, the top of the ocean stays hotter.

"Right after school one day, my boyfriend came to pick me up from my high school (he went to a different school). It was very hot and I needed to put my hair up, so I did and a few hairs were sticking out and I told him, ""I would love you forever if you got me a bobby pin."" He just said ""ok"" and we went to Rite Aid to get ice cream. I didn't feel like going inside to get it so he went down to get us some ice cream and he came back with bobby pins. I got so happy ( I was 16 and it felt like a big deal). After that day every time we had a small argument he would always surprise me with a pack of bobby pins and say ""love me forever"". 7 years later and I have over 20 packs of bobby pins and we are a few months away from our wedding.

"I have autism and damn do I hate Autism Speaks, or A$ as the community calls it. There's a lot of shitty things they've done, but the one that stuck with me was this: they interviewed a mother of an Autistic girl. The mother talked about how she often thought of killing her daughter because of how much the mother was suffering. They ran the interview as part of an ad campaign where they talked about how everyone who has to deal with a person with autism has these thoughts. Two days after the interview aired, the mother killed her daughter and herself. A$ released a statement in which they basically said that they felt for the mother and everyone thinks like that. No sympathy for the child who will never even turn 8.

One of the board members mentioned how she wanted to drive herself and her autistic daughter off a bridge, and only didn't because of how it would affect her non-autistic daughter. She said all of this in front of her autistic daughter.

They also added a lot to the antivax movement, although the current official story is that they are no longer involved and do not believe that vaccines cause autism. Either way, a lot of the reason that parents are scared enough of autism to not get their kid vaccinated is because of A$'s fear mongering.

If nothing else tells you how shit of a company this is, no one in their upper management has autism. Everyone is someone who has ""had to deal with"" someone with autism. For a group named Autism Speaks, you'd think maybe they'd actually let autistic people speak and listen to them but no. They regularly steal art/stories from autistic people without the artist/writer's permission, and when they tell A$ to take it down, A$ refuses, tells the creator to ""donate"" money to them, or ignores them all together. 

TLDR: Autism Speaks is a shit company that normalises killing children, helped build up the antivax movement, and does the exact opposite of its name.

After we broke up and she moved out she started telling people (lots of friends of mine/mutual friends of ours) that i had been hitting her, that I would apparently push her and scream at her. None of it was true - but she tried her hardest to get people involved and get me bashed (to no avail luckily) and then about 6 weeks after she moved out she fell pregnant to a guy who lived in the apartment above me.

The mathematician thinks for a moment, then answers. ""I fill my official firefighting bucket with water from the local hydrant, and I put out the fire.""

""Good, good!"" says the chief. ""Okay. Next scenario. You are walking down the street, and you look in the alley and you see a dumpster, and it's *not* on fire. What do you do?""
