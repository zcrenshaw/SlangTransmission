I'm still with it. It's the children who are wrong.
"The Incredibles. The dad just wants to take care of his family after losing his job, is flawed,  insecure and not sure if he can handle it. The family actually *supports* him, and Ms. I and him wind up with a stronger marriage in the end, along with the kids seeing their parents in a new and better light."
"Sort of related, my parents have the same birthday. I definitely thought parents were mythological beings who had the same birthday."
"My parents had the same last name even before their marriage, so I used to think you have to have the same last name as someone to marry them."
"Hey... from a firefighter and a man who has lost his mom.  I am truly sorry for your loss.  

As a FireMarshal I have experience in talking with families of fire victims. First off, know your mom most likely didn’t suffer in pain. I say that because most fire victims pass from carbon monoxide before fire ever gets to them. Passing in that way is like passing in your sleep. 

Secondly, make sure you grieve properly. Don’t hold it in.   Go through all processes of grieving, your mom was worth it.  

Third, set yourself up with support quickly. Friends, other relatives, church ... even the firefighters need to be looked after as this is very hard on them as well. 

Again OP I am sorry for your mom, you and your family. Your mom is with you forever in your heart and soul, don’t let that go! "
"Not that much. I have a wife I get to regularly stick my dick inside, which we both enjoy. "
No. Seems like too much work. 
"My father told nobody about his vasectomy after my parents got divorced.

Ten years later, his girlfriend told him she was pregnant, and he just picked up his shit and started walking out. She flipped her shit, screaming about him leaving her and his baby, and he coldly replied  ""if you're pregnant, it means you've been fucking someone else, because I got cut 12 years ago, and I've had multiple tests since then to confirm that I'm shooting blanks"".

She wasn't pregnant. She was lying to him to manipulate him. End of relationship."
Tell her this isn't a shitty Apple commercial and that she has a computing device.
"So I have been with the same woman since 1972, I was in emotional love and physical lust when we got together and we basically stayed there till we got pregnant. Our sex life came back as having the baby became routine, same for baby two and three. As we got older we had dry spells sexually. We would switch to emotional love making, a lot of talking and cuddling and taking time for diner just us. Sex would come back and we would go back that direction for a while. My wife eventually had a medical issue and went through the change,  things went back and forth again. I had my hips replaced and things swung again. If you just learn early to love unconditionally minor bumps like this mean nothing."
"I hate that ad so much. Everything about it screams ""this ad was made by a complete asshole."""
"Nah. Been thinking about fucking my wife all day. Looking forward to this evening when I can make it a reality.

Been nearly 16 years of fucking at this point, and it's only getting better."

I'm 27. I hung out with a 20 year old who didn't understand a single movie reference I made. 
"My (older) brother lived nearly his entire life in a wheelchair. Our house had wheelchair accommodations throughout; a wheelchair-accessible shower, wider doorways, lower sinks, etc. For me growing up this was perfectly normal. When I started visiting friends' houses I thought it was weird that the sink was so high, or the shower had such a tall step-over. When I would ask ""how does someone in a wheelchair use this"" I was looked at like I was an alien and told ""but nobody here is in a wheelchair""."
"I mean if he asks you out he's into you, but that doesn't necessarily mean he isn't if he doesn't."
"Well, it's a little bleak, but I found out that not everyone is told by their parents what they like, who they are friends with and what they should do with their lives. Turns out I had some serious helicopter parents"
"When someone referred to Instagram as ""Insta"", I knew that the world had passed me by. "
"In college I used to wait until I got *really* hungry, and eat a couple of Tums. Held me over until my next meal."
Lingering thoughts and existential worries while I'm trying to fall asleep
"Adding $500 to ""Free Parking"" every time someone lands on it."
Three comments so far and all of them talk about still diggin’ the missus. This gives me a bit of faith in marriage. 
"Not talking. I live with a mom and dad that are immigrants and are quite encapsulated in their own bubble. I grew older and ventured out, but mom and dad follow a steady schedule of coming home from work, sleeping till dinner, waking up, then watching tv. Their only source of information is from the news radio. Both of them didn't finish beyond high school, and my dad didn't even bother finishing his schooling because my grandma was a separate headcase. 

They also didn't have moral leadership to talk/teach about anything (being confident, showing compassion to others, understanding and being with resilient with failure, etc life lessons). The only thing they ever taught was to obey elders and show respect. Every thing else, they just weren't accustomed to. 

It blew my mind when I realized other families had actual friendships between family members, and people can actually talk about these things to their parents about life. I would never bring up anything about dating, career politics, and social dilemmas with my parents. I've tried during my younger days and they'd simply ask ""what's the big deal? its just friends/work/bullying/nonsense"". 

"
"If I had a dollar for everytime I didn't ask a girl out, allthough being attracted to her... I had a shit load of dollars.  
My current relationship of 5 years started with her making the first move (and we knew each other for quite some time before).  
All in all, that statement is stupid and wrong. "
I'd probably put a little cover-up or some base shit on the occasional blemish and thin out the bags under my eyes. That way people will stop saying I look like I'm drunk even when I'm completely sober.

The stupid fucking bitch waltzing around brooklyn or whatever the fuck with her stupid ass fucking ipad acting like she owns the fucking world. Nobody gives a fuck about his broken arm. And what the fuck is that shit in the taco shop where she slaps the fucking iPad down like a fucking viking. Fuck you. Then she sits on a fucking tree making some dumb fucking bug poster for no fucking reason I wish she fell out of that fucking tree. and finally she gets home and her nice fucking neighbor asks her a simple ass question

"YouTube personalities, 'social influencers', instagram models. Like, shit.  "
Been married 34 years. Sat on the edge of the bed this morning and squeezed my wife’s ass and buried my face in her hooters as she was getting dressed for work. I’m fantasizing about her now. 
"Sometimes you cant.  
Im a guy who doesn't like one night stands they feel awkward to me. I only want to get intimate with girls who I have an emotional connection with, plus it makes performance way easier."
"If I remember correctly, she thinks he's cheating on her, but then actually realized he wasn't and didn't hold against him. Thats s great positive too imo.

Honestly my opinion of the movie has changed so much since it came out when I was a kid. There's so much allegory for wasted potential, or getting old. Bob goes from being The Guy™ to having to work at a desk job, being miserable, having a family he cares about, and then lying to go out and listen to police scanners with his bud from the old days.

I used to Relate more to violet and kind of just saw Bob as a superhero who was down on his luck, to really relating more with Bob because really that's how life CAN go."
Ask her how she wants you to support her in reaching her goal.

"When I was a kid, we would sit down at the dinner table with books. Every person would have their own book out at the table while we ate. "
"My family orders an entire pizza for every member of the family. All of my close friends just order 1 or 2 pizzas for the whole family and they have to compromise on toppings/crust/whatever. Sounds like hell to me ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Fathers actually take interest in their kids lives

"Girls seem to like my dick size, so I'm happy about that.

"My wife absolutely despises my car. It's an egregious pile of shit, and she wants me to trade it in and get a better one.

My commute is less than 10 minutes. I bought the car with cash. Every month that I don't have to make a car payment is a month that the money can go toward the family that we will be starting. It is such an easy decision for me, even if the car's paint is falling off, the moonroof is sealed with caulk, half the windows don't work, the body damage, and so on.

Especially since she wants to remodel the house. That car payment I'm not making sure is a great help in affording a bathroom that doesn't look like ass, isn't it?

---

It's not a big deal, and the fact that this is the biggest conflict in our relationship means that we're pretty well-off. She also gets that while money isn't tight, the entire reason why money *isn't* tight is that I don't buy new cars when I don't have to."

"When I was in community college I had to take a speech class. The class was very easy and was taught by an older professor from a French-speaking part of Maine. Anyway the professor was nice but he was very clearly losing his marbles, he was at least 80 and sometimes he’d have these weird outbursts about random topics. The outbursts wouldn’t be malicious at all, but his wife who I don’t believe was even a teacher would basically have to teach 75% of the class as his assistant. From what I could gather the professor was still pretty good at the applications of the class, but everything else like class discussions were led by the wife.

They mentioned that they had met in Chicago after the Korean War, so they had been together since at least the 50’s. One day as I was walking on campus I saw them walking to the parking garage together, holding hands and singing a little song together in French. He even twirled her around and they stopped to gather themselves as they laughed."
"I'm 28. When I went in to substitute my first class, not a single one of the students were dressed in a way that would be considered rebellious/counterculture. No Mohawks, no guys with long hair and illegible band shirts, etc. In general, kids these days don't seem to be rebellious. It's weird tbh, my generation, gen X, and the baby boomers all had their counter culture and rebellious youths. I hear kids these days are having less sex, do less drugs, party less, and are even getting their driver's licenses later in life. WTF, it should be the exact opposite."
"I hate that commercial because it's classic Apple trying to disassociate themselves from the rest of the tech world like they aren't just wrapping up an inferior product in shiny casing and calling it ""revolutionary"".

I know it's one of those ""How do I human?"" sorts of questions, but it seems most of the dudes in here think romantic human interaction is as simple as walking up to a girl and pressing the action button, after having completed the [obtain job] and [exercise regularly] sidequests.

My advice to OP is to get out more and talk to real people away from computers and TV and whatnot. Ask a girl, or really anyone, to go on a hike or to a museum or something. Talk about your lives and not what movies you've seen recently. If you want to think about people as real people, then treat them that way."
"Put a set of scales next to the bed so that every morning when she gets up she'll stand straight on them. Make sure you wake up before her and sit next to the scales with a notepad.

I'm 26. I'm going back for my second bachelor's degree and I was in a communications class which is one of the first classes people take in their course of study. My teacher made a Mister Rogers reference and everybody just looked at him blankly. He threw his arms up in the air and chastised all of the 18 year olds for not knowing who mr. Rogers is. I couldn't believe mr. Rogers has disappeared so quickly from popular culture.

"The Grey. 

We all die. The world is going to kill us no matter what we do. So what is a man to do in the face of inevitability?

Do we pretend that we're not afraid, or do we recognize the fear and go on anyway? Do we sit aside and watch as someone chooses to steal, or do we stop it because we choose to live in a world where stealing isn't tolerated? Do we choose to let our friends suffer, or do we choose to help them? Do we choose to give in to despair after our loved ones die, or do we choose to go on even though the despair never really leaves us? 

In the end, we must watch our world collapse. Our friends and loved ones will get sick, they'll die, they'll leave us. Nothing we do will stop that. But until that happens we have a choice. And all men must choose.

"That was my normal too. My family is pretty casual about nudity so seeing my mom or dad was no big deal at all. I thought it was weird when other kids would freak out if they accidentally saw a parent in the buff.

"What good movie? Good sir, try ""What good trilogy?"" And I'll gladly tell you **Lord of the Rings**! They bring up the good and bad sides of men, and show how the good guys prevail in the end. If you think about it, LotR is largely about men doing masculine man stuff, and the trilogy has few women. It doesn't even pass the Bechdel test.

**Brotherhood**  
I don't even have to tell you about all the strong brotherly friendships in lotr. sam/frodo, pippin/merry, gimli/legolas.. But it also shows the toxicity of brother-dynamics in Boromir/Faramir/Denethor.


**Responsibility**  
Frodo takes on the ring because he realizes he has to act to keep his world safe, even if he is but a little young hobbit

**Sacrifice**  
Gimli: ""Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for?""

Aragorn was ready to sacrifice the entire army of men to give frodo and sam some more time

**Leadership**  
The trilogy is filled with wise men who lead their people. Kings, Wizards, a hobbit.. Ents, heck, even eagles.

Theoden: ""I'm proud, where was gondor? We won't help them since they didn't help us""

Gandalf: ""Be the bigger man and save the world""

Theoden: ""Alright, I can't argue with that beard""


**Courage**  
Sam the Man! Don't mess with his friends, he might just be a gardener, but he's there when his friends need him, even if it's dangerous. Like infiltrating an orc barrack to retrieve is friend.


**Mercy**  
Gollum might be a sneak, but Frodo rises above everyone elses disgust and instead pities Gollum. It's easy to hate those below you, but Frodo understands Gollums struggles and doesn't judge him over his (ring) addiction

"Your friends are so egregiously wrong that I'm almost embarrassed for them. Is it primarily your girl friends or your guy friends that are saying this? I would bet money that it's your girl friends.

The nice thing about universal statements like this is that it is trivial to prove false. ""ALL guys will approach you if they like you"" is utterly destroyed by me saying, as a guy, that I definitely do not approach all women who I like. There can be any number of reasons, but the most common is that I have no confidence that she would accept. It can be incredibly difficult and stressful to ask someone out and I don't have the energy to do that literally every fucking day. "
"I was very fortunate to have met such a wonderful woman at that point in my life. When I came home from Vietnam I was a drug addict and I hated the entire world. I had a serious chip on my shoulder because of the way we were treated by politics and even our own people. I needed two years to sort my head and walk the earth and in that time I was able to forgive and forget, I learned to communicate better and I made my peace. I went into dating with an open mind and heart, I didn't put up walls or hide anything, I just wanted to be accepted for me. My wife to be understood, her dad was a Korean war vet, she saw the changes men go through in that life. I felt like I won the lottery, I had a good steady job and we had a nice apartment it didn't get much better. Well I was wrong, it only got better when my boys were born. We soon began to take in foster kids and things got even better! My wife had trained as a nurse and I was a paramedic in NYC and peace officer in a small town, so money was good and we had a solid relationship and a home full of love. We weathered our little storms together and really enjoyed one anothers company now 3 boys and 30 fosters later were enjoying our grandkids, we have one foster boy left and he is in 9th grade. As soon as he decides what direction he wants to go mom and I will live for ourselfs secure in the knowledge we did good for others and left the world just a tad better then we found it."
"My mom is a bit of a hoarder. It was strange to me that you could just throw something away when you had no real use for it any more. Growing up, that meant you just hadn’t thought hard enough about what you could do with something.

Just curious as to where we've seen this.  Any links?  Did they spell my name right?  Can I put this on a resume?  Maybe get a framed copy for my mom?

"Not my family, but my best friend's growing up...

They never closed bathroom doors when using the bathroom. I was at my friend's house one time when he wasn't there one day (he went out for an errand, I was going to sit there and play Nintendo and wait for him). I went to the main bathroom to wash my hands. It was a fairly big and long bathroom, I just walked in and started washing my hands, when I heard a stifled giggling. I looked over to my left, and there is his mom, sitting on the toilet!

I apologized profusely, and ran out of there. She just laughed. "

"My dad would go into hour long fits of rage at least once every few months where he screamed at us and we were required to either not respond or agree with the terms le accusations that he hurled at us out of fear of him getting more angry and hitting us. We would then have to pretend it never happened or it would start all over again. It wasn't until I was a grown adult that I realized other families didn't do this, and I still have a hard time to this day standing up for myself. But I'm getting better at it.

Edit: Since this is getting some attention, I'd like to give a shameless shoutout to r/raisedbynarcissists . It's a great way to learn tips for dealing with abusive parents and learning to rationalize their behaviour without putting that blame on yourself. "
"I like the fact that the dad isn't portrayed as the ""bumbling dad"" as fathers often are. He's real and has issues that real people deal with, not as young as he used to be, misses his glory days, and now unemployed has to figure out how to take care of his family. He struggles, and has to come to the realization that he can't do it alone and needs his wife/family to support him. The best part is that they do, but not with the ""you can't do anything without your wife telling you what to do"" or mocking him. In my top 10 movies."

"Start with the obvious here - comparing your dick to porn dicks is like comparing your height with NBA players

The male porn performer is a guy with an above average dick who can get hard in a room full of strangers and bang someone for money AND has a desire to do so.

There's goddamn reasons you see the same handful of dudes in porn.

And that's also before we get in to trickery.  A lot of porn actresses are tiny.  Especially in Big Dick porn.  We're talking under five foot tiny.  Weigh goddamn nothing.  You put a woman who's 4'10"" and 95 pounds on a fat day next to a six and a half inch dick and you assume she's 5'6"".... well, that dick's gonna look like it's a foot long, or larger.

They also like to film with lenses that distort the image, making objects in the center of the frame appear larger.

Odds are your dick is just normal.  "
"&gt; . Sixteen-year-old me of course took that as a sign it was meant to be. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t.

"Alright, here's an answer that wasn't just ""She got fat"".

I've dated women who just make sex fucking difficult and humiliating.  It's just arduous before, during, after.  I don't even like to talk about it because the obvious response from the peanut gallery is ""Get better at sex loser!"".  I've been with women where the sex was easier and more satisfactory for both of us.

But it's crap like making it blatantly transactional.  Oh, you want to have sex tonight?  Well maybe if you do the dishes, fix my computer, make the bed, etc etc etc, I'll feel relaxed enough.

Or just the blatant double standards.  The list of things she won't do goes on forever.  Won't do doggy style.  Won't give head.  But then she turns around and expects to be eaten out for hours, and still find something to complain about.  I said a blowjob could use a little less teeth once and hadn't gotten blown in 5 years.

Or just the impracticality of the complaints.  Good sex is a skill that requires practice.  She doesn't fuck me more than once a month, so I get worse at it.  She complains that the sex wasn't as good as it used to be, so I say maybe we need to have sex more often, which she then takes personally.  But I'm not allowed to take personally that she just said point blank to my face that the sex wasn't as good?  She's half of this equation too.

Or the aftermath just isn't fucking worth it.  We have sex, and she's so overly sensitive to everything for the next day or two, the cost benefit of 20 minutes of pleasure vs 48 hours of walking on eggshells just isn't worth it.  I don't know what it is about sex with some woman, but afterwards they act like their shit doesn't stink and they need to be treated like princesses to validate their decision to have spread their legs that one time.  They just let that they allowed someone to have sex with them go to their head.  Like they did them a fucking favor, and now they're owed reverence and awe."

"Probably not. 

I'm cheap, I'm lazy, I'm fine with my skin as is, and I don't trust myself with something like mascara near my eye.

The amount of effort I see some of my female friends go through to put their faces on is ridiculous. Contouring, lashes, blush, eye liner etc. I like being able to go from bed to out the door in under 15 minutes and looking decent if I need to.

The amount of money I see them spend on makeup is also crazy. 

Also the vicious circle of them breaking out, then using makeup to cover it up, and then the makeup blocking pores and maybe causing worse skin conditions."

"If i pass her something I don't let go of it. My daughter does something worse: when she passes me something she holds it too low so I have to bend down (with my back! I ask you!) and then drops it before I have hold of it.

Zombie attack. I have a vacant face, not looking at her, walking past her whilst swinging my arm out horizontally to hit her in the chest. It sounds horribly violent, and it is, but it amuses her.

When she's telling me a story I interrupt her with the words, ""Go on."" This is good because it throws people. they're like, but I am already telling you! It's like the Kings of Peon telling me to lay where I am laying. But I am already laying there! I can't lay there more than I already am!

Walking through doors I always gesture for her to go first then try to go through at the same time. We do sometimes hurt each other with that.

Similarly if she goes to put a light on I try to get to the switch first unless she stops because I am going for it, then I stop too. In the bedroom she likes me to turn the big light off when she's got her little light on, as part of her routine, but I do it a second too early, so she can't find the switch on her lamp in the dark.

I hide a big picture of Nick Cake (from the Bad Sieves) somewhere she doesn't often look, so she'll open a cupboard an be surprised by his surly goth face. When she finds it it's her turn to hide it.

She has a padded sports bra for her martial arts. I do all the washing. I put both pads back in one cup.

She's really forgetful about what she's read, so I always move her bookmark back four pages. It takes her forever to finish a novel.

Always mispronounce band names. Can you believe Simply Minds are still touring?

If she's got her legs crossed on the sofa I flick her slipper off her foot.

She often can't find her clothes, due to not being able to look under things (it's a mental block). I always help, shout that I can't find the item, then come back in the room wearing it.

Clip a clothes peg onto her cardigan somewhere when I hug her.

When she tells me how no-one has listened to her all day I pretend I haven't heard her. I try to see how many times I can get her to repeat herself in telling me no-one listens to her.

I tell her how much I love parts of her body that she hates. Like her back chub. IT'S LIKE AN EXTRA, FREE, TINY ARSE.

Turn and loudly tell her I love her. When we're standing near each other at our martial arts class.

Edit: There's more.

If I ask her to throw something to me I put my hands out towards her but when she throws whatever it is I don't move at all so it just goes past me, hits me in the face, or bounces off my hands.

She complained about being unable to read my writing on the shopping list so for our next shop I wrote something deliberately badly and she spent several minutes in the supermarket trying to decipher it until she worked out it actually said, ""Sasquatch venom"". Which even Sainsbury's don't stock.

She's looked at this thread. She didn't know I did the bra thing on purpose. She thought I didn't understand how a sports bra works. I've told her I put both pads on my second favourite boob's side. ""You know, the smaller one."""

Then one day a friend of mine was telling me this story about how she accidentally saw her father naked one time and she was so grossed out, and I told her “what? I see mine naked on a daily base” and she was like *EEEEWWW*! Apparently not everyone’s father has no problem walking around the house naked while looking for his boxers..."

"It's obviously untrue. You think every guy makes a move on every woman he likes? We got shit to do.

And it should be more than obvious that getting what you want is way better than just getting what's given to you.

Edit: your friends, and this kind of attitude, is really dickish and toxic. All this assumes you're giving him lots of signals that you are interested too, because a guy will very rarely make a move until he is reasonably certain of the outcome. And if he misses all the ""hints"", and you feel he likes you, why not go the extra distance and be a bit more direct, instead of wondering forever what could have been. It's also a really passive way to absolve yourself of responsibility for your single status, shifting the blame on guys. Lets not pretend like you have nothing to do with that.

"She would totally donate the jars! That’s why she’s keeping them!

"That book *What to Expect When You're Expecting"" is pretty much the gold standard for learning about pregnancy. 

Also, and I hate to be a downer, but roughly 20% of pregnancies end up in a miscarriage. There really isn't a lot of information on why it happens or how to prevent it. It just happens sometimes. It's a good idea to keep the pregnancy to yourselves and your doctor until about 12 weeks in. If it happens and everyone knows about the pregnancy you'll end up reliving it every time you have to tell someone that your wife isn't pregnant anymore.

On a happier note just get ready to be a father. None of us know what we're doing, so just learn what you can wing the rest and love that little bugger."

"My dad walking around the house naked and being pretty sexually transparent until I was like 15.

His bedroom was on one side of our house, the fridge on the other, so you see the predicament.  The man had no fucking shame at all.  It wasn't damaging or anything honestly, just kind of gross.  It's especially odd to be taught life lessons by your naked father.  

He would do it post sex with my mom a lot.  So usually friday evenings.  That's when they fucked.  That's also when I heard them fuck, and my friends heard them fuck, which my friends found hilarious.  It was brutally noisy, you could hear the FWOP FWOP FWOP of balls on ass, my mother moaning, and a vibrator going absolutely fucking bunny rabbits.

My parents are in their 60s, and they were in their 50s when this was going on, and neither of them have been able to hear good in many decades so I doubt this was on purpose.  

I found out the sex thing wasn't normal when my friends came over.  Apparently they never heard their parents fucking, and this was not only somewhat traumatizing for them, it was intriguing, and disgusting, and hilarious.  I had to pull them away from the fucking door a couple of times. 

Oh and one fateful morning, my dad actually walked out naked amidst all my friends.  He even stepped over them, as we were all sleeping.  He met my mother in the kitchen, stark naked.  She said to him ""Taaahh meee!  Puckbeaverton's friends are here, didn't you see them?""

Then I got to see my dad run naked, back to his room.

So yeah, that's when I realized that shit wasn't normal either.  I didn't think anything of it seeing him walk in, just naked dad, per usual. Then seeing his and mom's reaction kind of broke that down.

Probably the most disturbing part of this, was he was a logger, and an alcoholic.  So his body after a sweaty day at work had a very distinct aroma.  I always thought it was the booze.  20 years later I have found out that I smeell the same when I come home from work, so it's definitely not the booze.  

Now I get to smell my dad's ass as an adult, and it's attached to me.

As I surveyed the crowd, it dawned on me that they all looked like babies. Fresh, pink faces, no crows feet, not a single grey hair. Nobody was my age. Nobody. I was the oldest one in the bar, and that made me, by default, the creepy weird old guy. 

I did not hit on any women that night. Instead I went home and sulked for a while."

Changed my life. I was in a really bad rut with my girl friend when I started working. I was inside most of the day and when I wasn't it was dark out. I got almost no direct sun light. It was the middle of summer and I was experiencing winter depression. Once I started taking vitamin D, I went back to being myself again. If you don't get enough direct sunlight in your life, first and foremost, try to. But if you can't, take vitamin D. "

"&gt; I am not pretty, but I'd like to think I'm not the ugliest.

You are probably average in a pleasant way. In my experience, pleasantly average women fare better than really attractive or really ugly ones because **most people are pleasantly average as well**. 

In short, your looks are probably not your obstacle. 

&gt;Maybe twice a week someone will flirt with me

So wait, you get flirted with twice a week? You do realize thats better than average, right?

&gt;I just want to be asked out once. How can I make myself more approachable?

Well, you can always practice changing the mood you give out. Believe it or not, most men fear rejection even from pleasantly average women. If you are giving the impression that you don't want to be bothered, guess what? You aren't going to be bothered. Moreover, where are you looking for men at? You will have wildly different results based on:

1. Location
2. Man:woman ratio
3. Day of the week (in my experience, people who are sociable and pleasant tend not to be in bars at 2 am on Friday) 

Additionally, try casting a wider net. Go to places you normally dont frequent and you might start running into men that you wouldnt run into normally."

"Sorry for the length. 

Essential oils! Her, her sister, and her mom all swear by it, and that’s fine with me. The problem is when they started using them on my son. They were rubbing him down with all kinds of shit. I mean, a lot, they were treating him like his life depended on having this stuff. I did some independent research and found that in concentrated amount lavender and tea tree oil can block androgens in pre-pubic males. (I read this in published medical journals.) I decided that he didn’t need them and the risk associated with it was too great. 

So I go to my wife, explain that I found a lot of great information about aroma therapy, essential oils, and whatever stupid shit she would find agreeable. Then I explained that I also found something alarming about some of them and I didn’t want to use them on our son anymore. 

She started yelling, calling me names, and then finally stormed off. Well when she stormed off she started texting with her mom and sister. By the next day I had to provide all the information that I found and they still disagreed. (I shouldn’t have to defend the way I want to raise my kids, especially to the in laws, so it turned from a “hey let’s not do this anymore” to a “you aren’t a doctor, so stfu”) Eventually, after all these medical journals were called all sorts of names by these women I just got tired of repeating myself. I told them that a freelance journalist in webmd isn’t a viable source of information, and I don’t want my kids to have it, period, so get the fuck over it. 

I have tons of other stories about essential oils arguments if anyone is interested. One involves how my mother in law claims it keeps her cancer free. "

For guys below a certain threshold, that's in doubt with each new partner in a manner they can't fix. I feel for the guys who have anxiety over it.

Porn does sometimes make me feel like my dick is a little small, but then I remember that women - including my SO - have jumped through hoops to get another shot of that vitamin D and I can make my SO orgasm at least once most times out, so that thought passes quickly."

If suddenly I have blemishes, bags under my eyes, and I look bleak and the rest doesn't then that doesn't sound like a good thing. I'm not really sure how women not wearing make-up experience this, but I can imagine they get questions like ' are you sleeping well? ' a lot more often.

I wish I could say that I don't care, and fuck the effort, time or money that would go into using make-up, but I'm vain enough that I'd go along with the crowd with at least some minor make-up. "

"This sounds counter intuitive, but focus first on being relaxed. As in, get yourself to a state where it's perfectly fine even if you don't have sex. Stop caring about whether or not you'll get laid. Don't make it some make or break proving point for your ego. You're already fine. It's not important. Resign yourself to the fact that if it never happens for next ten thousand years, that's fine. If the girl isn't into you, guess what, there are at least three billion other ones. 

It's more important to be good company. It's a Jedi mind trick you play on yourself. The thing you want appears once you stop focusing on it so intensely. Focus on it too intently and you risk creeping people out, stressing yourself to no end, and forcing an uncomfortable situation that didn't have to happen. Sex is always optional. People don't want to share in something if the other person is white knuckling it with urgency. Even if you're being passive, they can sense if your vibe is tense or relaxed. They want the thing that is perfectly available and might be fun if they so decide to take it. 

Focus on being comfortable, playful and making a social connection. Sex should never be in the foreground. First, you have to be enjoying each-other's company. Sex is just one of many many different ways of enjoying somebody's company. Master the art of simply hanging out, really listening, learning how to open up. Never attach urgency to anything. Intimacy should grow out of a relaxed and enjoyable connection, or it shouldn't happen. Period. Also, the other person always has a right to change their mind. No matter what, no matter when. It's their body, they get to decide what to do with it. Once you've established an atmosphere of relaxed safety, rooted in your own comfort and confidence, everything else should follow naturally. "

By posting the details he effectively was outing the person to anyone who knew my account IRL to our mutual circle of friends.

I sent the redditor some angry PMs. Eventually he deleted his comments (and his related submitted posts on other subreddits) about the abuse event. I don't believe any damage was done to the victim. I was furious though. Anyone who works with kids should know better and I hope to hell he learned something from the exchange."

"Attraction for men is like a leaky gas stove. All it takes is one spark to have a major explosion. BOOOM!!!

For women, it's like building a fire with only 1 or 2 matches left. First you gotta find the right spot for the fire, (The woman you desire)  then find a bunch of dried up twigs and leaves and place them at the bottom then bigger pieces of wood and then some big logs that burn slowly but keep the whole thing going. Not to mention there's got to be plenty of oxygen.  The twigs are the little things that add up like showing up on time, not checking out the hot waitress and keeping your hands to yourself even though your date looks soo damn sexy in those yoga pants. You usually have one or 2 tries to get it right. If you strike a match too soon and hold on to it too long you get burned. If the twigs catch on but you don't keep building, feeding and gently fanning the fire it will die out and she will ""need some space"" or you'll hear that ""work is crazy right now "" 

And then there is what you're doing. You thought you saw a little flame so you decided you're going to help it by pouring lighter fluid on it. But telling her how you feel so soon  is not lighter fluid it's throwing the box of matches on top of that one little flame and and spraying the whole thing with a fire hose until nothing is left. You will never built THAT fire again.

"Sometimes it’s not a straight physical thing. 

Sometimes it’s actually really fun and intimate, you dance, joke around, really enjoy each other’s company. After going home and having sex, maybe passionately or playfully, you end up just hanging out, talking about stuff like best friends catching up, maybe having some wine on the balcony or in bed, you just really click, like you’re each other’s loves of your lives. But you know it’s temporary because perhaps you’re just travelling, or they are, and although you’ll occasionally think of them and remember fondly, it’ll one day just be a distant memory and you’re both just grateful for the time you did get together. 

On the other hand sometimes it’s just some rough girl you met at last call, yelling at you to fuck her ass harder, and once you’re done she asks you to leave her hotel room, and on your way out you hear her on the phone arguing with the boyfriend she never mentioned.

It's like you all want to be a part of something large and honorable, but no one can agree what the rules are so you just bicker and make them up and act as if they are part of a Towering Bastion of Man.

"First of all I’m sorry for your loss.

As for me, I just lost my dad 2 months ago due to a Suicide and I was the one who found him. It’s hard, even two months later but it’s getting a little better everyday.

What is helping me is to keep doing what I’m doing. I’m working hard to finish up my degree at college and I just had his funeral and memorial last week. Take a couple days to yourself, and do what you can to get back on track. The best thing I’ve found to do is try to make him proud of what I’m doing with my life and not sulk and throw a pity party for myself because he wouldn’t want to be remembered like that. 

I’m an only child, and my mom isn’t in the picture and it’s been tough. Talk to who you want when you’re ready and don’t let anyone tell you how to act or pressure you to make decisions.

Cry. Get it all out. I don’t cry, but about a week after it hit me and I bawled for hours and hours. Then I laughed, my dad was my best friend in the world and I started to think about every good and stupid memory I had of him. Terrible jokes, nights just hanging out and sipping some gin and whiskey and just talking. Football, racing, all of it. Then I laughed some more thinking about how I got 21 incredible years with an even better man who raised me to do great things and how I’m gonna honor it. 

It’s going to be hard talking about it, but try to remember the good memories and cherish you had them. Talk about those, don’t be afraid to smile and laugh, you should never feel guilty about laughing and smiling about a good memory when you tell people.

I told fun stories at his funeral. I made myself and everyone else smile, because he was a fun guy and that’s how he deserved to be remembered.

I hope some of this helps you but this is what I’ve done to help myself and I hope I can extend it to you. 

If you want a stranger to talk to and share some memories feel free to PM me whenever. My hearts out to you."
"Plus if your female and wear makeup on a regular basis people get used to you in makeup and get weirded out if you aren't wearing it. My little sister came down without her face on one day and my mom goes ""it's a good thing you wear makeup cause, ooof"" my little sister went back upstairs and put her face on.

I on the other hand (also female) never wear makeup and never have (maybe like 3 times my entire life, to weddings) and no one cares or pays attention to it. I save so much time and money and no one really cares.

My sister stopped wearing makeup for the most part, now it's maybe a little eye liner and some lip liner, and after a weeks people got totally use to it and let me tell you she is still gorgeous."

"I work at a university, so I guess it was when I started working there.  But one thing stands out.  We had a student worker who was 20, helping me inventory some equipment.  As we walked over to the building, they were giving out sandwiches to the parents and new freshman for orientation.  She told me that a sandwich sounded good and that she was hungry.

I told her ""you know, you could probably just pretend to be a freshman and go grab one and no one would notice.""

And then she said, ""Yeah, and you could probably get one too if you pretend to be my dad!""

"When mom jeans and high-waisted underwear became fashionable.

I don't think I'll ever be able to wrap my head around it, because when I was growing up they were disparaged and considered the most uncool thing possible that your parents, or worse, your grandparents (e.g. ""granny pants"") would wear.

And now I see girls in the age range 15-24 wearing them and it's just really weird to me. I don't find it at all attractive, but presumably, people younger than me do. Which makes me realise that the things I find attractive are heavily affected by culture. What people were wearing when you were growing up probably defines your likes and dislikes for the rest of your life."

When I was four my parents gave me a book called “Where did I come from”.  It was a picture book that basically did the whole sex talk thingy.  Mom and dad wanted me to be comfortable talking with them about sex and related topics from a young age.  It did lead to some pretty hilarious incidents though: one day I ran running into my parents’ room with my teddy bear (a few weeks after I got the book according to mom) and proclaimed “mommy mommy my bear has a vgiant!”  After a moment’s consideration and cursory examination she said “I suppose she does.”

"The “cool girls” in this sub, who really only play the game for validation and upvotes. So you love giving blowjobs, getting fucked in the ass, and don’t mind if your boyfriend cuddles with his best female friend and you want to know what guys think about a girl like you? Interesting

The lack of common sense and basic social skills among users in this sub. That’s why i always say /r/blackfellas is better. Most of the questions here wouldn’t be asked if people weren’t so entitled and used common sense. Which mentioning blackfellas leads time to another thought, but the black dudes in this sub are of the self hating variety who throw black people, namely black women, under the bus. So the black men in this sub are kind of disappointing, but they get their upvotes and brownie points so 🤷🏽‍♀️

This has got to be the most sympathy I have ever felt for an internet stranger. You are working hard to make yourself a better person but you can't seem to get the mental part of it right. You seem like a genuinely motivated and decent person. You just lack a few social skills and it is killing you from the inside. The best advice I can give you and know it doesn't make any sense is that you have to realize you aren't the only one struggling to make real friends in this world. Everyone you meet has some feeling of loss or lack of bond also. Using your own self pity and turning it into empathy towards others would go along way when you are with them. 
Send him this in a written letter.

I have higher expectations than most guys I know for the financial stability of my dates. . .for other guys it doesn't seem to matter but it's 2018 you know? I do NOT want to spend my life arguing with my wife about money. She needs to know how to earn it, handle it, budget it, save it, and spend it responsibly. If she doesn't know, I will teach her. But if she's not even willing to meet me halfway on the teaching part .. just forget it. That's not a partnership. "

Shit I get worked up all the time just thinking about some sexy time with the wife. I have fantasized about their being two of her but then I would need another of me because I wouldn't be able to handle all of that. It would also be weird watching me fuck my own wife. Especially if they left the room because when they came back I wouldn't know who the replica is and I would feel bad that I could be kinda cheating on her. Also what if I kept the replica. I mean that could come with a whole host of problems. I am also kind of an asshole so I wouldn't like hanging out with another me. I mean it would be alright at first but boundaries would be weird. I also might change over time. What if both of my wives liked other me. Then there would be two of my wife fucking one of me but I'm not getting any. That would be upsetting.
 It sounds like you two are dating in all but name

"Also, stop watching porn.

I know that sounds like weird advice, but I can speak to this from experience. I'm not anti porn, I think it's fine. But, if you've crossed the threshold into addiction, which can happen without you realizing it, it's time to take a break.

Porn is like anything else. Drinking a couple beers every week is fine. When you can't function without beer it's an issue. Watching a little porn is fine. When you stop seeing women as women and start seeing them as sex objects, it's an issue.

If you are struggling with getting out of that porn mindset, meeting people and spending time with them is a great start. But you'll also need to take a break from whatever it is that's causing the mindset issue in the first place.

Good luck friend!"

"I'm white and an American. Dated a girl from Korea.

Not so funny but she didn't want to meet my parents after several months of dating because in Korea you don't meet your SO's parents until before you're about to get married.

She needed me to text her all the time and say good morning and good night everyday. On my days off she asked me to let her know what I was doing, when I was doing it so she could feel like she spent the day with me. One sunday I didn't text her apart from good morning because I was going to see her at 6 that night. She was pretty hurt.

Not entirely sure if this next part was her or culture but she also expected me to provide almost everything for her, I didn't handle it well and would say things are expensive after spending a lot. She'd pay for things too but it was 80/20 me. Dropped $200 on theme park tickets but she'd also want to go out to breakfast in the morning and lunch afterwards. Couldn't man up and tell her I couldn't afford to do anything more. Would just comment that things are expensive, which would ruin dates. Eventually it led to her breaking up with me because I didn't offer to pay for her doctor bill at a quick care center when she had an allergic reaction. I was there to pick her up at 2 in the morning when she had the allergic reaction but it didn't matter because I didn't offer to pay for her shot and didn't take care of her that day. Bill was $300, I said it was expensive and we can get the shot at another quick care place. I managed to save her $200 but she thought it meant that I didn't want to spend any money to help her.  All in all she expected me to provide more than I thought. 

Our communication was messed up but my experience with her makes me think Korean girls are very old-fashioned.

These comments are fire!
the fact that my grandmother is as old as many of my friends mothers. rest of the family follows suit.
"Me and my best friend of 20 years we're talking and I asked him why he has never tryed to set me up with his wife's friends. He said, ""My wife thinks you're  amazing and if she likes you we can always hanging out. Her friends are sweet and caring people and I know you're very selfish in relationships. If you hurt one of her friends, it would not be good for us."" 

'Your selfish in relationships' hit me like a ton of bricks coming from someone I have known for so long. I always I thought I was pretty masculine, but now I think I need to look at it a little differently.

I could also be completely wrong. This has just been on my mind for some time now."

"I wanted a full blown relationship. She essentially wanted a roommate. We'd been together a year or so, I'd moved in, and her daughter had already started called me dad (on her own).
