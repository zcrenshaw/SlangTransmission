"&gt; Prez's response: we updated the org chart, you have zero excuses. Sign this paper acknowledging that you acted inappropriately and there will be no other repercussions, though I would prefer if you also apologized to OM in person.

wtf?!"
You should argue that their updating the org chart without notifying anyone of the changes is really bad synergy and negatively affects your core values.
"Management here lives in another universe where our actual daily work isn't as important as 'core values', 'customer facedness' and 'synergy'. 

And most of upper management spends a good chunk of their time creating mission statements and 'way forward points', which all boil down basically to a bunch of Hallmark Card emotional appeals which don't actually address our industry. 

The president just inherited the company from his deceased father last year, and while his dad was a good businessman forged in the actual pits, his son is a pampered elitist that thinks everyone without a business degree is incompetent. 

And all he knows to do is make pithy but ultimately meaningless statements. 

Morale and retention have tanked the last 8 months, this is just one of the symptoms of massive mismanagement. "

"Funny.

Her fear is based on some small amount of fact.  Older clutches use tight-fiber asbestos on their plates.  This is not a hazard in manufacturing, but it is a hazard for mechanics.   https://www.osha.gov/dts/shib/shib072606.pdf .   It is not considered a hazard for anyone except when replacing the parts.  [Info also https://www.epa.gov/asbestos/current-best-practices-preventing-asbestos-exposure-among-brake-and-clutch-repair-workers-1 and  https://www.asbestos.net/asbestos/products/clutches/  (biased) ]

Also, it's worth noting that asbestos was also used in some automatic transmissions and some brake pads.  While you can still by replacement parts with asbestos, the use of asbestos parts in new cars was prohibited in 1999 (at least in the UK).  Not sure about the US.

"&gt; the tech was unable to keep the ticket closed

From what I'm reading it sounds like when the user replies to the email closing the ticket, the system reopens the ticket.

So.. they're trying to blame the tech for reopening the ticket when the system is the one that auto reopens it?

At least the bobs in office space eventually found a problem(TPS reports being done by the wrong department) 

These guys seemed to fixate on something you cant help."
Yep you are tech support.  Your story belongs here.
"I got a tenant that did the same thing. He owned a company that supplied furniture for other business. He started to lose business due to some reason or two, so he and a few associates went to work for others and got them to buy their stock by the same method as Jake. Then they would quit and go to work for someone else. Once they killed their stock, they declared bankruptcy. 

My tenant and his associates found themselves unofficially blacklisted from multiple industries across the West coast. They had to either move or work fast food to make ends meet. My tenant is now in the East coast and when he tried to start a new business again, he found that his history is causing him problems here. He's a security guard for a hospital now. "

"Unfortunately, this business seems to operate by a very peculiar set of rules not based on any reality I'm aware of. 

We spend over $8k a month on presentations that are basically the same sixteen words in different fonts and with 'edgy' transitions. 

Yet they won't give us a hardware replacement or hotswap budget for their critical server infrastructure. 

We are literally 2 failed drives away in a stack of 40 from absolute data loss. 

And we could literally crash proof that entire pile of big iron for about two weeks of their presentation budget. 

But NoooOOOoo, renting meeting halls and 4 star catering is more important than business critical data...

The place is a right shitshow, I am not even slightly exaggerating. "
"&lt;bob&gt;No, you don't understand. It's not the tech reopening the ticket, it's the tech failing to keep the ticket closed.&lt;/bob&gt;"
"Back when Sarbanes-Oxley was first getting started, we had a pretty good auditor that worked with us for the first 3 years. One of those rare ones that not only understood security and auditing, but also IT and the challenges you faced.  All good things must come to the end, and he was promoted out of the field, and was replaced with a ""Checklist Charlie"". Charlie had no understanding of anything technical, but was trained to go down his checklist and verify each and every item. 

At the time, we had an on-site data center... I think it was the last one that I ever designed. As one of it's fire prevention controls, it had a big red switch to shut off all electrical power to the room. The switch was behind a plastic cover with a big sign above it, ""DO NOT PUSH"".

Charlie wanted to see the data center. I don't really know why, and I don't think it was on his checklist, either. Hindsight. At the time, I just wanted him gone. We walked in, gave a short tour, and he asked about the shut-off switch. I explained fire prevention, dry pipes, no longer able to use Halon, etc. Turned away for a moment, a fucking moment, and suddenly you hear about 50 fans plus the AC powering down. He had hit the switch.

I muscled him out of there, he kept repeating, ""I just wanted to test it"", and I physically threw him out of the office. Called his boss and threatened death from above, anthrax in his coffee, teams of lawyers, etc., if he *ever* sent an idiot like that to us again. Meanwhile, my staff was starting the process of bringing all of our systems back up, doing checks, etc. Took us 4 days and nights to return to normal. 

Our CFO started legal action against the auditing company, and I had to give a deposition. It was eventually settled out of court.

The next auditor that came in had a very bad time with us. He complained that we never let him out of our sight. He wasn't wrong."
"I dunno, I heard (second-hand) of a young scientist who started crying in class after learning about for loops at a Software Carpentry workshop (basically “bash and python for dummies”).

"You underestimate the entitlement of our Upper Management department. That said, the meeting is in 10 mins, I'll come back and update after (if I'm not escorted out the building...). "
"It's a right to work state, one of the guys they fired last month was for 'Sloppy appearance'. 

The dude was a normal dresser, clean and  office casual. 

The real reason they fired him was because of those informative unionization pamphlets he was distributing. 

He's planning on suing, because being dismissed for unionizing is illegal. 

But they also have apparently many 'notes' in his file for 'sloppy appearance', dating back a year or three. 

He's never been given a warning, no one ever spoke to him. 

Which makes me think that fucking management does this for every employee in case their is a need for a quick fire. 

(sent from my meeting, because fuck them)"
This guy synergies.
"My favorite audit asked for me to output all test results to output.txt.

Then, at the end, the asked me to provide the file results.txt.

I asked my boss if it was a trick question.  We provided output.txt and made a note that there was no results.txt and we assumed they asked for the wrong file."

When I was military there was a reserve officer who was caught paying himself rent (reservists on active orders get reimbursed for the rent they pay if having to relocate to the duty station) for a sailboat that he owned. He essentially charged himself $1000 a month to live on his own boat in San Diego. USMC paid it without question. 
No no. He wanted you to rename the file before giving it to him. It has to be called output while the job is still running. If it’s called results the computer might get confused and then stop the job too early thinking the results are ready. 
"&gt; He has yet to replace the bad capacitor.

My former Brother-in-Law used to run a business servicing a particular type of light engineering machine. These machines really needed routine cleaning and maintenance. The user could do the cleaning themselves but routine maintenance needed a trained engineer (e.g. my BIL).

He offered all his customers maintenance contracts to help spread out the work load. But no-one ever took him up on it. Costs too much. Can't have production stopped for the hour it would take. So he would routinely get emergency calls from across the country because the machines were broke.

Now, he needed specific tools and parts so he had to drive. Which would mean the customers machine would be 'broke' for 24 hours or more. Because they 'couldn't afford' an hour of downtime once a month.

And of course the machines were never cleaned.

That sounds like the case. My dad used to work the same job and did the exact same test and the two security engineers at the place he did the test tried the same thing. Luckily like OP my father marked his drives for easy recovery later. The laughter and smile on his face when he got home that week was priceless.
"From the sounds of it, he is just trying to look good and show how he improved productivity by banning games. However, I could totally see someone moving up and after a while realizing how much time they spent playing games, and deciding something should be done.

"I think science actually has a need for both types - everyone thinks about the (lazy)/inquisitive type who are more likely to develop new theories, but you also need the sort of scientist who can run the same experiments (possibly with small variations) to produce the quality data sets the first type needs.

For example, the material scientists who produced three-element phase diagrams - it might not have the glamour of nickel-titanium superalloys, but without them we wouldn't have the fabulous diversity of metalurgy available today"

"I was in the office when a major earthquake (7.1) hit the city. Fortunately, the office was largely undamaged, but the damage it caused and the subsequent flood of traffic took down both cellular and PSTN networks across the city; if not the region.  
I picked up the fresh offsite backup, packed up the rest of my gear, and went home.

As you would expect, there were the usual announcements - ""state of emergency"", ""do not travel unless absolutely necessary"", etc.

So the next day, I remotely connected to the office server and carried working as if I was at the office. After a couple of hours, a manager rings me. ""Are you coming in today?""

""Nope,"" says I. ""State of emergency and all that.""

""Well I think you should.""

""Has the building been inspected and found to be free from damage as per the Earthquake Recovery Authority's advice prior to re-entering a building?""

""Uh, well... No.""

""Then why are YOU in there?""

""Uh, well, the neighbours are here...""

The neighbours at the time were a group of commercial real estate agents, who (in my limited opinion of having almost nothing to do with them) would happily sell their grandmother's vital organs out from under her, if it meant closing a deal.

""And if the neighbours jumped off a bridge? I'm not coming in. I'm still working, but I'm just not in the office.""

To prove my point, at that point, I printed a hard copy of some paperwork on the office printer.

""...Speaking of which, can you file the letter that just rolled off the printer for me? Folder #12345. Cheers.""

The building was eventually cleared, and I returned to working in the office."
"Better yet, 'empower' her to send the logs. Make sure the directions are time consuming, along with her notes on the dropout times and durations. "
"That's unfortunately too common. They're just telling you to provide them the access to a folder with a very specific and uncommon name and they just expect you to know exactly what folder they're talking about.

To be fair, in this case, user is just providing what he's seeing on his manager's computer. Most users aren't aware of what an UNC path is and, even if you explain it to them two or three times, they're likely to always do that.

And then, when there is an audit, they're the first ones to complain about the amount of users who have access to that or this folder. Funny."

"Pretty much the same in the US. Working on older cars/trucks always gives me a slight spike in anxiety. Working on 30 year old brake drums full of possible asbestos dust is a real treat. You would hope that someone would have switched out the shoes by now but I wouldnt be surprised if some customer's cars haven't had the rear brakes attended to since Reagan was president. 

Gotta hose it down with brake cleaner so that dust doesn't get airborne. They used to make a vacuum bag that would go over the tire and drum to try and evacuate the dust. 

I guess Australia is very uptight about asbestos and people have a very difficult time importing old cars that may have even tiny amounts of asbestos."
