Of course you need a hammer in your toolbox. You **build** a PC
"Man, I might just go with ""alt-F4"" on mine."

Hello, computer.

Keyboard? How quaint"
You sound like a great boss. I appreciate your attitude toward your workers.

"Thank you!  I have been lucky to have been able to hire a number of amazing people over the years.  I still keep in touch with many of them.

Rules to live by for bosses off the top of my head:

1) Treat people as people.

2) Delegate responsibility, authority, and credit at the same time.

3) When they show aptitude, trust them with new challenges even if they don't have the self-confidence to tackle them yet.  That'll build self-confidence.

4) Generally, don't let them make their problems be your problems (some exceptions exist)

5) Get rid of poisonous people, even if they're rockstars/working on critical projects/whatever.

6) Advocate for your team.

7) Expect growth, but not perfection.

Really it all comes down to #1.  The minute employees are numbers instead of people, you've lost."
"Hey, perhaps you get to be paid twice as well."
"Even when the printer is nonexistent, it is *still* the bane of I.T.

Edit: Aww, thank you :D"
"That reminds me of a specific, and will remain nameless, point of sale company I used to work for.

There was a dramatic increase in a specific virus that was hitting multiple locations.
Turns out, someone had plugged in an infected USB stick into the imaging machine, so every terminal that was sent out (new or repaired) would show up with a virus and infect everything else on the network.

Those were fun times..."
That's why I used a hot glue gun on mine. Holds it all together.
"&gt; Surprised no one knows who or why the switch got unplugged.

Somebody knows. Nobody wants to own up to it."
"An Ex of mine used to work for a clothing/accessories company doing frontend dev. I'm not a dev, but I'm particularly decent at looking at broken code and understanding why it might not work.

After hours of watching her try (and fail) to fix a particular page having to do with adding Bags (purses) to the shopping cart, I offered to take a look. I see that (pardon my fucking-up of proper syntax here, like I said - I'm not a dev) there's two variables called ""bags_in""/""bags_out"". I don't remember the specifics, but somehow they were repeated in the code - maybe called twice and killing each other somehow.

So I tell her, ""I'm going to try something, I think the issue is with this particular variable being reused. I'm going to rename it, I think this'll solve the issue"".

Of course, I rename it ""Bilbo_Bags_in"".

She pushes it, it fixes the problem, she's thrilled, and she forgets about it.

Apparently it'd been a problem for weeks, and when her boss went over the code to see what had been changed, she got a pat on the back for ""creative variable naming""."
"Ya, but you actually recognize and understand the line between Wednesday and Thursday. 

My client legitimately thinks ""Wednesday"" is from 9am Wednesday to 9am Thursday. And when ever we correct her, or try to teach her, she freaks out and says stuff like ""I dont have time to learn *your* fancy IT time table"". "
"Close that ticket with a solution of ""PEBKAC*""

*Typically stands for problem exists between keyboard and chair. Modified in this case to problem exists between keyboard and clipboard. "
Why would you ever try to brute-force electronics like that? Some people should just take a time-out.
I'm sorry for your loss.
"Alt F4 has this online gaming community vibe for me. Like gone too soon.
So im maybe overly careful but i would like to ask you if you are ok? :-)"
"Haha, why didn't I think of that before :\-)!"
"Screw everyone else, amirite "
"Way back when, we had a collection of sounds you could play over our network of Irix workstations.  The office prank war winner wrote an evil script.  If you were working after 9 pm it would play the sound of a cough or sniffles *on a workstation near you*. "
"In a similar vein...

My dad worked in IT, and had a heart attack a few years ago, and they needed to use the paddles to revive him. One of the first things I asked mum, and then later him “Have you tried turning him off and on again?”

Mum wasn’t amused - but dad was!"
"&gt; my manager expected me to complete in my own time

Hahahaha no."
As someone who works overnight shift i do this sort of thing accidentally all the time. Since i work through the night it might be halfway through thursday before i realize its not wednesday anymore &gt;.&lt;
"&gt; Turns out, someone had plugged in an infected USB stick into the imaging machine

Fuckin' lol."
"When I worked at my uni help desk, I heard stories of fathers moving their kids into the dorms who used hammers to install Ethernet cords into phone jacks. On the same wall plate as the Ethernet jacks. "
"Reminds of a story I heard a few years back.

Some security company was contracted to build a secure office/storage area for a particular army base.  

After it was built, the brass and others base personnel were inspecting the new setup and listening to the company crowing about their new fangdangled security lockup hardware.

Finally, one of the sergeants said he could get into this area fairly quickly.  The company reps told him to go for it.  The sergeant then kicks a hole through the drywall next to the door and is into the secure area in under a minute."
"Well, it was over 9000 as well. /J"

"Story the other day of a locksmith arriving to unlock a car with keys inside. Opened car, told person it would be X dollars (reasonable price). Person balked, said it was too much, ""or that he should just be nice and let it be free.""

Locksmith said fine, lock the car again with keys still inside, started to pack up. Person complained they still needed the keys. Locksmith said he could still get them but price would now be 2X because he will have unlocked the car twice. Person grumbled but agreed to pay 2X."

"Of course, anyone with knowledge of the modern classics (Mr Jinks) knows the plural of ""mouse"" is ""meeces"" ;)"
That seems like an abuse of company resources.
Sounds like we found OP's new flair.
"This is seriously great!

Now I want “CONNECTION RESET BY PEER” on my tombstone."
"&gt;Surprise no one knows who or why the switch got unplugged.

It's a coin flip between a space heater and a phone charger."
"Hah.  After a number of years in management, I'm back to programming and I couldn't be happier (for now).

The people I hired were great.  But I got damn tired of the execs.  And the reports.  Soooo many reports and spreadsheets.  Now I hear my boss talk about reports, reorgs, and I can just lean back, open emacs, and smile."
"&gt; if it ain't broke, don't fix it

Hate to be that guy, but nope. This is why you do stuff the right way when setting things up. Because if it ain't broke, it probably still is. You want to know that your system is going to work fine if one NIC loses its connection for some reason and that you can take care of it in peace without anyone noticing? Or do you want to try get a downed AD/Proxy back up, while absolutely everyone is going to try chewing your ass because they can't log on?"

"My RAM is in the cloud, so it can be randomly accessed from anywhere. "
There was a train in my wife's city that departed at 00:30 everyday. You can imagine how many people went in with a ticket for the day's before train everyday...
"Haha I totally didn't consider that, and I'm doing well thank you! I appreciate the concern! 

What's silliest about it is that you most often trick other people into hitting altf4 in gaming communities and I have no idea how that metaphor would translate. 

Hmmm... best not to think about."
Have they ever booked a travel ticket - a late night plane ticket. Would be interesting to see what they do then
Congratulations. Your solution is *worse* than Access.
