"Yeah, he's not getting that data back. Ever. "
This person apparently sees IT people as subhuman. There's a very real problem with them.
This story seems familiar....
"""My off hour support rates start at $100 per half hour block. Minimum rate is one block per call, it rounds up. You need to pre-pay for 10 blocks before you get my number. I can get you a copy of the contract."""
So what I'm hearing is you won't need to patch it because it'll never happen again.
"Yeah, the odds of getting data off those platters are *barely* better than the odds of getting a straight answer from a brain that's been removed from somebody's head..."
"As an aside, as of May 25th this year, the release of Windows XP is closer to the release of Windows 1.0 than the present day."
They probably have a better chance recovering data from the [hard drive that was sanded](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/22mar1/can_you_repair_my_repair/)
"Sir, I am not a box opening person, even when it is addressed to me!"
I would be documenting this as much as possible. You're about to become SF's sacrificial lamb when this blows up.
Please update us and let us know how this was recieved!
"So they actually knew that they had to dial the phone and didn't make you do it for them??  
Wow. I'm impressed"
"Considering my past experience with the software manufacturer they'll promise it to be fixed in the upcoming releases. Then years roll by and suddenly, when you completely forgot about it already, it appears in the ""fixed issues"" section of the changelog."
&gt; - Fixed dead customer bug
"But the backups of the desktops shouldn't matter, because everyone saves all of their important files to the network, and....*snicker*....damn, I almost made it all the way through."
"I've been on a couple of those calls.  

Evidence produced, guilty party present, everyone else asked to leave


*But, I wanna hear this....  Please??*
"
"Jeff The Sleazy Sales Guy just walked.

SF came over and started howling at me and I held up my hand and said ""Stop.  I'm out of here for the day"" and left."
The last one was a fridge magnet
"Seriously. Even when $Manager spelled out for her that she was demanding his employee risk his life to save her backups when she herself was not willing to remain, she kept on screaming. 

The few times I've encountered crazies like this, they've usually backed down when it's made clear to them that they are asking a tech to risk their life just to make up for their own lack of planning. $CCL does not sound like a client worth having."
"A missed opportunity, man. Hindsight really is 20/20...."
"Interesting. I have this problem with a box we use for monitoring. I have a program that wiggles the mouse every few mins to keep it from locking.

I'll try this instead lol"
"&gt;Issue: customer dying leads to erroneous calculation.  
&gt;Suggested fix: dead customers are brought back to life."
"Ugh. This reminds me of Fuelman, which is a company that transportation fleets use for fuel cards for their drivers. Their miserable web app STILL uses Java 6 and refuses to load if you try to use a newer version, and even then it acts funky in newer browsers even with the old school Java. 

I've had to virtualize XP SP3 with IE8 and Java 6 just to make it usable. If your product requires an entire virtualized PC to be operational, you need to recode your product."
"It wouldn't matter, Short Fuse is the owner. He's leapt from the mental gymnastics required to believe he alone is indespensible to *actual* gymnastics and is currently bending over backwards to fuck himself."

"More news as it trickles.  1 of our techs guys agreed to work over the holiday.  He's fairly new, young, and anxious to please.  He emailed BG, who basically said he's out of reach all 3 days.  
More back story:  BG was promised 4 weeks vacation when hired, and has been able to take about 3 days.  He mentioned to me several times his wife is unhappy about this.  Based on the PMs I've been getting asking for his contact info, I don't think he'll have any problem getting a job.  Heck, I've seen acquisitions done solely to *get* a team like the one that walked out the door.
I'm talking to a friend who is a lawyer."
Will do!
"&gt; I have a program that wiggles the mouse every few mins..

Aaaaand I know what I am installing on my friend's PC now."
"1) what the fuck

2) I'm pretty sure you guys ended up with my old 65-inch projection tv lol"
"My texts:
SF at least 8 texts ""CALL ME I'M FREAKING OUT""

JD ""BG has 2 offers and I'm talking to them Tuesday!""

Turning off phone.  Going Home."
"When his grades do appear, I'm not sure they'll be very good grades..."
"Anyone have a link to it? I haven't done much digging in TFTS yet, just see some things here and there. I'm curious to read the fridge magnet now. XD"
"If she has access to internet, yes, of course. Since we're a Citrix shop she'd even have access to all of her stuff then anyway! She could've just placed the files on the loaner herself before leaving, too. But considering the person in question I guess she didn't know how to do that, forgot to ask us, panicked and came up with the USB stick workaround... without thinking it through **at all.**"
"&gt; Admin: ""Of course, every day this week I've used a new floppy disk!""

I was legit expecting to find out they were changing the disk, then looking for the files."
"She already easily can access them via Citrix. See the several replies on this topic I've written in this thread. (In fact she has logged into Citrix meanwhile, as mentioned in another comment, so chances are good she got to her files by herself in time.)"
"Brenda The Office Mom finally noticed all the stress in the office and asked me what's wrong.  I bummed a cigarette and told her.

"The risk to life means nothing to a mid-level sociopath.

Tell her the cost in $$ for an on-site visit during a Cat5 Hurricane. That will shut her up"

Enjoy:)"
"Leave now OP, the company is dead. Is the compensation you'll get from them worth the stress of working under SF until it dies for real?

Let SF know how much he's messed up. Don't yell. Explain patiently, like you would to a small child, how his behavior has killed the company. How his incompetence has stolen its future away. Burn the bridge, don't look back.

Build a fire over the holiday. A big, controlled, bonfire. Burn something with the company logo on it. Enjoy the time off.

Apply somewhere new. Connect with BG and JD and SysAdmin, see where they're going. Best of luck to all of you."
"Put down a tape recorder. Step away from chair to get coffee.

Everyone is happy! (Except the bum you stole that antique tape recorder from, but hey, who the fuck has one of those nowadays...)"
Couldn't she just... Access the send ticket with the files from the loaner...?
Chances are she'll try again. Or other people will inevitably ask. Figure out what is worth your time and change rates depending on how big a jerk they are. Not a bad way to make some extra cash if you don't mind doing support work.
"Thank you for linking this, amazing post. "
"We all have our little moments, just don't let it fully consume you.

Never go full user."
"New Tech Kid, the one who agreed to work over the 3 day weekend, just asked me to look at the main Drupal box.  Apparently it's slooow and clients are complaining.  The updated datasets are supposed to be loaded today, which is his job, but the server is hanging.  He's gonna reboot and hope the failover is synced.  Hope everything is backed up!"
"Vestment doesn't matter. The company's dead. Get out of there. 

No competent dev is going to step foot on that landmine. Even without BG venting about you guys to other competent people, ""we lost our senior and junior dev for insubordination"" is an absolutely gigantic, incomprehensibly large, red flag. All it says is ""Run. Run, and never look back"" to anyone who interviews. Anyone foolish enough to accept the position isn't capable of digging the company out of that hole. 

And I say that as a dev doing basically the exact work it sounds like BG does. "
"Her mistake was not making a backup.

And by backup I mean a photocopy which is then immediately put into a shredder for extra security."
"if you dropped it off at [edited], there's a chance I sold the fresnel lens to a cool teen who wanted to melt things for youtube. "
"...and the Drupal box isn't connecting to the AWS RDS, so big box is down.  New Kid is bringing up backup box, but it doesn't have latest data."
"Thanks! You guys are right, this is definitely not an uncommon story. XD
Makes me scared to think of how people think computers work nowadays if they didn't even know how floppies worked. :("
"I just checked, I'm 25% vested, so if I leave I'll have something.  It occurred to me I could team up with BG and his tech buddies and spin up another version of what this company does.  I don't have an NDA nor a non-compete, don't know about BG."
sadly... this means we are out too...
Hell She's worried about backups. I wonder if her business is street level because if it is then backups is the least of her problems.
"Now the real question is whether they know how to put it on speaker or if they'll just leave it off the hook and shout at it.

Maybe we'll see a part 2 soon!"
"I briefly took a gig at an MSP, and a few days after I started, after I came back from lunch, I noticed that my mouse was wobbling.  I chalked it up to a shitty, worn desk and the optical sensor seeing the wear as motion.  So I moved the mouse to a different part of the desk.  Then it happened again.  So I rebooted.  Then it happened again.

So I reached around and found a phantom keystroke module plugged in to one of the USB ports.  I listened for the giggling and chucked it at the guy in the next cube.

Personally, I would've put it in the case and added a random beep as a clue."
By the time it reaches Florida it might be a cat6 or at least a cat5e. 
"
&gt;Also SF has put his wife on a retainer as a BD consultant.

Congratulations SF. If she isn't doing work worth her market value, they may be committing tax fraud.

Also, since it's screwing with effective executive compensation a bit, there may be governance issues as well, especially if the other shareholders are not aware of it."
"I wonder if she knew exactly what she was doing and just wanted to get away from everyone else in the clinic for a while. Otherwise, this is some grade A ouch."
"I wouldn't be surprised if the only copies of their files were on the desktops or some Jerry-rigged NAS that sits next to the server and the only thing backed up to their servers were shortcuts **FOR** said desktops or NAS.

No one can be that stupid, right...?

RIGHT!? Please tell me theres a 0% chance that its possible."
"Ticket Priority 1:

""Something is wrong with your grading site, everything is showing up as F."""
"""...Previously available option for alive customer to die is now removed"""
"SF just killed the business. It's in your best interest to find new work post haste. Good luck to you man, you're going to need it. "
Why not also upload them somewhere she could download them from? That way you can make her look silly and still be helpful in the end.
You guys don't use quantum entangled USBs? How 21st century.
"I work for a growing small company.  They got someone like ShortFuse in as an 'expert'.

He started out OK by renegotiating some contracts that had landmines in them we hadn't noticed.  Then he started on the employees...

1. Froze hiring, claiming that people just needed to work harder
2. Told all.the Devs to be in at 9am and issued reprimands when they were a minute late.  The net result was they all started leaving at 5pm sharp and taking the full hour for lunch so the number of hours worked tanked.
3. Changed the senior salesman's contract which he deemed too generous.  Causing him to quit.  Sales took a nosedive.. 

3 weeks after starting, our ShortFuse was booted out by the company owner.  If it had been much longer I suspect we'd have lost too many employees to survive.
"
I priced it at $10 and covered it with cardboard before letting him leave the store with it in the middle of a summer day. :v
"&gt; So they are always on soaker.

Please, do **not** correct this. I laughed so hard. It's beautiful."
"He was determined to show you how important he was.

And he succeeded! "
