"Yea, admit it guys. We‚Äôve all done the ‚Äúpretend like you‚Äôre in front of the computer while trying to get the manufacturer to just replace the damn failed part already‚Äù bit.

"Just reply with ""sure, we can do that"" and get the job done. A you've technically been asked here is employ mass email without calling it ""mass email"".

Find a new name for it, like ""broadcast messaging system"" and happily check all requirements on the spec, including the bullet ""not mass email"" üòÅ"
I bet she had a certificate of proficiency in computering as well
"Wasn't me but I heard a recording of a call once fora guy who threatened to shoot his modem if they wouldn't send him a new one, and when the tech refused (because there was nothing wrong with it, the customer just thought he could get a newer model of modem) so he shot it while on the phone with the tech, screamed himself hoarse when he was told he would be charged for its replacement. Then they had the followup call where he was equally ballistic after getting his replacement modem because it was the exact same model of modem, despite them telling him multiple times it was the only model of modem we used."
"&gt; Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what happened a few days ago. Mozilla and Fox Entertainment did a ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù (read: promotion) for the TV show Mr. Robot. It involved sideloading a sketchy browser extension which will invert text that matches a list of Mr. Robot-related keywords like ‚Äúfsociety‚Äù, ‚Äúrobot‚Äù, ‚Äúundo‚Äù, and ‚Äúfuck‚Äù, and does a number of other things like adding an HTTP header to certain sites you visit.

I was wondering why you mentioned Mr. Robot. That's really sketchy and unprofessional of Firefox. I'm glad that I switched to Chrome a few years ago."
"You're joking?...

So if I understand this right, the first most FF users would know is *random words they read would appear upside down*? And it's all a bloody advertisement?

Jesus fucking Christ, Mozilla, that's so horribly toxic"
"""Yep, I'm turning the router off. Now I'm plugging it back in. Yep, the DSL light is still flashing indicating the line has no connection.""

&gt;as if I didn't do that three times before calling"
"smh. Phone call should have ended when he took the condescending tone

&gt; I make way more in an hour than you ever will!

Take down his name, the time of his phone call, and a possible recording of the conversation. Report it to your supervisor."
"Firefox installed an extension (without permission) called LookingGlass via the experiments feature, which could re-enable itself if you turn it off. The extension injects Javascript code, DOM elements and CSS effects into every tab. This has the effect of inverting words that are relevant to the TV show ""Mr. Robot."" In other words, this is adware sanctioned by the web browser."
User error:  Replace user and retry
"Stylistic note - if you begin your lines with &gt; instead of four spaces, you'll get a quote format

&gt; Like this

The code format looks snazzy for Tech Support Tales, but it doesn't auto-wrap like other text, which makes it really hard to read on mobile since you have to keep scrolling to the end of the line, then scrolling back to the beginning."

"I had the same with a ""dy"" laptop once‚Ä¶"
"Know something thats like mailchimps but isnt mailchimps? I ruined mailchimps early on (""Hey I know this great mass email service called mailchimps""...fml)"
"&gt;  The extension injects Javascript code, DOM elements and CSS effects into every tab

Yep, fuck Mozilla forever in that case. I am dumbfounded that anyone thought this was a good idea. Way to completely undo the last 20 years of building trust in an instant over a fucking tv show."
"Hope you enabled shadow copies on that laptop.

If you were looking to make some easy money from this customer you could do a xenapp/rds of her quickbooks and she just logs in and runs it that way, you manage the infrastructure and backups and they never have to worry about losing their QB data which at this point is inevitable on a laptop."
"You're going to have to take my word that is is in a pretty tech-support related scenario, any more details and I will regret getting some people I know on this sub"
Rename the icon mailorangutan or something? &gt;_&gt;
"I had a student who was having trouble logging in, and when I watched him he was using capslock to handle the uppercase characters.  He had a good excuse, though -- not only was English not his first language, the Roman alphabet was not his first character set.  Once I showed him how to use the shift key he didn't have any more trouble.  Logging in, anyway..."
"It would be a bit of a pain, and require some specialized driver software for a use-case that is extremely niche, but you could do it and it'd be kinda cool. I almost want one now."
This sounds like ~~slavery~~ *mass email* with extra steps...

"I can confirm that many academics are resistant to reading anything. It's almost as though they've done all their reading to get their degrees and whatnot, and decline to read more. I've certainly overheard many  students moaning about how much they have to read.

On the other hand, it may just be that they do enough reading *in their chosen field* that anything outside of it is considered irrelevant to them.

In any case, phooey."
"100% acurate. I've also heard her talking about ""The Facebook"""

"Recently, NIST released new password guidelines that essentially all security professionals support. [this link](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/18/nists-new-password-rules-what-you-need-to-know/) has a decent summary.

In short:

* Don't have periodic password requirements
* Don't require special characters
* Do require at least 8 characters
* Do check against 'known common passwords' 

The first point is to allow people to actually pick a strong password. You should only invalidate passwords when there is reason to. This is even more important when your minimum length is higher. 
The second point is the real kicker here. This is much better than the old requirement of special characters. Instead you want to actually take care of the unsafe passwords.

The overal idea is that actual good password hygiene comes from users themselves, and you want to be in the way of that as little as possible. If you really can't trust someone not to choose password as their password, very little is going to make them safe. Instead we want to make it as easy as possible to do the right thing and get a decent password.

Personally, I'd suggest also upping the minimum to say 12 characters and encourage [diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) passwords.

"Oh that feeling of entering a server room and being hit by a blast of hot air!

We have a similar setup here, and over the last 20+ years, the AC unit died a few times. We once bought a portable AC unit to cool the room down when the install AC croacked in the middle of a heat wave, and an AC replacement was nearly impossible to come by. As the building has to be locked down over night and weekend, which meant that internal doors had to be properly locked, too, we had to  vent the heat into the storage depot in the basement..."
"Yeah, sadly he was an external customer so no chance to do that. At my company I‚Äôm considered the final level of support, you‚Äôre not getting a supervisor or manager on the line, period. That‚Äôs why I ended up having to draw a hard line of: do these steps or do it yourself."
Especially after quantum coming out and winning people back over from chrome. What a mess.

"I know a physician in a social setting - our kids are in the same after-school activity - and one day he asked me a computer-related question, ""do you have any idea why my A doesn't B?""  I asked if his A was like ""this"", or like ""that"";  he said ""pfffft, I don't know, I have people to worry about that stuff for me.""  I said ""pfffft, well then, I guess you'll just have to ask your people."""
