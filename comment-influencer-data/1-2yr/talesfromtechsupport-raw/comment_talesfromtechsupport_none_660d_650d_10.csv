"hahah some users. but yeah, at least shes honest."
"It's amazing how many users figure IT staff are blind, dumb and stupid when they pull shit like this..."
first time I'd ever been able to hear someone turn red over the phone  ;) 
"Yep.

I think she thought I'd just throw it away (because after all that's what she'd do if a computer broke) and replace it with another one from my mythical infinite stock of computers-that-are-faster-than-hers-was."
"EU followed proper procedure for hardware request.  
EU then asked a relevant question in a polite manner on how to use said equipment.  
EU then thanked you for your time.  

Yeah, keep that one."
"Ah yes, the old ""computers work better when they are turned on""."
"""This game is kind of fun on this huge screen, but the in-app purchases get pretty expensive..."""
"Nope; crushed to death under a pile of CRT monitors stacked precariously high to maximise floor space in a tiny store room.

Tragic really."
"Sad to hear she passed away friend. My condolences.
She sounds like the best sort of people, open to new things, eager to learn all the while staying critical.
"
"Wait, she said she was sorry?

Thatâ€™s a rare gem of a user, there."
"&gt; mythical infinite stock 

Yeap users think this exists. I was once told I had a pile of 22"" CRTs locked away in 10' x  16' store room. I invited the manager to have a look."
"Of all the posts on Reddit I've read, this is the one that has made me create an account.

This post cannot be taken seriously enough. I know. 

Two years ago just a few Sundays before thanksgiving, I got an email from my mom. Super basic, wondering how I was doing and asking what my plans for coming home for the holidays were. 

Like every college guy who gets emails from their mom, I kinda blew it off. I told myself I would reply later, when I had more time. She died the next day. 

She had a chronic heart condition that she had contracted from her pregnancy with me. The doctors thought it was so under control she could extend the time between her visits. But, that morning as she was getting ready for the bible study she had attended for decades, she just died. No one was in the house. But even if we were there; Even if she was already at the hospital, it was so sudden, they couldn't have done anything.

She just died. It wasn't dramatic or painful. It was just the end of her time on this earth.

I would love the chance to respond to her email. You never have more time than you have right now.

At least her management saw the reality of the situation and correctly blamed her.  We've seen too many stories in this sub of managers blaming IT because you're the computer people so it's *always* your fault.
"That section of the handbook you mention needs to be changed!  
There's no logical reason for anyone(besides IT in rare cases) to log in as anyone else. "
"I wouldn't say that she was challenged by technology.   
She challenged technology!   
She's right, too. A lot of the devices we use have way too many buttons and awkward non-intuitive user interfaces.   
Some remotes these days have all but the most important buttons hidden under a sliding cover, but not nearly enough of them.  And when the buttons gets Red, Blue or Green symbols in addition to the white ones, to show 'alternate' functionality based on something or other...    
Half the time I'm pushing buttons(besides source select or volume) on the TV remote I'm just guessing and hoping to hit the right one.  
I seem to have stopped using the 'channel up/down' buttons on the TV remote now... finally... nearly a year after I got fibre broadband and a Broadband TV box.    
Then there's the stereo remote that is supposedly a universal remote...   
The last time I tried to use the 'universal' functions to skip a chapter on the DVD player, my ancient VHS went into Fast Forward...

"Ooof. I would have taken down names, time/date, make/model, serial numbers, etc. and contacted legal immediately. Even if I threw out the computer equipment myself, it wouldn't be my call to make. CYA."
"Cmos battery is probably dead, it'll lose the time again if the power goes out / power strip gets turned off, it'll happen again "
"hey, at least $USER apologized!"
"&gt;Oh, and about half an hour after I get the software working, I get a reply from the forum with a link to a 3.8 MB .zip file. 

Dam.
"
Yes it did no problem
"&gt; he had somehow managed to set a screenshot of his desktop to open on boot

Wow. I had to think for a solid minute about how would I achieve that."
"So, did you fix his internet or what?"
"Well, on the bright side, if there are too many players and it somehow overloads the circuits, causing an ignition, you could have chess nuts roasting on an open fire!"
"As an aside, following that incident, I changed my emulator settings so that the text and background for each environment was colour coded (with production having ""PRODUCTION"" in flashing red letters at the top of screen).
"
Was suspecting this after I read Small form factor. Try the Tiny PC's out and you'll definitely get hit with this by more users not knowing what they are looking at.
"At least the penny dropped. I was 100% expecting something like ""...but _I'm_ not Tim!!"" at the end. "
"Well?

Did it work?"
"Yeah, well  some people just dont have alot of experience. Its the husbands fault really, he should have explained it. She gets kudos from me for being knowledgeable enough to call tech support."
"Funny, when I'm turned on I can't get any work done at all."
"Dammit EA, next they'll be lootboxing my food"
...was the manager seen again?
That sounds like someone coming from either extreme poverty or extreme wealth.
"I got so blindsided by the ""WHERE'S THE HARD DRIVE?"" question that I didn't even consider this possibility.  I just figured everyone else had already checked that."
"Sorry but I cannot follow your story. Did the big boss ask you to set up the chess tournament or was that decided beforehand? Did you actually set it up and got fired because head of IT didn't like what you were doing? Did try to seem busy and didn't set it up and got fired for that? It is most likely me, but I find it very difficult to understand what happened between ""chess tourny decided"" and ""my colleague got fired""."
"Haha yeah, I met a guy at my office that had had two monitors for several years but had always just mirrored the two. Though the whole thing was rather useless and I agreed. Blew his mind when I set them up adjacent."
TIL that receiving phone calls means the phone system is down.
"Hah.

I'll guarantee the phrase ""Why am I doing ITs job anyway?"" got thrown around at least once. Because as we all know our job stops at reinking printers."
"and the fact she realised her mistake when explained. I totally get the loop she got her self into . Totaly reasonable. She just needed to think about why it's showing that message, and not face value. "
"Why are you suggesting I read the labels on these fields? That would be logical.

I AM NOT A LOGICS PERSON!"
"I would suggest that you get the contact details of every company's IT person.   
That way you can say 'We will start fixing it immediately,' and when the (l)user hangs up, call the IT person and talk to him/her and get the issues resolved.   
Even better, make their IT person be the 'official contact', the only one who's supposed to call you at all, and teach him/her how to do basic fault-finding regarding the phones. "
"Wow, we've had people run over laptops and tablets with every kind of motor vehicle you can think of, but never taken a pliers to the inside of a desktop. Glad to hear she is fired and will not be getting unemployment."

Section 326 of the US Patriot Act requires a physical address to be on file. I only know this because I recently opened a new account...
"I think it was like this:
#0: Is it even there
#1: Is it even plugged in
#2: Is it even on
#3: Did you try turningit on and off again"
"I don't know if there was any deeper investigation, but he told me it was quickly apparent the equipment was the same that had been sent for disposal. The thieves had other equipment in the van from the same recycling station, but only ours was still marked with company name and info.  

It wasn't really company property anymore since it had been given to the company doing the recycling. "
"&gt; Do you have an Android or a MoneyTaker?
Nice."
"It's the existence of people like this, that there's a check box to indicate your a terrorist on immigration forms."
"""High call volume.. Maybe I'm not the only one with the problem. Let me try it every 10 minutes or so and see if they fix it while I'm on hold"""
Rule 3 (?) of troubleshooting: Is it even turned on?
