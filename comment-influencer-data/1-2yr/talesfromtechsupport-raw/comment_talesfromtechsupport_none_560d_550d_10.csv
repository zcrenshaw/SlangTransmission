"Upgrading to Windows 10 moves the power button? Man, that sounds inconvenient. Also, this is your fault somehow."
Good on your boss for not letting one bad day tank his opinion of you.
"Supporting sales is my least favorite part of working in IT. I've had better luck explaining to my grandfather with Alzheimer's how to use his iPhone than I have had showing a sales rep something new on their laptop.

The worst part is the acceptance of blame. Somehow everything is our fault. It's like dealing with toddlers who've just learned how to lie.

Edit: spelling and words

Edit 2: I've never gotten this many upvotes before. This is a proud moment for me."
"As long as you don't drop it, and bring it back later. Make sure to ask the elders for permission next time"
"I hate it when a member of my IT department makes an idiot embarrassing error like this.   

Especially, since I'm the entire IT dept. here."
And now you know why she didn't want a record of her stupidity. 
I don't want to be judgemental.... But maybe this is related to the divorce.
"&gt; I've been told that 2 emails were sent and our employee still doesn't have access to her computer. Please come down now and set her up.

This is when I forward the 2 previous emails to her, showing the times she emailed.  This sounds like an employee trying to get out of work for the day by blaming IT."
"You plugged in the WiFi cable and made the WiFi work again.
"
"Well, if it's easy, then YOU should have no trouble figuring it out, why are you calling me?"
"I'm going to imagine how the conversation went at home.

$ITHusband: It might be a software issue, but I shouldn't touch it because it is your work computer and I don't have permission to work on it. Ask your IT at work to check it out

Snobbywife hears: its software problem, blame your work IT, my stuff is fine.

Because that is the only exchange that doesn't make me want to beat both of them with a bat..."
"I have a user who occasionally says he ""can't access"" a system and, as proof, provides a screenshot of him being logged into the system and getting some very obvious error when he does something specific.

Quite often it's a typo where he's misspelled the name of his own script and gotten ""command not found""."
"It's not that she didn't want a log of her stupidity, it's she didn't want a log showing what I told her vs what she *says* I told her.

CYA. From what she did type in chat shows some unprofessionalism, and I logged right away what happened and told my manager, so if she tries anything she'll regret it."
"Umm.. Hi, how do I get you to be my ISP?"
"Too late, they already have typed google into google."
During beta it didn't even have a power button. It was awful; you had to buy a power button from Stardock if you wanted to turn your PC off.
"I always read ""POS"" in my head as ""Piece of S***"" which seems to apply more often than not to POS systems.  Also I curse manufacturers who put power switches on the back of things - they should be easy to find with a large, friendly label."
"do the 'follow up' email and say as discussed i reviewed xyz and blabla... heres your ticket # in case you experience the issue again you can try this and that. 

great way to CYA and also have documentation of what was done at the same time"
"Yes, this is a great manager :)"
"I remember doing routine updates/scans at an elementary school years ago, and a couple of the kids were sooooo stoked that I was ""doing cool things with the computer.""  
everything I did (which was boring shit to me) was amazing to them.  
told them they could learn how to do it too if they wanted to.  
It blew their minds and made my day."
ooh the boss gave you a hazard pay increase! XD
"I’ve worked in retail computer/cellphone for the past seven years, it truly is shocking how many people try to blame us personally for something on the new device not being the same as the old device. The funniest one is how many people think I should know what their email address and password is.. 

Yes I’m the keeper of all user/pass for all devices. "
"There are many ways to fix this, as OP well knows, but here's one:

As part of the upgrade, give them a new desktop background that includes your corporate logo and ""Windows 10"". That won't get everybody (you will have some users who will not understand things like ""right click your task bar and then left click Show Desktop"") but it will get a lot of them.

Of course making use of one of the many options for determining this remotely or populating a CMDB automatically is the best, but not every shop can do that in a reasonable timescale.
"
"Best you are out of there, as that really is a company that utterly relies on IT to do it's work, but absolutely does not realise that."
OP already said that they work in sales. 
"Fortunately, this was over chat and not phone. I cannot begin to tell you how much I do not miss phone calls, especially with people that don't listen."
this person doesnt want to do actual work and needs someone to blame
"Yep. Which is why we usually make sure our manager is aware of this, before the sup comes yelling at him.. "
"Oh, nothing important; just all the test scripts for the accounts receivable applications for a Fortune 500 with global brand recognition."
AT least she didn't lie and argue with you about how it was your fault.
"""Well, the menu is grey.""

""Grey?""

""There's a blue bar that says Windows 98. Is that important?"""
"I have a growing impatience for users who literally work on a PC every day of their life, its part of their job. Yet they claim to ""not be a computer person"". I don't expect you to rebuild the thing but stop being pathetic, this is your job. "
she was [major-project panicked](https://xkcd.com/1658/)
"Wowser!

You sure she isn't being mind controlled by a imposter or something?"
that is a scary level of addiction to a pay to win game... holy crap!
"&gt;Had a ticket that the user submitted through the intranet system that literally only said ""WiFi Adapter"", gave her computer name, and nothing else.

Closed - Rejected. My job here is done."
"Only thing I can think of is perhaps the Shutdown option used to be disabled, but an update quietly enabled it and she started using it because she had always been told to shut down computers when she was done?"
Well you've for sure found a rare breed of client there!
"&gt; We expect you to do the impossible with no budget and on a strict deadline, while being paid enough per week to sustain your family for two days and no overtime.

96% of TFTS tales are this, yet it never gets old."
"Are you using a compressor?

FYI a compressor will condensate water and will spray tiny droplets. (for more info, see car paint with compressor)

I wouldn't use that with electronics.  

keyboards sure, laptop ports and PCBs ish..."
i wonder when she is using the VM for a few years what made her decide to press another button instead of keep using disconnect...
TIL some folk have never knowingly used an internet connected device that was not wireless
"My old boss once told me :"" If the end user doesn't have a shortcut for the program that he uses on his desktop or taskbar the program isn't installed for him."""
"This wasn't something I expected to read on this sub, a bit more wholesome than usual. I like it."
"1080ti

"Once an email escalates to 2 emails, my supervisor becomes BCC on all email correspondence from that point forward.  Occasionally I will put him on CC, but that is only if I need the backup behind it.  A lot of people are afraid of him."
How do I Alt-F4 on mobile? I want to see your flair. 
"Hopefully she can turn out to be the unicorn we all search for, now that she realized that she needs to know more and if she asks.. you will explain."
"You say *assault*, I say *pushing out a hotfix to the live environment to address critical bugs*"
"If it makes you feel any better just keep in mind that odds are pretty good that her dad probably doesn't actually live with her or have a pacemaker, let alone one connected to those phone lines. Almost all of the ""super urgent"" excuses to get immediate service are total BS.

I just looked it up and from my brief reading pacemakers connected to phones lines are for convenience since they don't need to go to the doctor's office all the time to have data read out. They are *not* connected for any real-time life saving reasons."
"next time carry a small box labeled ""Internet"" with you and put cookies and cat pictures in it!

edit: extra points for shouting:""I brought back the internet and let me tell you, it is delicious!"" (in a ""preachers"" voice) "
"I would thought that she would try pressing any buttons on the computer to get it started, and would stumbled on the magic power button then. "
"If she didn't follow proper procedure to open a ticket and didn't provide any way of contacting her other than ""step and fetch"", then the fault is her own, not OP's. He's not her lapdog to be beckoned at the snap of her fingers. I wish more IT folk had a backbone like this and refused to be walked all over."
"expacting the ball to drop all the way through the Story... and everyone lived happily ever after?
I feel like the force has been disturbed!"
TIL not having access to the internet is now classed as an emergency. 
Rule #1 of tech support: *Users lie!*
"I can just about see it now, the scene in the office...

&gt;Lazy Lady: At last! Now that SCSM has stopped messing me around, I can get some work done!

&gt; Manager: Alright, let's get to training! Open APP.

&gt; Lazy Lady: Uh... *{opens Outlook}*

&gt; Manager: No, open APP.

&gt; Lazy Lady: Oh, yeah. *{opens a second instance of Outlook}*

&gt; Manager: Huh. I'm starting to think I see what SCSM's problem was.

&gt; Lazy Lady: *{closes both Outlook instances}* Sorry about that.

&gt; Manager: Okay, just open APP now.

&gt; Lazy Lady: *{opens Outlook again}*

&gt; Manager: You know what? Don't bother."
"I always use ""Okay, open up your start menu. The little flag button on your keyboard. And is the menu blue or black? And does it cover the whole screen?""

If they've bothered to personalize the start menu color, they know what OS they're running."
