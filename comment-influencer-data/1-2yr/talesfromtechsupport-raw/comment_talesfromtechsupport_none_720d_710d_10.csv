This isn't normal stupid... this is *advanced* stupid.
"If she hadn't lost her marbles, you should have given her an iPhone 4 and drew an X on it with one of those silver paint markers.

I'd say give her a 3GS, but NOBODY deserves that."
"&gt;WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE ISSUES?!

Because you lack the qualifications necessary to perform your job functions. I'll notify your supervisor that you require immediate remedial training. Until then, your system access has been revoked as a precaution."
"Users like this is why it is so important to have a large stack of ""slightly outdated"" replacement devices (several versions behind)"
I strongly dislike when people treat hardware like this. Not the money...but just... poor device..
I always liked to help those. They don't demand shit from you but know that you are the one making her day a bit easier!
Forget an iPhone. She clearly needs a 90's era Nokia. Those things are just made for clumsy fingers like hers.

"""I'm not good with computers!""

""Well you boss seems to think you are, because he put one on your desk. If you can't operate it, I'll let him know."""
I think every time I see a young teenager with a brand new iPhone and Day 1 the screen is cracked. They literally can't comprehend the value of the technology in their hands.
"* You lied on your resume
* You weren't properly trained

Pick which one you want me to tell your boss."
"Yep, that's why I have some older T440's hidden away, juuuust in case. "
She did all this to get an iPhone X? What was her plan for the month+ before the iPhone X actually ships?
"I mean, we are obviously dealing with someone in the know, I'm sure she'd expect me to get apple to ship her one early or something. "
I hope the manager takes care of this and doesnt just blame you for having to replace her computer. She sounds like an idiot whos stuck in her ways
Please tell me she has to pay for the damaged property! You have the video evidence.
"That is outside of my domain, but I hope so too."
You got my hopes up that I'd be in for an adventure.
I know a guy who got canned for just that offense lol.  check my post history. 
"Even better, a ruggedized [Nextel i58sr](https://i.imgur.com/FlSSuEd.jpg)."
"**Congratulations!**

You have successfully completed Demon Banishing 101!

Next Class, Mind Reading 201."
"That's not stupidity, it's entitlement."
"So far the manager has been cooperating and asking for training materials (which she should know... Not me...) and any ideas on how to help.

The user isn't looking good right now. Even the manager said not knowing how to unplug the mouse was something else. Thank God for chat logs, this is exactly why I email and chat with my userbase more than use the phone.

CYA and log everything folks, this is why."
"I don't get people who just start clicking random buttons or options. One time during a training session I told a lady to hit cancel on a window on her computer to cancel her last action. She hit OK, then the X on the main window, hit the start button, and logged off. I was completely floored. She said ""Oops! I think I hit the wrong button!""


Try 5 wrong buttons...""accidentally""...."

"I week 1 cracked my S7 Edge screen in a shitty accident. It wasn't shattered or particularly severe, so I dealt with it until the S8+ price and the cracked screen were close enough in value.  
The cracked screens that happen day 1 aren't what bothers me... It's when they demand a replacement or decide that since it's damaged they should care less. If it's just annoying cosmetic damage, just deal with it and be more careful."
What if juuuuust in case you should mail one for me :D
"Don't think about getting your co-workers pizza, just do it.
The little things like getting a simple comfort food for your guys let's them know you are one of them and you appreciate them. Brings up morale after dealing with people like the EA."
"An adult acting like a spoilt child because there's a shiny new toy.

Some people never grow up. I find that extremely disturbing for some reason, like sick to my stomach, not sure why."
"17 help center agents out of work for ""incompetence"", but he'll pay 25k for the whims of that clerk? Why is he making his mom work at all?"
"&gt;  And the desire to sleep was waiting in a dark corner with a tire iron, preparing to mug the winner.

ahahaha!!!!!! i like that!!!!! made me actually laugh."
Tech support by stripping? That's a new one! 
"&gt; My boss of course took credit for the work and conveniently left me out of the report.

Oh man that kind of crap does NOT fly with me.

"Wish more would see it this way! Accept and thank help, not demand."
"We actually have a ticket sub-category called ""Training Issues"". When I run our metrics, I can generate reports showing (for example) the top ten issues reported over the last quarter that were attributable to improper user training and how much it has cost the company in real dollar amounts and lost productivity. I can present that in our management meetings and hold their supervisors responsible for failing to properly train their employees.

My department is IT and Help Desk. Not Training. We don't train users, we're not responsible for their training, and it's not our job to make sure an employee is qualified to do their job. It took me and my staff a long time to get us to this point but it's paid off."
"Well, I did have an SE available, but in our recon tests it would fail to recognize touch some of the time, so we didn't wanna do that.

Though now I wish we had :( "
I have a couple of Virginia's at my MSP job. They might know fuck all about tech or the basics on how to operate a PC but they're so nice that I'm more than happy to work around that shortcoming to get them where they need to be. Even if it is like 15 calls over 2 days.
"How can people be so fucking stupid. Unbelievable.  
I need to tell IT and HR I need 1080Ti for my office work... and administration rights."
RIP nice 64 gig Rose Gold iPhone 6s.
Good thing they didn't swallow; no-one these days uses ate-bit.
I don't mind computer illiterate people. I mind computer illiterate people who are ignorant of their illiterateness.
She tried....üòÇ
"I'm colorblind as hell, so the Rose Gold looks like it's dipped in crap to me.  "
You know about r/idiotsfightingthings I hope? It‚Äôs pretty close. 
Why not both?
"Power over USB is pretty common (see cell phones chargers), but I've never seen a monitor try it."
"of course, Already placed the order for Pizza and steak and cheese calzone. "
Did you find out if your mechanic was a ghost or an alien? perhaps alien ghost?
Why does this not surprise me...?
"Please let us know if she gets removed from her trainer position. I've had to deal with people training me for jobs they had no idea how to do and it is the most frustrating thing. 

""So, you're supposed to do this thing by going through twenty unnecessary steps.""

""... Couldn't I just do these two steps instead?"""
Why are you even still doing business with them?
We've been pushing our boss to sever ties for a long time and it's a huge source of frustration for us. Boss is trying to do everything in her power not to piss them off because she's worried they'll smear us in the industry. At this point she's starting to see this isn't something we should be putting up with anymore and is ready to let them go... so fingers crossed. I'd rather not deal with them anymore. 
"That was my exact thought.   She committed vandalism to her company's property... all to get a phone that is NOT EVEN OUT YET.   It was the iPhone 8 that was just released.   

The X is not coming until November, and probably is already sold out on preorders (Apple warned about small supply)."
"I like your thought process here, and I really like the options presented by commenters, however.....  I‚Äôve been handed company cell phones since the last guy departed. I‚Äôm seeing a bunch of this shit going on. One guy even claimed that his phone was stolen. 

Luckily for me, I issued stolen iPhone dude‚Äôs iCloud information and told him to reset. They never do, so I was able to log in and use find my iPhone to locate. It was on site.....  I also had a hunch that this not so bright individual actually had the phone on him as I heard a buzz while talking to him (he doesn‚Äôt have a personal). What did I do?  I loaded Find My iPhone on my phone and as I was about 2 feet away from him I said ‚ÄúHey, I think I found your phone‚Äù then proceeded to turn on the beeper at max volume. It was in his pocket. 

I looked at his pocket and said ‚ÄúHuh...  there it is‚Äù and walked away. "
"I knew how this story would be going once I read the title.

How can be somebody that stupid, even if you are not an at will employee in a lot of locations intentional destruction of company assets is enough cause to fire you and if you are not amongst the first people to get a new gadget then you are also unlikely to be amongst the people who can get away with it not just once but twice."
"&gt;having removed the managers from the chain

Ahh the ol ""If I remove the manager CCs from my reply, maybe they won't find out it was my fault."" "
"Thank you thank you for including a picture of the unit.  A lot of times the descriptions are pretty good but seeing a picture adds that exclamation point.

Any idiot could see that he fucked that machine over good. People are just dumb"
"The problem is, many, including your mother do not have an accurate model of how the internet works or even computers work in general. The problem is we, as techies have a far better model of how the internet works (and PCs) and all the methods of getting connected to it. What we need to do is somehow explain in a model that they understand, how to connect to the net. I actually like the idea of the Internet is a series of pipes analogy, even if more tech savvy people laughed at it. Its a good way for non tech savvy people to have a better understanding of it. 

Remember that we may not have such a great model of maybe law and when we say 'stupid' things you can imagine a lawyer laughing in his/her head about how stupid you must be to think like that. Even if the Internet is everywhere, not everyone understands it and we should be more understanding of that fact. "

"I've seen people gently drop their iPhone on their matress back in the day and the screens would crack.

I think they're fixed now, but iPhones used to be *insanely* fragile, through no fault of the owner. Most people I know just rolled with it."
"If you like my writing you can find a list of my other tech support tales [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Merkuri22/comments/70vmvq/tales_from_tech_support_index/).

Do not read that second series if you haven't played before - spoilers ahoy.  And I'll shove a lightsaber down the gut of anyone who tries to spoil the game for me (though I'm already past The Big One, IYKWIM)."
"Just call them up and drop her name, and a special prerelease unit will be at your door tomorrow!"
"She called up the day we got it because she couldn't work out how to plug it up.

I told her before the service was finalized 5 times how to plug it up and she still connected it like a XDSL service.

I love her dearly."
"&gt;At the end she changed her wallpaper to photo of a turkey dinner.

"iPhone 7 and iPhone 6s, that's about $1400 in hardware depending how they calculate. Probably enough for a small claims suit but I doubt a big corp. is going to take the time, they'll spend more in legal fees than they would recoup.

Idiots like this often don't get a good comeuppance, hence why they keep acting the way they do. I work in a small shop, if we had someone pull shit like this, my boss would fucking bury them."
