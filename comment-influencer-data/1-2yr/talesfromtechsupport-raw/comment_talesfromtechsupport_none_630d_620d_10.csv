Those weren't farts they were fuel emissions from the hand's computer parts.
"Perfect world: You got a heartfelt apology for them accusing you of trying to get out of work you never did before.

Real world: They then proceed to insist you just figure out what the other guy did (which, naturally, isn't documented anywhere) and get it done, instead of continuing to stubbornly insist you have no idea what to do."
This has to be the tenth time I have read this story and yet my brain cannot accept it.
"""M"" as in ""Mancy!"""
"later... ""I can't access my files!"""
It is at least possible that she intentionally showed you that picture.
"&gt;told the lady if she was out of her mind  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ended up being one the first people to get a flatscreen monitor

She knew what she was doing."
"Thankfully the email actually spells out what was done.  

The best part about it was, it wasn't just before I got here.  It was all the way back when the guy before me was new. Almost 12 years ago. "
"Doctors - Check    
Lawyers - Check    
Simple problem - Check    
User ability to somehow suddenly forget how computers work in 5 minutes while simultaneously calling for help while telling you 'don't bother' - Check    
Knowing this guy somehow operates on you and prosecutes you - Priceless.
"
User account permissions are an important thing
"I was zo expecting the customer to go on an angry rant, such a nice call however. Not many people who are as cooperative as her "
"1: What CIO threatens to fire a new employee while nobody else could solve the problem...
2: Damn, RNJesus must've been with you for you to find that post"
"This is a good day? This is ""one in a million"" day. Considering the horror stories I read on this sub, that customer was very, very, very chilled out."
"I wasn't an employee, I was a consultant brought in specially as a peace offering so they wouldn't rip out Brocade and put in Cisco. No one warned me the customer was upset. I was told I was hired to implement monitoring and was all excited to help. After that, I read the account manager the riot act for not telling me.

RNJesus was definitely kind that day. Lol."
Nope.  I don't think it even crossed their mind. 
Why would they apologize to *the help*?
Permissions shmermissions! Just give everybody access to everything!! What could possibly go wrong?^everything^everything^can^go^wrong
'No. You don't want them connected to your PC.'
That's super messed up. No apology I bet too.
She had to restart her phone and I called back 5 minutes and 30 minutes later. The phone is still off
" I read the title, and before I even clicked I was mentally yelling ""LIAR!"""
"Teasing, in IT. Never thought I'd see the day."
"&gt;I'm the best at technology.

And then

&gt;You don't know what type of motherboard you have?

&gt;No.

Seems legit."
The one that comes up but my brain can’t accept are the ones where people put stuff they need by putting it in trash/deleted. 
IT IS SAD WHEN FELLOW HUMANS TRY TO INCORPORATE MACHINE PARTS.
Keep in mind that that the ordinary mundane calls (which make up the bulk of what most of us get) aren't the sort of thing that gets posted here.  Most people aren't horrible.  Most people just want their stuff to work.  
"User: How long is it going to take?

Me: 12 Parsecs."
Rule #1: Users Lie.
She should have been one of the last to get a flat-screen monitor in the hope that she'd remove herself from the gene pool before that. 
"Whenever someone tells me i fixed something x months/years ago and get upset i can't remember how to fix it i ask what they had for lunch the day i helped them.  Some will ask how that is relevant and i tell them i got x support cases a day, they only had lunch once that day."
You skipped the part where 5 minutes later she complains about not being able to see family photos. 
Ugh this. I work IT for a manufacturing company and all the offices in the plant still have crts. All shipments also come through the plant so if they receive a pallet of fresh lcds just ordered by my dept. suddenly 3 or 4 of their crts will start having “flickering” trouble 
"&gt;Finding an answer on page 3 of an almost unrelated forum post

As is tradition"
Too many bones
"&gt; User: Well how long is that going to take? I'm super busy.

No, you dont get to make this my fault. If you were super busy, you shouldn't have fucked up your computer."
"My first IT manager taught me the skill of looking without seeing. Valuable IT skill, that. "
"I was an indy recording studio tech - building, installing updates and repair. I had a client who probably had been dashing through the snow one too many times, threaten me with firing. I came in with a ground hum issue to find, and was there barely 20 minutes, when the guy came in and threatened to fire me. Told me I had been screwing around (I was looking for ungrounded devices and ground loops) and to fix it now or get out. I didn't say a word. I packed up and walked out. And told the other indy techs about him. He went four days before someone came in to fix the problem. Yep - bad audio path grounding... "
"Wait, IT ""*people*""? You know you've got pretty good users when they actually view you as a person."
You’re a local admin. You’re a local admin. Everybody is a local admin!
"T as in tsunami  
K as in knee  
M as in mnemonic  
E as in Erin  
W as in why.

I used to use these when people upset me..."
Didn't you know IT people are interchangable? She probably couldn't tell you guys apart. 
"I will admit that as an admin JR, I've advised some users to ""accidently pour coffee"" over their old as hell machine  (Windows XP embedded thin client) that had trouble turning on, but since they still turned on, management did not want to replace them, causing us to have at least 15 tickets daily concerning those alone.



Causing their death somehow made our work a lot easier as they were replaced because of ""accidents"""
N as in nary.
"Exactly. its a byproduct of the heat generated by the power supply. with modern cybernetic implants, its easier to route their heat exchangers exhaust through the digestive tract. the only side effect is a severe case of the walking farts. this should be common knowledge to anyone that uses technology. "
Mildly curious. How did you block her (assuming here) Windows network discovery from the server side?
"&gt;But really, who in their right mind just throws out every single thing that comes with the installation package, without consulting the manual, without calling the helpdesk or anything?!

(l)User do. 

Also folks who have heard about [WiMax](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/wimax.htm) and expect Wifi to be the same."
