Maybe she should suck some dick for shoes instead.
Your unborn child is the only thing in your life with shittier roots than your hair
That titles a lie and you know it.

You're telling me this picture is the best one out of 30?
That’s nice you dad shared his weed with you 
You look like you've jerked off to more comics than Louis CK
I see you failed art school as well. 
"You definitely fit the profile of some idiot that thinks this is clever. 

And subtracting -$1 means you have to donate for every post, jabroni."

Is that plate the size of your arsehole now? 
"Let’s be honest, the closest she’s ever been to dick was the biography of Richard Nixon she read for AP history "
I'd grab my used condoms out of the trash before I left your house 
"Your skin tone, dress, personality and wall all are the same shade of dull."
Almost your entire post history is you posting pictures of yourself with a poor pre-disposition towards yourself to chase positive comments you needy emo. Grow up and get off the internet. 
You look like a journalist from BuzzFeed
I misread titles as titties
"I bet you will be the 3rd hottest Chili's waitress in 10 years.
"
"How did this happen with your ""anal only"" policy?"
You look like you change your hair color every other week because everything else about you is so uninteresting. 
Looks like Skrillex got polio or something. 
She's probably got another pair tucked away in those saddlebags.
Leakage.
Your mom clearly didn't take a 9 month break. Why should you?

"Life isn't roasting you, they're roasting your parents, who just wasted $100k on trying to get you somewhere."
Do you use the unisex bathrooms get to keep people guessing?
You're definitely not cool or popular enough to turn wetsuit pants into a fashion trend.
"So you want attention but not hurt feelings. That’s just as pitiful as the Instagram girls coming here for compliments, you fucking hairy mangina. I bet the closest you’ve gotten to having sex is when you try and suck your own dick with your pussy face. Get real dude. Go post on toast me if your self esteem is that low. Because no one on this sub wants to be responsible for your suicide when you off yourself to a comment that you couldn’t handle."
John Slow 
You look like every college guy's backup when his first three 1 am phone calls are busy.
The picture cuts off the top of your fivehead.  How much further up does it go? 
"
After soaking up tears those tissues get a second life in that bra"
You misspelled “validate me like instagram” 
Which Kardashian brother are you?
Maybe if her ass wasn’t half way down her thighs she wouldn’t have to suck dick for weed 
Lucky for you that dick size doesn't matter when you're a bottom
Your hair has less volume than a 90 year old world war 2 veteran’s hearing ability. 
That was actually his older sibling’s fate.
No that was actually meth
"Why is a girl that is prone to body dysmorphia and depression posting on this sub? Answer; the only thing she is prone to is a desire for attention and validation. 

I don't want you to cry, I want you to go away. Stop posting about your self you egomaniacal, self centered, only child. Maybe you wouldn't be so socially awkward if you took the time to think about someone other than yourself.

"Both look trans to me, but no fkn idea which way you're transitioning. "
What are you donating to? Are you going to donate to get r/incels unbanned? You look like the type.
Use an improper integral to calculate the area under that huge nose 
"If you put on any more makeup, I think we could enter you into an Art gallery as an impressionist painting.

You might also consider losing the hooker hoops and trying for a haircut that suits your face, think ""bangs"" because I don't see you getting the digits with the sun reflecting off your sweaty fivehead.

Some of your toes are longer than your fingers and it freaks me out. I bet you could peel a banana with those things.

She is so bony sleeping with her would be like fucking a sack full of elbows. 
"Hey man, that's almost as charitable as anyone who has sex with you"

"Just by looking at this, my virginity returned "
"Lucky for you, you'll suck your way to a middle management position where you'll stay for the rest of your miserable life while your husband relentlessly cheats on you on the sole purpose to see a set of eyes with life in it "
"You were supposed to roast him, not the rest of us. "
"I'll donate $2 to you for your post: one for correcting his grammar, and one because you keep using this word ""jabroni"" and it's awesome."
I'm not surprised you're failing business school. Someone who spends 97% of their funds on makeup obviously doesn't know how to handle finances.
Have you been inside a Sephora? Ain’t cheap. I need my make up to last thru at least 5 cum shots.
Didn’t know diabetes turned people into wax?

Happy 50th birthday
I’m drawn to emotionally abusive relationships.
Sorry you never got to see that shrimp boat.
By truck you mean white panel van? Correct?

When reading these roasts I constantly have to scroll back up to see what you look like again because I can't remember what you look like for more than 5 seconds. 
Thank you in advance for not breeding.
