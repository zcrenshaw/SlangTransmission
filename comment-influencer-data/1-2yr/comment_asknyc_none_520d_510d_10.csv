"Utter disdain for pizza and bagels from other places.

Crossing lights are just suggestions.

I've grabbed a metrocard out of a tourist's hand and swiped it for them because they were taking too long."
Yes yes let the hate flow through you my child 
"I don't necessarily think New York is perfect, but it's better than *everywhere* else."
"I'm not a native. When I was walking to work, someone stopped abruptly in front of me, and I *yelled* at them to move. That's when I knew."
Wear 99% black clothing. High BS detector. Resting mean face. No interest in small talk. Readily willing to push people in my way. Fast walking. Extremely strong opinions about food and transit directions. I think I'm always right. Disdain for NJ.
"I recently finished school and moved to Brooklyn. I got myself a hair cut, my first tattoo, and a new pair of glasses to celebrate.

My new roommates then took me to a concert in Prospect Park where I saw 300 other girls with the same haircut, tattoo placement, and glasses. 

And that's when I realized I accidentally became a Brooklyn hipster in 10 days."
"That’s it. People ask “do you like living there?” 

No, but where the hell else am I gonna go?"
"Self locking and self closing exterior doors are required by the Multiple Dwelling Law. The doors must be kept locked at all times unless you have a lobby attendant.

A buzzer and intercom are required if your building has more than eight units and was built after 1968. 

An intercom is required in buildings built before 1968 if the majority of tenants request them, but the costs incurred can be passed on to the tenants. 

You can call 311 to trigger an HPD inspection for the propped door.  If they come out and see it like that, they'll issue a violation.  Your landlord may or may not care enough but they can issue a Notice to Cure to the neighbors who are propping open the door and begin on the path to a holdover eviction but they're expensive and if those tenants pay their rent (especially if they're paying commercial rent) they may not act.  

You can call 311 on multiple occasions if the conditions persist and they'll issue additional violations if they come back out and the door is still propped.

I cook food instead of using Seamless/takeout every night. 
"I’ve given directions in American Sign Language

I’ve given directions in Spanish even though I don’t speak Spanish (points at map “yo soy aquí.... Empire State Building aqui... points in right direction)

I’ve walked a tourist to the right place because it was too hard to explain.

I’ve swiped metrocard a for tourists because a line was forming I thought they were gonna get stabbed (or at least yelled at)

I’ve gotten into a three way argument with three other New Yorkers giving the same tourist couple directions."
"BOND REALTY. Never use these fucks

Saw a 2 BR for 2k in the UES they posted. Called the agent asked if its available. He says yes and to meet him at his office. I ask if we can meet at the apt (as every other realtor i worked with has done that) He says no so whatever I meet at his office

They sit me down and try to do a full consultation on me. Asking my salary, hometown, how many bedrooms, etc. 

I say dude I thought we were going to check out that apt, is it still available? He says ""what apartment?"" I go the one that I'm here to check out that I called you about 3 times. He says it's not available

They go on to show me apartments that are either not in the UES, or out of my price range. I told them I had to be in queens soon and asked when we were gonna go look at places? They said in an hour or two. I immediately left after hearing that. 

Those guys fucking suck "
"The first thing I say whenever I get the bill at a bar or restaurant outside of NYC is ""wait that's it?!""

I just can't help it. I get so giddy."
"&gt; I’ve gotten into a three way argument with three other New Yorkers giving the same tourist couple directions.

This has to be the most NY thing in this thread lmao"
"So this is your call, but yes it could backfire. As well as it could be you doing him a solid. 

For *some* no-fee apts the building's company will pay the brokers. But these are crazy rare, usually only for building's that are having a really hard time filling up. These are not common, even in the financial district. The lease would explicitly say that the company is paying the broker fee.

Usually an apt is no fee because you work directly with the management, and no broker is involved hence no fee. If you use a broker to find a no fee apt, *you still have to pay a fee* unless there is some clause stating explicitly otherwise. 

So what is going on here? Well there is an 80% chance he is trying to screw you. 20% he is asking for a free favor. If you sign a lease and write that he was your broker, he now has official documents stating he was your broker. As of that moment he now has paperwork saying he is owed a fee. That means two things, one he could ask the building to pay him whatever bonuses and payouts they are handing out. Two, he could go after you for his 15% fee.

He is a stranger, who did not do any real work for you, asking you to sign a form letting him come after you for thousands of dollars. I wouldn't do it."
"Ha, just yesterday I was on the stairs coming off the subway. Some guy was trying to hit on a girl and said, “If you’re not gonna talk to me I’m just gonna stand right here”. Well, I was right behind him so without missing a beat I pushed him to the side while saying, “No you’re not” and continued down the stairs. 

The girl got a laugh and smiled at me. 
I did not get stabbed. "
"I refer to everywhere outside of the city, but still in NY state, as upstate."
"I'm a fast walker and I weave in and out of slow people on the sidewalk (which my husband finds annoying, but it's only because he's not as quick as I am). I also am not afraid to exit a train elbows out to keep people from pushing their way on before letting people off. And I'll lily say ""excuse you"" as I do it.

I also walk as often as I can, I don't have a car and prefer walking if the weather is nice enough to do so. 

I am definitely what some people call rude, but I call ""not in the mood for your bullshit"". I'll happily help a tourist with directions or make suggestions, but it's a lot easier and I'm a lot more polite if they get right to the point instead of hemming and hawking and ""excuse me please I have a question I'm from out of town and my mother is over there see wave at her she said to ask someone if they can...""

I've got an accent and when I leave NY people immediately know where I'm from. Not sure I like that.

I live in a shoebox of an apartment because the rent is good and I don't have a lot of stuff.

I'm friends with aspiring actors who bartend and wait tables to make ends meet.

Edit also I'm loud and have rbf."
I won’t date outside of my borough.
I know how to drive.
"""accidentally"""
"Same here! I’ve noticed that I vocalize my distain for stupid actions or assholes now. Being from the south, where everyone is “nice”, IT FEELS AMAZING."
For every person that came here and found success in the arts there’s 20 more who came here and found heroin.
"I once took lamb over rice, threw it in a pan and heated it up a little then cracked two eggs and made a scramble and it was amazing. I was also cripplingly hungover and probably high too but I stand by it. "

Totally agree with everything except disdain for NJ. It is such a “cool” thing to do to hate NJ. It really makes no sense though. I guess everyone has to feel superior to someone.
"This sub has helped me immensely with my transition to living here as well. Thanks from me, too!"
"Old one: Tourist from Midwest is walking up Madison Avenue and asks a New Yorker, ""Can you tell me where the Empire State Building is or should I just go fuck myself?"""
"I don't like to swarm the bus. People get so thirsty for seats. I like to go in an orderly line. In some parts of queens (that have a lot more Asian culture like flushing) people actually form a line to get into the bus.

And for some reason, people hate moving to the back of the bus when the bus is literally crowded. It's like everyone is Rosa Parks. But the matter is about space, not race. I always move to the back if I can. "
That I'm sick of living here but won't move.
Yup. I used to be a broker and came here to say this. I wouldn't do it. There's really nothing in it for you.
"I would go to r/legaladvice since this is beyond your standard “NYC living” situation. It seems like you are being put on the hook for all of the rent/damage, which doesn’t make sense, even if you have to pay for April/May. Unless you were the only person on the lease, “the other person won’t pick up the phone” doesn’t seem like a valid reason for you to pay someone else’s rent. "
7 train Hudson yards has a really long escalator that's a little trippy to walk up or down.
If you witness an altercation the best thing to do is get a nearby cop or station worker. But freezing happens and you can't always be the hero you want to be.
"/u/aurorium pretty much described me to a T (aside from the NJ hate). Here's some recent NY'er cliches I've experienced:

* I get unbelievably frustrated when someone decides to pay with cash at a Duane Reade and holds up the line while they count out DIMES ON THE COUNTER.

* The lady ahead of me on the bagel line had the audacity to have chit chat with the bagel guy ON A SATURDAY MORNING.

* While I avoid eye contact and confrontation 99% of the time, I will stare aggressively and say something if you cut the line. I notice that this is when many NY'ers will chime in and get your back, too. WE SEE YOU LADY, TRYING TO ""JUST ASK"" A QUESTION WITH YOUR ARMFUL OF ITEMS."
I wear a lot of color year-round instead of all black 
"That NYC is the best/only place they can live. I’ve lived in lots of different places (Midwest college town, tiny town in rural south, hipster Hudson River town) and liked them all in different ways. Ultimately I plan to relocate to a rural area, I have lots of rural hobbies. The only place I wouldn’t live is in any suburb of any major metro.

My parents however are just as provincial as the stereotype (ex: they once claimed, “you can’t have brunch in the Midwest”as if French toast with booze at 11am is something only NYCers are capable of comprehending. )."
"Definitely not. Born and raised New Yorker but lived in Montreal for 4 years. I’ve had bagels fresh from the oven at St Viateur and Fairmont bagels. They’re tough and lacking in flavor. Nothing like the chewy delicious goodness that surrounds me in New York 

Edit: microwaved stale New York bagels are better than fresh montreal bagels"
"Check your credit statement, the bill for the taxi ride should have the medallion number.
Then call 311 with the medallion number and they should be able to locate the driver.

Good luck mate-- I got my wallet back after leaving it in a cab this past summer. It's not impossible!"
I've been tired for three years
"I would also like to know: ""People that push their way to the door well before the train stops, insisting other people (many of whom are getting off at the same stop) let go of their handhold/balance and shuffle around for no reason, why do you do this?"""
"Broker who blew up on me for not texting her back during the day. I was working long days and not checking my phone, sent me 3 paragraphs about how unprofessional I was about not responding in a timely manner. 


Did not feel bad letting her know ""thank you for the help, but I think we'll just use someone else""."

The ONLY time it is ok to pull the emergency brake is if you see someone---oh, wait. No. Never. Use the conductor call button if there is an emergency. If you're in the station, block the door so it can't close and the train won't move. 

If you pull the emergency brake, they have to come file an incident report and manually unlock the brakes yadda yadda and you are going to be the cause of a fuckup that will ruin thousands and thousands of people's day. "
everything north of you is upstate
Everything north of central park is upstate to me.
"Oscar Wilde in Flatiron is literary themed and has a cool atmosphere, kinda funky decor and good drinks. I’ve heard the food is good as well. "
As a gay New Yorker: I hate going out and partying. I do not know what New York's hottest club is because I haven't been to one since college (and I wouldn't be surprised if that one's closed now). I love drag queens and drag culture but haven't gone to a show in years because I'd rather be at home in my PJs. I have never had a (serious) Grindr profile (I had a joke one for a while).
"Moved here last fall. Not so much a stereotype as funny habits I realized:

I check my “blindspots” when weaving through the sidewalk.

I don’t so much as look over or up from my phone or give it a second thought when a cab or other car tries to pull through the crosswalk when I have the right of way. (It took me a bit to not hesitate and reflexively stop walking, letting them by.)


But, when I really realized i had transformed, it was at Trader Joe’s a couple weeks ago. I’m from the south and like to avoid confrontation. I was riding up the escalator with my cart riding in the cart escalator next to me. Someone got off the escalator a bit before me but started to dawdle, looking at fruit or some shit, right at the cart escalator exit. I realized the impending back up, but hesitated, preferring to avoid the confrontation. Well, when my cart arrived at the top and was shoved by the escalator into the two people’s carts dawdling in front of me, they turned around and shot a look, exclaiming, “Reallly?!”

Me: “It’s a fucking escalator! It literally stops for fucking no one. Why don’t you keep a move on and quit holding everyone up?!”

They quickly realized their error and sheepishly moved along. "
Heartbreaking situation. I am sorry for you and for your beautiful Mishka. I hope you will find someone that deserves her.
"That's one of the roughest areas in NYC. You almost certainly won't be murdered but if you are prone to feeling uncomfortable, you will. It's also not a convenient location. In short, there are very good reasons it was cheap."
