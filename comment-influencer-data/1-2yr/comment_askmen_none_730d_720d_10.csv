"Don't:

* Call her

* Text her

* Stalk her social media

* Tell yourself you're never going to get over her

* Lament how you'll never find someone like her again

* Fall into self destructive habits like eating like shit and getting wasted every night 

Do:

* Delete her off social media, delete her number, and cut contact. _She_ broke up with _you_, so you don't owe her contact now. It's not like she's sitting at home thinking ""Welp, I broke up with him, but if he texts me and calls me enough times I'm definitely getting back together with him!"" She's not going to get sad about you not talking to her, so do yourself a solid and just cut contact now. You'd do it eventually anyway, so don't prolong the issue by playing the ""We're just gonna be friends"" game. You're not just friends if you're still sad.

* Remember you _will_ get over her. Everyone moves on eventually. You were dating for 2 years, which may seem like a long time to you but really isn't in the grand scheme. Do you think you're gonna be the first man in history who never moved on from his ex girlfriend? Nah. Don't be dramatic, you'll get over her if you let yourself. 

* You won't ever find anyone _exactly_ like her, which is a dam good thing because who she is ended up dumping you. You may find someone similar, or you may find someone totally different that actually meshes with you even better. There's billions of people in this world, the chances of your ex being the _one_ person who was compatible with you... again, lets not be dramatic. 

* Accept responsibility for your part in this. Forgiving yourself is cathartic. Maybe you could have done things differently, who knows. You can't go back in time to change those things, and you can't apologize your way out of them now. Accept it, learn from it. It will make your next relationship better 

* Work on self improvement. Nothing is better after a breakup than becoming better. It's a distraction and it boosts your confidence. Get your hair done at a good barber, grow a beard, hit up the gym, go to parties, learn a new skill. Become awesome! 

Worth mentioning: While hitting up online dating the day after a breakup seems to be the MO of a lot of people, I'd argue that you should avoid tinder and OKcupid until you've had at least a couple months to work through this. You're in no good mindset to be dating new women right now, and you're likely to just remind yourself how much you miss your ex by trying to pursue new people in that much volume. Plus there's inevitable rejection with online dating and you don't need that right now. Improve yourself, lean on friends, avoid your ex. Then get back out there. 

Edit: Thank you strangers for the gold!"
siri should give that speech when she notices that
We need this as an automated message that goes out to people who have been broken up with
"I changed my Facebook relationship status the other day to ""single"" and it offered to hide my ex's posts. We're getting there"
Pay off my credit card and then next month's rent. 
"My ex was one of those ""Instagram models"". Instagram this, Instagram that. Asking me to take ten thousand fucking pictures every day. Travelling to some boring fucking places just to take pictures there. She quit her day job because she was making 400€+ for every picture she posted. Sure, we got some nice free stuff, even a vacation (she had to take pictures in the resort and post them on her Instagram), but it was all so ... shallow. It was all about appearing to be happy, while our relationship was falling apart. She started hanging out with other instagram famous people and it was all about likes, ""pods"", ""give-aways"", ""collabs"" and shit like that.

I couldnt take it anymore and broke up with her. She made more money than I did, and I have a master in finance, so she got that going for her at least."
JUST FUCKING TELL HER 
"The one I feel the worst about was probably because it wasn't intended unlike most of the offensive comments I make.  I was in the middle of a high school class, and one of the dorkier girls (you know the ones big coke bottle glasses, always reminding the teacher about homework, but not actually that smart) was wearing a t-shirt supporting ice hockey.  Trying to be nice since everyone else gave her a hard time, I tapped her on the shoulder and said ""do you play or just watch?""  I realized I fucked up when I saw the look on her face and my buddies started laughing.  She storms off in a huff and I dumbfoundedly try to figure out where I fucked up when I see it was a shirt supporting special olympics hockey.  15 years later I still feel bad about it."
"The kind whose attitude is ""impress me"" and absolutely never feels the need to impress you back.

I know a few ""forever single"" types who are actually pretty cool as friends but the way they talk about dating I'm convinced they absolutely murder their chances with every guy just by showing up and expecting to be wowed, and feeling like they don't need to give a shit or be anything but an audience until he's spent a ton of money and gone all out for them. "
"loneliness, and contact those around you who seem like they’re going through a hard time to let them know you care"
The type that has to appear like they have the best of everything even though they are drowning in debt. 
"stand around the kitchen at one in the morning, tipsy, and eating canned peaches"
Well I was a virgin once. 
"I can't compete with that one man, that would scar me for life."
"Put the computers and phones away. Boom, you're on a date. 


cook together, bang, eat lukewarm food while you watch a movie that is agreeable, then get handsy after the movie. "
"Well, she was not my spouse because we were 19 at the time, but my girlfriend (let's call her Ana just so we don't get confused throughout the message) passed away. Around 1 year later I moved on and started dating another girl. Since the start she knew what I went trough. She was always very respectful, she never complained that I still kept some of Ana's things, and often looked at her pictures for some minutes smiling and crying at the same time. I am also very quiet and like being on my own on Ana's birthday, and she respects it, which is amazing.
Almost 4 years later, I still think of her, and she will always have a very special place in my heart."
"As a father of seven (four sons), forget asking things, DO things with him.  Have him do things you like and you try things he likes.   If he likes playing Minecraft or Tarreria, sit down and have him show you how to play it.   If you like working on cars, teach him what your doing and why and have him hand you tools when you ask for them.   Start a family game night.  Have the whole family play a board or card game.   It really pulls everyone together and gives you shared experiences to talk about later.   If you're not into those kinds of things, tough shit.  This isn't about what you like.  This is about building a relationship with your son and you're almost out of time.   Once he hits puberty, if you haven't built that relationship, it's going to be even harder if not impossible.   He's already 11, you need to start engaging with him NOW.   Movies, games, sports, whatever.   "
Watch YouTube videos and read Reddit till I fall asleep. Wake up the next day and repeat. My life sucks.
LPT: Body spray is not a substitute for a shower. Using body spray in an attempt to cover up body odor will create a repulsive mixture of the two smells. 
"After a long night of cooking, we were fooling around. She didn't want to have sex because she was on her period, so she starts to give me a handie.

We'd been making chili, and she had capsaicin on her hands.

It's a testament to her skill that she was able to finish the job. It was certainly an interesting sensation ..."

"Single moms.

I did it once and turned into a glorified babysitter. I can post the story here if anyone is curious. Sucked too because I got kind of attached to her kids.

Since it was requested the story below


&gt;Started dating a girl who was 20 with 2 kids, a 3 year and 6 month old, both girls. I know red flag central. Both girls were adorable and really sweet.

&gt;She couldn't afford a babysitter so our dates consisted of me going over to her place, hanging out and helping with the babies. Honestly it sounds terrible but wasn't that bad.

&gt;One day she asks me if I can babysit so she can run some errand. She said she'd be gone 30 minutes and the babies would be napping. I agreed.Well she ends up not coming back for 4 hours. During this time the babies woke up. I got them changed, fed, dressed and entertained them. Also the 3 year old blows out her diaper while I'm feeding her. So now i have to get her bathed, changed, and redressed.

&gt;Finally she comes back and we get into it. She admits that she met up with the baby daddy.

&gt;She literally slept with the baby daddy while I was watching her kids."
"Because as much as you *want* to be treated like their male friends, you really actually don't. The dynamic is too different for most women to be comfortable with."
"Honestly it was really fucked up. Was in a LDR with a girl from Canoodia. We were in the shower the morning before I was heading back down to the states and things had been a bit rocky in the relationship up to this point.

So while we're in the shower things start getting a little hot. She leans against the wall and I go to insert and start going soft. Now before we hit Lake Flacid I start trying to jerk muh gurk back to attention but he aint having none of that shit. So she turns around and starts giving me yank and still nada. She starts to get noticeably upset by this, starts tearing up cause my soldier decides to go AWOL. We end up sitting on the floor of the shower with her occasionally reaching over to tingle my dingle and he's still doing his best impression of a boneless bald man.

Eventually she starts bawling ( I mean -real- ugly crying ) but for some fucked up reason I didn't take it seriously. So now we're standing in the shower under the water, her bawling loudly, and every time she wailed I laughed at the same volume, this went on for awhile. 

Yeah I have no fucking idea what happened that day. Shit was weird. We broke up not too long after. "
Five. It was a stressful day for me and my penis

"Wow that's a nice feature. Back when I still had Facebook it would constantly ask if I wanted to be friends with an ex or an ex's new girlfriend. Got old real fast. No, Facebook, I don't want to befriend the girl my ex cheated on me with, even if we do have 11 mutual friends."
"As children, did you show any signs of growing up to be /r/askmen mods?"
"This isn't me, but my husband says that when his ex first gave him a beej, she literally hocked a loogie on his dick, slurped it back into her mouth and then repeated it around his dick until he went soft.  I feel like that story is enough to put me off all types of sex forever."
"A girl that doesn't ""allow"" their boyfriend to masturbate. "
"Hey I'm going to the gym today, wanna come you fat sack of shit or are you gonna couch it again and have your foopa gain another cubic foot from those hot fries? "
"I got horrific food poisoning in a Laotian jungle and I proceeded to shit in my pants and throw up at the same time. It was a horrible experience. Anyway, my SO heroically wiped my shit covered ass crack, legs and shoes whilst I stood there crying. Honestly weeping the manliest of tears. No idea, it happened so fast. Best thing was, she had to leave me alone to go and get some spare clothes and stuff from camp. For five minutes I was stood with my shorts around my ankles in a very eerily quiet jungle, shit everywhere, crying. Oh, plus the horrific smell I conjured up. If anyone stumbled across me then, well..."
I never thought of my piss as sexually attractive.
My mom walked in on me and my first teenage girlfriend dry humping me. The door was open. WTF were we thinking lol
"i dated a girl for a few months who's only plan in life was to string along relationship to relationship until one of them stuck, have kids, and be a stay at home mom. i don't know if that's a ""type"" but it certainly is a characteristic i do not want to be dating ever again."
"I'm very introverted, do not go out often and i can be quiet and reserved around people i do not know very well, or who are very loud and ""present"".         

Unfortunately, though i'm quite comfortable being that way and do not really see it as a problem, it does make me come across as a socially awkward geek or creepy/unpleasant. And women are repulsed by that. "
"Boring answer, but that's almost exactly what I need to pay school taxes for the year. So I'd pay the taxes, which means I would be able to keep the milk cow."

I don't understand why church people feel the need to go rescue kids from 3rd world countries when there is no shortage of kids in their own fucking back yard  that need good homes.
"I don't think he would care that you shave your pubes, he's probably just feeling awkward because he saw his sister naked"
"*Strange story...* I actually learned to masturbate before puberty and so my dick wouldn't exactly feel ""tired"" so to speak since I had no ammo anyways. Well, this one night I had to go to bed but I was bored and curious so I decided to see how many times I could make my penis feel good. So I literally kept going at it, and I swear my Johnson felt like it was in heaven with my non-stop climaxing, I think I had gotten to maybe 30 something by the time I had noticed I was developing some skin irritation and my hand was also about to fall off. I had also unknowingly ended up in an upright position, completely rigid. God, those were the days, endless climaxing.
**TLDR**  I masturbated over 30 times in one night in my glorious prepubescence."
"Honestly my ex put me in a tough situation because she went on and on about how she had no feelings or emotions. And i get it, there are those girls that really do emote very little compared to other girls nowadays. but it got to the point where any issues or anything - her fallback was always some version of ""sorry, i dont have emotions remember?"". And finally the day we broke up came and once again she was on and on about how she doesnt feel a thing and i was upset about the breakup and about everything and i just blurted out ""OH YEAH? THEN WHY THE FUCK DO YOU MOURN YOUR DEAD FATHER? WHY DONT YOU JUST MOVE ON MRS NO EMOTION"". 



I felt terrible........but to this day i think i did kinda make a point there. you have emotions. admit it."
"I don't understand what you intend to talk to her about. The fact that you feel guilty isn't her problem. If you feel bad for hanging out with your friends (which makes no sense), maybe bring her once in a while or do more stuff with her. Badgering her over her lack of friends isn't ""helping"" her. 

Why don't you just take her word that she's fine staying home alone when you go out with your friends? Allot of people actually like having time alone. My wife doesn't have a lot of female friends and she doesn't mind at all if I go out with my male friends. She likes to stay home and work on her hobbies alone or go shopping alone. Not all women are social butterflies. "
"For me it was because I had literally nothing else to offer so I put niceness up on a pedestal like it deserved to be valued higher than what those ""other"" guys had to offer. 

Being nice takes no effort compared to going to the gym, having a good paying job, being interesting/fun to hang out with, etc etc anything that makes someone a desirable partner which I think is a big part of why ""neckbeards"" cling to it. It's something girls say they want which can be provided with zero effort so it's ideal for someone who doesn't do... well anything really, what neckbeards fail to realize is that being nice is nothing, basically everyone looking to get into a relationship is nice to the target of their affection so being nice is moot, the neckbeard is still at zero. 

Also keep in mind that while all women want to be treated nice that means different things to different women. Not every woman wants a white knight so when a neckbeard becomes ""extra nice"" to try and win m'lady's affection it backfires more often than not because most sane people don't want to be deified by their partner.

"
"I've only dated a few girls over many years before getting married, but I'd say ones who aren't that into sex. My first real relationship started off kind of heavy with sexual stuff, but I remember earlier on she said something like ""ugh my last boyfriend was so annoying, he wanted it *all the time*."" Sure enough, after the first few months sex didn't feel like something fun we did, but something she caved to doing after I harassed her enough. "
"I had one of these. Typical Manic Pixie Dreamgirl (MPD) trope that I hooked up with for a semester in college. She was seeing other guys and I couldn't handle it so I iced her out while still pining away for her after she came back from winter break.

No idea what my endgame was as I was hopeless for her, but my only move felt like to cut it off and maybe try again who knows when (I was smoking way too much green back then)

She got in touch with me to let me know she was transferring schools literally on the other side of the country. I wished her well, but I was still really hung up on her. 

We kept in contact sporadically, through pen pal letters, occasional calls, stuff like that. I dated others, had a unplanned daughter with someone else but constantly pined away for her.

I moved to a town far away from my hometown where I knew no one in order to stay close with my then 4 year old daughter. MPD was in a bad place relationship-wise and coming up to a crossroads herself. Calls became more regular, still friendly but more frequent. 

I started dating an intern at work and things were going somewhat well. We were taking it really slowly when Manic Pixie Dreamgirl tells me she was taking a course a few hours drive away from me and wanted to come spend the weekend at my place. 

I told my new girlfriend about our history lied a little about how over her I was and made sure she was OK with the visit. She trusted me and MPD came. We had fun, had a party over at my house where the 2 met and it was a good time. MPD was a little rude to my GF but nothing blatant. 

After everyone left and it was just the two of us, she gave me a hug goodnight and... she was literally throwing herself at me with her vibe and body language, just waiting for me to make a move. 

I had been dreaming about the chance to sleep with her again for the better part of 10 years and now I had finally had the opportunity and I stopped myself. I couldn't do it to my GF. There was many reasons why MPD and me didn't work out and everything was good with GF so why should I fuck it up just to land back where I was pining for MPD again when she left. GF being so trusting made me not want to betray that trust as well.

Anyways- that's my story GF is now my wife and we have had 2 kids in addition to my daughter who just turned 17. I think I was more infatuated with the ""idea"" of the Manic Pixie Dreamgirl than the actual person. Through facebook I can tell MPD got married and had a few kids of her own. We like each others posts but that's about the extent of our contact. 

So yeah, I got her back- but decided she belonged in the past and it was much better that way. "
"I recently met an ""instagram model"" who's also using it to promote her swimwear company (but also does the whole ""get paid to post pics at a resort/nightclub/whatever"") and while yes, it is kinda shallow, she seemed really into it and also enjoyed the business side of things (mostly due to her swimwear company).

I think its definitely very easy to only focus on the shallowness of it and just do it for the attention and money (and I'm sure a lot of these ""models"" are like that) but I think it can be quite interesting if taken seriously as a business.

She also paid for my cocktails though so I may be biased."
"""I think the gap between your daughter and the other children is already growing and is only going to get worse as the year goes on.""

The girl had the abilities of a two year old but was six. The parents asked for my honest opinion and I gave it to them; they looked like I shat in my hand and rubbed it in their face. I got dragged over the coals for that one and it started the downward spiral to me quitting the job soon after. I was right though; the girl did get moved before the end of the year because my replacement (the deputy head) felt it was for the best. "
"Not cuddly enough. Low sex drive. Negative comments about my body, habits, music, lifestyle, clothes and hair. Grumpy in the morning. In other words my last ex."
"GF cowgirl. Reached back to cup my balls and orgasmed at the same time. Clenched her fist and POPPED my balls.  Did you know there's a pain beyond screaming about?

Missed three days of work, could not walk or get out of the chair I dragged myself into. Work was a 4 block walk; left three hours early to make it on time. 6 months and no balls whatsoever, another 6 of one GIANT ball, then three and finally two again. Couldn't wear underwear or walk more than a few blocks w/o pain for 5 years, plus being rendered unconscious occasionally at the point of climax by a migraine.

Now the worst part is she didn't orgasm much at all, was very shy, and the first time she cut loose was catastrophe. Nerfed the ol sex life for quite a while"
"&gt;I know for a fact I'm way closer to him than some of his male friends.

This is the crux of it. He has a level of emotional intimacy with you that he doesn't have with his male friends. This is the same for me and all my female friends, even though I don't want to be romantically involved with them. I get a different kind of thing from most of my female friends than my male friends, and I'm not entirely the same person when I'm with one, the other or together. So it's possible that his ""all my friends together mode"" seems distant for you because you're used to closeness, whereas perhaps he's just trying to strike a balance between the dynamic he usually has with his male friends and that which he has with you. It doesn't mean he cares for you any less, just that he's in a different mode when he's with a mixed group and it's not what you expect.

That's just my theory anyway, it may not be the case."
My dad had untreated depression. He found out my mum was cheating on him and got demoted at work. That did it :/

"Yeah. It's a mix of control and insecurity. Worst part is when she will say something to the effect of ""Why do you need to when you have me?"" And then proceed to turn you down for sex"
Hormones so you weren't. 
"Not me, but a friend.

""Can't you....just make a new one?""

Said to a friend whose infant had died unexpectedly 2 days before."
"As long as you're not squeezing them like your juicing a lemon or sucking on them like your trying to get milk from a tit, you should be fine.  "
"You are VERY lucky to have your current girlfriend. 

Sorry for your loss. "
"Whoa, I go on dates with myself?"
"Immense pressure from society to be something unrealistic. Stereotypes that negatively depict men. A society where men are expected to be fiercely independent has caused a bunch of lonley men. Somehow in the dating world women get to be a lot more picky than men. Extremist feminists making main stream calling all men animals. The past generation(s) taught the young women how to take care of themselves, and the young men were taught to find a wife to take care of them. But that's not really how most women are anymore in large
 So you have a lot of confused young men and strong capable women. Take your pick. I'm not saying men have it worse than women I'm just saying it's a fucked world where women are empowered and men are held to all sorts of weird and dsted standards and looked at like we're animals. 

And.... it could be none of those things. We're all unique individuals. You put two men in the same situation and one might excel where the other would have problems. And just because the first didn't have problems doesn't mean the seconds problems aren't valid. Though that's not how the world sees it and I think that's a large part of the problem."
"I don't like fat people who complain about being fat. Really anyone who, outside of a medical condition, is overweight. I don't hate them, but don't talk health with me."
damn dude
"I used to do this at my old gym, for 1 reason. The showers were absolutely disgusting. 

Imagine a box, 6 shower heads on each side, now imagine hair, nails, and other foul shit men who have no consideration for others all scattered around the shower room, with them all congregating in the middle where the drain was. 

I used to jog home, so I didn't ruin anyone's day on public transport. "

"How about one with a boyfriend?

We tried going from a massage with chilling peppermint oil to anal...

I don't know who had it worse. "
"Not sure yet. I can probably figure out using statistics though: I'll just need to randomly select a relatively small sample of around 1024 guys that representatively fit my demographics (Age, height, race and so on) and get their first hand experience so I can know what having sex with your mom is like"
"""I AM APPROACHING YOU PLEASE DO NOT BE ALARMED"""
"I was out at my local bar with this friend of mine, who kept buying drinks for everyone and insisted that I joined in. I don't normally drink, but I was too spineless to say no at the time, so about four drinks in I started talking to this girl and managed to produce this little nugget: ""Your skin is so nice and soft, it would make a very nice lamp shade.""

I have *no* fucking idea where that came from, but it provided me with a nice excuse to never, ever drink again. And needless to say, the girl practically ran out of there."
"If I've irritated you in some way the last place I want to hear about that is a passive-aggressive Facebook post.

"Don't stop. It's ok to go slow, its ok to fall down as long as you get back up, its ok to fail as long as you keep trying. 

But it's not ok to stop and give up. 

The world is full of people who gave up and more who never even tried. Don't be one of them. "
"My SO and I both like dirty stuff in public. I think it stems from the fact that we are both very unimposing and appear innocent. Nobody would ever think that these two quiet, shy people would be having sex in a movie theater.  And when nobody expects that you would do such lewd things in public, it makes it all the more thrilling when you do."
3 is my upper limit. It feels distinctly empty  after the third time though. 
"I'd say it's typically a bad idea to over-generalize, but I'd say it's safe to say the majority of straight men in the western world look at porn/erotica of some sort.

I think your desire for a little discretion is reasonable. Let him look at porn, but show him how to open an incognito browser window. I think hoping for a guy who only jerks off to images in his head may be a little fantastic. Porn is just too easy to access to expect someone not to access it."
"I lost my husband 12 years ago and only just recently have found a wonderful man. My husband is ALWAYS in my mind body and soul and not going anywhere. Ever. People still exist after death, the body disappeared but not him. Loving him has not affected my ability to love my new partner any less. I'm a lucky one!"
"Not me, but my dad managed to win back my mom after five years through sheer luck. He dated my mom for awhile but he had a shitty home life and didn't want to tell her about it. He was snippy and needed a lot of space so my mom broke up with him. After that, my mom dated another guy for four years. He was awful to her and really made her appreciate what she had with my dad, but he had moved and got a new number so she couldn't contact him. She tried calling his old home phone, but when she asked if he still lived there, the person on the other line said no. Turns out the woman was his grandmother who was about to say he didn't live there because he moved, but my mom hung up before she could finish. Five years after they had broken up, my moms friend took her to a club. Her friend pointed out a guy that she thought was cute and my mom turned around, she saw my dad. She ran up to him and he was so excited to see her that he picked her up and spun her around. His friend told my mom that my dad had been talking about her for five years and had always kept her picture, but her number had changed and he couldn't reach her. They reconnected, he explained why he acted like a jerk, never did it again and they've been married for 21 years! "
You should know that there's actually nothing dangerous about swimming right after eating; that's just a way to try to avoid kids puking in the pool.
"There's a new update where you physically interact with women outside. 

I think it's a gimmick."
Not being friends with someone is actually really easy. You just ignore them. 
"Take him on activites. 

I never had a dad, he was around but it was just awkward, I didn't see him that much. 

Honestly, just be around, just be there, play some ball. But don't force anything, just try to hang around, eventually he'll get comfortable around you. It's your son for god's sake."
"Back in school this guy came into class one day wearing fluffy purple socks. His mum had been paralysed from the waist down a year ago, meaning she had to use a wheelchair. Anyway, we tease him about the socks a bit before someone asks why he's wearing them. 

""Oh, my mum got them for me at *[clothing store]*""

To which I replied, ""That explains it, the mens section is upstairs"".

Tried to pass it off as banter but he never spoke to me again. Feel terrible to this day about it."
"*Everyone* should have access to assisted suicide. I don't care if you're terminal or just suicidal. Mandate them to do therapy before it happens, sure. But everyone has the right to die. It's fucked up how we force people to miserably live institutionalized. Let them go in a way that isn't terrible. Gives them what they want, puts less people on this earth, doesn't leave a disgusting scene of blood, brain matter, or whatever. It doesn't seem like it, but it's more humane to allow physician assisted suicide. "
I suspect my interest in BDSM and extremely rough sex may stem from my abusive childhood but I don't care enough to hire a therapist and find out.
You gotta bang a guy so he thinks you're gay.
"Honestly if you don't think about it from a woman standpoint, but from a quality of life stand point, his life is still garbage.  "" you work at a grocery store, you drive a 06 toyota camry, you dont really have any hobbies or passions, you dont know anything about politics, sports, or anything"" applies to ALL of his life, not just women. So he should change to have a better life over all, not just do it to attract girls. Right now, there isn't much of ""him"" to like. Maybe he has a killer character, that could improve things for him but honestly he sounds a bit like a deadbeat (no offense to your mate) and no girl really wants to date one."

"Illness.

Actual. Mental. Illness. Treatable too. Not very well, admittedly but at least we have pills that can help.

And I think the reason the illness starts, grows or whatever is that we've lost our place in society. For the last million years or so men went out and threw spears at things. We also worked together to make things for the community, and for our families, for whom we provided protection. None of this happens any more. Work is increasingly about office politics, which is frustrated people squabbling over nothing. At the end of the day we (may) have nothing to show for it except the certain knowledge that another pile of paperwork will get done. You can't work extra hard to make it better, or finish it sooner, and nobody is going to come up to you round that fire that evening and say ""y'know, *thanks* man - my fam really needed that paperwork, we appreciate you"".

Nobody needs us any more, are we really surprised that this is what happens?"
"I like being degraded probably because I had some emotionally damaging relationships in the past which I developed abandonment anxiety and low self-esteem from. Pretty hot, right?"

"Damn, player. I can't come close to that. I was going to launch into a story, but now I'll just summarize my fuckup, because I'm in awe of what you went through. You fucking stud.



Mine? In college, me and the lady were getting far too stoned with her (admittedly) attractive roommate. Cue me joking that they should make out and them doing it. Cue my girlfriend, in all her stoned glory, requesting that her friend get me off while my girl watches.


Fantastic right? Wrong. I asked her if she really wanted me to do that. She said yes. I let her friend go down on me and then ride me, never getting up from the couch I was seated on.


Almost immediately after, my SO was weird about it. It turns out we were all just really really really high and it's something she later decided was an awful decision to suggest to me. We went through some really tumultuous times after that.



Still together though... probably the only reason I regret it. I feel like I should have known her better."
"My wife regularly takes the piss out of me because I have a thing for women wearing mohair woollen pullovers/jumpers/cardigans 😂.

We worked out recently that it's a fixation from my childhood where the women I liked in movies wore them I.E Booth from Teen Wolf lmfao.

My wife recently bought one for a trip we took, and I was all over her. It's weird how small, seemingly insignificant things like this can drive us crazy with lust.

Woolly Jumpers 😂"
"Don't do the ""ooh is she your girlfriend"" whenever you bring up a female friend.

"Are you a man or a woman? I guess it doesn't matter too much. You don't win real friends by ingratiating yourself and sucking up to them. It's better to conduct yourself in an admirable way, so that people feel energised and uplifted by your presence. If you're in the workplace, focus on doing what you can to be productive, and to assist the productivity of those around you when it seems necessary. Be reliable, be a source of stability, treat people like they matter - which usually just means listening to them.

If he thinks you're the type of person he wants to associate with, he'll come to you sooner or later and so will other people."

"In college I asked a girl out, she said yes but she was busy that weekend. I tried to reschedule the next friday and the next saturday. After so many ""I'm busy now how bout later?"" I just told her that the ball was in her court.

That was 100% leading me on. I liked her, she seemed to like me. She was super flirty even when cancelling and 'rescheduling'. Just made me feel like crap."
"I have a gay friend who is usually hard to really get to (as in, hurt his feelings or offend) and I said something like ""do you think gay guys like those thin, skeleton looking twinks because it reminds them of AIDS victims?""

He still messages me asking how dog dick is.

"It was a tinder girl who was really trashy and slutty. It had been a while for me so i decided fuck it. When i got there she was smoking something that wasnt weed or tobacco, way bigger than i thought, and kind of just not all there in the head. I still went through with it but when it was all said and done i felt more gross than ever and didn't really have a sex drive for a couple months. That was when i decided im never having sex with someone im not attracted to which is a lesson i thought i would never have to learn. "

"Watching/making women orgasm.

It probably started with my first real girlfriend when I was 17. She had never had an orgasm but though she had we were slow dancing and I started fingering her, she orgasmed and her knees buckled and she clung to.me whimpering.

After that I tried to make her cum all the time and I was obsessed with female orgasms. One girlfriend between my hands, mouth, piv and vibrator I would make her count her orgasms out loud until she could no longer tell me how many she'd had. There were times she would beg me for no more.

"I'm extremely strong-willed and stubborn. I guess that explains both the ""what"" and the ""why."""
I work 12 hour shifts and literally every single day this shit happens. I get off work head to my car say bye to my coworkers. Turn on some music to pump me tf up because I'm finally off and I'm feeling good. Start driving I feel amazing I'm thinking about all the shit I'm gonna get done when I get home like working out or studying then boom I get home instantly tired and I pass out and wake up at 3am with that shitty nap feeling. 
"I was having suicidal thoughts about a year ago, I still do sometimes but it's nowhere near as bad as it was. For me it was about the pressure. I felt like I had to be something I didn't want to be, so I forced myself through a situation where I was miserable to fit in to what my family/friends expected of me. I couldn't stand the thought of letting those people down.

I'm in a better situation now all because of communication. Fortunately my parents are very compassionate people who just want me doing what I feel I can do best and be happy doing, so that helped a lot, but being able to talk to them was pretty difficult."
"It's one of those things that varies for everyone. I'm not /u/notunhinged, so I won't speak for them, but I am a very touch-oriented person. In terms of the five love languages, ""physical contact"" is right up there, several lengths ahead of the rest.

In my subconscious mind, being around someone consistently is evidence that you like being around them, but being in physical contact with them is as near as possible to get to definitive proof. That contact says ""I'm not just sharing your space, I'm here because you matter to me."" When we're together, I will maintain very regular physical contact with my girlfriend. Rubbing her leg with my foot under the table, holding her hand, brushing across the small of her back as I walk past her in the kitchen, hugs, cuddles on the sofa, anything. She is intoxicating, I can't get enough of her, and touch is the way I show that.

Other people don't like to be touched. Sometimes it's due to a traumatic experience in their past, sometimes it's just a desire for personal space. That's totally fine, but it would crush me if she recoiled from my attempt to hold hands or to hug her from behind while she chops vegetables. I would have a lot of trouble in that relationship.

Again, though, it's different for everyone."

"The comfortable ones. 

You know you meet some people and you just feel the need to be guarded around them? 

And then there are other people where, even if you've just met, you're so much more willing to be open with them than with others? Like, you feel as though you can be yourself and they won't judge you? 

They're a tough kind to find but they save worry, time, and they're usually just great to be around. The kind of girl where you can just say that stupid thought you just had (""do you think dogs have a favorite type of poop or puke to eat, like solid poos or white ones?"") and even if you get a ""What the fuck?"" look you know she'll move past it. "
Go in for the kiss during that awkward moment of silence.
"We had this problem briefly. I said ""Fine, I'll stop masturbating if I get any kind of sex from you any time I want."" She agreed. It didn't take but a couple of weeks for her to regret that decision.

She didn't understand masturbation isn't always about sex. Sometimes it's to help you sleep. Sometimes you have a stressful day ahead at work &amp; it's been a few days since you've had sex, so you want to get it out of your system so you can focus on your day. Hell... There are hundreds of reasons to masturbate, and it's not until a woman tries to be your masturbation replacement that she realizes the why you need to masturbate.

Hell, in my case, if I masturbate less, my overall sex drive drops."
"Put my ear to the door and furiously masturbate whilst yelling the roommates name. No, wtf do normal humans do, ignore it jeez."

"My dad walked in on a similar situation when I was 16. Bless his heart, we didn't notice he walked in so he slowly backed out and came more noisily up the stairs, giving me the chance to dash into my closet and put my shirt back on.

Later that evening he pulled me aside and let me know that he had walked in...mostly for the sake of warning me to be more careful, ""god forbid your mother should come in next time.""

For such an uptight dad he had his chill moments."

"My dad had nearly this exact same scenario. Got let go in a layoff. Wife cheated. Killed himself the day before the house sold/closed and before the divorce. 

He saw the layoff coming, so was working at the grocery store part-time to make ends meet. Mom did not seek work but sought a better ""provider"" at her weekly dance. Funny, the dude worked at the same company but was unaffected by the layoff. Now he controls all my dad's assets, because mom is a good Christian housewife. His kids will inherit everything. Meanwhile she made her own kids side against him. 

My takeaway... there are a lot of people out there who see men as provider robots. Goodwill towards these robots end the day they suffer a set back. "

"Once when I was very young, probably about 7 or so, I was playing go fish with my mother. We'd played a few matches before and we were tied, and I was really getting excited and into this intense final match, when I said something about how I was going to win. My mother said ""It's not over until the fat lady sings!"" Now, my mother had always had body image issues, and wasn't the most healthy person around, but my young mind decided saying ""Then sing, mama, sing!"" Needless to say, she was very upset and crying. I'll never forget that moment, though she likely has, and I'll always feel bad about it."

Fuck these losers. They need to be separated from ones who enjoy the medium but don't want to be associated with that subculture.

"When we were dating for a year and not living together yet, I went to a party near my GF's house. When the party was over, I was feeling pretty sick, so I went to her instead. When I got to her, I puked all over one of the bathrooms, and when she started cleaning it up without a word, I went to puke all over the other  bathroom and she cleaned that up as well. Not my proudest moment, but I knew she was a keeper."

"Because men have no purpose anymore.

Women, as of about 1960 or so, were free to pursue any identity she wanted. Housewife? Sure. Martha Stewart made a killing being a very professional one. CEO? Go get them girl.

As for men? Their choices were really, disposable provider, disposable provider, or disposable provider.

The flip side of boys being encouraged to DO things is that it's what their entire self esteem becomes based on. 

What women will never ever ever ever understand is that their constant evaluation of men in terms of ""what are you doing for me right now/what can you do for me right now"" has a huge emotional cost. It means that as soon as the guy loses his job, he has no value to society at all. If it's an urban guy who can pick up another job, no problem. But the plant closing in the rust belt? That means he's lost his wife, house, and is probably unemployable, meaning he is literally of ZERO value to society.

"I grew up in a *very* conservative culture. (Like if girls wore makeup or wore *just* a Tshirt and jeans she was ""promiscuous"".)

This was a common thing. That all women were expected to just find a man and make babies. It was what I now know is, ""toxic femininity"", and it rarely if ever created healthy relationships.

Because as soon as she got married and had kids at 20, she realized she'd never went on that adventure, never wrote that book, never did what she truly wanted to do.

Then *it's too late.* She's stuck in a marriage taking care of kids she'd had too early, married to a man who's still growing up, and in (likely) a small community that doesn't have much to do outside of going to church on Sunday.

Having kids isn't terrible, but it's not for everyone, and *at least* everyone should find themselves and go on an adventure before settling down."

We arrive to the house and my aunt with her new man are in the driveway welcoming the guests while the older women are doting on the infant inside. The man introduces himself to my mom and I, she says hello and then he goes to shake my hand. I refused to extend my hand and said ""your hand is dirty so we can't shake hands"". 

He was black, and also the first black man I'd met.

The look on my mother's face was of shock and horror, stacked with a few generations of white guilt on top. He bursted into laughter at the ridiculousness of my comment, and I imagine to also ease my entire family's embarrassment. 30 years later he and I still get a good laugh from retelling the story."

And they got to do it within a week.  Ukrainian adoption agencies are apparently a bit more sketchy than US though, because they told them they had a baby that needed a home, and they wanted a baby.  My cousin's wife was unsuccessful in getting pregnant so they wanted the whole baby experience.  They get there and meet the baby, and the baby's 4 siblings.  The agency was going to give my cousin just the baby and split the family up, and this was no big deal to them.

And so she's held back. And as that time gets longer and longer the parents have time to come to grips with the severity of her deficiency. "

"This. 

I go on an annual ski trip each year and its usually a guys only trip, but one year the wives and girlfriends joined and it was kind of a disaster. 

Men and women joke with each other in very different ways. The women were getting all upset because they thought we were being ""mean and cruel"" to each other when in reality its just how we joke around.

There was also one girl there who was convinced her boyfriend was bi due to the over the top homoeroticism that arises when a group of men get together. 

Then there's the pranks. Pranks are part of the ski trips and everyone is on the lookout for an opportunity to pull one. Two of the women would always find ways to interrupt them because they took it as ""being mean"". 

Needless to say it went back to a guys trip only. "

"To add to this: /u/movingthroughspectra

- Don't turtle up. Find some good friends, of any sort, so long as they are trustworthy, 100% reliable, OR find some random chat website like blahtherapy.com and just talk. Say everything, all the details, get it out of your system. I did this and felt better after a while. Talking to the bros &gt; talking to internet strangers, because you don't have to start at square 1 every time, but it's good to have the option.

"I've seen women treated as equals among ""bros"" but it takes time and a special type of personality.  Usually it's on a construction/trade crew where they are the only woman.  

The key is to never play the girl card.  If you ever say ""As a woman"" or expect a guy to ""be a gentleman"" then you're telling us that you'd prefer to be treated as a girl instead of an equal.  

Guys are always testing each other.  If you're in a testosterone fueled group and not getting made fun of something's not right.  You're either not liked or not part of the group (girl).  

So, if your friends have taken shots across the bow and you took offense instead of firing back, you've again shown that you'd prefer to be treated as a girl instead of one of the guys.  

That or one of the guys in the group has taken a liking to you and sees you as potentially more than a friend. "
"I was going out with a girl and we were parting ways. There was a vague plan to reconnect, but I kinda knew I would be breaking up with her. 

I was about to leave for the airport and we made out a little, then I nudged her head down and she gave me a bj. I felt kinda bad because it was one-sided and because maybe accepting her doing that gave her hope of the relationship continuing. "
Needy. Always wanting attention.

"Thats what made me so sad. Before she became Instagram famous, she was just a lovable, good-looking, smart girl who wasnt ashamed if she burped or farted in front of me. After her instagram took off, it was all about makeup, looking and appearing good and happy, eventhough we were not happy anymore. We went to a lot of parties and she only (very carefully) gave me a small peck on the lips for photos. No kissing in public at all, because I couldve ruined her makeup.

Stuff like that. We were still KINDA normal at home, but besides that? Nah..


Its a career ... for now. But beauty fades, and so will her income stream.

"It's OK to question trans folks considering hormone therapy and surgical conversion, and ask them to seek a heavy amount of counseling before pulling the trigger. 

For the record, I have met people that were genuinely suffering from body dysmorphia as far as I could tell.  Before making even starting hormones and making change they lived their life as a woman and spent years exploring their 'true self' before seeking medical assistance.  I still don't understand why, but understand that I never will, and can accept their choices.  

The reason I can't support trans folks without question though is because of Kim.  She started working at my small company as a draftsman, and was the most mannish woman I'd ever met.  She wore velcro tennis shoes, had the strong and rough hands of a tradesman, and her fashion choices were always practical first, fashion dead last.  Talking with her, things virtually every girl knows was just a void.  Almost like she was raised without any feminine influences.  All easily explained, but once the idea of ""she's a dude"" crossed my mind a ton of other stuff started making sense.  

Fast forward awhile and we came to find out that Kim used to be Tim.  His wife had died tragically, and the guy just lost it.  Apparently she was taken too soon, and wished it was him instead of her.  So, the logical solution to this was to *replace* his wife in the world, start wearing her clothes and dress as start making the conversion to become a woman, so ""Tim"" could die, and ""Kim"" could live.  

Since she was now trans, to question the reasons for transition becomes extremely taboo, but this is a person who I feel needs genuine mental help.  "

"Coming from the opposite side here: I'm a woman and I noticed the sex start to decrease around 6-8 months in, or after ""the honeymoon period"" so to speak.  I'm the one with the higher sex drive and always have been so I started getting myself off more than having sex from... basically the beginning. Since there's so much more to our relationship that sex, and the sex we do have is dope as fuck, I have no problem with that. 

Just like giving my two cents since the idea that men have to always sex hungry animals 24/7 is still very pervasive, and in my opinion, it's a harmful stereotype. It's not just women who deny their partners.

"Within a week of moving in with my gf we had lots of sex. 8-9 times a day type thing. Some days we didnt even bother getting out of bed. 

Anyways one time, 2nd or 3rd time of the day I was on her left, she was on her back, my left leg was over her right leg but under her left leg. We were going at it and she started to orgasm hard. Really hard. So hard that in clenching her left leg down on my leg there was a kind of ripping sensation then  agony.

"Alright I've got one. 

Was having sex with my ex before a lil Wayne concert, different times. 

She has an IUD so smooth sailing always. Highly recommend. Until this happened. 

So we're in doggie and there's a pretty aggressive degree of pounding taking place. She loved anything rough so I'm choking her, which from behind is an interesting angle, and to this day I don't know exactly what happened but the underside of my wanghead got caught on her copper IUD wire and just tore into me. Due to the aggressive nature of the sex stuff it felt ..uncomfortable.. but not terrible so I kept on keepin on. Until I looked down and there was blood everywhere, like sheets, bodies, my pillows, just a crime scene. 

Stopped and told her that she's bleeding and she told me to keep going. Obliged of course, because sex. Finished and popped out eventually to see it was me doing the bleeding. Oddly not in pain but so much blood. 

It honestly looked like I hit a deer with my car in my bed. We laughed about it, I don't have a scar, and she got the wires trimmed.  

Still see her sometimes, great girl. "
"I can only say what my circumstances are, but; Being enemployed or a job seeker and feeling as though even once you do have employment you are still incredibly easy to replace, so you have to somehow develop a thick skin emotionally, especially if someone decides you're their punchingbag at work.  
  
Feeling as though you have to achieve incredible things to be seen as successful. Just surviving on what you can and what support you can find is bottom-level achieveing even though it's incredibly difficult.  
  
Feeling lonely and helpless/supportless. Sometimes you feel like grabbing someone and saying ""I AM NOT OKAY IN THE SLIGHTEST PLEASE HELP ME"" but that would be a huge breach of the 'weak men need help/cry' rule.  
  
These are just a couple of things I feel as an unemployed man. I begged my employment service provider to get me a meeting with someone who could assess my ability to look for work, keep work and just generally live in such a way that would lead to employment. It was always 'Just stick with it, you'll be fine.' etc. I genuinely felt like a piece of meat they wanted to make money from and they would care in the slightest if I had a breakdown or worse. 
  
While required to volunteer as I was on benefits, I would spend my 30 minute break waiting at the welfare office for the chance for an appointment with the assessor. I did this every day I 'worked', just asked ro see the assessor politely and sat quietly waiting until my 30 minutes were almost up then headed back to the store I volunteered at.  
  
Every second Wednesday I'd recieve the benefit, feel like I didn't deserve a cent of it and get absolutely wasted on Burbon. Id take a few gulps straight and wash it down with soft drink, then when I was good and munted I'd take a few more gulps for good measure to ensure I'd sleep. Usually a half a bottle of burbon a 'session'. This went on for weeks, until I started having way more anxiety than usual so I decided to go to the doctor to see if He'd write me a note for a couple of days off of volunteering (I wanted to go home a get drunk and sleep), if I didn't provide a doctors not I'd lose a part of the benefit amount for not turning up to volunteer. So I went, the doctor saw I wasn't doing too great and printed a note out. I went back to the volunteer store, let them know then walked over to the welfare office to give them a copy of the note.  
  
I waited for a while and got called over to a persons desk. I told her I was handing in a doctor's not and she immediately said ""That's not a valid note."" And looked at me like I had an answer for her statement. Another person came over and looked me up on the computer and asked why I needed days off, I told her I was having some trouble in general. I also told her I'd been asking to see the assessor for some time and politely asked if I'd be able to do that today, I told them I could wait all day. They asked me to take a seat in the waiting area but it probably wouldn't happen since the assessor was very busy. I offered to go and get a 'valid' letter from the doctor but they said I should just wait in the waiting area.  
  
So I did. Panicking I was going to be cut off from the benefit for providing a somehow wrong note from the doctor, worrying about what I'd do once that (surely) happened. Wondered how I'd pay my mother rent money and pitch in for food as best I could. Worry about feeling somehow worse than ever before and if I should just take myself out of the equation. I started planning it, taking a bus to somewhere very remote, digging a shallow hole, rolling myself up in garbage bags and suffocating in a hole, you know, to help everyone be free of my burdening them. To my few friends and family I'd seem like I'd just disappeared. To everyone else, they were free of having to deal with me, help me, look at me.  
  
All that rumination took place over about 3 minutes but I was interrupted by a person who looked to be in her late 40s, taller than me, dark frizzy hair, tribal-looking earring dangly things on big hoops and wearing a dress that looked like an orange monk's outfit, but a dress you'd see at a boutique. She asked me in to her office and closed the door behind me. We sat across from each other at her (really clean, save for a tissuebox) desk. I thought I was in a world of trouble somehow so I shut the fuck up and waited for her to talk.  
  
She introduced herself as the assessor and her job was to make sure people were able to fullfil their obligations in order to recieve a benefit. She asked me what was going on and wrote down some of what I said. She asked me questions like ""How long for?"" And ""When do you think this started?"", like really listening with open ended questions. I told her how I'd lost almost half my bodyweight when I was 21 and working in an environment where people hated me and I didn't know why. I told her about how every person who'd treated me loke shit was an older man and how I was now terrified of any older men. I told her my hobbies, how often I took part in them and what my sleep schedule was like.  
  
After this she said, and I'll never forget because her voice went from calm and inquisitive to fucking serious, ""[My name], you're not well... Here's what we're going to do. How does 3 months of no obligations whatsoever sound?"" And I froze, like not stumped for what to say but just froze completely. I remember looking down at my hands in my lap and I just became overcome with relief and emotion. I teared up and the first fucking thing I said was ""I'm sorry."" And asked if it was okay to take a tissue. She said ""You don't have to keep on living like this. The system you're in isn't built with mental health in mind..."" then she went on to say how she hated the current system and how it destroys people like me and how she sees the same issues and behaviours in men all the time. I couldn't get anything other than ""thank you"" out with my eyes on the verge of floating to the top of my skull from tears filling em.  
  
She let me sit there in silence while she did some computering. When I'd regained a little conposure we ended our meeting. I felt free for the first time in 9 years. No leash around me neck being pulled one way or another.  
  
That's the story of the day where I was either going to disppear and kill myself of get help.
  
I'm sorry for such a long-winded thing. It means a lot to me that someone out there might not gove up on finding help. My father killed himself when I was around a year old. I never knew him, but I am always kind of angry he did what he did, not because I think he was selfish, but because if he'd had access to help for whatever the fuck was going on with them then maybe our family would have been a bit better off.

That might sound shitty and something r/iamverysmart worthy, but I constantly notice that most of people my age that I meet (early 20s), I listen to just to be polite and not because I'm interested in what they have to say. "
To some degree you need to respect that there relationship has boundaries and that her spending a certain level of time alone with another single dude could be problematic.  You could try to ensure that a chunk of the time that you spend with her is in group activities where the husband is there or invited. In fact becoming his friend is probably the easiest thing you could do to ease his mind. It might help is she could work into conversations with her husband how completely undateable/unattractive she finds you. Beyond that just making sure you don't hang out/talk to a weird degree.

"Not to be rude this is a pessimistic answer. Relationships take work and effort. If you're asking this question it means you're willing to put in the work to fix the issues but you want to know if there's still a chance to fix these issues.

"There is a strong thread in American masculinity- and a lot of other cultures- that men must be entirely self-sufficient. This includes emotional self-sufficiency. It is this perception that leads to men feeling emasculated when asked to share their feelings and insecurities. 

This has lots of effects. Men are less likely to be willing to engage in mental health care (and all other healthcare). They are less willing to open up about their problems to their friends. They are more likely to isolate when injured, mentally or physically, and more likely to choose death over change. 

"
"This.  The emotional connection is different, in almost every way.  Even non-romantically, we communicate with, interact with our female friends differently than our male ones.  We can sit for hours with our male friends and not say a word, watching sports or something like that.  We don't ""share"" the same with our male friends.

Most of the women I know consider the type of friendship men have with each other as neglectful if it's applied to them.  I've not spoken to my best friend in 3 days, and it's no big deal.  I'll talk to him in 2-3 days from now and it will be as if we never missed a beat.  He may ask me what went on, or he may not, it's no big deal.  Men just connect differently with each other and have different expectations."

"A lot of people falsely assume that people who commit suicide do so due to mental illness but many do it out of sheer and utter hopelessness. Losing a job and being unable to get back on your feet, divorce, losing your children are all reasons men have committed suicide."

Transgender is a mental disorder. You can't pick gender. You can choose to be something else. Your mind is broken and fucked up and we can't and shouldn't be humoring them. There's tons of people who think they're Jesus they're still wrong.

I've got some bad news for you buddy...
You're better off without it tbh. Might suck right now but later on when everyone is still spending all their money binge drinking every weekend you'll be able to function like an adult.

"&gt;While hitting up online dating the day after a breakup seems to be the MO of a lot of people, I'd argue that you should avoid tinder and OKcupid until you've had at least a couple months to work through this

This.  Had a match on Tinder tell me ""you sound like you need more time, and I don't wanna be someone's rebound"".

[Edit] She also said ""People who get out of relationships and start dating really quickly tend to not know what they want, and that means the other person just ends up getting hurt the majority of the time""

I asked her if 2 months was too soon to start dating again, she said ""no, it's all on you at the end of the day, but what you're saying is making it obvious that you're actually not okay, you're still hung up a bit, and you need a little more time.""

I've now confessed to myself that I went to Tinder because I was lonely and wanted SOMEONE.  Validation, even worse.  

If you're doing it to feel wanted, I'd say that's a rebound.  You just want to be with and fuck someone because you miss having that suddenly, and you make a knee-jerk decision.

Time.  Time will heal.

Also, get away from her as much as you can.  It's gonna suck.  You're gonna feel more alone than ever before, but time will heal you.  It's cliched, but it's one of the rare cliches that actually DOES work.

Also, cry.  Cry like a baby.  Get it out.  It's completely, GENUINELY okay.  I felt like such a baby, but everyone will sympathize.  Even work colleagues.  Ride the waves, let yourself be upset and don't fight it.  Some days you'll feel amazing, one day you'll feel great, on the way to work, a song will come on and it will drag you kicking and screaming back in to your tears again as you wipe them away trying to stay on the road at the same time.  LET. IT. HAPPEN.

Watch romance movies.  How To Be Single, Friends With Benefits, romcoms helped me.  

Don't fight your feelings. Just let them out.  I was a wreck for about 2 weeks.  Now I have the odd twinge of sadness here and there 3 months later, but I'm doing far better."
"Not sure if this counts...
We dated in 2008, for a few months, broke up because of me, I regretted my decision, but we stayed close friends.
I chased her for years, bending over backwards for her in an attempt to prove my worth, making it known that I'll always be there. By 2017... I told her I was done, and planned to move one and that wouldn't change our friendship. 
Within a week of me telling her, she told me she had done some thinking and wanted to be with me. I looked her in the eye, despite thinking this is all I wanted for the better half of a decade, I said no.

"What is going on? It's a vague request for advice. But... The idea is that only a few things in life really matter. Your health, meaningful personal relationships, and your happiness. None of these things have anything to do with money, girlfriends, social status, etc. In fact, it's not until we lose everything that we can get the clarity to see what matters to us. 

For me, I've got a couple of examples (In case you're saying easier said than done. I've been there)

1. I was living in Las Vegas in 2005 doing real estate and casino development. I was worth well into the 8 figure range at 25 years old. In 2007 the market imploded and I basically lost 25 million dollars (on paper) in about three days. I went from being on top of the world to living on a friends sofa out in oceanside california in under a week. What a week that was lol. 

2. Two years ago I was diagnosed with cancer. My fiancee and love of my life for six years left me when she found out I had cancer. I eventually beat it after experiencing hell on earth. I met a new girl when I was traveling in europe. We fell in love and got engaged, then I got cancer again my house flooded and I was having a lot of trouble at work. My second fiancee left me in october. I beat cancer again. Currently I'm nomadic 10 months later with a gutted house and a lot of lawsuits that will drag on forever. They just found a benign (fingers crossed) tumor in my chest. 

My advice is to focus on the positive things in my life and improve what I have the ability of improving. Always have to fight and push and keep going in a positive direction. Try to distract yourself from the really negative stuff by traveling and having fun with friends. I just tell myself to keep moving forward and spend as much time as possible with people I care about. I've met another wonderful woman who keeps me smiling and I have great, supportive friends and a cool brewery to hang out at, so life could be worse.

"Hey, it takes all kinds.

My SO is independent, has her own life, and is friends with lots of dudes, including a few exes.

A lot of guys would balk, but that's part of her appeal to me - she does her own thing and is mature enough to have mixed gender friendships and is alright with the fact that I have them.

It's all about compatibility. I don't like dainty, helpless women...but some guys do!"

"A very, very common mistake that many men make (especially those who struggle in the dating world) is thinking that getting a GF is going to magically fix all of their problems.  It doesn't (I know from experience).

Getting a GF is a downright euphoric feeling for the first few months (ie. the honeymoon period), but as that begins to wane, it essentially becomes your norm, and you're back to your baseline.

So even if he changes nothing and gets a GF, he's still going to be scrawny, in a dead-end job, driving a crappy car, with no interests or hobbies.  He's still going to be the same person, he's just the same person who happens to have a GF (and let's be honest here: based on your description, I'm guessing his theoretical future GF isn't going to be a catch).  

You say he's unhappy without a girl, but to me, it sounds like he's unhappy with himself period, and he thinks that having a GF will somehow validate him and make him feel less unhappy about himself.  That's not what dating and relationships are about."

"Ended things with an Ex of 2 years.

She contracted HSV-2 while we were getting back together, slept with me, blamed me for giving it to her, told her family, emotionally manipulated me to stay with her, then told me she'd commit suicide if we didn't get back together.

Tested negative, cut her out and blocked her from social media and ignored calls.

Told her mother of her contemplating self harm.

Talking to a much nicer, less scarier girl.

I'm so happy and as are my friends who saw this a mile away. Definitely dodged a bullet."
"We had been dating for around two weeks.  One night while cuddling and making out in bed I wanted to say ""I love holding you"" but it came out as ""I love you.""  For a second she looked at me a little shocked but she started to smile and said ""I love you too"" before kissing me and holding me tight.  

Relationship wise we stayed a couple for another nine or ten months."

"I wouldn't say there's much to understand. Men are humans and we want to be treated with basic human decency. Just treat men (and people in general) with respect and don't act like we are another species that needs to be studied.

I think I speak for many men around the world when I say we hate that he-said-she-said gossip bullshit. "

"Several years back, I was dating a girl whom I had developed real feelings for, I was sure things were progressing to something more serious even though they had been fairly static for months. Every time I tried to have a talk with her about it she would give me some nice words but nothing would come of it. 

I thought she felt the same as me but was just nervous or something, until one of our mutual friends had a moral crisis and informed me that the girl in question was only leading me on for my finances/life status, and was also fucking other men on the side. (She had proof of these claims).

I confronted her, and even when faced with the concrete proof of what she said/did, she denied it up and down and swore she was in love with me. I ended it with her. 

Soon after I did this, she told me she was pregnant. I didn't believe her, but sure enough, she was. I spent a few months freaking out about it but I maintained that the baby couldn't be mine (timing didn't add up) and rebuffed all her efforts to get me to ""man up and help with the baby"" with ""only after a DNA test"".

Eventually she let up and left me alone. Baby came out the wrong colour and I breathed a sigh of relief.

That was a hard time, and a valuable lesson. I was young, naive, and crushed. I've never let myself be bamboozled like that since.

"Personally, I find that I can quickly reach a level of emotional intimacy with female friends far quicker than with male friends. I have known some guys for a decade whom I would never discuss my deepest feelings with (because it would make them uncomfortable) whereas there are women I've known for weeks who I can express very personal things to and they to me. There's a spectrum of things I get out of friendships, and in general, most of the women provide more of the emotional support and the men provide the resilience, but there is a lot of overlap too."

"Spend time on yourself.

I tried to commit suicide three times in about 5 months, from November to February. I was at the lowest I have ever been, although I'm only 26. 2016 was a damn shitty year for me and it got to me.

After I survived the attempts, I figured my existence was fucked up and I needed to change it. So I actively engaged in my own life and examined what I needed to do to make a change.

During my depression (I later learned I am Type 2 Bipolar) I lost almost forty pounds. Sounds great (yay weight loss), but most of that weight loss was in two months. Extremely dangerous.

So I took myself to therapy, to a psychiatrist, and stuck with both of them. I changed my diet (I went vegan), started exercising, and loosely watch what I eat. I surrounded myself with my friends.

It took almost a year, but I'm in the best state I've ever been in. I'm still losing weight, which is something I don't want, but I'm gaining muscle. I'm happy and mostly stable (yay medication). I have a pretty good job and am almost fully independent. I spend time and money on myself. It doesn't hurt to be a little introspective and a little selfish if it means your mental health gets better."

"Gentleness. Gentle, soft and affectionate is my bedroom drug.

I know the reasons behind that very well:

1. My body is pretty sensitive, meaning that gentleness tends to feel disproportionally good to me, but also that roughness either drowns out all the really pleasurable sensations and/or becomes uncomfortable.

2. I've spent all my sexually active life with a girl who is similarly sensitive and into gentleness and that tends to really mold you.

3. I'm generally very averse to violence, pain and power dynamics in bed, and gentleness is the opposite of all that.

4. To me, feelings/emotion/affection are inseparably tied into sex, and gentleness transports these best."
