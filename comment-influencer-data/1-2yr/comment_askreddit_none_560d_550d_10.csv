I went to the vet once. The lady didnt look like she knew what she was doing with my cat. I mean she gave a diagnosis and stuff but she couldn't handle the cat and ended up forcefully squeezing him and he yowled and squeezed out of her hands and ran around the office. Usually my cat is super duper duper chill. I was just standing watching her awkwardly because the previous time i went there the lady treating my cat that time was so soft and gentle with my cat I actually felt jealous my cat warmed up to her so quickly. But yeah anyways that lady gave my cat a bunch of things without telling me it'd cost. I specifically came in for a check up and when I got to the front desk i had to pay over $100. I was expecting something like $30 which is what they advertised. Thats why im so reluctant to go to the vet now.. I still would in bad situations but thankfully my cats havent had anything major problems.
You know nothing about me to call me a coward lmao.
"I’ve been doing this for years. If you know how much of what to give, it is the best possible thing. Go look at any breed, compare a raw diet dog to a kibble dog..... they look healthier, they glow, their fur is incredibly softer and cleaner. Their teeth are cleaner and their breath doesn’t smell like asshole. Their shit looks nicer. You can tell they are healthier by the shit alone. Also it’s cured many crazy things in dogs. Especially dogs with skin conditions.

I’m not telling people to just go buy raw meat and give it to your dog. Don’t even listen to google. Look for a local seller that sells raw specifically for dogs. Get supplements like kelp, collagen protein, and tumeric. And mix it with their food. 

Everyone here will thank me when they make the switch. If you do it right you will save tons of money too. Also if your dog shits on the neighbours lawn, it’ll disintegrate  in to the ground, because it’s raw, nice, healthy shit. If it wasn’t it would sit around all gross like a kibble fed dog."
I would like to know how a vet tech like yourself can want to support breeders when approximately 1.5 MILLION pets are being euthanized each year due to overpopulation.

If there's no detriment then why not?
Tea tree oil is actually a tried and tested flea repellent - also an insect repellent that humans can use - but it shouldn't be the only thing used to prevent against fleas. 
You're 100% right. I remember noticing this years ago and almost all the contributing authors are employed by the major pet food makers. Amazing how brainwashed and incapable of independent thinking most vets are when it comes to this topic.

"TBH shooting him in the arm/leg would probably have sufficed to immobilise him, then just the threat of being shot probably would have stopped anything happening until the police arrived.

But I do agree with the sentiment of your comment.

EDIT: serious question, why is this being downvoted? I'm just wondering why the guy was killed when there might have been an alternative that wouldn't have involved years of therapy and possible jail time.

Note: I have no gun experience, and I live in a county where guns are tightly controlled."

"Per my comment, I based this assumption on OP's comment that she had to tell him in advance she was not available.

"Point is, this is not just anecdotal evidence. In terms of relative mobility (getting to higher bracket than your parents/previous generation) the US ranks as high as Sweden, and the UK. Jury is still out on absolute mobility (which compares the likelihood of US children to be better off than EU counterparts) because there has actually never even been a transnational study on the subject. The guy who managed the pew economic mobility project tried to get one going for a while, but it never happened.  "

"Raw meat diets are amazing for some breeds. My GSD has been on a raw chicken diet since he was on solid food. I recommend buying a grinder to grind up the chicken and bones or else you end up with a mess when he decides to drag his food across the floor but a raw, bone in diet will result in a shinier healthier coat, healthier digestive track and keep their teeth very clean and strong. Though it does create massive dogs lol my pup is 110-115lbs of pure muscle at 13.5 months old, ive never seen such a big GSD.



Ps. I will add for anyone interested PM me I can send pictures of his markings and size, he is intact and I plan on studding him once he is of age, both of his parents had certified hips and im willing to get his certified aswell. Only purebreeding German lines, I will NOT further an american showline, they are unhealthy for the overall health of the breed. "

"Hear me out, I'm not being racist, but those who go around trying to be victims based on their color or historical treatment as an ethnic group really need to stop. Like, it happened 60 years ago, and you're just trying to live in the past and take credit for the suffering of other people that are just the same skin color as you. You need to suffer for yourself before you actually cry about racism.

And a secondary opinion, masturbation is as close to being a sin as it gets, but it's less of a violation if you're a man because your genitals stick out of your main body frame; it's meant to be exposed to external factors."
"It makes me so sad that people like you breed. I'm praying for your kids. But not for you, I hope you suffer."
Shake my head my head indeed. Lol
Kinda strange to be downvoted for making a factual statement.  I'm not even one of those people. I just pointed out that they exist.  On the flip side though I'm sure there are tons of people who get their dog fixed but then complain about the treatment of animals on farms

"Source? If you're talking about the hand gesture thing, there was a video of him doing that when talking about several different people (without disabilities). It was his way of poking fun of someone when they are stammering and confused. The fact that nobody batted an eye when he did it to non-disabled people and then made a big deal over him doing it to someone with a (non-mental) disability kind of makes those people look like asses, not Trump. 

We shouldn't make fun of people for their disabilities. We should treat them equally, including poking fun at them the same way we do non-disabled people. 

Edit: Not sure about [this site](https://www.catholics4trump.com/even-more-video-evidence-trump-did-not-mock-reporters-disability/), but it has a bunch of videos showing him doing the same thing for years, mocking even himself with the same exact motions. "
