I had one regular who was married. His wife traveled once a month for work and she'd be gone about 4 days. He just called when she wasn't home and talked about her and their life together for 2 hours. Never once was there sexy talk. He just missed his wife and didn't want to annoy his friends by talking about her so he'd pay me to listen. One of my favorites.
"Oh lordy that. Here's the ctrl+v I was sending in PMs.

The call center I worked at presented everyone as white ladies. They want you to talk about being hot and only wanting big, black dicks. That's not good enough, oh no. They also want you to talk about how they insist on coming inside of you for the express purpose of ""diluting the white race."" I wish I was kidding. They wanted you to confirm that belief and got butt hurt if you didn't.

And now the funny part. The call always moves to you (the sexy lady voice on the phone) talking through their fantasy: being nailed by a big black dick while the lady watches and comments on how hot for the black guy it makes her. And God help you if you forget to mention that there's a lady watching when they get their ass pounded in this fantasy. If you don't mention that a lady is watching they get offended that you're calling them gay. You read that right"
I can’t. No.

"&gt; Did you enjoy any of it?

There were a couple callers I liked. One was a college professor who would get drunk and play guitar while we had kick ass conversations. I also liked having free access to an ungodly amount of porn and niche publications about trans issues, etc. Any time you weren't on a call you could just read or watch DVDs.

&gt; Did you do any psychological profiles on the callers to anticipate needs they maybe didn’t ask for?

After a while you start to notice patterns. If they say ""bounce"" they want you to talk about boobs, if they say ""wet"" or ""slap"" they want you to talk about hips and booty. Submissive men also prefer the booty talk.

&gt; Did you ever actually do any of the things to yourself you were telling your clients you were doing?

Never. I hate dirty talk and only do it when paid. You just make noises with your mouth and say it's your genitals.

&gt; Why did you stop?

Oh god. I had one regular who was addicted to the service. He would literally beg me to hang up on him, please help him stop, he can't pay his bills/rent but he can't stop...and I can't hang up. The worst were the ""kiddy"" calls. I'm good at doing voices and when there was a request for a particular accent or voice it got kicked to me. I had to role play as a 4-10 year old too many times. Some regulars we would do the finance part of the call and the moment billing started was marked by me switching voices and saying ""Hi Daddy!"" Total mind fuck having to role play that shit. Also, if a man says ""I'm in my step-daughter's room. She's 7. I'm pulling back the covers and..."" You had to not only listen but encourage. You could only hang up if you literally heard a child. 

&gt; Was there a learning curve going in?

Not really. As long as you sounded female you could make it work. 

&gt; Did you ever mess up? Say the wrong thing or say something the caller really didn’t like?

I have 2. One man didn't want me to use the word ""dick"" on his entire call. That's really tough in that line of work. My main ""screw up"" was a guy who was giving me nothing to work with. Answered everything with ""i don't know."" I got frustrated and started talking about World of Warcraft (Alliance!) and all of a sudden he had preferences,"
"In the other thread you said *75% of your calls* devolved into disgusting, racist bullshit. You also mentioned a punchline. Asking about... all of that."

Daddy. He’s old.
"Not a request but a guy named Craig jerking off in his closet because he didn't want his wife to catch him. I made one guy laugh because he told me he wanted the ""weirdest thing I could think of."" When I got around to describing him in a Donald Duck costume licking an oversized lollipop he lost it."
Are there some numbers on daddys credit card? Can you write them down?
Hmm. Smiling.

"Well, those 9 years obviously weren't all smooth. She didn't really cheat on me, but there was a guy who studied the same course with her back when she was still in uni (we had been a couple for 4 years when this happened). 

Basically he tried to hit on her since she didn't tell any of her classmates about me (we want to keep things low, so we both agreed to only tell about our rls when someone directly ask about it). He did things that I couldn't - made her lunch (bento boxes, Japanese-style handmade lunchbox), walked with her home at nights etc. So she has some feelings for that kind of kindness. I only noticed when I skyped her during lunchtime and saw that box, because I was sure she would never make such a cute, neat and complicated one just for her own. When I asked about it, she just said a friend of her made it for her. I called her during lunchtime again about 2 weeks later, and still saw that box - this time with slightly different decoration, but anyone could tell it was made by the same person. I asked again, this time quite furiously and she admitted the time she spent with that guy.

After that call, we didn't talk to each other for more than 3 months. In my mind, I sort of gave up on this rls already and just let time did its job. She then one day called me, apologised for what she did the whole time. What happened was that she found out this guy had a gf himself. Apparently he was hitting on my girl to prove to his gf that he could easily getting on with any girl he wanted (aka being a massive D). 

I of course forgave her, in fact I couldn't blame her at all. She had already been through hardships all those year just to stay loyal and wait for the day we could finally live together. It was just her weak times. To say how I dealt with this, I actually did nothing but gave up. It was her who lit everything up again. I had never loved her more after that whole situation to be honest.

There were several small things along the way too, but that was the most memorable one and I want to share that :)

Foolishly wasting battery. Assuming the power will be back by morning.
"I would describe myself as a very quiet, hermit type of person. I don't go out to parties or social events, although I am not antisocial. I think if I did not have DID, that might be different as I am scared to switch in public. I live a very simple lifestyle, it does not take a lot to make me happy. I enjoy reading and relaxing.

My alter is an opposite, (hence my type). He has to be the centre of attention and will be quite nasty if ignored and as I am very reserved and not interested in dating, he is quite promiscuous. I have had situations in the past where I have woken up in other people's homes, hotel rooms, clubs, so on.

I'd like to think that the real me is the first one, as that is how I was 100% of the time before 18/19 years old. I developed DID in my late teens and did not suffer from any sort of mental illness as a child. "
That’s great but there is basically no way you can explain that to your wife when she finds out you’ve been calling a sex line.

"Yes. He wanted to be called ""Pink Sparkle Pony."" That's the only name I ever had for him. He was a masochist sub. Just wanted you to name off random stuff to stick in his pee hole. He's the guy who was addicted to our service that I mention in another answer."
What is the best part about your lifestyle?

"People usually refer to the other personalities as ""Alters"" and no, I have significant trouble with my alter.

I fall under the disability category and fortunately do not have to worry about finding a job. I would not be able to keep one. However I have always wanted to study rocks, minerals and the earth in general. That is one of my biggest interests.

I have a small group of close friends who are very understanding. Outside of that, I do not find it hard to make friends, I do however find it hard to keep them once they understand what's going on."
What was the *least* sexual call you took? 
Yea...I like juice
"Standby generator with secondary, isolated fuel source?"
"I am disgusted by sex abuse. It creates a victim. I understand the urge, but not the action. I think child abuse should be punished. I wouldn't want to be left alone with a kid and i think parents should be aware that there are a lot of predators in the world. I think pedophiles who act on it are immoral and deserve punishment. It sounds terrible but I'd consider myself a ""good pedophile.""

I don't act on it because it's wrong. I think victims of child abuse/ sex trafficking becomes victims for life. They carry that weight with them. The law is a good reason to stop me from acting on it, but the ethical problems of it is the biggest thing stopping me. "
What's your favorite color?
"The only time we could end a call on our side (beyond medical emergency/the building is burning down) was if we heard a child. The caller could literally be telling you step-by-step what he's doing to a kid and you have to stay on and keep talking about how sexy and brave he is unless you literally heard a child's voice.

Edit: The first part happened a lot but I never actually heard a child, never got to be the one to end a call."
"""What are you wearing?""

Real question: What was the funniest request that you had to hold back audibly laughing at?"
"&gt; What made you accept the job?

I prefer to work third shift and got tired of being the sole worker in the building at my gas station job. I like doing voices too so I thought that part would be fun.

&gt; If the job was bad, why did you stay there for 7 months?

I really didn't want to go back to my old job and couldn't find anything different. Everyone around you at work acts like it's no big deal so your mind just goes ""heh heh, yeah...no biggie..."" until it just snaps and says ""holy shit wtf am I doing talking to a Rabbi about how some 8 year old girls know what they're doing to him *wink wink.*""

&gt; Did any of the clients found out where you live? Are you afraid they do?

No and never. They give you a character with it's own name, bio stats, and college major that they select for you. I was Skylar, 5'2"" 110lbs English major. Not Hotcaulk, .95 Scarlett Johanssons tall and 1.05 Scarlett Johanssons heavy."
correlation isn't causation!
**spits repeatedly**
"This is a hard question to answer, because I can't answer it by myself. I can remember what he does, but I have no idea if he is aware of what I do.

For the most part, I am myself. It's extremely rare for people with my type to have more than one alter, so the ""switches"" are a lot less common. I switch usually every few days, but in certain situations it can be as little as 6 hours, which is still quite long for DID.

Stress, definitely stress. That is the biggest trigger I can think of. I learnt very quickly that alcohol is a trigger, which is why I stay away from it. Mature themed things are also a trigger as my alter is an opposite, and I keep to myself and have no interest in dating, he is the opposite, which causes mature themed things to trigger my alter."

Now you're famous on r/imverysmart how about a follow up
"I learned a lot about fetishes and that whatever turns you on is ok as long as you're not hurting anybody. I had the usual ""weird shame"" around being sexual that most young ladies have. That was no longer a problem after working there. 

It kinda taught me that one man's ""despicable belief"" is another man's ""obvious reason."""
"I can only speak from my experience, so I hope I can help you in your situation with what I know.

I have a different type to most, only having 2 distinct personalities, most people with DID will often have 3 or more, usually more. Which can make remembering things non-existent in most cases.

To understand.. if you can imagine the feeling you get when you want something you shouldn't. You know it isn't good, whether it's a sweet treat, a cigarette, maybe some cheesy romance movie, etc.

You try to resist it, and sometimes it might work... but there will be times where you give in. That is what a switch feels like. You can try your hardest to be the better person and fight it, but it will get you and when it does, there is nothing you can do. 

Your friend will have absolutely no choice in what happens while he isn't himself and the best thing you can do, as long as he is not violent or putting you in a bad situation, is to just be there for him and understand that while you see your friend doing and saying things he wouldn't, try to see past that and realise it isn't him. It is essentially someone else. I see my alter as a completely different person and if any of my friends thought of him as ""another side of me"", I would be devastated.

When I am having a hard time, I would want my friends to simply treat me as me and him as him, and to not get frustrated, irritated or upset with me, over his actions.

If your friend becomes violent or puts you in a bad situation like I was saying earlier, please look after yourself first. Do not get hurt just because this is your friend. People develop mental illnesses for whatever reason, and sometimes it can rip us away from them. It is hard, but sadly, that is life.

I wish you, your friend and his family the best of luck and that nothing will cause you to be separated. Not all people diagnosed with DID have a violent side, but it would be wrong for me to not warn you.

Happy New Year.

Ps. It might be a good conversation point with your friend if you talk to him about what he himself would want you to do when facing his alter/s. I think this would comfort him when he is himself again, even if it makes the alter/s unhappy. At the end of the day, he is himself and not his alter/s."

"Salary, lol. If no one called all night long I made $8 an hour. I received $.45 a minute for talk time. So at the end of an 8 hour day if my talk time money was greater than $64 I made the larger number for the day. So if I'm on dirty calls for 3 hours I made $81, i would get that instead of the $64. "
