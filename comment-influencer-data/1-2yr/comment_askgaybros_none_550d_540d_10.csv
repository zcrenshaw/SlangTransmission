"He asked you to stop, so you stopped. 

He asked you to leave, so you left. 

This is how he will grow. He will learn that not everyone is an abuser and that good people will respect his consent and boundaries. It's not immediate or instantaneous, but what happened was a small step in the right direction. "
"***Update**

for those following Cluelessjacq, I just received the follow message from his uncle 15 minutes ago:  

Dear Mr. ViatorinlovewithRuss:  

I‚Äôm Roshan‚Äôs Uncle Mustafir. It is with a heavy heart I must inform you that Roshan decided to take his own life in February. His father (my sister's husband) threatened to kill him if he ever was found at home. 

Sadly we couldn‚Äôt get him out of Riyadh in time and he was found lifeless in his friend‚Äôs house. 

I managed to get into Roshan‚Äôs email account via his phone and found this email conversation and thought it is important you know. I‚Äôd like to thank you for your support and care. You were the only person who Roshan opened up to and spoke freely. Inshallah he too is looking down on you and thanking you. 

His funeral was held in Dubai as well as Riyadh his home town but I‚Äôd like to believe he will  always be around me here in Dubai. 

Thank you, 
Mustafir

I'm literally in tears as I post this comment-- I never met him, but we exchanged many messages over a month period.  What a fucking waste of a young life!!!"
"I am sorry you feel bad. 

You handled this ***EXACTLY CORRECTLY***

Stop when asked, comply with requests even when unsure of meaning, and finally checking back in for well being. 

There is nothing wrong with what you did, and nothing wrong with what he did. He is grappling with fear and feelings of powerlessness. 

You can move forward by holding his hand and validating him. :

""I want you to always know that sex is what we do together and either one of us can say we need to stop anytime.""

""I want you to know I love you and only want the best for you and for me.""

""I want you to know that I only know how you feel when you tell me how you feel.""

""I want you to know I support you as you figure out how to feel."" 

""I want you to enjoy what we do together, so I need you to talk to me sometimes about what you think of what we do.""
"
Interesting to see what the experience of an attractive man on Grindr is like.

"What a tragedy. Most of the time I feel like we're living in an age of acceptance, and not just tolerance anymore. But then reality strikes down, reminding you parts of this world still relishes in hate, intolerance, and bigotry. I have such a heavy heart for this kid.  "
"If the others are bringing people back and he isn't complaining to them then he is the one in the wrong. The only time I had a problem with a guy bringing back other guys was when he forgot his key at 3am and decided to phone me to open the front door.... Haha

Edit: can't spell key"
"I‚Äôm Albanian. I was born and raised in Albania, and I moved to the US to continue my studies and to leave the homophobia that i see every day. I have a few ideas, but you need to brace yourself. None of them are quick or easy. 

1. Try to apply to the green card lottery as often as you can. Though it may sound difficult to believe, sometimes it‚Äôs as easy as sending the application. I have many friends that have gotten it the first time they applied. Of course this is a matter of luck but you never know. You may get lucky. 

2. Don‚Äôt look for scholarships, look for universities that will accept you. Germany is relative affordable for non-EU countries. Italy is too. Turkey is an option as well. If you wanna try the States, be very careful. You want to apply for universities that offer full aid to international students. The best ones do, but they may also have need-aware acceptance policies.

3. If possible, try to move to the capital of wherever you are. I promise that even though it doesn‚Äôt look like it, a capital is a friendlier place than a random town. 

4. If the abuse gets bad, start documenting it. Take pictures, store them discreetly. And look at potentially seeking asylum. There are a few countries in the world that would accept you and grant asylum. 

5. Hide. It literally pains me to say this but you being well and alive is more important than you being authentic. Try a sport. Join a gym. Whatever. You want to throw people off your tracks. Once you leave, you‚Äôll have more than enough time to be the gayest you can be. If you have ‚Äúgay‚Äù apps on your phone, delete them. If you look up gay stuff on your computer, use incognito mode. Do whatever you need to be okay. 

I wish I had an easy solution. I truly do. I wish I could give you a three step thing that would allow you to be who you are, authentically. But these things take time, they take strategizing, and they take patience. 

And also very importantly, find a way to feed your soul. For me it was anime, music, reading, writing. Being in your situation is a draining and heavy experience, and you want to make sure that you have your wits about you when the time comes for you to make a move. 

Be well, friend. I wish you all that‚Äôs good in the world. PM me if you need me. "

"You‚Äôre 15.

And you used condoms?!?!??

I want to give you the biggest hug right now. You‚Äôre more responsible than fucking 30 year olds that come on here claiming they caught HIV.

The only advice I recommend is continue to use condoms if you‚Äôre going to be sexually active and have sex with people you trust, and of your age group, like a friend."
"If you go for it, you‚Äôve a huge obligation to treat him incredibly well. Help him, prepare him for other guys, and leave him in better shape than you found him. And if you fuck this up, being he‚Äôs so close to your family, it will come back on you. Be prepared for the impact. This is not a simple hook up. "
"Well, when I was a 20 yo twink, I went to a gay bear party and someone asked me if I didn¬¥t know it was for ¬®real men¬®. Dunno if this counts..."
"My response would be something along the lines of, ""Tough shit. We're all young adults living in here and entitled to have sex lives. If you don't like that some of us are having sex, maybe you shouldn't be living in the dorms."" 

Basically, I'd completely gloss over the same-sex aspect of it and lump myself into the same category as the breeders. If he pursues it, then he's forced to either acknowledge that it's only the gay guy that he has an issue with (in which case he can go fuck himself) or pick on the straight guys, as well, which will end just as badly for him."
"Be a stereotype and tell her to shut up? If she continues with this shit she is a danger to your son, seriously. 

If she is anything near a Balkan mom she will go full bonkers mode and totally fuck things up. She might even turn violent to your son, contact the other guy's family, and then a shitstorm will start. Maybe his parents are not like you and he ends up beaten up/chained home. 

Calm her down in one way or _another_."
"Wow, disrespectful. "
"lack of moderation has pros/cons, I guess? "
Most of things is hot when a hot guy does them.
"Gay sex and a hate sandwich, kudos."
"Definitely this.  You‚Äôve done the right thing.  You can maybe suggest some counselling for him if he‚Äôs open to speaking to someone about it...but it seems like it may just take him a bit to recover and fully trust anyone...it‚Äôs not directed at anything you did.   

He will open up in time.  This was a good first step that he actually told you.  

Good luck bros.  "
Kevin Spacey is bored now that he has no job
"Tell him to fuck off and mind his own business.

I‚Äôm being flippant, but if he‚Äôs uncomfortable, that‚Äôs his problem. You shouldn‚Äôt have to adjust your behaviour to accommodate him."
No words to describe how my heart aches for him right now. I hope he is finally at peace
"A coworker from my first job after college invited me to see a planetarium show after work. We arrived early downtown so he suggested we hit a nearby bar. While there I noticed there were very few woman and some men had rings hanging from their belt loops. I asked what they were and he told me they were cock rings. I then saw two guy kissing in the corner and realized I was in a gay bar. I was still innocent and had not yet decided that I was more gay than straight (I'm bi). I told my friend that I was glad I was with him so no one would hit on me. Years later, I realized of course that my coworker was hitting on me. "

Are you on a plane serving a hot guy drinks right now? 
"Omg. I know. And to make it worse, my parents will be like ‚Äúso any girlfriends?‚Äù Then my brother snort-laughs saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs got tons of gal pals.‚Äù Won‚Äôt be so funny once I fuck one of his frat bros."
The risk of HIV transmission through unprotected sex with a virally suppressed HIV+ person is actually lower than the risk with someone who believes themselves to be negative. 
And why isn‚Äôt OP explicitly discussing safer sex methods *before* he goes over to someone‚Äôs house?
"Just remind yourself that he is the same boy he's always been. He is not a different person just because he decided to share one piece of information about himself with you. It means he felt comfortable enough to tell you and that is a good thing! don't make him feel ostracized or weird for this submission, he can't change and he expects you will still love him no matter what and he should. It's really not that big of a deal anymore. Think of it like he told you that he likes chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla. I mean yes, that's totally different in reality and being gay does carry more weight than that, but it's not the end of the world, and at the end of the day it is just a fact and something you have to accept and deal with whether you like it or not. I'm sure he's a great kid. Be there for him, let him know you stand with him and care about how he feels and that he can be open with you. There is no greater gift you can give your son than acceptance and solidarity. It is nothing you did that 'made him' gay. He is gay and he always has been since birth. 
Good luck. 
PS; people really don't get AIDS anymore unless HIV is left untreated for many many years. It's very manageable and not a death sentence. He will be fine. Just Remind him to always practice safe sex and to be careful. It's HIGHLY unlikely to happen if he is being safe. "
"Talk. To. Him. If he doesn't want to show you the respect you give him, you should leave. "
"It happens when you‚Äôre young. People want to show acceptance by pigeonholing you into their idea of what a gay man is supposed to be. 

It‚Äôs a form of acceptance but it‚Äôs also kind of offensive. Tell her politely you‚Äôre not an accessory.

I remember meeting girls like this in college. They‚Äôd invite themselves over unannounced and get mad that I wasn‚Äôt dropping my videogames to hang. My neighbor called me the worst gay ever when I told her I don‚Äôt wanna go shopping with her.  "
Manspreading *can* be hot. I don't think it's hot by default.
"A couple of years ago I was traveling for work through the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Emirates) and I received a message from Grindr stating that for my own safety they would not display distance. As soon as I came back to Germany it was all normal. I believe the company actively blocks that functionality to avoid a hunt from repressive governments..."
Of course it is you are both consenting adults

Goodnight everybody.

Condoms magically appearing on dicks after the fucking starts.
"Omg the other day I made a comment criticizing a 17 year old for being so fucking focused on finding some dick and got downvoted for it. Maybe it was the assholish way I said it, but it was surprising to me either way. Idk if that‚Äôs relevant to this post. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs a combination of being a relatively anonymous and having a lot of teens on this sub. It‚Äôs weird. We shouldn‚Äôt be sexualizing children. (Yes Ariel if you‚Äôre 16 you‚Äôre still a child.)"
"Just to clarify, if he is at halls in Britain they are not really his housemates. His room is completely separate it is not like they even share a house or anything like that. So that guy is actually being a complete dick. You can even have a party at your room and even an orgy (not even kidding) and you wouldn't be at fault as long as you weren't loud after 11pm I think it's the usual time they require people to be a bit more quiet. This is your private space at uni and nobody other than halls staff should be able to tell you what to do.  God what a douchebag. I think you should bring more guys back at your halls just to piss him off. #notpassiveagressive"
Too late you‚Äôre married. 
"And people downvote me in this sub quite freely when I have the balls to criticize Islam and Muslims and 'evangelical' Christianity and 'Christians'.

This is the result. We lose yet another soul to them but can't agree to state the facts: anti-gay, anti-woman religions are medieval, backwards, toxic, and must be eliminated from if not just our free secular Western cultures - the Earth entirely. 

Neither of these religions are inherently evil and their books (mostly) instruct peace. But that doesn't match up with the actual behavior of adherents whose priests and imams have warped it, you can make an ancient book say anything you want it to if you're clever enough and your congregants are stupid enough. Catholics used to relish that the bible was in Latin and only the priests could read it versus the lay people who were barely literate in their own language."
"I like the more flamboyant guys probably more than anyone else in this sub, but I don't think it's wrong to make jokes. I also think Rippon brings a lot of it on himself with his attention seeking behavior. Wearing a bondage harness to the Oscars was pretty classless. "
"In my city, there's a gay bar that has a stunning variety of craft beers. They do carry the miller lite and the rest, but that's overshadowed by a ton of different craft beers both on tap and in bottles. It's gotten us the occasional confused straight couple on a pub crawl when a Whitney Houston song comes on, and the whole place goes ""AAAA YASSSS"". 

And there are some gay bars that are more subtle about being gay bars. No random rainbow flags, or all kind of kitschy shit on the walls. It's well possible that the guy you were chatting with was trying to flirt with you, and you weren't responding in kind, and he wanted to check that you /are/ indeed gay, and that he's not going to be met with violence should you turn out to be straight and an asshole. "
"You have to keep in mind that her actions may have very serious consequences. I am talking about _fatal_ ones. 

Talk to her about this so she distracts a little. Also, if this is your only child I can understand her, at least in context. 

Just go out somewhere. She is in a near mental-breakdown (I am assuming). Go to a big park or somewhere calm, take a long walk and talk. Talk about everything she is feeling, let her let it out. 

I am sorry to tell you, but you are the ""hero"" in this house and the duty to keep it together is yours now. 

PS. It is mentally beneficial for her if she changes ""atmosphere"". She is under a lot of stress now and being home where every object reminds her of her ""baby"" is not helping. "

Movie was amazing and the theatre thought so too. No cringe no negativity. Pure love, laughter and genuine excitement. Girls behind us excited for him to find love and cried. People clapped...a lot. Theatre was literally sold out and packed and the entire theatre just blew up with positive emotion. 

This is gonna be shown in a lot of places. This is going to open up minds everywhere and I‚Äôm super grateful for it. My heart was SO warm through the entire experience because it wasn‚Äôt a gay movie, it was a love story and people were watching it as a love story. Understanding it as a love story. Embracing it as a love story. 

I can‚Äôt stop talking about it and I‚Äôm so grateful we‚Äôre heading in this direction.  "

"Commented this on the same article posted on r/gaybros so I'll just repost it verbatim:

While the increase in HIV in the Philippines is a problem with many factors, this is a classic anti-scientific, sensationalist headline from the Independent. This increase is *not* being caused by a new super strain. 

[The report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971217301546)

The actual study specifically says they found no difference in outcome with treatment, between this and other strains of HIV, however it *is* more aggressive and may lead to quicker progression of the disease if untreated. They specifically say that the new strain being discussed isn't heavily treatment resistant and that ARVs still work well with it. While this strain *is* more aggressive, the report at no point suggests that the massive increase in HIV is significantly driven by this new strain.

Please please please don't get your science/health news from newspapers like this guys, the people writing these articles don't understand the science, and don't care about accuracy."

You didn't have your first sexual experience (with another guy)  with a random stranger from the internet or an anonymous dark room meet up.  It was with a trusted friend, you really have nothing to feel bad. about.     

Best advice keep use protection and only do what your comfortable with.

"You might be surprised that some guys actually fantasise about being a kind of stereotypical fantasy '50s housewife, where their partner comes home from work and immediately bends them over the kitchen table before asking what's for dinner? Although like you've found the reality might be less enjoyable in the longer term.  
  
The crucial question for me would be have you talked about this to him? It's odd that you don't mention that anywhere. If not you really must. If you have done so on multiple occasions then it simply sounds like you want different things from a relationship which is usually fatal to a relationship even when there is shared love. People can change of course but it's not a bad rule to date people based on how they are instead of how you wish they were."

"Hi! I am a gay teenager who is 16 so about your son's age. Coming out to your parents is quite a difficult thing when you do it, and you were right to stay calm and reassure him it is okay. That is his greatest fear. I am just going to bullet a few things you said...

&gt;Did I do something wrong / did my wife's overprotection make this happen

No, not at all. Being gay is thought to be mostly or entirely genetically based; it was decided when he was born, and no way of raising him would change that. If you are authoritarian or mean for him you may never have found out; if you were extremely close you may have found out a little sooner. But he was always going to be / always is gay, your parenting won't change that.

&gt;I don't want my son to be made fun of or get bullied or get AIDS

Well this depends on where you live, if it is very conservative the maybe. I am from Denmark which is a very progressive country so maybe my opinion is a bit skewed. But among young people today there is very high support for gay people, the odds are his friends and schoolmates are probably chiller with it then the teachers or other adults like you are. You want to keep an eye out just in case, but he will probably be just fine. And know he will likely not get AIDS; good sex education almost completely eliminates the risk, there is medicine that can prevent you from catching the virus with 99.9% effectiveness, and there is medicine that can nearly perfectly treat the virus (only it is expensive in the US and has in some people unpleasant side effects, but AIDS is unlikely to shorten his lifespan anymore). Teach him to use condoms with strangers and be sex safe and he is very likely to never get it, which you should do with any child because there are other dangerous STDs (for everyone) that aren't talked about as much.

&gt;I really hope to have grandkids too but that's also out of the question now

Ehhhh, no, not necessarily. It should ultimately be your son's decision if he wants children or not, but it is popular for gay couples now a days to adopt if they want kids, or alternatively (if your country allows it) you can use a surrogate parent to provide the other 50% of DNA. That probably won't come up for many years, and it should be his decision, but you might not be out of grandchildren yet. And not all straight people wind up having children either.

&gt;I want my son to be happy but I am also worried sick

That is understandable and normal. It is a normal reaction to what you feel is a big change. But he is still the same person you knew last week; nothing has changed. He is the same boy you have always known. You might wind up thinking about some new plans but odds are he is probably going to have a very similiar life to the one he would have as a straight person. I wouldn't worry at all; this feels like a big change for you but with time you will see that he is still your amazing son :D"

Don't make me break out the spray bottle!"
"1.  There's a difference between ""my husband is afraid of me"" and ""something I did in one specific moment alarmed/frightened my husband.""  

2.  The kind of reaction you're describing is largely instinctive, originating way deep in the brain - deeper than his knowledge of you and of your feelings for him.  It was an involuntary reaction triggered by something specific you said/did in that moment, not a revelation of some fear he's kept secret from you.  

3.  You apologized.  Now just let it lie."

"No, no, no, no.   Did I say ""No""?   His behavior is inappropriate and compromises you as well as himself.   He is your boss, first last and always.  If the relationship doesn't develop to his liking or is exposed, he won't be the one to take a fall.

I worked in management my entire career.   One of the first things I learned in the many trainings I went through is that the manager /subordinate relationship is not a good situation for a sexual / social relationship.   When YOU are 40 years old, I hope you will have a better innate sense of the power imbalance inherent in this kind of situation.

"It's really something that gives me so much sadness and confusion.

All the things I condemn and hate ‚Äì from murder to fraud to rape to making a ruckus in the movie theater when I'm trying to watch a movie ‚Äì I can come up with a straightforward, logical reason why I condemn and hate these things.

I can usually try to understand why people feel the way they feel about a certain topic. Like, I'm not conservative and probably never will be, but I've expended enough effort and time and talked to enough conservatives and read enough conservative literature that I could understand how and why a conservative thinks the way they do about most things.

But... this kind of intense homophobia, I just draw a blank. I could see why someone raised in a purely heteronormative climate over the last half century might feel a reflexive twang of disgust or confusion or hesitation with respect to gays, because them being a cultural force and being open about it is ""new"" and therefore confusing/frightening. It's dumb and irrational but I would get why.

but when I read:

&gt;His father (my sister's husband) threatened to kill him if he ever was found at home.

Like...  what the fuck? How can anyone lead a functional day-to-day life, have a career and family and social/religious life, and yet have a part of them that burns with violent, murderous hate for something that's innocuous? You can't associate homosexuality with tangible harms to society like you can breaking-and-entering, or setting a church on fire, or refusing to hire people of a certain race. like.... how do these people think? how can they be sane in most respects and just batshit crazy in others?

edit: and especially to say that to your own damn son. like what the fuck?"

"I was out drinking with some buddies and trawling through Grindr for some ass. His profile was cute, I was drunk and horny, and so I messaged him. About an hour later I was at his apartment fucking his brains out. I ended up crashing afterward. In the morning he bashfully apologized and said that it had been hot but that hookups made him feel gross and he probably wouldn't want to do it again because he was looking for something meaningful.

My exact, hungover words (which he still likes to quote) are: ""I would date the fuck out of you."" The rest is history, and the only reason I'd consider doing it differently is having to lie to my suburban relatives about how we met."

Don't wanna stay at home while he works? Get your own job. Want him to pleasure you in bed? Tell him, maybe hold out on sex until he does. 

If he doesn't like any of these ideas then ditch his ass. Why the fuck are you even with him if you're not into him being this much of a control freak?"

"I haven‚Äôt seen the movie, but honestly Rupaul‚Äôs Drag Race helped me a lot with that.

"does interaction with him make you happy? if yes, keep doing what you're doing and things will probably develop on their own.

bromance is a real thing, though -- straight guys can develop powerful but pllatonic attractions to one another, it's not uncommon at all. my brother is straight and had an intense bromance in high school that i don't think went further than mutual brotherly-type love and admiration.

be good to him and yourself and go with it. be honest with yourself, you may find you really care for the guy but don't want to go the distance of getting into bed with him. or maybe you will, whatever you do, don't get your ideas for what to do in bed from gay porn üò∏ maybe ask here instead? don't put pressure on yourself or him re: sex though, imo. you'll find out pretty fast that guy on guy sex is great but sort of not a big deal..

though the family aspect is a tough one -- can't relate to that, sorry i can't help. if something develops i hope you can bring your fam around.

all the best to you."

I had a guy ask me if I was gay once. He assumed I was straight based on my clothing and mannerisms.  And this was a raunchy after hours bar, not a place you are likely to find straight guys.  

So I confirmed I was gay and took him back home to, ahem, drive in the point.  "

"Hey brother. 

Catholic here, raised Opus Dei, so you get an idea. 

My father, gay, Catholic, did exactly what you are describing. Married my mom because of a pregnancy, had two more kids, and proceeded to live in hell for 40 years. When the last one of us left home, my mother caught him with another guy and divorced him very fast. Her words ""I don't care that he's gay, I cared that I wasted 40 years of my life living someone else's lie when I could've married someone who could genuinely love me back; I'm too old now for that"". 

Don't do that to her or to you, or to your kid. "
This sounds really great and romantic in its own way. I mean you are not going to have kids with both your genetic code so cousins doesn't really matter here tbh.  I really wish you all the best. Please keep us informed.

Roll back his foreskin and it was smeg central and genuinely smelled like fish. I‚Äôm literally dry heaving but didn‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings so I went down on him anyway but after like 5 minutes I ran to the bathroom and vomited, which probably hurt his feelings more than me asking him to wash his dick or just not sucking him.

Uh, most guys under the age of 50 have no problem talking about their feelings. You're guilty of employing the toxic male stereotype to all men when it's really just your insecure boyfriend that has the problem. 

Do not marry him under any circumstances until you've had at least a year together where this hasn't been a problem. There's no actual rush to get married. His parents don't get to dictate your life's timeframe. "

"That's because some people still assume that all gay men are Frou-frou Broadway obsessed hairdresser types.

"If you told her that you're gay, she knows exactly why you have it. Tell her to fuck off or tell her why you bought it.

After everyone told you not to... what's the point of even asking for advice?

"Oof where do I start

2) The fact that the vast majority of guys can't accommodate. You end up sending nudes n shit, and then when ""travel or accom?"" is asked, neither one can accom. Dead end. 

3) That guys can't label their body types correctly. I've seen so many average bod guys under the ""jock"" tribe. And no, just because you're not overweight that doesn't make you ""toned"". "

I'm almost certainly overthinking it."

What drives me crazy about these kinds of encounters is if you are straightforward with a person and tell them exactly how you feel about them they freak out. But go your whole life subtly flirting with people and wonderful opportunities are missed out on possibly once in a lifetime.

"***Update**

for those following Cluelessjacq, I just received the follow message from his uncle 15 minutes ago:  

Dear Mr. ViatorinlovewithRuss:  

I‚Äôm Roshan‚Äôs Uncle Mustafir. It is with a heavy heart I must inform you that Roshan decided to take his own life in February. His father (my sister's husband) threatened to kill him if he ever was found at home. 

Sadly we couldn‚Äôt get him out of Riyadh in time and he was found lifeless in his friend‚Äôs house. 

I managed to get into Roshan‚Äôs email account via his phone and found this email conversation and thought it is important you know. I‚Äôd like to thank you for your support and care. You were the only person who Roshan opened up to and spoke freely. Inshallah he too is looking down on you and thanking you. 

His funeral was held in Dubai as well as Riyadh his home town but I‚Äôd like to believe he will  always be around me here in Dubai. 

Thank you, 
Mustafir

Both of you are freaking out over what you believe to be are the repercussions of this revelation, but are largely blind to the fact that he's been living it for the past 2 years, without your knowledge, and has been fine. Ironically, the worst consequence of being gay he has experienced is from his own parents, not the rest of the world. You're on the right track, but you need to make your wife see that she is going to ruin both of your relationships with him. She sounds incredibly toxic and if I were to give him advice, I'd tell him to cut her out of his life until she can act like an adult."
