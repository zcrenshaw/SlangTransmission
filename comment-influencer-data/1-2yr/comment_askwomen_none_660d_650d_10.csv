"I used to think that being an adult and doing the basic adult stuff (cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, doing dishes and so on) was something every adult does. It isn't. I've spent way too much of my time taking care of grown men like they are children. So, I now have a dating dealbreaker that the person I date has to be an adult mentally too, not just physically."
"My experience as a former educator and childcare worker: girls are more likely than boys to believe they need school to move forward/get ahead. 

Most of my work was with lower income and middle class students. The boys usually told me they planned to work with their dads/in their dad's industry, or go into the military, or go into sports. Often they do need school for these things long term, but they don't see that early on.

Girls were more likely to have a career goal for which they felt they needed a degree and therefore needed good grades. Military and sports careers are sold to girls less often, and you still have less of a tradition in families of welcoming daughters to the ""family business""."
"**How we're half the population but still an afterthought.**  Why did I have to wait so long for Apple to even realize that their Health app should include information about menstruation cycles?  Why don't medicines get properly tested to make sure they're safe for women, who are physiologically different from men?  Why do most people still not know what heart attacks in women look like, and that the symptoms are different from men's?  

**How invasive literally everything is.**  Mammograms, gynecology visits, having to confess #metoo just so everyone you know fully grasps that sexual harrassment is an ongoing struggle even for those of us that don't seem like ""the type"" to get harrassed.  I'm an overweight black woman who is not that attractive - and *I* get catcalled all the time.  

**How fucking expensive everything is.**  Make it pink and add an upcharge.  And wtf is with the price of bras?  

**The lack of access women face.**  Especially to basic things like sanitation pads.  This is mostly an issue in poorer areas but a serious one.  People think about food and shelter, rightly so, but the lack of access to basic menstrual supplies is utterly dehumanizing.  I feel demoralized if I run out of pads for a few hours - how horrible must it be to never have access to any?

**HOW SO MANY CLOTHES STILL DON'T FUCKING HAVE POCKETS.**  Whhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy."
"People who answer a question with an irrelevant comment because the question doesn‚Äôt apply to them. For example, if the question is ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite classic rock song‚Äù there‚Äôs always that one person who will answer ‚ÄúNone, I don‚Äôt like classic rock.‚Äù Then why answer? 

Besides that, I downvote comments that are rude, needlessly argumentative, bigoted, or obvious trolling. "
"That I have to convince people that birth control is taken for many medical issues. Where‚Äôs *your* doctorates degree, Debra?"
"A guy I dated for a while told me that his brother and his wife had been trying for a baby for a few years but so far they hadn't managed to conceive. I remarked that that must be really difficult for both of them. He said, ""it's difficult for my brother, not her!"" I asked why and he said ""she knows how much he wants a baby and shes not getting pregnant on purpose just to get back at him for xyz fight!"" I thought he was joking at first, but then I actually had to explain to a fully grown man that women can't just turn their fertility on and off at will and if that waa the case, there would be no unplanned pregnancies. He had his eureka moment, ""OHHHHHHH so *that's* why you always insist we use a condom."""
"I won't date a guy who describes himself as ""logic-driven"" or any variation of that in a dating profile. On multiple occasions I've discovered this to be something that asshole guys use as their excuse to ignore or belittle the way their shitty behavior makes you feel, because they don't ""get"" emotions.  "
"Treat the other girls and women in her life with dignity. Children don't just hear what we tell them; they see everything we do. 

One of the greatest gifts my dad gave me was how he treated my mom. As I got older, I saw that he also accorded other women respect and listened to them instead of talking over or dismissing them. At the time, I didn't really notice it, but in looking back, I could see how different that was from how life was in many of my friends' households. 

He was also involved in my life in ways not every dad was. When my mom had to work, he'd take over the Brownie troop meetings. He helped me with my homework as often as my mom did, though in different subjects. He was just...*there* so much. Until he died, he was there, too; we talked every day (and multiple times on Sunday as he would call to celebrate every time the Saints scored a touchdown). 

Treat other women well and be there for her, and you're doing it right. "
"My now boyfriend invited me back to his place after visiting the bars for his friends birthday. He had the neatest room and had tastefully decorated that and his bathroom. Seeing pictures of his family on his dresser made me super comfortable that he wasn't a douche bag. Odd, but I liked it üòè"
"I won't date a guy who describes himself as emotional. Twice I did and twice it actually meant they have anger issues and don't know how to express or cope with their emotions in healthy ways. 

I also won't date anyone who calls their exes ""crazy"" and highlights, especially at the beginning of my relationship with them, how different I am to these exes. In my experience it implies that the guy lacks self-awareness, is completely unable to take responsibility for anything bad that happens in the relationship, and blames the other party for the failure of it. Oh, and he'll likely call you crazy too.  "
"His kitchen. It's all sleek chrome, with gorgeous overhead lighting. And it's *clean*. 

He started telling me about doing all the tile work himself; I pictured him all sweaty, hands all dirty. It was *over*. üòç"
"An ex told me, ""You can't have waffles for dinner. That's breakfast food."" 

So, I ordered a big waffle and watched as he sulked and rolled his eyes the entire dinner because *I dared to eat a waffle for dinner, when it's only for breakfast*. "
"My great grandmother knew my older girl cousins were getting raped by their step dad and let it go on because she didn't want to deal with her daughter or giving them money because the step dad was rich... My family is fucked. My mom's side at least

"My dad had been unfaithful to my mom. It all unraveled when red roses kept appearing at his grave. We asked around, no one copped to it until one of my dad‚Äôs buddies admitted to knowing who it could be. Apparently my dad had bragged about how clueless his family was about the affair. Everyone knew but us. Made it sting a little more after my mom took care of his abusive ass for two years as he died of lung cancer.  My mom isn‚Äôt perfect, but she didn‚Äôt deserve finding out like that. "
"Great grandpa had a whole second family that he kept concealed his entire life. Wife, 3 kids, house, car, the works. My mom found the photos and letters in his desk when they were clearing out his things. 

My great grandmother was so furious she burned all the evidence and refused to speak of it ever again. With no way to contact them, I‚Äôm just left with the knowledge of mystery blood relatives out there somewhere."
"Identifying as the ""logical"" one in the relationship but not having handle on his anger. 

Like no, you are not Vulcans. "
"I'm told my great grandpa was a steaming pile of shit. Horribly abusive, manipulative, etc. But he always told a story of stabbing a guy to death in a bar parking lot while visiting his hometown. Everyone thought this was too far even for him and had no evidence to substantiate it. He died in the late '70s.

About 20 years later, my Uncle was chatting to a guy in a bar. The guy starts talking about his dad's murder...

Same location, timeframe, stabbed to death, perpetrator never caught. My uncle was spooked.

"
"Beer bottles everywhere, blood on the pillowcases, rusty razors in the sink and shower, beard trimmings all over. He was a very attractive man but my god. "
He's completely unwilling to take responsibility for his words and actions. 
I tell myself that it's ridiculous to throw a pity party when I haven't made any effort to find someone who wants to date me. 
If rose had shared the door with jack they both would‚Äôve sunk. He tried it at the beginning and it was starting to sink so that‚Äôs why he got off. I‚Äôm tired of hearing about how much room that door had
"The night I met my ex, I offered to drive him home since he split up with his friends to hang out with me longer. When I walked in, I noticed a giant cat tower and thought ""wow he's a cat person."" So then I asked him about it and got to meet his two adorable cats. You could tell he really loved them. 

I'm a cat person myself so it was a huge plus. "
"I moved to the US for college and didn't understand what negging was. There was a guy who would basically say things to me, like ""I couldn't date Asian women, they're so ugly"".

Then when I started dating a friend of his, he started saying things like ""We would have been so good together, I don't even know why you like him"".... I reminded him what he said about Asain women and he got upset at me, saying that it was typical that I was holding a grudge since I'm Asian -_- ugh... just no."
"I wore and ugly Christmas sweater, red plaid slacks and reindeer earrings while everyone else was in their work clothes (suits). I stood out like a sore thumb for sure. But people had told me they dress Christmasy for the party. W hat they meant was red ties with a snowman tie pin or snow flake jewelry or little details like that.  No one told me that Christmasy meant ""well add an almost unnoticeable amount of Christmas to your normal outfit"".

I embraced it though and made a point of being extra cheerful to everyone around."
This is WILD I AM SO CONCERNED
"He said ""I'm sorry for the mess, I didn't expect anyone to come over"" and there was only like one pair of shoes out of place and a dish in the sink. So, I knew he was neat and held himself to a high standard if that ""mess"" was enough to embarrass him. Also, he had two cats who instantly rubbed up against me, and I figured it takes a special kind of guy to have two very friendly cats."
"""I can't believe that guy is hitting on you, you look fucking hideous"" "
"I won't date people who expect me to respond to their texts within the hour every time, without fail. I need someone who can tolerate a few hours (especially during the workday) of radio silence. Something that is an even more *immediate* dealbreaker for me is when a guy accuses me of ""playing games"" because I didn't answer him immediately. I have stuff to do, dude!

The origin of this originally stems from a guy I went on a single date with, a couple days before my mother came (from six hours away) to visit. I didn't answer his texts for 4-5 hours while entertaining her, and unlocked my phone to an ungodly torrent of texts from him accusing me of ""playing games"" and attacking me for not even ""taking the time"" to respond to him. I have no tolerance for anybody who's that needy."
My grandpa had a collection of cartoon drawings depicting white men raping Native American women and burning down their houses.
"
I went with my date to his apartment. Met his roommate. Mr. Roommate talked to Mr. Date about how the chores would be splitted this week. 

Mr. Date explained to me how Mr. Roommate was managing the bills, chores and, sometimes, doing minor reparations. 

I'm close to hit 10 years with Mr. Roommate. "
"I agree with the other responses. I also think another sign of emotional immaturity is not being able to deal with your own emotions but needing other people to deal with them for you and imbalanced emotional labor.

In a relationship this can especially show in a situation where the guy (per OP's title) fucked up in some way that makes his partner feel not-good. Instead of making room for their partner to feel not-good, he wants his wronged partner to take care of *his* feelings of guilt/failure/""I'm bad"", comfort him and then conveniently all attention and emotional labor is directed towards him instead of the person he let down. "
"In my experience, the responses i got from people changed based on where I was with my boyfriend. In the city people stared but not as often as they do in the more rural, southern part of my state. We also got more dirty looks &amp; glares when we were in the south too. My SO live 3 hours away from each other (me in the city) and the differences were very noticeable. People in the city seemed to care a lot less and most of the time, not even acknowledge my interracial relationship. "
"We had an ""On the Couch"" session with our executive team at work, two men and two women, and someone asked about their education and whether post-grad is needed to advance. The two men had just undergrad degrees, the two women has post-grad. They were like ""see, it doesn't matter"" but I think all the women heard ""it doesn't matter if you're a man."""
"That in the USA you still can't just get a year's worth of birth control pills at a time. It regularly takes me 4-5 phones calls with the doctor's office, pharmacy and insurance agency just to get three months worth of pills. 

And God forbid you need to change pills and need to know what can safely take, that's covered by your insurance. The doctor's office said, ""We don't know what's covered by your insurance, ask them."" The insurance agent said, ""We don't know what you can safely take, ask your Pharmacy."" The pharmacy said, ""We know what your insurance covers, but can't recommend any pills without your medical history. Your doctor needs to tell you."" I can the doctor's office again and, bless get heart, one girl tells me how to get a list of covered prescriptions from my insurance, then transfers me to a doctor so I can read off the list and the doctor can tell me which I should get a prescription for. Why does it need to be so hard!!! "
"Dated a guy who claimed her wasn't religious, and made fun of Christians. BUT he believed that Heaven and Hell were the only option. Like, he didn't realize it was a religious concept, he just thought it was true.

"This. I can't believe it needs to be said but I need a guy who can take care of himself! My boyfriend cleans his own dishes, washes his own clothes, pays his own bills with his own money that he works hard to earn, and prepares his own meals. Be an adult. I will take care of myself and expect him to do the same.   "
"Six months being single after being cheated on I was out drinking realizing I needed to get over myself and I was horny. I never intended to hook up with anyone. I met him while I was playing Buck Hunter and he was playing pool right next to me. We connected and found out we lived a block away. We met up... and I intended it to be my first one night stand ever. I needed it. I was bitter and broken. 

He was just so awesome. So kind. Probably everything I had wanted with any guy I have been with...ever. his house was clean. It smelled amazing.  I believe in fate.  I think we needed each other. He was out of a relationship almost a year. I needed someone. 

I had the best night of my life. 

Yet... I still intended him to be my one night stand. I was that jaded.  After how awesome and sweet he was...I was still set on it being a one night stand. Yet... he called me the next night (I honestly didn't think he would).  Hearing his god damn deep and beautiful voice, it sent chills up my spine. He asked me out again. We have been married 10 years with two beautiful daughters.  He is truly the love of my life. He is the best one night stand that never happened to me. And his voice still sends chills up my spine.

Sorry for the tangent. Only a best friend of mine knows this story and I  had a few drinks tonight. Sorry if it was wordy and doesn't count. "
"if my feelings or needs get dismissed even once in early dating, i can't stick around to see how disrespectful and dismissive they will be when the love hormones die down. i am not asking for compliance, just a simple acknowledgement that i have the right to have certain feelings/needs. 

and *never again* with Mr. Always Joking. as long as they follow up anything shitty they say by laughing, it's a joke and you're not allowed to take it seriously. i should have ran when i said ''i don't belong to you, i don't exist for your amusement'' and he replied ''yes you do, haha'' and was infuriated that laughing while saying it didn't work.
"
"Oh goodness, it's always so poorly done.

Incredibly enough, there IS a way to do this correctly, where everyone involved is having fun- it's called flirting. ""All the drinks in the bar, and you get the sparkly hot pink one?"" is something that, when said in a joking and playful fashion, can be a segue into a great conversation between people who A) enjoy being a bit competitive/teasing, B) are both at a bar to meet people, and C) have established some sort of previous conversation that seems to be leading in a positive direction. I say there's a way to do this correctly because realistically, all these poor saps trying out ""negging"" for the first time just want to be the charming guy with a good pick-up line who can establish a rapport with women. The real issue is, ""negging"" as described by the strangely robotic PUA artists is ""a way to get women to subconsciously prove their worth to you"", as if the guy joking around with women at the bar is a secret predator and not just a fun and charismatic person.

This is why PUA's need to learn... a lot, about being normal people. PUA books like The Game are written in a style that makes meeting and dating people seem so calculating and foreign that losers who read the book feel validated in their inability to meet and connect with people. ""Of course I can't talk to the girl in my math class, she's after Alphas and I need to acheive 100 Power Points by agressively pursuing women in bars to get my Confidence Skill up! That's what all the other guys know how to do by heart and I somehow missed!"" These are the guys pathetically trying to ""neg"" instead of learning emotional maturity and humor, and then being able to flirt/tease effectively."

"1000% bodily autonomy. Don't get her ears pierced without her permission .Don't force her to hug family members in greeting. Don't force her to wear clothes she doesn't want to wear. Don't control her hair. 

This will pay off. if she sees her body as her own dominion from day 1, she will have a much healthier ability to take care of it and take ownership of it. This translates into health decisions, athletics, self esteem and sexual decisions as a teenager.

I found out that my grandmother was raped and my mom was the product of it. It made a lot of sense as to why she refused to talk about my grandfather to both my mom and me. My mom eventually found out from her stepfather and wouldn't tell me until very recently. It was the reason why she came to America--she felt shame for having a child out of wedlock (which is horrible because it was 100% not her fault).

"Coming from the POV of a mom with both a boy and a girl:

Many schools are set up to benefit students who can sit still, be quiet, and follow directions. Oftentimes, those students are predominantly girls. I think that schools need a restructuring to accommodate multiple learning modalities. The educational system (at least in the US) is set up to school the masses, not to meet the needs to the individual student, which I think it the wrong way to tackle education. I think we need MORE teachers, we need to pay teachers more money, and have educational techniques more focused on the individual student's needs."

"**tl;dr: Dali-esque doors, light squalor, and growing horrealizations**

I went to this guy's house not for sex (in theory), but to smoke. (Backstory: I had previously hung out at bars with him, first with mutual friends, and secondly just the two of us. He was pretty socially awkward, but that's something I really empathize with, and he otherwise seemed like a decent guy. Before we met up the second time, though, I made it clear that I was not interested in dating him, but was happy to go for after-work drinks now and again. He understood this and seemed happy to find someone to smoke with him.)

My first clue that something was off was the door buzzer. It was a big apartment building, so there were a lot of apartment numbers/buttons on the board. All of the buttons were placed in *random order*. I thought *what the fuck bizarro dreamscape am I in?*, shrugged, eventually located his number, and buzzed in. (Not this guy's fault, but an omen of sorts.)

Then the apartment. Oh my god, the filth. Every surface was covered with pizza boxes, other food garbage, or tracked-in dirt. (Keep in mind that this was a guy in his early 30s making a good enough salary that he could pay someone to clean his small apartment for him at least once a month.) I should have left then, but I was too polite. I perched on the clean inch of the living room futon in sight.

Cue the awkward conversation. ""Do you want something to drink?"" he asked. ""Water'd be good,"" I said. He got out two red solo cups from a cabinet jammed full of them (no other dishes in sight) and poured water from a milk carton he kept in the fridge.

""Not a fan of tap?"" I [attempted to] joke. (NYCers are infamously annoying about the quality of our tap water.) He stared at me in utter uncomprehension. ""Tap water would be unclean.""

I tried as to make the atmosphere as comfortable as I could while remaining in my two square inches of living room, but this was impossible. He suggested we smoke, and I was relieved. *Surely this will lighten the mood.*

A minute later we were in his bedroom (my hackles immediately up) where the only window was. For the next five minutes, he attempted to light his vaporizer. After some commiseration (""some of them are a little weird at first"") and light teasing (""I thought you said you smoked"") he finally giggled and responded with ""I've never used a vaporizer...actually I've never really done this before.""

Well, fuck. I was in a strange bedroom with a weirdo guy who had apparently *taken up weed in order to see me*. Now I *need* this weed. Soundlessly I gestured for the vaporizer and get things moving. A couple tokes in, we were both more relaxed, and I was keenly aware that any more time spent in this dump with this man would result in my death of secondhand embarrassment. In the space of 30 seconds I made some pathetic excuse and fled.

On my way to the train, my phone vibrated, signaling new texts:

""That was fun, right?"" And then:

""Come back hehe""

And finally, a few minutes later:

""Please?"""
Stuff like this makes me think everyone else is a damn rapist and I should watch my wife and kids 24/7. It's really messed up.

He constantly worries about ‚Äúscrewing up‚Äù. It blows his mind that I enjoy touching him simply to just him (rub his back, hold his hand, whatnot).

the most obviously time was when he went out of his way to text me that one of the songs on his work playlist was absolutely terrible and that he didn't know the name of it the first few times, but found out that it was a song by the Beatles and had to text me about it. He then continued to ""tease"" me and go on and on about how terrible they are, because he knew they're my favorite band.

"An ex told me he respected that I didn't sleep with him on the first date. I reminded him that he tried to get me in bed on the first date and I turned him down.

"I can't get close to anyone who acts put out, drags their feet when helping and is surly afterward when I ask for help. I hate asking for help, but it's made worse when I'm treated with contempt for those times that I'm vulnerable.

"There are a [lot](https://www.google.com/search?q=academic+success+based+in+gender&amp;oq=academic+success+based+in+gender&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6859j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) of [academically researched analyses](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=effects+of+gender+on+academic+performance&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJyaeQpN_XAhUs9IMKHRCFARkQgQMIJjAA) that touch on the different aspects of gendered differences in scholastic achievement. Interestingly, the levels of difference in academic success do differ at different ages, in different subjects, and in different cultural frameworks, so it isn't likely some sort of difference inherent to either gender.

One of the common hypotheses is that early self-regulatory behaviors in girls/young women are stronger than those in boys/young men which leads them to be more successful in early years of schooling, but it is likely much more complicated than that with gendered expectations, socioeconomic status, gendered role model/mentoring, pedagogical structures, and more all playing a part. Reading through the research from different cultural groups and ages will give you a much better idea of just how complex the situation is and is really a better representation a simple statement that girls do better than boys in school. There is a lot more nuance than that on a lot of different dimensions."

"How prevalent catcalling/street harassment is (in some places). I still feel like most men I know have absolutely no idea about how frequently a lot of women experience this, and those who do still live in a bit of denial about it.

They literally think they're doing women a service or a favour by shouting obscenities at them!"

He's hot and charming and hot kind and hot and funny and hot and sweet.

I've been single and unlaid for about 8 months and I'm really looking forward to some serious intimacy.

Did I mention that he was hot? Cause he really was. Italian in his early 30s with one of those jobs that makes him a lot of money and gives him a little too much confidence.

And then I walk into the flat he lives in and see 5 filled-to-the-brim garbage bags. And enough non-bagged garbage to fill up at least 5 more. I also get to see a **lot** of stains on some seriously gorgeous carpeting. Further in I get to witness the kitchen sink with one plate with radioactive fungus growing on it to keep company with the 3 other filthy and crusty plates around it. There was also a wonderful fecal smell wafting through the air.

"I didn't even realize I was depressed for the longest time. Just figured I was finally growing up and realizing that life actually sucks and there's nothing to look forward to. I moped around feeling cheated and lied too until one afternoon I was laying in bed at like 4:00pm (still, never got up) and realised ""oh shit, this is depression. I'm depressed"" I was instantly and blazingly fucking PISSED. I cannot quantify the rage that filled me. It was enough that I immediately got up, showered, cleaned my entire house, went to the store and bought $200 in new clothes and then spent the night hanging out with friends eating pizza, drinking beer and laughing. I went to bed feeling so much better.....then woke up like nothing had changed. I was startled at first. I thought I fixed this! And that pissed me off. Cue shower, hitting the gym for the first time in 6 years and cooking myself a 3 course meal of all new recipes that night. I basically bettered my life out of spite. Eventually it all started feeling natural. My improved diet and exercise routine helped my mindset incredibly. I felt great. I feel great.
My co-workers actually tell me regularly how annoying it is I'm always happy. So in a word rage is what got me through it. If things really were shit and life really did suck then I refused to allow myself to be to blame. "

We had a sit down meal (good) but the wait staff kept topping our wine glasses up continuously throughout the meal and entertainment (bad), so didn't really know how much I'd actually had to drink.

We move on to the after-party bar and I'm so wasted that I fall over in the toilet cubicle, went outside for fresh air and wasn't allowed back in to the bar.
So my colleague had to take me home, my parents then pick me up from the station and my mum had to undress me and put me to bed.

Apparently I refused a pyjama top and exclaimed that I would be ""sleeping in my tits!"", which has now become a saying amongst family and friends for sleeping in the nude."

"The all-girls school felt more confortable; less social pressure and better environment for work/study. We were more at ease to be amongst girls. Even having fun was a little less self conscious. But, and it'a a big BUT for me, it was really not a good lesson about how to live in a society. Being sheltered from boys, not learning and growing up with them for a few years, made it more difficult for me to understand them later on. I knew I was missing on something important. When finally I changed school to a mixed one, it was very awkward for me for about two years... but at least I knew I was back in real world. "
"Also just the idea that being ""logical"" in a relationship is somehow superior, helpful, or desirable.

It was a huge scandal. Apparently the second wife knew about the first but was still okay with forming a family what him and helped him lead a double life. Fucking bizarre. When it came time for the funeral the second family (which included dozens of members) were banned from attending. And the oddest part about this? These two families literally lived two miles away with some of his children/grandchildren attending school together without knowing anything. 

Honestly I don‚Äôt know how he managed to lead a double life for decades. Must have been exhausting.  "
"I was raped in a really humiliating way when my boyfriend and I parted ways to try and see other people. When I finally opened up to him about it he held it against me.

"This is big and I don't think it's talked about a lot. If you think about the careers that push people from working to middle class, almost all of the largely female ones (nursing, teaching, administrative work, etc.) require degrees whereas boys can expect to enter a skilled trade with very little pushback. I bet if little girls could expect to be plumbers or electricians things would change a bit."
"As a teacher, I generally think that it is because girls are trained to be more compliant with directions. Among my students at least, I think the girls care more about the teachers' view of them as students whereas boys don't care as much.

Among my students there are both girls and boys who are excelling and failing. However, when it comes to students with disruptive and off-task behaviors, they are almost all boys. The boys also seem much more likely to have IEPs. Don't know if that is because they are just more likely to be diagnosed with learning disabilities, or if they truly have higher incidences of disabilities."

"My grandma wrote a series of notebooks about her childhood from her first memory up until she had kids. I only read the first few because my mom sent them on to my aunt. My grandmas family was horribly poor. She often went without eating, and I'm thinking this might have stunted her growth as she was only about 4'11"".  Her mom slept around a lot and never really took care of the kids well. Her boyfriends would touch the daughters inappropriately and she wouldn't care. My grandma shared shoes with her siblings as they grew out of them, sometimes she would get awful blisters when they didn't fit or she had to go barefoot. We live in northern Wisconsin so the winters are very harsh.  A few of her siblings died when they were kids as well. I can't really remember much else, I read the books right after her death and I was still very emotional. "

You know who uses birth control, motherfucking everyone.. single people, married people, people that don't have partners, people who do, people that have a lot of sex, people that have almost no sex. I guarantee the number of Hobby Lobby exec motherfuckers that use birth control is in the high 90s despite the 'religious reasons' they are claiming.

"Ensure that she knows she does not have to accept being touched unless she has allowed someone to touch her. This is anythign from hugs and kisses (yes even from family members).  Give her bodily autonomy.

Listen to her if she says someone touched her and use language that is clear when talkign about body parts. The words is a two fold detail.  It gives her a sense that she doesn't need to be ashamed about having a vagina (vs callign a nono place or other silly language that makes it sound like it should be shameful or not ever mentioned) it also allows for her to clearly state where she was touched or what happened without any ambiguity if that horrible situation ever presents itself (and we definitely hope she never is in that situation).

Don't demand her to wear dresses but don't refuse to allow her to wear dresses.  Let her take part in pickign out clothes and toys she wants to play with. So what if she wants to dress more like a tomboy? so what if she wants to dress like a princess would you really love her less because of her clothing choices or interests?  no of course not so don't stress over it and expect her to fit a particular type of girl. (in other words don't define what femininity means for her, let her decide that).


Treat her mother the way you would like your daughter's partner to treat her, not just when your daughter is around, but always.  Let her see a healthy relationship even if you two are together or not. That doesn't mean never have arguments, but rather even during an argument treat each other respect and discuss the issue without insulting each other.

Above all stress the fact that you will love her unconditionally.  That doesn't mean she won't ever be in trouble or that you won't always agree with her choices but that you will always love her."
Was your date just like a deep-cover wingman? Because I don't think I could do a better job of talking up any of my buddies than he just seemed to do unconsciously there.
"I've experienced it many subtle and not so subtle forms, though it's never worked.

My favorite story, however, was from my OKCupid days.  Dude messages me this laundry list of ""you cute but""s, insulting my hair, makeup, weight, etc. and telling me what I *must* do to land a man.  My only response was ""does this usually work for you?""  He sent me multiple wall-of-text messages apologizing and gushing about his revelations on how much of an ass he is and asking for another chance.  When I didn't respond within a day he *deleted his whole damn account.*  It was genuinely hysterical.  Also made me wonder why so many dudes think ""if you have this quality, *I* don't like you"" means ""if you have this quality *men as a collective* don't like you.""  Uh, this is a great time to unironically say......NOTALLMEN!  Plenty of dudes love ""skinny"" girls with ""nappy"" hair, so you can fuck right off if that's not your thing (which it obviously actually is, or you wouldn't have messaged me)."

"Treating me like a damsel in distress.

Telling me I look better with/without something. Makeup, for example. ""You look better without make up."" 

Putting others down while trying to compliment. 

Buying gifts as an apology. How about an actual apology where you acknowledge what happened and how it will change so it doesn't happen again? It's insulting when someone tries to placate with a gift.

Unsolicited advice when I'm talking about whatever, as if they know my situation well enough, havent thought about it myself and like I've asked for it. Try listening. 

Not taking no for an answer. I don't mean consent wise.. more like chivalry I guess?? ""I'll pay my bill"" no, allow me. ""Nah, I like to pay for myself."" No, I got it don't worry. ""Okay just don't listen to me I guess."" "
I'm bisexual and my (now ex) boyfriend knew it from the start but any time I brought up an LGBT culture thing that he wasn't familiar with he would get really nasty and go on about how this is the reason LGBT people aren't accepted. It was as if he totally forgot I was bi any time that it didn't relate to something sexual.
"Oddly enough the most backlash I've gotten is from other black women. Apparently I can't be ""woke"" and dating/fucking white men. Don't get me wrong, I understand their flawed logic but obviously I'm not going to engage ANY man who has problematic tendencies. They think that dating black men makes them somehow more socially aware than me &amp; it's laughable honestly. Dating white men doesn't mean I'm only attracted to white men &amp; that's my biggest problem with it all.

I go to a suuuuper white university in the south so it's tough to not end up having experiences with white men just based on statistics. I've never gotten anything negative from stangers or my family (regardless of race). Just my black female friends :("

"Currently pregnant. 

Our local shelter has a thing every year where you can sponsor dogs and cats for the holidays. Buy them things ""the animals request"" like beds, blankets, and toys. Well I REALLY wanted this one big dog because they wrote ""duke would like an orthopedic bed and a stuffed animal. He specially requested a toy duck"" and I wanted him soooo bad. Someone else got him to sponsor and I started crying in the car to my husband because ""I wanted to get the big dog a toy duck! He specifically requested it!""

"Grandma apparently had an illegitimate baby at age 20. She never told anyone in the family as far as anyone knows. She moved to a town about 2 hours away to attend an accelerated nursing program but in reality she was living in a home for ‚Äúgirls in trouble‚Äù where her daughter (‚ÄúSharon‚Äù) was born. We found out because the daughter found us, after getting a copy of her original birth certificate when the laws changed in our state allowing adoptees to get this information.

My mom and I went to the home which is still in existence, now as an education center for unwed and teen moms, and got to see records of Grandma‚Äôs stay there. She was there for six months and gave birth on the premises. After the birth and recovery she moved into a women‚Äôs boarding house and lived there until she met and married my grandfather. I got a copy of Sharon‚Äôs birth certificate so I could research the alleged father since Sharon had been unable to locate him or his family. With the power of the internet I was able to find his family (he has passed as well) and Sharon is now in contact with them.

This explains the reasoning behind why Grandma never took communion at Mass during my mom and her siblings‚Äô lives. (The Catholic faith holds that one must be in a ‚Äústate of grace‚Äù and have confessed your sins.) She had told my mom at one point that she was still working on things between herself and God and she couldn‚Äôt take communion until it was worked out, and would never speak of it again. It appears that she never even told a priest of her pregnancy."
"Anything that ends in ""‚Ä¶for a girl!"" It's an attempt to make women feel special for not ""being like other girls"", but it makes my skin crawl a little bit. I know a lot of guys that genuinely do think that's a huge compliment and don't see the negative side to it. "
"It was my first ""adult job"" at Citifinancial, and they rented out Medieval Times for the holiday party.  We all got two free drink tickets and I decided to try to get the strongest drinks I could think of-Long Island Iced Teas.  I thought I could handle my alcohol, but those were strong.

Long story short, we were all really into cheering for our knight.  I was standing on a chair cheering, and promptly fell right off.  The good thing is only a few sober people seemed to notice or care, most were drunk, and even buying themselves more drinks.  I still think of the eye contact I made with this dude when I was getting up and cringe.  "

"Honestly, there are a *lot* of ways, but I am wary even of articulating them publicly because it usually leads to arguments I‚Äôm not particularly interested in having; for the most part, they never go anywhere and are a waste of my time and energy. 

So, in general I‚Äôll say that I‚Äôm really disappointed in a lot of expressions of feminism that have become popular on social media, particularly on Tumblr. 

I‚Äôm frustrated with a fixation on accepting certain ideas as orthodoxy at risk of severe social censure if one seeks to debate those ideas within a feminist framework. 

I‚Äôm frustrated with just how frequently I see discussions be derailed by assumptions of bad faith, baseless accusations and major overreactions. 

I‚Äôm frustrated by how expressions of trauma or fragility have become an almost necessary price of entry in some circles, and how some ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù circles socially reinforce and validate expressions of fragility that are, frankly, completely unhealthy. 

I‚Äôm frustrated with how it tends to be dominated by more absolutist voices, even when some of their ideas are incredibly flawed or their behaviour flat-out abusive. 

I‚Äôm frustrated with the predominance of a certain liberal feminist outlook that considers itself radical but absolutely bristles whenever it‚Äôs own sacred cows are challenged in an analysis of power. "
"Maybe we're cousins. My great-grandpa bailed on my great-grandma and their 3 kids and just disappeared without a word when my grandpa was very young. Didn't have a clue what happened to him until maybe 8 years ago or so when we found out he started a whole second family in Alabama. One of his grandkids down there was doing genealogy research and found my brother on Facebook, having never known we all existed. This all went down shortly before my grandfather passed away and it actually gave him a lot of comfort to get closure on the whole thing."
"&gt; i'm trash, i'm a monster, you hate me. i can't bear to live with myself

Him: ""Nothing I ever do is good enough for you.""

Me: ""You're right, but you have no one to blame but yourself. Try harder next time.""

The look of shock on his face was hysterical. "
"I used to only date Indian guys with PhDs and read a lot and were ambitious and made a ton of money. Wasn't quite working out for me. 

Went on a rebound with a white guy with only an undergrad degree. On our first date he said 'might confess this anyway, I don't read books very much. I don't mind audio books though'. And he wasn't making that much money either. 

But years before, I'd made a list of things I absolutely wanted in a spouse, and he fulfilled all of them. I wanted conversation to be easy and interesting. It was. I wanted someone emotionally mature who wouldn't play silly games. He was and didn't. I wanted sexual chemistry. There was. And I wanted him to be independent of his family for the most part. He was. And on top of all this, he was crazy smart, very kind and not at all cocky. 

Anyway we went on many many dates and I discovered all this about him. He also stood by me through a very tough time very early on. We're married now. Couldn't be happier.

He makes a lot more money now, and we listen to a lot of audio books together. He's a huge positive influence in my life. "

"I really liked my experience in an all-girls high school in SE Asia. Maybe it was just the circles I hung out in but I pretty much never experienced any cattiness or drama like I seem to hear about from people in the US. There wasn't any pressure on us to be ""ladylike"" or whatever and we got to take both cooking classes and wood shop(?), while I heard in co-ed schools those classes were gender segregated. I feel like in co-ed environments sometimes students tend to segregate themselves based on gender for certain roles (especially for physical labour) but in the girls' school everyone just did what they wanted to do or what they were good at.

One bad side effect though was that socially anxious me completely forgot how to talk to guys after re-entering a co-ed environment. They were like alien creatures. Even now I feel much more comfortable talking to girls than to guys. "

"I learned this only a few years ago, in my early 20s. I think I stopped valuing her opinion, or at least, starting valuing mine more than I valued hers. One specific moment comes to mind, when she came over to see my first apartment after I left home. She expressed dislike towards a piece of furniture, or decor, or something (can't exactly remember what it was). She's very opinionated, so she was probably very expressive about how she didn't like whatever it was. I remember looking at her and saying that I didn't care and that I really liked it (and meaning it!). 

In the grand scheme of things, I stopped seeking her approval gradually, when I matured and became my own woman. It did take a while to accept we wouldn't have the kind of relationship I wanted. I think reflecting on my childhood and on the kind of life my mother had, and continues to have, helped me get there. I realized a lot of things about her that make her a very flawed person. I realized that she just couldn't provide me with what I was looking for. 

I realize you're probably asking this question for a reason. I hope you get there soon, friend. Good luck."
"It's a social conditioning thing. Boys are encouraged to run around and get muddy and rough and tumble. Girls are told to ""act like a lady"" and be polite and quiet."
"I'm baffled by this too. The old-fashioned schools in which boys were supposedly doing so much better had *more* pronounced precisely those features that we've come to label as ""girl-friendly"". Traditional education was first and foremost language-centered: from poetry memorization to composition to translation from Latin/Greek to lengthy and complex canonical reading lists. Not much fussing around with hands-on approach in just about any subject. The classrooms seem to have been structured *exactly* the way that you sit down, shut up, are expected to have the degree of muscular and mental self-control that enables you to focus on extended lectures for many hours a day with minimal breaks. And that you get examined on the precise content (not on the skill application, or your own personal elaboration of the ideas acquired), and are expected to sink-or-swim in that environment.

Sometimes I wonder if we got the problem backwards. If boys, on average, really *were* able to sustain such an environment two or three generations ago, maybe their modern ""unrest"" isn't a manifestation of unique kinesthetic needs nor of a differentiated learning style -- but a product of greater lenience, greater tolerance accorded to their failures at self-regulation. Maybe girls are easier to work with because *they're under a greater formative pressure to behave*, and thus learn the lesson that their individual needs and learning preferences aren't going to be *the* central consideration in a group-learning environment such as a classroom? And that even if the work is boring, and the method unappealing, it still has to be done? Maybe we simply raise them to be more *dutiful* than boys? More *considerate* of the fact that they're in a group setting? Maybe we send girls the message that *they* are to adapt *themselves* to the requirements of the social institution through which we put them, while when boys act out we approach it with an excessively sympathetic ""boys will be boys"" mindset? *And maybe they pick up this attitude?* 

Modern schools need to be different from the traditional ones, yes, because the world has changed. But to say that in their current format they're uniquely hostile to boys, *all while pointing out precisely to those elements of the system that were MORE pronounced in traditional schools*, seems to misdiagnose the problem. With all of this victimist discourse around boys' lesser achievement, has anyone seriously raised a possibility that girls achieve more because they internally experience it as something they *have* to do? Maybe they don't have the psychological *luxury* of not treating school reasonably seriously, because of the messages they get from their teachers and families?

There are probably multiple factors that conspire into this phenomenon. I'm wary of simplistic ""feminist conspiracy, schools were remodeled to suit girls"" type of explanations. There seems to be an entire social layer here that we're not really parsing properly."

When I was a kid, I'd always go with him to the hardware store and he'd get the big lumber cart even when he didn't need one, and I'd ride around on it. He'd pretend he was an airplane pilot making flight announcements when he took me to school (this one has really expanded over the years; 30 years later we still make versions of this joke). He sends me pointless, hilarious junk in a box in the mail to let me know he's thinking of me. He texts me sports play by play for sports he knows I don't follow, and each time pretends to think that I earnestly care about the outcome. I advise him about his (faux) anxiety about saying goodbye to his old worn out house slippers and getting new ones, and he does the same for me and my flip flops. We always made banana bread together when I was a kid, and now we text photos to each other and boast about it when we make it individually. I have tons of these little trivial things and they are the most special things to me about my dad. 


So I guess my advice to a father would be: take time to build a relationship with your daughter, just the two of you. Have your own jokes, rituals, stuff that is separate from your whole family stuff. When your daughter is pushing 40 and waxing sentimental, it'll be that stuff she thinks of most. "
"I think these are more nebulous than some others, but:

--Feeling like I care more/ am doing all the work. Manifests itself in a variety of ways, including me feeling ""crazy"" because I don't know where I stand and me initiating most plans and contact. **I will not beg for someone's time or attention.**

--Taking on the role of ""mother."" I've noticed some women seem to thrive in relationships where they're the the one who has it all together, and their partner is a fumbling buffoon who can't do anything right without her and every now and then he realizes it and buys her flowers. I *hate* this dynamic. I want a partner whom I see as equal, not some overgrown child who needs to be reminded to pick up his boxers. I hate the nagging wife trope, I hate the idea that men are a work in a progress that a woman must ""break in."" **I will not be a surrogate mother.**

-Kids. I don't like them, I've made very conscious decisions to avoid them, and dating someone with children causes resentment on my end. To me, kids are a burden, a time, energy, and money suck; and dating someone with kids is like dealing with all the shitty parts of parenting with few to none of the supposed benefits.

--Dating someone who is separated but not divorced. Never again.

--Some other things that might not be dealbreakers, but would give me great pause: picky eaters (cannot stand the closeminded attitude; I love trying new foods), extrovert, life of the party types (I always end up feeling like I'm a piece of furniture while he's busy trying to make everyone else laugh), retail/blue collar worker (not always the case, but in my experience someone with little ambition or drive)."

"Yes. My dad (father of 4 girls) coached our soccer and basketball teams, helped us with our homework, read to us at night, planted things in the garden with us, talked about boys, sex, birth control, and relationships with us all like we were intelligent adults. He was very very involved and loved us all with his every being. He treated our mother with the utmost respect and love. He was the greatest. When he died (cancer) I was honestly shocked that the world kept spinning. "
"The one scene in ""One Mississippi"" depicting Tig Nortaro when she was a young teen, her mother making her go out and give her grandfather a hug when she didn't want to because he had been molesting her...

Her mothers face goes from anger, then suddenly drops in shock. It was very touching and dramatic. So what you say about listening to your children, it's so right on. "

We took a trip to the Outer Banks earlier this year &amp; I noticed some mild backlash too. He didn‚Äôt though. We usually just laugh at it and move on. Our families and friends don‚Äôt care at all and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs most important. 

However,  I do see a lot of hate for couples like us online though and it‚Äôs mostly from black men. Like, I‚Äôve posted a picture of the two of us on Instagram or Facebook and got messages calling me things like bed wench, slave, gold digger, traitor, coon etc. "

"Agree. Additionally, the ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" comment instead of apologizing for whatever behavior he engaged in that caused the issue.

Not too disturbing but it was shocking for us. We found out after my uncle died that he was married and had a stepson for years. We just thought that she was a friend of his as they never told us they were married and never acted romantic toward each other. My dad and another uncle apparently also found out that my uncle had a recording on his phone where it was him explaining they were only married so her kid could have health insurance.

"Ok.   
So this man has a thing for soft, thick toilet paper. He would be extremely picky and specific. He would spend a long time on the toilet and use an entire roll.   
He loved his toilet paper so much that he would search the internet for discounts, get every coupon he could find from paper ads. He would keep stacks of paper ads everywhere. If I threw out paper ads before he'd gotten to them, he would fish them back out of the paper bin to see if there were coupons. He would even calculate the cost of gas to be able to buy 10 giant packs of super soft super thick luxurious toilet paper as cheaply as possible. Like, a total difference of 5 euros was enough to spend hours on end finding the best deal.   
Once he got his precious packs of TP, he would stack his car completely full, trunk, backseat, passenger side.   
 
Then he would stack them up to his ceiling in his living room and... show them off to friends and brag about the discount.  Not even joking.

Kept it a secret from pretty much everyone so that my grandmother wouldn't find out. Only reason I found out was because my dad's half-sister from the other family contacted me on Facebook. 

Apparently when I was a child we had met her. It's eerie getting a message from a total stranger claiming to be your aunt and having a photo of you and your siblings as a child. 

Grandmother and everyone else who couldn't know have passed away so my dad and her have met up again now and are trying to reconcile and be friends. Happy ending I guess?"

Thinking they are being 'nice' by dismissing your 'mood' as 'just being on your period'. 
"Thinking that by being nice to me that automatically means I owe them anything. 

I don't care if you listen to me when I had a bad day/bought me dinner or drinks/whatever else. I have female friends that do that, too. You know why they do it? Becuase they give a damn about me and just want to see me be well. Just like I would do for them, or you. Just because you do these things doesn't mean I owe you romantic anything. And it feels really disgusting and hurtful when it comes out that that's the only reason they're doing these nice things for you."
"&gt; and of course, when they throw a fit because something you said hurts their feelings (which is often for being so above it all), they're not being emotional. they're having a perfectly logical reaction/rebuttal to a stimulus.

"I'm so sorry, but I'm glad to see he has a loving partner to support him. 

I remember my college roommate talking about how his biological father was so horribly abusive to his mother that up to eight years after the father had been arrested (for a completely different crime), and two years into his mom's second marriage, his mother still jumps or cowers at the sound of men yelling even when it's just him and his stepfather cheering because of a game on the TV.

"Kids used to be a dealbreaker for me. Then two things happened: one is that I worked as a nanny for a long time, and the other is that I got a bit older.

Once I was over 25 I realized that the guys I was dating my age and older who had kids were no longer deadbeat teen pregnancy dads, but usually men who had been divorced or widowed with kids they loved and wanted. I never wanted bio kids myself, but realized I was fine dating a parent after all."
"I'm surprised there's so many people saying that no one says anything to them.  I'm a white woman in a relationship with a black man, so I'm speaking from the perspective of someone hearing negative sentiments about others or hearing stories from friends, but I've definitely seen backlash.  I'm basing the following response on things I've witnessed (but not directly experienced) and things I've had my friends in wm/bw relationships tell me.

It seems to me like black and white people make different kinds of comments about these relationships.  Black people will say things directly to the black woman, but rarely to the white man (although, if they are close with the white man, they may make some comments to his face as well).  These comments tend to be played off as jokes, but I don't think they're really jokes.  The most common negative thing I've heard is ""sleeping with the slave master,"" but I've also heard people make jokes about white men having smaller dicks, about black women being ""too much"" for black men, or about black women being ""over the bullshit of black men"" etc.  These sentiments have been made by both men and women in my presence, though the last one (about black men's bullshit) I've only heard from women.

From white men and white women, I usually hear the explicitly racist shit about ""black women not being as pretty,"" or ""black women are crazy,"" or things that they know are flat out racist.  In these cases, white people will talk shit behind the couple's back and never say anything to their face (they'd be more likely to say these sentiments in front of me than to the couple - even knowing I was in an interracial relationship).  I've also noticed that white men tend to comment more on the sexual aspect of the relationship, while white women comment more generally on the relationship as a whole.  I've also heard white men fetishize black women's sexuality in ways that they see as positive, but which are still fetishizations (is that the word?).

Tbh, all of these sentiments - regardless of if they're said by black or white people, regardless if they're said to someone's face or not - can be hurtful.  From everyone else's comments here so far, it seems like maybe people aren't saying these things directly to the couple as much as I thought, but I do think these sentiments still exist heavily.  Or maybe the area I'm from and the racial issues that exist where I'm from are just different so people say some of this stuff more?

Either way, it's interesting to hear other peoples' perspectives.  I hope I didn't step on any toes by jumping into a discussion with a second-hand response."
Eek...not long.  Its a scary mess in my mind and I know that so I only say out loud about 8% of what I think.  
"Back-story - ex went out drinking with friends, came home at midnight to tell me he and his buddies were going a city over to play video games and hang 'cause his friends wife was out of town.

We'd been having a rough time, one of my issues was we didn't have enough quality time with just us, we were always doing stuff in groups. He had promised me that the following day we'd have a day hanging out just us.

I reminded him of our plans, told him that if he went he'd be bailing on our plans. He said no he wouldn't he'd drive back that night or come back early in the morning. I told him I didn't want him driving late after being up all night, and I wouldn't have a fun day if he was tired from being up the whole night.

In the end his friends called to say their girlfriends wouldn't let them go over.

He ended up going on a rant about how his friends are boring because they always hang out with their wives/girlfriends instead... It was like, this big eye opener moment for me. That like... for him, a night in with his GF was a 'boring' thing to do."
"Well my (now) ex lowered his for me and it was a disaster. I thought we were on the same level going into the relationship but he revealed to me over the years how he really felt and it was obvious he resented his choice in deciding to be my boyfriend. My self-esteem took a nosedive and years later I still cry about it all. Basically don't date someone you're - not attracted to, not compatible with, not financially satisfied with and a LOT of feelings will be spared."

"My sister is very autistic and not sexually active. She is a virgin.  Looking at her or speaking to her, you would think she is about 14. 

But she is 18 almost 19 now and recently started going to doctors appointments alone (my mom drives her but waits in the waiting room). She told my mom that her doctors/nurses 'treat her like a s*ut' (her words) for wanting birth control. That she will be trying to explain that birth control helps her not bleed excessively, etc and they act dismissive of her and make little remarks about how they 'know it's just for sex'. 

My sister has been hospitalized before, more than once, because she is already very small/sickly and bleeding heavily for 1-2 weeks during her period pushes her body over the edge. She also gets ovarian cysts. Taking birth control regulates her better so she isn't in terrible pain at least once a month. 

This kind of shit infuriates me. "
"Well....I had this really sweet guy kinda coerce me into making out on his couch after hanging out at the local bar. I was in a really bad spot mentally at the time, so I let it go too far and he started eating me out (with my consent).

So right in the middle of him going to town like a champ, he looks me right in the eye and says ""I love you"".

My sobs were so loud, my husband rushed into the room, thinking something was seriously wrong and I just gasped back: ""The...puppy...was lost.. but...he made it HOME.""

"Oh god. People still talk about that night. It was my boyfriends about 5 years ago. Over the years he said the parties became less and less formal as the economy tanked and traditional holiday parties became a thing of the past due to liability (drunk people). So the year I went it was held at a shitty bowling alley somewhere in southern Indiana. We. Had. A. Blast. 

Buuuuuut I got super drunk and heated about a game with some guy he worked with so the guy got mad and kicked the ball rack breaking his toe in the process. A few of us had to be dragged out to the limo someone had rented to drop us off at the hotel. 3 of the 8 of us puked in it. 

When we got back to the hotel some of the couples decided to swing. My boyfriend and I were invited but we thought they were kidding. We showed up to the room (giggling the entire length of the hotel hallway) and 4 people were in the act. We didn't want to be rude so we stood awkwardly in the corner for a few minutes stifling more laughter. We eventually just sort of backed out. 

He and I broke into the closed hotel pool and swam in our underwear. We tried to be quiet. We were not quiet. Eventually someone kicked us out. We walked back to our room and tried to have sex but we both fell asleep while he was inside me.

It was a little bit of a shock initially to have them over at parties but now it's not a big deal. It's just a big Chinese group with a little Swedish flair now. "
Wow! You drop this dead weight. That's how you handle it. Give yourself time to heal away from such a pathetic excuse for a human being. Please take care of yourself. 
"All the double standards. 

For example, that if a man sleeps with a lot of people he's a stud, but if a woman does the same thing she's a slut."
"I‚Äôm pregnant right now. I could probably write a novel  about all the things that have made me cry. Most recently I ate too many sour patch kids, and got a stomach ache. I cried because I knew it was my own fault but I still wanted more sour patch kids. I figured if I couldn‚Äôt control myself around candy I would never be mature enough to raise a baby. "
I just got the bug chills after reading that. 
"I can't stand the ""well, actually..."" or ""not everyone in xyz group does that"" comments. If someone made a general statement or talked about their own personal experience, there's no reason for you to immediately shit on it because one time that didn't happen the you.

In real life a couple months ago, I stood up for a girl who politely asked a guy not to tell her to smile. We both calmly explained that it happens to us all the time and it gets really grating and makes us self-conscious. He then went around asking every woman around us if it bothered them until one person timidly said no. He used that one example to completely disregard all of our experiences. It was like Reddit IRL.

That being said, there's a way to talk about contrary feelings and experiences that's not dismissive. But that's a level of emotional maturity that the internet may never achieve."
"* Greatly reduced my red meat consumption. I'll eat it on very special occasions (because beef is delicious, let's be real), but only then.  
* Stopped buying mammal meat at the grocery store.  
* I've been using a menstrual cup exclusively for the past 10 years. I keep pads on hand for guests and for emergencies, but I haven't bought anything for my period in years.  
* Reusable grocery bags and produce bags, obvi.  
* I love to cook and hate wasting food, so I'll make Fridge Velcro meals. I'm eating roasted red pepper soup with leftover paprikash onions right now, and last week I made what we call ""kibble"" - ground turkey with whatever veggies are kicking around in the fridge with soy sauce, rice vinegar, and gochujang/sriracha.  
* Flush less often. I grew up in Los Angeles with water shortages. If no one else is home and it's just pee (and it's not Stinky Morning Pee), I won't flush. I have just shared one of my deepest secrets on Reddit, you're welcome.  
* Shave less often. It's winter, who cares if my legs are hairy!  
* I'll scavenge food from school events. One time we got box lunches for an event and my classmates were going to throw their apples out. I took them home and made apple cake and chopped up the rest for the freezer! I'll make apple butter with them for the holidays.  
* When I run out of bagged tea, I'll be switching to looseleaf tea exclusively.  
* I make and bring my own lunches to work in reusable lunch boxes and plastic containers.  
* Clothing swap parties. All the fun of shopping and giving gifts with none of the consumerism.
  
I'm sure there's more, but this is what I've got off the top of my head.

"I‚Äôm 46. I don‚Äôt find cluelessness endearing anymore. As an adult man, you should by now have figured out how to dress and basic manners and courtesy. I‚Äôm not going to think for you or teach you to be a human being. "
"Tangentially related, these things can be pretty difficult for those of us with mental health issues. However, there's a huge difference between having difficulty and making an effort, and having difficulty but not giving a shit. I wouldn't date another person with ADHD if they weren't trying to improve staying on top of these things when I've worked really hard to do the same."
"You do not own her. When she is a baby/toddler/child, of course it's your job to make rules about what's good for her, but she is not your property.

Also it's creepy when fathers try to act like gatekeepers of their daughters' virginity. "
"I went to an all-girls high school my last two years of high school and LOVED it. Loved the community, the intellectual rigor, the nature of the small classes. I am an independent person who really thrives in small communities, and it was great for that. I made my best friend of 17 years there, and still vacation yearly with some of my girls. 

I went to a women's college in part because of that experience, but it was much less of a positive experience. I just didn't find a close community of women there, and since it was much larger, we were all kind of on our own. I also had my own things that had nothing to do with being a women's college, it just wasn't the right evironment for me. 

I transferred into a small selective program within a large middling state co-ed school. I had no issues academically with the transition, other than being super bored with my Gen Ed classes.

I loved that girl school evironments let your academic curioisity fly. It made me totally unafraid of talking out, sharing my opinion, etc.

Now that I'm 18 years out though, there are some things I'm not sure were great. Both my best friend and I have divorced, and both of our previous relationships had a lot of issues. I think there's some initial and important dating skills that we didn't get in high school. I didn't know how to really evaluate men, if that makes sense? It was so haphazard... Some guy would stumble into the girls school community and would like me, and that was good enough for me. I didn't get to know men in their own environment, see them be idiots in class, etc. So for a lot of my early adult life I dated people who were just there and expressed interest. And I would keep men around for a long time just because I didn't know how to have expectations. I don't know if that was girls school fault, but I think not having men around made it harder to develop these skills. 

And now I primarily date women, problem solved! I never did in girls school though."
"Chips and salsa, man. Gets me every time. Doesn't even have to be good chips and salsa."
"Well, he truthfully didn't need to be going after anyone, anyway. He was engaged. And then after his car was retrieved, shit hit the fan. Because it was found out that it was his side chick, who he had knocked up. And she stole his car because he told her that he wasn't going to leave his fiance and two kids for her. But his fiance knew it was going to happen and gave permission for it to happen! Not as payback or anything like that for knocking up this other chick. But as a pay off to this other chick to GTFO of their lives. And the damn fiance stayed with him. It was like a damn episode of Jerry Springer happening. And it was made worse by the fact that this dude thought he was God's gift to women and that we owed him something or some shit. It was aweful. *HE* was aweful."
"Balancing the...you're the woman, so you do this stuff. I'm the man so I do this stuff....but you want equality so here do some more of my stuff so you can feel equal...but I'm not going to help with your stuff cuz that's women's work. 

That. And crazy fucking eyebrow trends. "

"Should've just agreed with them. ""Yes, I agree, if someone deserves to talk to me they will text me first"" and then you'd never need to talk to them again."
Hands. I LOVE hands. The weird sausage fingers and fat hands dont do it for me. I enjoy slightly longer fingers with a square shaped palm. Kind muscular hands. Just something so manly about certain hands. When I find hands I like I cant stop thinking about them running their hands all over my body. 
Learn how to sew so you can repair clothes you already have instead of buying new ones if something develops a tear or a hole. Frozen vegetables and fruit have the same nutritional value but last longer and are generally a lot cheaper.

"I don't know about insufferable, but could you imagine the weird shit kurt cobain or michael Jackson would have tweeted about?"
"I told myself I want ever going to date long distance ever again, but I broke that rule. I think it helped that we set guidelines to close the gap instead of just meandering around waiting. "
Um.  You can be Native American and still be from Mexico.
"Sorta relevant, Iceland is such a small place they need an app to tell if your potential partner is actually a relative!"
"Racism, homophobia, transphobia, people talking about the relationship/sexual preferences of others in an overly negative way (i don't need everyone to be into BDSM or polyamory, but don't yuck someone else's yum and all that)."
"I think when Harry Met Sally. Their friendship feels very real and the events leading up to their relationship feel believable. Plus it has one of my favourite scenes in a romance movie - Harry and Sally are fighting and the fight escalates really quickly with lots of yelling. Sally pauses after saying her piece and Harry says ""are you finished?"" And she nods or whatever and then he just gives a very sincere apology and they hug and stuff.

I just think it's great. It just perfectly illustrates how sometimes we get angry with the people we love and we say things we shouldn't but because we love them we are willing to apologize and move on. "
"I live in a town with very low crime rate, basically nonexistent murder rates (we have had like 3 in the past 15 years), and I absolutely hate that I feel unsafe jogging on the sidewalks that they installed near my house a few years ago. The sidewalks go through four streets where there is a lot of traffic. I get harassed and catcalled more there than anywhere else I have ever been. Every. Single. Run. will result in honking, catcalling, shouting.... 

I have had someone circle around multiple times to tell me how they want to f*ck me, then try to block me when I attempted to run to a parking lot. That guy almost got pepper sprayed in the eyes, but he drove away when he saw it. When I was younger and living in the same area, I had a guy stalk me for weeks every time I walked home from school and one day he tried to rape me. I was 13.   

The 'good ol boys' are the worst offenders. Almost every single person doing the things mentioned above was driving a pick up truck.

I work in a city nearby and I never get harassed when I go walking around work. 

I seriously cannot understand how men think what they are doing is 'okay' or 'appreciated'. Making me too afraid to go jogging near my own fucking house is not 'appreciated'.

"Are you me? I hadn‚Äôt even been dating this guy for two years when we talked about when would be a good time to get married. I said I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable until we‚Äôd dated for at least 3 years, and he was incredulous. He kept asking if he proposed right then, would I say yes, and got really upset when I told him I‚Äôd say no. He later got drunk and told me that he would‚Äôve proposed by the end of the year if I hadn‚Äôt insisted on waiting. I was like, are you fucking kidding me??? We were living with his parents (which he said was normal for the first few years of being married - I said fuck that!), we were both in undergrad, I was in a program of study that practically ensured the need for grad school and he expected me to be a SAHM for five years because that was what his mom did, and he had some crazy double standards in that when I turned 21 before he did, he worried that I‚Äôd be an alcoholic because I had access to alcohol and he wanted to make a lifetime commitment to me when he wasn‚Äôt even 21 yet himself! 

I swear, he just saw me as a future wife because he wanted to be all grown-up without actually considering me as a partner with my own ideas of how my life should go. He literally told me that he wanted to be engaged so other people would take our relationship more seriously when he introduced me as his fianc√©. I dodged a bullet when I dumped his ass a couple months later. "
"The Before Trilogy. Specifically the last movie, Before Midnight. "
"I support them. Hell, I *make* them.

I think that, of all the things to get upset and offended about, jokes about us not knowing how to season our food or not being able to dance or not getting arrested even when we break the fucking law are pretty high up on the ""why are you even mad about this"" scale.

I also look at them as little reminders to check myself and make sure I'm not getting too...self-congratulatory."
