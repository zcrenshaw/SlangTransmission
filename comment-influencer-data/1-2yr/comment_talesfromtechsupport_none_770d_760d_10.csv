"Good grief, I'd be delighted if my 1986 computer were still working usefully long enough to be struck by lightning. "
Good boss
"Tech support must suck, but it probably sucks a bit less with a boss like that."
"When I read the title, I was expecting him to just have unplugged the fans, and it was overheating because of that. Holy hell..."
Maybe she just wants your attention ;)
I'M NOT GETTING WHAT I WANT IMMEDIATELY WHEN I WANT IT SO YOU'RE A LIAR
I use cases like these to justify to customers why their server rooms need access control.
Just when you think you have read it all tfts comes at you with something unexpected. 
"Well done. Seriously, that is some fantastic tech support right there.

Virtual beers are on me!"
"Had a similar issue myself.

They kept having USB cash drawers stop responding. Saw it happen, and at the same time an iTunes notice popped up on the point of sale.

For whatever reason, plugging in a phone was killing their other USB devices."
"why would you sell me a machine that will be obsolete sometime in the distant future????? That's how I would've responded. 

Kidding aside, I wonder why you would be angry about upgrading your system, if someone told me it was that old id say well i guess its about time i did have an upgrade and thank you for pointing that out. "
works usefully as a paper weight
so you of course posted it here like a good tech. lol
Sounds like you have a lot of shitty admins at &lt;company&gt;...
BUT DID IT?!?!
"Deal with troublesome customers

LIKE A BAWS"
"I am absolutely expecting a TFTS post titled, ""Angry Customer Didn't Call, Yelled At Me For Lying On Phone."""
"Spoilers, it worked"
"Yes, it is an [interrobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang)!"
"Think it depends where you work and the type of industry because I work in Tech support and it's the most enjoyable job I've ever had thus far.

I work in technical support for one of the largest manufacturers of alarm systems in Africa and our policy states that we do not engage with End users (That's for our distributors to worry about) 

Only certified Alarm Installers can contact us and in the 6+ Months I've been in my current position I've only ever had to deal with 3ish ass holes, Most of the people who call are either friendly or just straight to the point but very rarely are they rude.

Edit: Spelling"
We keep those reboots as slow as possible so more folks call us to find out how long it will take. We get so very lonely here in the server room.
I can thankfully say that this is the weirdest thing I've seen happen to a PC that I built.
"I am one of today's lucky 10,000. "
lol I manage a business and something like this happened the other day where a customer called and had a ridiculous made up complaint and I just hung up on the woman after telling her I had no interest in continuing to speak to her. She called back and I just hung up on her again. Was pretty funny.
"&gt;Did you try licking it sir?

This is going to be my go-to phrase for problems I couldn't solve from now on."
"I was thinking this, especially by how she said thanks. You're in there OP!"
…and possibly count from zero to zero‽
You found one of the rare gems of people that actually realizes the error that they made and takes ownership of it rather than deflecting. 
"Oh this is customer's admins. As in, our customers can use this web GUI to administrate their own companys subscriptions."
"I hate users like this. My company is Russian owned. Half in the Ukraine, basically all the developers and some data entry clerks. And the other half with me in one of two buildings in the USA. Literally 3 miles from each other.

I've had so many customers bitch about ""the outsourced Russians"" they spoke to. The guy they bitch about sits right next to me. He is a citizen. And none of our Ukraine team answers phones. I've explained this to the same people every time and it's annoying as donkey balls.

Stupid people make me face desk too much.

Side note: the Russians in our company are cool as shit. Just... don't piss them off."
"this is one of those ""fix it now and never speak of this again"" moments"
"If you plan perfectly and make a reusable tool, the lost time's worth it. For example, if they did form a system that they could use to run any vbscript in all computers at login, that is great, it's worth the time. *(Don't get me wrong, why would a system administrator have a hard time forcing all computers to run something after their next login, I have no idea. But I have no idea about your rollout mechanism of course)*

But.. I don't think that's the case here."
"Sometimes, bosses don't have your back, and gladly throw you to the lions in order to appease the customer.

Other times, bosses *do* have your back, and it's absolutely glorious."
Good bot
Simple solution: lock up the usb ports.
"Could have been worse.

&gt;""The sound isn't working""

"Patch notes: ""Fixed a rare issue affecting some users that caused incorrect data to be displayed in the data usage reporting tool."""
"Is....

Is that character at the end *both* a question mark and an exclamation point....?"
I have a shovel and a little spare time.
"Wait. There are companies that don't have access control? Even if it's a simple key, and not an electronic one? 

In our new building, the access sensor thingy (Technical word) wasn't fully setup, and people would walk in to the comms room, and just grab equipment without any of us noticing (more so in the room where we're not close to) 

Any how, I was pretty glad when the sensor thingy started working again"
Now that's what you call a power user!
"as soon as he got to the part where he was dialing into an unconfigured modem i was like 'damn, son, they don't pay you enough'"
"A lot of people seems to take the phrase ""customer is king"" literally.

They tend to forget that throughout history, bad kings most of the time were assassinated..."
I have a lot more free time with calls like this.
"I helped someone pick out a new system over irc just when AMD released Athlon 64 for socket 754.  
He wanted the best which was the 3400+ then iirc, which was quite pricey. Got a pretty decent rig for not an insane amount considering everything was the latest hardware.  
He had never built a computer though, but had a friend who could help. I suggested getting a store to build it, but no, it was cheaper to do it yourself.  
I gave him some links to guides on how to build, and pointed out that the motherboard manual and case manuals would give lots of information as well.

Perhaps a week later I get a message on irc from the guy asking if there was anything that could be done to fix the new computer. Apparantly he, or the friend, managed to miss opening the locking arm on the socket and just put the CPU on top. When the heatsink couldn't be attached they just used more force until they heard a crunching noise. All the pins on the CPU were bent or broken."
"That is an awesome story.     
Not only because it shows that a) good bosses are out there, but b) the kind of loyalty it inspires.      
Also: I bet your boss was in high spirits after this for at least a week. That is the kind of shit you *dream* of doing. ""I AM the boss, you tit! Muwahahahahaha!""."
I AM GOING TO ~~HANG UP~~ LEAVE CHAT NOW!
"""I'm sorry Sir but if you're not going to cooperate and lick it I'll have to hang up"""
"That's why instead of getting a larger engine in my car, I got a second windshield installed. more go juice."
With a lot of epoxy.
"He should have come personally and read the note to the owner, then bonk him in the head a couple times and re-read when he didn't listen.

It's the $CustomPCBuilder's fault, clearly."
"Were I that builder, that notice would be either covering IO or power button, just saying."
oookay anyone else think was going somewhere way farther away then a bios update and a couple of processors?
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the english way
"Colleague of mine once said: ""People leave bosses, not companies."""
$$$
"I mean, I probably won't ever disagree with that."
"Lots (almost all, in my experience) of SMBs take the ""janitor's mop closet"" approach to centralized IT. That is, dedicated square footage costs money. Access controls cost money. IT costs money. So do everything in your power to buy as cheap as possible and stuff it into whatever closet happens to have a power outlet. If you're lucky enough to get a door with a lock, it's dead certain that there will be at least two people with keys who either shouldn't have them or have no problem granting access to anyone who asks."

"I grabbed the headset, AND THREW IT ON THE GROUND!

NO YOU CAN'T SPEAK WITH. MY. MANAGER! I AIN'T GONNA BE PART OF YOUR SYSTEM!"
"She wants him to crash his spindle into her jig, if you know what I mean."
"Asked a coworker if she knew what an interrobang was, got reported for sexual harassment. "
Business customers need special settings on the router to connect to the Network and thier servers. And many business class devices really delete everything when you reset them. Home type routers usually have a standard config loaded so you can't screw it up.
"&gt;He was super embarrassed and asked me to not submit the invoice with too descriptive of wording as to the problem.

So much this. A customer had to pay me close to $500 to drive across the state and plug in a cable. Of course I called first and they had ""triple checked all the cables."" She requested that I write up the ticket so it ""looks like you repaired something technical."" I wrote something along the lines of: ""AC power converter was not providing correct voltage to printer (0 volts). Cleaned and re-seated power connectors. Resumed normal operation""  These days I ask them to physically unplug and re-plug everything before I come out.

"Whenever I have to shut down an unresponsive piece of tech by holding it's power button down for several seconds until it gives up the ghost, I have this scene playing in my head of me holding a pillow over its face while I say ""Shh, just go to sleep now."""
*he should give her the D:\
"Oh god this is just like every single one of our clients with old Nortel SL-1 systems who asks ""why can't I get advanced VOIP function XYZ?"" and the only reply we can give is ""because your 35+ years old system wasn't made to be compatible with functionality that wasn't even thought of when you bought it brand new in 1979"""
You've gotta be careful with girls like that. They act like they want the whole D:\ but all they're really after is your cache.
"&gt;He swore he would never do that again.

Five minutes later..."
