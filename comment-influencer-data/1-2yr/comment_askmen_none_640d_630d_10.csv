Take her on a date to the zoo. And leave her there with the other animals. That's where she belongs.
"OK, Not many of the people near me have the internet so I feel relatively safe. If for some reason I'm rolled because of this post and you figure out who I am I will kill you in your sleep if you say anything.

There is a guy I know. He is 61 with an IQ in the 50s (or something).  Before his dad died he did a good job of setting him up. Meal on wheels feeds him. A maid comes over and cleans twice a week, he has a social group that meets up and goes do stuff and he has a wall of phone numbers he can ring if something goes wrong. Because of my criminal past, his dad came to me with a very different way to help. See, the guy still believes in Santa. So for the last 7 years I've been breaking into his house every Christmas eve and making sure Santa leaves him a god dam present."
"I've gotten ""You're Indian. Ew"". 

Don't let it get to you, people can be idiots. "
"Are you me? I read this advise on Reddit a long time ago: find a conference room and a box of paperclips. Throw the paperclips on the floor, close the door, and sleep with your feet up against the door. If someone opens the door, it will bump your feet and wake you up and you can pretend to be picking up the paperclips."
Bruh honestly what did you expect? Are you really shocked to hear that people using hook up apps *hook up with other folks*?
"The answers you’re going to get here are going to be indicative of what reddit thinks. Talk to people you care about who share your values. 

Ask yourself if it’s a deal breaker or not. You get to decide who you want to be with. If you are gonna be with her you’ll have to move past it. Up to you either way. "
"whoa whoa whoa whoa wait WHAT?

oh man that's an unfortunate typo."
Wow my boyfriend does this too OP let’s run off together tbh
"
*  ***Get a child custody lawyer ASAP*** and talk to him about your situation and future legal recourse .

* If you have any proof  about her cheating ,then keep it safe . Even though you are not married , it can be still helpful in future to have some proof 

* Deactivate any form of joint/shared bank accounts , Credit card , Debit card . Ensure that she has no access to any of your personal financial wealth which she can spend and leave you in a fucked up situation 

* If she knows your passwords or security pin to credit card /Debit card / facebook/gmail / any account - change it immediately

* Change your mailing box to a secure location to ensure that important documents and letters meant for you do not fall in her hands.

* Cease sharing a bedroom with her immediately. Do not risk a false sexual harassment lawsuit in future from a vindictive ex 
"
"Know how she takes her coffee or tea, and make it for her in the morning.

Tell her she looks nice, even when she looks like a truck after she wakes up in the morning.

Schedule a time when its just the two of you. And hold yourselves to it.

Take one day a week, and go out of your way to do something beyond your responsibilities or chores (IE - Also vacuum the living room one day)

Buy her flowers every couple of months. Not for a specific reason, just do it.

Explore her interests with her? She likes books? Go to an old book store together.

Find a hobby that you both enjoy, and then spend a weekend doing it. My wife an I do brewery tours.

Find a tradition, and expand on it. We also have a pair of glasses from every brewery.

Learn to cook. It's not as hard as you think, and she will appreciate coming home to a meal.

To touch on above, at first the meal may not taste so good, but she will be happier that you're trying and learning than anything. Trust me, I speak from experience.

Listen. Just fucking listen.

Tell her when you're frustrated with something, let her support you sometimes. I tell my wife (Yes, the phrasing is intentional for both of us, because we are 12) ""I'm going to spew now"" - and just word vomit. Exposure is scary, but brings you closer together.

Laugh at the farting noises during sex.

Find new experiences together - go to a painting and wine night, try a co-op cooking class, go to a high elevation ropes course.

Be silly, make funny faces.

Leave notes around the house for her to find, just little subtle reminders.

Let her fail. She has to know you're there for her, but that she can still grow and take care of herself. But comfort her when she does.

Let her comfort you when YOU fail. Helping others is a powerful emotion.

Advocate together. Find something that is important to the both of you, and volunteer together.

Know that her mother will never change. Just keep your mouth shut in most cases and deal with it.

Hang out with her dad, bonus points if he's super cool and you share interests. (Thank god for baseball)

Take a vacation every year together. Even if its a stay-cation. Close the doors, turn off your phones, drink some wine, and just enjoy being close.

Read together, or listen to Audible. Find the comfy spot, cuddle up, and even if its two different books, just enjoy being close and nearby the other.

Remind her of the amazing days you've had with gestures, ask her to dance to the wedding song while spinning around the kitchen. Or go to the places you proposed and make new and MORE memories with great spaces.

Incorporate her friends. Ask all of them to supper. Listen to them and their interests. It's about her and them tonight. She will reciprocate.

Have separate hobbies too, and encourage her to experience them. Do the same for yourself. You have to be apart once in a while.

Visit her at work for a lunch date, ""Just because"" - even if its PB&amp;J sandwiches you made at work yourself.

Make the bed every morning, even if you're late. That two minutes that day is far less important than what that will do for her every day when she comes home and sees you have done that.

Scratch her back. When you're watching TV, pop her bra strap, and simply scratch her back. Nothing more, just that itchy feeling is terrible. Bonus points if she has long hair.

Don't always defer to her. Make decisions, stand up for yourself, but know that its important to be open and compromise.

Don't ever, EVER yell at her. We're big and scary. Take two deep breaths, tell her you need to do so, and say that you're taking a moment.

And lastly, and perhaps most important: Touch her. When you walk past, run your hand across her back. Pinch her butt when she's looking in the fridge. Run your hand up and down her back when she lays her head on your chest. Run your hand down her arm when you get out of bed. Kiss her forehead when you walk by. Spoon her right as you climb into bed, then hold her hand. Rest your hand on her leg when you're watching tv. Run your fingers through her hair. Do all of these things.

And I almost forgot: The last thing she should hear you say before you leave, before she leaves, before you fall asleep, as you hang up the phone, even after a fight, or before she goes to bed while you're playing Super Mario Maker, should always be: ""I love you.""

Let that be the last thing she hears always. So in case anything terrible ever happened, she can hold your love and those words in her heart."
"""Which of my friends is the most attractive?"" 

""If you could change one thing about me, what would it be?""

Nice try, not falling for that again."
"I recently got, ""I don't want to ruin our friendship""

which is valid. If not for the fact she refuses to remain friends because ""it'll be awkward."" 


"
"I'm faster at work than I let on.

I keep that secret because hard workers on get worked harder and I don't feed my kids with ""At a boys"""
"She gives way way too much detail about every story. Coworker forgot to send her a necessary file? 10 minutes of backstory on said coworker's work history and normal habits, what the person who did the job before would do, a full detailing of any email correspondence, etc.

I love her to bits so I mostly listen, but there's usually a point in each story where she's already relayed the main points but I realize there's about five more minutes of unnecessary details and I start to check out... "
"She loads the dishwasher like an asshole.

Pans on top, plates diagonal, 20 spoons in one utensil holder--it's like she was born in a god damn cave."
Communicate. I find that pillow talk is the easiest time for us. Well just lay in bed and talk about stuff.
"My ex was a very clean girl, but no matter what she radiated a stink from down there. She would sleep naked all the time and it would fill up underneath the blanket and just start attacking my nose. I loved her, but i could never get the courage to tell her anything. She left me for someone else though so i hope he cant sleep at night because of the smell!"
"Exterminator. They will have the gear to protect themselves from the wasps, whereas the guitar shop will not. And if the guy that works on the guitar turns out to be allergic to wasps, it will not end well.

I'm almost certain that you can't be serious, but I just like being logical."
"Most annoying rejection... was probably when she lost interest after I got her off through foreplay.


As to your situation... dude, I'm six feet tall, and I've been called short.


In my experience, ""tall"" means the tallest two guys in the room. Everyone else is short."
Maybe you shouldn't try to date your daughter.
"Married a Brit...

"Yarp. 

OP, you are no longer in a relationship. You just entered the fuckin thunderdome. Every action from now on is an act of survival until you can get free. Listen to this agent’s advice. He may not be 47 but he knows his bidness. "
The milk drinkers shall rise!
"I have a close friend who gets paid to do cam shows. From what I've seen, about everyone that has offered to pay for a show is someone that's obviously too shy or awkward irl to get any female interaction. It seems like they fill that void by paying a chick online to treat them nicely and be attracted to them. One of the viewers even started calling the shows ""dates"", so you can imagine the much bigger problems these dudes have."
You'll be fine Mr. Hart.
"Pillow talk has to be my favorite part of being in a relationship. After those sexual urges are gone, I'm calm, relaxed, and laying in bed with my favorite person in the world. It's intimate even though it is sometimes just random talks. I miss it."
She continually leaves cabinet doors and drawers open. I'll walk into the kitchen and three drawers will be open and five doors ajar. Is it that much effort to shut that shit? Drives me insane.
...so your friend fucking sat in the driveway in his van while you all went inside? What the fuck? That's even worse.
"5'3"" Indian guy here, the relevance of the post and top comment is incredible lol"
"That’s peculiar. Even at 5’6, I’ve never felt any animosity towards my height. 

I have been rejected for being black, though. Multiple times. "
She commutes an hour to and from work and gets in late. Sometimes if I know she's stressed I'll have a warm bath ready for her when she gets home and get dinner ready while she soaks.
"I go to a lot of concerts and I'll typically buy two tickets right away/during pre-sale.  

Usually one of my best friends will buy one of the tickets off me and we'll go together. If he can't go, but I can still go/want to go, I typically hit up a friend or a girl I'm seeing and tell them I won an extra ticket to the show and want to bring them with. I've been doing this for a few years and it's been a fun way to show my friends a good time. 

The only person who knows this is my buddy who usually buys the extra ticket. Everyone else just thinks I'm a lucky bastard at winning concert tickets. "

"This is kind of a long story, but I always find it funny.

I was at a bar with two of my bandmates, my drummer (Danny) and singer (John). We were just hanging out and having a few drinks one night after rehearsal and this chick just sat down next to me and started talking to me for a bit, then she noticed my guitar case sitting on the ground next to me. She said ""Oh, you play guitar? I'm sorry, but I only date drummers"". At this exact moment, Danny spins his head almost a full 180-degrees like a fucking owl and looks right at her. I just said ""Sorry, I don't know any drummers"". The chick said ""Okay"" and walked away. Danny was fucking pissed, and John and I almost pissed ourselves laughing. We still give Danny shit about it to this day."
"She's going to have been ploughed by guys before you met her. She's on a hookup app. She's down to hook up. You were on a hook up app, you were down to hook up. What's there to be mad about? You're the one in a relationship with her now, be happy. 

Also, never ask that question again. Don't ask questions you know you won't like the answer to you silly sausage."
"Who has van sex in the driveway with someone not their spouse? Twice?

I mean I'm not for cheating in any form but she didn't have the common decency to not do it right in front of your face? "
"Water maker here: Hot chocolate powder typically contains a portion of powdered milk anyway. Personally I just really don’t like drinking milk unless it’s in cereal (and even then it’s skim, and I don’t drink the leftover milk,) and *warm* milk has a tendency to make me feel kinda nauseous. I do however enjoy chocolatey goodness once in a while. 

I usually make coffee and then add a few spoonfuls of hot chocolate powder to it and mix it up."
"Lots of daily hugging, notes left on the counter, balance when it comes to house upkeep/chores, telling each other how much we love each other. It's working pretty well we have been married 22 years and have been together for 31 years."
"In general there seems to be some weird delusion that people love to entertain of being super special.

Like how some people can't accept that they are not ""the best in bed"" of the 7 people their lover slept with. Like really did you expect you were? 1/7 chance bro.

People seem to collectively have such an overinflated ego that statistical expectations and reality becomes insulting, hurtful and something they can't cope with."
She may have had a bacterial or yeast infection. A healthy vagina typically doesn't smell strongly.
"You don't, you gas light her, untill she's convinced milk is water and make her drink real hot chocolate.......... wait what did i just advocate for"
This is how they celebrate Christmas in Alabama 
"I got rejected for being too short too dude! High five but you’re actually tall so I’ll have to jump. 

I found it hilarious honestly because she said “you’re fucking perfect like you actually get me and we share the same passions but you’re just so short it’s just not gonna work”. I just laughed and said ok and continued on about our conversation like nothing happened. 

Bonus round is when another girl I got to know for a little while and she rejected me because I was “too well mannered”. She sent me scathing texts asking me why I would always say sir or ma’am, get into conversations with her family whenever they came over to her place, and my personal favorite using turn signals because apparently that’s well mannered and not you know, a fucking law. I have to guess that she was more or less looking for problems. "
Jesus christ that's genius. I used to sleep sitting at my desk because the entrance door to the room outside my office was broken and loud enough to wake me. 
Well I'm glad you reconnected with your father so you guys can start the serious boning again
"Her self esteem. She thinks so poorly of herself that it is a frustrating turn off. Especially when she is literally a genius and thinks she's an idiot, and she is so gorgeous but she complains about every perceived flaw. "
"Got told that I was an amazing guy and she had a great time, but she couldn't date a genetic freak and possibly pass it on to her children (I'm a type 1 diabetic).  I told her thanks and I appreciated her being so up front on what a cunt she was.  "
"At 25 I’m doing pretty well financially. I have about 100k in various accounts.

"Holy shit, that first paragraph should be stickied at the top of almost every post on reddit that deals with relationships.  "
"Little things, no matter how small can make the biggest difference.  Also just because you don’t understand why something makes her happy, or even mad doesn’t invalidate the fact that she is happy or mad about it.  For example I always hated buying flowers because I thought they were just a waste of money but it makes her happy so I do it.  Just because I don’t understand it doesn’t invalidate the fact that it makes her happy."
"""Hard to say they're all smokin hot""

"""...we've been boyfriend/girlfriend ever since we started going out."""
We never did.  She just eventually introduced me as her boyfriend.  I think this worked fine for us because we are both a bit old fashioned in how we view monogamy.  
"Someone said that I reminded them of their ex husband. 

On average I'm not given a reason. Its basically after 2-3 dates I get the ""I'm just not ready for a relationship"".

"The day I beat my grandfather. He was a risk expert. He taught me how to play and in the process taught me how to beat him. It was him and my cousins as adversaries. I started in Africa, went into Europe and South America. Moved to North America.with Asia surrounded, I began my slow March to Australia in a pincer fashion. When it was done he just looked down his glasses at the board, looked up at me and said, ""good job."" I'm pretty sure I cried happy tears."
It’s not a 50/50 proposition. Sometimes it’s 30 you and 70 her. Sometimes it’s 80 you and 20 her. Remember this and clean up after yourself.
"Being one year older. Literally said ""what the hell? Sorry but didn't expect you to be so old."""
"When she got home from work she would take off all of her clothes, wash off her make-up, change into pajamas, and watch TV in the bedroom while fucking around on her phone. 

No make-up = no public, so that meant I did any and all errands by myself. She also would rarely leave the bedroom and if she needed anything she'd yell at me from across the house (regardless of what *I* was doing) for every single tiny little thing she needed.

She wound up leaving me. I'll always love her for that.

"
This thread makes me realize that the girls that have rejected me have been quite kind about it. I'll take what I can get.

This is an incredible post. After his dad passed away you continued with this practice? That's somewhat really nice in a sort of weird way if you ignore the necessary break and enter part.
"Dump her, hit the gym, lawyer up"
"I work in a kitchen. Mostly from terrible life decisions. Felon, etc. 
Met a server, started messing around. 
Turns out she was taking a break between college and law school. 
We have our fun and she goes to leave to a top 20 law school. 
Tell her it’s over, she’s too good for me anyways. She’s convinced she’s not. 
Maintain long distance. 
Two years into law school she asks me to move in. 
Move across the nation, quit my high paying job. Work for peanuts again just to be with her. 
Three months in she realizes she actually is too good for me. Starts cheating with other well off law student. 
I’m almost a year in and still saving to leave. 

So yeah. That’s kind of annoying. "

"I broke up with a girlfriend of 3 years in August. I was really fucked up from it. Miserable. Regretted it all and very depressed but she wouldn't take me back. I got my shit together, tried to get out there again, and hated it. Didn't enjoy the casual sex, didn't find anyone worth really pursuing.

My best friend lives in Oregon. I live in Texas. His girlfriend's best friend was also very single at the time and was 2 years out of a terrible marriage. She was ready to find someone serious again. Also lives in Texas.

So they worked their magic, set us up in a way that wasn't forced or hinted at, and we hit it off. I fell in love with her. She fell in love with me. Our best friends are fucking wizards and we couldn't be happier."
"I was flatting with my sister and she bought a friend home. We hit it off, spent 16 fantastic years together. "
"Female roommates while in university gave me the shocking realization that not all women were like my mom and none of them in fact enjoyed cleaning up after themselves, let alone me.

Living with girlfriends taught me that women take a long time to prepare for going out. Like, an insane amount of time. Protip: Don't suggest that the level of effort is exorbitant or needless in any way if you want to get laid again."

"She has bad breath pretty frequently. I’m 33 and not rich, so at a certain point I just decided to keep gum in my pocket and give it to her when she smells. I’m not going to find someone better."
"Sometimes people send me something like a song, a shortclip or even a meme that I have already seen or heard. I never tell them I've known that before, I like them to think that they somehow brighten up my day by showing something new to me. There's no bigger buzzkill than when you are all excited about something that you want to share with someone, you share it and thenthe person is like ""Oh, I knew it already""

Another thing is that some years ago there was a website called CompassionPit, where there was an Omegle-like chat where one person would vent and another would listen. I've spent countless hours there listening and trying o help whoever I talked with. Made me a lot aware of the affects of depression, suicidal thoughts and breakdowns. Some people know that I've done this, but nt many of them "

"I write “awesome wife and mother” on my forms at the doctors office when they have questions about spouse. Pays off about every 5 years when she goes to the same doctor or dentist. 

The nurses were bubbling over when she first showed up for an appointment. She said “y’all (Texan) are having a great day!” And they whipped out my forms and said you are the awesome wife and mother! 

Needless to say, bedtime that night was pretty exciting. 

Now that I think about it, I need to tip the ladies at the doctors offices! "

"I had a neighbor like this.  His mother just died (she had a mental illness).  I think you should invite him over for beers or weed or whatever.  But I wouldnt say to him that he looks like he is about to off himself, thats just going to make it worse.

What worked for me was I told him I was going through a rough patch and could really use some help.  All lies, Im fucking awesome and never need anything.  Most guys like to be helpers and not drainers.  Sometimes thats all guys need is just someone who needs their help and therefore them.  Insert some kind of psycho bullshit about guys feelings of self worth being tied up in how useful they are.

Anyways thats my advice, put yourself in the position of needing the help youre thinking he needs.  He isnt likely to want to be helped or be a burden, in fact that could very well make it worse, but he is likely to want to help.  I think its called the Ben Franklin effect, people asked to do favors liked you more for it probably because you thought they were so awesome that you trusted them with this very important task.

There is a homeless guy that rides his bike all around my neighborhood(well I dont know if he was actually homeless but he might as well be).  The point is I dont think the dude has much.  I could have given him food and let him know I think he has failed at life and doesnt have shit (not saying Id think that but dude could well think I did even if I didnt).  Instead I told him I had too many tomatoes in my garden and couldnt pick them because I had to go out of town (out of town being onto reddit to shit post) before the freeze.  Anyways he told me he'd pick them for me.  So, he got tomatoes (which again I realize isnt the best ""food"" but come on) and he got to do someone a favor.  Last month I gave him pecans but it was another favor because they were getting stuck in my dog's paws.  These are just examples Im not trying to say Im a fucking saint or anything, Im just saying I find its easier to help people if you frame it as a favor to you instead of you doing them a favor."

I was planning on just getting through college on video games instead of socially interacting then my twin brother got a gf from tinder and her roommate happened to be a socially awkward redditor. It's been over a year and a half and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. 
"So everyone's making sure to remind you it's not a problem, because it isn't. It doesn't say anything bad.

But what you're after is how to get over it. I'd say empathize. When you feel uncomfortable, imagine the tables are reversed and how you might hope she would handle that information.

Shake off the narrative of the history and focus on the present. The reality is she is there with you now. Nothing in her past changes that. She still loves you as much as she would if she hadn't. Nothing about her physically or mentally is warped for the experience. The present with her hasn't changed."
"I'm a girl but I found him in the fruit and vege store where he worked. Had to buy a lot of over priced avocados to go see him every day and flirt. Mysteriously won the fruit bag of the week and then just asked him out. And here we are, about 18.months later. Married. Yeah. So. "

"&gt; Or do you only date people you’ve known for a while?

Basically this. Without the ""dating"". Dating as a whole simply does not exist in the same capacity it exists in the US. To quote myself:

&gt;This is not how it works in other countries. Over here, this dating culture does not exist. You meet your SO in school, university, through friends or through hobbies. Usually people spend time together enough and then just go out with each other, by that point they are basically a couple. They know they are compatible because they've known each other for some time and when both feel like it, then tada - you have yourselves boyfriend and girlfriend. No ""seeing multiple-people-at-the-same-time"" or anything, just a natural way of progressing. Randomly asking out someone you barely know is not really that big here and would probably give you a weird look instead, most of the time."
Yes
This was surprisingly not that long
"Her muffin top bothers me now.  She didn't always have it - but years of drinking and a sedentary lifestyle have taken their toll.

A weird thing is, I didn't even realize it was that bad until I posted a pic of her (with her consent obviously) on one of the wifesharing seddits.  People were commenting about her muffin top and how she resembled Hank Hill's body LMAO.  Haven't been able to get that image out of my head. "
"Don't give up, an American white woman I worked with that was tall and stunning married an Indian dude that by appearance shouldn't have had a chance.

"Yeah, well, shit happens. 

She clearly had a few to drink so the filter was down for the evening. Even her lady friend who was standing next to her went wide-eyed and pulled her off because two other guys noticed the exchange as well.

For example, in the last year I bought a homeless woman lunch and chatted with her, gave a drunk stranger I met on the street a ride home in the middle of the night, and reached out to a random Facebook friend who was posting suicidal statuses. Sometimes it's nice to keep those little moments for yourself."

"To OP: You saw a can of worms labeled “SO’s Sexual History” and opened it.

Here’s how I dealt with it (I never asked):

* She didn’t know me then

* I fucked as often as I could before I knew her

* I can’t hold her accountable for actions that would go against our relationship before our relationship began

And that’s all there is to it. Basically, you now know that your SO was an adult before meeting you.

To anyone who has not yet opened this particular can of worms: DO NOT OPEN THIS PARTICULAR CAN OF WORMS.

No good will come from it. Be mature, keep the past in the past."

"He has a couple ""warts"" on his hands. They dont respond to the wart medicine so the only option is to freeze/burn them off. I have delicately brought the subject up 1 or 2 times but he would rather have those than scars he says... If it was my hands I'd prefer scars, because scars fade.

Most of the time I don't notice them but when I do it makes me a bit sad and honestly a tiny bit repulsed. He has such nice hands otherwise. I just need to get over it I guess. Sorry honey :("

"I took this girl out to movies and dinners, often staying out until 1 or 2 in the morning. I didn’t really pressure the relationship too much because we had only just met a couple weeks before she went out of state for a 3 month internship. During her internship we ended up talking on the phone every single night until she fell asleep on the call. 

When she got back I was the first person she stopped to see on her way home. We went out to see Captain America or something like that and as we walked into the theater I took her hand. She gasped and gave an audible, “oh no.”

After the movie she could tell I was frustrated so looks me dead serious and says, “we’re just friends, you must not have very much experience with dating if think otherwise.”

So, that’s when I knew. 

Doesn’t matter, I met my wife a couple weeks later. "
"See, that's the thing - from one brown dude to another: we shouldn't have to base our desirability on stereotypes. 

It's like ""model minority"" level shit that really doesn't have a bearing on us as individuals and actually adds unnecessary pressure on dudes to live up to the expectation of the communities they belong to. Shit like this also presents the idea that we're a lot more wedded to our cultures than we necessarily are and that shit's intimidating as fuck for someone who doesn't know the first thing about it. 

I can be an Indian guy with IBS and absolutely shit work ethic....*but* still have redeemable qualities that make me desirable to someone else. That'd be like dating an Asian because they can math well.

He claims he’s sick/tired/can’t sleep good every day and all the time.

And then he says the thing you know he's going to say and has that great big grin on his face, so you smile back at him like ""well done, dear. Good pun"" because, even though you want to just roll your eyes at him, he's clearly so pleased with himself that you just can't bring yourself to do it, even though you know all you're doing is encouraging him to further torment you with puns."

"I went 24 years without any relationship, kiss, cuddling, asking out or generally anything that might lead to sex, a fling or a relationship. So yeah, I wasn't too optimistic about the future.    
I was so insecure that I made dating profiles but was too shy to ever text anyone or even visit profiles (seeing as she could see that and might be creeped out).    

I met one girl in the Askmen chatroom. She saw a topless picture of me and really wanted to meet up. She was in the process of breaking up with her boyfriend, so I was kind of a rebound I guess.    
Anyway, that was the first time I experienced being desired and wanted. Somebody **wanted** to be naked with me and **wanted** to be touched by me. That absolutely blew my mind.    

We didn't have sex, but it was a big enough confidence boost that I managed to send out some messages online afterwards.   

I met one east-asian girl who escaped her muslim upbringing and hated the whole ""alpha"" traits. She was fine with me being shy, inexperienced, insecure and so on. In fact, it was a bonus for her as she has some tendencies to dominate people.

Don't get me wrong: there are guys out there who are actually shitty people who hide behind the whole ""I'm a nice guy, why don't women like me?!"" façade, but the hatred towards it on Reddit (and the Internet period) is really extremely and over the top.

The problem I have with it is that it basically places women on a pedestal and plays into the ""just world"" fallacy: women only date nice guys, therefore, if women won't date you, you aren't *really* a nice person.  This operates under the assumption that women never make bad dating decisions (newsflash: sometimes they do) and that guys who are genuinely good people never struggle romantically (also newflash: sometimes the do)."

Everyone is their own worst critic. In terms of objectively rating your looks, you’re gonna be the worst person to give an unbiased rating. And hey everyone is different with different preferences. A good friend of mine has very different tastes in men than I do; over the years she’s dated new men and will rave to me about how hot they are, and when I meet the guys I think “...really?” My opinion is *my* opinion though, not the opinion of every woman.

Once he said something about being glad he'd never have to push a baby through his pee hole.  I said, ""Women don't either. We don't pee out of our vaginas, silly.""  He was like, ""Huh?  Where does the pee come from?"""
Sorry but your girlfriend is the second most sexy creature on earth. 😜
And in your buttcrack
We were guarding an ammo supply point for a month from 6pm-6am. I go out of my way not to fraternize with people in my unit but we both were from different units that volunteered to go help with hurricane relief. One day after spending countless hours of talking she told me she really wanted to fuck something. Me not even having porn because there was no internet or cell service down there was equally horned up. I can now say I got some in a Hmmwv 
I knew when I cared about their happiness before my own 
"&gt; he thing is I am a very insecure person and although I trust her, I don’t trust this other guy. 

Unless you believe he's going to rape her across the internet, that's gobbledegook for ""I don't trust her after all but don't have the balls to say it"".

Do try to be more honest with yourself."
I think we can realise the person you've responded to gets their entire daily caloric intake in one drink. 
"I had a couple of warts on my finger years ago. I was super embarrassed about them. The ice treatment wasn't too bad, yes, it hurt, but within a couple of months they were gone and there's no scar there that I even notice. "
"Stacks dishes and stuff real weird. Smaller plates will be under bigger plates. Large bowls will be stacked on top of big bowls instead of nested within to make more room. Whenever there's an irregular dish, it is usually shoved between other dishes where there's some space. Sometimes boxes of crackers or cold medicine will be stacked in, on, or around other dishes instead of in other parts of the cabinets where those things are.

Conversations about it are just met with completely blank stares like I'm talking about something incomprehensible."
"Girl said I was too skinny, I put on some weight and then I was too fat :/"
"So, I'll preface it with the fact that I have a girlfriend who I've been dating for around a year. And everyone's experience is different.

I think that online dating has convinced literally everyone that they can do better. I think that people are so terrified that they are ""settling"" that they're afraid to commit to anything.

It's a symptom of society, everybody does it. You ask someone, male or female ""hey want to get pizza?"" And they go ""yeah maybe"" ""ok well why maybe?"" ""Idk"" ""Is there a reason you're saying maybe?"" ""Well no...but I want to keep my options open.""

I personally feel that it's sort of this thing I call the ""Yelp"" mentality. You need to do the absolute best thing available to you, and if it's not the absolute best you're wary of trying it. 

Additionally, I think that online dating has made talking to women an amazingly difficult task. Every single girl on online dating has hundreds of guys messaging her at once, and its functionally all the same conversation. You really need to stand out, and unless you have something that makes you stand out you get stuck in the crowd. If you're an above average looking guy, but you can't carry a conversation on your own god help you.

And other guys aren't helping, lots of people are shitty. A good friend of mine got completely stood up twice in two weeks by some tinder guys. Made the date, set the time and location and didn't show up. No explanation given, blocked her phone number. So now she's like ""fuck why put myself out there""

I met my girlfriend on tinder, but I'm blessed with being able to be convincingly witty and got her on a good day. I talked for about a day about funny stuff, said ""hey honestly small talk sucks, would you be down to just go get a beer?"" And that worked out well."
"I now had Dr Pepper coming out of my nose. 
That’s one hell of a request. "
"Bruv I wasn't justifying him just explaining what the problem was

If he had hooked up with 10 chicks and she told him she had hooked up with one other guy only, he'd feel pretty good about it. It's just standard insecurity."
yes
"See, it's this kind of aggressive, condescending over-generalization that helps nobody. 

There is a world of difference between ""has had sex before you"" and ""has a casual attitude towards casual sex"".

Promiscuity is not attractive to everyone, and that's ok."
"I’ve been a terrible husband. We’re borderline divorcing and reading this made me realize everything I hadn’t done. I’m surprised she’s stayed as long as she has, not receiving any of this, and quite frankly don’t blame her for wanting to walk out.  I have a 9mo old daughter and would be furious is she dated/married someone like me.

There’s always more to a story, but it doesn’t matter. One needs to stop making excuses and take responsibilities for their own actions. Stop saying “well s/he did x, y, or z” and try to justify your own actions.

Thanks for taking the time and writing all of this out.  Your partner (yay assuming) doesn’t know how lucky they are to have someone like you."
I'd just assume she didn't have any other bats available and it was cheap. 
When we'd been together a year and she hadn't opened up even a little. It was like being in love with a brick wall.
"TIL after reading these comments, being single really isn't that bad. I only have to nag myself! "
ITT: women have never been interested in me
You guys don’t get to know them better first? Or do you only date people you’ve known for a while? 
"The part that sucks worst: You just went through something horrible, and you can't talk it out with the person you're used to leaning on the most."
"Sadly I am.  But, fear not!  There are many other folks out there that feel this way.  As strange as this sounds, there is no such thing as the ""Perfect person"" for you.  Yes, you two may get along splendidly, and share a ton of interests, but marriage is hard work.  We have to evolve together, and sometimes it's not pretty.  My wife and I do fight, but we love one another and we WANT to make it work.  So we evolve as a pair."
"At minimum sink washing your genitals and ass crack is a courtesy if you're about to have sex, this goes for both men and women. Even in the heat of the moment of making out, you can still excuse yourself to use the washroom....or just simply say that you need to clean up. Trust me, it will be greatly appreciated. "
"I can’t speak for all europeans, but in France you’re considered a couple as soon as you kiss for the first time, unless there was alcool involved. "
Date was normal. But when we hooked up afterwards she wanted me to pretend to be her ex and I did it because I was stupid and horny
"I had an on again off again relationship with this girl.  I finally decided to break up with her for good and she didn't want to accept it, threatened to kill herself and made a few other threats.  I let her friends and parents know that she threatened suicide and went home.  About a week later a friend crashed at my house and his phone kept ringing every few minutes.  I grabbed the phone to turn it off because we were still trying to sleep and I saw that she had called and texted him a lot.  As I was holding the phone he got another text from her saying ""I really need to talk to him, can you talk to him for me"". I replied ""Yes, no problem"", asked what she needed to say and she replied ""I think I'm pregnant, I missed my period and he's the only person I've had sex with recently"". 

I freaked out woke my friend up and showed him the texts.  We decided to go pick her up and buy some pregnancy tests and have her take one.  She took one and it came out positive.  I was freaking out.  A few minutes later my friend started screaming at her.  I went to see what was going on, I walked in the room and I saw the box of tests we just bought was still closed and sealed.  She had bought a positive test from someone hoping that it would convince me to get back with her.  

I started yelling at her and told her to get in the car, I would drop her off at home and leave and it would be the last time I'd ever see her.  I pulled up into the driveway and she wouldn't get out.  I had to get out of the car, open her door and drag her out.  Once I got her out I told her that I never wanted to see her again.  She was standing in the driveway crying, I backed out, looked at her smiled, waved and drive off.  I haven't seen her since."
"Leave sooner.

Woman 1. she was a cheating count


Woman 2. I knew early on i didn't want what she wanted. She deserved better. "
You just have to go fuck yourself buddy. 
"Perfect answer.

"Me! Me!

So, when I have guests over, I cook, clean, and serve everything. I'd feel like a bad host if I had friends cleaning or getting their own food.

But when I'm over at friend's places, I feel like a bad guest if I don't help with the food and cleaning."

How long after you were married did he admit he was married? 
"My good friend is dating an identical twin. He like it cause he can say ""your sister is *really* hot,"" and all she can do is thank him.

"Well shit if that's being friends I should be your friend. You pay for dinner and the bar tab, I'll spare the movie ticket cost."
"No.

No.

Bad."
"True, but the friend already helped mess up one life that night, best to cut it off at that."
Dinosaurs. Like Make a show or something. 
"Yeah, not having a penis makes urinating messy. Gotta clean up somehow."
"Just like people who yell ""achoo"" when they sneeze."
Apparently a girl rejected me because I wasn't white. Otherwise I was perfect. She told this all to one of my friends the next month.
"The idea that a fulfilling sexual relationship should have no bearing on your well being whatsoever.

I appreciate that thinking getting into a relationship will entirely fix your anxiety, depression etc. is a bit flawed, but for most people in their twenties and especially in their late twenties, having an SO is pretty important to overall wellbeing.

We're social creatures, we need the intimacy of an SO in our lives. But I consistently see Reddit dismiss this as trivial and borderline unnecessary."
"Hate to break it to you, but if you're at all moderately attractive then &gt;50% of your male friends would like to fuck you if given the chance. "
"Coffee and activity. Get up, move around. Go for a brisk walk around the building outside. Stretch and flex your muscles, getting a quick boost of blood to the brain from tensing your legs is a mild pick me up. Sitting immobile and staring at a screen will make you sleep.

Should have spent more money on that tattoo. 
"I'm a bit worried about asking this (because it can get into the ""No good can come from this flag of the post)...but if there is toxic masculinity, is there a ""toxic feminity""?"
Even then I'd feel weird. My biggest problem is I don't think anybody *really* wants me. So having to pay someone to pretend to want me will probably just exacerbate those feelings.
"Am an Alabamian, Can Confirm. "
"""... with you.""

You learn to sort of add that to the end of rejections with time.  Not exclusive to a relationship rejection either. Which is fine, by the way, because different people make you feel different things.  If bitter, you can see it as lying.  I think it's just a way to call things off.  It's not you it's me."

Probably roast the shit out of her and hope she'll read it
10. It's a make or break criterion.
The way she knows my Reddit username
Sounds like you’re dating both a 14 year old and a 60 year old
"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years and we do all of these a lot and it's nice to know you've kept it up for so long. I'm hoping we can do the same.

It's nice to have someone to hug and tell you they love you when you get home from a hard day of work. "
"You are going to need to get further fucked up on caffeine. If you don't have to pee, you're not sweating, or your heart feels normal, drink more caffeine. I have done this and the hallucinations started around 40 hours of no sleep, unless there really were people lined up in the shadows and someone speaking Russian in the next room.

Disclaimer: please try not to literally die because you took advice from some idiot on reddit."
"I cope with it by not giving a shit. How many people she's fucked before me is none of my concern, so long as she hasn't contracted a disease from it. Then it would be my concern."
They're both pretty successful that they've found eachother. They should be happy about that. Not worrying about something THAT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER
Shorter than most peoples TLDRs. 
"If he's not actively listening to me, he will not hear a word I say, about anything. This gets particularly annoying when we are playing games together.

Minute or two passes.

Every single day of my life.

""We should make hamburgers for dinner tonight.""
""Mmn, sure.""
Twenty minutes later.
""Okay, let's make dinner... What do you wanna eat?""
As I stare patiently and imagine stabbing him; ""... Burgers?""
""Yeah, that sounds fine!""

If I don't get him to look at me or make sure I have his attention before I speak, the words out of my mouth are so much static. :|"
Go with your friend and act *super* gay. It'll be really funny if you let someone catch you blowing him in the bathroom once the drinks start flowing. Everyone will feel really silly when you reveal that you're not actually gay.

My wife has to have it pitch black. Any source of light will eventually disturb her no matter how small.
"I agree with the sentiment, but I'd soften the wording a bit. It's about both of you giving what you can give and not keeping score. But going 100% selfless isn't sustainable for most people and can lead to resentment.


Maybe it's just semantics, I'm just trying to address some of the replies to your comment."
"&gt;  what being hungry feels like, and it doesn't bother me like it used to. I can be hungry all afternoon, no sweat.

I feel this is one of the essential things to realize for fat people to be able to lose weight: it’s ok to feel hungry. You can handle it. "
"Hahaha :-D

""You're not paying attention to MEEEEEEE!""

I've had that experience, though it was more in the context of hanging out with her friends and actually trying to interact with them instead of being a man-sized purse."
At least she TRIES to load it.   Mine will just throw shit in the sink. 
"We got a free trial of ten minutes, spent it trying to get someone to shit on a bowl. Great success."
"I carried on an occasional text correspondence with a woman I have never met for a few years. To this day I don't even know her name.

It started one Valentine's Day shortly after moving to a new area and switching mobile numbers. I got a text from an unfamiliar number, something like ""happy valentines day babe, I miss you so much.""

I responded ""happy valentines, but I think you have the wrong number.""

Response comes back, ""oh, so sorry, my husband died last year, and I've been texting his old number once in a while when I felt down. Sorry, I'll delete your number.""

I told her if it brought her comfort she could still do it, and she did. For about three years after that I'd text her around holidays and such. Nothing super personal. Of course I told my wife about it, but no one else.

I hope she's been able to heal and is living a full life. "

"10. Sex is a big part of how I show I love someone, and it's how I want them to show they love me. And I want to have sex with someone that wants to have sex with me."
So much of our identity is centered around being alpha at *EVERYTHING*. You could be an accomplished violinist but see some dude juggling and making your girlfriend giggle and all of a sudden you're learning how to juggle. 
Too English. 
"Yeah, I know. :( 

I stopped caring a while ago about the things that I cannot change, but the incident left me hyper aware of the difficulties of being a person of color in the dating scene. "
"I really wanted to take my [current] boyfriend out to a major league baseball game before we were official.  I didn’t want him to think I was crazy and bought tickets assuming he’d want to go just for him, so I bought the tickets anyways and then told him my original date of my brother bailed so I had a spare if he’d wanna go with me.  Still to this day 5 year’s later, he’s got no idea I really bought the ticket just hoping he’d say yes. "
"OP said 5 guys in a month, not total."
Having a giant dick because everyone wants to see the freakshow in your pants.
"I don't understand why people are acting like you're an asshole for feeling like this. First off, you're allowed to feel however you feel. I'm sure you aren't picking to feel shitty, I don't understand why people are so aggressive because they themselves wouldn't feel the same way. Especially when the way you feel is rooted in biology. Secondly, I think you're best bet is time and to rationally work through the issue. Is your problem that she slept with 5 guys or the time period in which she slept with them? Probably the latter. Try shifting the time period then. In the last 10 months she has slept with six guys, one of them being you. That may be more palatable. I find that when you change the constraints of your issue they often times don't seem nearly as bad as we originally thought. Hope you figure it out though dude. "
Yes and try with half and half or heavy cream if you want it creamy af
"I have a dick peircing.

"The last female roommate I had who I was not actually dating myself was a dominatrix type, and I'd listen through the thin wall...my clothes very much on and my hands nowhere near my dick, since femdom is a huge turnoff, but I enjoyed the ""radio porn"" since she really knew how to cleverly emasculate a guy in role play.

I brought it up to her and she thought it was hilarious and told me that the creativity of it turned her on more than the actual dominance part did.

She was a great girl. Remains a platonic friend of mine to this day. And I learned a ton of cool stuff about the dominatrix mind."

How did you manage to get time alone with the corpse?
There it is
I go to a school that's known for engineering. Alot of friends who are going through it. It's such bullshit. They're internships they get paid $20/hr. While I was working for free to just to put it on my resume. Really wish I was smart lol. 
"I've been there. I had to decide what to do because staying friends after someone blindsided me with a love manifesto is cruel, but I also wasn't romantically interested in him at all and was not in any mental state to be dating due to current life circumstances.  

I decided, fuck it, I guess I'll try? It was a bad decision that led to confusion and more hurt feelings for him and a ton of anxiety and guilt for me. I felt bad, but I can't make myself be attracted to someone and he had his own serious issues he needed to sort out. "
Means it was a dope little comment.

"I think lots of people are so fucking weird when it comes to sex and dating.

One one side you have some girls thinking that they should retain sex as long as they can in order to test the guy on the beginning of the relationship.
And on the other end, you have some guys that think that if a girl wants to sleep with you on the first date, she's a slut, but if she doesn't want it yet on the third date, she's a prude.

Like, how much complicated do you need it to be ? Do these people make statistic and note on the calendar their probabilities of having sex with a new date on every day of the week and then calculate some sort of ""dating potential"" at the end of every night out ?

You're just making it harder for yourself."
"A couple of times when I was driving us to places she knew about, but which I did not, she told me to turn left when she clearly indicated to turn right, and vice versa. Those were needlessly high-stress moments."
Shame is really tricky. A serious lack of it is probably the #1 thing I couldn’t tolerate in a partner. But too much (stick up ass) would be unbearable too. The margins are honestly pretty tight. 
Maybe blackpeoplemeet.com isn't the right site for you.
Couple dozen? Try a much larger number here...  and then I got it in my head that Bitcoin was going nowhere and sold them shortly after. I would have millions today if I just kept them. I kick myself for this frequently.
