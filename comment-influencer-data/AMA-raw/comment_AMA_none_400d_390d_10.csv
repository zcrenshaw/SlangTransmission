1,Really sticking it to the corporate machine
2,"I found out about his other family a few hours before he died. I believe this was the same time that they found out about myself and daughter. The days leading up to his death made it hard for us not to find out. I sometimes wonder if he did it on purpose.

He worked as a truck driver and often went 'tramping' so was away for a few weeks at a time. I didn't question it as I worked in same industry and knew what the job involved. 

About a year after he died, my daughter met one of her brothers. She now has a brother, sis in law and nephews and they all absolutely adore each other. I'm very glad of this but i'm not part of it.


"
3,"What happened right after? Did your family come running in the middle of the night and see you over the bad guy? How did your siblings handle it? How long did it take you before you were able to sleep soundly in your own bed? Do you ever have nightmares?  Feel free to ignore these questions, I know they’re prying, but I’m curious."
4,I would just like to say the abbreviation looks like motherfucker and that amuses me
5,Don't ever change bro
6,How'd the exam go?
7,"How did you find out about the other family? Did you meet them? How much time did he spend with you and your daughter?

Also, sorry you went through this. Sounds like a truly awful situation "
8,interesting AMA topic. poor responses to good questions.. 
9,"sorry if this is about to be long. so we were caught on 2 separate occasions. my boyfriend and his roommate went in together on a 12 pack. the day of the delivery his roommate went to a friends house that he had paid to use his address. instead of UPS, an undercover DEA agent delivered the package. we had no clue anything had happened but we couldn't get in touch with the roommate, so we decided to just casually ride by. we saw people carrying boxes out of the house. we knew something was up, so we just kept driving.  as soon as we turned off onto the main road an undercover SUV gets behind us and signals us to pull over. he had no reason to stop us and he knew it, but he looked at my boyfriend and said ""I know who you are, and what's going on. you can either come with me to the police station or I will send cops out with a warrant to search"" so since I had a little bit of stuff in my house we went to the police station, I went to the bathroom and called one of our friends who worked maintenance for the neighborhood we lived in and had him go clear out whatever I had at my place.  so that day we were just questioned but they never found anything and they had no proof only suspicion. 

fast forward about 2-3 months. we had moved into a new apartment and had slowed down drastically on moving product. his roommate was dealing with court stuff and police wanting him to snitch but they were really good friends and my boyfriend offered to help him with whatever he needed as far as money to live on, a lawyer, etc. well one day while i was at school I got a call from my boyfriend and he said he felt weird, then while on the phone I heard a knock and he said there were police at the door and hung up. I raced home and watched for hours, about 10 police officers/DEA rummage through my shit and take literally everything out of our house besides beds, couches and lamps. his roommate had worn a wire 3 times to our house to set my boyfriend up. "
10,"My wife is pregnant and I am looking forward to  playing with my future kid! We had to abort our first baby since it also had the gene. Thanks to modern medicine we were able to implant a baby without the Huntingtons gene, so we know that the kid will be healthy"
11,"What’s it like having that many relatives 
Is it hard around holidays to get them something or do you just get them the same think "
12,The wars today are horrible divisive and not tolerable. That is my belief and opinion. I want to tell the youngest generation to eliminate their prejudices right now! And get along with your friends and neighbors all the time.
13,"One of my old secondary school friends told me about it, We've been part of the cult for 6 years, biggest surprise so far was the Red Wedding (I haven't caught up since season 2)"
14,Are you there yet?
15,I bet they still have Whole Foods though.

17,"I'm not close to many of them, alot of them live in other countries. The cousins I am close to, we usually have a night out together at Christmas instead of buying gifts.:) As well as my 6 siblings, I have 8 nephews and nieces so Christmas is already crazy expensive."
18,Sounds like hipster town without iPhones and Macbooks
19,What do you mean when you say “the days leading up to his death made it hard for us to not find out?”
20,Charging ashore in the islands in the Pacific were pretty scary moments. Shells were bursting in the air and there were tons of precarious barricades. It was horrendous. I was the flame thrower group leader. 
21,Not you (thanks reddit...)
22,*irritated grunt*
23,Money n**** why you contemplating life right now?
24,"Great questions.
The majority of my clients, I like. I felt sorry for one once, and I got to know him better, and actually ended up dating him. So I try not to feel sorry for anyone before trying to figure them out. I have a certain respect for all of them, like legit respect, but also the respect you give a dog you dont know and could very well bite you. A lot of my clients I have known for years, and they are almost like family to me, family might be to strong of a word but its the best way for me to explain it. 
They are not all respectful. some try to get away with stuff, and push the rules. I have met a couple of people who I refused to see again, not always because they did something, but sometimes just because I got a bad vibe from them. "
25,"Average day will see us waking up at dawn, chores, looking after the animals, looking after the vegetable gardens, building and equipment maintenance, we all eat together, perform yoga, singing, prayers, meditation."
26,Do you own a bike and if so do you ever take it off any sweet jumps?
27,"How does someone afford a double life? I mean double mortgages, double car payments, double grocery bills? It seems like a large sum of money for your partner to overlook."
28,"pills. mostly Roxys- were also selling them, the money was endless so we both developed a habit unfortunately. 
But also we went out to dinners a lot and movies and took out friends on trips, to theme parks and stuff.
He bought a car and a motorcycle, then he started to collects guns. not in a violent way, everything was registered he just liked them and liked going to the shooting range. "
29,"(*everyone in van looks at me weird*)

Mom: you're 23, act your age"
30,"Mom: *silent* 
Dad: *laughs*"
31,"I have done lots of non-sexual things with clients. I have watched tv with a few and dvds. one guy used to take me shopping with him, he went to like best buy, and the mall, and walmart and stuff, like that and I just tagged along, we talked, and usually got food. He just didn't like going shopping alone. "

34,"I'm very glad that there is research being made in this field! I read a UK study which showed promising results. Sadly it will be too late for me sister and probably myself.

What trials are you working on? Would love to hear!"
35,"I am not trying to ask reddit to look for my friend. We are trying our best to locate him. Apologies if my post came across that way, not a native speaker.

As for how you can help, Just talk about it. Generate heat. Gain traction. I want to do what the government is fearing so deeply: that's creating awareness. Just talk about it and let the world know what's going on. To be honest i don't know how to combat this, i'm just an ordinary student. So I don't know if that is going to help. But I do know is I have to do everything in my power no matter how insignificant to combat injustice which is what i'm doing.

And thanks for your concern for my friend."
36,"What did you leave? We not turning around, that shit is just left now lil n****"
37,Now you've crossed the line.
38,"Before they disabled commenting on them, I was a big fan of all the irrelevant copypastas people would put in the comments. Were you a part of that as well? "
39,Approximately where is the commune located?
40,"*brothers look at me and laugh* 

Mom: what is that?"
41,Do you think it actually helps? I do the same and wonder.....
42,Yeah. Do that. Hope you fall out
43,"His coworkers were the same as mine mostly. He was a truck driver, I operated an agency to hire out truck drivers. We went to events together. I knew his best friend very well. I don't know which family he spent the most time with as we can only look back now and guess"
44,"What would be the best way for us on Reddit to help? Spread the word? Call or protest at embassies? Contact our own politicians? I don't know where to start. I'm sorry this shit is happening to you. I hope your friend is found safe.

Edit. Typo."
45,"No secret calls, no secret texts. I called him any time that I wanted to and we could always talk"

47,I mean life is good with pineapple on pizza

49,"The meetings are arranged through a website, That I just sort of stumbled upon randomly one day surfing the internet. It was a long time ago, and stuff like that was easier to find.  I am not giving the site address please dont ask, I have my privacy to worry about. "
50,"Businesses almost never know the rights of service dog handlers as outlined by the ADA. I was recently told that I would not be allowed to use the elevator at a hotel and I had to walk up 4 flight of stairs to my fourth floor room because I had a service dog. A MOBILITY service dog mind you. When I explained the ADA and the FAQ page associated with the law itself the front desk employee got a manager and after an hour of sitting down and explaining the rights of a handler, he wanted me to come down to give a presentation to the staff.

Businesses also fail to realize the rights that the ADA gives them. If a dog is urinating, defecating, out of control, aggressive, barking, or otherwise failing to follow handler commands the business can ask the person to leave. They may reenter the business if the dog does not reenter. Restaurants should never allow animals onto the chairs, or tables as it poses a major health code violation. Hotels can charge a pet fee if the handler leaves the animal in the room and then leaves the property as it shows that the animal is no longer under the handler's control. There are tons of ways for businesses to protect themselves from fake service dogs and if they would just stop being so afraid of being sued we wouldn't have this issue.

So why do they let these rambunctious animals behave so poorly without taking action? The biggest hit to the service dog community was the introduction of online registries. $20-200 gets you a service dog kit that includes but is not limited to a vest, ID badge, labeled leash, ADA information cards, and lastly the ""Certification"" papers. Businesses see these papers on fancy paper and think that it is legitimate. [The ADA FAQ page question 17](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html) has a sub section dedicated to this issue. I've had handler friends register dildos, unicorns, and a jar of nutella as a service dog through these sites. The $\_\_ doesn't skip the 2 years and $7,000-60,000 it takes to train a service dog. And its unfortunate that the system is so backasswards that the fakes have credentials and the legitimate ones do not. That is by far the biggest blow to our reputation because a fake with a badge goes to a restaurant and the restaurant employee asks their 2 questions: 1 is it a service animal? 2 What tasks is it trained to perform? ""I HAVE AN ID SO I HAVE RIGHTS. They are seated immediately. I walk in and the restaurant asks me, where is your ID or paperwork? Well I don't have any so now I have to take time out of my day to reeducate this business why legitimate teams don't have these magic IDs and paperwork. It hurts our credibility and wastes our time."
51,"So how did you find yourself in this line of work?

How are your “meeting” made with your clients ? "
52,Keep asking me these Damn questions and we'll see
53,Black mom confirmed.

56,"The moon, shut up"
57,I can’t believe while selling and doing drugs they weren’t concerned about their Roth IRA!
58,"I have a ton of advice from just the top of my head but here's a couple really important ones. 
1.) Pack it in, pack it out! Leave no trace!!!Its not just something they're supposed to say so they can keep holding Burning Man on our Black Rock Desert.  They're serious. Burning Man is expected to pick up every single sparkle, piece of confetti, and ash that lands on that desert. Help from the attendees to this awesome party really makes a difference. And please continue that as you leave through our northern Nevada cities too. The amount of trash that gets left behind on the roads every year is awful. Please don't ruin our desert. 
2.) Don't spend the entire event so drugged out you can't appreciate it. Burning Man is an incredible experience full of beautiful art and amazing people and while it is fun to trip at this party, make sure you sit back and appreciate what's going on as well. It's truly a magical experience. 
3.) Don't underestimate how prepared you should be. It will be hot and dry and dusty the entire week. Be patient with it. Dust storms suck but they're apart of the desert and there's no escaping them. Just be prepared. I can't even begin to explain the importance of having enough supplies. 
"
59,"Actually I was just getting ready to express my thankfulness for her helping me to do things like this I can no longer do on my own. I have nine other wonderful grandchildren, four grandsons and five granddaughters. That I love and am so proud of."
60,Whos your favorite child?
61,"yes, after a few months of selling large quantities of pot, we met a guy who could get an endless supply of Roxicodone 30s, we were getting and flipping about 500 a week. And molly, but that wasn't ever in our hands, we had someone who would go get it, sell it for us and just bring the money when he unloaded. "

75,Western Europe. 
76,"I’m a former JW as well. I was raised in it and started going less and less the smarter I got with school because I began realizing how unbelievably cult-y it actually was. My entire family wasn’t hardcore JW, so most of them still hang out with me like normal, but I haven’t spoken to my sister or my grandparents in years since I officially stopped going. 

How did it end for you? Did you just go less and less over time? Or did you just quit cold turkey? What’s your story "
77,Have you tried Pineapple with jalapeno? it's really great.

87,yes. it'll be 12 years in November. we were together for 4 years before all of this began
88,Odd. I would think most people in a cult wouldn't call it a cult.
89,"I was with my parents on the highway in the outskirts of Kansas City and a police officer came up to stop us and told us they had Pretty Boy Floyd captured in the car nearby. He had just come out of the city after a robbery, police followed him out of the city and finally caught him after barricading the highway ahead of him. We were delayed about 2-3 hours."
90,I am a phlebotomist and often have to take blood for this test.  I always read it as mother fucker.   Always.  But only in my head.
91,"Well, I've been extremely lucky in the sense that I've never broken a bone. But I have a few good scars. One time one of our bull-calves kept trying to escape through one of the fences, and I roped it. But he didn't much like that so he bolted, and I was dragged behind him. I didnt let go, and was thrown into a barbed wire fence, leaving two deep parallel cuts that went along the entirety of my forearm. I bled so much that I couldnt move my fingers, but its healed up nicely and I have 100% mobility. The scar looks pretty cool too. But I've seen some crazy stuff on other people though."
92,you call it a cult??
93,I would think any interaction with an ad would be valuable to an advertiser. 
94,"Clientele demographic?

What do you do to reduce sexual health risk?"
95,Why else would I name him Cooper haha
96,"It really is a heinous cult man, I'm happy you escaped, sorry some of your family is still fractured. I was homeschooled and my parents were, are, hardcore JW, so I was insanely programmed, totally brainwashed. I was a teen when grunge exploded and I started sinning really bad. Making out with girls and smoking, you know, really bad stuff. I actually went back three times, disfellowshipped and reinstated three freakin times, I just couldn't bare the thought of going through life without my parents love. I see now that they did and do love me... their minds are just corrupted by that evil organization. JWs find people at their lowest and feed them lies. Who doesn't want to believe they will see their dead grandma again, or that they will live forever. I understand how brainwashing works now. Changing people's risk/reward systems and creating that constant Jehovah-guilt-paradigm in their minds, f-ing up how their Serotonin works using repetition and positive and negative reinforcement, all of it, it's horrible man. They steal your individuality and extort people using their loved ones. Follow our rules or we will take everything that means anything from you. When I got kicked out I lost everyone I ever knew since I was a child, a whole community, and my little sister. I will never forgive them for that. We are close now but she cried herself to sleep for years missing her big brother. I really am proof that you can have your heart and body and mind shattered and still keep going. Thanks for your interest bro, have a great night."
97,Later rebuttal: We've never even went across the country

"
160,"No need to apologize. As I mentioned the government is censoring the local media. If they do that how is news going to reach people like you? Not your fault.

To answer your question, the whole political system is very corrupt in our country. Bus and truck drivers dont have licenses, and buses that are unfit for road are not being replaced. We are telling them to replace those dangerous buses but if they do that the people who owns the buses are going to be unhappy. A very strong but small syndicate owns and controls the buses and they operate like mafia. They extort and collect protection money from bus drivers and doesn't allow any newcomers and eliminates competition. So if they do what we asked that syndicate is going to become very unhappy and the government doesn't want that.

On top of that cabinet member in charge of this is part of that syndicate which is a clear conflict of interest. But the prime minister wont remove him because the pm needs him in the coming elections.

Hope you understood what i said. There is alot to cover. Please tell me if you don't understand anywhere and i will try to explain that part more elaborately."

170,unless you are Blue Oyster Cult
171,How did the other family take it?
172,Where you heading to? 
173,not a question....but just wanna say I'm glad you got out of that cult.
174,Did your grandparents had any other hobbies? :p
175,What happened with the gang run in?!
176,"the death and one of the robberies kind of goes hand in  hand, ill end with that one. 
So we had 2 separate houses (more like duplexs, it was a college town and really no one other than students lived there) but in the same little neighborhood, just down the street. we would sleep at my house but he had a huge gun safe down at his house that he kept mostly everything in. we came back from dinner one night to his roommate, who was also selling at the time, tied up with bungee wire and zip ties on the floor in the living room. he had a black eye and busted head from some punk ass kid coming in and trying to force him to give up the safe code. he got away with a little less than 28g of hash, and about 5 oz. 

The 2nd time didn't actually happen to us but a good friend, it was in the same neighborhood but up at the front. everyone was downstairs watching a movie, when 3 guys busted in the back door with guns screaming and telling everyone to get down. our friend and his girlfriend managed to get into his room and jump out of the window but one of the roommates was upstairs in his room and when he heard yelling he walked downstairs to see what happened. He startled one of the masked guys so they grabbed him and went to hit him in the head with the butt of a pistol, but instead the gun ended up going off and shooting the kid in the head. "
177,"He is going to relax for the night, we will try to continue responding tomorrow afternoon or in the morning. Thanks for the questions!"
178,Are you there yet now?
179,oxycodone- basically percocet without the tylenol that comes in high strengths. 15mg and 30mg were what we preferred. 
180,"What do you think about the wars the US is in now, and what message do you have for the youngest generation just now growing up?  
And thank you for all you’ve sacrificed serving this country!"
181,"It looks like (now many more than) 46 people are curious, so if you don't mind OP, answers would be cool.

Edit: parentheses."
182,"Alot of people who have come here, have come to escape the stress of the modern life, if a child is born in the commune they can leave if their parents leave or they choose to when they become an adult. 

We don't 'hate' technology per se, we do use some essentials, for example a car, and a satellite phone for emergencies. "
183,What would you say your chances are of being thrown out on the side of the road? Or being left at the destination to find your own way home?
184,Who hurt you?
185,"1. What types of homes do you live in? 
2. Do you have electricity? Plumbing? Well water?
3. Have the authorities ever come by to check on the kids?"
186,Are you and your boyfriend still together?
187,"What an excellent question!  

This is a tricky area.  Most people in the cult are brainwashed to the point that they believe YOU are the one who is nuts for NOT being a part of it.  

I think that spreading awareness of the truths about the cult is vital to narrowing the new-cult recruit pool as much as possible.  The more people know about the cult beforehand, they less likely they will be to get caught up in it.  Most people who are already Scientologists are lost causes.  I hate to say it, but it is the truth.  I have only succeeded in talking one friend into leaving the cult, and she was never in the Sea Org.  A handful of people I knew actually got kicked out of the cult, and that was the only reason they now have issues with the cult.  If they hadn't gotten the boot, they would still be obedient little followers.  

The problem is this: if you are vocally opposed to the cult, then you MUST be a pedophile, rapist, murderer, or some other type of gawdawful criminal.  At least, that is what Scientologists are brainwashed to believe.  It is beyond challenging to get anyone out of any cult.  

My parents are still in it.  Even after learning about all of the shit I was subjected to.    "
188,Ahhh this brings back memories from my childhood family road trips with all four of us crammed into the car and driving halfway across the country. 
189,"I'm trying to go to sleep, damn"
190,what's your favorite color?
191,"Is it okay if I piss in this bottle, it's only half full?"
192,"I was a drug dealer myself up until 6 years ago when I got caught. Received an 8 year sentence, did 13 months in prison and have several felonies on my record. Been out 5 years now and am getting my life straightened out. 

It's made it harder on me but I don't think if I had it to do over that I wouldn't do it. If you could go back in time to when you started, would you do it again? "
193,"I've had both, along with border collies. And if you want a job done right, blue heelers, however Australian shepherds are cute as hell and make really good gopher hunters."
194,"No questions, really. I just want to say hello to a fellow BKA. I’m not a vet. My ankle was crushed in a car accident in 2000. I spent 13 years in constant agony and surgeries until in 2013, when I was getting set to schedule an ankle replacement, I said “What if we just cut it off?”
Almost 5 years on and I’m SO happy I did it. 
But there are still times when it sucks.
I am a certified peer mentor, so I go hospitals and visit recent amputees and help answer their questions and fears. It helps me too.
I wish you all the best!"
195,"my fav position is doggy, or flat on my stomach. 

Fav encounter...idk I will have to think about that, remind me later. :) "
196,"Not OP but honestly the dope game teaches you alot. That is, the people who take it seriously and respect it. Taught me a lot about finances and human nature in general. But it's either a casket or a cell and people don't understand that. They think they can play both sides of the law but there's no such thing as half way crooks"
197,Can I stick my head out the window
