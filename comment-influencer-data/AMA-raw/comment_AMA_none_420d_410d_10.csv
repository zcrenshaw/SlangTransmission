5,"And THAT is what’s wrong with the system.  You didn’t get justice; you got robbed.  You’re out nearly 3 years of the median income in legal fees plus whatever the ongoing cost of lost income, reputational damage, plus pain and suffering.

But some folks will act like you’re lucky you’re not wrongly imprisoned.  

That is not how a free country should work. "

7,"Obviously it’s bad. It’s just a part of the past that we all have to accept, as shitty as it was there’s nothing we can do about it now."

9,"Don’t know who my biological father is, never met him. But yes, my mother knew. She was mentally disabled. Didn’t understand it was wrong. I see her as his victim too. 

But my grandparents started taking care of me after they found out. They didn’t want to believe my mother was disabled and unfit to care for a child, but after that they took over custody. "
10,"Did you lick your fingers frequently throughout, or wait until the end and lick them once?"
11,Genocide?
12,"You should crosspost your info onto r/UnresolvedMysteries. Also, I’m sorry that he hasn’t been found. 

What do you think may have happened?"
13,What does it feel like to have a whole pickle put up inside you?
14,"The foreplay went on forever.  That was perhaps the most fun part.  Lots of licking and kissing.

At one point, she put on a strap on and told me that she wanted to ‘remind me of old times’.  She preceded to pound me like she was a guy.  

Something about seeing another woman going in and out like a dude really turned me on.  We talked and we want to make the strap on a regular part of our sex life:)

Other than that, we each did a little bit of scissoring.  Nothing too crazy.  It was an amazing experience though!"
15,What's your opinion on free will?
16,"What, in your opinion, is the best thing the colonizers did?"
17,On a scale of 1 to 10. How much would you say you enjoy getting pissed on? 
18,Probably at about... 16 months?
19,"I've got a few questions.

**On religion:**

When you were a neo-nazi sympathizer, were you, were you religious? (I'm going to assume that you wpuld be christian) if so, how did you concile your views with the ""love your neighbours"" thing?

Are you still religious?

**On Europe:**

What was your opinion on the European Union (regarding economy, or the way to take care of the migrant crisis)? Has it changed much since then?

What did you think about Brexit?

**On homosexuality:**

What did you think of gay couples? Has your view changed?

**On women:**

Would you have said that it was normal that men and women were treated differently? If so, has your view changed on that subject?"
20,Throughout.
21,That's not survival that's just waiting outside with your stuff.
22,Which part of the dueling banjos song do you prefer to play?
23,"Just carried on as normal, like 2/3rds of my friends eventually went nude at least once which is really cool. "
24,Cheetah. I love their long ass tails and how lanky they are!
25,asking the important questions
26,It feels marvelous
27,22
28,Dude turned you into a furry.
29,"Yes, when I was 6, my stepfather locked us in the trailer &amp; set it on fire. We escaped and she finally left him. She had some sense, just not enough to take care of a child, or herself really. "

31,What age should kids be expected to get a job and help with bringing money into the household? 
32,Vomit
33,"""Leggings are pants now."" 

Lol this literally blows my mind on a regular basis.  "
34,"It was a very long process rather than a quick realization. I gradually realized that some claims were stupid once I stopped visiting websites, watching videos and talking to people who reinforced my beliefs.

There were a lot of contradicting ""facts"" and you had to actively ignore those contradictions.

Also, I started to experience through my own life that almost all claims were untrue."
35,What turns you on?
36,At what age should people be allowed to do porn
37,"As a descendant of survivors, Holocaust denial is both offensive and scary.

Unfortunately it continues to become more and more of a mainstream viewpoint, despite of the power of the internet. At the same time the last remaining survivors are very old and are dying off.

What do you think can be done to educate those who don’t know and refuse to believe?"

41,what do you mean when you said that nothing came out of questioning the friend about taking down the posters? Why was the friend taking them down? 
42,Why were you prisoned and did prison changed your personality?
43,"Hey, thanks so much.  I'm new to this site and hope to share about my ventures now as a singer/songwriter.  I just put up a video and song about GLOW with photos of the actual ladies and all that.  I don't want to break any rules sharing it, but would love for you and other fans to see it too. :)  I was the mean Russian, Major Tanya in the original GLOW."
44,"An adoption agency gave you to a cult? Did they hide the fact that they were a cult when they were working w the agency (I’m assuming they did, just curious)? What are you doing for work now? Did you get an education w the cult? Also, thank you for sharing! "
45,"Do you think the prison system ""works"" for rehabilitation or does it only function for punishment?"
46,"This is one of the contradictions that got me thinking that the whole idea of the far right is wrong.

If the white christians were supposed to be superior to any other we would surely rule the world, right?

I never resolved this conflict in my head at the time but actively suppressed it."

50,"If given any option at all, who would you have sex with?"
51,"Oh this is a fun question.  I just did a LOL.  You realize I was the Russian Heal?  I had a surprising experience on tour in the Deep South.  They took their wrestling very serious in the late 80’s.  I thought the director was joking when it suggested I stay in the hotel in this town.  “There are threats to take out the Russian so she can’t win her match.” (Paraphrased all these years later.)  But I had to get out, stretch my legs and found out I really was in danger.  A pick-up truck with a group of young men (rednecks?)  Blocked the street where I was walking and pulled out their shotguns from the truck bed.  They said something to the extent of “you had better not be winin’ any match in our town...”  I had the main event match with the American sweethearts in the live GLOW tour. 
Happier times in Las Vegas, where the regulars had a cheering section and signs for Major Tanya. :)"
52,"1) My assumption is based on family history. It was my second cousin who accused me, most likely controlled and tutored by my cousin and her husband. Husband has an abuse history where he would beat my cousin, and my dad frequently intervened. He tried accusing my dad of the same thing, but no arrests were made, becuase my dad works very closely with CPD and APS (Child Protective Services and Adult Protective Services)

2) My Second Cousin, daughter of my first cousin

3) She could not Identify, in court, who touched her. The Specific question, which was asked over 5 times, was, ""Is the person who touched you in this court room today?"" ""No.""

4) Riccota. "
53,I wear an apron for that lol
54,That's what lead to the trial. 
55,"Yes, they had a set up to surprise Mt. Fiji with as many of the ladies they to get to show up in Orange County.  I was uncertain at first, because the way the show had broke up and all the years of other strange rumors...but in reality, it was really fun.  We took a bunch of photos and goofed around.  Noticed how we all looked different and the same....older.  Best of all was how HAPPY it made Mt. Fiji!"
56,"Just laying around the house, never really had to. At a resort or something, just wrap a towel around or jump in the water if there's some nearby. I wouldn't say muscular just normal people in average shape. And babies did wear diapers lol"
57,"No replies, must have already got caught. "
58,My attorney cost roughly 120 to 150k. 
59,"Her family is very accepting.  They have known since she was 9 that she liked girls. 

My family is very religious, but they have surprised me and completely supported me without any issues.  I’m sure they don’t see it as ‘right’ and they probably pray over me about it but they have never thrown stones at me and they treat her like they would treat any old boyfriend.  For that I respect the hell out of them.  "
60,I think it sounds great actually. You should be proud
61,Sure did. Had to make sure my answers weren't too cheesy.
62,What things annoy you about people to the point of violence? 
63,"I first hit the outside world when I hit high school (homeschooled before that) What suprised me was peoples priorities were focused on self like careers, girls (which is ironic yes) cars etc when I was raised it was about working to survive and helping others"
64,Why the hell would you want to walk around with a towel in your hand in your home? Much more convenient to wear underwear. 
65,"Yes, thank you! It was a long, and tough journey. Many years of therapy. 

Jail, last time I checked. He abused/trafficked other kids, who came out against him. I wished I had too, I started filing a case but my gramma convinced me that I couldn’t emotionally handle it at the time. Now the statue of limitations is up. "
66,Charachteristics. Helping others in need. Not being selfish.
67,"Yeah they hid it. I manage a call center, yeah we got an education, but we also got taught how to get a job, manage money well and stuff like that. "
68,Did your birth parents know what he was doing?
69,[deleted]
70,"What exactly did you do? It may sound strange but I am curious 
Don't need to answer"
71,"Sex trafficking is when someone else makes a profit from someone else’s body. 

My stepfather would take me places or have men over who would rape me then give him money or drugs. 

Basically forced prostitution. "
72,"We didnt escape, we stopped going to temple meetings and left our temple lodgings, and pretty much have had no contact with any of our former sect members apart from very little from the family."
73,"I have :)

Thank you, I hope we know what happened one day, but people are dying off pretty quick there from old age, disease, etc... 

I think he was murdered... why or by who I don't know."
74,"Unfortunately my most recent was January. Before that though, it had been 7 years. I entered into a very severe psychotic mixed episode, and impulsively overdosed when my fiancé and I got into a fight. Feeling much better now though! 

Actually I coped by being a bit of a slut in high school. I thought if I slept with this guy, maybe I’ll feel loved. So I slept with my fiancé on the first date. The thing is though, I never actually enjoyed sex or orgasmed until I fell in love with my fiancé and we started actually making love instead of just fucking. Now I rather enjoy sex with him, it’s not difficult. 

He abused other kids that put him away. He’s a repeat offender, know of at least 2 other people. 

He locked my mother and I in the trailer and set it on fire. She finally left him after that. We went to live with my grandparents, who took over my care after it came out my mother let him abuse me. "
75,"Don't sweat the labels. Just be who you are and go where that takes you.

You said you're 19, so you've probably already experienced this, but you'll find that over the course of your life that many people, friends and strangers alike, will try to tell you who you are. That doesn't go away as you get older. I'm in my mid 30s and people still do it to me. They don't always mean any harm by it, but you shouldn't let them in any case. You know better who you are."
76,"""Shit situation"" ..... he killed someone. It's not like he was dealt a bad hand or anything. He did this to himself. "
77,I fuck dogs.
78,"Lol, sex as a whole is awkward, isn’t it?  Letting everything happen organically is what makes it so fun.  A planned out sex life would be so boring and lifeless.  "
79,Going home and watching tv
80,Congratulations! Why were you accused? Who accused you? On what evidence were you found not guilty? What’s your favorite type of cheese?
81,Proof ? Send nudes 
82,Less fucks given about body image and self esteem and i think a more healthy attitude to nudity and sexuality. And less laundry i guess :P
83,"You're doing an overnight, with bivouac gear, food, and water.   Where did you acquire such bravery to take this on? "
84,"I'm 43.  And one of my best memories of youth was watching G.L.O.W. Late Friday or Saturday nights at a friends house in the mid to late 80's.  Loved it.

Thanks for the memories!  Who are you then?  Not sure I'd remember at this point but definitely interested."
85,"A lot of the Netflix GLOW resembles the feel and oddness of it. The dirty gym/wharehouse; out-of-work young women; variety of personalities and shapes and sizes; no prior wrestling experience.  They of course have fictionalized the characters and placed it in the San Fernando Valley.  It was directly a part of the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, and that creatates a completely different set of problems and interactions. This is too general a question. 'Cause the experience was filled with surprises.
"
86,"If you had to choose between helping someone in a life threatening situation or watching TV, what would you do?"
87,I told you to lock the door boy! 
88,Never!
89,"Was the prison as racially segregated as it’s usually portrayed on tv? Maybe this is a dumb question, but mostly I’m curious if white inmates can get by okay without teaming up with white supremacists. "
90,How did you reconcile the notion of whites being superior to other races with the idea of Jews dominating the world in spite of making up a much smaller percentage of the human population?
91,I agree. Specially seems how the state never bothered to follow other leads. but State is immune so ... -shrug-
92,"What surprised you and your family most about the ""outside world"" once you got out or did you already know much about the rest of the world? "
93,[deleted]
94,What did you always think about doing once you got out? 
95,"You outta wear foot protection, especially if you’re using a George Forman grill for cooking.  I heard a guy once grilled his foot on one of those, tragic."
96,"They never involved my sister and I in the investigation, we literally were not questioned about our dad until 2013, he disappeared in 1999.  So, I only know that he was caught on video taking them down, and his reasoning wasn't significant enough to charge him with anything... this was early in the investigation too... so I don't believe the case was even with the CBI at that point and still was with Montrose County."
97,"I'm disappointed in you

While you were eating it did you do that thing where you put a single noodle in your lips and blow and breathe through it?"
98,"I can relate to that since my great grandfather died in a Soviet camp. It's also sad that people outside of former Soviet influence deny the atrocities committed by the USSR.

Those who don't know about the Holocaust are easy to educate, just show them hard evidence in the form of historical articles, photos, documents.

Those who outright deny it are harder to convince since they believe that all the evidence are fabricated. The nazies made a good job (for their side) of burning and destroying hard evidence like documents and orders so there are relatively few of those from nazi government sources (to my understanding).

Maybe talking to people who lived during that era are a good way to change their mind. It is more and more difficult as time goes on and old people die, however.

My grandmother used to tell stories of how her Jewish neighbours were taken, friends gone missing, etc. While she was not Jewish herself, it was still a very scary experience for her which had an effect on me."
99,I haven’t noticed a difference.
100,"How was your connection to outside world in prison? What were the hobbies you did in prison?
 Sorry if any of my questions sound really stupid I dont know at all how is the life in prison"
101,"Most of the time yeah, obviously i told my friends about this in advance."
102,"&gt; I don’t speak for everybody, but I feel lesbian sex is more based on ‘emotions’.

I believe that this is the connection between to lovers that care for each other, whether it be heterosexual or homosexual. This is the bond that causes people to love each despite their flaws. It is this feeling that goes beyond ""the grass is greener"" concept. 

This AMA really tells me that you finally experienced the idea of true love, and that's a beautiful thing. Always remember this experience. 
"
103,How did you cure yourself?
104,"How do you feel about new reddit? I think I hate it.

Doesn't even fit in my fucking screen. Half of the screen is sitting over there on the right off the screen. Wtf???"
105,How did you handle friends coming over to visit as a kid?
106,Hard
107,"We got on with them ok, although they were true believers and very devout. We felt they would be happier staying. "
108,"Was the dildo a strap on?  Did you suck on it?  

Sincerely,

A perv"
109,Welcome to the bright side friend. We are so glad you made it.
110,Wasn't expecting this as a response!
111,"I had been in a long term relationship with a guy but he cheated and I was heartbroken.  Like always, she was there to help bring me back up after the devastation.  

One night, I had a dream that she had moved across the globe and we would never talk or see each other again.  I woke up in tears.  That was the morning I realized how much I adore this woman.  She has been there for me through the good and the bad, something nobody else in my life could honestly say they’ve done.

I told her about the dream later that day and she just gave me the biggest hug.  I never wanted to let go.  This was the one person who I truly couldn’t live without.  I don’t know if I’d even be alive if it wasn’t for her emotional support over the high school &amp; young adult years.

Then, it kinda just happened.  Everyday, she was on my mind.  I knew that she liked me because some other friends had told me a few years back that she was ‘totally into me’.  I started developing feelings for her.  Every time I saw her, I thought about how amazing it would be to spend the rest of my life with her by my side.

A few months later, I told her how I felt.  She seemed so happy to know that she actually had a chance with me.  We shared our first kiss that night as I left her house.  It happened so naturally and it was the moment I realized I officially had fallen for her."
112,Describe yourself when your grandma walks in the room
113,[deleted]
114,It's the survival equivalent of doing one pushup and calling it a workout.
115,"We didn't want to stay, We didn't believe in the cults beliefs and wanted to live normal lives. "
116,"I don't know... I swing that way probably because it's the only likelihood we have to go off of.  But could he have removed the posted because of hatred and the hope that he's never found?  Maybe.  I just think that accusation is something serious and to verbally say it out loud to someone, at someone, even an insinuation, is a serious deal.  Peoples lives have seriously been effed up from wrongful convictions.  I want to be CERTAIN.  Was it a dick move to remove the posters, totally.  Total dick move.  Am I angry about it, I still am angry about it, but I get a little satisfaction knowing that EVERYONE and I mean everyone in that town knows he was taking them down.

"
117,"Also, was there any 7up left in the bottle or was it empty?"
118,"Holy shit, when you spelled it out like that the magnitude of evil just hit me. Sex trafficking really doesn’t hit the way that description did.
I am genuinely so sorry that you had to live through that. Your stepfather makes me question my position on the death sentence. "
119,Depends on the crime.
120,[deleted]
121,[deleted]
122,"Not at all, which is why it was so interesting and raw and unproffessional.  We were so young and niave and willing to try anything."
123,How much money did the lawyers make?
124,What have you accomplished with your 98 days of freedom?
125,"We didn't want to do it. Marriages within the cult were always arranged. We were given a room within a house called a temple lodging until we could provide for ourselves. We were expected to sleep in the same bed. My wife wasn't comfortable with sex, but eventually we had to do it, because we would need to engage in sexual temple rituals and we would be severely punished if we were virgins after a month of marriage.

It wasnt all bad. We both came to really love each other.  We had friends in the lodging and were homeschooled together, so part of it also was living with your friends when you're a teen. 

We left when we were in our early 20s and there was allegations of abuse and corruption by the chief druid and an incident that another couple was split up for the woman to marry a member of his inner circle. So we left"
126,"Hey thanks for asking about my music video/orignal song for GLOW.  You can view it at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqp5F9px3bA
"
127,Sneaking off in the night. Get picked up by a college friend on the highway. not that hard
128,"No I do not.  Although, that almost changed for me back a few years.  A man contacted me on facebook with pictures of a homeless man who looked quite a bit like my dad, although skinnier, taller... but some resemblance.  He even said his name was Dale Williams.  It turns out it was not him tho."
129,[deleted]
130,[deleted]
131,What do women do when they are on their period? Like an unexpected heavy flow or something? 
132,Did you make eye contact with the intruder?
133,"I was allowed to attend college, and I found an anti cult organization and they helped us. We basically organized to meet on the highway, met and drove off"
134,What are your thoughts on murderers and rapists being freed long before a low level drug dealer?
135,[deleted]
136,[deleted]
137,It disturbs me greatly that at least 20 people thought that was a reasonable question. 
138,"Yes, mainly when I was older, 5 and 6. 
I’d be afraid to trigger someone if I get too graphic though... 

I’ll relay in little detail my worst night. 

I was about 5. My mother was at work one evening. It started with just one John, we were in my bedroom. But before he could even get started (was just kissing me at first) , there was a knock at the door. The John gets up and leaves. I hear men talking and laughing. I get scared and hide under my bed. Then my stepfather busts in, he looks around and finds me hiding. I very vividly remember his face looking at mine under the bed. I was terrified.He grabs me by my arm and drags me into the kitchen. There there are 4 other men. My stepfather raises me up and tells me to dance for everyone. I tell him no. He takes his cigarette and puts it out on my arm, I scream, and start half-heartedly dancing. Next thing I know all 5 of them are on me, the Johns and my stepfather. I don’t think I need to go into any more detail than that. 

That was probably the worst night of my life. "
139,How did your wife feel about the other two?  
140,"Correct. A lot of people think jail and prison are the same, they are not. 

Jail = Waiting for their trial
Prison = Serving out their Sentence. 

I learned this as I was being locked up. The purpose of jail is to make sure you get to court for your trial, as stupid as it sounds. "
141,"Your first question has come up before a lot and nudists usually carry towels around to sit on, at least they do at resorts and shit, so I'd hope they do that at home as well."
142,[deleted]
143,"Or, you know, there's bisexuality."
144,"I recently watched the documentary on Netflix about the real GLOW.  Did you attend the reunion that was filmed for it?  If so, how did you feel meeting up with everyone again?"
145,"A cult, worshipping ""the old gods,"" with druids and some wicca? Arranged child marriages and sex rituals? Do you realize that these are serious allegations that need to be made public? "
146,Thank you! I'm still in the process of sorting some things out but it's very liberating to live without the constant stress and hatred.
147,"Joy. Ironic, no? Haha"
148,"Nope, just too lazy to grab a spoon."
149,"I have very little contact with anyone from there, I do not have any kids by them. "
150,"1. Definitely watch Hot Girls Wanted on Netflix 
2. Consider doing a private Snapchat that people have to pay for and cam. You’ll make way more money in way shorter time, you actually get to control what you do, and you can do it all on your own time. "
151,What’s it like working in heaven on earth?
152,Miss my friends and family.
153,[deleted]
154,"I don’t speak for everybody, but I feel lesbian sex is more based on ‘emotions’.

I felt the true love for my partner as we were getting it on.  The actual sex was more like a secondary thing, the emotional connection between us was amazing.  The kissing and licking each other seemed so much more personal compared to when I would do it with a guy.  

Sex with guys was good but I never felt the ‘love’ like I did with my partner.  It was more ‘pleasurable’.  "
155,"Dang, was your mother able to get out of that relationship?"
156,Sorry to hear this but its way better hearing that you fought through all of it. Is your step father in jail or dead?
157,I reasoned that I’d never done it before so I’d best try it. I’m a bucket list kinda guy. 
158,"Obviously when i'm out in public i'll have clothes with pockets, but at home you just get used to leaving your phone/wallet down or picking it up when you're going somewhere new. I will sometimes catch myself carrying my phone or something in my hand even when i'm wearing clothes though just out of habit. "
159,"Just let it happen.  I was petrified too.  At the end of the day, sex is silly.  It shouldn’t be taken too seriously, especially with another girl.  It’s not like someone’s gonna get pregnant:)

Over thinking it will add more stress and ruin your first experience.  If you just go into it with an open mind and naturally let it happen then it will be the greatest thing you’ve ever experienced , I promise!
"
160,Yes and yes.
161,"Yea that seems very suspicious to me, I'm curious what his reasoning was."
162,Lmao
163,You already have a drug problem or just aspire to have one?

169,Word on the street is that you steal people’s dog poop straight outta their backyards and take it home to eat. They’re calling you the Scat Bandit. Do you prepare it at all or just eat it straight?

171,"I don't have a question I just want to say it's fucking huge that you have a place, a job, and are getting ready to go back to school. Im very sincerely happy to know you're doing so well after such a shit situation and wish you ongoing success. 

Be proud of where you are, and remember to give back when you can."
172,So your parents stayed nude while your friends came over? 
173,What are the age gaps here?? Why did they divorce?? Why did the grandma swoop in on that?? How uncomfortable would everyone be if you made a joke about taste in men being an inherited trait in the family??
174,Fuck you. That's not a choice. That's three choices! Pick ONE! 
175,so you have an actual uncle Grandpa?
176,It’s so much fun! The dogs are so goofy when they’re all together and the main part of the job is just cleaning up after them and making sure they don’t kill each other lol

190,"I was living a totally normal life, happy and seemingly healthy.. I remember waking up on Friday morning and I felt an excruciating pain in my lower right abdomen. I remember that when I stood up to go to the bathroom I felt nauseous it hurt so bad. I was flirting with the idea of calling into work, but told myself it was fine and I was being ridiculous. (I am a department lead so calling into work always made me guilty) 

I went into work and found myself hunched over my podium from pain, still ignoring it. 

Saturday evening, the pain had grown to a new level, it had me screaming and crying — i was certain it was apendicitis so I had my brother take me to the ER. 

The ER doctor agreed that everything I was experiencing lent to appendicitis (and if not, gas.. lol), so without hesitation, they sent me for a CT scan. 

Poor medical student who was shadowing my ER doctor, I’m pretty sure it was the first time she ever had to be part of a “soo you probably have cancer, not appendicitis” conversation.

My first response to the news was “well, I’m glad it wasn’t gas, I sure would’ve looked stupid” it takes 10 seconds to really set in I swear! "
191,"I am extremely sorry to hear of your loss. It’s a terrible feeling of anger to know the pain caused by an uncontrollable entity. I hope that you and your family are recovering from that tragedy the best you can. 

My initial reaction was sorrow. It affected me here and there — baby pictures and videos are now triggers. I was able to let go of it a little bit (or stuff it deep inside of my core, rather) however, halfway through my treatments I began hanging out with a guy from work and we fell in love. The sort of love that makes every love I’ve ever felt before feel artificial. It was feeling that I met the love of my life, and looking into his beautiful eyes that made me feel stricken with intense grief that I wouldn’t be able to have children with him someday. It was a delayed reaction, really. I am still trying to overcome this, and I remind myself things like: there are countless children who need homes and people to love them, and instead of adding to the population I can help a child who really needs it. Whenever I sob violently and I think about THAT, it brings a smile to my face. 

Something I could consider a tragedy to my life I can see as a blessing, too."

198,"How awful :( I feel so sorry for that child for being manipulated like that, as well as for you. I see there’s any chance that child will be taken from that environment?"

 I had to look it up. Looks like a way for neo-hippies to get some free room and board while traveling. Not sure how OP didn't know he/she would need a work visa. Hell, one of the FAQs on the WWOOF website addresses work visas."
203,That ‘bitch’ still has a bigger dick than you’ll ever have.
204,I'm guessing that people probably won't be willing to share on this because of the privacy that reddit advocates. Most people remain anon on this site. I'm a paranormal investigator but I wouldn't share my website or specific details about my group for that reason. Anonymity. 
205,I had nothing to wash it down so it just kind of sat in the back of my throat.
