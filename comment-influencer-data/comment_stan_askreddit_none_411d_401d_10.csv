"I just watched [a documentary about Colleen Stan](http://documentaryheaven.com/girl-in-box/), who survived being kidnapped by a sexual sadist, who kept her in a coffin-sized box he built under his bed, 22 hours a day, for seven years while he raped and tortured her.

The ~~victim~~ survivor is the primary interviewee in the documentary and tells her story, on camera, for most of the documentary. The cops made mention of her bravery and ability withstand her torture, and manipulate her kidnapper to increase her safety."
"I work for a global company, and the Asian offices for whatever reason have their employees choose an ""American"" first name. At best, these folks have only a very basic understanding of English. Hilarity ensues.  


We get a lot of names like ""Coffee"" or ""Apple,"" plenty of ""Mickey"" and ""Minnie,"" but then there's some that make you scratch your head and wonder how the (American) corporate office okayed these choices. 


My personal favorites include: Gastlee, Smeagol, Christ, Lucifer, and Stan Lee, all of which I have received professional business emails from. 


But easily the best China name I've ever seen was an intern in Shanghai, who somehow got away with ""Eating Wang."" I have no doubt the kid knew exactly what he was doing."
