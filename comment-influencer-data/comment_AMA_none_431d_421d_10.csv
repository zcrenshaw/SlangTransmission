That’s what I said
Yea but not in a bag
Both
Woah
Under or over the shirt?
"Shadow banning (also called stealth banning, ghost banning or comment ghosting) is the act of blocking a user or their content from an online community such that the user does not realize that they have been banned. (Google)

Basically none of my posts or comments were visible by others yet there was no way to find out. My karma didn't count also."
Did it feel like a bag of sand when you're touching it?
Idk I’ve never felt a bag of sand before
Rude. I’m not even 20 yet...
"Here’s a tip. Post anything. And if someone doesn’t insult you in some way, you’re not being seen on reddit. "
I sure hope so!
After the boob play she turned toward me and put her arms around me and I put my hand down the back of her shorts and squeezed her ass while we dry humped eachother. That was about as far as we got before I got up to use the bathroom. When I came back out things really slowed down and I ended up giving her a back rub and then I fell asleep. I guess you could say I failed but I got as far as I wanted to so it’s whatever.
"I’m new to reddit, what is shadow banned? I can gather from context your comments/posts have to be manually reviewed but is that all? "
Does it still get wet? Or does it feel like fucking an old leather couch?
"I wondered why too. Its very frustrating though, you could be active writing so many comments on an online forum like reddit yet you are just scribbling text to yourself. Its like sitting alone in an empty room and talking to people through a sound proof glass."
Great AMA
Are you gonna do it again soon?
Yea I’d say so
never stop for a pit stop when you're full speed ahead to pound town
Like bags of sand? 
That’s the plan haha
Did it live up to the hype in your mind?
Pretty much. It was a lot firmer than I thought. I was expecting it to be really soft
No. Younger by 3 years.
"A moderator from a smaller sub I was active in pointed out that they had to approve all my posts and comments manually. I also realized the chat function has never worked for me, its only shown after I created a new account."

Yes
Asshole
I hate sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
Is she older than your mother? 
How have you found it being president of France?
Are you TheReportoftheWeek
ah yes. After escaping from a mile long cavern after two weeks I simply can’t wait to go on reddit to document my experience!
As far as I know. I’m actually recently enlisted into the Air Force so life’s doing well for me. Haven’t stopped moving since the incident since I feel I should live life to the fullest for those who lost that chance.
"I don't know, I've never touched one."
Oh shit. Ok guys this was fun but y’all can stop upvoting and asking questions now thanks
40 year old virgin
"I'm not on speaking terms with any of them apart from my twin sister, so I'm not sure they even know. My sister's not bothered by the age."
"I'm almost 19 and still haven't gotten there, so congrats from the other side, my brother. I hope to join you soon."
Trust me it was the right call...
did it feel like boobs
I realized once a man about 5 ft to my left he looked to be around 40-50 some years’ old had a bullet wound that was going up from his chin into his head with a blank stare on his face as what looked to be his wife was holding him. That’s when I knew I shouldn’t be there anymore.
"I'd say that wasn't failing in any way. You had an amazing time, and then you demonstrated that you're not just interested in grinding on her all night long; you had some calm, nice, tender moments.

I think this will pay off, relationship-wise (whatever the relationship turns out to be; anyway, it's hard to see how this could be a bad thing)."
Have you ever heard of Kyle the cougar champion
Obvious mommy issues
Do you know what sand feels like?
What is that reference from again?
Was it everything you hoped it would be?
Firm?! Oh... I'm forgetting what it's like being 20. 
damn
Same girl?
More than I can count. Doesn’t help my sister was on doctor Phil so she’s exclusively considered to be an “actor” of sorts. And she’s also a half sister (different dads) so we have different last names so it doesn’t really help when I’ve tried to defend her multiple times on social media since she’s gotten a lot of death threats for supposedly “acting” out that she was a victim. I’ve actually had someone relate the fact I’ve lost my shoe to some Egyptian god named “shu” representing some god of whatever blah blah relating to Satan and the new world order or some crap. Most of all of them believe the whole incident to be faked and no one died which is in itself horrible and baffles me that something thinks the government could pull something of that scale off making it all some hoax. I can confirm she’s my sister and she definitely was in the shit with me as we were fired upon.
Steve Carell is OP confirmed
I mean I didn’t think people would want to hear every detail lol
"&gt; I often hear questions about being rich, that life is way better etc. I don't think thats true tho. 

Oh no bby what is u doin"
Does she have children older than you?
Username checks out. 
Did anything else happen ?
I think it is meant to avoid people immediately creating a new account and annoying everybody again. That is assuming that the person that got shadowbanned deserves that ban.
Your answers are kinda cold and salty even when people ask you a normal question. It seems you have defensive walls up because you know it's not a regular relationship. Being more chill about it would be less stressful.
I got my yearbook at the end of the year and I realized what a total fucking nerd I looked like. 
"Probably not, it would be hard to beat my level of enjoyment "
Another person lol
I’ve been waiting for you. Pepper jack 
Very happily married to a man that is gentle with my pain. We just welcomed our first child. 
I’m actually immortal
"35 married 13 years to a 63 y/o here

Good for you "
How did she stay 63 for 13 years?
"A couple of times I've been mistaken for her son, but we've had no major challenges so far."
"On a train. I struck up a conversation about how some of the views from the train were really nice, and the rest is history...."
Neither of us have any children.
have they met 
Good luck brother! If I can do it you can too!
F
Will my parents ever get back together
Thanks!
Wow. Wonder why specifically they don’t want you to know you’re banned? 
The same reason many other couples get together. 
"I did, in hindsight. I never saw it as finding them attractive though. I always assumed I just thought they were pretty because they were, not that I was actively attracted to them. A lot of heteronormativity went into that. I used to think attraction was when someone fit your criteria or when you thought they were cute. I didn’t realize attraction was physical and in your gut. 

I like to describe it as when you’re twelveish and suddenly you’re going through puberty and get the raw, physical feelings of attraction. That’s what happened with the co-worker. 

I personally find any sort of sexual attraction difficult unless I know the person. I think that’s what made the co-worker different. I knew her and was attracted to her. "
How did you find out?
"No idea, I've never trolled or spammed. Maybe my account was used to spam but I'll never find out."
"At what point did you realize what was happening? I’m sure there’s noise, panic, adrenaline, etc. I’m just wondering how far along until you realized you needed to get the fuck out of there? "
Balanced as all things should be
How did u discover reddit ? 
"Have you never found any other woman attractive prior to 23 years old? 

What's different about this co-worker? "
I don't
"I thought it was cool? I don’t know I just wanted to stand out at 14. I do regret it, it was only freshman year though."
I was mainly just thinking if I’m next. A sense of feeling that you’re uncertain whether or not you’re going to live isn’t a feeling I’d be able to explain but it is an intense emotion.
What does your family think? 
Oh no that’s not what I meant. 
"Followup question, do you know why you were shadow banned?"
OMG!  You’re awesome!  Do you feel sexy now?!  You must feel great!!!
Good luck!!
"I’ve known about it a long time and sometimes see it pop up in web search results. 

I think my cousin first told me about it years ago but I never looked into it until now."
"Would you rather fight 1 horse-sized duck, or 100 duck-sized horses?"
How did you two meet?
Was there some kind of immediate attraction or were you just initially being friendly. 
Me too thanks
I think she did. And if not it’s ok I liked it enough for the both of us haha
I hope that your best friend spreads your ass cheeks and shits inside of you.
Are you really or are you lying?
The tv was on we didn’t want to miss the show
1 horse sized duck
You OK?
"More importantly, how did I stay 35 for so long?"
"Not really. We love each other, and are willing to do whatever it takes for each other and help each other out, no matter how hard things get. I feel like I am willing and prepared to look after her if she develops issues typically associated with old age when she is older, even if I am still quite young at the time."
This is the best AMA I've ever read lol
"Fucking SWEET, right?!"
Roughly how many times did you beat the living fuck out of your dick before creating this ama?
bold move
At least one for every seat in the car plus an extra one up front
"I make 56,000 salary plus bonuses, so not great but cost of living is decently low here"
So you came in your pants? If so thats super normal. The first seveal times I fooled around with just touching that happened to me.
Cuddling 
"Not enough to measure up for the ones my dad gave me.

No I’m joking I didn’t get many beatings, but there was many looks and snickering about me down the halls."
Firm and warm
"Thats true. This is how I found out I was shadow banned, a mod pointed that out. Good guy."
"Even though we get most of our money from food sales, I honestly don't care if people sneak food in, as long as they take their trash with them. It sucks when people sneak in fast food and we have to take time cleaning stuff that we made nothing off of. No, but I do catch kids all the time who will buy tickets to a PG movie and try to sneak into a rated R movie."
Have any crackpots accused you of being a crisis actor?
I weighed myself last month at a loading dock. 
Can confirm. I’m a 36 year old woman that has nursed two babies and gained and lost 80 lbs with my last pregnancy. Firm boobs are a distant memory. 
"Without going into much detail if your not comfortable, do you know why he did this? Did he have a diagnosed issue? Where were you when it happened and have you moved on from it (how much has it affected your life since it happened)?

I know it’s not really the same, but I grew up without knowing my father, I’m 17 now and would love to know your perspective on life. 

Thanks. "
"Oh I'm sorry man I must've missed your reply. My favorite's Stilton, but I love and cherish all cheese.

I’m very introverted and not good with girls
More than likely a woman holding her dead husband or the panic/fear on everyone’s faces as they crouched down. I was in the “pit” on the west side which was particularly dangerous since it’s a dense crowd and closest to him so their was a lot of stuff going on in my area.
What is your social life like? Are your friends mostly older or younger? 
"If looks could kill then lock me up because I’m a serial killer...





Yes I know where the exit is."
Do you have proof you're not bullshitting? 
Yes! I feel much more attractive. I think guys agree lol
What happened with every detail? 2
Like mine but better in every way
Lol
"Shadowbanning is meant for trolls and spammers. If they were told they were shadow banned, then they'd just keep making new accounts and there'd be no point in shadow banning at all. Not saying OP was a troll or spammer, but that's the rationale behind it. "
Well it feels like a boob. 
Haha I thought most people wouldn’t care. I was expecting like 5 questions max
Really. I wish I was lying. 
What happened with every detail? 
Hell yea it was!
"It's pretty annoying, but my Dad was always asked if he was related to James, and he wanted to be able to say ""he's my son"", and that's pretty badass, so I get it."
"Irish comes from Celtic while English comes from Latin. It's very different from English and you wouldn't be able to understand what a person is talking about in Irish unless you know the language.

And yeah you're right, Ukrainian, Russian and Polish are super close, which is why I basically grew up speaking all 3 and why I know them so easily while it takes people years to learn it. Russian and Ukrainian have slightly different alphabets and pronunciations/spelling. Besides that they're almost identical"
In my opinion Sherlock Gnomes was bad.
"Every single day man and that's no lie.

I miss the power I would feel. Honestly the first few months into the addiction I felt like a superhero. Sadly I have to remind myself of the final few months where I tried to kill myself twice.. "
Mostly the right
"By maintaining professional relationships with my students and giving consistent reminders of what is and isn't appropriate in school.  So far I've only two incidents were I've had to speak to a student on the whole ""crush on me"" thing and they were quickly resolved"
"I also a man who teaches at an all-girls high school but no one has ever had a crush on me. Maybe you could try being in your late 40s, fat, bald, and unattractive. That’s really worked well for me at preventing crushes. "

I was shadow banned from all of reddit. Never had a single interaction. I just don't know why.
If she is on reddit and this goes front page will you be able to touch them again?
Welcome to Reddit 
"Sadly, no."
You know how.
Of course my friend. We are in this journey together and reddit is our spaceship. When you post something and people upvote your post you get more karma points. Some people steal other people’s posts/images and re post them a few days/weeks later with a different title so many people never saw the post before upvote the post and the reposter will be happy. 
"How a word is spelt doesn't necessarily mean it is pronounced that way. 

Make sure to never forget the fadas (little accents) as it could change the word. 

Learn your tenses and your verbs properly. I can't stress this enough, it makes learning 110% easier

Good luck mate! All the best!
How can you tell if you have been shadow banned? Asking for a friend
That was a concern when I first started teaching at the school.  But I've always taken extra precautions to ensure I don't find myself in a situation where I could be.
"No. I am not on speaking terms with family, apart from my twin sister."

Yes, that is true. Not sure how you found out because I paid a lot of money for that story to be buried.  I'm used to getting fired from jobs so I didn't take it too hard, I guess. "

"There was one lesson where we were discussing synonyms for angry.  One of my students said ""incensed"" I was about to repeat it and say it was a good word.  But by a slip of the tongue I said ""incest"".  Of course my class burst into uncontrollable laughter.  It took about five minutes to calm them all  down and get the lesson back on track."

"I started as a cleaner and ticket taker 5 years ago, then supervisor, and 1 no th ago I was promoted to manager! "
"First of all I have no physical contact with my students at all (which is pretty much common sense).  There's usually another teacher present if I need to speak to a student alone, but if not I keep the door of my classroom propped open so I'm in sight.  I don't discuss personal issues with my students, I leave that to the school councilor.  I also don't have facebook, twitter or any other social networking websites like that.  That's all the ones I can think of off the top of my head. "

What’s your favorite type of cheese?
Life as a whole. Whole reason I went to that concert was to get out and cope cause a month before my girlfriend of 3 years showed up at my door with a box full of my stuff and told me she doesn’t love me anymore with zero arguments and no buildup. So I went to try to get back on my feet and consequently just so happened to attend a front row seat to the largest mass shooting in modern US history. But ever since then I’ve realized life is a lot bigger than a breakup or most thing we consider problems when they’re nothing comparatively to what can happen.

"It was pretty decent. I’m not going to lie but, Jason is horrid live. His notes are extremely flat and out of tune with the songs.

My mother. She is still alive. 
I can see your comment so you're not shadow banned here.
Have you ever shown weird or out of the ordinary movies in the theater?. Also if you’ve gone to other theaters do you silently judge them for doing things badly?
"Don't worry. Until last year, I've never imagined I'd have a girlfriend and today here we are, 9 months in a relationship. She was my very first in everything and I'm 23, lol. Good luck and remember, getting laid is not a race."
