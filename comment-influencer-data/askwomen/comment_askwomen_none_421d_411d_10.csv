"I used to deliver pizza had a guy slam the door in my face and said he was never ordering again....

Next week he ordered, so I shook his soda up before I gave it to him. "
"A proposal.

Seriously people, don't propose at someone else's wedding. "
"My suspicions are raised if he's overly impressed by mediocre achievements by women as if he hadn't imagined a woman could do that. Like changing a tyre, winning a video game, lifting weights etc."
"I met a really cute and sweet guy when I was 18 and just starting college. At the time, I was still hung up on a guy from my past who I thought was ""the one,"" but since I wasn't ready for that, I figured I could have a fun diversion with the cute guy.

I started seeing the new guy and we both treated it like it was temporary. We didn't make an effort to get to know each other's families or friends. We'd spend nights together but rarely talk during the day. He was quite explicit that this was just us having fun. ""It's not like we're getting married some day or anything."" I agreed. When I thought about the future, he wasn't in it.

After a while, I noticed more and more pieces of him I liked. He was honest, loyal, dependable, smart, and complex. I realized I was falling in love with him. That wasn't the plan, especially when I still hadn't figured things out with that guy I got hung up on. I confessed I was developing feelings and our lives got a little more entangled, but it felt good. We went exclusive.

He challenged me to be the best version of myself. I worked harder around him, I tried more new things, and I tried to be a better person. His friends and my friends became our friends. We spent time with each other's families. Our lives meshed well together.

Then, suddenly, we realized we had graduated college and had only dated each other.  And now that college was over and we were starting our careers, we were moving far away from each other and we were never supposed to have gotten this serious.

We broke up.

I was miserable. The guy I had been so hung up on before my relationship started? Now that I was single, he and I talked, but the magic wasn't there so we both moved on (his ""the one"" was someone else). I dated around. I made mistakes. I realized I was absolutely miserable.

A year after our break up I told my ""non-serious"" fling that I had messed everything up. He told me he still loved me too.

We're married now. He was ""the one"" all along. My expectations had simply made me too blind to see it.

**EDIT:** I wanted to clarify that this only worked out because we both wanted the same thing at the same time. We both wanted casual when it was casual. We both wanted serious when it got serious. Communication between us was key.

Also, don't lie to yourself about what you really want. (You could save yourself that one year breakup)"

"I was a research assistant when I was 21 or 22. My boss hired a giant fucking creep in his 50s, a returning student, onto the project. He seemed ok the first couple days. Way too chatty but sort of interesting and he loaned me a couple philosophy books relating to our conversation. But he started saying things that were more and more sexual and inappropriate. One day he shut the door to our shared office and told me about many disgusting sexual exploits including seducing the 15 year old daughter of his former boss, showing me his nipple rings, and bragging about his cock. He put his hand between his legs and squeezed his dick against it while he talked. I was extremely shy and didn't know what to do to make him stop.

At lunch time I went and told my boss. He fired him immediately.

A few weeks later the creep emailed me telling me I still had his library books and to give them back immediately or he was going to be charged hundreds of dollars each or not allowed to graduate.  I ignored the emails. He found my dad's email address and sent him a note telling him his sl*t daughter had his books and to make her return them.

I told my dad I had no idea what books he was talking about, then went outside my apartment and threw them in the dumpster."

"Pointed dismissiveness, generally.  

Treating what I or any woman has to say as fluff and nonsense, when hearing it at all.

Read an example on this thread about an asshole who would tap a drink glass at dinner to remind his wife that the men were speaking now.

The less blatant form of it can be demonstrated by talking to my partner instead of me.  Responding to my (silent) partner instead of me in conversation.  Think contractor engaged for work on my house, my property and being paid entirely by me to fix it, who brightens, relaxes, and speaks more with the male half of the partnership, going so far as to speak over my shoulder at the male half of the partnership who is passing through the room and not at all involved in the conversation or business at hand.  Because he can’t handle a woman being the property owner and arranging for work to be done on it? Can happen with car mechanics too.

"Brother visited with my niece for about a week.  My ex and I (when I was seventeen) decided to take my niece out for a full day of fun activities in St. Louis (since most of the stuff is free except parking).  This included the Science Center, the Zoo, lunch, and then Forest Park.  Meanwhile, Brother was going to go gamble and drink with his friends all day long.

Brother (who is twenty plus years older than me) pulls me aside and basically threatens, in a very real way, to kill me if anything happens to her.  He goes on and on about how she's a ""beautiful little girl.  Like, Top Model beautiful."". He then goes on to say a lot of men would love to snatch her up so I can't take my eyes off her for one second.  If she goes to the bathroom, I HAVE to go into the same stall as her to make sure and she is NEVER to leave my sight, ever, because she is a very beautiful 6 year old child.  And if she comes back saying she's hungry, then I'm getting my ass ripped up for that one too because I'm fully responsible for her.

It went on for about twenty minutes before he started threatening my life, reminding me how he fought in the Gulf War and was no stranger to violence, etc.

Finally, he let me go so I could grab my niece and head out.  Later found out, talking to my parents, that they had NO IDEA he had done that to me and, if they had, they would have told him to get out of our house for threatening my life like that.  

Thankfully, my niece grew up to be a really well rounded woman and very levelheaded despite her insane dad.  She still speaks fondly about how fun that day was and how she's really grateful I let her go into the bathroom stall on her own, haha!"
"High school friend/FWB and I stopped hanging out after graduation(long story short, we both had feelings but it didn't work out). Just before I went away to college we talked on the phone for the first time in 2 months and he said ""no matter who we date in between, we're gonna get married"". Rolled my eyes and blew it off, didn't really talk to him again for several years. 

Time jump 10 years, we got married. "

"In a 15 mile stretch of freeway, in the middle of the night, I blew 2 tires and my fuel pump completely went out, stranding me on I-15 somewhere in Wyoming. (This did not all happen at once...first one tire, a few miles later the other tire, and then the fuel pump. On a 3 year old car with just 40,000 miles)  

Edit: Also, forgot to add, after the first blown tire, a small group of bikers pulled up and stayed with me until my roadside assistance showed up (even though it took over an hour), because they said it wasn't safe for me all alone. Nicest group of people I've ever come across. "

Probably the insults from people driving by in cars. Most of the time it's when I've been walking into a store from the parking lot but one day I was in my garage painting a dresser with the garage door open and it was people driving by my house. There's just something extra insidious about it when you're just minding your business at home.

"I had a friend who threw me away and talked shit about me over a huge ordeal she caused and I actually had minimal involvement in at all. Several months after this, I guess she and her boyfriend were breaking up and there was a giant custody battle going on. She called me and asked to back her up in court, and she knew she was wrong to put me through what did, but she couldn't lose custody of her son. She also said she knew I wanted to help him stay with his mom because I always did right by him. I told her I didn't give a flying fuck about what happened to her kid or if she lost custody after the crap she pulled, and that I certainly didn't have time to get wrapped up in some legal battle I couldn't have cared less about. She started bawling and I hung up on her.

Her ex got custody of the kid, and it was really the best thing that could have happened. No kid should be raised by a self-centered jerk with the maturity level of a high school freshmen."
"Yeah. And while we’re on the subject, don’t announce pregnancies at one, either. "
"I don't approach dating as though the only way it can succeed is to grow old and die together. I see being with people for seasons, for years, for decades, equally.

I overstate this on reddit, but chapters end to progress a story and they are no less valuable or lovely for what the gave me and I them. I date as normal and sometimes an end date comes up. Sometimes it doesn't and blindsides us. There is no grand thought in my head, or a change to the way I date, or how we interact. It's more about how I  handle the fallout should it come. "
You have no idea how invested I was in your story. If you and him didn't end up together in the end I was going to storm out and demand my money back. Very happy to see it all worked out for you!

"I think this isn't even subtle but it's often overlooked. There's a big difference between casual sex and casual sex with a woman he doesn't like/respect. Obviously it takes time to get to know someone and people might realize they don't like someone *after* they had sex. But if he's saying bad things about a woman or you can tell he dislikes her beyond sex while he still continues to see her for sex, that shows both objectification and that he's leading her on as the chances of someone sleeping with someone who doesn't respect them are quite slim. So he probably never shared what he really thinks about her with her."

"You know how sometimes a woman will adjust the angle of piv and really start getting in to it but to you it just feels blah? 
Most of the time that’s what sex feels like for a woman, like okay, yeah this could be really good if I just tilted my hips this way. And then you do tilt your hips that way and it does feel amazing, but then he’ll adjust his tilt so that it feels amazing for him again but then it just feels like ‘almost stimulating’ for her again. 

And then they wonder why you didn’t come."
"A girl in middle school said something grossly anti-Semitic to me (I don't even remember exactly what, but it was essentially that you Jews would have deserved the Holocaust if it weren't a hoax), so I told her inside and out she's an ugly person and people avoid sitting near her because she smells like shit (which was the harsh truth). She was crying for the rest of the class and people looked at me like I was the worst human being to ever exist.

I could tell it wasn't theatrical crying and that what I said genuinely set off a nerve, but I regret nothing."
"My roommate asked if it would be alright for her sisters to stay over one Friday night. I was like sure ya that’s cool, just keep things clean and don’t go in my room. 

Turns out she has seven sisters. 

Three of which have dogs. 

Two of which have boyfriends. 

They ended up staying for five days, all nine people and three canines. On top of my roommate and her untrained dog. In the living room of our 600sqft apartment. 

They stayed out of my room at least. But one of the dogs got diarrhea and crapped everywhere. One of the dogs peed all over my rug. One of the sisters spilled an entire stout on my wood coffee table then left the house and locked herself out. 

They used every dish in the kitchen every day. I’d get home to cartoonish levels of dirty dishes on the sink, dog piles in the house, trash thrown everywhere. 

So yeah, them.

I kicked them out after day five, but my relationship with my roommate is still sour. "

"Was driving home from a long shift at work. Was summer, so I was working service because I teach during the year. 

This lady in front of me at a red light was clearly on her phone when it turned green, causing the person BEHIND ME to honk. She thought it was me, so literally drove (not even kidding) 4mph up the on ramp of the highway. 

There was a huge line of cars behind me, honking, and she was in front waving her arm out the window and cursing at me like a lunatic, all while driving so slow onto a rushing highway I thought I might die. I honked and told her to move or shed cause an accident. She then proceeded to take a DOG BOWL of change and hurl it at my car, leaving a scratch and dent. If it’d hit my windshield it would have cracked. 

Anyway. I rushed up around her on the left side, the merging lane had an opening and I took it. I just wanted to get around her. She came speeding up behind me, so at this point I thought I’d enjoy myself a bit. I slowed down and switched to the right lane so she could pull up next to me and yell whatever she wanted. 

I worked at a well known coffee place. And my husband requested the largest iced coffee with hazelnut we have. That’s 30oz of black coffee with sweet, sticky goodness, and no ice because I’m a nice wife. 

You bet your ass as soon as she pulled up, I took that 30oz coffee and threw it straight into her passenger side window, watching it explode beautifully all over her, her car, her windshield, her cloth seats. 

Coffee stains, my friends. And hazelnut syrup is sticky. "

"The Arctic is so named because it’s the area north of which you can see Ursa Major and Ursa Minor (The Big Bear and Little Bear) constellations in the night sky. It come from the Greek word that roughly translates as “Land of Bears”. 

When Antarctica was discovered - and being on the polar opposite side of the world to the Arctic - was named the Anti-Arctic. Therefore it’s name roughly translates as “Land of no Bears”.

In a happy coincidence you get actual bears (not just constellations) living in the Arctic and no bears living in Antarctica."
"Wedding photographer here. I hate it when the bride is walking down the aisle and everybody is looking at the back of their phones (or even iPads) instead of being in the moment with the couple. I’ve had brides burst into tears seeing their wedding photos when that’s what went on. I can crop like hell but it’s still tacky. I mean seriously, you think your crappy blurry iPhone photo is that important? The couple just spent a lot of good money hiring a photographer and possibly a videographer. Let us do what they hired us for.

This is not to say you shouldn’t take any photos at a wedding, but during those critical moments - walking up the aisle, first kiss, cutting cake, first dance - can you please give the pros time and space to get their shots before jumping all over them?

This has been a public service announcement from wedding and event photographers everywhere. Thank you!"

"Lol, my friends call me ""attachment Barbie"" because I have this same problem. A couple of things help me ""keep a distance"" at least in the beginning. 

For one, I do not sleep with the person until I'm nearly positive things are looking a bit more serious (this usually takes about 3 months). I can't do casual so taking time before being physically intimate with a person creates a little space. 

Second, I don't PRETEND I am a casual person. By a third/fourth date I've usually communicated that I'm not a casual dater and that's not what I'm looking for. Saves everyone a lot of time and me a lot of heartbreak.

Third, I take my damn time. Spreading out the dates over time (even though it means things progress slower) helps to create some distance and space. I know for me, I am always SUPER tempted to go out for dinner friday, then get brunch saturday (even with no sleepover) and then why not grab lunch on Sunday??? I do NOT do this. I space things out and it allows me time to slow down and not become overly invested if they aren't themselves.

"When I was about 19/20 I worked at a daycare, with a uniform, and took the train to work. I was on my way home way evening, minding my own business, when a group of 3 or 4 guys got on the train.

They got real specific, everything from my ""frumpy"" clothes, to my ""cheap"" handbag, my weight, my lack of makeup, basically anything they could think of to insult me.   
  
When I moved to a different area of the train car they followed me. One came right up next to me and tried to engage me in conversation about how ugly I am. I don't know why they picked me. I just remember feeling horrible, ugly and ashamed, afraid and wishing I could just die right there. People just avoided eye contact with me, nobody said anything, not even me. "

"MY SIL stays with us once or twice a year, for over a week at a time with my two twin nieces. Things have gotten better and they respect my boundaries now, however:

They stayed with us a week before my wedding, the week after (between our honeymoon, the biggest fight my husband and I ever had because WHO WANTS TO SPEND THE FIRST WEEK OF MARRIAGE WITH YOUR INLAWS), and they stayed the week we were gone (plus side of this was they watched our pets).  Reason: my other SIL's wedding shower was two weeks after my wedding and it was ""too much"" to deal with traveling back and forth. I think she needed a break from her lazy husband. ANyway, they decided to finally potty train their four year old twins at that time using the ""let's not put pants on them at all"" method while we were on our cruise. I came home from the airport, with a case of bronchitis and fever, wanting to go to bed, to watching my 4 year old niece literally squat in the middle of my kitchen and take a shit on the floor.

Potty train your kids in your own house, was what I snapped."

"This one time in high school I was at a small party and one of the people there was really drunk and didn't have a ride home, I offered her to stay at my place since it was a short walk from the party. The next morning we wake up, I'm about to go outside when my father comes out of his room and of course I just quickly introduce them and carry on going to my car to take her home. 

Now this girl is pansexual or something and looks very tomboyish, she's cool, I don't really know her that well but apparently my father thought I'd slept her her and he thinks she's a guy who looks kind of feminine? I never really asked him or care. 

So I get back from dropping her off and my father is in the living room crying with my mom holding him and she says ""your father is crying cause he thinks you're gay.""

I laughed in his face. After years of him making dumb jokes about me ""being gay"" and constantly harassing me from the age of 9 I couldn't help but not care. I could have been doing hard drugs, failing school, having a baby, something that actually mattered but he's worried about the thought of me liking other dudes?? He didn't care when he saw my cut scars on my wrists, or when I would beg him to stop drinking.

Thinking about it now I probably could've handled it better but honestly it was just so dumb that it felt like it had to be a joke. Still don't feel bad about it though.

During this time he was out of town visiting his parents, so he wasn’t home for like a week. While he was gone, said ex moved all her stuff back into his place and was living there for a few days. She left little apology notes all over his wall and was cleaning the place when the police came over "

"It's not hate but more a disdainful feeling, I just really dislike A LOT the new running shoes's look. The Kanye kind of shoes, those that look like it's made of old wool with a weird pointy rubbery sole.

Also, snap pants. They were cool in 96 but on some guys it did look ridiculous. In 2018 it's the same, plus the boys I see wearing them usually wear white socks and ugly shoes with it.

"My daughter. Even as a toddler, there's pressure for her to be feminine. I never push that social expectation. Wanna wear a Power Ranger shirt and swim trunks? Okay. You want action figures for your birthday? Awesome choice. You don't want to play dress up? We'll take the Tonka trucks to the back yard instead. 

I don't deny her feminine behavior, if she ever had any. But I don't expect it, unlike a lot of my family and society does. Little girls don't have to like princesses and playing house. I don't expect her to like it if she doesn't. She likes earrings and painting her nails, so I embrace that. But she also likes ninjas, bugs, super heros, and Ninja Turtles. I embrace that, too. I don't expect her to ""act like a girl,"" as my grandma would say. She is a girl, she'll enjoy what makes her happy, even if it's what you and society doesn't expect from a little girl. "

"Meanness to older women, clerks/waitresses/cashiers, lower-level co-workers. 

There are some dudes who put on their best behavior speaking to women they consider good looking, who they're dating or would like to date, and women in their work/field who have status, but are awful to every woman they encounter who they see as lower status than them.

The amount of bullying and contempt is multiplied by factors like x race, accent, or encountering a woman having a struggle or difficulty of any kind.

If he's nice to \*you\* but you see him being rotten to that older long-term employee, that waitress or cashier, and random women who he thinks of as ""lesser,"" believe that that's the core when the shiny paint is off.

To be even-handed, guys like this often do something similar with men they look down on, but they tend to be eager to impress or look good to most other guys, from colleagues to fellow dads to the mechanic at the garage, so the resentment gets dealt to a much broader swath of women."
"On the very first day I met my now husband I watched him dive into a river to save a little girl who was drowning. We met at a campground in Yosemite and were all hanging out next to the Merced when we saw a little girl who was clearly struggling bob past us. He just took off his shirt and dived in to save her, 2 minutes later her dad shows up very upset and so grateful. It was honestly like something from a Nicholas Sparks novel, ridiculously dramatic and how can anyone resist a guy who saves a child from drowning? To this day we joke that he slipped the little girl a $20 to pretend drown so he could impress me. 

Also later that night we drank sangria under the stars and he made me smores. Disgustingly romantic.  "

Well, let me tell ya, doc.  My future husband doesn’t want kids either.  I know, because we will have discussed it.  This future husband treats me like a human being with thoughts and agency of my own, not as a brood mare.  Otherwise we will never get married.

I didn't expect money or a maid or anything, but I did expect respect to my home and at least cleaning up after one self. I was very upset and they apologized but still... I would not let them stay with me again. "
"When I was in junior high school, we had to swim for gym class.  And I actually loved swimming at the time, I was on the swim team.  But then one day I overheard two girls talking in the next row of lockers over.

""Yeah, must be kinda like a whale!""

"Well, since niece looks at me as a role model and person she can trust with her best interests always, he tries to manipulate or guilt her through me.  Which doesn't ever work the way he wants.  He assumes she tells me nothing about their relationship, but she calls or texts me often about his behavior so I've established myself as the sister that will listen to his demands and then basically say, ""I'll do my best!"" and then do nothing.

He's incredibly antagonistic towards me when he doesn't need me to try to manipulate his only child for him.  Often times, he bad mouths me to my own parents (one of which is his step mother) about how I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth and he has nothing.  

To be fair, my mom is the one who made all the money in the family for a long time.  My dad stayed at home to raise my younger brother and I.  Brother (older) is from my dad's first marriage.  By the time he was enlisted in the Navy and off on his own, my dad was just about to marry my mom and my mom hadn't even started her career.  Her career didn't start to make any money until I was about eight or nine.  Once Brother saw how we were living (suddenly we had vacations and new clothes and stuff), he grew very antagonistic and spiteful to my younger brother and I even though we were only children.  It's just gotten worse the older we get because now he thinks he can attack my parents for it besides just making snide comments to younger brother and I.

Little does he know that both my parents have written him completely out of their wills and made me the executrix of the wills.  They divide everything between younger brother, Niece, and myself.  He gets an honorable mention with his comic book collection, which he visited recently to retrieve."

"War in the 6th century was usually a fairly brutal affair. When a city was captured, its people were often enslaved or killed. So when, during the Byzantine-Sassanian wars, Khosrau I of Persia successfully besieged Antioch, its inhabitants were understandably somewhat nervous.

However, rather than enslaving them or killing them, Khosrau brought the city's population in its entirety back to Persia and rebuilt them an almost exact replica of Antioch, down to the layout of the city and rooms in the houses. The people were freed and made into full Persian citizens.

The city was named ""Weh Antiok Khosrau"" - ""Khosrau's better Antioch"", and he took great pride in ensuring its continued prosperity."

"Gardening. I've always been more of an indoor kid, and gardening seemed like a sweaty, perpetual chore. But now that I've started, I've found that I actually love it! Yes, pulling weeds is a pretty constant chore, but when I put on a podcast and start pulling away, I find it soothing rather than tedious. And the results have made me so proud! "
"My ex was an asshole in many ways. Highlights: he once told a girl he didn’t even know, to her face, that she was too fat to wear shorts. He told me my naturally wavy hair was trashy and disgusting. He drove like a psycho and then justified it by bragging that his car was better than everyone else’s so he had a right to drive that way. He proudly proclaimed to be “racist against redheads”. 

The final straw was when I got pregnant, he flipped out on me and threatened me with bodily harm if I didn’t get an abortion, then when I was understandably upset after getting an abortion I didn’t want under fucked up circumstances, he told me I was being unreasonable and needed to just get over it. 

18-20 year old me was both naive and had low self esteem, so I managed to justify this behavior or tell myself this was ok. 21 year old me said nope, fuck this, I’m out. I can’t believe it took me that long, he wasn’t exactly shy about being an asshole when we met. "
The contractor thing really resonates with me.  I run large scale projects for my work and my husband is clueless about anything in that realm.  But the guy doing a minor job on my house doesn’t want to deal with me at all and can’t wait to talk to my clueless husband about it.  So annoying.

"I grew up in a pretty conservative household. My first car had a “Work Harder: Millions on Welfare Depend on You!” sticker. I thought poor people were lazy, and the government was full of a bunch of socialist bureaucrats sitting around trying to play Robin Hood with my money.  

Then I graduated from a top 20 university, into the middle of a recession. I worked 3 jobs, the main one being straight commission based, 70+ hours a week, and sometimes had to make a $0.20 packet of ramen noodles last for 2 meals. I had no health insurance, because none of my employers were required to provide it, and rent on a shared apartment in a seedy part of town was astronomical. As was the cost of rising insurance after replacing locks, and fixing my car after both got broken into.  

I learned pretty quickly that sometimes, no matter how hard you work, there are systemic failures working to keep you down. And it probably would have been worse if my skin wasn’t white.  

It still took reflection and growth to shed my “blame those below you” mentality, but I’m awful liberal these days. "

"Thought of another one: If he devalues/puts down jobs that are traditionally women's jobs.

Bonus points if he still disrespects women in fields traditionally occupied by men. One lesser-noticed way is that he may have higher standards for women in those fields-as in standards of what they must meet in order to be considered good at their jobs and not be insulted/patronized by him- than he does for men in those fields. Also whenever I say ""subtle"" it really depends on the person of course. I may find this or some instances of it really obvious but I know not everyone does. I think the reason I put it here is because like some other things, it's more overlooked than anything. People think ""well everyone makes fun of teachers because they don't make as much money, not because they're women"" or ""people look down on nurses because they're not doctors, not because they are women"" (which is still disrespectful regardless of why). But of course some of the stigma comes from the fact that those jobs were and often still are women-dominated fields."

"My sister isn’t on Reddit but it breaks my heart what people have the gall to say to her. In my culture only two things make a woman attractive: how skinny you are and how light (fair) your skin is. My sister unfortunately had neither of these as a pre-teen when playing outside and getting tan skin and acne was normal. 

She was playing with me when I was around 5 years old when an auntie stormed up to her and said, “maybe if you took better care of your sister and ran after her you’d lose some weight. No one will ever want to marry you if you look like that.” My sister was 12 years old for fucks sake. She grew up thinking she was ugly and received no affirmation from our parents for years. "

"You might want to talk to your parents to make sure they leave him a dollar or so so he can’t sue later. From what I’ve seen on /r/legaladvice, if they do something like that, he won’t be able to successfully sue on grounds that he was “forgotten” or that you manipulated your parents to write him out of the will."
"I'm not ""unattractive"" as an adult, but when I was in school I was fat and ugly. Some of the bad things that happened was guys coming up to tell me they liked me just to mess with me, then laugh at my reaction with their friends. Or if my name was brought up, they had to partner with me in something, etc, they'd laugh and go ""ew"". I remember I got put in a group for a project with this guy who spent like 50% of the time telling me I was disgusting and needed to go on a diet or no one would ever fuck me. I could keep going on but it would be a wall of text. "

He had backed up the toilet, didn't turn off the water, let it overflow and didn't say a word about it. Just left."
"So many ways.

Growing up, I felt a lot of pressure to act and behave a certain way. He pushed me to challenge my comfort zone and move outside that role. He encouraged and supported me trying new hobbies, new classes, and new activities. When I fell into old habits, he'd question why, which made me question why.

I also had a temper and would react poorly (hot headed, saying things I didn't mean, etc). That was a hard limit for him (which it should be. It was not the right way for me to handle conflict). So consequently I learned how to manage my outbursts until I stopped having them. I learned how to have a fight with him effectively (""I"" statements. Nothing accusatory or said simply out of anger. No name calling, trying to hurt him, etc).

Finally, he made me a more positive, happier person. If I ever say something negative about someone behind their back, he calls me out on it. He won't talk behind people's backs and it makes him uncomfortable and unhappy when people do it around him. Honestly, cutting out those negative thoughts made me a much happier, friendlier person to be around.

Basically he challenged me to work to change the parts of my personality I didn't like."

Also she did get into trouble with other people too hating her user ways. That catches up with you.  "

Then I met my husband, and he didn't mind me being me. Didn't mind how intense I was with my emotions, didn't mind my crazy PMS episodes, and he didn't mind me messaging him every chance I got. The relationship moved fast, but it was fine with the both of us.
Now we're learning to give each other more space so that each of us can work on building our careers. But whenever I want more attention and affection, he would give it to me."

On her way out her and her friend got into the lift in my sisters building. There was an older dude in the lift (my sister was only 22 and he was old enough to be her dad) and they made small talk. He commented on the fact they were going out on the town. Got out of the lift and my sister and her friend went out. 
Whilst at the club my sister met a guy and they had drinks etc and one thing lead to another. Shortly after they hooked up the dude realised my sister lived in the same building as his dad. When my sister met his dad she realised he was the same guy she met in the lift that night. 10 years on they have two kids and are happy married. So crazy she met his dad first. "

It was in a city a few hours from me so I made plans to go see it one weekend and brought my now-husband (then boyfriend) along. We show up and the landlord was REALLY put off by the fact it wasn't just me. He kept mentioning it, how I didn't say there would be two people, blah blah. I'm like man it's going to be just me living in the apartment, why do you care?

There were a gazillion other red flags, too: property size was much smaller than indicated online, it was attached to his house with a ""fire door"" in the adjacent wall that was really just a trap door, the landlord not caring about my rental history or employment but rather pushing me to move in right away. And when he kept being shady we left and he called me to say I needed to leave my boyfriend because apparently he was abusive and didn't want what was best for me. (My bf barely talked, except to back me up when I called the guy out on stuff.)

And if you mess up the routine one in a while, that’s okay, because you’re taking it one day at a time and tomorrow is a new day. "

"In 1960 my dad's parents were two teenagers who got knocked up. Being catholic they went through with the pregnancy, but they had to put him up for adoption before being sent across the country to different boarding schools as punishment. It seems neither spoke about it again. 50 years later my dad sought out his birth parents, spoke to both and arranged a meeting for all 3 of them. His parents met him and each other again, and they all planned to stay in contact. 


Turns out both his parents were recently widowed after decades of marriage, and both had multiple children and grandchildren and led fulfilling lives. I guess a flame was reignited because they fell in love again and are now back together. 


For my birthday one year they arranged a ""family union"" where nearly 100 people gathered to meet the families of my grandmother and grandfather. Because my dad was the key to bringing both families together, he and my brother and I were the guests of honor for the weekend stay on my grandfather's sizeable acreage, and we were treated like celebrities by tons of relatives I met throughout the weekend. My dad's adoptive parents have since passed away, but now he has been spending time getting to know his birth parents and visits them often at their farm in Alberta and ski condo in Montana. He seems to be having a blast and is always eager to tell us what's new with his parents (though we all call them by their first names).


For me the weirdest thing was meeting two complete strangers who look so extremely familiar to me, and being able to visualize how my dad will look when he is his father's age. I'd call it a fairy tale love story!"
"My Ex- He started screaming at me about what a horrible girlfriend I was and refused to spend the night with me after I found out my mother had a severe stroke. 

She died three day later. I broke up with him the day after her funeral over the phone. Then, he sent me a text saying ""I think you want to call me back and talk to me in a way that allows continue respecting you. I don't want to believe you're okay with that conversation"". Turns out, I was actually pretty okay it. "
I miss having a president who spoke in coherent sentences. This is so real. 
"I read a story awhile ago where a bride specifically asked the groom multiple times *not* to smash the cake in her face.  She wanted to look good for pictures and not get cake all down her expensive dress.  He did it anyway.  She cried and left, and in the following days got an annulment. 


People were trashing her decision, but really, I get it.  She asked her husband to do one thing, not embarrass her/ruin her effort that day, and he did it anyway.  That's a big boundary stomp.


Making people laugh was more important than his wife's feelings.  I'd be pissed too. "
"Anything that seems like it'd only be truly interesting if you had a fetish, or that is weirdly specific. For example: ""If you were 11ft tall and you met a tiny guy the size of your thumb who had brown hair and glasses, what would you do?""

I've gotta be real it does seem to be the same few fetishes that always crop up in these questions. It's always foot fetishists or giantess fetishists or crossdressing fetishists or incest fetishists. You never see, like, people who are really into balloon popping show up going ""What if you had to spend an hour in a room filled with thousands of balloons but all you had to wear was your all-spikes romper?"""
"We had a friend stay with us for about 3 months.  I discovered fairly quickly that Thursday was shower day.  He would go out and play frisbee golf in the heat most days (it was summer), but still only the once a week shower.  We threw away all the bedding he used when he left. The smell was unreal."

Jane and Jack are married. Jane and Jack are friends with another couple, Tom and Theresa. Jane and Jack have 3 kids. Tom and Theresa have 3 kids.

At some point, Jane and Jack get divorced.

A little while later, Tom and Theresa get divorced.

Jane starts dating and eventually marries Tom.

Jack starts dating and eventually marries Theresa.

Jack and Theresa end up having a child together. That child was my high school friend.

In short, the ex-husband of my friend’s mom was married to the ex-wife of my friend’s dad. And all of their kids were his half-siblings.

He liked to joke that he had a “very blended family.”

"A few years ago, I booked a two week solo trip to the Philippines for the sole purpose of scuba diving and beach bumming. I spent almost every morning diving (it was literally like Finding Nemo under the water) until about noon, then spent the afternoons reading on the beach.

Making friends. Or generally how people  can have a conversation with someone they've just met.  
"My grandmother would always “trick” me into going to church on Sunday by inviting me for a sleepover on Saturday night. 


My favorite aunt and uncle were also staying the weekend so when I was invited over I didn’t think anything of it. At dinner that evening grandma casually says “oh, and we’re going to 8:30 mass tomorrow.” 


I told her no, that I did want to go. Her response was “Fine. You can leave with [aunt] and [uncle] when they leave at 5:30 in the morning.” “Okay” was my reply. 


It was probably rude of me (I was 15) and impolite, but it was the first time I’d ever stood up for myself to her. I was tired of the repeated manipulation and didn’t want to deal with it anymore. 


That weekend my uncle backed me up, calmed my grandmother down, and talked her into letting me sleep in, so long as I promised to be out of the house by the time they got back from church. Dad picked me up at 9:00 instead. And my grandmother never forced me to go to church again. "
"Any kind of begging for money on behalf of the bride and groom. I’ve seen jars labeled “honeymoon fund” and jars saying bride and groom where guests put in cash and whoever gets more money gets cake shoved in their face during the reception. 

I also think long gaps between the ceremony and reception are tacky. Like a cocktail hour with food and drink are fine but making your guests wait four hours is not. "
"As part of a psychological study, I was told to write down three things that stressed me out and the research assistant would ask me about one of her choice. She asked me about the one about my love life and so I told her about how I had a bad dating experience recently and I hadn't had many before it so I was wondering if I was just bad at this. I joked about how I would have to wait another 19 years before meeting someone else (I was 19 at the time...I don't know what my logic was since it's not like I was of age to be dating for the entirety of those 19 years so even if I were correct about having to wait a long time, maybe it would be fewer years but that was besides the point).

I met my boyfriend later that day and we've been together for 3 years."
Agreed. It’s insulting to both the bride and groom!

I asked if something had spilled in their suitcase or if they needed to do laundry and they just said ""...no."" without further explanation. We live in a small apartment so it wasn't terrible just really weird. I'd walk to the kitchen to get something and they would just be sitting there staring at the wall with their things draped all around them. "
"Crossing little boundaries. I have a nickname that I like being called by people close to me, after I've established a banter or relationship with them. At first, I prefer my full name.

My mom has told me she wished she aborted me before. They refuse to admit wrong doing or apologize ever. So I packed my things one day, had a friend come pick me up, and left without saying goodbye.

In high school I had art class with a guy we will call “W”. W was always giving me a hard time even if I ignored him, and went out of my way to avoid him. One day, W decided to spend the class calling me an “orange slut”. I was trying to ignore him, but it got the point where I turned around and said “W, if you do not leave me alone, I will pour my paint water on you”. I turned back around and he muttered “cunt”. I stood up with my bucket of paint water and poured it on him, specifically on his crotch to make it look like he wet himself. He yelled, our art teacher shrugged and said “she warned you”. We had our next class together too and I told everyone he wet himself. Everyone laughed and forgot about it after 20 minutes.
In retrospect it was mean, but I spent the whole semester dealing with him harassing me, and it gave a huge feeling of relief to have fought back because I almost never stand up for myself.


TLDR: classmate was unnecessarily mean, I got fed up poured dirty paint water on his crotch and told people he wet himself.

I dumped him through text and blocked him on everything and went to work."

It's good to hear this every now and then. People think that being family obligates you in any way to accept shitty behaviour from other humans. No fucking way.
"Ugh. I feel you. Also fat. I remember boys coming up saying they liked me or generally throwing their friends under the bus by saying they liked me. The friend would, of course, recoil in horror. Then they'd see my reaction and go back and laugh with their friends right in my face.  They always made sure to do it in the cafeteria where it was most public. I cried many times at school over stuff like this. Then I got made fun of for being a baby and crying in front of the school.

When I found my SO, I still couldn't figure out if it was a joke and/or if he was using me. Scarred me, man.

EDIT: Years later someone posted a pic on Facebook and tagged me in it saying ""Look! It's you and ___."" I'm elbowing him in the picture. I remember the exact moment. He had his hands on me telling me how much he liked me while his friends laughed in the background. It's somewhere on the Internet now.

"I miss being able to agree to disagree with people’s political opinions.

A lot of people say they only voted for him because of his tax policy or because they didn’t like Clinton but they were evidently able to look past Trump’s blatant racism, ableism, sexism, and completely incompetent persona. Now, if I know someone who STILL supports Trump... I have to question their morals and critical thinking skills. 

I miss feeling anything but ashamed of my country. Our government is a joke, Trump is a joke, every day my husband and I say to each other “did you hear about [insert absurd, scary, horrifying, or disgusting Trump administration related news story here]?” And some days... we each have seen a news story the other one hasn’t. It’s exhausting.

"My sister in law, three different times. Once she showed up to my kid’s birthday party drunk and talking shit about her brother, my husband. We had done everything for her, let her live with us, use our car, helped pay for school and because we wouldn’t let her treat our kid like a toy, she decided to talk shit about him, at her nephew’s birthday party, in his own house. I cussed her up one side and down the other. 

Time two, she came to visit while I was on bedrest with our second kid. My 4 year old was going out of his mind with boredom so we tried to keep visitors coming through to amuse him because my husband traveled and I was allowed to sit/walk only 20 minutes a day, that included showering and eating. She was mad that I wasn’t comfortable having her boyfriend of two weeks sleep over and had told her he couldn’t spend the night. So she sat on my couch either wrapped around him like a snake or dry humping him while my 4 year old sat on my bed watching movies while I laid there essentially helpless until my husband came home and told her she wasn’t being helpful and she could go. 

Time three, above baby was born in scary emergency fashion, we almost lost her. Got out of the hospital and sister in law comes to visit, asks to use my sewing machine and my materials to make a new baby gift for her boss. Leaves the entire mess behind, fabric scraps, thread and supplies for my 5 day post partum, csection, brand new baby having self to clean up. Didn’t so much as handmade a card on a scrap of paper for her own niece or brother. But a whole blanket for her boss’s baby. 

She’s not welcome to visit anymore. "

Running. I hate that I like it. It feels like I have accomplished a little every time I hit a new mileage and gives me a new goal to make it more miles next time. I’m not fast but I’m doing better than everyone in their couch. It feels good and it’s good for me I can’t believe I like running. 
"Ugh, I went to a wedding where the couple had one of their cute little nephews walk down the aisle right before the bride...he was holding a sign that said ""Last chance to run."" WTF?!"
Years ago I was walking to my car and I guess my pants were more see through than I realized because a guy drives past me and shouts “Ha! Nice dimples!!” (Referring to my cellulite on the back of my thighs.) Ruined my day obviously but the most wtf thing about the incident was that he was fat himself!
"I did it at 23. First gyn wanted to send me to a shrink, and was a patronizing idiot. Second sent me to a social worker (which I was totally fine with), explicitly as a butt-covering measure. Interestingly, first was a woman, second was a man.

Surgery itself was fine. The fasting left me with hard to hit veins, and the first nurse was digging when starting the IV. Unfortunately for her, I had two NPs with me (mum and mum's friend, studying for an exam), and they stopped that nonsense pdq. Second nurse was amazing, no trouble at all.

Coming out of the general wasn't awesome, but not a big deal. I walked a few km later that day to get to my favourite restaurant, and the healing was nothing. 

I'm very happy I had it done, as it's made the whole thing a moot point, especially with potential partners. The ""you might change your mind"" argument is easy to shut down."

"I think constant self-deprecation can be an indicator too. I know it's something I do myself when I'm feeling insecure.

"When I was working at an ice cream place for a few months.

He was in his early/mid-20s, and I was 16.  He hit on me all the time, made really inappropriate comments, and was just a gross dude.  I would turn him down, and he would only schedule me for shifts he worked...the owner wouldn't ever do anything.  

But I was 16 and didn't have a good homelife and quitting meant spending more time at home, so I didn't consider it.

Then once I was in the back with him helping him restock some dry goods (we were closed) and I turned him down again and he raped me.

I went to the owner the next day and was fired.

I can't imagine working in a situation that bad again."

Best Man - Put together a video of just the groom (no reference to the bride at all) which included a five minute montage of the groom mooning the camera in thirty or so different settings. I barely know the groom, but I now have a more detailed knowledge of what his backside looks like than I actually wanted.  


FotB - Gave a long speech which primarily talked about the bride's sister and how awesome bride's-sister is and included a list of all the ways in which the bride had failed to be as awesome as her sister by way of a ""you had a rough start but we got you married off in the end"" speech. "

"My mother was ailing and it was the day before she passed away. I had lost my sister a few months before, and was caregiver to both through their illnesses without any close family for thousands of miles. 

One of my cousins sent me a huge delivery of frozen gourmet foods. This thing was amazing. I felt so loved and cared for. In the days and weeks that followed, I was able to defrost and cook as much as I needed. It brought a new meaning to the phrase “comfort food.”

Also, that particular cousin and her sister really stepped up for me and are now two of the closest people in my life, even though they live far away. We were never super close before, and now we talk a few times a week. "

"I would definitely not consider this a small change, albeit a good one!"
"Not super relevant, but one time when I was moving out of my apartment, I had rented one of those UHaul trucks and I had to stop at the gas sation to fill it up before returning it. Well some guy there thought the best was to hit on me would be to come over and go ""wow that truck's bigger than you!"" I turned around and went ""yeah well I would sure hope so."" The turned back to continue pumping my gas. He then says ""can you even drive that thing?!"" Really? No I just put on my genie outfit, sit criss-cross applesauce on the driver seat, fold my arms in front of my body, blink real hard and teleport myself and the truck to my next destination. I responded with ""well I drove it all the way here didn't I?"" He left me alone after that."

"It wasn't *technically* a guest. My boyfriend was in town and staying at my apartment and his best friend was also around (he was staying at mom's house). We had all gone out to the bar that night and around 11:30 I started getting a really bad headache so my boyfriend and I decided to go back to my place to sleep. His friend did NOT like that my boyfriend wouldn't be around anymore so he invited **the entire bar** back to my place. (My very drunk roommate had given this friend his key, not knowing exactly what was going on.)

So, my boyfriend and I were sleeping when around 12:45 I hear my front door open and someone shout ""PARTY TIME, FUCKERS"". I go out into the hallway to see people filing into my livingroom and this guy chugging a beer. Once I confronted him about not being okay with a party he proceeded to start screaming at me about how he never gets to see his friend now that we are dating, even though they lived in different states at the time. 

Luckily, the rest of the people were decent enough to start leaving once they knew that the owner of the place wasn't aware of the party they were invited to. "
I just feel like there's not much to tell when you have an easy pregnancy. That's why the bad things are more commonly talked about.
"I used to be a racist. 

I didn’t even know it. I was raised by the kind of people who SAID they weren’t racist, but used the words n—er, chink, raghead....the list goes on. If one thing from my childhood was inclusive, it was the list of epithets. And the “jokes.” It was always just a joke. 

I didn’t know until I was 19 years old that it was inappropriate to speak about farm laborers in the possessive. For example, “John Smith’s Mexicans,” was, and still is, a common way to refer to people back home. My friend Cruz was the one to point it out to me, and I will forever be grateful to him for his kindness in showing me how I was wrong. His gentle guidance opened my eyes to a lifetime of my family and community ingraining in me the finer points of casual racism. 

When I was in fifth grade, we had a mixed race family move to our town. One of their sons was in my grade and was literally my only friend that year. I called him a gook because I had no idea it was wrong. Aaron, wherever you are, I’m still so sorry for that. I’ll never forget the hurt in your eyes. 

My mother told me in no uncertain terms to lock my car doors in the city because of all the black people.

My dad would relay stories of lazy n—ers but make sure to specify that he meant that word because they were lazy; lazy white people could be n—ers too. Of course, we never actually called white people that. 

In high school, our Dean of Students relayed the story of how funny it was that someone from the state had called her to confirm that a public school in CA was really 98% white. Most of the Hispanic farm laborers sent their kids to the school 10 miles away, and nobody questioned it.

There were hundreds of those laborers, and who knows how many kids. I didn’t, because they were not a part of our community. They shopped elsewhere, socialized elsewhere, went to other churches, went to bigger schools. 

I grew up in California, not the South. Not the part of the country you expect racism in. 

It has taken years of conscious effort on my part, examining my actions and motivations over and over again in order to overcome what my upbringing made me. It has been painful to see that I was part of the problem, but self reflection often hurts. It has led me to change many things about how I view the world and now I’m trying my best to help others see these things in themselves. It’s often not productive. It’s often not appreciated. But things need to be said, and it’s only right that I try and mitigate the harm I’ve caused in any way I can. 

So speak up, white people. I know you’re tired of fighting; so am I. But we probably aren’t as tired of it as African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asians. And even if you’ve changed personally, you know people who haven’t. It’s YOUR job to fix it and we obviously still have a long way to go. Get back to work."

I think insults like that are terrible! I would still thoroughly approve of saying it to someone who would brazenly spit out some shit like that.

Wait wtf was his plan there? 
Might sound dumb but super quick naps. Read somewhere that taking short like 15-30 minute naps if you’re not feeling well or super tired makes you feel better than long ones and so far it’s worked for me phenomenally. I wake up feeling super alert and more refreshed than when I would get off work on a bad day and crash for two hours or so and wake up groggy. Plus I waste way less of my time on the days I need a nap now.

My boyfriend and i live together and his brother and sister in law came to visit us when i had my new baby. They brought their three year old son with them who proceeded to stick his fingers in my babies face and hit them while they were holding my baby. His sister in law didnt do anything to stop him. I almost cried in fear the little shit would hit my baby so my boyfriend told them to leave.

I’ll never get pregnant again because I know the second time around will not be anywhere as good an experience. There’s just no way!

"u/rivlet, listen to this person. Children and spouses that were excluded from wills - even intentionally - challenge those wills all the time and may succeed depending on the jurisdiction. If they haven’t yet, they should consult with an estate lawyer who can ensure their will is clear enough that there are no loopholes your brother can sink his claws into. One way people close said loopholes is by leaving a nominal sum and then including a provision that basically says “anyone who challenges their bequests in this will gets nothing and whatever was previously bequeathed to them shall be distributed to the other heirs”"

We weren’t friends for a bit but gradually started being friends again as we got older, and I did not see him as that same person as before, and we have been best friends for the last 3 years. We emotionally relied on each other and I trusted him (my mistake). He recently did the same thing as years ago—led me on, then realized he didn’t want a relationship. I finally realized I deserve better from both a friend and a potential partner, and said goodbye, as much as that hurts. I never would have imagined my best friend would use me like that again, after all of our history. Sucks. "

Saying the word “female(s)” instead of “women” or “ woman.” I have a few friends who do this and it confuses and concerns me.
"""The one"" isn't really a thing. There are probably lots of people out there that you could have successful long-term relationships with. 

Women put unrealistic expectations on their partners because of this idea. Men aren't mind readers, no one is perfect, and you are never going to be happy 100% of the time. Even if you are happily married, you are still going to be attracted to other people sometimes, and that's okay! 

If you are happy to see this person at the end of a bad day at work, if they treat you well and make you happy most of the time, if they treat you as an equal partner in your relationship, then they are a good partner and you can feel confident in your relationship... If you're constantly questioning your relationship with them and they don't treat you well or make you happy most of the time, they're not right for you and you can confidently move on to another relationship or whatever. 

But please, can we stop this absurd belief that there is one magical perfect person out there for each of us? That's really not how relationships work. 

I'm very happily married to a guy who totally isn't anything like the image I once held of ""the one."" "
"About 15 years. We met in high school, freshman year. We were best friends till we graduated. After we graduated we went our separate ways and then ran into each other 8 years later.

"Try to have a conversation with me at a bus stop/on public transport/when I’m walking down the street when we don’t know each other and you don’t have anything useful to tell me (like I dropped my wallet or something).

I have had exactly 0 interactions like this that were wanted on my part. Unless you’re in a social situation that’s specifically coded for meeting new people (at a bar or party, etc.), women usually don’t want to talk to men they don’t know. "
"Once a guy broke up with me because I didn’t orgasm when we had sex and he wasn’t able to enjoy sex because of that and tried to guilt trip me about it. Like, I still enjoyed sex and was pretty active in bed but I’m sorry not making me come hurt your masculinity somehow. "
"Weird one, but I love being hyper-feminine, past the point of normal. Give me my stupidly long fake eyelashes, neon glitter makeup, and bright pink dress that makes me look like an ice cream. 

Femininity is only seen as good when women are quiet, naturally pretty, submissive. Fuck that.. I LOVE dressing feminine and will take it to the fullest extreme, using it to be the loudest person in the room :)"

"As a male, if anyone changes a tire in front of me, I'll be impressed, regardless of the gender. "
"""hey you should....(change something about the way you look)"" no one gets a say into how you look. If they start criticing or 'offering advice' about what you wear or how you look then it is only so you fit their idea of what you should be for them. So many times misogynists want to keep you in a little box. If you wear a dress one day and jeans the next you can count on a comment about what they prefer and what you should do so that you always 'look your best' for them. 

Close second is whatever you hobby is you are not 'really' interested if you don't score 100% on their quizzing of random obscure facts about it, or high standards for what a real fan is. Oh you like hockey? - what year was it invented! You only jog 10km?!? See you don't really like it, but that's okay you are still cute. Misogynists can accept other guys liking something because they said they did, but for women the criteria is so much higher or else you just said it for some ulterior reason and must be lying. "
Nope. That crop top ain't gonna rock itself.

Insulting/judging other women
"Smashing cake into someone’s face. I know it’s a long standing tradition but it just feels rude and gross. Plus, people spend a lot of effort to get dressed up, hair, makeup. Cake can ruin it all so quickly."
"Skirts. Breezy and light during summer. I am sure they would like that too.

And sometimes I feel petty and would like to dress men in all that uncomfortable stuff that women are expected to wear. Like High Heels and bras and pants without real pockets and clothes that are a lot more form fitting or revealing. "
This happened to me too at swing dance class. He didn’t say anything but I could tell he was disgusted to be paired with me.
"My fiancé is the only man who has ever made me orgasm. I'm lucky in the sense that I *can* orgasm from penetration alone, but it's easier with clitoral stimulation. My fiancé was fairly inexperienced before he met me and never really watched porn, so he was more than willing to learn and didn't have any preconceived notions about what women like.

However, men I had been with previously had emotions ranging from indifference to poutiness to anger to feeling emasculated when I told them I didn't cum. Some of them acted like there was something wrong with me because their magical dick was unable to make me scream with pleasure. A lot of guys seem to think violently pounding on my vag is going to make me cum (no, it's just gonna hurt me) or else think 90 seconds of mediocre PIV should be sufficient. I think a lot of guys care about the female orgasm not because they care about our pleasure (if they did, they would have gotten it through their heads by now that penetration alone isn't sufficient for most women) but because they want to feel manly and like they achieved something."

"I don’t have any experience, personally, but my wife had a hysterectomy at 24. It was a long, tedious process. She had heavy periods that sent her to the ER every single month in excruciating pain. She had anemia that couldn’t be controlled. The OB that she went to had to go through a lot of hoops. She had a laparoscopy to check for endometriosis or adenomyosis (she didn’t have either). Her OB was stumped, but knew that a 24 year old should not be down for almost 2 weeks a month. She was started on Lupron Depot shots at the age of 23. She’s fairly active and the Lupron weakened her bones. Her OB wouldn’t let her stay on Lupron long term, but she wanted to make sure that not having a period would solve her problems. It did. After being on Lupron for several months, her doctor put in a request for her to have a hysterectomy with her insurance. Therapy was mandated. They wanted to know that she wouldn’t sue if she decided she wanted biological children. She’s adopted and so she told them that having biological children wasn’t a priority. Fortunately, around the time they would have pulled her off of Lupron, her biological mother died from breast and ovarian cancer. This was probably the main reason her insurance decided to cover a hysterectomy. She had genetic testing done to see if she was a carrier of BRCA1 or BRCA2. She wasn’t, so she got to keep her ovaries (her OB didn’t  want to send her into menopause at the age of 24). It’s been 9 years and her healthcare providers are still amazed that a 33 year old was sterilized at 24. Insurance was the biggest thing. Even with conditions that reduced her quality of life tremendously, her insurance didn’t think she was a good candidate for permanent sterilization. We praise her OB for taking her needs seriously because she truly was amazing, but her biological mother dying of cancer was most likely the reason her insurance relented.

Good luck in your pursuit of permanent sterilization. "

"Well I'm divorced so there's that... 😅
On a serious note though, it wasn't what I was expecting. The man I chose to marry completely changed after the ring was on.

I left shortly after "
We were out to lunch and he treated the waiter rudely.  It was completely humiliating to be with him in that moment.  I’m not with that guy anymore.  His assholishness started popping up in other ways and I was out of there.

"The first time my husband and I moved into a house with a dishwasher, I had no idea there was a different soap for them! I'd never used one! Loaded it, started it, went shopping. SO MANY BUBBLES!!!"
"About 10 years ago we had a birthday party for my husband.  I was newly pregnant at the time and had terrible morning sickness.  The party involved lots of drinking and was running super late, so I gave up and went to bed, telling everyone to either call a cab or crash at our place because I didn't want anyone drinking.

Several hours later I woke up to a naked man I had only just met 5 hours ago standing at the foot of my bed.  I sat up, obviously concerned, and he turned around and walked out of the room.  I decided to get up to find my husband, who hadn't made it to bed.  As I walked to the bedroom door I was assaulted by the worst smell I've ever encountered.  I flipped on the light and discovered a trail of liquid shit running up both ends of the hallway and into my room.  

After I vomited, I grabbed some old sheets and tossed them in layers on the floor and once again went off to find my husband.  There were people sleeping on all of my furniture along the way, and even one on the kitchen floor.  I woke up my husband and attempted to explain what was happening, but he was drunk and couldn't comprehend that there was a naked guy wandering our house leaving a trail of shit.  He tried to walk me back to bed and came upon the piled sheets on the floor.  As he bent to pick them up I yelled not to touch them, but he didn't listen...it took him entirely too long to connect my story, the mess he was looking at and the smell, but boy did his eyes get big when he did!  

We found naked guy outside the bathroom door with shit stains down his legs and up his back, the room he had crashed in and the bedroom were both covered. Hubby jabbed him with a foot a couple times and the guy got up and crawled into the bathroom slamming the door behind him.  No water ran as we stood there, but the guy came out dressed and stumbled to the living room, passed out against the couch and we couldn't get more than mumbles from him.  

Hubby sent me to bed and said he'd deal with it.  Bright and early the next morning husband and a couple of the other guys that stuck around woke the guy up long enough to tell him to hand over his wallet (which they touched with gloves) and took all his money which they used to buy garbage bags, bleach, lysol, rubber gloves and to rent a carpet shampooer.  

I left, having decided this was not my problem and they spent the day cleaning and disinfecting my entire house, naked dude sneaking out quietly unnoticed during the process.  

Everything got thrown away, all my linens, pillows, blankets, any fabric item he may have touched.  All solid items were coated in bleach and lysol, even the couch went to the dump.  

I never saw the guy again but my husband did one time and he was rightfully humiliated.  It was absolutely the most disgusting thing I have ever encountered, but we still joke about that one party he had that was the shit!"

"So I wouldn’t consider myself “unattractive” now but when I was in elementary school everybody called me Bags because I have hereditary dark circles. I started wearing makeup under my eyes at like 8 years old because I was so ashamed to be the school’s raccoon. My dad and grandma both have them and didn’t really see them on me. I asked every year for fancy eye creams that never worked and in high school I begged and pleaded for laser treatments and injections that supposedly helped. 

Also in high school I won homecoming queen and I had multiple people tell me I didn’t deserve it bc my acne made my face look like “bumpy dry wall.” I got on accutane like a month later and my face cleared up but now whenever I get a pimple I see the zit AND my dark circles and I have a breakdown and won’t leave my house.

I didn’t take care of my skin - got acne and resultant scarring. 

I ate poorly - lost weight. 

I didn’t look after my hair - hair became thin and fragile.

I didn’t go out and retreated myself to my bed - lost opportunities to meet new people.

But I got to take it one step at a time. I have to start treating myself well now. 

And what’s even worse is that my own best friend deserted me when I was going through a horrible ordeal. I have never felt so alone before."
"No details really, I was just looking out the bus window when this 30-something woman slipped on a banana peel on the sidewalk. She didn’t fall or anything, just sort of stumbled a little and then kept going her own way. "

Id be curious to know the coordinating weekly hours and general stress levels of all these jobs. I make just under $100k but my work stress is really low. I know a lot of people making over $100k and they work 10x harder for it and that’s not worth it to me.

"I agree with u/reenuhh. Personally, I don't date for fun- I date with a clear end goal in mind of searching for my future partner that I want to spend the rest of my life with. So if I knew they weren't the one (despite them being a super kind person) then I would break things off, especially since it wouldn't be fair to the other person. If it were me, I wouldn't want someone to stay with me if they knew I wasn't their ""one."" I would want them to stop wasting my time and to let me go so I could find my own person who was as serious about the relationship as I was."
"There was a post on a certain subreddit where a man's new wife had gone behind his back and paid their wedding photographer not to take any photos of her on their wedding day. He got the photos back, and there were lots of him and the guests, but none of the bride.

I've always had issues with body dysmorphia (having 
a good day until I saw my face in the mirror or a photograph; seeing myself as huge and galumphing even when I've always been underweight and under 5'; thinking I had awful skin until a makeup sales assistant complimented how 'clear' and 'perfect' it was), but I truly realised that something was more than a little off when I caught myself almost *wanting* to do what that bride had done if/when I got married to my long-term boyfriend, because the idea of being photographed at my own wedding terrified me."
"I've seen this done well, once. The wedding was being held a beautiful mountain resort. The couple went for a walk later in the evening, and he quietly proposed away from the crowd. They took 15 mins to themselves, and returned to the party. She didn't wear her ring, and they didn't say anything. They didn't mention it the next day at the post wedding events either. A couple days later after all the wedding hoopla had died down, and the bride and groom were away on their honeymoon, the now engaged couple posted a picture on their FB announcing the engagement.

I would have been ok with something like that at my wedding. But the getting down on one knee in the middle of the dance floor. OH FUCK NO. That's not cool. "

"That the harder they go, the better it is. Please stop punching my crotch."
"I’m so glad this question was asked and answered so well, as I am in a similar experience. I love my boyfriend dearly, we are compatible in many ways, and I’ve never been treated better. 

We discussed in the beginning that we agreed this may not be a “forever” relationship... And so far, I don’t see him as a “forever” partner, even though there’s no “good reason” for us the break up at all. In the meantime, I’m learning to allow myself to be vulnerable, transparent, kind, affectionate, and intimate with him because he deserves that and I also deserve to have the experience of loving. 

One day it may end, just as a season of life comes to an end in order to bring us a new experience for our growth.

"My husband and I used to have a friend who just.wouldn't.leave. He didn't do anything overly annoying and was pleasant but he somehow lacked the social instinct on when it was time to go. He would come over on a Friday night, drink, spend the night, wake up the next morning and sit on the couch waiting for us to entertain him. The longest he ever stayed was 3 days. Friday evening until Monday morning when he was forced to leave because we had to go to work. We eventually stopped inviting him over. "

Lunch is always a protein source (I’m vegan but you may not be so just ‘protein’ will cover both), brocolli, carrots, sweet potato and a kiwi 

Afternoon snack is always protein shake with peanut butter and a banana 

Dinner I stop eating carbs and have something like a huge salad or a stir fry or a healthy home made Chinese or chilli or something

I drink about 3 gallons of water a day, which is excessive I know but water is life yo. I also drink nothing but water after my morning coffee.

I stop eating at 5.30pm until 7.30am and only have a ‘treat’ at the weekends. Usually strawberries and peanut butter or cocoa powder and almond milk.

My first pregnancy was great. I only got mildly sick the first month or so. I’ve never felt more beautiful or feminine in my entire life. There were zero complications and I had an amazing support system. People would bend over backwards to make sure I was comfortable. I got to eat whatever I waned with zero guilt. It was awesome and then I got an amazing little girl at the end of it :)

"In high school I was trying to get my younger brother to go to one of those casual high school dances with me. Some girl I sort of knew from class comes up as I was talking to him and asks if he was my brother. When I said yes, she looks him up and down and says “oh... he’s super ugly” WHILE HE WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE. My lil bro already had self esteem issues and I could tell he was just totally crushed that some random  jerk would say something so horrid to a total stranger. 

Needless to say, he went home and did not come with me. I tracked the girl down at the dance and as she was somewhat overweight and I knew was self conscience about it I said something along the lines of “how would you feel if some random person came up to you and called you a fat cow? At least they would be telling the truth.”  And ended up making her ugly cry in front of everyone. Pretty mean, but I 100% do not regret it at all. Moral of this story is don’t say mean things if you can’t handle mean things being said back to you. "

He tried to play it off like he was just checking in. I asked if he thought I was stupid. He laughed, I said *bye* and hung up. "
"So I learned this from female friendship rather than a romantic relationship but I think it still applies. 
So I think of relationships like starting a campfire. 
There is Kindling, it catches immediately, burns hot and bright but doesn't last long. I used to have tons of these friendships and they always ended poorly. 
Then there are the logs, logs take a while to catch,  and require consistent work but once they get going they are reliable, stable, and provide all the warmth. 

To this day I literally tell myself ”logs not kindling” when I feel a new friendship progressing too fast "
"Almost every guy has been genuinely surprised when I told them I NEEDED clitoral stimulation every time in order to orgasm. 

Like no shit, most people can't orgasm while having their most sensitive part ignored. You wouldn't be able to orgasm from me just touching your balls and not your dick right? It ain't rocket science. "
"Despite how disgusting and stupid this idea is... it sounds kinda hilarious.

""Alright now Squirt!"" ""Aaaand... squirt!"" ""Come on... just squirt now"""

"I was jogging across an intersection, had the right of way, but a guy who was trying to make a turn as I was crossing shouted ""Run faster you fat bitch!""  Yelled it as I got to the other side of the intersection in front of all the other stopped traffic.  

Went on a date where the guy told me I was a ""6, maybe a 6 and a half. You're okay, but far from hot."" I guess I appreciated the honesty and we did not have a second date.  Still hopeful that there is one person out there that will think I'm hot one day!"
"There was, there's not anymore. I kept thinking if only the circumstances were right we'd finally make a go of it... Then the circumstances were right and he chose someone else. 

I really think from my experiences that if you both want to be together then you will make it work. If it's not happening then one of you doesn't really want it. "
"I dislike your husband, but only because he has set the bar so high."
"On here, any time someone asks ""What was your worst date?"", about sexual assault experiences, or ""How old were you the firsr time you got catcalled or hit on by a man?"" Those questions are very common and the answers are pretty much the same, always disturbing. I think sometimes when they're asking, they're just pretending to be ignorant and just want to get off on the responses. 

"
"As a young woman, older women think they have carte blanche to comment on my body and my choices. I had a coworker tell me I was being sexually harassed because my skirts were too short and in her opinion I deserved it for being provocative. 

I was so heartbroken that as the only two women in that workplace she would choose to tear me down instead  of guiding me and protecting me. Fuck those people. "
Yes SWEET JUSTICE! This one makes me happy. I’m so tired of people putting others’ lives in jeapardy because they get irritated while driving. F that! 
"*He also brought exactly 2 Pabst Blue Ribbons*

"&gt; ""Are you calling me a liar, young lady?

&gt; Honestly, who talks like that to a customer?

Liars, generally. 

Anyone I’ve ever heard use that phrase was a liar, a gaslighter, or at best had a poor grasp on reality that refused correction. "
"Family friends brought their kids over who threw sand from their pockets around the house, taped cat toys to the wall and taped our tv/wii, went through my underwear drawer, and dumped their leftovers from their plate onto the floor.

"Even beyond the First Lady being a voice and position of strength for women. 

There were quite a few women in Obama’s cabinet who held positions of power and were considered eloquent, intelligent women in their own regard. Now it just seems like the only women present are either tokens or just parrot and defend these incredibly terrible opinions because they feel like that is the only kind of power they can wield. 

It’s so very disheartening and backward-facing that we are given women “in power” that can only say so much. As much as I don’t want to sound reactionary or inflammatory, it seems more and more that we’re headed toward a Handmaid’s Tale sort of future. 

It’s honestly terrifying. "
Doggy. Especially since we have a big mirror in our bedroom.
"Rock climbing. I'm afraid of heights lol. However, climbing up is really fun. It's a great workout that helps teach you how to think on your feet. Plus, now when I run through my escape scenarios where there's an active shooter or the FBI is hunting me down, I can be reasonably confident that I can actually climb up walls to help escape."
"I admit I don’t have a major love for veggies. I just try to eat large quantities of the ones I do like. I eat a ton of salads, baby carrots (raw), grape tomatoes, strawberries, etc.

Soups are also a good way to stash veggies in a delicious and, frequently, lower-calorie dish."

"Living some kind of ""free spirited"" or ""alternative"" life style. 

I actually like having a corporate job, making good money and having a routine. 

The scattered nature of more ""alternative"" lifestyles was exhausting to me. I felt like I was *trying* to have fun a lot of the time but wasn't succeeding. Pretty much the same reason I much prefer being an adult with a job to being a student. "
"It's all good!  I'm a lawyer as well and I warned them about that immediately so they put in the line about him getting his comic books and that is it.

Also adding: no ethical concerns about taking under the will either since I did not draw up their wills.  They saw a separate lawyer for that and then just had me read the final, official version."
"My husband and I were high school sweethearts. Started dating when I was 14 and he was 17...got married when I was 18 and he was 21...we’ll celebrate 32 years together this coming November. Our kids are grown now and we actually connect better now than ever. I think it’s because we’re older and realize how precious life is so we try not to take each other for granted. We talk about everything. If either of us has a problem or disagrees with the other, we make it a point to communicate rather than lose our tempers/jump to conclusions. I came from a really f**ked up childhood and my husband has been the most patient, loving man...I got very lucky! 🍀❤️"
"&gt; And if you're even asking, chances are I haven't. You'd know. 

This. If I cum during sex there isn't going to be any question about it other than ""can you please unwrap your thighs from my hips, I cannot move in this vise grip""

XD"
"I had this happen to me.  He was trying to get me off, but it was painful.  I told him to stop and he didn’t listen, so I pushed him off of me.  He got offended and called me a bitch.  I told him he would be a bitch too if I used my teeth to scrape his dick, because that’s what it felt like he was doing to me.  He apologized and said he was lost in the moment.  "
Especially since on average men BENEFIT in terms of longevity and mental health from marriage.
"Just yesterday I was with a guy I was casually seeing. We were talking about sushi, and specifically the ginger that's served with it. 

""It's to cleanse your palate between different rolls,"" I said. 

""No, it's to settle your stomach after you're done eating,"" he said. 

I looked it up online and read him a sentence that said almost verbatim what I'd just told him. He still didn't believe me. "
"I'm sure it's an unfair reaction but my whole body shudders when a man calls a woman ""a female"". "
"One of my relatives put a little tasteful chalkboard sign up asking people to put their phones away for the ceremony...one of the funniest photos she got back was of her mother and MIL crouched awkwardly trying to phone-photograph the ring exchange, sign fully in focus between them. The photogs got the shot from other angles but I think they included that one just for laughs."
"I'm a guy but I totally second this. Weirdly enough, my inspiration to start putting an effort into my look actually started with Queer Eye. Before that, I'd assumed that dressing well, for men at least, was something only gay guys did (I am gay but I made an effort not to show it), but I definitely feel a lot better about myself now that I've actually started trying."
"I keep waiting for someone to write about the money they make with their MLM...

"He told me that I wasn't allowed to have a car in case I was hanging out with someone without him there to supervise it.

I had to walk 3 miles to work at my full time job because he wouldn't give me my keys."
"Yes! And some men just like it, too. My younger brother doesn't personally use makeup, but there were many times in high school when he would ask me to help cover up a break out. I asked him if he wanted me to take him to the store to get some concealer, (he's tan, and I'm as pale as a sheet of paper), and if he'd like me to teach him to use it, but he said no.

There have been times, though, when we've just been hanging out, and he's asked if he could play around and do my makeup, or if I could do his. I did a natural look for him once, and I could tell he *loved* it. He had me take pictures and he couldn't stop smiling. It was so cute haha. He also wears makeup, usually eyeliner, whenever he wears costumes (for parties or Halloween), and he's comfortable with it. He doesn't go out in makeup, but I can tell that he does like it, at least a little.

Actually, a few months ago, my family hosted a international food party, where couples picked a country, made a food from the country, and presented it, with information about the culture and the food, for everyone to try. You could dress up as well, if you wanted, and my brother and I paired up to do it. We got Norway, so we decided to dress like our Norwegian Viking ancestors. We wore fur coats, and I did warrior type makeup (as best I could). I put some eyeliner on him, in a lightning strike kind of style, and he *loved* it. He said he wanted to go to bars like that haha. One of the guys at the party though said he looked gay, in a kind of condescending way, and that he'd fit right in at a gay bar. My brother just shrugged his shoulders and said, ""I'm sure they'd love me. I look great!"".

Anyway, now that this has gotten very very long, I agree with you, obviously :P I wish more men felt comfortable with putting on makeup. It doesn't make you gay. It just enhances everything, and can make you feel better, inside and out."
"I went through a phase in middle school where I literally would not wear a shirt unless it had some ""hilarious"" graphic on it. I was 12, so they were usually stupid shings like, ""I'd rather be playing video games"" or ""Homework? No thanks"" Idk, just stupid shit. It's taken me almost ten years to be able to wear any graphic shirt since, just because they always remind me of that cringe time in my life, haha.

But skinny jeans are here to stay, I will never go back to the jeans of the 2000's that were so baggy they covered my whole foot if I wasn't wearing shoes. Skinny jeans are amazing, comfortable, and make your ass shine like a diamond."
"I don't think I'm unattractive now, but I guess I was ""awkward"" as a preteen.  One day I was just walking through the cafeteria to get lunch and this boy (who I actually thought was kind of cute) made a point of stopping me in my path, and just shouted ""you're ugly"" at me.  It still sticks in my mind 17 years later.  I don't think I'll ever forget."
"I stopped drinking for 2 months and it changed how I coped with things, it was one of the best things I’ve done for myself."

"I was friends with my husbands group of friends in high school but somehow had never met him. When we were 25, we were at the same club an hour from home, got to chatting and realized we were practically neighbors and I knew all of his friends. We've been hitched for 18 years now."
"I had this issue with my ex, he once said to me ""if I start staring at your friend just slap me."" naturally I didn't but thought in my head ""Yeah way to make your girlfriend feel jealous and insecure around her best friend you ass."" We broke up a few months after that."
I always figured that it was a mental health thing
"To add to this, you don't have to create a whole routine for yourself. Sometimes when just getting in the shower seems like a marathon, it's not feasible to carry all this out. 
For me, it's a single item that helps. Keeping in mind that I'm probably a 4/10 on the attractiveness scale for women (objectively speaking), anything that makes me feel even the slightest bit more comfortable with myself helps. I finally found a lotion that I love the smell of and doesn't irritate my skin. Spent $45 on a single bottle... But every time I shower, I slather myself in the lotion. For some reason, it makes me feel a little bit more put together, a little bit more composed. It sounds terribly stupid, but sometimes that lotion is what gets me through the day. "
"I was dating a guy who was driving me to his parent’s house. I was sitting there looking, noticing he was going to switch lanes, but he didn’t signal or look over his shoulder. He just started to go. I told him stop because there was a dude right next to us that he almost hit. It was my boyfriend’s fault. Period. He wasn’t looking and almost hit this guy. The good news he reacted quick enough and we were all fine. The other guy wasn’t happy and honked his horn at us before driving off. Totally warranted in my opinion. So what did my boyfriend do? He flipped out. He literally grabbed his knife out his pocket, and pointed it at the car next to me and started screaming at that guy as he was driving off. The knife was literally in my face because the car he almost cut off was on my side. It was literally the scariest thing for so many reasons. The other dude could have seen his knife and pulled over. Then maybe a gun fight could have ensued. My boyfriend’s anger was so out of control. I had known him since elementary school. At that point in time we were 25?? I think. Anyway, we knew each other for that long and I had never seen him react like that. It was so scary. I told his parents what happened and they were supposedly worried Bc he’s been starting these random anger outbursts for no reason as of late and no one knew why. I had to end the relationship and unfortunately our long term friendship went with it. Moral of the story, dudes need to chill TF out. It’s definitely scary to be around that. "
"Someone who was a family friend stayed with us for ~2 years when I was a kid, around the time of the 2008 recession. Turned out he had been molesting my older sister for a good part of the time. Worst house guest ever. I hope he's still rotting in jail. Fuck you (name), we trusted you."

"He not only listens to Chris Brown but either actively defends him or doesn't care about what he's done. Or he shits on Rihanna in retaliation when you bring up what CB has done. 

On that note, if he hates all female singers/can't think of any female singers or film stars he actually likes beyond their looks. 

He interrupts you all the time.

He laughs when you show anger. 

Whatever you say/tell him, he never really responds to you, he responds about *him*. 

He judges or gets enraged at female characters who mess things up/aren't perfect on TV shows and doesn't really acknowledge they're *fictional* and that the issue is likely poor or inconsiderate writing. He seems to revel in calling the character slurs and wishing bad things on her. 

Obviously if he arcs up about any gender issue the media brings/stirs up and never considers the female side of things.  

Says ""females"" instead of ""women"" (sometime an indication, not always)

Thinks wage gap is a myth.

I've gotten to know over the years a LOT of men see pretty women as a prize or gift for them from the universe. Sounds ridiculous but it's true. They think meeting a pretty girl is a big moment for them and that she will be his (and the insecure ones assume she's already another man's trophy). It's hard to explain this, it comes from years of being looked at this way/treated as non-human but in a seemingly positive sense. But he is not thinking about the woman at all, only himself and what she means for him. It might not be viciously misogynistic but it still plays heavily into the idea that women exist *for* men. "
To be fair I don't think most of my guy friends can change a tire (tyre?). I had to do it once a couple of years ago and it was a big deal. I was super proud of my guy self and told everybody. 
"*Downplayed any stress or frustration I had-especially about work.* 

*Literally, \*literally\*, swore I was the luckiest woman in the world because I got to have sex with him.*

*Refused to clean and organize his room because those were ""women things.""*

*Would leave his dishes in the sink for days until I was there to wash them. He was ""bad at it.""*

None of these are subtle, now that I reflect on my relationship with him. But during that time I  was great at making excuses for him. "
"Okay so you have to understand that a lot of the guys who wear this come from environments such as ghettos in which people tend to be poor, all while being surrounded by a culture that values wealth and material commodities as a way to prove yourself. Clothes in particular are a clear way to signal to people how much money you have or how wealthy you are. So, leaving the stickers on your hat became a way to show off that your hat is new or recently bought (aka you can spend money on hats). It’s just another way to show off and “flex” on people. 

I think it’s evolved into a fashion trend of its own but at least that was the original idea. I personally still think they look tacky "
"Pretty much everything. Politics is literally what I do for a living and I miss not having to deal with this insane level of sheer incompetence, stupidity, and maliciousness on a daily basis. I miss feeling safe in my own country. I miss feeling like we had a leader who wanted to do the best with what he had and didn't think that people were less than him because of their skin color, nationality, gender, or religion.

I do what I do because I love it and bad people being in office means we're all needed more than ever...but it's hard sometimes when you see the vile things coming out of this administration."
"Ditto.  I own our house and have more experience in home stuff.  Contractors constantly try to redirect to my boyfriend and he's like ""Hey not my house""."
"Then they shouldn't get married.  And I think the guys who say ""I don't want to get married because then they'll steal all my goods, them gold-diggers"" REALLY shouldn't ever get married.  In fact, I'd recommend they avoid relationships all together, for the good of all.  

I've been married, for 19 years, and then divorced.  I'm in no hurry to get married again, though I'd like to be in a long-term committed relationship again. I see the point of marriage as an institution -- it makes things easier, legally.  It makes it simpler to pool resources for common goals, and to specialize in a way that often really does allow a couple as a unit to be more successful.  

I'm glad that divorce is available and no-fault, so that few are trapped in marriages that don't suit them.  (That would be awful.)  And yes, I think it's fair for assets to be split in a divorce, because both parties have contributed to the relationship, financially, emotionally, logistically, whatever.  

The things that scare me about marriage are the things that went wrong in my own marriage.  I worry about emotional abuse.  That he'll turn into someone who judges me all the time, telling me how awful and lazy I am, how I need to change everything about myself, because that feels (to him) like he's got the moral high ground.  But that has nothing to do with *marriage*, I suppose, and everything to do with living together, being in each other's pocket."

"I own my home and my boyfriend lives with me. There are things which ONLY the homeowner can make decisions on, or ONLY the homeowner can sign. Guess who everyone wants to talk to though? Not me. I have to go out of my way to establish communication and make it clear that I'm the one to talk to, and I assume that most of the men think I'm a bossy b word but that's okay. 

Also, mechanics/auto repair stores want to talk to my boyfriend about my car. Which I own and pay for. Also my boyfriend knows nothing about cars. 

I also notice that waiters/waitresses/cashiers will hand my debit card, which I handed to them, back to my boyfriend. I have noticed this through several boyfriends over several years. Or I will hand them cash and they try to give my boyfriend the change, which is super awkward because he is never paying attention and doesn't want the change, so then I'm like reaching over him to get my money or having to take it back from him if he does take it."
"My female friend uses this as a test. She says she ""works in the hospital"" to people that ask. Some assume she's a secretary or nurse. She's a quite senior medic."

"The contractor thing drives me crazy! My husband and I were in Madrid and I asked a police officer for directions in Spanish. The police officer turned to my husband, which meant his back was now to me, and began to give my husband directions in Spanish. My husband doesn't speak Spanish beyond the two years he took in high school whereas I studied it at university. I was trying to crane my head around the officer to hear what he was saying without much luck while my husband was trying to pick out the few words he knew. It was so frustrating.

"Most questions, if I'm honest.  

Anything asking about orgasms or specific body parts, like feet or vaginas.  They're mostly fap material.

Anything asking about traumatic events like rape or abuse.  Those questions are *usually* posted in good faith, but sometimes OP gives off a vibe.

Anything slightly touching on ""men's"" issues, like height or suicide or child support/divorce.  Usually guys who want to argue.

A lot of questions about products we use or buy, especially subscription boxes and beauty products.  

Anything along the lines of ""Would you date a guy who _________?""

"I heard someone crying outside one day, really loudly, in the middle of the night. I looked out the window and saw it was a woman beneath a street lamp. I decided to run downstairs and see if she was okay. She was very beautiful and elegant and utterly distraught. She grabbed my hands very tightly and looked straight into my eyes and said ""promise me you'll never be in a relationship with a younger man. It is DISASTEROUS"". She made me promise.

I'm now dating a guy 6 years younger, and I'm scared I'm going to turn into her. "
"I have thought about doing the same when my bio dad dies. With the way her chugs alcohol everyday, it could happen anytime too. "
I feel like every time I’ve ever seen a question along the lines of “how has feminism affected your life?” It’s like an anti-feminist guy looking for women to say feminism has made them sad or allowed us to divorce men and take their money or something. 
"-- All his exes are ""crazy""

-- Every problem you mention that women suffer from, he has to BUT WHAT ABOUT MEN you

-- Interrupts women and not men

-- Needs to demonstrate he knows more than you on a typically 'male' interest of yours that you may be an expert or even a professional in

-- Virtue signals by calling someone out but then does the exact same thing when not thinking about it

-- Is a jerk to their mom, your mom, or female waitresses/bartenders"
"No, I don’t regret it, but there are times they completely wear me out.  
  
I don’t *not* regret it because I’m a perfect mom or something, I just don’t really tend to regret things. It’s pointless to regret something you can’t change, kids or otherwise. Do I ever feel overwhelmed? Yep. Lonely? Sometimes. Like a bad mom? Yeah. 
  
At the end of the day, I’m usually pretty tired. I’ve answered 5 million questions, had my boobs sucked dry, desperately seeking peace and quiet...But I still miss my kids once they’re in bed.  
   
I think a lot of people get hung up on what you can’t do when you have kids. If it’s a huge hang up, it’s not time to have kids (if you choose to have them at all, that is). But it’s not like your life just becomes a cheerio-encrusted hot mess once you have kids. You don’t *have* to lose your identity, your career, your hobbies. You priorities change, yes, but the essence of who you are is still there. Depending on your perspective, you can see your children as an addition to that, or a deficit from it.

As for some specifics-find healthier snacks. I love hummus with any veggies but especially bell peppers. I also do a little coconut milk yogurt and granola when I'm craving ice cream as a snack.

I'm also a big fan of smoothies for breakfast-a little bit of fruit, a ton of veggies, a scoup of Vega vanilla protein powder, and almond milk."
