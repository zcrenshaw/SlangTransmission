They say finding a lesbian partner is like finding a job: either someone refers you or you have to look online.
"There were many but I'd say the biggest ones were:

\-the only woman he loved was his mother (to the point where he tried to dress me like her)

\-his collection of porn was VERY specific

\-he lost his mind when I got a raise and made more money than him; his next response to this being that I now had to buy him everything

\-he refused to let me hang out with my lady friends because they'd poison my mind and he refused to let me hang out with my dude friends because they'd try to fuck me aka I can't hang out with anyone"
"There was a study done a few years ago where men were surveyed. Apparently men want an attractive and ""sweet"" wife, but they want strong intelligent daughters.

"This really high up VP at our company just.....disappeared. He didn’t quit, he wasn’t fired, but it’s been 4 months and no one has seen or heard from him. He just vanished into thin air, dropped completely off of social media, no one knows if he’s dead or alive. 

The kicker is HR found out he’d been charging personal trips to his company card and he owes the company $28k+. So they’ve launched an investigation and are trying to find him. We’re all following with bated breath. "
"It's so hard to find women to date. Every time I flirt with a girl I'm thinking, ""OK, but is she actually into me or is she just a straight girl being nice?""

Even when I bite the bullet and ask her out I feel like I have to be ridiculously clear that I mean it romantically, as in I want to be in lesbians with her, else she might take it as just two gal pals having lunch."
"He sits up, opens his eyes and talks in his sleep. It's mostly just him whispering ""hey"" but sometimes he'll hit me with something creepy, like ""They're here"" or ""Don't look""

Doesn't help that I think our house is haunted lol 


"
"My friend, the bride, asked me to be her maid of honour.  She had asked her other friend to be her matron of honour.  I was expected to do everything because the matron was pregnant (maybe 4 months along or so).  I was young and stupid so I went along with this. 
Was tasked with planning the shower and asked for a list of people that should be invited. Invited them all and hardly anyone came. Bought all the food and decorations while the matron sat around and did nothing to help.  She didn’t offer a dime or any help.

Later I was told that I didn’t do that great of a job because certain people weren’t there.  They weren’t on the invite list.

The day of the wedding the bride is off getting hair and makeup done with the matron at a fancy salon and I had a friend of the bride come to the hotel room to do mine.  The bride said the difference was because the matron had done so much for her.

We aren’t friends anymore."
"It's not so much something he does because he doesn't really have control over it, but it's scary nonetheless. 

I crawled into bed with him the other night, and I couldn't tell if he was breathing. I put my hand on his back and couldn't feel a thing. I panicked so bad. I thought he was dead. When he woke up he said he was having the ""best night's sleep ever.""  Guess who has an appointment to get checked for sleep apnea now? Yep, he does."
"I work at a daycare. Our current director is in some hot water after being accused of sleeping with several of the married employees. We have one man on the entire staff and it’s our director.... he’s also refusing to step down.

After this came out some parents have said the same thing. I don’t how many married women he’s slept with but it easily over 9. That’s just married women! 

I know he’s slept with more women because I’ve slept with him. "
"You’re only hearing the bad ones. 

Look, I’ve had extremely disappointing, boring sex with selfish and uninvolved male lovers; sessions that are basically what you describe. I’ve also had incredible, intimate, passionate, absolutely erotic and pleasurable and mind-blowing sex with caring, considerate and talented male lovers. 

The risk of shitty sex is indeed ever present. But there are lots of absolutely amazing male lovers out there. I think most men fall into the more considerate and giving category, rather than the selfish category. "
"Gods, yes. I see mothers and female teachers doing it constantly. They’ll laugh off a little boy’s violent outbursts and tell them not to cry when they’re genuinely distressed. Meanwhile the girls are scolded for violence and hugged when sad. 

Not to mention the weird things people say about baby boys. No, that little boy isn’t a “flirt,” he’s a fucking baby. "
"Oooh this is a knockout question, but I think it’d be more illuminating to ask the dudes. 

"
"My sister doesn’t let my nephew cry. If he’s upset, even rightfully so, she’ll ask him, “Are you a little girl?” Meanwhile, my niece will cry over anything and everything. She has no respect for any of my nephew’s things (taking them from him or straight up breaking them on purpose) and that’s okay, but heaven forbid he wants to play with one of her toys nicely. 

Edit: Yes, I’ve said something. No, it doesn’t do any good. "
"For me personally: when he was having sex with me in stead of the two of us having sex with each other.


He was starting to use me as a sex doll and more or less jerking off inside me. He stopped when he finished and didn't stop when I said he was hurting me. Later found out he did this to a handfull of other girls... at the same time. Left me broken and confused."
"- His dad's girlfriend would only visit on the weekends and did all of the laundry/ironing/cleaning whilst she was there, then they'd go have sex, then he'd take her shopping. He adored his dad. I should have realised sooner that would fuck with his view of equality. 

- He would take me aside in public settings and ""remind me"" that girls just aren't funny and I was embarrassing us both by trying. 

- I was working as a barista and decided I wanted a grown up job so was applying to a call centre for a bank. He sat me down and explained that he didn't think it was a good idea because he didn't want me to be upset when I didn't get the job (obviously, I did get the job). 

I could list a million things he did/said that made him a major arsehole, but these are the ones I can think of that specifically apply to being a misogynist. 

Edit: he was not having sex with his dads girlfriend. That’s a description of the relationship his dad and dads girlfriend had. Then because my (ex)boyfriend adored his dad, he thought that was how relationships should be."
"I work remotely so on a local level, my fatass cat is up in arms about her new diet and makes sure to tell me about it.

On a more regional level, one of our other remote consultants was fired recently. We know we're not supposed to ask why and management isn't allowed to tell us...but firings are super rare in our department and you have to mess up really, really bad. Our imaginations are going wild."
"We went to high school with Stanford rapist Brock Turner. Although I was in my first year of college when all that went down, news traveled around my small hometown very quickly. A bunch of people, including my parents and all my friends, were shocked and disgusted. My high school even took down all the swimming records Brock set while he was in high school (and it was quite a few records; now there are just blank spaces on the record board). Shortly after the news broke, my ex's mom brought it up in conversation with the two of us. I was horrified when my ex responded, ""What happened to innocent until proven guilty? What if the victim is lying? There's no proof."" 

Like dude, two people caught him sexually assaulting this girl and she actually had pine needles INSIDE OF HER at the hospital. Have some compassion. The icing on this shit cake was that I'd been sexually assaulted a year prior and he KNEW this yet he chose to defend a rapist in front of me. This was definitely when I felt the relationship start to die. 

Edit: same guy also told me that I earned all my scholarships to college because of my gender :( We were in the same mechanical engineering major at college and I think he was just jealous that I was graduating a year early and he wasn't, but that's still a super shitty and demoralizing thing to say to a young woman going into a difficult, male-dominated field. For the record, I've earned about $80k in scholarships throughout undergrad, and $750 of my scholarships has been for women only, which comes out to less than 1%. "
"Funny. My dad supported me like whoa when I lived at home. Bought me books like the “51% Minority”, took me college shopping all over the east coast. Made sure I knew how to be self sufficient growing up. 

Now I’m married and almost 30. He voted for Trump, can’t understand “where I went wrong” with my political values and is wondering why I won’t change my last name to my husbands. 

Also, divorced my mom as soon as she started making as much as him (after getting s masters in Education while he never completed his technical degree and became a trucker).

So I’m with you. What changed in the past ten years?"
"\-Just seemed to always be angered by ""feminazis"" and was always showing me videos about why modern day feminists were crazy/gross/weird etc.

\-Had converted to Islam, tried to explain to me that women not being allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia was a good thing because it protected them from danger (not because men consider them to be property and don't want to risk them running away. NEVERRRR that.)

\-After seeing my ex's brother at a stop light and having a very brief ""hey how ya doin"" kind of conversation, he became incredibly angry and expressed that we would eventually need to move to a different state because of my ""reputation.""

\-Was always expressing how much it bothered him that I was so sexually experienced, and that he hated how many partners I had. Would literally just go on-and-on about this, as if I could change it.

\-Constantly expressed how much it upset him that I was stuck supporting us financially. He did not attempt to get a job. Well, he got one at Wendy's for 2-weeks but got fired after he stopped showing up because he self-diagnosed himself with pneumonia.

\-Thought all of my friends were whores and bad influences.

\-We ended up breaking up because after he *ordered* me to throw away a paper plate, I said no, and decided to do laundry instead. My defiance infuriated him, and led to him screaming at the top of his lungs inches from my face, ""NO WONDER YOU GOT MOLESTED WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE, YOU'RE A FUCKING CUNT!"" "
"""Are these your underwear or mine?"""
"One of our farmhands is having an illicit love affair with one of our milkers, and they fully think we don't know about it. They're both married to women and keep disappearing in the barn together and we've also noticed our dipping agent stocks being very low lately. 

Also, the wife of our neighbouring farmer has been screwing the local guard (police officer) and the entire community is absolutely scandalised and up in arms about it."
"Alright, here goes: Female Officer (mother of 1, not married) hooks up with a male officer (no kids, not married). She’s cheating on him with a sergeant (child status unknown, married) who’s wife is also a sergeant where all 4 of them work. 
 
 The male officer finds out she’s cheating on him, so he dumps her. She goes to the male sergeant and says “Leave your wife and it’ll just be me and you.” 

 He says “My wife found out about us but she’s willing to take me back as long as I agree to go to marriage counseling. So, you and I are done.”

  Now she’s pregnant but doesn’t know by who (or so she says.)"
"I had always been a hugger. One day someone I had just met came up and gave me a hug, and for some reason it made me extraordinarily uncomfortable. It was very out of the norm for me, but a good wake up call. Outside of close friends and family, I now ask before making any kind of physical contact with anyone. "
"Asking for permission seems archaic and sexist to me but asking for a parent's blessing is fine, in my book. My husband spoke to my dad before he proposed to me but more in a ""I love your daughter and I want to include you in our lives because you're important to her and therefore me""-way, rather than ""please let me have her"". "
They want confirmation and justification for their beliefs
"I work in a Lush spa. So we have the idea that straight men don’t have treatments as well as straight men don’t buy cosmetics and bath bombs (even though 1 of the founders are male, both his sons work for the company, the head of the in-house band is male...) 

At least twice a day I have a customer or potential customer make a comment about how their husband/brother/dad/friend/boyfriend would never have a treatment because that’s not the normal thing for men. And even though I want to scream THE SOAP HAS NO FUCKING GENDER I smile and try to break down the issues surrounding this idea. About 50% of the time they realise that maybe this is something they might enjoy, the rest are lost causes. 

I love doing spa tours for this reason and showing guys around the spa because it’s like Willy Wonkas factory... starlights on the ceiling, sea mist rolling across the floor, rose scented bubbles floating through the air. With two treatments you can put rum in your tea! What’s not to love? "
"My sister was the bride. Because I was noticeable thinner than the other bridesmaid (I was maybe a UK size 6, the other bridesmaid was a 16) my dress was padded, and had several extra layers in the skirt. I looked absurd, in a massive dress with my skinny arms and neck poking out, plus I almost sweated to death, and the extra layers of tulle in the skirt became a massive fly trap. "
"Culturally (in every culture I've studied - others feel free to comment cultures that are different), male is seen as the ""default"" for people.  That permeates life in pretty much every way, including online.  I mean, if I started a story with ""I saw this person walking down the street,"" what most people would picture is a man unless I clarified with ""and she was..."""
"Oh god, so fucking many.  

- On multiple occasions, totally unprovoked, he called his own little sister a cunt for a number of trivial reasons (her dog needs anxiety medication, she dates guys he doesn't approve of, she went to the ""wrong"" college)  
- He once got very offended that his best friend's girlfriend had the nerve to get visibly annoyed with her boyfriend, because his friend had cosigned her student loans for nursing school -- which, I guess, means she's not allowed to get annoyed with him ever  
- He went on a number of rants about how hiring women is a huge disadvantage because they always eventually get pregnant  
- When one of his coworkers was fired for getting wasted and making lewd/inappropriate comments to a subordinate female employee, his response was to flip the fuck out about how ridiculous it was that his company wouldn't tell them who had reported it, but it didn't matter anyways because he bet he knew who it was and ""she's always been a fucking bitch""  
- Any time any of his friends started to have less time for him on account of starting/being in a relationship, he would blame the woman for monopolizing his friends' time and start concern trolling about whether they were being manipulated  
- He insinuated that all women who make sexual harassment complaints at work are liars looking to benefit from damaging the reputations of good, hard-working men like his father, who has been accused of harassment at least 3 separate times but DEFINITELY didn't do it because ""these women weren't even attractive""

He was the sorriest piece of shit I've ever had the misfortune of dating. That's not even close to all of it, either."
"I have a hard time talking to women I'm interested in because I'm afraid of making them uncomfortable in ways that unwanted advances from men make me feel.

Edit: also unicorn hunters have made it really hard for me to date girls because they assume I'm going to spring my male partner on them once I lull them into a false sense of security. I know what that feels like and that's the last thing I want."
"That you can hold it, like how people do with pee. "
"Mother Theresa and Coco Chanel. I heard only good things about the first, only the  quotes and success of the other. Then I read about them and apparently they were both awful."
"&gt; He would take me aside in public settings and ""remind me"" that girls just aren't funny and I was embarrassing us both by trying.

Instant breakup in my book."
"I totally notice this with my dad. I think it’s because I’m “his kid” so if I correct him or succeed at something better than him, he can kinda attribute it to himself, which just adds to his ego. However if my mom does this or another female.. it’s a different story "
"Oh I forgot about a second one.  I didn't seriously date this guy, we were just friends but he wanted more.  However, tons of red flags:

* He was 28 and I was 18.  When I told him I was too young for him he told me I wasn't the youngest he had been with.
* He lived with his mother, but referred to it as ""her living with him.""  idk if this was a misogynist sign, but it was a sign that he was fucking weird because I get that it's a bit embarrassing to still be living with your parents, but just own up to it!  I saw ""his"" house and it was clearly the house of a 60 year old Italian lady.
* He wouldn't listen to me when I told him he crossed boundaries.  He just completely disregarded me being super explicit and saying stuff like ""Please stop texting me about anything romantic or sexual, I am not interested.""
* Specific words used were ""I know women, and you may not always know what you want, but I do.""  eeek.
* Went on and on about how much he respected women because he loved his mother, but his idea of respecting women meant making choices for them (ie: not leaving me alone because ""trust me, you don't realize it now but you want me"""
"For sure. I've been guilty of it myself. I remember one instance, when I told a close guy friend of mine that men crying makes me uncomfortable, and later, he was going through a hard time with his girlfriend, came over, cried and apologized for crying. I was like ""dammit, Hatcheling, why would you say something like that?"". I tried assuring him that him crying was absolutely fine, and proceeded to comfort him and advice him, but that moment definitely made me realize that I need to think about what I say more. "
My permission is the only permission needed. Anyone who thought they could ask anyone else isn’t the person I want to be with.
"I feel like a unicorn sometimes, in that the weddings I've been in (or adjacent to) have all had brides who were the same wonderful easygoing people (if more stressed) that I was friends with to begin with. No complaints whatsoever.

One thing I learned from my own wedding, though, is that there can be such a thing as ""too chill"" to the point that it becomes unhelpful.  We strongly didn't want our small wedding party to have to buy new matching clothes, so we told my sister/MoH and sister-in-law/groomswoman to just ""wear blue,"" and told our best man/ushers to ""wear whatever.""  This led a couple of them to freak out at the lack of direction, and we ended up having to give some more specific guidelines after all."
They've mistyped and meant to visit r/arguewithwomen?
"My boyfriend knows I’m going to start my period before I do because “I smell different.” 

Edit: a letter "
Hooooo boy. A lot to unpack here. I'll keep it short and say fuck everything about this person
"and its corollary, ""you need to do laundry, you can't just wear my clothes"""
"Frida Kahlo. I love her artwork and her life is so much more fascinating than Diego Rivera's. As a Mexican American woman, I love how much more visible her art has become and that, albeit posthumously, she has earned respect in her own right as more than just ""Diego's little wife who dabbles in painting."" She overcame impossible odds to create a deeply soulful body of art that captures what it was like to be a Mexican woman navigating the wonders of the 20th century while still aiming to honor her heritage. I identify with that dichotomy a lot and her art is a way of reconciling this.

But lately I feel like people take the Frida worship a little *too* far. I recently saw a little altar for sale in a Mexican shop that had both La Virgen de Guadalupe and Frida on it and thought it was super weird. Frida was no saint. She wasn't even religious. Frida Kahlo is a fascinating woman to study, but I'm not sure I understand how she's become this larger-than-life demi-goddess. It's too much."
"My sister's husband apparently while sleeping once said, in a terrible British accent, ""I call this, *The Davenport*!""

Then he farted real loud."
"There's that song, ""I Hate Everything About You"" that came out in the early 2000s. The opening line is, ""Every time we lie awake, after every hit we take...""

But, that song on the radio was always censored. So, it sounded like, ""Every time we lie awake, after every --t we take,"" and I have never been a drug user and I had no idea that ""hit"" would be used in the song or be censored.

So, when I was younger, I was very confused by but certain that the line was, ""Every time we lie awake, after every shit we take."""
i got angry reading this 
"The money thing is where it really comes out. My ex grew up kinda poor so when he started making a lot of money in IT, he was a jerk about it. I lived with him part time because I'd just moved out of my place, and he insisted we split rent on his downtown apartment and everything down the middle. I was making $12 an hour, he was making close to $40, and he didn't understand why I couldn't manage it. He talked down to me about money all the time."
Because it would be inconvenient for (some) men if their wives stopped playing a supporting role in their lives and started being a chief protagonist in their own right. They aren't inconvenienced by their daughters flourishing in the same way.
"When I was a bridesmaid once, I was told that whilst I was invited to the wedding, my fiancé was not. Why you might ask? Well the bride didn’t want the fact that there was a lesbian couple at her wedding upstaging her event. Yup that’s right, she thought that having two women who were in a relationship at her wedding was going to be a bigger talking point and what people would remember her wedding by."
"""Excuse me miss, would you kindly be a leviathan with me? Thank you."""
"Girls won't date me because I also like boys. Or they will, and they are insecure I'll leave them for a boy."
"I may be a little biased since I'm a romance writer and trust me, I deal with this quite often, even from other writers in different genres.  The tiers are this: clean romance, romance, romance erotica, erotica.  Erotica is straight-up porn, clean romance has no sex, and the other two fall in between.  Something like 50 Shades, I would classify as romance erotica, so definitely more porn-ish than regular romance.  Then there's the whole ""bodice ripper"" stereotype.

Just like all other genres, there will be good books and bad books, but romance is unfortunately, a genre where people believe the latter, that they lack depth, plot, and character development.  I've read a lot of amazing romance novels and I've read a lot of terrible ones.  Same goes for fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, and contemporary novels.

Ultimately, I think romance gets a bad rep because it's seen as a genre for women.  I think people think that all of romance is light and fluffy beach reading, without emotional depth or an intriguing story, and because of that, it's a lesser genre.  It might not be to everyone's taste, but I also think that a lot of people won't give the genre a try because of it."

Once the relationship starts though, the biggest issues arise from:

"When we went bridesmaid dress shopping, she kept putting me in dresses that did *not* work for my body. Like not just that they weren’t flattering, but that I would be the only bridesmaid that had to wear a bra under a dress *and the bra was visible* because of the cutouts in the dress or whatever and the bride shrugged and was like “oh well.” It was embarrassing and I felt like a stuffed sausage. 

She also kept bringing me size 8 dresses (I’m a 12-14) and when I would say I couldn’t fit it, she said “wow I had no idea you were **that big.**”

I was the maid of honor. I have a lovely, heartfelt, teary-eyed speech where I made a good-natures joke about the groom’s mustache (it was awful and LOTS of people had asked incredulously if he was going to keep it for the wedding.) The joke went over well, but afterward, neither the bride or groom hugged me or said thank you or anything. They literally walked off the stage. Three weeks later, the bride’s only comment was “when you said that I thought you were making a joke about mustache rides.” Yes, because I’m 12 and also trash...

She never thanked me for anything at all. Not even in passing. She was the most disorganized, flippant bride I’ve ever seen, I stepped the fuck *up* and slayed the maid of honor game and she never even acted like she appreciated anything. "
"Was sexting with my ex gf and she asked me for sexy pics, so I sent her the sexy Jeff Goldblum picture. I thought it was hilarious till a few weeks later we were watching a video we made and when I reached the point of no return she tabbed over to Danny Devito. "
"Yes sex was amazing but not just that. The whole build up to it was really... *chill* I guess. At no point did I feel pressured to sleep with him, he made it clear we could stop whenever I wanted, just made me feel really really comfortable. Then we had some of the best sex of my life.

In this town it seems like everyone is sleeping with everyone honestly."
"I  got a [cute little kitten](https://imgur.com/a/8Q01TsD) a few weeks ago. She doesn't always like to hug, but as all cats, she can be tempted with food. So whenever I want to hug, I shake the little bag of cat snacks and she comes as fast as her paws can carry her and give her some candy. Then she leaves, sits on her butt a few feet away and stares me dead in the face awaiting more snacks. Yeah, as if I just give them to her. ^butIusuallydo"
"Whenever I have something in the oven, my Congo African Grey parrot will make the sound of the oven timer beeping. She’ll also imitate the phone and the sound of someone knocking at my door. When I go to check said things, she’ll proceed to cackle evilly. "
"He had a grand mal seizure.  Unprecedented and shocking.  I was driving us home and he was in the passenger seat and started acting strange.  Staring off into the distance while doing repetitive tics with his hands.  I kept asking him what was wrong and saw that he was completely checked out.

I kept driving as we were near home and he suddenly was twitching his head and making noises.  I pulled over on the side of the road and pulled him out of the car onto the side of the road.  I laid him out straight and called 911.  I tried to hold him down, but he is much stronger than I am, especially when he is using all his strength as he seemed to be doing.  I have been told it is not necessarily the right thing to hold a seizure victim, but you try dealing with that kind of surprise.

That whole incident scared the shit out of me.  And continues to scare me because we have no real way to prevent it from happening again or even predict if it will happen again."
"She had two weddings, one official one at City Hall where just me and a few others came so they could document the process as legitimate (typical green card procedure) and a big expensive one in her home country that I was also booked flights to attend. I was her best friend since high school. She got mad at me because I didn't buy a new dress for her city hall wedding, saying I wasn't taking it seriously. There was no dress code and I had a perfectly acceptable dress that I'd worn to weddings before, but she hated the fact that I hadn't bought it specifically for the ceremony that didn't even have official bridesmaids. I was attending as a witness (and a friend) and she hadn't relayed to me before that she'd expected me to purchase a new dress for this smaller occasion; obviously I was planning to for her family wedding where we would have actual bridesmaids and wedding photographers. She accused me of not putting in as much effort as her other friends and said I wasn't ""acting like a best friend."" When I told her I didn't have the money to spend on two bridesmaids dresses, she snapped at me that I ""could have just bought a cheap F21 dress and even that would have been putting in more effort than nothing.""

When the big ceremony came around (wedding #2), another of her friends suggested that she get gifts for all the bridesmaids, as is tradition (as gratitude for throwing a bridal shower, buying our own dresses, spending our own money for flights/accommodations, and basically being her wedding slaves until the big day). She went ballistic at the suggestion, asking why *she* had to go the extra mile for something that wasn't even an official wedding ceremony and just for show (essentially contradicting herself when she had previously gotten upset that my worn dress wasn't good enough). She complained how she already had so much on her plate and how she shouldn't need to spend extra time/money on bridesmaids because that's what friends were for.

**Suggestions for brides:** don't act entitled to anything, be grateful. A lot of people who love you are willing to bend over backwards to make your wedding perfect but we all have our limitations, and being treated like we're disposable or that you aren't grateful for our energy is discouraging. Weddings truly bring out the worst in people; I understand it's a stressful time for everyone, but take a step back and determine whether a tiny trivial detail is worth ruining long-term friendships over. Communicate clearly about your expectations to avoid confusion."
"Scented tampons.

"Super twitchy in his sleep. Freaks me out cause he’ll have literal full-body spasms that shake me awake. 

He sleeps just fine though. Not sure why he twitches but I think it’s just him dreaming."
"The way men talk about other women is what sets off alarms for me, gender-specific slurs especially. If they like you, and you're not like 'other women', or if all their exes are bitches/whores, if their female boss is a cunt... Obviously this is a dude that likes women fine ... until they do something that is outside of his box of 'acceptable' behavior. "
"Celebrate their life and love them. I have never stopped loving my childhood let dog and she died 17 years ago. I still talk about her when it is relevant to the conversation. 

The grieving processes doesn't always start with the death happening first. It's okay if you want to cry, or get angry, or anything else. You love your cat. She means something to you. Or else you wouldnt be feeling all the things you are about the situation you are now faced with. 

I am sorry for her illness. I am sure she is happy with the life you were able to provide for her and loves you too."
"This doesn’t totally answer your question but is related. Something I’ve noticed is the way my dad sometimes speaks to and treats my mother which upsets me, and I realised that if he saw my partner behaving that way to me he would be so angry. He would lose it. But yet it seems fine when he is like that to his wife. I think part of it is he doesn’t want to accept or change his own behaviour, or acknowledge that it is wrong - even though he would immediately see and label it wrong if a man I was in a relationship with treated me that way. I’ve also noticed that when my brother talks to me and my mum and treats us in really sexist, misogynistic ways, my father doesn’t care. I think this is for the same or similar reasons that he ignores his own behaviour. "

"How even after being together for almost 5 years, he will sometimes forget to tell me things. Like, important things a significant other should know.

For example, losing control in his car while it was raining one time and drive into a ditch. (He was okay and was able to drive out and his car wasn't damaged). I didn't find out for months and he only passively told me during a random conversation. 

He's gotten a lot better about it the longer we've been together. He's finally realizing that I'm not going anywhere and that he's not alone in life. Every once and a while I wonder if there's anything he forgot to tell me.

My husband called my mom (an outspoken feminist) a couple hours before he proposed and said he was gonna propose tonight and he was really nervous. They laughed and talked about the ring and she welcomed him to the family. There was never a request for permission or a blessing. It was more about him beginning to establish a relationship with her. We live 1500 miles away. I was happy with how it went down. My dad died when I was ten so I’ve never understood any kind of man-as-head-of-household situation.

"It has been discovered that one of the guys at work has been drafting and sending ""State of the Boobion"" emails to some of the other guys, wherein he's been detailing the neckline and/or cleavage levels of some of us girls at work to note who should be paid attention on which day. He's been doing it for about a week. NONE of the guys who received the emails asked for or even appreciated getting them, the guy just did it on his own. I was forwarded one of them, and I'm listed on it. Apparently he's disappointed that I didn't wear a padded bra the other day like I normally do, so I was not worthy of extra attention that day.

The guy writing the email was immediately let go. The guys who received them are still here, but all now have to go to sexual harassment courses because they didn't turn him in right away. Us girls listed in the emails are being provided counseling sessions if needed.

It's absolutely disgusting. None of the recipients saying a damn word about it until yesterday, when they realized he was just going to keep doing it. These are guys that I go to lunch with on a regular basis, and none of them said a word to me about it. The guy writing them is a pretty well known creep here, honestly I'm not shocked that it was him, but I'm hurt that my work friends didn't speak up right away. It's so gross."

Rings the bell and checks to see if I left it on the table within reach. Wants a toy my other dog is playing with? Rings the bell so that dog goes to join him, leaving the toy for the talking.

"He would laugh when I got upset because it was ""cute."" It didn't matter if I was burning mad at him or having a panic attack that ends in hysterical crying. If I was showing an emotion I became a ""silly girl"" to him, my feelings be damned. It was insulting but also didn't lead to any fruitful conversation. If I suggested in any way that I was unhappy, he would just giggle and tell me I was ""emotional"" so therefore couldn't have any reasoning or logic to how I felt.

Their goal, unconscious or not, is to make it so unpleasant for you to bring up problems that you decide it's not worth it.  They never have to hear your issues, so they get to ignore them.  "

"I worked at starbucks when I first met him so he dictated from atop his high throne about how I should make money and what I needed to do.

When I called dad I was angry but I tried to keep my cool. I informed him that his drinking was getting out of hand and that they way he treated his wife was far from acceptable behavior. Of course dad got mad and defensive. He started to yell. Until I reminded him that he was acting the way my ex-husband had acted in the beginning, that chipping away at anyone little by little will not be tolerated in our family again. He shut up at that point. I let my words sink in for a bit. Then he uttered the words ""how do I fix this? I don't want to ever be anything like that horrible man."" At that point we were able to have a long, constructive conversation. 

Now when he starts acting like an ass all any of us have to say is 'Rockstar81's ex-husband' and his behavior changes. Dad just needed to be reminded that he should treat his wife the way he wants his daughter to be treated. "

"Biggest ones in my past relationship were:

-He would fight me on any opinion that didn’t align with his. It was clear he had no respect for what I thought and continually shot down what I had to say. 

-He called feminists many unpleasant things and insisted they were just being bitchy and argued that if they really wanted equality they should stop expecting to be taken care of. 

-He treated his sister very badly and would insult her every time they interacted. 

-He would act disgusted if he saw an unattractive woman and point out that they were fat, had bad hair, wore ugly clothes, etc. 

-Legitimately said that he had trouble viewing women as anything but sex objects because he watched so much porn.

"I don’t know if this technically falls under the question, but I hate the assumption that my partner and I are sisters. My fiancée and I look nothing alike, aside from being white. I’m a good 6 inches taller than her, we don’t wear the same size, her family is Italian (so she’s very tan, especially in the summer), and I’m super pale. The list of differences is far larger than the list of similarities. Yet, we still get asked if we’re sisters. 

Also, dating pool. When I was dating, it was so hard to find someone to date who I found attractive and interesting. Most of those that I did find attractive and interesting, all ran in the same crowd.  

Always getting separate checks at restaurants, instead of one together. We always pay together, and restaurant staff always assumes it’s separate. 

The self consciousness that I feel when someone points out that we’re getting ugly looks of harassment because of mild pda. Though this one is more specific to just me. 

When people think that our relationship not being a secret is an invitation to ask about our sex life. 

The assumption that just because my fiancée dresses more masculine that she is trying to be a man. There are no gender roles in our relationship, we’re equals.

It's not even that I wanted recognition (honestly), but I was flabbergasted that the MoH did nothing and was praised for it. It took me almost six months to get her to pay me back for her outfit and I didn't get a thank your or a fuck you for it.

Oh my fuck. 
"*oh boy*

Our company was bought out, and within ten months about 20% of the workforce had been laid off.  A lot of other people read the writing on the wall and left.  Morale was *low.*

We got an email from our parent company that (basically) said that, in order to boost morale, they would be enacting a business formal dress code AND ask us to keep our cubes neat and any decorations 'tasteful and minimal'.   They believed that morale was low because people dressed business-casual/casual and our desks were too messy.  If we (and our spaces) looked nice, then we could really take pride in our work!  It had nothing to do with many of our projects being cancelled and our friends getting laid off!

I think the worst thing was that, for about a week, I saw executives from the parent company actually coming into our spaces and commenting on what people wore and how their desks looked.  One of the developers on my team typically wore athletic wear to work, and I overheard one of the execs ask another ""Does she actually add value?"" and scoff at her appearance.  They told another coworker that he had to take down drawings his daughter made for him.  *It was bad.*"
"Well to set the scene, I work in a recruitment company and it's mostly women staff which is great and we all get on fab.

We obviously get a lot of clients and people looking for jobs through our doors and quite often we'll get a really nice looking guy come through our doors, all dressed up in a suit for a pre-interview before we put them forward for roles with our clients. There is this one guy that comes in quite regularly, very handsome and seems quite smart and intelligent but we're always a bit curious why he keeps coming in if he's continually looking for a job. He has one of the girls looking after him in terms of liaising with clients and putting him forward for roles and at times they'll go out of the office to the local coffee place to discuss his CV and such.

A few of us girls think there is something going on there and it's all starting to add up, she's often more dressed up when he's due to come in, there's a bit of winking and nodding going on, they've been seen in his car together and probably the tell tale sign is she'll often fix her makeup just after seeing him.

I'm willing to bet there is some afternoon delight going on there but don't want to be the one to snitch on her at all, plus she is lovely."

"Jesus. 

I got married a couple years ago and my sister was my only bridesmaid. She’s leaps and bounds hotter than me in every metric. I legit asked nicely if I could, just this one day, be the pretty one and she agreed! She found her least flattering blue dress (she still looked great in it, but it hid a good bunch of her figure), kind of clumpy shoes, and used a foundation that didn’t quite match (that last one was her idea). We had a bunch of laughs about it and she just tried to stay out of pictures. "

I opened it, read the title post, and was 0% surprised that the thread got locked within 2 hours. The OP of that thread just constantly mocked and argued with the women that replied, yet when called out tried to claim that they were “just curious” and “wanted to know what women thought.” But he only argued vehemently with the posters that said we didn’t like him. Like yeah okay, you totally came to a women’s sub loaded with armfuls of evo-psych bullshit about why we’re inferior just because you’re *curious.* 🙄🙄🙄"

"I’ve been a bridesmaid many times, and although I’m always honored and the brides have been wonderful, I still don’t really enjoy it.

When I got married I didn’t have bridesmaids because I didn’t want my friends to have to go through the bridesmaid rigamarole. 

The most recent wedding I was in the bride actually put a lot of thoughts into our gifts. They included a book and pair of socks hand selected by the bride based on our interests and were really sweet. "

Yeah, I’d find it weird if men wanted their daughters to be “attractive” as a most important quality. Most parents find their kids cute (my son is told he’s handsome as cute a million times a week). But “I want my daughter to be attractive?” That statement would range from odd to creepy depending upon exact phrasing and tone. And I think it would go both ways too; “attractiveness” wouldn’t make my top two immediate things I’d list about my husband’s best qualities but yeah, it’s important I find him attractive.

The question is flawed because, well, of course “attractiveness” is more important in a romantic/sexual relationship than for your child (eww).

If we set aside the “attractiveness” part and just look at say, “sweet” vs. “strong” and “intelligent,” the data on the article actually shows “intelligence” as being very important for wives as well. It’s only one “dot” below intelligence for daughters, suggesting that many men surveyed did want an intelligent wife.

As for “sweet” vs. “strong?” The situational difference may play a role too. I could see my father (or my husband if we had girls) saying they want “strong” daughters but wouldn’t say the same about my mother/me if they were limited in the words they could select. I hope my father believes himself to be a good man (because he is) and therefore I assume he believes it’s less important that my mom be “strong” than he did for my sister and me when we were younger; because my mom has him (and him, her) to help be strong. So, yeah, it’s situational; he trusts himself but not other people to not take advantage of his kids.

I’m not denying that men can have horrendous views about women (because that should be obvious), but the study doesn’t really make sense to me and the methods are odd."

"benevolently sexist attitudes. i'm not talking basic things like holding doors, but bragging about how they were taught to treat women ''right'' - taking off coats, pulling out chairs, paying for everything, how no wife of theirs will work, etc. brags that he's looking for a woman to treat ''like a queen''.

"Honestly, my experience with romance novels has not been very good. (By both male and female authors). A lot of the time they come off like obvious wish-fulfillment fantasies, which just make me uncomfortable. The characters tend to be annoying. Too much description on appearance. Underdeveloped personalities.

I'm sure not all romance novels are like that, but I've had an easier time weeding through bad fanfiction than bad novels. And I feel like one thing that helps destigmatize what you read is to just be unapologetic about liking it. People are just as likely to think fanfiction is just gay porn. I let my friends know I like writing/reading fanfiction. I'll sometimes discuss the plots of what I've read."
"My boyfriend and I met at work. When we met, there was a strict “no-dating” policy in place that later got lifted. After it was lifted, we began dating, and per the new policy, we reported our relationship to our direct supervisor.

Even though the only person we informed was our direct supervisor, by the next day, our entire workplace new about us. And they were hateful. We were discriminated against, ostracized, and made to follow a different set of rules than everyone else. We were also no longer scheduled to work directly together, and when I asked my supervisor if the policy stated we couldn’t, he said that that wasn’t part of the policy and denied treating us differently. We were also counted collectively as “one person,” so that if we both expressed the same opinion, it’ was treated as the word of one person instead of the word of two. It got so bad that we both eventually quit that job. 

A month later, I find out on Facebook that two more people from the same workplace have started dating. Except this time, the man involved in the relationship is married. And everyone was congratulating the new couple, praising them for how “cute” they were together. 
 
I’ll never understand why my boyfriend and I got so much hate coming forward with our relationship when a married man can be congratulated for doing the same thing. "
"Malcolm X. Most (white) people think of him as instigating violence and hatred, in direct opposition to MLK's message of love, but if you read his autobiography, you see that:

a) he really prioritized teaching black men to love and appreciate themselves in a way that no else really had on such a public stage 

b) his hatred towards white people at the time came about because of all the shit that happened to him in his life. So OK, it's not ideal, but I think we should try to understand it rather than getting defensive

c) he actually evolved his way of thinking about the world numerous times as he aged (including getting to a point of realizing some white people could be taught to be allies)

His stance on women was pretty shitty, in a mostly patronising paternalistic way. But I think he deserves a lot more credit than being written off as a preacher of violence; he was a smart, thoughtful guy."

But if you leave me for a man, I am left with a gaping hole that my essence, my very nature and body, is inadequate. You choosing a man over me validates my fear that there is something special about dicks, because why would you date a man except for his dick, especially when you could have a woman like me?""

"I assume maybe sexual submission and domestic control has something to do with it. They want their wives as sexually and emotionally available as possible because this benefits them in certain ways. Having intelligent and non-dependant daughters, however (assuming they live in a rich nation) assures him more assets and social status partially due to name recognition and her being his offspring/blood... and also that's one less woman being dependant on him who isn't (hopefully) sexually and emotionally available to him.

Edit: Typo. ""maybe"", not ""may be"""

"We are too small to have, like, a company Christmas party or anything like that.  So instead, my boss just takes us all out to see every Star Wars movie that comes out.  We also can't afford a cafeteria, so he just subscribed us to a jerky of the month club and regularly buys us pizza.  He's the best :D"
"My mom is the same way with stuff like that. Always being the devils advocate when it comes to rapists. I've always suspected that she was sexually abused growing up, and tries to sympathies with rapists because maybe the person that hurt her was close to her (her dad was accused of sexually abusing one of his granddaughters, so there's that.)"
"He’ll fall victim to the occasional conspiracy theory. Actually he initially believes a lot of them, but I’m able to talk him out of 90% of them with logic. He’s very anti-establishment and isn’t good at evaluating the trustworthiness of different sources, which leads to him believing stupid shit he saw on a YouTube video.

Like no lie, for about half an hour he thought the Newton shooting was faked. Thankfully I talked him out of that one. He also believed some of the lizard theories, until I explained the racist and anti-Semitic basis for them. He still wavers in what he thinks about vaccines, but I told him our children are getting them no matter what and I don’t need his permission anyway. I’m dreading what the next theory he’ll fall for will be.

I know that’s not necessarily scary... but it scares me how bad he is at logically evaluating this kind of stuff. "
Bic pens “for her”. Not pens. Just the “elegant” ones labelled“for her”. Because they are irrelevant and why do they exist.

About Time or Land Before Time. 
"Absolutely, and in some ways women are instrumental to keep toxic masculinity going, since it's more common for women to punish other women for social infrictions. Especially as a teen this enforcement of toxic masculinity becomes incredibly overwhelming. Girls calling each others sluts, trying to distance themselves from their own gender because they view it negatively to be feminine, every feminine interest is put down as stupid or pointless. I feel i see this much less now that I'm in my 20's although that might also have to do with the fact that I can pick who I hang out with now so I've mostly surrounded myself with other feminists"
Are you married ?
"The non-apology apology. ""I'm sorry if you feel like I hurt you"" vs. ""I'm sorry that I hurt you."" It's a subtle difference, but it bothers me when people use the former. "
"In my 40’s (Almost dead in teen talk). Going back this September to study Psychology after raising my kids. So excited. At this point, I knew I wouldn’t be happier doing anything else so I just had to go for it. "
"All of the above, but also constantly correcting little tiny things. Literally everything, from how I folded towels to the clothes I wore. Would actually say he was trying to help me, teach me, make me better. Only he knew the one correct way for everything to be done. 

I should have been alarmed by the fact that he wanted to date me and proposed within 3 months when I was 22 and he was 30. Should have, but wasn't. Took over five years of marriage and escalating mental and physical abuse before I could gtf out. Four years later, he is exactly the same, exercising control the only way he can (through the kids) but we're all far better off. "

Me, holding the door open: Okay, then here you go.

"Fairness creams. They're a pretty big deal in my country, where fair skin = beautiful. Thankfully, a lot of channels are refusing to air fairness cream commercials, and I'm so glad because a lot of the kids from my generation grew up seeing ads that showed a dark-skinned woman getting a dream job/boyfriend after using the cream and becoming lighter, and that has really made them hate their skin.

I'm leaving my job at a pretty critical time and my last day is Friday. My manager is only just coming to the realization that she wont have me so shes been in a rotten mood. I gave her a month notice and she only just replaced me late last week. I've met the guy once and asked him if I would be training him this week and he had no idea. It's a big mess and everyone is having problems with her right now.

Somebody told me you had a boyfriend that looked like a girlfriend 
"Girl in class was asking around for a tampon. I gave her one, and a guy said, “that’s hot.” Apparently he thought tampons were like dildos and we were sharing it, so he thought it was “hot.”"
"I’m a guy, and I was pretty free with my emotions as a kid. 

I remember when I stopped. I was 8 , and my thumb got mangled when a car door slammed on it. I was *howling*. My mom got angry at me and yelled at me about how boys don’t cry as she drove me to the hospital.

After that I learned people feel *contempt* for you if you cry. I didn’t cry again after that, I got angry and yelled at people instead.

 Nobody tells you aren’t being a boy when you yell at people.

"I had been working as an artist/designer for 15 years at a small design company. I loved what I did so I put up with a lot of crap for many years but I began to feel unfulfilled and under appreciated so I enrolled in college for the first time at 37, after not even graduating high school. I waited until my son was graduating from high school. I always wanted to go into Engineering so I did. I went part time while working full time and it took me 4 1/2 years to get my AA in general Engineering. Then I got accepted into the industrial engineering program at UCF. So I quit my job which was a very scary decision since I have worked full time since I was 16 and decided to attend school full time. I’m in the home stretch so I felt it was necessary to finish before I was 50, lol. 

I completed 2 semesters, then got an internship at a medical device manufacturer as a process engineer for this summer. It was the second application I put in for an internship. I applied on Wednesday, got an email Thursday, had a phone interview Friday, went in for a real interview Monday, and was hired 2 weeks later. I was able to make a difference in a company that helps disabled people live a normal life, which is something I’m very passionate about.  They asked me to come back over the holidays and next summer. 

I also just applied for the accelerated BS to MS program for Engineering management and got accepted so I’m making my dreams a reality.  Doing all this was the best decision I have ever made in my life.  It amazes me every day what I have accomplished. When it’s all said and done, I’ll have a masters in industrial engineering, specializing in Engineering management with a mathematics minor. Not too bad for a high school dropout "
One person mooches off the shared office K-cup supply. Everyone else brings a box to share each month but noooooo not this girl.
I'm extremely oblivious and I was going on friend dates and having friend sex and saying friend I love yous to somebody and like nine months in we had a clash of realities when we both realized the other had a completely different idea of what was going on. I thought she wasn't into me that way.

"Exist in a world where I have no control over his safety.

I used to make a boyfriend drive to work with an inflatable raft in his car. I had nightmares about the bridge collapsing on his commute and that was my way of solving it. I knew it was illogical but lord did it ever help knowing it was there.

The world at large is scary and big and he's so precious. "
"After I left the church, I stopped dressing modestly in favor of clothing that actually fit my frame, was comfortable, easy to move in and was figure flattering. I tried out different bold styles. I cut my hair, started styling it (in sinful braids!) and started dyeing it, I started to wear makeup and jewelry. I started to diet and hit the gym and I spent time out in the sun."
"Really bothered. And the example you gave is a perfect one. I have started commenting on it when we have family lunches etc. at my parent’s house, and asking the men to help us with things. There is no reason they can’t help, and no reason they shouldn’t. "

" She jumps in my bed at 5 a.m and starts to make noises because she wants food. So I just crawl out of my bed and make my way out to the fridge and give her what she wants hoping that it will calm her down.

"I don't know what is and isn't considered ""toxic masculinity"", but if the whole deal of ""virgin-shaming"" is toxic masculinity, then that's just one of the many things that women sure do enforce on a regular basis.

Not only in real life, I've seen it everywhere, including this subreddit. There are a lot of people, both men and women, who use ""virginity"" as an insult aimed at men, which to me would definitely fall under toxic masculinity.

The amount of girls/women in real life that love to say things like ""Man up"", ""I want a guy who's strong"" (mentally, physically - heard enough about both), ""I don't want to be with a pussy"" is higher than you think."

Giving unsolicited health advise just based on appearance
"The following is one of my favourite saved items. It was originally posted by Impudence on the subject of why ""there are no girls on the internet"" is a thing. I hope she doesn't mind me reposting it here.

&gt; Not to pull a ""get off my lawn"" or anything, but having been on the internet since the late 80's with BBS* (I hate you autocorrect) type shit, Atari's Genie and IRC even before AOL was a thing, it's straight up sexism. It's always been sexism. I've had the curious perspective of being able to see the evolution of this particular phenomenon over time.

&gt; It's a concept of a boys club that never was brought on by anonymity, a sense of male as default and ignorance of just how many people out there were female. At first, I think it was honestly just out of ignorance and a sense of ""well I'm a dude therefore everyone is a dude"" and when women, early on, brought up their gender they'd be pounded by PM requests in chatrooms. Didn't help that so many pub chats in the early-mid 90's straight up consisted half of the nerd mating call, ""A/S/L"". A lot of women just didn't bother talking about their gender out of fear of getting those pm's out of nowhere ""want to cyber?"" FFS I was 14 in the early early days of the wider internet when I learned to make a gender neutral name out of fear of constant sexual harassment

&gt; Time went on, video game companies stopped marketing to girls in general unless they were specific ""pinkified"" games despite the fact the user base didn't change all that much. As technology improved and voice became a thing, women didn't use it as much because of sexualization or being mistaken for 14 year old boy. (hmm... which sounds more appealing. Ransom dick pics, being called an adolescent and not taken seriously or just being silent)

&gt; It was made worse by 4chan's shitty-ass meme that declared if a woman indicates her gender in any way, she's only doing it for attention because ""gender doesn't matter online"" as though it's some sort of flat meritocracy despite the unironic ""tits or GTFO"" and extreme harassment of so many women online on a gendered basis.

&gt; So many of these idiots who claim it's not gendered have no issue with men claiming their own gender either overtly and outrightly or through other means and they'll quickly and angrily correct anyone who calls them by the wrong pronoun. However, dare a feeemale to politely correct someone ""actually, it's she"" Even after a whole story about their first period while they were trying on bras, with their boyfriend, and their mother who shares their same name etc etc is met with ""NOBODY CARES IF YOU""RE A GIRL ATTENTION WHORE"" type stuff. It could be really aggressive and seriously uncalled for. Meanwhile men freely talked to each other about being men, about their genitals, about what they find sexually appealing and once reddit opened up to more than just technology- Oh god the sexual imagery of women. Why might women not flock to it with all the comments in those thread? It's a fucking mystery.

&gt; I created this subreddit after twoxchromosomes was too inundated by men asking ""DO WOMEN LIKE X..."" questions./r/Twoxchromosomes is so named because /r/women was snapped up by power user men who give no fucks about it- to this day. They just wanted the name.

&gt; Shortly after creating this subreddit it was flooded with ""WHY IS THERE NO ASKMEN"" and most conversations were about men despite trying to carve out a space where women could answer questions. Any questions. Because seriously askreddit was askmen back then. ""reddit, what kind of boobs do you like"" ""reddit, who is hotter, Selma Hayak or Natalie Portman"" ""reddit, when was the last time you caught your dick in your zipper"". Good luck trying to ask about Brad Pitt Vs Johnny Depp- the funny thing is they were more likely to assume you were gay than a woman.

&gt; So this space was created. We existed. A lot of people still didn't believe we were women and a lot of people still didn't believe our opinions mattered. On anything. At all. Even one of the mods of askmen had the fucking audacity to come here and post that shitty 4chan meme about ""no girls on the internet ""because gender doesn't matter"" Mother fucker, you mod a subreddit called askmen. Clearly gender matters to you.

&gt; The message is gender matters, but only if that gender is male. If it's female, it should be silent and unnoticed.

&gt; Edit: if you came here to reply to me to defend this nonsense, stoppit. First off, I've got shit to do today so I'm not going to he each and every one of your hands and patiently explain to you why it's pretty clear you didn't read any of that wall of text up there and that you're still being sexist. Second I don't need a legion of 20 year olds trying to explain a thing to me that I watched develop while y'all were still watching Dora the explorer. Third, y'all are completely bypassing the fact that pEople say it TO women. Actual women. Not men they think are pretending to be women but to women. To shut them up. Literally. It's a thing they do. Tell womb to not talk about th fact that they're women even when relevant to the conversation (which again goes back to the fact that those twits didn't bother to read this shit, they just wanted to assert themselves by proclaiming, apparently, I either don't exist or I'm an attention whore or a dude or a banshee or a land shark or something.)"

"I just got hired as an administrative assistant last month. I work in a small department within a medium sized school within a huge university, so I should just be a tiny cog in the machine, right? Well, apparently my being hired has pissed off quite a few people. It turns out that my department head sacrificed part of his operational budget in order to pay my salary and convinced the dean to let him have an assistant. Other department heads within our school are now upset that *they* don't have an assistant and feel my boss is getting special treatment. I only know about all this because my boss gave me a heads up that I might hear some unpleasant things said about him, and that other department heads might try to dump some of their work on me, as they seem to think they should all share me. It's been a fun month."
I hate it. My sister has treated him this way from the day he was born. I don’t think she should have had children. 
"* We can just hold it until we get to a bathroom

* We bleed a for a day and then it's over

* Alternately, we just gush blood for days (hence the ""bleed for five days without dying"" joke)

* We get off from inserting tampons

* We wear tampons all the time, ""just in case""

* We can't pee with a tampon in"
"Worse. Anti-vaxxer's think they're keeping their children healthy. Mother Teresa ***wanted*** her patients to be unhealthy. In her view, the more sick and dying someone was, the closer to God they were."
"I've seen it with older women, such as my own mother. It's kinda hard to change someone's mind when they grew up with x mindset. Everytime she ""enforces toxic masculinity"" all I do is try to have a discussion about it and try to show her a different perspective.. but it's incredibly hard to convince some people. I don't argue or get upset because I understand that we've  grown up in different times, but I still always try to show her another perspective. Maybe one day it will click. "
A Little Princess gets me every time.
"I hated it, but I was ""expected"" to ask her father before proposing. Reluctantly, I pulled him aside at a family gathering and asked. He said yes and marched downstairs to announce it to the family. They all cheered.

As stupid as that tradition is, the worse part is that she never got an actual proposal. No romantic setting, no knee, no ring. I thought asking him was step 1, not the finally. I had so many plans...

20 years later, we both regret no doing our own thing. We were young and didn't really know what was important to us yet. I wish we had a proposal story to tell. I wish I would have had a ring ready. I wish the most important decision of our lives was made by just the two of us. I wish I didn't feel cheated.

The permission tradition is sexist and belittling, and I will encourage our children to do what feels right to them."
"With a blatantly homophobic attitude like that, you probably would have upstaged her by just being good people "
"We had been casual friends for a couple of years after that but then it was her birthday and her and her husband were going to be having a party at their house. She asked if I would come early to watch the baby while they got all the last minute stuff together. I agreed. Show up and expect to watch the baby but instead was asked to do dishes, pass around hors d'oeuvres and then help clean up. I left early. 
That was when I stopped returning her calls."
Public pranking.
"My SO has bipolar disorder and had a break down a few months ago. He wanted to commit suicide and spoke about it very clearly and concisely. He didn't have a plan, a fact his doctors said was good, but he did know exactly why he didn't want to be alive. He didn't factor me in at all. He was in so deep, he couldn't see me anymore. 

This was a result of a temporary doctor haphazardly taking him off of his meds after his actual doctor quit the practice without notice. We found new doctors. He's back on meds. Everything is much better. But it wasn't for a while there and it could very well happen again. At any time. For however long. "
"I have a friend who subscribes to ""traditional"" gender stereotypes to a T. From minor things such as believing burgundy is for girls and teal is for boys, to an overall attitude towards relationships. From what I could gather, she doesn't talk back to her boyfriend when she disagrees and made sure she dresses in a way that pleases him. It's kinda sad when women have internalised that men are supposed to be dominant in a hetero relationship. 

This made me think critically about whether I have internalised any of these attitudes as well and if they manifest themselves in small ways. "
"Not me, my best friend- pretty early on her boyfriend asked her for a list of anyone she’d ever slept with, what kind of positions they did it in, when she lost her virginity etc. and not in a “I want to learn how to please you in bed” type of way, in a possessive, I want to shut you away from anyone you have history with and judge you for being a sexual person type of way. Of course he had slept with 4x the amount of people she had though. "
"I think people are more likely to bring up bad experiences and complaints they have.

I orgasm most of the time I have sex. Either through PIV or otherwise. And the times I don’t is more related to the situation (tired, would rather sleep usually) and nothing my husband does or doesn’t do. And even if I don’t orgasm, I find sex enjoyable.

Some men are selfish and inconsiderate, sure. But my husband and most of my previous partners weren’t like that"
"I had a ""wear whatever you want"" wedding and my 10 year old nephew came in full ninja costume. That was unexpected."
I have always held strong belief that we are far too casual about the fact that birds can fucking talk. 
"It really makes it seem like the person is property of their parents when asking for *permission*. Kind of creeps me out.

Asking for their *blessing* is better, IMO. It is more like ""hey heads up I am going up do this thing, I would appreciate it if you wished me good luck!"" rather than ""I want to do this thing so, am I allowed to?"""
"I mean, he's not married. Why's no one looking at the married women side-eyed? Are women children, not in charge of their own faculties? Per OP, he's not coercing the women into anything. 

Damnit, you guys are making me stand up for a man."

"Angelina Jolie.

I honestly didn't know much about her except the ubiquitous Bragelina headlines and a few of her roles in some movies. A few days ago I was selling books at a HPB and pick off an unauthorized biography of hers from a shelf. Reading the back, the excerpt from the book was that her father, Jon Voight cheated on her mother, Marcheline and pretty much walked out on their lives. Because the sight of baby Angelina reminded Marcheline so much of her ex-husband, she banished her own newborn to be cared for by caretakers. Absent parents. It's actually really heartbreaking. "

i mean... anyone crying makes me uncomfortable but i don't think it is a bad thing. if you have to cry go for it. i just don't know what to say so i only hug those people lol
"Oh no :( 


He probably meant to demonstrate total focus on your pleasure, he must have been mortified when you explained. 


What helped me was to always pick my husband's soap and aftershave, so I *know* his smell. I mean, he chooses, but I have veto power over a couple bad reminders. We have a signal, too. If he feels me tense up, he'll kiss my forehead. I haven't had a flashback in years, maybe something like that can help you relax and lose yourself in good sex :)"
"Lots of reasons I probably don't know about, mostly having to do with the colonies, but the thing that sealed the deal for me was during the famine in Bengal, Canada and the US offered to send food aid. Churchill refused to allow this, because he thought the Bengalis were having too many children and this would teach them a lesson. About five million people starved to death. He also instructed officers to punish British soldiers stationed there who tried to give people food. "
It's like weddings. I think it's more fun to bond with friends over a hilarious fiasco than it is to marvel over a wonderful occasion.
Thats incredibly rude. 
"Yeah, the commoditization of Frida's image rubs me the wrong way. Though I'm a bit of a hypocrite since I own a few things with her on them. There's a great chapter about her how her legacy grew after her death in a book on heroes and hero cults in Latin America."

"I work at a financial institution. One of my coworkers is a recovering addict and seems to only date other people who are in recovery. After a long string of random hook ups from various dating sites, she got a boyfriend. He is a heroin addict who is on parole for writing bad checks and stealing debit cards. (Great for someone who works at a financial institution). She was unaware  that he was using until he was supposed to go back to jail. He skipped turning himself in, stole a cell phone from her and charged thousands of dollars on her credit card. He finally went to rehab after overdosing and has since moved in with her. Mysteriously since he’s moved in, she has had multiple credit cards opened in her name and charges on her existing credit cards and well as an Apple Pay charge. She doesn’t see that it was clearly him and is putting herself further and further into debt. She has also put him on her insurance, and given him a car., put him on accounts, Taken out loans and borrowed money from other people. We are all just genuinely concerned for her well being and don’t want to see her be used and taken advantage of. As well as worrying about her own sobriety when it inevitably all falls apart. "

"Got angry that I didn’t buy her a sex swing as a shower gift. She and her mother treated everyone like utter trash at the shower. It was EMBARASSING.

Threw a tantrum every time I told her I didn’t have two hours to discuss ribbon colors because I was in grad school ft, working and had a 3 hour commute. So like no time for anything, certainly not two hours to hear her whine about ribbon.

Was angry that she had no bachelorette after I tried to get the contact info for everyone and she said no (this was before FB). I wasn’t even MOH so this technically wasn’t my job.

Forced me to dance with this disgusting pig of a man for the wedding party dance, knowing I have an issue with strange men touching me and the guy blatantly stared at my breasts from the moment we met.

Blamed the wedding part for allowing the groom to leave the reception and get blackout drunk. Because babysitting a grown man at his wedding is normal. 

We stopped being friends after this."

"Picture it: Law School, 2015.  

A crowd is gathered in a bar for a Halloween party.  A young maiden dressed as Alice in Wonderland makes the acquiantances of three people: a Wife, the wife's Husband, and the wife's Best Friend.  Little did she know how appropriate her costume was for a rabbit hole was about to begin.

Best Friend, having one too many shots, pulls aside the maiden and tells her about her boy problems, talking about how she's not sure the person she's crazy about wants to be with her.  The maiden, wise and compassionate, comforts the woman's best friend, telling her it'll all work out and then heads out to the dance floor. 

Later on, it comes out that Best Friend was talking about the Husband.  Unbeknowst to Wife,  Best Friend and Husband had started a torrid affair a few months before the Halloween party.  Husband and Best Friend texted each other constantly, which Wife had waved off as ""friendship stuff."" Best Friend even confided in Wife about her dating problems, telling her about how she was in love with someone but wasn't sure it would work out.  Husband, overhearing and knowing it was about him, would toss in friendly advice that was secretly designed to reassure Best Friend that he was in love with her.  When Wife started to get suspicious, both Best Friend and Husband would gaslight her aggressively, doing whatever necessary to keep her from the truth.

Best Friend and Wife sat together in every law class, designed their schedules so they could learn together, and so on.  However, Wife found out about Best Friend's betrayal and the fallout was catastrophic. 

Wife was incredibly loved and popular in law school. So, when news broke, everyone sided wirh Wife and iced Best Friend out.  A social pariah, Best Friend struggled to complete her classes.  Meanwhile, Wife gets a hasty divorce (they had no kids, no real assets) while Best Friend and Husband start shacking up together.  They post all over Facebook about how they're finally together while Wife tries to pick herself up and continue her life.  Wife later remarried and has a baby, but what happened to Best Friend and Husband?

The maiden met the Best Friend again at a Swearing In Ceremony for passing the Bar.  It had been two years since Best Friend had graduated.  When maiden asked how she was doing, Best Friend said she and Husband had broken up (cheating was involved again), she was struggling, and life just wasn't that great.  This time, rather than offer her sage wisdom or amazing comforting skills, the maiden left, only wishing her the best.

Dorothy, that maiden was me.  I'll never forget the look on Best Friend's face when she attained the start of her career, but had lost everything else.

He didn't know how to address it and brought up at different points that 1. eating disorders are really hard to treat 2. mom is older and set in her ways and 3. he doesn't want her getting fat.

I asked him how he'd feel if [younger sister] was doing this and he said he'd immediately seek some form of treatment/intervention. "

"He gets constant migraines and has gone to get his eyes checked and everything. It used to be worse, like every day, but came down to a few times a week. We don’t know what’s causing him so much pain and blurry vision, neither do doctors. "
"I think this is a solid point. I can see how men would attribute a daughter's success to their contributions as a parent and how they helped meld them into the women they would become. Sadly, I also think a lot of men aren't fully aware of some of the struggles that women face in society until they have a daughter. Then all of sudden they want to fight for equality. "
"I agree about being “too chill.” My sister told us to wear yellow and the guys were to wear blue button ups; that was the only instruction.  She now says she wishes she had given more direction, because they ended up in all different shades of blue, we wore different shades and styles of yellow. It just wasn’t cohesive at all. "
"When I was little, we had a few same-sex couples in my family's social circle. I remember my mom clarifying at one point that the women across the street were ""a couple"", not just ""friends living together."" 

I pondered this in my childbrain for a moment, and then asked ""But how do they decide which one is the mommy and which is the daddy?"" 

My mom, slightly nonplussed, replied ""Uhm... it doesn't work that way. You don't need someone to be the mommy and someone to be the daddy for it to be a family."" 

And that was the end of that conversation. Which is why I've always found the ""but how will I explain gays to my kids??"" rhetoric to be puzzling. Kids accept pretty much whatever reality is presented to them."

I just asked my (feminist) husband this question and he theorized that it was because the man views his daughter as “part of him” i.e. he feels more ownership over his own genetics and thereby views his daughter as more deserving over other women. Super interesting to me because I would not have ever thought of it like that!
"Even though this happened a few years ago during my first year of law school, it'll always go down as the juiciest workplace drama I've ever seen unfold.

Usually whenever there's an incoming class of some kind, there was a Facebook group set up to introduce everyone as part of the 'Law School Name Class of 20**'. Before our first semester started, a few of us wanted to get together to meet our new classmates before the stress of school began, and a third year law student (we'll call 'Sara') who joined the group to make friends suggested that we all hang out together downtown if we happened to be in town.

At this meet up and afterwards, she became very close to this other guy in the group (we'll call Kyle) who was recently married and whose wife was planning on moving down once the semester started and she finished her grad degree in molecular biology. All the girls at the meetup agreed that Kyle was a little too handsy and flirty, especially for a guy who just got married, but that didn't stop Sara. 

They decided to hang out together on their own without the group of students from the initial ""getting to know you"" get togethers and hung out at Sara's apartment regularly. Kyle's wife doesn't think too much of it when she first hears about it, and comes to town to help set up their apartment when she can. At some point, Sara starts to get very attached to Kyle, and it's a few months later we find out why Sara didn't hang out with more law school friends her own year: She didn't have any. 

There were rumors about her getting attached quickly to guys and sleeping around, but that was all I knew. When school finally starts though, she and Kyle are practically attached at the hip and do everything together much to Kyle's wife's dismay. Kyle's wife came down multiple times during September and October out of concern and even propositioned a three way at some point as a compromise. When Kyle's wife finally confronted him if he was already cheating on her, he admitted that he had been sleeping with Sara because his wife wasn't around and he was feeling too stressed from the move. 

Kyle's wife then goes on Facebook and announced in a status update something along these lines: ""No. When you say you love me, but that you *have* to sleep with other people, that is not a marriage. We are through, you lying sack of -"" Well, you know the rest. A few of use who friended Kyle's wife saw the update and were shocked to say the least. 

According to what I heard, she kicked him out of the apartment that her parents bought for them to move into, he moved in with Sara out of necessity (and broke up with her midway through the year), she dropped out of grad school due to the stress of this whole ordeal, and now lives in the same city teaching yoga and going kayaking with three dogs on the weekends. Once word got around about what happened, both Kyle and Sara were ostracized by the rest of our classmates. 

**Additional fun fact I only found out about later** Turns out Kyle's wife actually started dating Kyle while he was in a long term relationship with another girl in college and during their study abroad in China. I'm not saying that the whole ""if he's willing to cheat with you, he's willing to cheat on you"" saying has merit or not, buuuut it does make you think."

"I think you're projecting a little too much into it and have forgotten that a partner has a different function than offspring has. And that the expectations and needs or wants therefore differe greatly by default - for both sexes.




For a partner you'd like him or her be attractive (to you) and be emotionally pleasant - someone you'd like to be around, to comfort and support you. For a typical man the nuance might be different to that of a typical woman, but I believe the core need is the same.

For your daughter ( or son for that matter ), you ( shouldn't ) care how they look. As a parent you'll always have a kinda warped perspective anyway imo. I would assume in our age intelligence and emotional strenght are more desired traits for sons and daughters alike since they'll help them with any career more than anything else.

Though I have to say that I'm no scientist who studied that."
"I think most of them are out for validation. They don't want actual opinions, they want a pat on the head. So many questions about hair, about bodies, about clothes, about underwear, about socks; what if I tan, what if I don't tan; are shorts okay, are pants okay; do women really care about money; and on and on and on. And when you don't give them the answer they want their fragile ego is bruised and they have to argue. Always need to be right. Always need to throw in an opinion where it's not asked for or warranted. My favorite is when I got into it with the sock guy and he called me ""emotional"". Like JFC you're in a women's sub looking for validation and then call a woman emotional because you didn't like their answer to you. Fucking god.

In summation: Fragile masculinity."
"Yeah, this one. School failed me so hard on him. Every time someone praises him (which is like, pretty often actually?) I launch into a rant. Same with Mother Theresa. "
"Yeah, him.

I've learned a lot more about him, and that time period, in the past few years.  Growing up I had learned that he was ""lucky"" to have discovered the Americas, but that he was this great and visionary human being.  Yeah, no.

In reality, he actually was a brilliant navigator.  In 1492 he probably knew more about Atlantic currents and winds than anyone alive, and his voyages would either never have made it, or never made it back with anyone else in charge -- he had the knowledge to position himself correctly for winds going to and coming from.  He was still wrong about the size of the world, though.  

However, as a leader and administrator he was a hopeless, arrogant, self-aggrandizing failure.  He absolutely sought to personally profit from his discoveries (fair enough) and used the natives with no regard for their humanity to those ends.  It is *possible* (maybe) that he was not as *personally* responsible for some of the atrocities committed by his expeditions as some make him out to be today, but it's plain that he just didn't care and in the best case turned a blind eye to what subordinates did.  In the worst, he was just a  monster.  

To be honest though, these characteristics were shared by many if not most European explorers of the era, with Vasco da Gama being a prime example.  He was even worse than Columbus.  European attitudes towards the rest of the world were especially fucked up in the 1400's and 1500's, for a variety of reasons, and took centuries to get better.   If you're interested in these things, the book *Conquerors:  How Portugal Forged the First Global Empire* is a great read."

I was working at a sushi restaurant in high school and was getting a raise of 25 cents a month and started at a dollar above the minimum wage. Rather than be happy for me, his response was that they will probably cap my salary eventually and that he has the harder job
* okay so I didn’t want to believe this was true at the time because he was so nice to me (or so I thought). But on multiple occasions he’s apparently told girls they were ugly and that no guy would want to sleep with them "
"I’m a dad of a little girl and I absolutely became much more of a feminist once my daughter was born. I knew a tiny bit about gender inequality but I’m much more aware of it now, and I try, like put in effort try to support women without acting like women need a man to save them. Oddly though my wife wants none of that towards her

To be fair, my wife is not now, nor has she ever been, lesser than me. I do make the monies, and if there are big decisions I tend to have final say. But that’s because my wife wants to be a stay at home mom and because I am more informed about the big decisions we make. But the wife runs the house and is more or less the boss of day to day life. She was raised in a house that was not just religious but restrictive, with clearly defined gender roles, and while that isn’t how our marriage works I have been told to stay the hell away from the kitchen, that’s the only man free zone she maintains. I hate doing dishes so....

I have a very unique situation in my marriage where I am a feminist and the wife is WAY against feminism. I know. I know. She voted for trump and STILL supports him I KNOW! I don’t get it either. But she married me so if I start helping her be less crazy there is no way she will continue to put up with me because I am a giant pain in the ass.

So for my bizzaro world it is beneficial to support my daughter 10,000% and ask my wife to make dinner. I feel bad about it, but my wife is so damn happy to be a homemaker, the smile she has on her face when she puts food in front of me is genuine and slightly weird.

My wife supports my daughter and encourages her to be assertive and dominant. I do too. My kid however wants to play with barbies so I have no idea. All I know is I show my girls love and support and make sure they know every day that they are my reason to get up in the morning.

"I was maid of honor at my best friend’s wedding. The one thing that annoyed me was all the festivities - we did an engagement party, destination bachelorette party where we each paid close to $1k, and bridal shower. We had professional makeup and hair done which was an additional $200, and our dresses were $200. I get that she’s only going to be married once, but damn that was a lot of money. 

She also did lots of things that I loved! We ordered our dresses online from Azazie which is relatively cheaper and we could pick our own styles but she set the color. She was appreciative of everything we did for her, and was very clear on what she wanted and didn’t want. She also pitched in $50 for each of us to get our makeup and hair done. Also gave each of us gifts too. She’s just such a caring person that I was willing to spend all that money on her. "

"a little less than a year ago I lost my most beloved kitty to cancer as well. it was terribly aggressive cancer. I tried many many many treatment options but none of them helped and at my second last trip to the vet, he told me that I could either keep trying different treatments and maybe give her another month or two at best. but they'd be hard on her as she was suffering and in a great deal of pain. and so it had reached the point where if I kept giving her treatment it would only be for for my own benefit, to be with her longer. but it wasn't helping her, it was only prolonging the inevitable. so I decided to book her last appointment for the very next day. and so I dealt with it by coming to terms with the fact that up until her last vet appointment I'd done everything in my power to help her, and I'd also given her the best life, and that she was well loved. and I took her home and buried her in my backyard, and now clovers grow over where she's buried (her name was Clover)"

&gt;-Legitimately said that he had trouble viewing women as anything but sex objects because he watched so much porn. 
&gt;

Hmmm sounds a bit serial-killery"
"Honestly, yes. And I think the proliferation of hardcore, rough internet porn has only made things worse but it's just one factor of many. 

A lot of men have the idea that sex is something that is done to women, not something that we do together. Many women don't know or explore their own bodies and are unable to get themselves off or tell a partner how to. a lot of men also assume that because another woman they were with enjoyed something, that all women enjoy it. 

The reason I mentioned porn is because for some guys around my age (early to mid 20s), they grew up watching porn that's rough, degrading, and unsatisfying for women. I mean, some women do like that kind of sex but part of the problem is that people are viewing porn as a ""how to""/instruction manual rather than just entertainment. I have noticed a significant difference between sex with men my age and older men who didn't have access to this kind of porn growing up. Though regardless of age, I can absolutely tell the difference between men who have consumed a lot of porn regularly and the ones who don't, and the ones who don't seem to be on the older side. "

"A little bit sexism, a little bit people expecting teenagers to know everything adults do and thus behave like adults do, and a good deal of moral panic.

Sad thing is that people think only men do this, or they think that when women do it it's in the form of saying the same things that men say.

But the most hate I've seen for teenage girls comes from older women who think they're helping them. They think by making fun of and calling Twilight stupid and wrong that they're helping young women know right from wrong, failing to realize that young girls are able to engage in fantasy without imitating it in real life or thinking fiction and reality are the same. 

Is Twilight dumb? I think so, yeah. Would I condone a relationship like that in real life? No. Is it hurting the girls who read it? No, not unless those girls already have problems that were likely to cause them trouble anyway. Source: I liked Twilight when I was a lonely 14 year old who just got dumped by her first boyfriend and enjoyed the fantasy of a guy who's obsessed with you because I was aware that fantasy is a safe way to explore those sorts of things, and that it would be a totally different matte in real life, and fantasizing never once harmed me.

So, idk. It takes a lot of forms but what I see most is older women doing it thinking that they're helping...but it doesn't help to make young women feel like something is wrong with them for exploring their sexuality through fantasies that don't necessarily match those of an adult woman who's taken Women's Studies college courses. 

And for the record, I categorize that as misogyny. It's just not what people think of when they usually hear the term."

"I am very easily irritated or angered and don't have very much patience. When I get irrationally annoyed or angry about something I remind myself that my feelings are just that - irrational - and that I most likely won't feel this same way as soon as I am distracted with something. I also remind myself that if I say or do something to give in to that emotion then I will most certainly regret it later, and that keeps any reactions I am inclined to have at the moment inside. Thankfully my boyfriend is extremely patient and rarely annoyed by anything, and also knows that I have trouble controlling my irrational feelings and gives me space. I have recently started doing small physical exercises to relieve quick spurts of anger, like holding my shoulders back for 10 second intervals and breathing deeply. I'm still working on it, but these little things have been surprisingly really helpful.  "

"The signs we use for ""men"" is the one we also generally use for ""humans"" (like in traffic lights for example). It's just a faceless person - two legs, two arms. The sign for ""women"" is ""human, but, like, other kind of human"".

Bathroom signs are the obvious example but you also see this in cartoons.

Normal raccoon = boy raccoon.  
Raccoon with long eyelashes = girl raccoon.

Normal weasel = boy weasel.  
Weasel with a bow = girl weasel.

"Talking like someone's sleep is causing a problem of some sort. My sleep quality was great until I was like 19-20 and I could do well after a sleepless night.

"&gt;  If I suggested in any way that I was unhappy, he would just giggle and tell me I was ""emotional"" so therefore couldn't have any reasoning or logic to how I felt. It led to a lot of invalidation of genuine issues. 

This. 

My ex-boyfriend prided himself on being logical - which is great when you're problem solving a computer issue. He grew up with one parent with mental illness and another who was completely stoic, and ""handled"" all of the emotions stemming from the mental illness. He learned that any emotions were irrational and that the only way to solve an issue that included any emotion was to shut down the conversation. That was a fun 3 years. "
"The small dating pool is definitely the most challenging thing for me. Plus women are generally more particular about who they date and seem more content to stay single until they meet someone who is really ideal for them - so it takes longer to find mutual attraction and compatibility. There is also the difficulty that some women are confused about their orientation and only looking to experiment. However, I would say that the majority of challenges I've had in my relationship with my partner (who is a woman) have not been related to having a same-sex relationship but just more general issues that could affect any couple."

"It can be harder to meet people and to feel like you have a normal relationship like heterosexuals get to due to people being in the closet and wanting to hide.  Less of a problem as I get older, though.

This complaint is controversial and unique to me, but I think sexual relationships, like hetero relationships, go too far in one direction.  With hetero relationships, you hear complaints that there aren't enough orgasms or sexual exploration outside of PIV (whether that is true or not, I can't say).  With lesbian relationships, there's an obsession with having multiple orgasms, long sessions, and being switches/equals in everything.  Sounds great at first, but I get exhausted too fast to really enjoy long sessions, and I'm also not comfortable receiving every sex act my partner wants to receive, which can make me feel pressured to do stuff I dislike for the sake of staying equal.  I don't know if I'd be happy with no orgasms or strict gender roles that are hetero complaints either, though.  I just want more middle ground. "

Yes that might mean I date another gender after you.

"This just happened to me! Except they said light blue, no length or style specificied.

The bride freaked out on me that I didn't know what light blue was, and that a dress should obviously be cut at the knee. 
We bridesmaids finally figured out her color scheme. We all together found dresses that were well priced and have matching fabric, in royal blue and are cut at the knee. Basically, the bride thought light blue meant lighter than navy, but my sky blue was not light blue. Same happened to the grooms who were told a grey suit. There are about 40 different shades of grey suits. Only one of them is acceptable. Wedding hasn't happened yet so I'm sure there is more to come."
"&gt; Erotica is straight-up porn

As a romance and erotica writer, I feel compelled to argue this point. There are different types of erotica as well. Short-form erotica is indistinguishable from porn, but there's long, plotty erotica which explores themes of sex and sexuality like any other genre explores their themes. I love writing about sex as a plot device and character development because I find sexuality and coming to terms with one's sexuality extremely interesting, but it may not even arouse me. Erotica can be literary, it's about one's sexual journey, not necessarily for a stroke."
My husband has told me his gums feel funny when I have my period. Wild.
"No,  It wasn't around when I was young.  HPV is the single most popular STD in the US.  It's basically as common as the flu (seriously, research it).  Though I've never had an outbreak, I carry the virus.  This gave me cervical cancer after I had been lax in receiving Pap smears.  I was only stage one, but because I had endometriosis I elected for a hysterectomy at age 28.  By age 32, the hysterectomy and other abdominal surgeries had caused such severe internal scar tissue that my ovaries were literally glued to my insides.  No one could figure out why I was in such immense pain.  They could see cysts, but they shouldn't have been causing the pain they were.  I had to have hip to hip surgery, eventually, to remove my ovaries and the scar tissue removed.  It was fucking painful.  Now, at 34 I'm basically post-menopausal and I have to take HRT to prevent me from being osteoporosis ridden by 40.

Just.  Vaccinate.  I'm vaccinating my son.  He won't carry it and spread it to others.

I'm a fucking PSA

edit: your ovaries have to be free to move about to do ovary type of things.  If they are unable to move, it's hours of severe pain pain on end... and you don't want to know what happens when your body is processing food and it's time to poop. "
Shit even as a lesbian if i heard her say that it'd be pretty awkward and a total mood killer.
"Not the funniest but the least informed: that women only get their periods once ever when they're young, then they never get another period for the rest of their lives, so if a woman says she's on her period, she must be underage. 

Also guys that think women can just hold it in. "

"This is so sad. My heart breaks for him. I saw a little boy fall off a climbing structure at the free mall play area and he was scared and a little hurt so he was crying and his father just kept telling him to “be a man, stop crying” and finally when he couldn’t stop sniffling he took him home because “you can’t stop crying”. Never once offering any words of sympathy or concern. My heart broke for that child that day also. 

The look on my daughters face when she watched the whole situation was pure empathy for the boy, I’m glad she is being raised by a man who values feelings and communication. "
"Man here. Pretty much exactly describes my upbringing (born in 1990), and probably that of most boys my age. From a very young age, we're shamed into not crying or showing any excess emotion by our parents, loved ones, and friends.

And yes, **“Are you a little girl?”** is often the exact phrase that is used. It also happens to be offensive to girls on a whole other level we can circle back to. 

Similarly, there's multiple times I've seen adult men try to show emotion (not even full on crying), and certain women will jokingly say **""Do you need a tampon?""**

It isn't too surprising that so many of us are terrible at expressing/dealing with our emotions in a healthy way. It's strongly discouraged growing up to even acknowledge that you have emotions."
"I find this odd. Chances are he's not asking your parents permission because he feels he needs permission or that you are property. Rather I believe the reason men ask permission is because a lot of older men still think it's respectful. In truth, when you marry, you gain more than a SO. You gain an entire family. Asking permission opens up a dialogue for the parents to raise concerns they may have regarding your intentions, your future, etc. 

I never asked my SOs parents, but I certainly can see it being important so long as it's not coming from a super traditional, women-are-possessions viewpoint.  "
"We have an entire weeks worth of moral boosting ""events"" every year. People will use their PTO and vacation day to actively avoid it. Most of the activities are in the morning and they are humiliating games that you have to put a happy face on for the higher ups. Stuff like who can eat a donut from a string the fastest and ""silly yoga"" in which you had to make funny faces while doing yoga poses. They try to get people to volunteer but no one does so they just pick people instead for the events. The entire thing is a cringe fest and everyone tries their best not to get picked or take those days off. "

"In my mid thirties I decided I wanted to go back to college. I was running a network at an engineering company and was getting pretty good with computers so I decided on a computer science degree. Unfortunately my husband was not supportive of this... said it was a waste of time and money, and threw down every obstacle he could find to prevent me from going. I managed to get the equivalent of my first year done, even though it took three years to do it. (Kids, work, home, asshole husband made it tough). Then in 2008, lost my job and decided I really needed to finish my degree somehow. Had the same obstacles, but this time I qualified for a $10,000 grant, kids were older and no job to take up my time. Went through a divorce, used my grant, and proceeds from selling my house to live on for two years, and finished my degree in 2013 after going full time. Now, I have a job that pays more than I could have ever imagined, I have the confidence and satisfaction of having accomplished this under difficult circumstances. My kids are proud of me, I have my own home, and best of all no asshole husband. Having support for your dreams means everything. "

"My best friend got married last year. I traveled to a different country for the wedding and went to her hometown. It’s a super small town, but I’d never been before. Anyways, I got there about a week or two before the wedding to help with last minute stuff. I wasn’t able to get there sooner because of work, but my friend was less than understanding. 

To say that this woman was the actual, literal, physical embodiment of Satan doesn’t even do it justice.

About an hour after I got to her town, she went off on me about how she’s been doing everything alone and no one helps her despite her whole family bending over backwards to help her with the planning, etc.

About a week or so after I arrived, I got sick. Like, Moctezuma had his whooooole revenge on me sick. I felt like I was dying and she made it a point to call me out whenever she could. A few days into the sickness, I slipped and fell down a marble staircase. I had to be bedridden for the next few days and my friend proceeded to kick me out of her house. 

So I was pretty much ill and homeless in a town I didn’t know, in a country I’d never visited. 

Why I didn’t just grab my shit and go home, I’ll never know, but her wedding went smoothly, I went to the airport right after the reception, and didn’t see her again for about another two months. She apologized and cried, but that shit was traumatic and I refuse to ever be a bridesmaid again. "

"I feel like I need to be twice as thin as a shorter woman so I don't appear big and masculine. It's very hard to look feminine when you're 5'10'' and big... Everywhere: Wrists, ankles, stomach, arms, etc. It could all be in my head, but shorter, bigger women can still appear sexy and feminine and cute and all of those things, but big *and* tall is just a nope. It hasn't worked out too bad for me because I've always maintained a lithe figure, probably as a result of not wanting to look like above description.

Clothes shopping is fine, but I do have to be careful about dresses and skirts - they can appear micro on me.

It's also hard to NOT stand out when you're this height. If I wear a nice office outfit it just looks like I'm screaming for attention, but if a shorter squatter woman were to wear the same thing it wouldn't. That's honestly the most frustrating part for me ."

Edit to add: I just don’t think I could look my friends in the face and ask them to pay for all that. "

"I don’t have a spa near me but I love lush stores and so does my husband! I bought him the twilight spray for his birthday and he sprays that on himself before bed and sometimes during the day.  It’s not the spray that’s marketed towards men, but goddamn, it’s the best scent there is! He also asked for the giant rose bath bomb for his birthday.

He is a pretty manly looking dude.  Beard and tattoos, works in a male dominated field. 

I feel bad for men who disregard lush because it’s “cosmetics”.  And I feel bad for the men who feel like they can’t shop at a place like that without being judged"
"I think it speaks a lot about a person when they do the ""what if she's lying"" thing.  Behavior he may be guilty of, or knows someone who has.  They're concern trolling, pretending to give a shit about the accused and using it as a cudgel against women who come forward with an accusation, especially if it's *later.*  Just another way to shit on women.  Men are 82,000 times more likely to be raped than accused of rape, but you don't see these losers defending or caring about men who are raped, do you."
I love how romance novelesque this all is.
"My kind of awful/kind of cool boss hired her idiot best friend who consistently fucked things up and then gave her a promotion and she fucked more things up. Both are impossible to address the constant fuck ups with, the friend because she's so dumb and doesn't get it, the boss always has excuses for her. Makes me wonder what kind of dirt the friend has on the boss, but both of them get inappropriately drunk at work events and boss was groping someone who was 20 years younger than her husband at a recent wedding, so I would guess something along those lines."

I didn't have a phone at the time and set my alarm so I could get a nap in before I met him for dinner.

He ended up severing all contact with me, which I completely understand.

That was 2011 and I still feel like shit about it. "
"The constant need to get attention from other women nearby. We could be at a bar having a really lovely night, and a group of ladies could be standing nearby (usually older, never younger), and he'd find some way to jump into their conversations, make them laugh, draw them in. But if some men talked to me, he'd get really shitty about it."
"She slapped and kicked him, at least 3 people saw it happening. What led to it is a mystery since both of them have very different versions.

"A girl a few years younger than me that I was travelling with got groped by a creepy older dude the other day (he groped me too, dunghead) and we were having a rant about it and how some men sucked and she just kept saying how annoyed she was but instantly following it with ""but I'm not a feminist! I'm not a feminist!""

It made me so sad.

A) you're allowed to be pissed off about the creepy old guy grabbing you innapropiately without consent and you don't have to be a feminist to think that's NOT OK.

And B) What's wrong with feminism? Equality for all and getting rid of this toxic masculinity etc mentioned in these threads from men and women. Also helping women not feel like they should apologise when someone creepy grabs them without permission and helping men not feel entitled to a women's body, because these are clearly still issues. "
"Not single anymore but I think a giant bowl of macaroni and cheese is pretty damn tasty.  The cheap kind from a box will do just fine.  A whole box...  Not the one serving portion either.  Even better is Velveeta shells &amp; cheese.  I could make myself sick on that stuff.

"There was some crossed wire for me when I was young and learned about periods, and I thought you got it once as well.

When my mom explained no, it was every month for the next 30-40 years, I had a complete melt down. I was eleven and could not handle that reality crashing down on me. "

"I'm a little late to the party but I can think of a few 

* Every time I succeeded at anything he would get upset. It didn't matter that we were in totally different fields, at different universities, in different cities, and I applied for everything possible while he applied for nothing, if I got a scholarship it was ""unfair."" 

* There was an expectation of emotional labour that was never equal. When I was sad, he would spend about 10 seconds pretending to comfort me and then would nope out. If he had any problem in his life, no matter how minor, he expected that I would figure out the solution, implement it and see it through, all while comforting him throughout. If I didn't fix it, it never got fixed. This ran the gambit of minor things (holes in his socks) to serious ones (refused to go to the hospital at his own initiative.)

* He had no respect for any of my interests, while simultaneously expecting me to love and partake in all of his. Every band I liked was ""bad,"" every hobby I had was ""stupid""  - even if he'd never interacted with them in any way - but he went on and on and on, constantly, incessantly, about ""why don't we have any common interests? It makes me *so sad* that we don't share any common interests!!""

When he finally revealed his misogyny it was like...a whole bunch of things clicking into place. Unfortunately it took a couple rounds of him being obvious about it before I broke up with him."
"I grew up with parents who had this dynamic that mom was always nagging everyone to help out so I thought that it was normal to have to beg a grown man to help clean up after himself.

Please get your sister to change her parenting- aside from being egregiously sexist, parenting like this is severely damaging "
"I'm not 100% sure if it counts: after a breakup with an ex who always asked for me to be more feminine, I completely changed my looks. I used to have butt-length hair, skirts and lacy tops. Now I have a buzzcut, mostly wear dress pants and t-shirts, polos or button-down shirts

It has definitely changed the way people see me. Catcalling stopped, people wouldn't sit too close and stare on public transport. Seems like I fell out of the conventional attractive scheme. 

Since I feel more comfortable now, I act calmer. Which helps me to get taken more serious in professional environments.  "

"Short answer: Misogyny. 

Long answer: I think a lot of the hate for teen girls and their culture is rooted in the kind of thinking that brought about ideas about female hysteria in the 19th and 20th century. That women, especially young women, can't control themselves or their emotions, that they get upset or excited for no real reason, that they're weak-minded and slavishly follow whatever trend is the hottest at the time. 

We, as a society, denigrate their interests because cultural misogyny is very strong and we don't take them seriously or think they're silly, which in many cases they are but that's fine, all teenagers are. "
"I've told my father several times over the years that if a guy I'm dating ever asks his permission to marry me, that he should say no, and then tell me.

I also really don't like the idea of my parents knowing before me."
"I deleted Facebook. I missed it for about a week, then forgot about it completely.

I don't miss it in the least.

If I want to talk to a friend, I call them. If I want to see how someone's been doing, we'll plan dinner. Period. 

I miss what Facebook was ten years ago. It actually fulfilled its function then of connecting friends and family in one easily accessible place. Now? Now it's just toxic nonsense interspersed with ad space."
Yeah I'm kind of ashamed to admit it but I was talking with my 4-year-old daughter about how many women shave their legs and armpits and told her that she shouldn't have to do it if she doesn't want to and immediately realized my hypocrisy - I would prefer my wife continue shaving her legs and pits. However if she stopped I'd respect her decision. Not my fuckin choice.

"&gt; A more equal relationship means more work for them and less control.

That this is considered a bad thing among so many men is profoundly sad to me. The simple knowledge that I get to share my life and my growth someone just as - if not more - driven, intelligent, and capable as me is by far the greatest joy I've experienced.

It's hard to even imagine the kind of repressed fragility that leads to men denying themselves this joy in order to avoid admitting weakness... but it sounds so, so sad."
