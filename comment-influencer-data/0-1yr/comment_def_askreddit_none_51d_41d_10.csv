It means your ATK is higher than your DEF.

Lol jk def Shrek"
Nurse here. They def exist
Your uncle def banged ur mom before he thought your mom was the one.
honestly? i really liked it which was surprising bc i’m a computer science major so i was expecting to do more tech stuff. once i got over the initial fear it was actually really helpful to build my confidence in talking to authority which i’ve always sucked at (if a teacher yells at me i cry. i’m baby). the guy i worked under was an exec and he would always gas me up about how good of a job i’m doing and that DEF helped. tl;dr i had a good time but idk if it’s something i can do full time
"Would I destroy myself and my owner lose Life Points equal to the difference between my ATK and DEF?

(I haven't actually played Yu-Gi-Oh in so long that I don't remember basic rules like these.)"
"I don't have ptsd but surviving an attempted murder by an extended family member with mental illness changed me. It took me a few years to find zen and reconnect with positive atitudes and such. But now I'm what some people might describe as morbid. Not necessarily bitter and cynical, cause it's too painful for me and others to indulge in that behavior, but really kind of serious. I'm harder to make laugh and I don't have the energy to fake it. This def makes it difficult to connect with people, people don't like not having their jokes and wit laughed at, even when I'm moved to simply smile on the inside. I'd call it the Eeyore effect but I don't think that reapects the level of effort I make to not bring others down, eeyore kinda indulges himself. I can tank a room though if I'm off guard."
