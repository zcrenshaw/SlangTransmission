A little discomfort is a small price to pay for maintaining our status as patriarchal oppressors keeping you in utter subjugation.
"A lot of the time, yeah, we're just dying. Especially when its 120 degrees on the subway platform and the subway is still 10 min away. "
"Just move dude, you don’t have to feign an existential crisis and get support for your wants. New York isn’t for you, at once it was fun and exciting and new and now you’re realizing it’s not your bag, that’s totally fine. People move out of the city, pursuing happiness isn’t a monumental decision, it’s the decision you’re *supposed* to make. It’s not a breakup, it’s not a battle, people like to wax poetic about leaving but if there’s nothing keeping you here then that’s all you need to know."
"He’s full of shit. Uber drivers aren’t subject to the regulations put on taxi drivers, and taxi drivers go to NJ all the time - how do you think people take them to Newark airport?

He probably didn’t want to go because then he’d be stuck in NJ picking people up."

I'm very close to deciding to leave. For me its being disabled. Getting around the city is very difficult. 
definitely secretly dying. even just dressing business casual is awful but the additional of the jacket and tie makes it so much worse. what I don't get is when I see women wearing short dresses in the dead of winter. i'm not sure which is worse.
"&gt; Especially when its 120 degrees on the subway platform and the subway is still 10 min away.

I can feel the rivers of sweat dripping back just thinking about it.

"Absolutely can be done. You're going to spend some money on cabs. You'll want to figure out restaurants ahead of time so you're not wandering looking for a suitable place. You also might not want to do a weekend, or maybe have most of the trip fall during the week. The tourist load might be a little lower. 

I would definitely pick a hotel with a nice cafe downstairs. It will give you a place to regroup and refresh in the late afternoon before heading back out, and this way if anyone wants to take a short nap the rest of the family will be close by.

I'd really plan just one big event per day. Would they enjoy an art museum? With some planning you can work out a ""greatest hits"" tour of either MoMA or the Met. All museums have wheelchairs available for guest use. They're big places and a lot of walking is required. I don't know if your budget will stretch to this, but you could even arrange a private tour. 

""Come From Away"" is highly regarded and I'm sure your family will enjoy seeing it. 

As you formulate your itinerary, please post and we can make specific restaurant and other suggestions that minimize walking and maximize the experience. 

You're so great to do this for your parents! "
Cuomo seems really excited to run against Trump in 2020.
"Interesting that you post this today, August 28th!

Local Law 147/2017, passed by DiBlasio, requires buildings to draft, adopt, and distribute their smoking policies by today.  Check yours, it may explicitly cover this situation.  Google ""local law 147/2017"" for some decent summaries.

Other than that I would check your by-laws.  In general, smoking in one's own apartment is ok and the other tenant is well within his rights to do so.  However it may be on the building itself to figure out how to remedy the situation regarding the ventilation if its somehow affecting the unit's habitability.

Maybe crosspost this onto r/legaladvice?

311 is always a helpful option too."
"Pay with every order. Tip at least $1 per drink. If you want to pay at the end of the night ask the bartender to open a tab and give them any credit card (it doesn’t have to be what you will actually pay with). When it’s time to close your tab at the end of the night tell them you’re ready to close your tab but you want to pay with cash (or a different card or 5 cards or whatever).

Pro tip:  Become a regular, pay cash, and tip well - you should start getting some buybacks. When you get a free drink or round you should still tip, in fact you should tip extra. I tip about half of what I would have paid but I use round numbers and don’t make a big deal about it.  Do this and you’ll get a lot more free drinks. "
"Who is Cuomo running against? If he is running against Trump, then I guess he won?  

But for real, he sucked, he floundered and came across as dismissive and rude.  Calling Nixon as corrupt as the Koch’s and Trump!? What the fuck is that.

Nixon has plans for the state that aren’t just “well I will look into it” and “well the republicans don’t let me do it” so she won.
"
"I'm extremely biased, but I felt that Nixon exceeded expectations.  Though I think it's a red herring I can somewhat understand why people would be hesitant to support her based on her lack of experience.  I simply cannot understand how anyone in their right mind could actually *support* Cuomo given literally any other option.  He personifies everything that is wrong with NY politics."

"New York sure ain’t perfect, but where else is there to go? Everywhere else will feel like a boring letdown after this. "
"I’ve been back for a year after 4 years in LA. I was super ready to leave NYC at the time but I started to miss it more and more. For me, it was the accessibility and culture that I missed the most. Concerts, plays, art, etc ., is unparalleled. 
In LA, the traffic brought me to near-tears so many times and when I’d finally find street parking, I’d never want to leave to go out or go to the gym for fear of losing my spot so I spent way too much time at home. Sure, it’s sunny every day but that also got super weird because the seasons don’t exist and time kind of warps. It’s also an extremely isolating place because no one wants to drive an hour across town to hang out after commuting all day so if your friends aren’t around the corner, good luck. Not the case in NYC. I hate a lot of things about being back here, but sitting in traffic for hours upon hours every. single. day. is a special kind of hell. At least the subway delays are varied and exciting every day! 
I had a job offer and thought long and hard about moving back to LA this year, especially after the dreadful winter, but there’s something about this place that keeps me coming back for more. LA just felt like it paled in comparison in so many ways. Just my two cents. "
"She might win the NYC vote, no way she wins the state as a whole."
"fuck, i really don't want him to."
"Co-ops love rules, and there's no reason they'll make an exception for you. However, I would suggest that every time you head to the gym and the guard is not there, call the management office, tell them you're not able to get in, and that you'll wait on the line until the security guard comes back. No reason to be rude or mean, just be matter of fact and persistent."
"You know the stereotype of the slow Southerner?  It works.  Walk about 2/3 as fast as you normally would.  You generate a lot less heat.

"I eat out 90% for about 9 months of the year. I don’t feel *bad* for those 9 months. But in the other 3, I **actively** feel *good*. If that makes sense

"3 is my max now. I used to live in a 5th floor walk up and it was SHITTY I’m not out of shape but it fucking sucks. 

1.) Getting home drunk sucks.

2.) Having to meet the seamless guy half way because you feel bad while also tipping extra because you feel bad sucks.

3.) Doing laundry on the first floor, where the machines usually are, sucks. 

4.) Bringing up more than one amazon package sucks. Or even one if you also have a work bag / laptop / whatever.

5.) Grocery shopping sucks. Tipping extra for grocery delivery here too.

6.) When it’s hot and humid and there’s no AC in the halls (or air circulation) sucks.

7.)Wearing heels sucks, unless you bring an extra pair just for the stairs or go barefoot which is gross.

8.) Hearing your friends ask “how do you do this every day” every time they’re over also sucks.

Do not recommend. "
"Sure, gay marriage was passed under his tenure, but a similar bill nearly passed in 2009 and the Overton window had sufficiently shifted by 2011 (especially in a progressive state like NY).  In 2018, every single Democratic candidate for statewide office is going to be a vigorous supporter of gay rights (especially Nixon).

As far as bad things Cuomo has done:

*  If you listened to the debate tonight, he constantly blamed everything on the republican-controlled senate; he was instrumental in putting it together.  He     [signed off on a heavily gerrymandered redistricting plan](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-York-Redistricting-Cuomo-Legislature-Proposal-Deal-142723995.html) which gave the Republicans an artificial majority in the state senate despite a 2:1 registration advantage for Democrats (after promising that he would veto any maps that weren't drawn by an independent commision).

* Provided tacit support for the senate's [IDC](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/nyregion/idc-new-york-senate-cuomo-democrats.html?_r=0), a rogue group of democrats that decided to caucus with Senate republicans in exchange for inflated salaries.  He claimed to be powerless to stop them, but they were [dissolved](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/nyregion/new-york-democrats-idc-future.html) shortly after Nixon announced her primary challenge.  

* Disbanded the [Moreland Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreland_Commission_to_Investigate_Public_Corruption) after it [became clear that he might be implicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/nyregion/governor-andrew-cuomo-and-the-short-life-of-the-moreland-commission.html).

* He has essentially zero grassroots support ([0.2%](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/nyregion/cuomo-fundraising-election.html?&amp;moduleDetail=section-news-1&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&amp;region=Footer&amp;module=MoreInSection&amp;version=WhatsNext&amp;contentID=WhatsNext&amp;pgtype=article) of his donations are less than $200) and this includes his staffer that made [69 donations of less than $10](https://nypost.com/2018/07/17/cuomo-donor-made-69-tiny-donations-to-campaign/).

* In an attempt to win the upstate vote he spent [$15 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/nyregion/new-york-film-hub-sale.html) on a film studio in Syracuse that later sold for $1.

There are many, many, more areas that I didn't scratch the surface of, but hopefully this provides you with a good starting point. "
this will be the first question that expensive lawyer is going to ask you.
"&gt; What's your story?

I grew up on Long Island. I never imagined moving to the city. I got married. My wife and I moved farther out on the island (north shore, western suffolk). We assumed we'd have kids (got married young) and later realized we didn't want them. My wife wanted to try living in the city. I objected, but was ultimately convinced to give it a try (2 hr each way commute is very convincing).

So, we rented a small apt for a while near both of our work places. We hated the weekend pack up everything commute out to the island. We tried some weekends in the city and decided we liked it. Then we had to pick a neighborhood. UWS won for our tastes. We love Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History.

That was 1993.

Nothing has felt like home ever since. We did live in Hoboken for a little while (7 years feels like a little while at our age) because it allowed earlier retirement. When we were able to move back, we did. Now we're back on the UWS and again, it just feels like home.

Everything about it.

Walkability to all of Manhattan (given enough time, Hoboken always required a train ride first). Close groceries, AMNH, Central Park, theater, restaurants, etc., etc., etc."

"In 9th grade, the majority of the grade does not know each other, so you really shouldn't worry much about him standing out. Since you mentioned he's very social, make sure he keeps it up and makes a few close friends early on.. people he can ask for help with homework or classwork. Maybe later in the year, encourage him to join clubs to develop his other interests? That's how a lot of close friendships are made. Even with sophomores/juniors/seniors.

Highschool is a time when children start to become independent, so as much as it sucks to watch it happen as a parent, you should definitely encourage him to hang out with friends as long as you're comfortable with his friends and where he's going. NYC is great for high schoolers because unlike other towns, you don't need a car to get to hang out. "
"rent a room instead of an apartment at least for a month. They're much quicker to find something than an apartment. While you're living there, pursue the search for an apartment full time. It's an upgrade over your current situation and it'd give you some time to not rush your yearlong apartment lease situation. Rushing could put you in some sketchy and risky situations."

"Entertaining!  Cuomo was pragmatic with a hint of standard New-York-old-boys-club and obviously positioning himself for 2020 or 2024. Nixon came across idealistic but naive about Albany, especially wanting to double the state budget and thinking the Governor alone can fix the MTA's woes.

Best part was when neither wanted de Blasio's endorsement."
