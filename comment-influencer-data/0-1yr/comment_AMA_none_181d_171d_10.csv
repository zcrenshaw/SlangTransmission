I do believe I‚Äôve been properly instructed on its use
I wasn't thinking of a visual meme. It just seems to be a fitting name.
It wasn't.
So if I apply you are sending pics with 10 random guys? 
"I imagine it was pretty cool.

Did your life change drastically after the experience?

I have this romantic idea about being a monk, that it would be a life changing experience because you'd get to learn to be relax and more chill about life."
I know the Chad meme but how is breaking my wrist trying to do a backflip make me a chad
"Look I'm sure people would love to believe I read a load of research papers and did great research. Truth is I just slowly realized it was bull but i was happy to still put it off to ""some day I'll do it"". But yeah it was more that while I was willing to take the chance myself, now that I'm looking to have a baby, I couldn't take the chance of getting measles during &amp; hurting them"
"You‚Äôre fantastic.

If you wanna join this shoot me a pm with an email address where I can send updates.

If you‚Äôre too busy I will understand."
"I lived with the monks for a measly 4months, and it was in the Solukhumbu region of Nepal.

And yes it was Tibetan Buddhism, it was following the Gelug tradition, but I don't remember the exact specifics. The now deceased teacher of the Dalai Lama had established his monastery after fleeing Tibet only an hours trek away from where I was staying. 

I ended up participating in some important initiation ceremony held by a high ranking lama at that monastery with the group of monks I was staying with, so I'm fairly certain it's Gelug tradition. "
How are you talking to us from beyond the grave? 
"Did you ever get ""academic help"" from your family connections?"
Does it have to be 'deep' in the Himalayas?
"I don't know much about Gelug Buddhism; is it part of the Theravada, Mahayana, or Vajrayana school of thought? What would be its defining characteristic?"
Did you have access to the internet?
Did you do much traveling before this and were you nervous about going on your own? 
Say ‚Äúno‚Äù
I bet it‚Äôs not easy for him or the rest of your family huh? 
"Very good, have fun and stay safe, friend! "
But he don‚Äôt know that 
"That's amazing! I only ever see pictures of the traditional male monks, so I always wondered if women were allowed similar opportunity! Thank you for sharing! "
"Did you see any fat/obese people there in the nude?

How long did you work there for?

Did the place smell or did certain areas smell?

Would you go topless or nude if you got a chance to work a there again but this time you take a job that allows nudity?

Did your parents have a thing to say about you working there?"
"It makes sense though. Biological males are usually noticeably hairier than most females, and so most of society strongly associates a hairy body with being a man, and light amounts of body hair as ""feminine"", which is usually not how trans men want to be perceived. 

The few men who shave their legs or armpits get a lot of mockery and weird looks, especially if they're heterosexual, and women who don't shave are ostracized, and even told they're disgusting. Society has a weird obsession with other people's hair. "
"Chicfila is a deeply religious organization and this is reflected in every aspect of their business. I grew up in the Christian south and this doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all. I support the LGBTQ+ community and I worked with several gay people at that Chicfila. Religion isn‚Äôt forced down the throats of either customers or employees, but it‚Äôs very present within CFA culture. "
"UPDATE: Well... eight hours, several dozen questions and no (???) upvotes, seems like we're done here! Feel free to keep asking ‚Äî I'll check this once in a while. 

Thank you so much to everyone for being so nice!"
What does your boss do to you?
"What's that app? I've never heard of it before.

How old are you?

How long have you been using that app and doing AMA's for on the app?

What's the cringest things someone's asked on the app? 

Do you get asked vulgar or sexual questions? If so do you answer?

What made you decide to do AMA's?

How many times a day do people ask you out on the app?"
That's reassuring.
"I tried mescaline for the first time because I was going through a really rough time in my life mentally, and I read that it could help me work through that. It did. No physical lasting effects that I notice, but mentally I'm a much more spiritual and open-minded person now. "
"Monks seek community, the inherent value of the teaching of the Buddha is found in the three jewels which are the Sangha(community),Buddha(teachings), and Dharma(truth).

In that itself, I think monks find encouragement through their community, which I find to be one of the most important parts of reality. 

I don't think mental disorders are viewed too heavily in Buddhism as the attempted goal is to obtain control over the mind so that you can guide it and use it properly. 

I don't think there would be a harsh view towards mental disorders, but I think it's a hard mesh with Buddhism since the concepts are diametrically opposed. Buddhists kind of believe that you can control the mind since you are the master of your body. Mental Disorders inherently suggest a lack of control over the mind, so I would imagine that they wouldn't believe in using medication as treatment. HOWEVER. I don't actually know. The topic extends into a field that I'm sure high lamas might debate over themselves."
"As an English teacher myself, how do you go about doing this? I've seen it advertised but you had to pay to do it - fuck that shit. "
"Honestly need more work in this department than the eye contact üòÜ 

You ever use a line on a guy?"
Did you ever have any bad trips or experiences on LSD?
I‚Äôm doing good! Three classes left and I‚Äôm trying to push through. Which school are you at? 
do you were parfume anyway? if so how do you choose it?
Do you miss your male part? For lack of better words. 
Did you ever discuss sky death ritual with monks? I imagine this was a taboo subject and likely not talked about casually. Did the subject ever come up either from curiosity or concern? 
Do they allow women to become monks or study with them?
Shiver? Eek wouldn't want that. I worry I stare too long in the eyes and become offputting
"I just getting started.

I did take custody of my brother when I was in my early twenties so I think that countsüòä"
"Rather small, just not any venues in our town! Phoenix has plenty, but Gilbert has a focus on country and rap. Same thing with Mill Ave in Tempe."
Yes. They made some girls pee on each other. Spit on each other. Hazing wasn‚Äôt too terrible for me but I did get constantly mocked for my accent and the worse thing was getting drunk and felt up by frat guys. 
Sonics are in service constantly 
I mean we live in a society. I would be shocked if you didn't hate yourself
"I can chime in on my tradition at least (Vietnamese Thien).

First, you have to make a formal request from your teacher that you intend to go forth, with a letter of intent. If accepted, you are ordained in the Five Precepts as an aspirant, and this training period typically lasts six months to a year.

After that, you write another letter of intent to become a novice, and if accepted, you are ordained under the ten precepts, shave your head, and are given novice robes.

The training for the novice period in my tradition is typically around five years. After this, if the master deems you are ready, you begin the process for full ordination with 250 vows for monks and 348 vows for nuns. This is point where you are considered a monk or nun proper.

The training typically goes on under the master's tutelage for another five years, at which point a monk or nun disciple is allowed to take on lay disciples, teach to the community, and ordain laity under the Five Precepts. It can take even longer to be permitted to teach dharma overall, or take monastic disciples. And, obviously, the transmission of the lamp (confirmation of awakening) can take ages more, or not at all within one lifetime."
Did you take payment in the form of heroin or cash more often? Which payment did you prefer if so? Were repeat customers common? 
"Hate to break it to you, but anyone in charge isn't interested in people who post anti-US stuff to Facebook."
What‚Äôs your favourite book?
Try Pegging 
"haha thank you, but it's okay. i just thought it was funny!"
Nope still don't think I could have done it and not had a nag in my mind.  
"Is it coming out smooth, or crunchy?"
"Why, and do you think it had a lasting effect?"
"How much did you party?

Did you sleep around a lot? If so how many different partners have you had?

Have you had any girl on girl experiences? 

Was your specific sorority or at least some of the members known to be slutty? 

What were the benefits of being a member? 

Were there a lot of different cliques within your sorority?

Did your sorority bully other people within or outside the sorority? 

Did your sorority ever do anything bad enough to have to be disciplined by the school? 

Did you have fun? Do you regret it?

Did you guys play pranks on each other or pranks on other people?

How hard was it to join? What was the joining process like?

Who did you dislike/hate  the most within the sorority and why? Your answer can include multiple people as well.

Was the dorm you stayed at messy? Did everyone one have to keep it clean or did that job go to the newbies?

Are you still friends with the people you met in the sorority? 

Did you get into any heated arguments with any of the girls there? If not did anyone else? 

Did you do any drug's? If so what drug's and how was it the first time doing them? 

"
"Was there anything surprising about monk lifestyle you encountered? (Atypical from what is portrayed in movies and whatnot)

Was there much joking around/humor? Or is it more solemn and serious?"
"To be honest I don't care about the others around me exactly, I see vaccinating my kids as a purely selfish choice, I don't want them to get sick"
"Good luck, I hope things come out okay.

And I hope things came out okay."
"To my knowledge it depends (Not OP). There were a couple rinpoche in the US who made ample use of drugs, citing the ‚Äúinnumerable paths‚Äù clause from the Lotus Sutra, but I think the consensus that the ‚Äúwiser thoughts‚Äù you get from those drugs are artificial."
excuse me there are 70 other genders.
Well I think caden is a fitting name
HAD ME DYING AT WORK üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
How much weight can you hang from your festivals while meditating?  I only ask because I've seen videos of monks doing splits while hanging stuff from their junk.
"One would hope that they would be, but that hasn‚Äôt been our experience.  They should be trained on childhood trauma and how their decisions impact these children.  Splitting up families, sending kids back to their birth family in a certain order, and placing post foster care all needs work and shouldn‚Äôt be arbitrary.  New fresh out of college social workers should not be handling complex cases with little experience and no real life experience with kids.  "
"Did you work through an organization? If so, which? Would you recommend the experience to others? I'm so jealous."
I was diagnosed a few years ago as an adult. However it‚Äôs always been something I‚Äôve had I just didn‚Äôt know it until a few years ago. I just thought I was crazy 
Thanks 
Did Ace Ventura ever show up and ask for the knife?
I understand people are curious about this but man do I hate this question. It‚Äôs not about weight.. 
"That should absolutly be a disney channel original :D
"
lmao this is fun
Will you answer more than one question?
"That‚Äôs fantastic.

No link yet but I‚Äôll shout you my email so you can send me yours and stay updated."
Ah in out state there‚Äôs no casa At least not where I live so it‚Äôs a bit different I think.
Did you just switch to Ethernet cables?  Or are you saying that you haven't got a dedicated internet connection in your home with the exception of your sell phone's data connection?
"No, they seemed pretty strict about not drinking, however it is commonly within their precepts(monkly vows) not to drink. As for any other substances, it didn't look like it. 

I did have an opportunity while I was solo traveling with one of the lamas to discuss eating meat, after he was offered it. They will often reject eating meat just out of sheer principle of valuing life itself. However there are occasions where they will eat it, but it has to have specific assumptive knowledge behind it; such as they cannot see the animal being killed, cannot hear it being killed, it was not killed for their sake. If taking a life can be avoided it  should be avoided, is what was promoted to me. So the lama I was with simply rejected the meat, when I was with him, but it was offered.

Also, Tibetan monks live in a harsh climate and will eat meat due to the lack of vegetation in their area. Though I've never seen it, I read about it in a book at the monastery, so take it as you will."
"In the moment I actually thought I had been tazzed.  It didn't hurt at all, maybe the adrenaline?  What was worse was when they dragged me across the road for 150f or so."
"I know. I tell myself that same thing almost everyday, but I just can't get myself to break up with him. I'm a complete disgrace. "
Make me one with everything. 
"There's a lot of good parts in our relationship, I guess. I can't imagine my life without him. He's my whole world. "
"You're not the disgrace here. He's doing it to you, which caused this whole mess. You are just a victim, and you have nothing to be shamed about"
"Do you keep your fat fetish a secret or are you relatively open about it in your real life?

"I do not reach orgasm when with a client, as I only orgasm with my partner. I don‚Äôt have a hatred for anything a client does, at the end of the day, they are paying me for my time with them. One thing I don‚Äôt like clients doing is trying to overstep the clear boundaries I set, though I‚Äôm sure I speak for most other sex workers when I say this is one of my pet peeves! "

"Haven't heard of em and it's good that they get better because you're happy to see them and that's all that matters 

And it's good that you're making friends

What prompted traveling/teaching English to remote types?
Yeah that is on my mind a lot but I would not make them fatter unless thay wanted that I guess it's like a drug dealer thing if not me then another would do it 
Sex isn't the same as gender. A straight man can date a trans woman and still be considered straight because she's still a woman regardless of her genitalia.
"Yes, native level Korean.

Well, the Korean culture is pretty open. For example, kids in HS have no problem hugging other dudes or acting ""gay"". No REAL gay things, but theres people fooling around pretending to hump others (haha yeah pretty gay) However, while I was in there they stopped selling baby oil in the commissary because a lot of juvies were known to prey on the weaker juvies.

Naive ass me tried to refrain from contacting my mother for as long as possible, I lasted about 3 days before I contacted her.

About 4 times. Quietly in the bathroom.

A few, US military dude that raped young Korean girls, other foreigners in there for drug charges, a Pinoy trafficking bullets... Less than 10 foreigners total."

What was your last meal?
Most people wouldn‚Äôt believe it but labour/dredging. I studied the job market and found the best place in Canada to go to for someone without any college or university experience and I was gone. 
What kind of job? 
Is admission due to re-balancing needs? Do you become immune to the psychotropics prescribed?
We don‚Äôt really use WhatsApp here. We use Messenger. But no one texted me unfortunately :(
"I don't like them banning any animal for any reason. But it's not like it hasn't happened before. Bulldogs used to take down actual bulls. Then the bloodsport got banned. And no one cared about them. Then they got bred out of their natural form to be more cute or friendly (I know like alot about bulldog. Sorry)  

I just hate the rap they get. All dogs can be mean. All can be nice. It's how you raise them. And I think its horrible to let that dictate the future of a breed yknow. I just think more people need to be educated on them and train them better. When it boils down to it. Dogs were wolves at one point. They all have that fighting sense. But domesticated dogs also just have a primal need to be loved. For a companion. So it's just all in the training to find that balance I feel like."
"I mean did an of your friends texted you overnight and what did they say?

How fo you know the 14 seconds?"
"Do you consider the set of beliefs and theology in which buddhism arose is erroneous and only their philosophy of how to live is worth investigating, or do you think the belief in reincarnation and such are essential and inseperable from buddhism?"
also you have to be like Kevin Hart big for something like that to happen to you.
Doing it that way means that in fact some of the leftover meat was prepared specifically for them. 
Right on.  Good luck to you.   Thanks for answering.   Hopefully I'll catch your stand up sometime.

He's just answering some questions you colossal asshat. 
i think it's a bit like english and scottish english. they sound so fucking different 
"I lived in these areas for about 6 years, and written a book on Tibetan buddhism, and speak Hindi.  I appreciate that OP wants to share his experience at the monastery. That said, it's really really hard to consider yourself an expert in such a short time.  ""Ingee"" means ""westerner""---and there are a whole lot of ingees who go into Tibet and come out experts. Now, to his credit OP is a lot better than most of those folks. He's reasonably humble about his accomplishments.  But I wouldn't say that he knows a lot about Tibetan buddhism. "

It is risky but exciting. I am 24. I don't think it will since we are both hijabi girls who just have a bit of fun online.
"Not on purpose, but it does happen."
"Nope, housekeeping isn‚Äôt really the kind of job where that would be smart or comfortable to do (we had to clean toilets, take out trash, change peoples bedsheets/bring clean towels, etc) but some of the other staff could work topless or naked. I was sort of curious about what it would be like, though."
"Yea, that makes sense. I sort of think of life like a RPG visual novel. Interactions have a few choices and even in games there is benefit to picking the choice you don't like because it gets you farther in the game and in better position with the character. 

There is no benefit to me abusing her, it would just destroy the relationship. Could I have *fun* with some random person who doesn't mean anything to me? Sure, but that isn't the case with her."

&gt;Crash course.. not something to say on a plane

Not that well, but I felt I didnt have to. I did use some apps and got a pocket handbook, so I just practiced basic communications, manners, and anything related to food/numbers/travel/safety &amp; hospitals.  Munich might be on of the more English friendly areas, which is why I went there. All of the hotel staff spoke English and many restaurants and automated terminals had English (as well as French, Italian, and Spanish) accommodations."

---------|----------|----------|
Did the monks drink, or use any mood altering substances? I know in Laos there are Buddhist monks they call"" mountain men"" who use opium. Also would they eat whatever meal was offered to them? I only ask because I thought all Buddhist monks were vegan/vegetarian but learned that some will eat meat.|No, they seemed pretty strict about not drinking, however it is commonly within their precepts(monkly vows) not to drink. As for any other substances, it didn't look like it.  I did have an opportunity while I was solo traveling with one of the lamas to discuss eating meat, after he was offered it. They will often reject eating meat just out of sheer principle of valuing life itself. However there are occasions where they will eat it, but it has to have specific assumptive knowledge behind it; such as they cannot see the animal being killed, cannot hear it being killed, it was not killed for their sake. If taking a life can be avoided it  should be avoided, is what was promoted to me. So the lama I was with simply rejected the meat, when I was with him, but it was offered.  Also, Tibetan monks live in a harsh climate and will eat meat due to the lack of vegetation in their area. Though I've never seen it, I read about it in a book at the monastery, so take it as you will.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eigh9pb/)
Do you think the things you have learned there help you in someway during your day to day life?|Oh for sure! I think about a ton of the conversations I would have with the Rinpoche of the monastery daily. He offered me a lot of insight that I didn't realize at the time because I was so caught up in my own ego while I was there.  One time when I was overtly expressing joy and happiness he told me not to get too happy(expressed differently). And I was really confused, only until I kept up with my own studies did I understand what he was telling me was don't get attached to happiness because it is fleeting.  But yeah I definitely gained a ton of benefit and insight from my stay there.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eighyh9/)
How long have you been meditating? What is your routine in regards to meditation? Do you use any mood altering substances yourself? Do you go back to visit? Would you ever consider staying? Why did you go in the first place?  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry for all the questions but you're just the man I was hoping would do an AMA!|I've been meditating for only really 5-6years myself. I didn't get deep into Buddhism until I had an experience when I was traveling China and visited a Buddhist island there. The experience kind of stuck with me and then in my own expanse of character I fell more into studying Buddhism. I do smoke weed but mostly for meditation purposes. I do a lot of deeper meditation which focuses on understanding questions pertaining to my sense of self, and work to rid myself of the attachments I find connected through that. I plan on visiting next year, I keep in good contact with a lot of the monks and left a jacket there because I didn't have the space with me when I left.  The Rinpoche and I are fairly close and it feels like a home to me, so I would definitely consider staying if I ever decided to fully become a monk.  I went in the first place because I have always wanted to live with monks and see what it was like, and because as I delved deeper into Buddhism I felt a calling to experience it directly first hand.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eigj8qz/)
Where the monks all native to the area, or did they take international visitors on as monks/acolytes? Were there other service-oriented ""staff"" that did work without being monks? How open was the facility to visitors and tourists?|So, all the monks at my monastery were more local region monks, but it was more of a school for the younger monks. As such there were less older monks and the studies were more specific as to provide certain knowledge to these young monks so they could continue with Buddhism. Most of the monks won't stay at that monastery their entire life and will be traveling to different monasteries/areas to learn different things.  However I did come across a foreigner who was a fully practicing monk with another monastery. So I know that it does happen. There was other service-oriented ""staff"", primarily just a Chef who also taught the monks how to cook, and a few lay hands for help with the farming, they end up living at the monastery part time and they themselves are Buddhist, just not practicing monks.  The monastery was somewhat open to tourists and visitors. Not at letting them stay overnight without good reason, but at hosting them for lunch/allowing them to participate in the puja's. They did have visitors who stayed overnight and stuff.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eigj54d/)
What did you missed the most while you were there?|Honestly? I didn't bring a thermos or a cup with me, and the water supply was from a natural river or something, and would need to be boiled before I could drink it. So, I would have to borrow a mug, and I would feel guilty keeping the mug in my room for too long. So for my entire duration that I stayed there I had only consumed hot beverages.  Outside of cold beverages, I think the thing I missed most was casual conversation that wasn't through a language barrier.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eigk67a/)
What type of schedule &amp; activities would your average day consist of?|I was mostly just an English teacher. Sunday-Friday I taught 4 groups of 20 students each consisting of various ages ranging from like 6-22years old. Each group were at different levels but all of them varied heavily in their knowledge of English.  I would wake up at 6:00AM, eat breakfast with the lamas at 7-7:30AM, relax til 8:00AM, teach three 1hr long classes until 11:00AM, eat lunch til 12:00PM, then I would get my own break to conduct my own studies which I usually spent in the library until 4:30, then I would teach my advanced class and call it a day until dinner which I would again eat with the lamas at 7:00PM. I would spend most of my freetime engaging in conversation with the lamas or monks, and ended up forming a lot of bonds with many of them.  There would be three different puja's which are little prayer/meditation things done by the elder monks across the day at 5AM, sometime around 1:00-2:00PM, and then again at like 6:00PM~7:00PM. I mostly only did the night ones.  On Fridays at 9:00PM til 11:00PM the monks were allowed to watch TV, which they have a satellite for. Outside of that they are allowed their own personal items but they're not really suppose to engage in using technology. A few of the older monks aged 20+ would commonly pull out their cell phones when we were chilling in their rooms, but I was told that they would get confiscated if the lamas saw them playing with it.  And then Saturdays were a freeday mostly and outside of chores and certain other smaller tasks, the monks would play football(soccer) with a small little field. I would either play football with them or study, or just go on a small hike around the area.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eiggxlf/)
Was this a paid gig? Were they actively seeking an English teacher or was this some kind of tourism or hiking expedition that morphed into an ESL gig?|No it wasn't a paid gig, it was volunteer work through an organization. The monastery itself was actively seeking an English teacher, however there were a few monasteries that worked with the same organization.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eigjz4y/)
What type of Buddhism ?|Tibetan, Gelug tradition.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eighy80/)
How long were you there?  Where in the Himalayas?  I'm guessing this was Tibetan Buddhism? What tradition?  &amp;#x200B;|I lived with the monks for a measly 4months, and it was in the Solukhumbu region of Nepal.  And yes it was Tibetan Buddhism, it was following the Gelug tradition, but I don't remember the exact specifics. The now deceased teacher of the Dalai Lama had established his monastery after fleeing Tibet only an hours trek away from where I was staying.  I ended up participating in some important initiation ceremony held by a high ranking lama at that monastery with the group of monks I was staying with, so I'm fairly certain it's Gelug tradition.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eigh7dm/)
Are you we?|We are you?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eigo8rc/)
Are you bald ?|No actually I was growing out my hair while I was there. I have long hair currently. Some monks are allowed to grow their hair from what I understood. Not sure the specifics though. I think it had something to do with different set of precepts.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/b0quhm/i_have_lived_and_taught_at_a_buddhist_monastery/eigrhsf/)

I plan on visiting next year, I keep in good contact with a lot of the monks and left a jacket there because I didn't have the space with me when I left.  The Rinpoche and I are fairly close and it feels like a home to me, so I would definitely consider staying if I ever decided to fully become a monk.

I went in the first place because I have always wanted to live with monks and see what it was like, and because as I delved deeper into Buddhism I felt a calling to experience it directly first hand."
Was there anything in particular about their way of life that you've taken on board &amp; has had a positive impact on yours? 
How long?

Can you tell me some general differences between what you practice compared to Theravada Buddhism that is practised in Southeast Asia?
"Bless you for doing this.
How many kids have you helped so far?"
"Interesting question.
Red. Red's gross."
Thank you for taking in your granddaughter and for the good wishes.

That‚Äôs amazing!

"I like Christ Rock, which special of him should I watch after Bigger and Blacker?"
"Oh god, heartbreaking, terrifying, feeling like your stomach has dropped to the center of the earth. The neurologist I saw was doing reflex tests on me and did the knee one where your leg twitches once. My leg started twitching and did not stop. He then knew there was a neurological problem and called a code purple (if I remember clearly), which was something along the lines of dangerously in immediate attention. When they finally told me it was tumours, I had been drugged up and was quite out of it and was wandering the hospital halls looking for my mom who I found in a doctors room with a ton of doctors staring at the computer where I saw two large masses on my MRI images. My heart sank. "

I don‚Äôt want to talk to geko because they seem like a dick. What does ‚Äúingess‚Äù mean?
"I was mostly just an English teacher. Sunday-Friday I taught 4 groups of 20 students each consisting of various ages ranging from like 6-22years old. Each group were at different levels but all of them varied heavily in their knowledge of English.

I would wake up at 6:00AM, eat breakfast with the lamas at 7-7:30AM, relax til 8:00AM, teach three 1hr long classes until 11:00AM, eat lunch til 12:00PM, then I would get my own break to conduct my own studies which I usually spent in the library until 4:30, then I would teach my advanced class and call it a day until dinner which I would again eat with the lamas at 7:00PM. I would spend most of my freetime engaging in conversation with the lamas or monks, and ended up forming a lot of bonds with many of them.

There would be three different puja's which are little prayer/meditation things done by the elder monks across the day at 5AM, sometime around 1:00-2:00PM, and then again at like 6:00PM~7:00PM. I mostly only did the night ones.

On Fridays at 9:00PM til 11:00PM the monks were allowed to watch TV, which they have a satellite for. Outside of that they are allowed their own personal items but they're not really suppose to engage in using technology. A few of the older monks aged 20+ would commonly pull out their cell phones when we were chilling in their rooms, but I was told that they would get confiscated if the lamas saw them playing with it. 

And then Saturdays were a freeday mostly and outside of chores and certain other smaller tasks, the monks would play football(soccer) with a small little field. I would either play football with them or study, or just go on a small hike around the area."
Are you right handed?
We are you?
"My parents have tried to ignore it. They‚Äôre extremely paranoid and conservative, and after her diagnosis refused to allow to take medications or inform her of her diagnosis. Instead, she was shipped off shortly afterwards to a religious boarding school for girls with behavioral problems. (I was with her for the first 2 years). It‚Äôs been 5 years and she‚Äôs now 18, but continues to live at the boarding school and is working towards getting her diploma. "
I agree with you wholeheartedly and have had some rough dips and speed bumps as well; I can relate which made me concerned. I hope things get better quickly...I will be sending you maximum positive vibes!! 
"Doesn't that seem like a dull existence though? Sometimes it's just so fun to be caught up in the passion! Like yes it hurts more when you do when it gets taken from you, but you also feel more alive when you do!"
I‚Äôve always wanted to poke the dough please tell me what it feels like 
What did they want you to take away from your time with them. If anything. Was it just about all life being precious or was there more?
"It went pretty smooth I think. Me and my mom were visiting a psychologist because of my problems. She asked my mother about that. I was shocked for a while, but now it's nothing fascinating for me."
Are you having withdrawal symptoms?
Did you make any friends? I loved mine and I‚Äôm always curious to know why people‚Äôs experience wasn‚Äôt great 
Yes he thought I just wanted to get out of gym
Why not post the pic to one of the appropriate sub reddits?
"Ran int a wall in fourth grade gym class broke my left wrist too.

Did your gym teacher not believe you were that serious hurt at first too?"
"Yeah, there was this one Italian couple that came in a few times while I was there that would smoke IN their non smoking room (again, we had smoking room options!!), leave hair and garbage everywhere and throw their pillows and sheets on the floor every night. I‚Äôd find underwear hidden in sheets after they checked out, we‚Äôve had to change sheets because of all kinds of body fluids being found, pads/tampons/bloody underwear on the floor of the bathroom, etc. Mostly just a ridiculous amount of hair all over the floor, I swear people would wait to do a full shave and freakin haircut whenever they checked in.

It took some getting used to, and sometimes I‚Äôd accidentally look down (I have trouble making eye contact anyways lol) but usually people were cool about it and you learned to always look up at people‚Äôs faces to avoid stuff like that. People who were more confident and engaged in the conversation were easier when it came to this, embarrassed people would look away so it would be harder to keep eye contact with them haha (It was still pretty hard not to look down when talking to guys, I‚Äôm a lesbian and grew up in an all girl household so that‚Äôs not exactly the sort of equipment I‚Äôm used to seeing on someone üòÖ) Also sometimes avoiding looking at women, especially younger women, was tough because as a woman you sort of want to compare yourself, I think guys probably do that in some form too.

I‚Äôve heard tons of crazy stories from my coworkers! Drug related stories like cops being called to a room more than once after people have left drug paraphernalia (and actual drugs), walking in on a dominatrix as she was making a dude clean the floor with his tongue, almost walking into a dirty dildo stuck onto someone‚Äôs freezer door, lots of offers to join people‚Äôs threesomes, and just general weirdos with weird habits. I wish I could remember more of them, my bosses had worked there for over ten years so nothing really fazed them anymore. As far as my interesting stories, it was mostly just things like seeing totally naked people walking their dogs/doing yardwork/riding bikes, weird sex toys found in rooms and the time a squirrel got into a guest‚Äôs room and we had to try and chase it out before they got back. Sometimes I wish I could go back to that job just to get more fun stories haha "
You‚Äôre doing great. Thanks for sharing your experiences. 
"The Three Jewels are like the core of Buddhism as I understand it. The three jewels are the Sangha(community), Buddha(teachings), and the Dharma(truth).

To best emphasize those you need to seek a community which is productive and beneficial to your growth most importantly. And then to focus primarily on building compassion for life both outside yourself, and within yourself.

I think a solid sum-up for what one should be trying to exemplify is to be mindful and compassionate. So long as you keep those two values in mind and constantly work at being better at them I think you'd be appropriately following Buddha's inherent message."
Did you get steam entry in the monastery?  Did any of the monks attain stream entry while you were there?  Can you give a percentage of monks that were stream enterers?

It wasn‚Äôt that bad. Just a quick pinch really. There wasn‚Äôt much time to think about it. It feels really good when I when sex. It stimulates the inside of my urethra. 
"I'm a Westerner (New Zealander) who has very recently been slightly accepted into a Buddhist Nepalese family through a prospective marriage.

Part of the conditions of said relationship with their daughter is that I embrace the Buddhist culture and practices.

What would be some simple, yet effective, ways of showing my dedication towards embracing this and being accepted into their family?"

"Cool stuff! Yeah, I agree about the internet side-effect business. It's a drag, but I feel like with effective marketing it's still possible to make a living at it, even in an online world. For the next few minutes, at least. I just hope the whole damn internet shuts down eventually.

"At first it did, it still does sometimes even though I‚Äôm not there anymore. More of a wonder than a worry. There were days that were worse than others and I would need to just take time for myself. It helped me out things into perspective. "

Did you pimp your wheelchair?
No
"you can get involved but it is incredibly tough, merely because of the fact that everything is based upon trust and who you know. There are hundreds of different roles that are assigned to really anyone, often non Russian members of the family itself. However, main members are based upon family members and those incredibly close to the family. Essentially, if you meet the right people and attain honor, eventually you may get to join the *family*. Being Russian and coming from a primitive family helps your chances. "
