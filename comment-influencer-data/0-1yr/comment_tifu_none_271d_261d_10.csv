Good luck at your new job
"I have a big dog and purchased the same toy, but in a nice light blue. Never really thought about it, time passed. 

I’m flying my cheap amazon drone in the yard and get it stuck in the tree. I pickup the “dog toy” and toss it up into the tree. It gets stuck 20ft up in the front yard.... drone falls down later on that day on its own. 

Friend drops by a week later. “Dude, did you see the huge dildo in your tree?”

It’s still there months later. It remained firmly stuck even through a hurricane. Dozens of people have asked. Now it’s just the neighborhood dildo tree. "
"I woke up from surgery and I could feel something going on down there.   I told the nurse ""I think I'm peeing"", and she told me I had a catheter in and she could take it out now.   

I must have looked terrified, because she pulled back the sheet, looked and reassured me ""It's okay it's just a little one."" "

"I'm a grower, not a shower and the last time I had surgery that required a catheter I'm pretty sure the nurse taking it out was doing it (with supervision) for the first time and in my post op, post anesthesia haze I said ""I can make it bigger if it helps"".  

That was well over 10 years ago and I am haunted by that incident.  First, because I said it and second because there's no way I can remember their faces since I was so out of it but I'm 100% sure they remember mine...so I always have to live wondering if the lady next to me picking out bell peppers in the produce section remembers me as ""that one guy""."

"Hi, Uni-admin here,

Here's what you do; go to your program advisor, Chair, Director, prof, all of them.

Tell them what happened. Throw yourself on their mercy. Fall on your sword. Explain why you were ""busy"" was it work? Family? What? (If it was video games don't tell them that.) Tell them you simply ran out of time, that you know its entirely your fault, and you accept the consequences, but if there is any way they could accept a late paper, with penalties of course, because otherwise you won't graduate on time with the rest of your cohort, and adding another year of school is going to be a financial hardship for you and your family.

Promise to go to all the time-keeping workshops your school offers, heck, sign up for them NOW, say that you recognize this is only your problem and you're taking steps to correct it.

Do not show up in person, its the end of term, and we are soooo busy, but send an email and cc everyone. Good luck!"

It is an actual condition. I know about this because it has happened to me. It has to do with your pelvic muscles going into spasm mode. You probably have a hypertonic pelvic floor because you carry your stress in your pelvic muscles without you even knowing. You can get it checked out with a pelvic floor specialist and go to pelvic floor therapy to relax your muscles and avoid any other experiences like that. You can message me if you have any questions :)

"Ouch! But to be fair, we all occasionally blurt out things we don't really mean.  Maybe this story will help you feel better.

So, my wife is a non-native speaker of English and one time we were at the grocery store shopping.  I see this package of cocktail wieners that are super-sized--I mean, they're like 3 inches long.  So I pick it up and show it to my wife, thinking I'm being funny by saying, ""Hey honey, check out the size of these wieners.""

My wife glances at the package and without hesitation announces, ""Bigger than yours."" And continues on pushing the shopping cart, leaving me standing there just completely stunned.  

On the one hand, I was upset and wondering what I had done to piss off my wife.  On the other hand, the culture my wife comes from doesn't really do dissing or sarcasm, so I was hugely impressed that her English had developed to the point where she could deliver such a savage verbal beatdown without effort.  

So, I got over my hurt pride and told her how impressed I was at how her English was improving and she gives me this confused look.  I'm still holding the package of cocktail wieners so I explain how being able to deliver such an (admittedly funny) insult so quickly shows how much she's grasping American culture.  My wife looks even more confused and asks me to repeat back what she said to me.  I tell her and she doubles over laughing.

Turns out, she meant to give me a flirty, ""Yours is bigger,"" but in working out how to say it in English she actually wound up saying the opposite.  

So now it's a running joke with us that whenever we go grocery shopping together my wife laughingly says, ""Bigger than yours"" as we pass by the cocktail wieners.   "
"Unless she's allergic to any oils, it's most likely just the normal burning that occurs when that oil gets on any mucosal lining of the body.
I'd try using a neutral oil to dilute what's already on, using soap to wash it off, or a combination of both. Most likely though, it'll be something she has to let pass."
"This is on the right track. Your body only has so many ways to physically relieve stress, so if you were truly stressed like that your body may have triggered a mechanism to physically relieve stress because things weren't getting taken care of otherwise.

May want to take a cue from your body and focus on managing stress levels. It can be something that everyone struggles with at times, but remember that there are physical ways to provide some relief"

"On a side note from someone working at a university in Europe: Being late, handing in assignments late, sloppy formatting, low term paper standards, asking for exceptions, etc. -- even if you get away with these things, they can make a long-lasting bad impression on evaluators.

"Well, they do say misery loves company, so...

I remember when a buddy of mine ran screaming off of the field during (American) football practice because he made the mistake of putting one of those IcyHot patches rather high up on his thigh. See, the thing is that those were essentially the 1st gen of the patches, so they weren't exactly ready to take on high activity yet. As he put it through its paces, his sweat started to shift the patch, causing it to curl back onto his junk (both twig AND berries). The thing about football pants is that they're like capri leggings and they do two things: 1) Leave little to the imagination and 2) They damn near vacuum seal your bottom half.

With that in mind, it wasn't too long before he had the look of pure, morbid horror on his face which was quickly followed by him booking it to the locker room and ripping his gear off as he went. Later, we all found out that he had chemically burned his meat and potatoes and had to have the on-site sports physician (a rather surly woman) apply a topical cream to alleviate his pain/copious ugly crying.

For the rest of his high school years, he was given the nickname ""Hot Dog"" and I'm pretty sure there wasn't a single person who hadn't heard the legend. Thankfully, he was a good enough sport about it, although he did make the switch to Bengay after the fact.

Hope his misery gave you a bit of good company and good luck bub!"

No way. A girl with that much class gets to see the local roach motel lol. 
"""pretty good, average size""
OMG, please, just stop. I don't think I can feel any worse for your boyfriend.

Could you imagine your boyfriend describing you as ""Well, she's pretty good. Average looking.""  SMH"
"The weird thing is that I noticed the first pile myself while waiting and I actually stepped away just in case she met me and thought ""who is this weirdo who stands near dust""

Obviously didn't move far enough"
Immediate resignation.  Save yourself the humiliation of being fired or having to face the others if you're not.
now the punishment was genius.
They call it fire because it burns baby.  Maybe more of an emotional burn in this case but also maybe some stinging in the eyes.
Wow this has to be one of the most embarrassing and self-incriminating TIFU's I have read here. Though the mind boggles why you have a work colleague 'snapchat' group. If I want to communicate with my workmates I call or SMS them. Snapchat??!! Yeah I just don't understand without more context of your employment situation....
"I saw this happen back in '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abbie Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella."
"Honestly, she left it on because she wanted to be able to fuck with you.  She obviously isnt stupid and knew the best way to mess with you was to do what she did."
But in case you get the icy hot on your vagina again (super bad luck I guess) don't go rubbing any lotion with vit.E on it. It may help reduce the burning hell but a lot of products are not meant for the vaginal flora and it may cause you other problems. Just check it before you use it too or you may end up with a few issues instead of one on your lady parts xD 
Probably my favorite theory. 
Once it stops being cold do all the trees just stink up the campus?
Wow. You kept your cool very well.

"Doesn't matter, had sex."
Women often have quite a lot of actual cum too. If I were to orgasm in this sense I'd definitely leave a patch!
Kinda like the degauss button on old monitors I used to press in elementary school 
You’re golden. You will never have to wave or say hi to this guy. 
Suck your own dick more to build up tolerance
"""He’s actually a pretty good, average size""

Am I the only one that double laughed out loud reading that? That's like just another burn after the first one."
"I just read about something like this happening recently in another post. If i remember correctly, lotion with vitamin E helps relieve the burning sensation down there. I forgot why but the ingredients in lotion plus mixed with vitamin E help sooth the burn. Good luck and I hope this helps

I can fuck for hours and cum 20 times without even getting an erection

Just think what she did in that 45 minutes besides make coffee.

"Really it's nothing interesting, the underground trains stir the air up through the tunnels and it inevitably ends up at the stations and gets swept up. It only features so heavily in the story because OPs date was fucking nuts and thought it was fuck only knows what else. "
"well, this took me way too long to understand

for those who are as dumb as I am:

he called her heavy by accident"
"Fucking spat my drink out. Good show friend

Edit: still laughing. This right here is my humour 5/7 perfect score

Thanks Left____right (I hope I got the right amount of under spaces 3 is what I think I did!)

"I totally hit on the (male) nurse who was looking after me in recovery. I cringe when I try to remember what happened, but I’m pretty sure I had no inner monologue, and said something to the effect of “Well hello there, handsome!” out loud."
Not sure what I expected as a response to that comment but it sure wasn’t that
I’m pretty sure one my friends ratted me out. (The one I saw walking with the principal) Otherwise I don’t think there was any way to pin it on me
This is the comment that left me laughing out loud and getting strange looks. A+ would read again. 
"You’re telling me 12” isn’t average? It has to be 18”. I swear the last time I checked 23” was average. That’s what the internet says, and you always believe everything you read on the internet, at least that’s what I hear from the internet."
"&gt; edit - tifu even more by trying to justify his dick size. thanks yall

You didn't. They edited it out after reading peoples reaction to it. Honestly worth a new TIFU post on its own."
I love how wholesome and dorky your whole story is ♥️
Lmao that is one hell of a TLDR. Damn that made me giggle hard. 
You got what you deserved

You've actually smelled it yourself before? Just how bad is it?

"I never go to the doctor.  Maybe 3 times in the last 20 years.

Blood from my dick is where I draw the line though.  Go to a doctor."
"Look the cashier dead in the eye after limping to the register and say ""you wanna play fetch?"""
Idk man you can get in some serious shit for this as a worker and the stress and trauma potentially caused for the server. Definitely not petty in my book. The OP is a dick.
"The first time was an accident, the other 300 times per year are why you started with ""used to date"" ;P"

"I’m guessing fresh air and rain eventually take care of it, seems like they have to retreat the trees every year."
a lot of girls are completely fine if a guy cums very fast when receiving head. makes their jaw hurt less and they are happy they were able to please. i'm a guy and i had a gf who would cum from oral in about 4 minutes...i was so happy....
"article 5, section 20.A of the constitution "
"I want to second removing any coworkers from social media. I have that policy, not because I'm some weirdo, but because I value keeping work separate from home life. I have some coworkers who have taken some offense to it but it's my way of protecting myself, my family, and my job. "

You should probably stop dousing yourself in cologne every few hours. It's likely annoying others at work.
"You should have done the ""It a fucking demon! RUN RUN!!!! I will hold it as long as I can!!!!""

I mean yeah she may have thrown herself through a window but you could have easily got out of the date"
I told a very flamboyantly gay nurse that he was Prince Charming for helping me put my flip-flops back on after surgery. I distinctly remember him telling me 'no I'm more like the fairy godmother' lmao
Might want to post on /r/legaladvice as well. This could become a legal matter very easily.
a girl i used to date said she would have accidental orgasms at the gym by doing leg raises on a dip machine
So what country you moving to?

He doesn't want to cause some poor detective to have to investigate *his* case.
"That’s an impressively fast justice system. These charges were laid, a court date was set, OP went to court, pled guilty, got sentenced, served his sentence in the stinky house, and all of that was accomplished *before* the deep cleaning of the house which led to the charges being laid at all. "
Tell me more about this abdominal exercise orgasm?
OP is trying to slip his tongue into some roll tide.
