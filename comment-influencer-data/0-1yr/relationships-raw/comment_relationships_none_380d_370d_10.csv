0,"Okay, first? Get your apartment cleaned up, make sure you have enough food in your pantry and fridge (and the edibles in question would be what a social worker would consider food), etc. Basically, that you've got a situation where a social worker will say you can provide a safe living situation to your brother. 

Next, call CPS and get the ball rolling. Your parents kicked a minor out. Not only do they deserve all the shame, they're also in for the nasty realization that the government gives zero fucks what their religion says, you don't get to have the toddler tantrum when you're the fucking parent. Why you need to get CPS involved is that your little brother? Will then qualify for aid. Including EBT (food stamps), Medicaid (health care), and even money to cover costs that would go to his guardian once the dust settles. Hopefully, that's you since you're the person he chose and he's been through enough. Hence getting your shit together. 

As for helping Will... cut yourself a little slack. Will showed up *yesterday*. He's probably still in shock. Do your best to be there for him and tell him you're there if he needs you. Ask him if he needs anything. Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid. It's going to take a minute for both of you to process. Just like you're trying to figure this all out? So is he.

You say that you don't know anything about growing up gay... the thing is that you have been his emotional support and you are doing exactly what you need to do. You've shown him that he has a safe place. You will take him in and do your best to figure this shit out. You will do your best to try and be there for him. He doesn't need you to suddenly become and expert on the gay experience. He needs to know his brother loves him, accepts him, and will do his best to protect him. You're good. Breathe. You're doing exactly what he needs. "
1,"Don't let him make you question yourself. Thats gaslighting 101. Look at the facts and trust yourself, make a decison and stick to it."
2,"Your bf is about to be like the rest of his friends: alone at 30+. I know girls like C, they have to be the only girl in a pack if men. I do not tolerate it. I'd tell bf, no more exclusions. C doesn't get to decide if you go on outings or not. Bf needs to shut C down hard. ""Either my gf comes or you can count me out C"". He really sounds spineless tbh. "
3,"&gt;DH told her we could give it to them, but that I would be upset.

This is the biggest red flag here, your husband threw you under the bus. 

Tell him that you both need to be on the same page, and that he shouldn't blame you to his parents for things you should both agree to. 

When your MIL brings up sensitive subjects, tell her that you and your husband need to be on the same page and you don't want to discuss it one-on-one, you should all talk together.

MIL is acting like a kid playing parents off each other, and your husband is making it worse, don't let that happen."
4,"Always always always speak to a lawyer before initiating separation proceedings especially when there is a child involved. Honestly if he behaved this badly on vacation, I would have left him there and gone home to get the separation rolling. As it is now, you’re heading into a major holiday weekend and nobody will talk to you until after Tuesday. 

Good luck. "
5,This is very much illegal. I would call the police if I was you. How do you know he doesn’t have footage saved of you naked or using the bathroom? 
6,[deleted]
7,"That's both creepy and illegal.  GTFO now.  In fact, I'd take this info to your landlord to see if they can help you out with your leasing obligations.  Or maybe even evict him."
8,"So, where are the three of you going on honeymoon?

​

\------

By which of course I mean, this marriage cannot take place until sister has had enough *professional* psychiatric help to be independent. Your fiancée is deluded if she thinks this will ""sort itself out"".  **Never marry hoping things will improve**. Marry to confirm a relationship that is *already* the way you want it -  which this isn't. I understand your fiancée worrying about her sister, but *this is not the way to help her* (this just humours her and enables her to continue without actually addressing and fixing the issue). And it's not fair on you (or on fiancée herself actually). Postpone the wedding, and get sister into proper psychiatric care; because otherwise you basically adopting the sister. But TBH even then I'd hesitate to marry someone who ignores your  concern.

​

EDIT : And as others suggest, starting right now, just STOP playing.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 2: Dude! If these deaths were only THREE MONTHS ago that change everthing.  Still, all the more reason to postpone the wedding. Nobody's ready for that, least of all your fiancée.**

&amp;#x200B;"
9,Let me give you a piece of life advice: Don't date men who frighten you. Ever. 
10,"My wife died of cancer two years ago, she was 33. It was not unexpected as she got much worse over the last few months, but obviously a very different situation from yours as her cancer only came on in 2014. I have a lot of thoughts but here’s my two main ones: 1) you can’t prepare her. She won’t be prepared. It will be awful, she will be wracked with grief, and that’s how it is. She will, hopefully and in due time, get to a better place. 2) what you can do is talk to her friends, her family, people that will remain close to her after you’re gone, and explain your concern. Make them promise to check up on her, ask them to take her out for coffee now, or as your health declines, and talk to her about it. You’ve gotta farm this one out to people you trust who care for her. 3) just for the hell of it. Choose these people wisely. A few people in my life stopped talking to me after my wife died. I was warned this would happen by a grief support group and I refused to believe it, but it happens. Some people are very uncomfortable with a survivor and aren’t able to provide what a survivor needs, and others can’t put up with the behavior that survivors display (plans change, moods are bad, depressed people don’t make for good friends). It’s a primal, instinctual thing. People I considered friends just bailed and couldn’t deal with the loss themselves. Hope this helps. "
11,"Yeah don’t. Make it a clean breakup. He wants to keep you on ice in case playing the field is unsatisfying or flat-out doesn’t work for him.

It’s not a bad thing to decide you’re not ready to settle down. It *is* a bad thing to insist that your partner wait for you while you pursue other options. Walk away from this one, OP. "
12,"So he realised he made a terrible mistake, but didn't come straight back? He stayed another 2.5 months being miserable? Yeah right.

More likely, he spent 2.5 months living the single life and trying to get laid, that didn't happen and now he wants his old life back. "
13,"Um, of COURSE he has that footage!! Why on earth else would he possibly have a camera pointed toward the shower? Do thieves usually steal from the shower? Give me a break. There is NO WAY he secretly put up a bunch of cameras pointing into the bathroom, OP's bedroom, etc. just for security. 

OP if I found my roommate put cameras in my bedroom (!!!) and pointing INTO THE SHOWER (!!!!!) I would have called the police, not just confronted them. You are not taking this seriously enough. For all you know this guy is putting the footage online or doing god knows what with it but you're delusional if you're even considering believing his story that it was for security. Make a police report and have him evicted, or move out yourself if necessary. "
14,"If he wasn't upset with you, I'd say chalk it up to some idiotic ideas about family being the most important thing and some notion he had of doing you a favor. That's stupid, but not necessarily deplorable.

However, the fact that he thinks you've got anything to apologize for is pretty disturbing. Your expectation should be that he profusely apologizes both for the initial act and for being upset with you after the fact. And if you don't get that response from him easily, it's time to reassess your life with him."
15,[deleted]
16,"I'm so sorry for your loss, u/ThisButterfly3. 

I'd shame your co-workers/co-students. If it gets brought up (and it may not), just tell them, ""The funeral home gave it to me when my father died a couple of weeks ago. Thank you for your sympathy."" That tells them it was a gift because of the loss of your father, reminds them that your father died and very recently, and also reminds them that a bit of empathy might not go amiss, considering.

If they say anything else, remind them that they're training for a vocation that requires LOTS of empathy when dealing with patients, and it might be an idea if they start with that bit sooner rather than later. Basically, you can take a joke with the best of them, but not about this - it's way ""too soon"", as they say.

Lots of hugs (if you want them). x"
17,"Thanks for this amazing update! Y'all are extremely cute. I bet you're boning up on your chess skills now, right? lmao. Good luck!"
18,Don’t get married until you’re ready. 
19,"I work in Child Safety. This is the best advice. If you get them involved, you can be registered as his carer and receive the same benefits they give foster carers - including social work support, they'll help you out with bills and food, and depending on where you live will pay for things like school camps and driving lessons (our older kids get these where I am as part of transferring from care and into adulthood). 

If you want to know exactly what CPS workers and social workers are looking for during home visits, hit up my inbox. I'll be glad to help you. "
20,Why aren’t you invited to hang with them? Why are you putting up with him hanging out with a group of girls and a former sexual partner for Labor Day weekend? Why don’t you want to confront him? You are letting things slip and from what your post says it sounds like you aren’t ready to stand up for yourself.
21,"I think self preservation wins this one. I would not do anything, except be wary of future contact with him."
22,"Look, I’ve been in a relationship for seven years, and I felt like I had to be “selfish” and do the self-discovery thing earlier this year. I took a solo cross country road trip and called my boyfriend almost every day. I sent him pictures of my hikes and he sent me pictures of our cat. If your guy wanted to spend time in a different city without you but maintain the relationship, that’s a very doable thing! Doing it the way he did seems like he had other ideas for his solo time that didn’t work out the way he wanted so now he’s come crawling back. 

I don’t think it’s selfish of you at all to think of yourself first here. Only you know if it’s worth it for you to take him back, but really consider what it was that he wanted to accomplish on his summer trip that couldn’t be done while still committed to you and calling or texting every few days. "
23,"I’d divorce her. Honestly from what you wrote, it sounds like she’s making you feel manipulative when you’re not, you’re just miserable. My ex did that to me to make me believe I was the one who needed to change and not them. 

She doesn’t even care you had a serious suicide attempt that required you to be talked down by first responders? No presents or even watch them open presents? Your kids deserve better then that. Depending on your kid’s personality that stuff can really mess you up (my mom was the same)

You deserve happiness dude. You’re not happy with her, she refuses to do her part, accused you when all you said was you needed to save, blew a shit ton of money, yeah no. It really does sound like you’re not manipulative and she’s the one saying that to keep acting this way"
24,"&gt; I'd be grateful for any advice on how to respond to anyone at school who brings this up.

""As I'm sure you can understand, this is a very difficult time for me, not to mention a sensitive issue that is still under investigation, and I'd prefer not to discuss this.""

&gt; Is it even worth trying to make sense of who she is as a person given all those deceptions?

Nah. "
25,"Okay, first... you both love each other more than you want to be right about the scenario, correct? So, it's fixable. There's an easy way to handle this. It's called the casual mention. When arranging this little meet up, you casually mention the girlfriend in your email conversation. Something like ""Yeah, I'll be running a little late to coffee, I just have to drop something off for my girlfriend."" 

Is coffee suddenly cancelled? It was a date. "
26,"Gaslighting. That’s what this is. And this is exactly what my boyfriend did to me when I caught him cheating. I was literally logged into his POF account looking at the messages and he was trying to deny it, and trying to make me seem crazy for believing it. You are not crazy, he is a cheater. You are not crazy. One more time for good measure: YOU ARE NOT CRAZY no matter how he makes you feel about this. "
27,"No fuck that shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Your boyfriend went way over the line with just the phone call, was warned that was a major no, then double-downed by giving you a ""surprise"" dinner with the man. And to top it off - it was at your favorite restaurant, too! He is 100% in the wrong here, and if he doesn't want to own up to it - I'd break up with him. Hopefully you rent because I'm sure your BF gave your dad your address by now, might be time to move. "
28,Honestly after reading your post  I'd say : GOOD RIDDANCE. 
29,Prosopagnosia/face blindness is a real thing. Maybe read up on it and try to explain it to you co-worker again? She probably thinks it’s personal (that you can’t recognize HER) when in fact you couldn’t really recognize anyone if they changed their look drastically.
30,"No sorry. The resolution rests with your boyfriend. He’s pulling the coward card. He’s also telling you that he prefers you continue to accept disrespect and unkindness, as opposed to handling this like an adult. That’s what he tells you and what his actions say. And that’s pretty awful when you think about it. 

He’s also trying to manipulate this by making it seem like you’re asking him to make this huge scene. How can he?! Ohhhhh it’s too much!! But you aren’t asking for a scene. You’re asking for an adult conversation. And if he had stepped up the way he should have before, the job wouldn’t be so daunting now.

“No gfs”? “Actually, I’m bringing OP.” 

Talks about you behind your back? “I don’t know why you’re talking about her this way but I don’t like it. Cut it out.”

He didn’t do any of this or if he did he mentioned it, barely, and then stepped down. You’re not asking for much. Why does he refuse to stand up?

Be clear. “Your brothers wife’s treatment of me is no longer acceptable. It’s actually important for you to make that clear. I’m asking you to step up here and manage a family relationship. I’ve done nothing to deserve this treatment. At this point I also don’t deserve to be excluded from things. Are you able to support me as your partner here?” When he responds defensively or with excuses, be direct: “It sounds like you’re asking me to put up with being treated badly so that you can avoid a difficult conversation. Does that sound fair to you?”"
31,"~~I feel like I should point out that your wants didn’t have much to do with what was best for him or would make him happiest either.~~

~~I’m not saying this to be combative or to shift the blame over to you or make you feel guilty or anything like that. The point I’m trying to illustrate is that this is neither of your faults, and neither of you did anything wrong. You both just want different things in life and have conflicting expectations for your relationship that can’t be reconciled.~~

~~The fact that you still care for each other and cried for each other is proof that this is the case. You’re being pulled apart not because either of you are bad people to each other, but because your lives and your ambitions have different trajectories.~~

~~So please don’t hold his expectations for a relationship against him, in the same way that you wouldn’t want him to hold your decision to leave for law school against you. That animosity doesn’t have to exist. You can still be friends without blame.~~

**Edit:** HaHAAA, BOY did I fuck up.

Several commenters have pointed out to me that he was obnoxiously clingy and downright codependent, with some examples cited from OP’s first post. Admittedly I neglected to read the original, and did not have a full context of the situation. That is my fault, and I apologize. Now that I have read it, I completely agree that he was exceptionally needy and has an *enormous* amount of growing up to do. He is immature, overly-dependent, and not really making much meaningful effort to be better.

In normal circumstances, my original comment would apply, and I wholeheartedly encourage people to examine their relationships to see if it may be the case. I've seen best friends tragically morph into bitter enemies because they were simply looking for different things in relationships and didn't realize it until after they had committed and let it create a rift between them and the one they once loved more than anyone else in the world.

OP's situation is **not** one of those circumstances.

Admittedly, my experiences are what made me leap to the conclusion I did. It was presumptuous of me, and I'm starting to realize that my assumption has likely led to a lot of heartache, criticism, and accusations of hypocrisy on OP's part. 

This is absolutely unacceptable. I made an awful mistake, and I take full responsibility for it. I would implore everyone reading this not to do what I did, but since it's becoming abundantly clear that I'm not the only fool who neglected to read her original post, I'm going to highlight a few things from it that further clarifies the situation:

&gt; He can't manage to show up in a timely fashion for anything, can't keep a part time job and whines the moment he isn't entertained

&gt; He is also whole heartedly way too reliant on me. Stupid shit like ""Should I go grocery shopping right now or go to the gym?"" And i'm like, ""Why does my opinion matter? This isn't something I should have an opinion in."" Because it's really not. **What would happen whenever I refused to answer is he just wouldn't do either option and just lay around all day.**

&gt; **In a 36 hour period, he texted me ""What are you doing"" 17 times. 17 bloody times**. I ended up face timing him and was like this is unreasonable, unhealthy and needs to stop immediately. He seemed to hear it but a few days later, he's back at texting me several times a day to ask what i'm doing.

&gt; Every time i've talked to him in the last 10 days we've gotten into a fight. **Everything from a full blown fight to passive aggressive squabbles**. It's reached the point that the moment he starts being passive aggressive, I just say I have to go and hang up. I'm so brain dead that staring at a wall and doing nothing is actually relieving, I don't have the energy to constantly fight with him and deal with passive aggressive comments. He's like, ""Why don't you FaceTime me more often?"" Because **every time we talk, we fight or you harass me about when is the next time we are going to see each other**.

&gt; wanted to know if he could come up and stay in my new apartment for my first week of law school. I said heck no. I genuinely am gone all day, i'm exhausted and I need to be making friends with my colleagues and adjusting to my new city and life. ... This didn't settle well and he's asked probably every other time we've talked about when he can come visit. I genuinely can't even gather the free brain cells to think about what to have for dinner, let alone when I can squeeze in time for a visitor and the amount of pre-work I would have to do.

With all of that in mind, OP absolutely did the right thing, and it couldn't have been any more timely. 

The way I see it, he wasn't getting something he wanted from her, so he was resorting to passive-aggressive behavior in an attempt to shame her into sacrificing all of her independence, her ambition, and her attempts to make a life for herself in order to lavish him with as much attention as he wanted. No matter how you look at it, this is emotional manipulation, plain and simple. Either he is hopelessly naive or consciously malicious, because no one in their right mind would think that forcing the one you love to return from 8 long hours of non-stop studying to over a dozen texts asking where they've been is in any way benign, especially after it's been warned against in the past. 

Even if you take the former optimistic answer that he's just an idiot, it is still completely and utterly unacceptable, and he has a lot of learning to do before he's ready for another relationship. But if you take the more cyncical latter answer, she didn't just escape an overly-attached boyfriend; she deftly evaded a malicious attempt to drag her into an endless cycle of abuse.

Either way, OP saw it for exactly what it was and she would not have any of it. She asserted her agency, and it shouldn't just be accepted, but celebrated.

Like, goddamn. If only more women (and men!) had her willpower and foresight. If more abusers were more conscious (or caring) of the pain they were inflicting upon the ones they supposedly loved. And if only we, us so-called ""relationship experts"", would do more to empower the victims of abuse, instead of criticizing them for not being ""more understanding"" or ""more patient"" for the benefit of their abusers.

Thank you to everyone who was willing to confront me with what I was doing. And to OP, I'm so sorry. You are not a hypocrite. You're an inspiration."
32,"&gt;all Labor Day weekend with her and her friends and not me. 


Yeah, that alone is not cool, Champaign or not.

&gt;I don’t want to start an argument with him and sound crazy...but am I wrong for being upset about this?

Don't be the cool girlfriend. Absolutely not wrong.

&gt;Surely he could just buy another bottle of champagne for my birthday, but it’s not really the same to me...

Of course it's not, because you are now a second thought. That's a ""fuck her, but I'll fix it later"" type deal."
33,"&gt;I've so far tolerated his behaviour

You used the word ""tolerate"" twice. I find that telling. You're not tolerating drug use because Brother is an otherwise good dude, or cheating on his wife, etc. He likes to spoil his loved ones. That's not exactly a character flaw. 

Now, you are allowed to feel as comfortable or not about anything you want. That is totally your right. But where your reaction to your upbringing and parents' struggles is to be self-sufficient (great reaction), your brother's is to ""overcompensate"" and spoil (also great reaction). No one got miserly or turned into a hoarder or stole from relatives in order to get ahead/fear of being poor. 

Life is freaking tough. If someone, with no strings attached, wants to make your life easier, I say let them. That 4WD makes your life easier and your brother's life happier. I don't see the Big Picture Point where turning this gift down makes sense outside of a philosophical discussion. You need a vehicle. He gave you a vehicle. Kinda that simple. 

And I'm sooo glad you and yours are okay after the accident! "
34,[deleted]
35,"Give all of their children candy and sticky ice cream all the time. Let them roll around in mud. Buy them fun toys like drums that explode glitter all over the place every time you have to babysit.

""Oh, those things are bad? Haha, yeah we don't have real experience being parents so we aren't very good at it. Lolllllllllllllll.""

Then they get to deal with the aftermath. Fun!"
36,"Your boyfriend doesn't respect your boundaries. 

He doesn't respect your decisions.

He thinks he knows better than you do what's best for you.

He is happy to go behind your back and unilaterally override your choices.

And when it all went wrong, he tried to blame you and took zero responsibility.

He is a crap boyfriend."
37,"For all the joking/hate this sub gets for saying “Leave!” your story resonates why it gets said so much.

Relationships take work but also should feel easy.   You had to do really unhealthy work to maintain your marriage (ie force yourself to have threesomes). You probably had to do work that looks a lot healthier to maintain a relationship with someone you feel at home with. "
38,"It is reasonable that, while living in this place, his parents would extend a rent-free offer to him but not to you, so the fact that you paid what appeared to be rent does not look like a problem to me *if that was the only issue and you had known about it from the start*.

The fact that he lied about it being rent is not ok

The fact that he omitted that he was holding your payments without your knowledge is not ok

He has no right to decide to force you to save money by phrasing it as a gift he was returning. You were operating under false pretenses and have the right to decide how to allocate your monthly earnings without him pulling a stunt like this.

I would act as calm and rational on the outside as you need to do ask to have your $13k returned, and as soon as you get it, dump his dumb ass for being manipulative and untruthful."
39,"You are NOT overreacting and are NOT selfish.  

It sounds like you may be being financially abused, and not even realize it.  

"
40,"You address it plainly and ask them if they feel like they have lost a daughter or gained a son, whether their family has shrank or grown. It sounds like they have some very old fashioned ideas about ownership, family and marriage and you may not be able to change their views, but you can make yours clear. Good luck."
41,"Two Things

1.) You need to be in a relationship in which your SO understands and respects your tic

2.) You need to be in a relationship in which you are not arguing as much"
42,Oh if they'd just evict him that'd be perfect. The landlord is in an agreement with the university housing office where they offer reduced rents to students. I don't know who'd be technically responsible for dealing with this so I'm just going to contact both.
43,"Your husband needs to tell them that what they say is completely inappropriate and until they can keep their opinions to themselves, he won't be speaking to them "
44,She wanted to break things off with him **NOT** to try and work on your relationship **BUT** because he fucked a prostitute.....why even try to work things out?
45,This really isn’t a good update IMO.
46,"I think going to therapy with them will help. The therapist will be able to see you're fine, and can back you up while helping your family with their issues."
47,"Get the food assistance. Do not ask for his permission. This isn't  a discussion, this is happening. If he hates it, big deal."
48,"&gt;  sometimes we fight afterwards because he says he feels like he’s not living the life he wants

This is a huge deal and I think you need to turn it round to 100% focus on the disrespect your boyfriend has shown you over the years, not her. 

I've dealt with the interfering ex before, and the girl who thinks she's one of the boys so gets jealous of all their girlfriends (completely missing the point that if she was genuinely 'one of the boys' she would never act like that). So I know how frustrating that can be. My partner wasn't keen to 'start drama' either but he would never actually go to an event I wasnt invited to, that's crazy. And he would never actually stand there and listen to her bs, that's so rude. And he would never actually let it affect our relationship. That's a problem, that's 100% on him.

Ask him why he thinks you should put up with this. Ask him what the plan is for the future, what he expects you to do and how are you going to both work past this. Ask him if he actually wants to be a partner for you and put a stop to this at last, he doesn't have to start a fight, he just has to shut her down and stop her having control over your social life and relationship. After 4 years anything less not really acceptable."
49,"Break up. Honestly, if you can't be comfortable at home, where else is there? He doesn't trust you, he's never going to trust you, you aren't happy... what about this situation makes it worth hanging on to?"
50,"Your husband has bipolar that he won't treat, has a gambling problem that he won't manage, and is abusive. Don't separate, get a divorce. Get a lawyer first, then tell him you want a divorce. Given the traits above, this will be neither painless nor smooth, and I'm sorry for that.

Yes, have someone with you when you give him the divorce papers. "
51,"I agree with the other posters.  A guy doesn't suddenly pack his bags and leave, think about you the whole time but never call you or contact you, and then come back.  

He left because he had some kind of plan... Maybe he wanted to get with other women?  Living the summer as a single guy in a new city?

And he didn't communicate before he left, or after.  

Whatever his plans, they didn't work out.  And now he wants back with you.  But, you know what?  Life's too short to be anyone's backup plan.  "
52,"You yourself said that her shit is probably why most of these guys are single.

That includes your boyfriend. The problem is less her behavior than the fact that all of these guys are apparently too chickenshit to stand up to her or to see how toxic her affections are. 

If your boyfriend won’t stand up to her, and won’t let *you* defend yourself, then this relationship is doomed. He’ll go back to being single like the rest of these idiots."
53,"Your “friends” are awful. I can’t imagine doing that to one of my friends - even if I had no idea the meaning behind the teddy bear. Your way of coping is not weird or embarrassing, it’s natural. Take some time to consider if these people/classmates are worth having in your life. That kind of negative energy isn’t needed by anyone, especially someone who has just lost their father fairly unexpectedly. Just go about your day tomorrow as if it didn’t happen - if you can and if they let you. Limit your time around them if you can and finally, try not to let them see their words hurt you - cause they could be just looking for a reaction. If you ever need a stranger to talk to, I can be that stranger for you. "
54,"&gt; I want to talk to them and don't know how to do it without them getting angry.

Let yourself off the hook for their feelings. You are doing your siblings a favor, you are entitled to say no and set boundaries with them. If they want to get salty at your reasomable response to their unreasonable expectations, that is about them."
55,"There is a reasonable explanation - your boyfriend is a scumbag that uses Tinder to find girls to hook up with while being in a relationship with you. I know it's hard if you really love it but trust me, you DON'T wanna waste your youth on a guy who you can't trust. "
56,"He knew he made a mistake the minute he got off the plane, but it took him two and a half months to reach out to you? Yeah, I doubt that.

If I were you, I'd be selfish. Don't date him again, focus on self-care, and find a new place to live when your lease is up."
57,That was an ambush. Reconsider whether you want a boyfriend who has so little respect for your wishes. 
58,You need to cut him off as soon as possible. Tell mutual friends what is happening and ask them for help. Leaving can be dangerous but will improve your quality of life by a landslide. You deserve something better than sticking with someone who constantly degrades  you.
59,You’re addressing a symptom of a much larger problem. 
60,Dan's upset with himself because now he's going to look like an asshole. Which he is. Because he offered up someone else's home to strangers! Who does that?! Stick to your guns and tell your husband to address this with his brother directly. 
61,"You aren't overreacting, he broke your trust and doesn't really respect you if it's true. I'd ask for the money back now, how do you know he even still has it really? This would be relationship ending in my book. He is treating you like a child not a partner. "
62,"You don't have to get married if you don't want to, that's it.

Entering a marriage via an ultimatum is a terrible way to start."
63,"You've been there 6 months.  This dude has been here two weeks. Go to HR now while he's still ""the new guy"" and tell them exactly what's happened.  Have your coworkers corroborate your story.  Get him out of here."
64,"Holy crap.  Go to Walmart and buy a big tent and stay at a campground.  Put your bigger belongings in a storage unit.  Campgrounds have showers, toilets, etc.  I know your in FL, so get site with power so you can run a fan in the tent.  You can’t live with that crazy any longer.   "
65,"I work in a domestic violence shelter. This man is violent and by bringing him into your home, she endangered your life. In our shelter, we have the rule that if a woman brings her abuser to the shelter or informs him of the location of the shelter, she is banned from the premises immediately. Because this endangers everyone in the shelter, including staff. 

Although your friend is in a tough situation, she still allowed her relationship to put you into danger and that is not excusable. You are not being too harsh. "
66,"&gt;Update 1 - my brother said my dad states that the call was not what my wife’s friend is making it out to be, and that he is being made the bad guy in the situation.

What context would make that call appropriate? What possible circumstance could justify your dad calling your friend? How could a phone call to a friend like that not be construed as the wrong thing to do? I'm genuinely curious.

You've played naive to this point but will you accuse your friend of lying or finally start to reflect on what your parents are doing?"

68,"Make a therapy appointment. Now. This is too big to sort through on your own and, as you said, you need an unbiased party to give advice.  I would suggest giving yourself at least 2 appointments before deciding on anything - they will probably have to be pretty soon and close together, since if you decide not to have the baby then you'll want that settled sooner rather than later. But if you are at all like me, you'll need the first appointment just to word-vomit about your grief, your concerns, etc, and then the second appointment can be more seriously about ""do I want this child.""

I'm so sorry for your loss and I hope you find a path forward that gives you peace."
69,"This? Is fucking amazing. The fact that you value and trust this friend enough to ask him to accompany you on such an important purchase is so wonderful to see. You could go out, do lunch, get the ring. 

I know it's mostly about your anxiety (and I do hope you're getting help for that) but I think what you want to do is wonderful."
70,"I'm 49, so no honey, it's never going to end. Even if you meet the ""one"", get married, have kids, he may one day decide that ""I'm not in love with you"". That's life. After many a relationship, I've realized something you can realize now. The one love affair that matters is the one between you and yourself. Silly, I know, but it's true. Learn to love yourself. Then  you can choose to have or not have a relationship with someone else over time. You will be happy either way, because you will have the one relationship that really matters, with the person who you can really count on and will not betray you: you. "
71,"Call CPS, it's illegal for your parents to throw your brother out. They should at least be paying you to look after him."

74,"You’re eighteen, barely more than a kid. I’d be stunned to meet any eighteen-year-old earning much more than minimum wage. At that age, you’re still finding your way in the adult world.

Don’t lease a flat with him. In fact, you’re better off without his negativity and his parents’ crap. "
75,"&gt; I owe him anyway for the times he's supported me financially

He's only had to do that because he was stealing your money giving you $1,000 less each month to work with."
76,"No, you shouldn’t tell your sister. 

Oftentimes, people being ugly are just a reflection of their own low self-esteem. For whatever reason, your sister feels relief when she says these things. Instead of just telling her to stop and that she’s being mean, you’re gonna have to hit her right in the feels. 

“I don’t know why you feel the need to keep bringing this up, but there’s no reason to put her down. She’s over 10 yrs younger than us and her self esteem is in the gutter. Does this make you feel better?” "
77,"&gt;Last night, around an hour after we had both went to bed, he asked me if I was still awake. He told me that he couldn't sleep, so he reached over, squirted lube on his fingers, and inserted them inside me. I freaked out and told him I didn't want to have sex, then left the room to calm down. His response to me was that he REALLY needed to have sex. 

Everyone has different boundaries, but this would be break-up territory for me. He “needs” sex, so he shoves his fingers inside you when you’re half asleep? Wtf?"
78,"Also, if he was afraid of OP stealing his stuff, he'd put a camera in *his own* bedroom, not OP's. The only reason you need to film someone else's room is if you want to see what happens in there. "
79,Let her move out and tell the wife. 
80,"I think you are exhausted from the over abundance of drama. It was too much for so little. 

Drama is passion-like but toxic ultimately. Try simplifying your life and find peace.  This chick and you likely won’t maintain that. "
81,"He feels he’s already lost you?

Your husband is so fucking dramatic and manipulative, it isn’t even funny. This compromise only favors him. "
82,"Sounds like he wants attention. You are going through A LOT right now. I think leaving him would be the best for your mental health. Seek help from a school counselor if you need to talk to an impartial party and lean on your friends and non-abusive family during this rough time.  You got a beautiful future ahead of you, and this dark time wont last forever. Surround yourself with the people you love right now."
83,"Sounds like the right result, law school is no joke. Especially if you’re interested in corporate/big law/ white shoe firms. The fact he didn’t fight it actually shows that maybe he wasn’t so immature, you guys just had different needs from a relationship, which is fair.

I’m not a text all day person when I’m busy either, whereas some people do it to keep them sane. Incompatible, best to both move on and be happier "
84,"&gt;Ask him why he thinks you should put up with this.

While you're at it, ask him if he'd be okay if your male friend was nice to his face, then used their interactions to talk shit to you, organised events that specifically excluded him, all the while seeding doubt to try and break you up, for *four years*. See if that lights a fire under his arse."
85,Spoiler alert OP and Ian buy a nice house in the suburbs and have 3 kids and a golden retriever
86,"I don't understand why she had to sleep in *your bed* when she stayed over? I mean, I've definitely had my male best friends stay over and there have been times I've shared beds with someone who was a friend, male or female, especially when like camping. But when there are three people and two of them are a couple? That's just beyond weird. "
87,Your boyfriend is pretty inconsiderate.
88,"You block his number, then make an appointment with both HR and your supervisor informing them of everything you posted, especially what he said about your fiance.  Then tell them that they need to speak to him. "
89,"&gt; She also says that her sister doesn’t like being alone and she needs to be there for her 

Fine, but **you** don't like having no alone time - where's her consideration for your feelings in all this? Wanting to support her sister is one thing, doing it **at the expense of her fiance's happiness** is something else.

&gt; She can’t understand how this could possibly be stressful to me. 

Thing is, she doesn't have to understand it, she just has to accept it. Bluntly, this isn't really a problem with the sister, it's a problem with your fiancee. You may need to make this your hill to die on - switching houses all the time is stressing you out, it's affecting your work, and you just don't want to. **So stop doing it.** She wants to spend all her time with her sister? Fine, she can, but you're staying put. If her sister's struggling so much she should be seeing a therapist, not leaning on family to the extent that it's ruining their lives.

Ultimately **you deserve to have a life**. You can be supportive and sympathetic and help out *where you can* without derailing your entire lives for her sake. Your fiancee might not understand, but if you flat out tell her ""this is a major problem for me, I'm not happy, and I want to find a better approach"" she needs to listen. Because if someone she's marrying tells her that, and her response is basically ""get over it"" or ""I don't believe you"" or ""tough luck, my sister will always come first and your feelings don't matter to me"", is that really someone who'll make a good partner?

""It will sort itself out"" might be something she truly believes, but it's not good enough, because it's not happening. You don't have to tell her to cut off her sister or anything so dramatic, even if she spins it that way, but fundamentally a) you should come before her sister, and b) this should be a problem you work on **together** and find a level you're **both** OK with. Her telling you ""this is how it is, suck it up"" is **unacceptable** in a relationship, and especially a marriage. You need to compromise - you'll spend more time than you'd like with her sister, she'll spend less - neither of you get exactly what you want, but neither of you is unhappy either. At the moment you're clearly resentful, that will only get worse, and it will **kill** your relationship.

90,"&gt;  he said he’s “not going to ditch people anymore”

Uh, what? How would he have been ditching them if he already had plans with you? That just doesn't even make sense. The only thing that I can think is that maybe he actually already said he would go to the game and forgot about your anniversary brunch. That doesn't excuse what he did, of course and you have every right to be upset.  The person who got ditched here was you, and that's not cool. Him trying to minimize it and say it's ""no big deal"" is just totally inconsiderate, insensitive, and disrespectful.   This is not something that should just be swept under the rug. "

**There is absolutely no reason there needs to be ""security cameras"" in a fucking vent IN THE BATHROOM.** 

Actually, there is absolutely ZERO excuse for a roommate to actively (and sneakily) HIDE cameras throughout y'alls living space AND YOUR PERSONAL SPACE without your consent. In fact, if he didn't tell you ahead of time, he *could be* breaking a law. 

Remove the cameras yourself, contact your leasing office about the issue and ask for advice to keep this from happening. "
93,"""I obviously think of you as family since we regularly give you money. Expecting you to stop living above your means is not treating you less like family.

We don't do this for any other family members. I'll treat you just like I treat my parents, by not giving you money constantly."" "
94,"I get it man, insecurity is the worst feeling ever. Here's the deal though, you're the only one who can make yourself feel insecure, and its hard, really hard to fight that shit, but you can do it, and here's some ideas on how to make a plan to come through this shit better than you came into it.

Things you cannot control:
1. Whatever the fuck Ian is doing, or thinking, or saying right now, or ever. So get that shit out of your head. Not only because it doesn't matter one bit, but because you already have the girl, and he wishes he were you. You have this outside impression that he's somehow superior, but you already accomplished something important that he hasn't. That's treating your girlfriend the right way to earn her trust, make her laugh, take her on adventures, and make her feel like she is lucky to be with a guy that knows what he wants and makes it happen.

You are doing all those things right? Because that's what a relationship is. It's continuing to do those things even after time passes, and stress kicks in, and new people come into the picture, and whatever the fuck else life throws at you. And I know you can do it, because you already have with a great girl who is ""Out of your league"" and she did it with a guy who is ""Out of her league"". That's you brother, whether you see it right now or not. And if you're not that guy at the moment, make it a priority. This is the shit you can control.

Find a way to do something healthy at least once a week.
Find a way to do something mentally stimulating at least once a week.
Find a way to engage with your girlfriend about her passion regularly.
Find a way to build your relationship, and the romance regularly.

None of this is complex, but its fuckin hard. Everybody knows that its hard, but you can do it, and you will both appreciate it.

Good luck, I hope everything works out for the best."
95,"That’s so fucked up. I’m so sorry that this has happened to you. Get the fuck away from this creep. 

You could also do some research about the laws in your area related to posting explicit photos of someone without their consent. You may be able to press charges. "
96,"I know this subreddit sometimes has a reputation of jumping to conclusions/ being quick to accuse people of cheating, but sometimes you guys get it right. I feel so stupid for not seeing it earlier. Thank you all for the input on my last post.

"
97,"Op is really falling into that ""cool girlfriend"" trap. 

&gt; He doesn’t seem to understand why this is bothering me and I don’t really know how to explain it. 

Of course he understands. He's a 25 year old man/ He understands the concept that taking a your Gf's gift so you can go and drink it together with your ex while spending an entire weekend with her is incredibly disrespectful. 

He just doesn't care. He also knows that you would be too afraid to shake the boat to do anything. 

&gt; boyfriend has been spending all weekend 

Yeah, he is doing more than spending a weekend with her. You don't take a bottle of expensive champagne to just say goodbye to a friend. Maybe a couple of beers or something.

Come on OP, you know better than this. "
98,"&gt; My wife swears it was consensual and that the student initated it. 

This right here is the main thing about your wife: She was the person in authority, the older person, who should have *known* such a relationship was inappropriate. Consensual is irrelevant; it is a policy violation, at the least to have knowingly gone into this relationship.

As for your colleagues, you can just say you are tired of talking about it and hearing about it. Don't give reasons. Don't defend or attack.

101,"It was not appropriate for her to completely redo shared living spaces without speaking with you first. However, I want to note that it may be a dramatic reaction to something I noticed in your post — you continually refer to it as “my” apartment (not “our”), and talk extensively about the way you like things and the way you want things set up.

Listen, she’s not right here, but I suspect you’re being uncompromising as well. You both need to start thinking of it as shared space and find room for compromise. "
102,"I agree with the groom. You're in the wedding party,  guy! You'll be busy that day.  A long time girlfriend who knows your friends would do well in this situation.  A new girlfriend? No way.  You're not a guest at the wedding,  you're *in* the wedding.  And there will be a part of you that will want to make sure she's having a good time and is comfortable. But you shouldn't be doing that,  that day *because your best friend is getting married!*

If I were you,  I would acknowledge this and then ask the groom,  if he would mind if she came later.  After the standing up part, after dinner,  so that you can have her there for the party part. But for the whole wedding? Nope."

This guy is being incredibly selfish and just wants to have his cake and eat it too.  Don't leave the fate of your relationship in HIS hands.  Is this what you want?  Are you happy with a guy that waffles and won't prioritize you?  If not, then set him free and go be on your own.  You deserve better so empower yourself and go find it."

Time to go zero tolerance. "
108,"If it were me I'd just not chase after the kids at the gatherings.

If they ask you to hold their child for a second and it turns into longer than that, go and find the parents and had their kid back off to them, or simply say ""Sorry, I'm busy right now"". Just assert yourself. "
109,"Why haven't you said anything? Correct his ""correction."" He says, ""you mean your half-sister."" You say, ""no, I mean my *sister,* and I would appreciate it if you didn't keep calling her that.""

My gym manager actually asked for my before and after pictures, and I even ended up in a buzzfeed article (without my consent) of ""15 people that changed their bodies drastically by giving up alcohol""

So yeah, it might not be anything crazy, even with a girl. He just might be looking for validation that his plan is working."
115,"What has he been doing all this time? Has he been going out or talking with other women? 

He’s been fine being separate all this time but now that it appears you could actually put him behind you he wants you back. 

You’re his safety net. He wanted to go out and do his thing, drink, party, sleep around, whatever. But still have you at home waiting for him so when he was done he could come back and continue as if nothing happened. 

He’s been expecting you to be there ready to let him crawl back into your bed. 

Now that you’re making moves and letting him know you’re not going to do what he imagines you doing. He realises he’s going to lose a good thing. If he can’t have you no one can.

123,"There is no 'reasoning' or 'convincing' your husband into becoming a better, more fair partner to you. He is doing all this because it is way better for his quality of life to let you suffer in silence especially if he conveniently ignores the suffering part. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your priorities are (in this order) as follows:

1. the health of you and your child
2. your job
3. your living environment
4. your husband

So. Eat, shower, sleep on the bed (when your husband complains about this tell him ""oh I know honey, I don't mind if you sleep on the couch"") feed your baby.  

Do your job - it is not safe to end up solely dependent on your husband. 

Laundry - Do yours and the baby's. That's it.

Food. You're feeding the baby. You feed yourself (ideally something that is quick, and easy to make for one - can you be fine with sandwiches for a while? ) and that's it. Dishes. You can survive with one plate/bowl/spoon/knife/fork/glass, right?

Your living environment - Stop doing any cleaning. You need things to be minimum ok so you can survive. If (when) your husband does not step up, maybe you'll have to hire a cleaning service if you can afford it. Otherwise, keep the bedroom clean, keep the baby and yourself in the bedroom.

Basically you have to massively drop your end of the weight. Which means it will all come crashing down because you were holding up the whole weight. 

As soon as your husband complains, consistently, calmly tell him that until he can be an equal partner to you in your marriage and your parenting and in your home life, you won't believe he cares about you and you can't afford to care about him. Tell him you are disappointed that the man you loved has turned out to be someone who would let you suffer and not hold up his end of the deal. Lastly tell him that he has an opportunity now to show you that he is actually the fair and loving person you thought he was. 

Tell him that all the work you have stopped doing is the the work you need help with. You both work full time. Either you look after the baby and he looks after meals and the house, or you both do 50:50 of both. Since you can't abandon the baby, he now gets to look after the house. 

Next dinner party he organises, go visit a friend or your mother. Either he'll clean up and cook something for his guests himself (still a win) or it will all fall apart but either way it will be obvious that he can't just stack work onto you and have it magically happen. 

If your husband doubles down, complains, ignores or dismisses see a divorce lawyer. \*Then\* you tell him it's divorce or counselling and you've already seen the lawyer.

You can't make him better and you can't make him want to be better. The best case scenario is that he realises how shitty he's being, feels ashamed of himself and steps up. But the only way that there's a chance of the best case scenario is if you prepare for the worst case scenario - that maybe when it came down to actually affecting the quality of his comfort, he wasn't ever on the same team as you after all. 

Congratulations on the new baby by the way. You sound like an awesome person.

124,"Exactly. My husband and I got together when we were really young. We moved pretty quickly and we were living together within a few months. He was 19 and had some commitment issues and decided he needed 3 days to think about things. I was devastated but told him to take his 3 days. The first night, he called me drunk from a friend’s house asking if he could come home, he’d made a terrible mistake and he couldn’t live without me. I told him to take his 3 days so he wouldn’t have any regrets and to really think things through. He worked evenings, and I worked days, and he told me later that he would come by the apartment while I was at work just to lay in our bed and snuggle my pillow because he missed me so much. 11 years later, we are still going strong and he’s never second guessed any part of our relationship again.

In your previous post a lot of people recommended you head to /r/justnomil you really should. They have better tools to deal with this that here. That being said, you need to have come to Jesus talk with your husband. Come to an agreement ""we will pay your parents electric/gas/whatever bill forever but they cannot ask for anything else after that"".

From what you’ve described, it sounds to me like you handled everything fine, except I may have left out the gaslighting accusation.

My ex husband once had an incident where he freaked out over something incredibly innocuous. He was screaming, grabbing me by the arm and body blocking me so I couldn’t walk away.

146,"My response to him would be: you're minimalist, I'm not. I respect your minimalism. I need you to respect that I have a few mementos that I want to hang on to. If you can't, at least, not make rude remarks about them to be, this is going to be a problem for me in the continuation of our relationship.

He doesn't have to get it. As long as you're not taking over the house with your mementos, causing a fire hazard or otherwise being nutty about it, he just needs to accept that it's not his thing and move the hell on. It's not hurting anyone."
147,"I'm casting my vote with this comment. 

First he fucked up setting up the cutesy reunion, and then he doubled down by getting mad at OP for not falling into her dad's arms and telling him how he, the BF, was so wise and wonderful. 

I would say to forgive him for the clumsy and condescending reunion attempt IF he had remorse and was trying to make it up to the OP. But he's at the opposite end of the spectrum.

OP, you're still young. Move on. This is dealbreaker material. "
148,Yeah...I'd bounce. That's scary.
149,"The fact that your father described your hair as 'metrosexual' makes it sound like you father has more of a problem with hair that doesn't reinforce traditional gender roles than how the hair actually looks on you. Some people are really weird about girls having short hair as it's not 'traditional'. 

When I decided to cut off all my hair for a bit I had to go to two different barbers because the first refused to do it. I loved my short hair to death I was so easy to manage and it was different. At the end of the day no hair cut is permanent so experimenting is half the fun. 

I'm so sorry that your dad is making you feel self conscious but it sounds like he might be projecting his own discomfort with some aspects of the modern word on to a hair cut. Which really has nothing to do with you. 

If I were you I would ignore his comments as much as you can. You liked your hair and cut if off for a very sensible reason. I hope that if you decide to grow it back it grows back really healthy and that you get better feed back from other people.   "
150,"WTF.  How’s this even a question, if your boyfriend isn’t attracted to your body type he can go and try and find one of those Instagram models

Your bf sounds like an ass, and I wouldn’t hit the gym for his benefit "
151,"Honestly, talking to her will do no good. This is seriously invasive and probably only the tip of the iceberg. I'd try to distance myself and find a therapist to help you figure out how much contact to have in the future. I'd personally only be ok with very low contact."
152,"He's cheap, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

The bad thing is that he's a condescending asshole who belittles someone he's supposed to love over 10 bucks."
153,"&gt;How do I even move forward? Can I move forward?

Yes. As a single man."
154,"It sounds to me like you dodged a bullet. Or ""boo-lay"" as Raquelle might say."
155,"You really really need to get ahead of this.   I've been in HR management for over 25 years and it's going to be so much worse for him when his work addresses this with him.  And they will.  You can bring it up in a compliment sandwich, but at the end of the day it's still a brutal conversation that needs to be done.  Also, if he does start picking up on his hygiene habits, don't let him forget that washing clothes is equally as important.  They hold a stank."
156,"Jesus. I don't even know what to say. I'm so sorry that this happened to you and this is clearly way past the point of saving. 

I would 100% speak to a lawyer first before you talk to anybody else. You have a child. Your husband is volatile. It's critical that you are prepared to protect yourself and your kid. They will give you some instructions on how to handle the important pieces of this that you can use, like who leaves the house, etc.

After that, arrange child care and tell your husband in public. Alternately, do it over the phone. Do not hesitate to call the police if he flies off the handle. I wouldn't offer any stipulations except perhaps about custody if the lawyer authorizes you to do so, but that likely will be handled with lawyers later on.

If you trust his parents, bring them in. But be careful with this, sometimes in-laws will flip on you once they realize it's over.
"
157,"So you already know that your boyfriend is emotionally abusive and treats you terribly. Let me validate this by saying that the things you've listed here are incredibly abusive and are horrible. You are in no way at fault for this, and you've done nothing to cause this.

This isn't a relationship anymore. You are stuck in a scary situation and you need to figure out a plan to leave. Are you able to get a friend to help you move your stuff out when he's at work? Is your family available for help and support?"
158,"Firstly I'm very sorry to hear about the loss of your Father and even more sorry that it was in traumatic circumstances.  

*"" as an engineer ""*

It's a stereotype, but I do wonder if your husband-to-be suffers from engineer's brain. Sometimes people who excel as engineers do so because they are intensely practical and sometimes they can be lacking in the emotional intelligence department. 

I'm raising this because his actions in your OP make him seem somewhat unkind and thoughtless, where in reality it might be that he just doesn't really get how his actions make you feel because he can't see past the practical very well.  I find it interesting that he's fixed on your teeth as an issue. Your teeth are a practical problem that he can fix, whereas he can't fix the horrible thing that happened to your family. I wonder if he feels a bit hopeless himself so he's trying to ignore what happened and find something he can resolve?

You haven't raised in your OP that you have any other concerns about your Fiance and you haven't told us that this is anything other then a happy relationship. So with that in mind, I think it's worth trying to explain again just how important this is to you. Explain that you understand that this is a lot of money to spend when the money could be spent elsewhere, but that this is important to you emotionally and that you won't feel right in yourself unless it's done. 

I think in every marriage there are things that your partner wants or needs that you don't really 'get'. It could be a hobby, a taste in music, a love for a particular brand or a personal goal that just doesn't hold any fascination for you personally. It's important to give your partner the space to do/achieve/acquire the things that are important to them, even if you can't understand it. Hopefully you can get your fiance to see that while he might not understand your need to provide a headstone for your father, that it's important to you and it's just one of the things he needs to support you on even if it's something he can't understand himself. "
159,I’d be annoyed if went on what I thought was a date and found out the dude who gave me his contact info had a girlfriend. Best to clarify beforehand for the person you’re meeting and your girlfriend.
160,"Wow, this is an awful situation. Her boyfriend is a cheater.

I've got to side with self-preservation here. 100% ghost this guy and pretend like it never happened. Block his number, block him on Facebook. If you see him on the street, keep walking. If/when you see him at family gatherings, make an excuse to leave under 20 mins after he/they arrive. **Never be alone with him**. 

Might sound like overkill, but you don't want to encourage him that you two could have a repeat hook up -- nor do you want to let on you'd ever consider divulging to others what happened. Furthermore, you don't want him to be in the position to blackmail *you* for favors.

It sucks that you can't be honest, but if this gets out your relationship with your family may never recover. Hope they eventually break up and don't get married or have kids together."
161,"Does he control all the money? He goes on weeklong vacations but you don't have money for a haircut? His money is his and he just doles out what he thinks you really need for groceries, with little money for fun?  

That's financial abuse.  He's controlling you by controlling access to househould finances."
162,"Mental illness is chronic. Spoons theory isn't owned by anything, it is just an analogy to help explain the effects of a chronic illness to someone who doesn't have one.

Keep using the term. Your friend doesn't own it and she has no justification for her gatekeeping."
163,"It may be about the illness and role as sick nurse, rather than the stoma; sometimes it takes really quite a long time to get out of being nurse.

Is this all over, and the stoma is new-normal, or is it temporary?"
164,"I think the best plan would be to sit your boyfriend down and discuss this. Your instincts are there for a reason and if you feel unsafe, make the situation comfortable. I would go as far to say as his brother is messed up in the head somewhere. If he’s hit other people and uses derogatory terms to describe you I would not want to be alone in a room with that guy. "
165,He probably just wants to show off his new body to the body-shamer who inspired it 
166,"I think if you explained why you have it, they would feel pretty guilty about teasing you."
167,"Tell his wife. Not to get back at your wife or him, but because who knows who he’s sleeping with if he’s sleeping with prostitutes from Craigslist, it could impact her health. "
168,"Idk why everyone(including you) is focusing on the porn, I'd be more concerned that he has tried to cheat on you twice already.."
169,"You've already paid back the wedding by giving them money. Tell her the truth, that it isn't up to you two to keep them afloat because they are the ones who won't save. Your marriage and your debt come first. "
170,"And the boyfriend did it **twice.** First on the phone, and OP told him never to do that again. THEN he planned the restaurant ambush and lied to OP.

Holy crap, OP. Dump this guy."
171,"OK, so Alex and Brian are in a funny little war for your attention. Make a mental note never to bring either of them personal gifts again because they clearly can't be trusted to behave like adults around young women or confectionary.

What you do next is not engage any further in their rude and silly behaviour. If either of them raise the subject again, head them off at the pass. Give them a polite, confused half-smile like you don't know what they're talking about and raise a work related topic. 
"
172,"I'm so sorry. Your brother is no longer a safe or trustworthy person and should be treated just like your parents with a full information diet.

Is there anybody else in your life that can help get you out? Your boyfriend's parents maybe?
"
173,Don't feel guilty - it's self preservation to not want to stay in a house where you feel powerless and like you're going to get hit. Honestly I wouldn't even say stay in that relationship. It sounds toxic and sounds like it may escalate rather than get better.
174,Dude. Your parents are nuts even if they do something HALF so intrusive as contact your wife’s friends to ask all those personal questions. At this point you need to support your wife. Your dad is a bad person and is using your brother to manipulate everyone. This is YOUR problem. Support your wife or you’ll lose her. 
175,Lose 150lbs instantly by getting rid of your pos boyfriend 
176,"If their rights were terminated in any way, which I’m assuming they were since your dad has custody and they do not, then they have no legal standing AT ALL. Tell your father what they’re threatening Right Now. Call the police and file a report. Get a restraining order if necessary. If they want custody/parental rights back, they have to go through the court system. They cannot just grab you or threaten you... that’s violating the law, and you should keep all texts and letters from them."
177,"This is actually quite common. Plenty of marriages have ups and downs and different levels of intimacy. He's expressing that he's not happy with some things and that's GOOD. That's communication. He's saying he wants to work on this. He wants this to be successful.

Don't take this is a personal attack because you thought everything was fine and it's not. Take it as a way of improving things - of how you can work TOGETHER to be more positive. Not him vs you in this marriage. Both of you working together.

By pushing him away and saying you can't speak to him any more then you're making it worse. By all means take time to process it, but try to process it positively as this entire post is massively negative. Start making date nights. Take some time. Get pampered. Relax together. Up the intimacy. Talk about desires and sex and if there's anything you can explore. Take the marriage counselling. He wants to work on this, work WITH him.

You are best friends. You have a great foundation. Don't throw it away because you're hurt that he wants more."
178,"I asked for it yesterday and he got very angry. He said that if he gives it back while I'm mad at him, I'll leave him and that I owe him anyway for the times he's supported me financially. I know I should pay him back some of it, but I certainly don't owe him $13k, more like $1k."
179,"""Den mother"" is the term I've heard before, but same idea. My husband's group of friends used to have one, but... not anymore!"

182,"You know what?  I have a female friend whose bf hasn't introduce her to his family after 15 years, and his mom doesn't even know she exists.  I am not kidding.  "
183,"“You are being gross.” It’s time to get real direct 

I don’t let my bf touch me if he isn’t mostly clean. I wouldn’t let him kiss me if he wasn’t brushing his teeth. Maybe you can’t force your husband to take care of himself, but you definitely don’t need to act like it’s ok. I’m so sorry this is happening to you. How’s the sex life?"
184,"I'm a cluttered person, but I at least put in effort if someone is coming over. I also used to have cats, and I vacuumed at least once a week (sometimes twice) to get rid of all hair and tracked kitty litter.

This is how his apartment looks during the stage of him trying to impress you. Imagine how gross it will be when you two get really comfortable together."
185,"OP I wouldn't say a word to him or do ANYTHING until you've talked to a lawyer.  Don't even hint.  Marriages are fundamentally a legal &amp; financial agreement and there's nothing to be gained by him knowing what you're going to do before you do it.  And yes, you need to divorce him, this cannot be saved.  Talk to your parents &amp; a lawyer BEFORE talking to him(OR his parents!), and do everything your lawyer tells you to do.  

Lawyers don't just help with legal issues, too.  You're going to have a lot of uncertainty for awhile, and they've probably seen it all.  They can give you solid advice for how and when to approach this and other non-legal considerations.  You might approach a few lawyers if you don't have one in mind until you find one that can guide you through the entire process comfortably.

186,"&gt;everything I’m looking for in a life partner

&gt;-he won’t stop texting and looking at his phone while driving, and he won’t check his blind spot before changing lanes -he blows money at the casino every time he’s stressed even though he’s struggling with credit card debt -he isn’t cautious with fire hazards


You might want to raise the bar on the whole ""everything"" you want in a partner."
187,You should go to the police not to save yourself from backlash but **to fucking discourage him from ever doing this again to someone else**.
188,"I think it is more considerate (to you and to the other girl) if he makes it clear that he is in a relationship beforehand. She may think that it is a date and be totally blindsided when (if) he gets around to mentioning it during coffee.

Also, it’s going to be just as awkward bringing it up in person as it is over text. Your relationship may not  come up in conversation - will he just not mention it then because he wants to avoid awkwardness? How does he plan to bring it up in conversation? "
189,"OP, I'm a criminal investigator and I highly recommend you call the police and report this. Don't confront him any more. Speak with a detective about this. 

I doubt he would try to blackmail his roommate, as that is just asking for confrontation, especially now that you know you are being filmed. Usually blackmail like this occurs when the blackmailer does not personally know the victim. It is highly more likely that he is selling the footage to websites specializing on ""voyeur"" style pornography. I'm not sure about males, but I've seen female videos sell upwards of $100 a clip. 

If possible, I'd also recommend taking a photo from as similar and angle as the cameras as possible and reverse image searching to see if any stills are circulating."
190,"What an uncomfortable situation! But you were absolutely right to refuse. She is enabling her sons. You shouldn’t endorse that. Maybe you could take her out to dinner or something as a gesture to show that you support her and value her friendship, even though you won’t give her money to enable her sons’ addictions."
191,Jesus Christ it's actually a thing ! Can you be formally diagnosed ?
192,That guy sounds like a real piece of shit tbh. 
193,[deleted]
194,"Your friend obviously doesn’t understand the concept of spoon theory then. It was devised as a way of describing energy levels when someone has an ‘invisible illness’, so I see absolutely no reason why you couldn’t use this terminology, personally."
195,"&gt;the past four years I’ve spend most of my free time with Zac

&gt;I would drive the 30 minutes to his house in the middle of the night, first thing in the morning, as soon as i got off work, absolutely anytime i could be there. I often slept on his couch.

&gt;Now, he is on a two week cruise with his family and zac came over to hang out because I’m all alone in the new house.

I know it isn't fair to judge you and Zach or your friendship based on a short reddit post, but I have to say, based on the information you provided, this friendship sounds like a very unhealthy and codependent one and neither one of you sounds like a good influence on the other. I think you need to be open to that possibility and to the idea that the solution going forward may involve acknowledging that and drawing boundaries with Zac rather than just expecting your BF to accept the situation as it is. "
196,"From what you've written, it doesn't seem like you're confident that you actually want to marry her:

- You were in an LDR for a year. Only 6 months after that she's pushing for a wedding? That seems awfully fast to me. You barely knew each other at that point, so why the sudden urge to marry? Did she actually want to marry YOU at that point? Or would any guy in a suit have been acceptable?

- You've been together for 2 years now (not counting the LDR period), and you still don't feel ready to marry her. Your gut feeling is that it would be a bad idea right now. 

- You describe her as temper driven and reactive

- Your best friend just died. But instead of understanding how awful that is and wanting to support you in your grief, it only took a month or so for her to go back to focusing entirely on how his death affects her arbitrary marriage timeline. 

I really don't get the feeling that she loves you so much as she loves the idea of being able to have a wedding day and being able to say ""I'm married"".

Maybe she feels like you're disrespecting her by delaying the proposal. Maybe she wants to hurry up and start having children. I'm honestly not sure what she's thinking. But her actions definitely don't seem to have much to do with her loving you and wanting to be with you because she loves you.

1.5 years ago, you each promised to work on some personal issues. Have things changed enough/at all since then?

If you're holding off on marriage, hoping that she'll change enough that you can feel comfortable agreeing to it? Stop that right now. Because if you marry her, you'll be getting the person she is right now. 

If you look at her right now and don't see someone you want to commit to, someone you'd like to be your partner in life? Do the both of you a favor and put an end to the relationship.

You'll be free to recover from your loss in peace, and later find someone new.

She'll be free to do whatever it is that she wants."
197,"You tell her that you did the head count and unfortunately don't have room for them, then emphasize what *she* means to you and the role you'd like *her* to play in your wedding. Divert divert divert!"
198,"You could be the most low-key human on the planet and still need to keep up with hygiene and if going to a place that requires you to not look like you’ve just come off a shift painting houses, an effort needs to be made for just a few hours. It’s not absurd of you to ask he maintain a cleanliness. Dogs require baths every month or so, humans don’t have the ability to neglect themselves. He sounds gross and frankly, if you are turned off now, unless he does a complete 180 and makes the shower his BFF, this won’t get better. I would go. "
199,"&gt; It sounds like they have some very old fashioned ideas about ownership, family and marriage 

This is exactly how I interpreted it also.  She ""belongs"" to/in/with the groom's family now.  And you can bet anything that line of thinking is quickly followed by the assumption that OP and her husband would have immediately started working to have kids and build their own family unit..."
200,"sounds weird and awkward, but honesrly, just do it. tell him you want to have an old fashioned make out seasion on the couch. it will be awkward to begin with  but you will warm up to it again. "
201,People don't generally carve words into their flesh as a reminder to help people they love. This is not healthy behavior. I think you should listen to your friends. 
202,"I dont understand how so many people on here stay with an SO like this that doesn't stick up for them, if anyone ever talked to my gf/wife like that I would lose my mind let alone not say anything.

203,"Laughter and smiling as a response to stress or trauma are pretty common.

I laugh like a hyena when I'm in pain. Its a thing, it is known.

Your boyfriend sounds like a jerk though, antagonizing you and making fun of you to your face, thats not a nice thing."
204,"He may be attracted to Jennifer or he may love her like a sister and want to compliment her and make her feel good about herself. Nothing here screams out unrequited love. Seems to me, you need him to pay you some compliments and sing your praises. Sometimes in a marriage, you need to reach out and tell your partner exactly what you need. “When you were showering Jennifer with compliments and praising her, it made me feel insecure. I would really like it if you could remind me of why you’re with me”. Asking a loving partner for that sort of attention doesn’t diminish the attention when you receive it. "
205,"Funny how she was disgusted by him sleeping with a prostitute, and not with a supposedly monogamous married woman.

10/10 would bet that he actually slept with someone else and she got mad that he wasn't 'exclusive' with her, so she convinced herself the other woman must be a prostitute. "
206,"Edit: WTF Op! Three months? How the hell this isn't in your post? This changes EVERYTHING. My god!

----------------

&gt;**Never marry hoping things will improve.**

TRUTH! This, OP, right there. There are countless examples of relationships that have failed terribly based on this very premise.

If you aren't able to solve a problem satisfactorily and without friction before marriage, this is literally a sign that you aren't ready to marry yet. This is just the kind of red alert you have before the wedding to know that something isn't going well and that you need to think twice before taking this step.

From one point of view, you may consider that you were lucky enough to have this problem now. You are having the opportunity to discover how (and if) you and your fiancée, as a couple, will be able to solve problems together. Either you will be able to deal with it and get out of this situation with a stronger relationship, or you will not be able to resolve the issue and you will find out that this relationship wasn't as solid and strong as you've believed.

Either way, postpone the wedding ASAP."
207,"So a chat and a number appeared magically on his phone exactly when you were not in town. 
you know where this is going, right? "
208,I mean he also just stole money that your parents gave you for you. He's a selfish rotten thief. What's next? Stealing money meant for your kids?
209,"Right? All he had to do well tell her in advance, ""Hey, I want to go visit my brother this summer"" and then keep her in the loop/stay in contact while he was gone. His dramatic, unannounced exit was designed to get her to dump him. Because in addition to wanting to fuck random people, he was also too much of a coward to be honest and break things off himself. ""I want to be selfish"" was accurate: ""I want to be selfish and make you do the dirty work for me so I can be free."" Now summer's over and reality is hitting him (or maybe his plan to hook up and live the single life never panned out and he's realizing he gave up something good for no reason). 

I've gone on trips without my husband multiple times. I'm going on another (short) one in a couple months. I told him the day my friends and I started planning the trip. I normally text him when I get in so he knows I arrived safe and send him pics/updates so he knows what's happening (plus, I invariably start to miss him after a day or so; I make him and the dog FaceTime with me). This guy clearly wanted to go away and cut contact for ... reasons. Tons of people take solo trips without their partner but he was definitely being weird about it. He set it up to be all dramatic, ""I'm leaving right this minute"" (and packing up ALL his things, not just clothes/stuff he needed for the trip). He sounds like a weirdo, frankly (slipping a note under the door? What?)."
210,Then in the future if it comes up your husband should point out how incredibly rude/entitled/invasive it is to expect you to house and entertain 10 strangers in your home without even asking you.  That's absolutely ludicrous. How does he think that's an acceptable request? Are he/his GF this entitled in other ways?
211,"*”He has told me that he plans to stop living off of them once he has access to his trust fund.”*

I sincerely hope you see the irony here.
Nick *knows nothing* about working hard &amp; unfortunately, he apparently never will.

Nick has no culture. Or class, or manners. If you want to see an example of class, look at your dad. A spoiled brat walks into his home &amp; openly insults it. Your dad respects that this is your bf &amp; says nothing. Meanwhile your oaf of a bf is loudly defending himself, not embarrassed, he’s justifying trashing your father!

Do you want a lifetime of this? Him openly insulting various people because he’s merely stating his thoughts? Do you want someone who thinks like that?

Run, OP. 
Otherwise you’ll get in deeper &amp; the day will come when *you’re* told your taste/opinion/thoughts don’t matter because you’re a lesser person than him."
212,"If the university housing office is involved, they will DEFINITELY kick him out. "
213,"Your family is being rude in this situation. They’re excluding your wife and not making an effort to respond to her brave attempts to engage. My suggestion? Don’t visit once a week. That’s a ton of time for your wife to spend isolated and awkward. Ask your family to speak in English when she is present - but ask for yourself, not for her. Stop tolerating their very rude behavior. You’re her husband. Stand up for her like you are. "
214,"You were rightfully upset.

He was out of line.

He doesn't care about your physical pain, he has no empathy and he places his ego kibbles (being told I love you) above your physical discomfort.

If you've had problems in the past, add this to the overall conclusions you can draw about his personality and whether he's worth wasting your youth on."
215,"If you do not communicate how something he did made you feel, then he does not have the opportunity to account for that when he makes decisions in the future.  So if you say nothing, and he spends time with her again, it will be disingenuous of you to then be upset because it happened *again*, since he has no idea that it upset you the first time.

&gt; I'm conflicted because I told him I was fine with it initially.

So own that.  Tell him, ""I initially said I was OK, but now that you have described how you spent your time with her, it sounds more like a date than I had initially expected.  I am not comfortable with the way you spent your day with her.""

"
216,"Couldn’t agree more!! I guess maybe he thought he was going to be a hero and reunite this family to be this proud happy Hollywood moment?? He needs to actually realize that he undermined you and tricked you into an uncomfortable situation that you have purposefully not initiated. You’re a strong person, goal oriented, and obviously successful at getting goals and achieving them, if you wanted this relationship, you would have reached out for it. I am horrified that even after you told your BF not to contact him again, he set up this behind your back meeting with a person you pointedly told him you don’t want to see. "
217,"I agree with this. OP it sounds like your family is projecting years of guilt onto you. The therapist should help with this.

Just make sure you get the chance to tell the therapist your side of things and don't let your family talk for you / over you giving the therapist the wrong idea."
218,"She will try to use being drunk as an excuse. She’s 30 years old, that excuse is bullshit. She’s not some flirty drunk 18 year old at a party. This is your maid of honour and she’s trying to kiss your fiancé. Do not let her down play how bad this is. 

Personally, I would remove her from your wedding party. You don’t need to tell anyone why (or tell everyone! Whatever.) I would uninvite her to the wedding as well. She doesn’t deserve to be there. She’s clearly been into your partner for a while, and he obviously caught onto it. If you have no reason to believe he would lie to you, then this girl is TOXIC.  Thank God for your fiancé and his ability to do the right thing and tell you immediately. "
219,"You're supposed to be a team. The two of you are not adversaries. Neither of you should try to ""win"" and neither of you should try to ""punish"".


If you two disagree on something both of you should react with constructive consensus building.

Skills required are emotional regulation, good communication and listening.

Do you think each of you have the skills and motivation to employ these skills? Old habits die hard and that feel good high of winning a nasty fight is hard to let go. "
220,"Check your credit NOW. If you found out about one unpaid bill that she put in your name, there are likely more. Put a freeze on your credit.

Take your car back immediately. You are NOT helping her; you are ENABLING her. You have already given her your car for a year- in this time, she racked up hundreds of dollars in toll violations, suspended your license due to unpaid registration, and damaged your car. She has already damaged your credit (seriously, check your credit for more fraud and freeze it NOW). If she gets another DUI and hits someone on your insurance, you (or your dad) could financially take a serious hit.

221,My partner passed away recently after a short battle with cancer. Obviously I’m not as far into this journey as you but I totally agree with everything you’ve said.
222,"I'm sorry, it's not funny but I can't help laughing picturing a guy looking around his kitchen with this shocked look like he's stuck in some thieves' den.

It's reasonable for him to be a little put off by it. But he should get over it in time. I mean, it's one thing to know your GFs parents were shitty and had you shoplifting a lot of things when younger. I thought maybe a few food items, things like that. But when hearing that you have a ton of stuff and tools and things in all over the apartment that were stolen, it feels a little less like shoplifting and more like just flat robbery.

I don't think it's really anything like he expects you to give it back or whatever, I think it's just more like he didn't expect *this* much shoplifting.

Ask him about it. Reiterate again that your parents totally made you think this was normal, you don't do it anymore, and you'd be willing to get rid of the stolen stuff if it makes him uncomfortable, but you really *do* use some of the items. 

"
223,"If you ever find out the real reason, I'm incredibly intrigued what it could be."
224,"I think you can? You'd have to find some sort of specialist.   


But to be honest if a haircut literally makes a person you know reasonably well completely unrecognisable to you when they're staring straight at you, you don't need the diagnosis really. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's nothing bad, like it doesn't mean you're an idiot or dying, it's just a brain wiring quirk. Most people process faces in their entirety (which is why police sketches are hard), whereas people with face blindness just see 'eyes' 'nose' 'mouth' and don't fuse them together to form 'Laura'. There are other weird quirks like synaesthesia (the number 7 is red!), aphantasia (no visual imagination) etc  But obviously it makes interacting with people sometimes awkward, hopefully being able to put a name to it and reading about it will help you and others understand.

227,"This update makes me kind of sad :( You sounded really passionate about the social aspect of your dancing in the previous post, and it's sad that the compromise you and your husband have reached has involved you forgoing that. It also doesn't sound like the compromise has fully addressed the underlying issues here (him feeling that perhaps he's ""already lost you"", you missing the club scene).

Hopefully therapy will be beneficial to you both in addressing underlying resentments/unresolved issues. I wish you both all the best, and I hope you are able to be happy, OP, whether that be with your husband or without him."
228,"This line horrified me. I don't care how long I've been in a relationship with someone, if there was no build up AND he said something to the tune of ""I need it"" after showing him how clearly uncomfortable I am, I'd have told him to leave."

233,"Your dad is wrong. Even if he hates your haircut, he is behaving childishly about it. 

It sounds like your dad might have some weird hangups about the hair. Like it's a sign you're gay, feminist, anarchist, etc. 

I would give your dad time to adjust and to set some firm boundaries. Tell him you know he doesn't like the haircut but to please keep his opinions to himself (if anyone has suggestions on how to word this better, please pipe in).

234,"I work in transplant, and I have seen lung transplants with CF go on to be massively successful and have great quality of life--so don't rule that out! I've also seen them not go so well, so you're smart to be vocal about whether quantity or quality of life are most important to you. 

I think you need to be realistic in understanding that she is never going to be okay with it. But I agree from your post that she may not understand the reality completely, or is choosing to ignore it. Some people think it's pessimistic to discuss death, but in my experience it makes it better for everyone involved if it's something that is talked about. It sounds like you have a really healthy relationship with life and death and that's great. 

I think you have 2 options. 1) Sit her down and say you need to have a hard but important conversation about your health. Tell her it's important to you that you talk about it and ignoring it is making you feel anxious and stressed. You need to sort out insurance and Power of Attorney and Living Will. These are really important for those with chronic illness. Option 2) Get into couples counseling to have a professional help guide the conversation. It is both your realities and you both need to plan your lives appropriately. 

As for insurance I don't have great advice other than always spring for the most coverage when you're choosing insurance. Most of us are somewhat limited in options due to having to rely on our work to provide a plan, but make sure you don't skimp on this. When/if the time comes, get on medicare/medicaid immediately when you can. 

All of that said, you're 32 with CF and are doing great! That's great! You may live another 30 years! Life expectancy in CF has gone up considerably over the years, and you're a great example of that. I suspect you have great compliance with your routine and that's important. You don't need to broach this topic like you're living on borrowed time, but you do need to discuss what you guys will do, as a team, when your health inevitably fails (be that in 1 year or in 15). 

If she ultimately refuses to discuss this, you should consider who will be decision maker for you (POA) when you need one, if she isn't willing to have conversations about what you want. "
235,She literally told you that she doesn’t want to be someone’s project and then you proceeded to think about ways to get her lose weight. Do her a favor and leave her alone. 
236,"So your problem is that you used to talk about your ex super often, your girlfriend asked you to stop, and now you feel bad because you still want to bring up your ex all the time, but you can't?

237,LOL YOU MEAN EX GIRLFRIEND RIGHT 
238,"Your marriage has been over for years. You are not even friends. You are barely room mates. It sounds like she's not even a mother to her children, which is incredibly sad for these kids.

Since there are children involved, you need to get a lawyer and think about custody and living arrangements. There is no marriage here. There is no coming back from this. You have stuck this out for YEARS longer than is healthy and are still asking if you should stick with it.

This is not a nuclear option. This is the only sane and logical course of action left to you.

Please put your kids first and get them a healthy living environment. This isn't it."
239,"Your gf is probably still in nurse mode. It takes time to come out of that, and it's only been three months. Not only that, but having sex with a person recovering from major surgery is daunting, much more so when you've got a piece of medical equipment sticking out of you. It not an ""Oh, gross!"" thing, it's more of a ""Am I going to hurt him? What if we accidentally pull it out? What if we tear something?"" thing. Maybe put sex on the backburner for a few weeks and try to ease yourself back into couple mode- no-pressure cuddling, more dates, things you two did when you first started seeing each other. Like you said, she's got career stress on top of seriously injured bf stress, so don't take it personally that her sex drive took a hiatus. "

241,"According to the Gift of Fear, ignoring is the best way to go. Just make sure you do not respond EVER in any way. Because if you respond to the 105th call, even to just say 'Leave me alone!', all it does is teach her that it takes 105 calls to get a response from you. "
242,"What about mental illness isn’t chronic? It’s unfortunate that psychological illnesses are not considered as legitimate as physical illness, or that the relationships and interactions between the two are not better recognized.

I would strongly encourage you to limit any time around this person, absolutely do not invite him in your home while you're there and do not be alone with him under any circumstance. He sounds unstable, either mentally ill or just an asshole. Definitely talk about this with your boyfriend, and be prepared for him to get defensive - but do not back down. His brother is dangerous."
245,"Gonna ignore everything and focus on this:

&gt;he blows money at the casino every time he’s stressed even though he’s struggling with credit card debt

A man I considered a good friend gambled away everything, his salary, credit cards, his pension, his wifes pension, his kids education funds, their home, and embezzled money from his workplace. That was the straw that broke the camels back. When his work found out what he'd done (his boss had been his best man at his wedding no less!) they gave him two months to pay them back. But of course he couldn't, because he'd gambled it all away. So he embezzled MORE money, to go and gamble MORE so that he could ""win"" it all back (he did not win it back). His boss found out he'd stolen MORE and fired him and had him arrested. Him getting arrested was how his wife found out that he'd forged her signature and remortgaged the house. And gambled all that money away. And had stopped paying the mortgage. And the house was in foreclosure. 

From beginning to end, this all took... about 18 months? (She lives with her parents now, divorced, and my former friend ended up in a homeless mens shelter.)

What I'm trying to say is do not hand wave away gambling. Some people can gamble for fun and be fine, and some people cannot. It sounds like your BF is one of the ones that cannot."

That is not something you say to someone you’re planning on marrying.

You need to talk with her about the state of your relationship. "
249,"This is such an uncomfortable situation and i’m so sorry that it’s happening to you. They met on a dating app, dated, shagged, and now they’re besties? It’s not like she’s a childhood friend so why the need to spend all weekend with her? Unless their history began years ago and they realised they’re better off as friends and have been completely platonic for a long period of time?

Have you tried befriending the girl and becoming a part of that friendship group?

As for regifting your birthday gift, that in itself is an insult. That champagne was bought specifically for you and your birthday. No one else, and now it’s been regifted."

Hire security for the wedding so neither of them can crash it. And abandon the idea that there’s a way you can pull this off without enraging them. You need to tell the truth- their behavior embarrasses you and would ruin your wedding. Of course they’ll pitch a fit and act ridiculous, but it’s better they do that now and on your terms than at your wedding. "
252,"This woman, her name was Alex, is the reason my last relationship failed. Well, the way my boyfriend acted because of her was but she was too, to be fair. There was one time, even, when we were all talking about possible activities for the night and everyone ignored my suggestion. At first I thought they hadn’t heard so I said it louder and my bf looked at me, then looked back to her and kept talking. Later he said “I knew Alex wouldn’t be into that idea but I didn’t want to make it awkward by telling you that if she wasn’t going to.” I was... stunned. Big long fight and many promises to change, so I stayed, which happened with greater and greater frequency the longer we were together. She even made it a point to remind me that they had become friends initially through him pursuing her romantically and the only reason I was in the picture at all was because she had turned him down, implying that she could change her mind any time and he’d kick me to the curb. I confronted him multiple times and he denied the second part (weakly, in retrospect) but nothing else. I finally told him “you told me you were worried you’d be single forever before you met me, frankly you will be because Alex doesn’t want to date you she wants to own you.” He agreed and said he could see that now and he didn’t want to lose me etc etc and a week later it was back to her BANGing on the door because she “happened to be nearby and needed to use the bathroom SOOOO bad and couldn’t find one anywhere” fifteen minutes after he told her we couldn’t hang out cuz he and I were spending time as a couple. Even tho the gym she worked at, open 24/7, was less than two minutes walking distance away. And he let her.

Suffice it to say, I had such low self esteem that I stayed until he broke up with me, partially for “causing drama” in his relationship with her. 

Man, writing that all out... I feel pretty pathetic. OPs bf will be like mine, unless by some miracle he stands up to her and actually means it, so I feel like her only recourse is to leave. I still can’t understand why Alex and OPs woman would do that, but I guess I don’t need to know anymore... "

255,"And stop dealing with the kids at family gatherings just because there's an expectation you will. Yes, people might glare at you or act aghast that you're not picking up the slack for them, but that's their own problem. You never asked to look after the kids.

And I guarantee that if the kids are allowed to run wild long enough, the rest of the family *will* eventually get their shit together and stop pushing all the responsibility onto you.

256,"I get what you are saying, but lets face facts here.  This guy is 32.  He is aging.  Of course he isn't attractive anymore.  He might need a walker soon.  Lets not give him false hope.  "
257,"This. Why did he wait 2.5 month to tell you he made a mistake? A couple of weeks to sort out his confusion, I can understand but almost three months... red flags."
258,"This is not the best detail to be angry over but I am pissed about the favourite restaurant bit too! Like what the hell was he thinking?? ""Maybe the food will put her in a good mood to increase the chances of them bonding""?? I don't know how OP feels but it would taint the restaurant for me. "
259,"It sounds like they have been thinking about this moment and how you'd react for the past 17 years. Obviously, they expected it to be some dramatic moment, and it wasn't, and they're still acting the parts that they had envisioned...only you're not going along with your ""part."" 

Hopefully the therapist can help them. Best of luck. "
260,"Compare sex to cooking and eating. Tell him that what he wants is like throwing a box of crackers at you from another room and then wondering why you aren’t into it when he “makes you dinner”. 

Seriously this guy needs to be retrained from scratch. He is trying to use you like a flesh light. I can’t imagine anything less sexy. "
261,"You can tell him it's over. Childhood friend or not, the behaviour he exhibited is very disrespectful of  the relationship he's supposedly in and quite frankly that's enough for me to call it cheating. Like, who does that??

Obviously they have feelings for each other and them travelling together over the summer is just another opportunity for him to cheat on you. You've only been together 5 months so get out now before you're more invested in this relationship. 

Why on earth would you allow her to sleep in the same bed as you two?? This baffles me."
262,"Call 911, tell them your wife is experiencing delusions with violent outbursts. Request an ambulance with police. Tell them you need her to be seen for a psych evaluation. If you're in contact with her family of origin, call them. Immediately. Ask if there's any damn family history of psychiatric illness. Specifically, schizophrenia. The doctors are going to want to know. They're also going to want to know about medications, if you have that information. If not, go into her side of the bathroom cabinets and take photos... also her car, purse, and gym bag. 

They will admit her for a hold. She will be evaluated. She will probably be there for a few weeks. You will need to call her work; tell them that she has been taken to the hospital for tests, it's a private medical matter, and that she's going to need to use any FMLA she qualifies for. Please send you the paperwork. Call any insurance either of you has. Remember, mental health is covered by the 2013 parity clause of the ACA.

Okay, if you are having problems getting your wife's patient care needs met by a facility? Ask to speak to the ombudsman. If you are having significant issues regarding medical billing, getting your wife treatment, getting your wife recognized as needing services outside of treatment, etc? Consider hiring a patient advocate. Think health care ninja. They cut through the red tape by knowing way too much about the medical industry and generally can help you find a way to get what you need. Finally, this isn't going to be easy for you. It's rough, it's hard. Please find a counselor for yourself. Regardless of how this ends up, you'll need sessions."
263,"If it were me I would plan a dinner at my house and invite everyone there. That way you're including them in your new family with you and your husband, and maybe they can see nothing has to change. 

Maybe if that goes well, you can contact your family and let them know you still want to be in their lives and want to be included like before. And by inviting them first, youre putting in your own effort. 

I would confront them after that, though. It's not cool that they're excluding you like that out of the blue. They don't seem to be doing it maliciously. Clearly there is some miscommunication or difference in expectations post marriage. 

By the way, I am so sorry you're going through this. I know you must feel awful. It will get better. Lean on your husband and let him know how much you appreciate him in the ways you know make him feel loved. It can be simple. I'm sure he feels good knowing he's helping, too. 

"
264,"It's really not a good sign how MIL has become an accepted part of the marriage.  OP is even doing it, calling her up to talk about boundaries for her husband and getting MIL to agree that their marriage comes first.  

MIL shouldn't even have a vote!  You don't call and get someone to give you permission to set boundaries, to hold your own marriage first.  "
265,"Are you in the United States? If so, it is probably illegal for your parents to kick him out at the age of 16 whether he's gay or not. I know that this is illegal in the state where I live. 

Contact your county or city social services and report your parents. I know that it sounds harsh, but you are not legally responsible for his wellbeing, but they are."
266,"Exactly.  She even phrased it as him 

&gt;swooping in to save the day 

He *wants* her to depend on him. He wants to be the hero,  and is manipulating the situation to do so.  That's f'ed up. "
267,"For me, the biggest tell that this isn't a simple confusion or a lack of social skills is that he's *correcting* you, not *asking* you.

""Oh, you mean your (~~fake~~) half sibling""

This seems like a weird preoccupation with blood-relatedness. If your siblings aren't fully related they aren't ""real"".

Ask him what he'd do if your siblings were adopted. Would he seriously say shit like, ""Oh, you mean your adopted (~~fake~~) brother""?"
268,"Before you break the news to your sister...you might want to sit down with your nieces and nephews and let them know you will always be there for them, no matter what.

Because here's the thing. 

Not inviting your sister is pretty much the same thing as cutting her off.  It will have the same ramifications"

271,"Oh Jesus fuck. I'm a mod of this sub. You can't imagine the fuck shit I see here everyday and have done for years. Yet, I find this the most outraging and outrageous thing I've ever come across. And that's saying a lot.

He has told you in clear and certain terms that your value is less than his. In fact your value is so far below his you are not even allowed to have your own agency as a person. He has done everything to put you in a subservient place. But, know with all that you are, you don't have to stay there. I have never hoped someone has left their spouse more than I do now. "
272,"&gt; But now the last week has been miserable.

It's only been a week. Women have a 4-5 week hormonal cycle so it may be related to that. It might be something else. We've all had bad weeks. You've got to give it more than a week.

&gt; she switched birth control just before the mood change happened

Well birth control well and truly fucks with hormones like nobody's business. I'm sure that's a factor.

&gt; We also started a diet last week which hasn't been easy on either of us.

Well shit if that don't screw things up emotionally I don't know what would.

&gt; Her work is also very stressful at the moment.

Oh fuck - stress sure does eat away at sexual desire and mood, don't it.

&gt; I'm going crazy thinking about how great everything was and how it's falling apart.

Reality ain't no picnic! And making a gazillion mood-altering changes at the same time will make for choppy seas.

You best be a patient pirate and wait for the winds of change to die down - then ye set a course for lovin' and sail her straight for the setting sun.

She be right, mate! Ahoy!"
273,"You sound like you are being abused by a selfish, controlling manipulator. Financial control can be abusive. 

There is nothing remotely acceptable about what your husband did. What do you think your parents would say to his “logic” that he deserved a golf club more than you deserved a gift they had given directly to you? What would they think that your husband has so little respect for you and treats you as so unworthy?

I’d strongly suggest you get some outside help, maybe from a family and maybe from a therapist. I’m skeptical your husbands behaviour will improve. You need to make sure you and your children are not exposed to a lifetime of control and abuse."
274,"&gt; I would help him pay these debts

Absolutely do not do this. Do not combine finances, do not marry him. This is a huge red flag.

The 150k is that a mortgage or something else? But 50k in the hole at 36 is such a bad sign. 

"
275,"I could almost forgive his behavior if he had been falling over himself apologizing after things went wrong. For people who have good/normal relationships with their parents, it can be really hard to fathom that someone genuinely wouldn't want a relationship with them if the parent was reaching out.

The fact that he was ANGRY at her for running out crying after the thing she explicitly said she didn't want was sprung on her without warning? Boy bye. That is so incredibly disrespectful and I don't think I could come back from that. How does he not see how hurtful this was?"
276,"&gt; the thought of moving in with him is terrifying because I don't think he's my soul mate. I find myself fantasizing about fictional guys I could be meeting who I have more in common with and I'm finding sex with Ken less enjoyable. 

So, the thought of a fictional ""other person"" is totally normal and most people do it. But, you're talking about major personality issues. You don't want him to become like his family; you want him spending less time mulling over a sports team. 

You also seem set on breaking up with him but don't want to disappoint people. 

Is that about right? 

In short, you need to take your concerns to your boyfriend, because if he can't make some changes, then you have to consider whether the relationship is worthwhile. Beyond having some laughs and getting along well, what other reasons are there for you to be in this relationship? He's never met your friends and he seems to have an issue with looking down on people (the photo of overweight people is just plain rude). 

If you can't seem to think of any reasons and talking to him doesn't/isn't going to work then you need to end it and vacations be damned. "
277,"She's leaving quite a bit out, she recently posted that they are also in an open relationship that she may not be 100% comfortable with. 

Please op, you know what you need to do. You're worth so much more"
278,"This!

/u/claymetz you know your husband threw you under the bus.

I would straight up ask your MIL:

* ""Is this a divide and conquer thing? You requested money, my husband told you no. Instead of accepting a 'no', now you're reaching out to me with the idea that *I am the obstacle* and if you can get me to say a different answer you'll get the result you want."" 

You can add:

* ""Bottom line, husband was uncomfortable tell you 'no' without an excuse in hand. Why are you pushing this issue by bringing it up to me? You bought up money you chose to spent on our wedding, but if it was meant as a wedding gift it's not a loan to repay so I don't understand why wedding money is part of the conversation."""
279,That makes you the landlord. You can evict him. Look up eviction proceedings in your state and follow them to the letter. 
280,"OP, even if you wanted to be friends with him, asking for that immediately is unforgivably clueless or, worse, a bit sadistic. He's an asshole."
281,"Yup I thought that sentence was so weird to say. 

Op, your brother is being super nice and showing his love, that’s it. Just be grateful and relax. Sounds like you have a great brother. "
282,Ew. You’re super young and you’ve got so many fun years ahead of you. You don’t want to spend them tied to some loser who can’t bother to put on clean clothes. He should be dying to take you out and show you off. 
283,"I got married into a situation like this. This woman taunted me for 5 years. Stupid shit like asking me how much my engagement ring was. To we shouldn’t live in such an expensive place. To you should fluff your pillows in your house. 

It was a camping trip that broke the straws back. Her husband, my brother in law. Told my husband, she was going to slap me. My husband had to have a fight with his brother, like almost literally to get her to stop. It was terrible. She almost ruined every relationship I had in that family. My husband had to practically fight his brother over it. 

He said, “if your wife lays a hand on my wife, I will come and kick your ass first, then I’m going to hit your wife next.” 

They never messed with me again. Like she never came to my house and said a word. 

"
284,All I had to read was “again” in your title. Once would be enough for me. Leave this guy
285,"Yeah, he wants to make sure you are still there in case his dating around flops. Don't put yourself through that. 

What should you do?

You should tell him no, you will not be remaining close to him and talking with him like everything is normal and hanging out. Then cut contact and work on getting over him and moving on. Hopefully you will find someone who values you. "
286,"One guideline you will find bouncing around a lot of support groups is that after something big, like losing someone close, you shouldn't make any major decisions or changes in your life for 90 days. Don't suddenly decide to change jobs, move, ... get married for 90 days. This is to let you get through the shock of what has happened and let you really process your emotions. Even after that? You're meant to proceed with caution and decide if you're ready. You know you're not ready. That's not a bad thing or an excuse. That's knowing something has deeply affected you and that you probably wouldn't be a solid partner to her right now. 

There is actually a book, ""It's OK That You're Not OK: Meeting Grief and Loss in a Culture That Doesn't Understand."" The author, Megan Devine, is a therapist who lost her partner to accidental drowning. She talks about how our culture views grief as an illness we are meant to get over and then we move on. In reality, it's not that; you don't walk away from all of the emotional bonds you had to this person. So, she discusses the idea of finding a healthier way to live with grief. 

The next point? I could give you a whole list of books that discuss this. They have names that involve terms like Emotional Blackmail or Emotional Manipulation. The truth is that using ultimatums, obligation, and guilt as communication tactics is a pretty big red flag for an unhealthy relationship. Even if you agreed to a schedule? You say that you didn't feel ready to get married. You don't feel ready now. That's not a reason to get out a calendar and have a schedule. That's a reason to see a couple's counselor and discuss what might be holding someone back. Do you know why? People's emotions aren't really known for following the atomic clock. They're fickle like that. So, if she does answer a call and you *do* want to continue the relationship? That would be my suggestion. Go see a couple's counselor. Don't do anything until you see one. You two need to be on the same page *and* have better communication skills."
287,"You decide what's acceptable in your relationship, but if my girlfriend spent a weekend with her ex boyfriend she might as well stay with him because it would be over for us.

The champagne would be an afterthought. "
288,Really sounds like she gave up a lot in exchange for him to *saying* he would be willing to stop staying out all night drinking (instead of him actually *doing* any changing). 
289,"It will escalate OP. It always escalates. It starts with a raised hand. It turns into throwing objects or punching walls. Then he hits you. And he’ll apologize and promise to never do it again. But he will. 

Speaking as a woman who once found myself cowering on a corner afraid my ex would hit me, it’s not going to get better. "
290,"Don't make a decision based off what anyone else will think, say or feel. This is your life and you're the one who has to live with the consequence of whatever choice you make.

Your mil wants a grandbaby. This is understandable. But she isn't the one who will be taking care of the grandchild. You will be. 

Your family would have a fit if you adopted the baby out or aborted. Again, they aren't the ones who are raising the baby.

BUT keep in mind you are far from the first and won't be the last single widowed mother. They've all made it work for them. It isn't as hard as some people make it out to be. It just becomes life. 

If you choose not to keep the baby I would suggest not saying anything at all to either side of the family. "
291,"Hmmm. I can see why you might be upset. However, this is his best friend, not yours. He has a whole lifetime to go travelling through Europe with you. You can start planning it with him when he gets back. Ask him to do some reconnaissance for your future trip together. Be happy he’s going to have fun. 

Soooo. It’s natural to feel jealous, but it’s how you deal with that jealousy. 

Good luck."
292,"You want him to shut up and tell you the truth because you think you deserve it. He is never going to admit to it. Maybe when you dump him, he'll finally sack up and tell you but that's him being manipulative. Hes dug himself into a hole and he's gonna keep on digging. Leave now or you'll feel like an idiot for staying. Youre not going to get any closure from him. Take a deep breath and walk away. You're done with him. "
293,"In my experience kids don’t lash out for no reason. Eve is 17, practically an adult. Why is she acting like a 10 year old? I’m concerned that your daughter isn’t able to regulate her emotions and that will lead to poor decision making in her adult life. 

The girl needs therapy. There is something she’s not sharing with you all. And no one wants to be that over dramatic angry person, odds are she’s having trouble regulating her emotions because she never learned to cope with stress or something "
294,"&gt;she clearly is out of practice when it comes to being a friend so with more interaction she might be better in the future

I think deep down that you know this is never going to happen.  She doesn't think there's anything wrong with her behavior so why would she change?  She wasn't trying at all and that's a clear sign that she just doesn't care.

Her having no bridesmaids is entirely her fault.  You are not obligated to be friends with her or be her bridesmaids.  This is really harsh, but I wouldn't feel bad for someone that puts no effort into maintaining friendships or even pretends to care about other people.  "
295," &gt; he had good intentions

No, he didn’t. His intent was to disregard your wishes and feelings and there’s a big streak of seeming to know better than you to what you need and want. 

Keep your eye out; that sort of attitude doesn’t generally only pop up once. "
296,"&gt;it will kill your relationship

IMHO that's happened. If my fiancée was so oblivious of my distress as OP's fiancée is, I'd be out of there.  And I expect that if OP makes fiancée choose hom over her sister then his fiancée will think ""well fuck that guy"".

This is not OP and fiancee working as a team, it's become confrontational, a zero-sum game where someone loses"
297,"This is emotional abuse. He likes it when you're home doing nothing. He doesn't want you to have friends. He is controlling you with name-calling and undermining your self confidence with unwarranted shame. This is an excellent time to break up. Plus, he's physically violent with your cat which is totally unacceptable. I'd start figuring out how you're going to get out of there and make the leap ASAP"
298,"Agree. And document, document, document. Save voicemails, text messages, emails, receipts, anything that proves what's going on and how unstable he is.You hopefully won't need any of it, but if you do divorce and it goes to trial you'll may need all of it, especially if custody becomes an issue. I have a friend going through the same thing and he's got some old texts and emails from his ex that will likely make his life a lot easier."
299,"&gt; the guy who divorced his wife over a false allegation

Your wife is guilty of cheating. That's why you are divorcing her. And for me, this wouldn't even be a question, because let's be honest, if you don't, the rest of the faculty will think you condone her actions. That will play into any further career you have at this university, and quite possibly, any other. 

So if it was me, and anyone asked anything, I'd say I've retained a divorce attorney and leave it at that. Anyone with a lick of sense would pat you on the back and offer their support. "
300,"He didn't care enough to talk to you, to voice his feelings, and instead bottled them up and broke up with you out of the blue.

By breaking up with you out if the blue,and moving out then and there, without any previous discussion also put you at financial risk suddenly having many of your bills double out of nowhere.

He didnt even think about you in this at all. You weren't a factor in his decision, you don't even seem to be an afterthought... He simply didn't care and/or didn't respect you enough. He simply thought about, and cared about his own feelings.

As was said already, if he truely felt instant regret he wouldn't have waited till his ""Summer of Fun"" *ended* before contacting you, he woukd have done so almost immediately.

I dunno if I can agree with others saying he wanted to date/fk other women for a bit and when he failed, he came crawling back, but the alternatives aren't much better.

You deserve someone who can *actually* put you first, or think of how you are impacted by their actions, not pretend after the fact and say he feels this way, while clearly *showing* you otherwise. Don't take him by his words, take him by his actions. Don't take him back. Show yourself the respect that he clearly doesn't have for you."
301,"LOL your siblings have a broken normal meter and don't realize the severeness of your father's behaviour.


You don't owe that egoistic narcissistic man anything, just because he was involved in your creation.


Don't get financially entangled with this toxic person. If your siblings are stupid enough to help him oit, so be it. They can't force you to chip in.


Bizarre that you had to see your abuser regularly and now are asked to help out. "
302,"YEP.  Do this and then cook what you want to cook.  If you're doing 100% of the cooking and he won't give you ideas or help you at all, then he needs to be happy with whatever you choose to make.  I would never, in a million years, expect my spouse to cook me every meal, refuse to tell them what I'd like to eat, and then get upset about what they chose to make.  That's fucked up."
303,Also musical instruments and squirt guns. 
304,"It really seems like this is about way more than going to a funeral alone, because that seems like the perfect compromise under normal circumstances.

I have a feeling there's a history here between your mother/family and your wife that is playing into this and/or a history of your wife feeling you don't prioritize her. Is that part of what ""not doing super well"" is about?
"
305,"Bring your diary when you see her, pull it out, say ""we need to talk about this."" Show her the page and explain how you feel violated and appalled. If she tries to cut you off and argue, just walk away. Dont feed into it. 

You have every right to be upset!! That is a terrible, weird thing to do! She needs some help..."
306,"&gt;Should this be my time to be selfish and say no?

What on earth is selfish about telling him 'no'?

You really don't get to say that you ""immediately"" realized you'd made a mistake when you do something you planned for god knows how long. It's just not credible. It's extremely self-involved and selfish to approach someone you broke up with and tell them this nonsense. "
307,He was sentenced to 20 years for murder. There’s no getting her back and he knows that. 
308,"&gt;my department is around ~50 people, and as cliche as it sounds, we're definitely like a dysfunctional family.

What this translates to in practice is that your department is unprofessional, relying on an imbalance of power and younger employees who don’t yet know what a healthy workplace should look like. "

311,"If I have someone come over, who I've been seeing for 2 months and who will stay the night, I'm gonna make damn sure the sheets are fresh, the toilet is spotless, the carpet is clean, the dishes are done, I've opened the windows to make the place smell fresh and have a towel/toothbrush out for them to use. Anything else IMHO is pretty lazy/disrespectful/uncaring.

I would understand if you coming over was a spur of the moment decision and there wasn't time but this was planned...

Edit: and I want to point out that I'm not a clean freak at all. I generally don't fold my laundry, my desk is covered in stuff (because I cbf tidying it) and my bathroom isn't gross but it's not the cleanest either under normal circumstances. The point though, is that someone new coming over kicks me into gear because I want to impress them. "
312,"To me it sounds like he's tried playing the field, realised he's not exactly a hot commodity, and always assumed he'd have someone lined up before the divorce.

So of course now he realises there's a very good chance he'll end up alone and he starts trying to backpedal. 

(See also: Guys who open up their relationships because they assume they'll be drowning in women, suddenly find their partners are more popular than them and get upset)."
313,But he can go behind your back and spend $200 on food for only him? And it's clear by his reaction he has no intention of stopping.
314,"Your cousin sucks.  Your family is even more blind than she is.

She's been bullying you for years and you snapped.  That's exactly what happens, especially since everyone else does fuck-all about it. 


Stand your ground.  Don't let them push you around.  And because I'm super fucking petty I'd give a non apology ""I'm sorry you're such an awful human that I snapped when you were being a shit""


But don't take that non-apology advice, it's pretty bad.  "
315,This. And also don’t let her crawl back to you when she realizes he isn’t leaving his wife and child.
316,"&gt; They’re only friends now and I completely trust him

I don't."
317,"How remorseful do you think he can possibly be about pictures that he took when he was a teenager (meaning at least *six years ago*) and didn't delete? Pictures that he is still looking at?

You can't really be remorseful about a crime or moral transgression that you committed while continuing to benefit from having done it. It would be like if you found out the laptop you found the photos on was stolen 3 years ago, and he claims he feels remorseful about that too."
318,"Added to the fact she was only 19 and him already 34 when they started dating, girl just run. Or look forward to decades of paying this guy debt while he continues to screw his credit (and soon yours) to the ground. "
319,"Your friends are assholes, and are doing a bullshit typical ego trip at your expense.  You can find new ones; chances are these are people you went to high school with and are friends because of proximity and being forced to interact with them for years, right?  Real friends respect your wishes.

And since you say you grew up being shamed you are probably used to taking shit from your friends too and they feel like they can make kick you around for fun.  Not friends."
320,"Yeah, she ramped up the crazy as predicted. I'm so sorry you were sick, I'm sure it didn't make you feel any better to be trapped at home, unable to breathe AND worried she was going to just show up at your place. "
321,"Man, if this was the straw that finally broke the camel's back for your wife, I shudder to think what's buried in the rest of that pile."
322,"10 years ago a strange man took a creeper-shot of me. It still makes me sad to this day that he did that, because I wasn't asking to be added to someone's spank bank and it made me feel dehumanized.

He put his sexual pleasure above their basic rights to privacy. We could maybe debate about how his age at the time factors in... except he's still using their pictures, so that point is moot. He still thinks that it's more important that he gets off than anything else, apparently. "
323,"Time to cut him out. He’s still saying these hurtful things willingly, even if it’s only to placate his wife. "
324,"Honestly? It sounds like your parents don't know how to handle the transition from child-parent to adult offspring-parent bond and they've managed to screw this up in a pretty spectacular fashion. So, where there would be a natural progression that generally has some milestones (high school graduation, college graduation, first real job, living on your own, marriage, etc.) along the way? They're only progressing at those milestones. 

It would make sense that, over time, you may choose to stop going on every road trip. Family dinners wouldn't be every week but every other week or when it's comfortable for both sides. That's gaining distance because you're making room for your own traditions as a family with your husband and your kids. You may want to visit his family or take separate vacations some years. That, however, doesn't happen all at once. It's something that's flexible and gentle if you're a very close knit family that's loving and supportive. Right now, you're living the equivalent of a snapped rubber band. So, talk to your parents to see if you can try and understand why they felt the need to handle the transition in this way and if they intend to keep the distance at this level. 

Oh, and if you want to stop your brother from making comments like that to anyone else? There's one way of pointing out the error in his logic. The next time you talk to him, point out that your sister might want to get married someday. That would leave him as the last (maiden name) standing. So, when your parents need help in their old age? When they need care, some place to live, someone to help them with all the ignoble and gross things that can occur as you grow infirm? He'll be the one taking care of all of it. "
325,"Then take your $12K and walk away.  You could have invested that money in a retirement fund, fixed your car, bought new clothes, etc.  All the things you thought you couldn't do financially, you could've done if he hadn't broken your trust like this.  If this were me, there would be no coming back from this.  For all you know he could've been keeping that money for himself and only said it was a ""surprise gift"" after you caught him."
326,"I don’t know if this has been said but if so it bears repeating- file for emergency custody first.  Before you do anything else.  Also collect all papers (birth certificates and social security cards are a MUST) and store them at an outside location, like your parents.  Take out exactly half of your bank account and store it separately or open another account that does not have his name on it.  Have a go-bag packed with essentials, which include a copy of your child’s favorite lovey or security objects just in case you can’t return home.  Keep this bag in your car or at your parents.  Keep your cell locked and on you at all times, ditto for your car keys.  Keep your car locked so he can’t do something to the engine to prevent you from leaving (you can drive for a short while on slashed tires.  It’s not great for your rims but you can do it).  

If possible don’t leave him alone with the baby until you’ve gotten all your ducks quacking along nicely.  

And you seem like a strong person, capable of handling yourself.  You’ve been through enough, now it’s ok to want to be happy and comfortable.  You don’t owe this guy your life.  You don’t owe this guy your child’s life.  Leave.  Be happy."
327,Dump her. I don't care that this subreddit gets shit for suggesting leaving someone as the first option. She is a bad partner and you should leave her. 
328,"People have love languages and his is gifting. He shows his love by giving gifts. Google love languages.


Why do his gifts bother you? Do you feel he’s showing off? Trying to control you? Make you indebted? Do some homework to nail down.


Realize though, just as some people show love through cooking and to turn away their pie would be very hurtful, your brother is more than likely expressing himself through these gifts. Make sure to acknowledge the good feeling and place these gifts are coming from so that he doesn’t feel rejected."
329,"Everyone needs therapy - but someone really needs to check on Anne, specifically. Having all this happen when you're 10 has to be confusing as hell. You want everyone to be happy, you can't really do much, people are pushing you and hitting you, and when you try to help your sister feel better - your mom winds up hitting her (in your defense, but still). What did you do wrong? Etc.

She needs to know she is loved and that you don't approve of what's happened to her and that what happened between her sister and her mom was not her fault."
330,"&gt; She sent me a long text last night, telling me I was throwing away 20 years over a simple mistake and that she needs me, I'm her only friend. I sent her a reply that said, ""No, you threw away 20 years by bringing him into my home."" 

10/10, A++, full marks. You've modelled a perfect way to handle this situation. I'm just sorry you had to deal with it at all. "
331,"I think a good first step would be to stop moving back and forth out of your own house. Let your fiancé do it by herself if she wants to do that.

As for the rest... I don't know, but you can't marry into this. Either find a solution or don't get married."
332,"Leaching on the top comment so OP sees this. 

Do not be deceived by him taking the news well either. It can be easy to let your guard down if he seems to be cooperating. 

Do not do that. Be smart and be calculating. "
333,"This is the perfect response OP. I would also advice to go to a lawyer yesterday and then set up a meeting with a therapist. You won't get answers (or closure) from your wife, you have to come to terms with her lies on your own. "
334,"Yup. Let me be clear here: you are going through hell and she is showing you her ass. Let the trash take itself out. Girl, bye. "
335,"Someday, someone is going to try and hock that shit and it’ll be really embarrassing for all involved. "
336,"I’m guessing he was never going to tell you and the “saving for you” story only came out because he was caught.  

I’d have a hard time continuing in this relationship. This is a major deceit. To be fair, even though his parents own the house , it WOULD be reasonable if they wanted to charge rent, but it seems he was just taken no advantage of the situation. It would be an entirely different story if he was up front with you in the beginning and said something like “ Mom and dad own this house and want to charge x dollars for rent” or even, mom and dad own this house and don’t want rent, but I’m uncomfortable with that and want us to pay them x amount”. But he just flat out lied and took your money. "
337,Well maybe if he stood up for you and wasn't judgemental you'd want to move in with him
338,"DUMP HIM, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. YOU DUMP HIM AND MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE. "
339,"I listened to a great Dan savage podcast that tackled this issue.

His advice was to take sex off the table completely, but take time to reconnect with each other as sexual adults. Massage each other, naked cuddling, whatever foreplay you're both into. The idea is that you're given the opportunity to rediscover yourself as a sexual being without feeling that something is ""expected"" of you by the end of it. If p.i.v sex isn't there as the necessary end result you are free to relax and get turned on naturally, which might take a few sessions. 

This can come in tandem with date nights, having time to yourself to do the type of date night ""rituals"" like getting ready and making yourself look and feel like a desirable woman as opposed to being in ""mom mode"". I really wish I knew the link to the episode for you. Your husband sounds really sweet and understanding, so hopefully when you talk about this he'll be on board (after the session he can always go take care of himself, or you can both try mutual masturbation as a way to feel intimate and sexual without you having to ""psych yourself up"" to intercourse before you're really comfortable with it).

Hopefully, this will lead to you just being able to lose yourself in the moment - as opposed to when he gave you that foot massage and you couldn't really just take the time to enjoy his touch and affection. Instead your mind was skipping forward to what you thought might be coming next, so you couldn't really just bask in the intimacy of that moment between a husband and wife."
340,"Part of establishing boundaries is walking away when the other violates your terms.  Easy to type out, hard to do"
341,"Hey I am sorry you are going through this.

Thing is that some ppl just cant deal with kids and caring for them and it seems your ex is that way. 

Yes this hurts you are in love but you guys arent compatible. I think give yourself time. Block her on social media and when you feel a bit better go back to the dating pool yourself."
342,"You're asking how to deal with this tomorrow, so: 

&gt;I have an opportunity to deal with this tomorrow. All four of us (me, f, sister, bf) will be at her house tomorrow.

Nope. You won't be there tomorrow. Your fiancée can go, but you're staying home. After you tell her that this is not sustainable and can't happen anymore. It is NOT sorting itself out. It IS affecting your work. And your sex life! You guys need to establish new boundaries today. Before any wedding. If you aren't being heard and supported, you have an entire new conversation on your hands, on which deposits you can get back for the wedding. This is NOT healthy for any of you. 

The good news is that if you can your fiancée on Team Bananas, you can actually get yourselves out of this stupid arrangement. I would tell Sister that fiancée will spend ONE night a week at the house (without you) and ZERO nights at yours. Sister will freak the eff out, it will be the end of the world and histrionics, but if you two stand firm, you will be amazed how quickly she gets used to it. One night is already generous as hell. And if you like having a bit of alone time to do whatever you like, cool. Lightyears better than the status quo. 

But you have to stand totally firm. This arrangement is over as of today. A 28yo woman can live alone. If her anxiety is that bad, therapy. But this is no longer your problem. "
343,"&gt; because she found out that he solicited a prostitute from Craigslist and she was disgusted by it.

So, not because SHE is married, or HE is married, but because he got sex from a 3rd place?  That's freaking laughable.

Also, choosing to go to a hotel room to have sex doesn't ""just happen"".  Flirting over text, maybe that just happens.  A passionate one night stand?  Maybe that just happens.  But an every day good morning kiss, and dates at places YOU want to go, doesn't ""just happen"".

I'd be done.  I think you should take some time and decide what you want.  You sound like you don't want to lose her because of what you HAD... but even if you manage to move forward with her, what you HAD is gone. It will forever be different. Do you want life with her, but different?"
344,"So from looking through your post history, this is the least of your worries. He's cheated on you twice in the past, you think he's cheating on you now, his family hates you, he insults your leg tattoo and **you're thinking of marrying him????**

You need to stop wedding planning right now and really re-evaluate this relationship. "
345,"And I just noticed this: 

&gt;But his behaviour recently escalated.

Again, it sounds like he went from pot to heroin. OP, you gotta remember that although you and family were victims in this accident, Brother might be feeling pretty helpless and scared. One of your kids was in the hospital overnight. He might be ""escalating"" because he could have lost a whole chunk of his family. I'm not trying to make your pain all about him, but we don't live in a vacuum. He loves you guys. I don't think throwing money at people is the answer, but he might have been thinking, 'almost lost family, must have control over something. will buy big vehicle to keep them safe.' 

Also, maybe tell Brother to throw some money at a drunk driving charity/foundation?"
346,"You're so busy living day by day, fighting problem by problem, you haven't had a moment to pull back and take a widescreen view of this relationship. The issues you present here all point to very large relationship incompatibilities. Love is not enough. I suggest you go block by block and evaluate this whole relationship, your partnership skills, mutual communication skills, financial compatibility and so on. 

There more problems here than you are telling us about. And you're going to need to decide if he's even capable of working on them. If not, before kids entered the equation, you need to give some serious thought to the lifetime viability of this relationship.

"
347,"If they won’t take the baby back, then place it on the floor near its parent and leave the room. If they won’t come back into the room where the kids are when you’re done, tell the parent you’re leaving the house, and follow through with it.

The issue here is that you’re trying to set boundaries verbally, but you’re not following through with action, so you’re letting your siblings trample all over those boundaries. Once you’ve set a boundary, you need to enforce it, or else it’s not a boundary at all."
348,"There is a difference between a guy who isn't very complimentary and needs to be coaxed into voicing his opinions or being reassuring, and a guy who actively says negative things about you and talks about how hot other girls are to you. 
This guy is a POS. He said mean things about you, caused you to cry AND said you looked ugly while crying. Run, run away. "
349,"&gt; we’re trying for a baby etc... I’ve been thinking about breaking up, but the situation is so complicated....

You are making things more complicated than they really are. Or, rather your emotions are. 

Follow these steps in this order:

1. Stop having sex.

2. Read your lease and come to an understanding about your obligations, when they end, and so on. 

3. Move out. If you have lease obligations and can't afford 2 places, see if you can stay with your parents until the end of the lease.

4. Break up with him after you are out. He's an abuser. Most domestic violence / murders happen when an abuser knows you are leaving. Google the statistics on that. You don't owe him a conversation that exposes you to more violence. You do, however, owe it to yourself, and everyone who loves you, to make smart decisions on protecting yourself. So, just leave, talk comes when you are safely away."
350,"And even if this wasn't with a student: ""I cheated on you, but it was consensual!"""
351,"So, I was in a similar situation, my father died suddenly and I had crappy teeth. What I'd recommend is getting dental insurance, and starting on fixing your teeth, while also setting money aside for your father's stone. Take the time to decide with your family what you want, gather the deposit, etc. I recommend getting started with the teeth, though, because your smile is important, too. I was ashamed of my teeth, and how bad I let them get, so I wasn't smiling with my teeth showing, etc. Maybe I'm projecting, but I would sit down with your fiance, and see how both goals can be achieved. It shouldn't be one or the other, in my mind, both are important, for your physical and mental health. My condolences for the loss of your father, it sucks and it hurts. But you and yours are the most important memorial to him, don't forget that. "
352,"Ew he’s asking for blow jobs while sitting in his ass doing nothing for you or baby?

He should have been a blow job. What a waste of space. Some practical stuff - if you can afford it? Get a cleaner, have friends or relatives come round.

With your husband, tell him. Calmly and clearly that if he doesn’t start fucking being a father to this baby he’s going to have to move out, because there’s room for only one baby in the house at a time. What an absolute disgrace of a person "
353,"Does she have any space in the apartment? You have (had) an office and a man cave. What’s her room? Isn’t it now both of your apartment, if she lives with you? It does seem like you view her as a guest in your home. Not that there shouldn’t be discussion over changing things drastically, but your phrasing and the fact that you have two rooms that are “you-only”, and consider it to be your place, is odd. "
354,You're right.

359,"All I can say is that your relationship/friendship with Zac is incredibly unhealthy on so many levels. At many points, it is abusive. It sounds like your boyfriend knows all of this and dislikes that, but doesnt want to be seen as the 'bad guy' by telling you to sever that ""bond"" (read: toxic codependency) between you two."
360,Giant no you need to have a discussion with your wife when you are both feeling calm. Does anybody in her family have issues with debt or credit card fraud?
361,"&gt;1) you can’t prepare her. She won’t be prepared. It will be awful, she will be wracked with grief, and that’s how it is. She will, hopefully and in due time, get to a better place.

You can't be fully prepared, but having had relatives dying over a long period of time and had my father die unexpectedly overnight, I think there are definitely some small things you can do to remove any extra stress when the time comes. Things like making sure any will is up to date, putting all finances are in order, knowing the location of any important paperwork, knowing if they had any particular wishes for their funeral etc."
362,Nothing strange or weird imo. The dude just likes to help and support his family. 
363,Maybe see a sex therapist? It will help you work out your feelings and might help you guys communicate or figure out why your wife feels this way.
364,"&gt; I'm worried that now it's only because I have the means and drive to finally leave that he's even contemplating making an effort. 

Bingo. 

He knew how you felt. He knew he had the resources to address it. He didn’t care. Only now, when *his* standard of living is being threatened, does he suddenly have some motivation to work on your relationship. But it’s *still* not because he cares about you - he’s trying to save himself the inconvenience of a divorce. 

It’s a classic case of too little, too late. If this is him being “motivated”, you’ll be twice as miserable when the panic wears off and the apathy sets in again. Mental illness or no, this man is simply not able to be a reliable partner right now. I support spouses carrying each other through hard times and low periods, but the struggling partner needs to *actually struggle* to improve the situation and ensure that it doesn’t last forever. There needs to be a light at the end of the tunnel, and with your husband, it just isn’t there. This is who he is and who he’s comfortable being. "
365,"&gt;""He  immediately pulled it out and was like ""what the hell is this? Are you  seriously carrying a bear around?"" and then he pulled it out and made  fun of it saying ""look what I still found! She's carrying a teddy  bear!!""

​

What?! This seems like a really strange reaction to finding a stuffed animal in someone's belongings. How did he know it wasn't a gift that you were giving a young niece or nephew later that day? Or something you had received from your SO earlier that day? Or won at a crane game? Or a million other reasons. I have a hard time seeing how this came about.

Regardless, your lab group mates sound like jerks and I would avoid interacting with the ones that made the comments as much as possible in the future. There is nothing wrong with the way you are coping. I am sorry for your loss."
366,"Everything you said here is perfect. I'd just like to also commend OP on her strength to be back in class so quickly. You do whatever helps get you through this, lady (unless it's unhealthy, and this is far from unhealthy). I barely left bed for *weeks* after my sister's mom died. To be up and about and buckling down on school is strength, no matter which way you look at it. You're gonna make a great nurse, /u/ThisButterfly3."

370,"I wonder why there are enough groups of single men that enjoy having a woman around to tell them what to do that there is actually a number of common terms to describe these women. To me, it reminds me of a group of lost boys looking for a mother figure."
371,It sounds like your boyfriend sees through Zac's manipulative bullshit and you don't.
372,"Holy shit, she needs to say this exactly. What a douchebag."
373,"By ""good attitude"" he probably means ""the type of attitude that doesn't result in making a post on a relationship advice forum about an innocuous comment my boyfriend made."""
374,"&gt; She mentions in invites “no gfs” or the like, so it’s her and all the boys.

This woman sounds like a nightmare, but I agree she's not really the main issue. If all ""the boys""(including bf) bend to her will, they've tacitly agreed with her being in charge. She's basically saying to your bf, it's OP or me, and it doesn't look good for OP."

Would help to ask him *why* he cropped it too."
376,I would guess your brother is grieving and is terrified of losing you too. It's not rational so I don't know if it's something that can be easily remedied. Assaulting you is absolutely not OK though. Maybe you could try writing him a letter and giving him some time to come to terms with it?

378,"Dear Crazy Former Friend,

I realized after the bachelorette party that we've drifted far apart from the friendship we used to have.  I feel like you should have people in your wedding that know you and support you in your life.  

Therefore, I am respectfully bowing out of your wedding so you can include someone with whom you are closer.  

Send.  Block.  The End."
379,"&gt;I don't think he wiped very thoroughly, and it had dried in the crack

Ewwwww no girl, I'm pretty sure you can do much better than this. Everything else was bad already but there's no way you should put up with this on the regular. This all might be related to his mental health but if he is not actively working to make it better then it won't. Don't waste your time. "
380,"Ok fineee. 

My girlfriend and I met freshman year of college in the spring. I remember I was on my way to multivariable calc and I was walking with my hands in my pockets. This really beautiful girl, like the turn-your-head as they pass you type of girl, was walking towards me from the other direction. So when she passed me, I turned my head to keep looking at her and ended up tripping over an uneven part on the sidewalk. Because my hands were in my pockets, I wasn't able to save myself from falling so yes, I fell. She heard the fall and I think I yelped, so she turned around and rushed back to help me. 


And the rest is history. "
381,"This man is in his FIFTIES!?????? First of all he should be happy you brought him anything back. To go around and complain to others that you gave Brian the same number of snacks is OBSCENE. You are an adult. You can give whoever you want whatever you want. He is an entitled brat. 

Reminds me of the fat cousin in Harry Potter who screamed about getting one less birthday presents than the year prior. 

Idk what you should do but he’s in the wrong not you.  "
382,You are a second choice.  Tell him absolutely not and block his number.  Go find someone excited to make you his first choice.
383,"&gt; He insists we still talk like normal everyday and hang out. 

I mean, who the hell cares what he insists and what he wants? He dumped you, you are not in a relationship, so his wants and feelings are not your problem. Take a break from this dude and go meet someone that doesn't treat you like a benchwarmer."
384,"Exactly. Back then any disagreement we had was somehow made to be my fault and it was usually framed by my ex as ""Well you've been through a lot so of course you're a mess. You need to do \[a\], \[b\] and \[c\] to get better."" I.e. I was constantly trying to ""fix"" myself to get her approval. Sarah was charismatic and absolutely amazing at wordplay and could talk her way into or out of any situation. It was a lot of work to forgive myself for staying in that relationship for so long. "
385,[deleted]
386,"Oh girl no.  You are not over-reacting, he's being a thoughtless shit (at best).  And, more importantly, you're not going to feel ok until you and he have a conversation about this. It's not an admission of weakness to tell him that what he's doing is making you feel like crap. "
387,"I’m so sorry for your loss.

A very similar thing happened to me about twenty years ago. The only differences were that I was younger than you are now, and we knew about the pregnancy just before he died. Our son graduated from college recently. He is an amazing, thoughtful, compassionate young man who looks just like his father. 

I also wondered a hundred or so times along the way if I’d made the right choice. There is no wrong decision. If you want to chat with someone who can relate, feel free to message me. "
388,"&gt; as it was a last minute invite.

389,"""Oh, you're 2 now? Time to learn the recorder!"" "
390,"&gt; she found a job that easily after going that long without a job?

This is what pissed me off the most reading everything.... She was able to pack up and leave, then find a steady job?! 

OP, she didn't have a job for 4 YEARS. Can we just let that sink in? You dodged a bullet, ignore her, and move on for yourself. "
391,"Yeah anyone saying it’s not so bad or that you need to compromise more isnt getting it. 

The dinner thing, shows he cares for himself and doesn’t check in with you. He’s happy to watch you make a dinner he has no intention of eating. It just illustrates how he separates himself. It’s a petty example that illustrates the bigger issues here; he is inconsiderate, doesn’t help contribute and doesn’t make a real attempt to do anything as a family. You’re expected to be mom and he can do as he likes. 

The man is unkind and honestly, a really poor father. You have someone coming to talk about development once a month. Did you hire them or was this...suggested?? The fact that he leaves the room is appalling.  He’s a father and this is his job. 

Leave. The man is not interested in being a husband or, it seems, a father. Talk to a lawyer before you do anything else. "
392,"It's something of a truism that men are less attuned to random stranger danger because, in general, we don't have to be.  Like, if I come home and forgot I left a window open, I shut it. Some of my female friends will sweep the house (look behind the shower curtain, etc) with a knife in their hand before they can relax. 

You shouldn't let him talk you out of trusting your gut. 

I think it's a case of him simply not understanding how dangerous the world is. Chances are none of his male friends have been stalked by someone who could easily overpower them. Chances are none of them have been raped as adults. Chances are none of them have been put in clear physical danger by someone they trusted. 

But I'm willing, in addition your own experiences, you have a dozen female friends who one of the above has happened to. At least. 

So you need to be very clear to him that he can take his claim that you're ""irrational"" and shove it. There's a side of the world he doesn't see, because most men don't see it until women have pointed it out to them a couple of times. 

You don't have an obligation to be polite to men in a situation where you feel safest leaving. A lot of bad shit happens to women because of that social pressure to be polite. 

Explain all this to him. If he's not at least making an attempt to be empathetic, if you continues to treat you like you're being irrational, then consider finding a new boyfriend.

398,"&gt;He then got angry again and raised his hand at me. I flinched and was genuinely scared of him in that moment.


This is not a relationship you want.  




That's how simple it is. No ""but I love him!!"". That doesn't matter, I'm sure you love him but he raised his hand at you to make you afraid of him.


This will only get worse. 



He literally threatened to beat you, let that sink in. Don't make this ""But he didn't touch me!"". No.. But he deliberately made you think he would. 



That's horrible. And anyone who would do that would eventually escalate to beating you. Because threatening won't work forever. "

Though one final come-to-Jesus talk is possibly warranted, basically you could say ""we are not getting married until we talk through X, Y and Z. You let me know when you are ready to talk.""

Then every time she mentions marriage you can say that it's up to her to start the conversations that you need to have. It throws the onus off you, the ball is in her court.

Then for your sake, if nothing changes, set an exit date.

Good luck, OP, you sound worn out. "
408,"Your compromise is that you'll cut back on the things he doesn't like but he will continue to do everything he likes, right? "

410,"Holy hell. Your auntie seems To be on the crazy train. I’ll start by saying I’m sorry that this is happening. Have you guys considered getting a zero interest credit card? This may help in securing an Airbnb for the short term while you wait for the apartment to come through. It will also allow for you to have delayed payments with zero interest for some time while you get on your feet. You can then make payments on what you used once you are settled into your new place. 

Also if you get a uhaul to move your furniture and things, most will offer 1 month free storage to keep your belongs while in tranisition so you don’t lose your furniture in the middle of this ordeal. "

412,"If someone gave me a present I thought was worth 3 grand I would feel quite overwhelmed and guilty. I would feel indebted to them and would either spend money I didn't have trying to get them a gift of value in return or feel shit and cheap for not being able to. I'm not exactly poor, but a 3k gift is too much. 

It's manipulative and you need to put your foot down. The gift is just about making your wife look good without any thought about what the sister might want of what a pricy gift might do to your relationship with her. Plus it's simply rude to lie to your close family for no good reason. "
413,"Yes! And it also helps if you ask her to repeat herself so she has to say it twice. I have a coworker that is a total jerk and makes these snide comments all the time hoping to get a reaction so that he can play the victim. So now, I ask him to repeat when he said and then his little slide-in comments seem much more deliberate and obvious."
414,"Retail sucks and is hard work, it’s certainly not a Beverly Hills wife sort of lifestyle. There’s plenty of office jobs that are much easier.

This sounds like this is about her needing flexible hours and less than 40 hours a work week to have time to parent.

Op if you expect you wife to go back to full time have you worked out how child care/home maintenance will be divided?

- what hours is daycare available? Does that cover her full office working day?

- who will drop the kid off and pick up after a long day at work? Do either of you ever need to stay late?

- Who is cooking dinner now? Who will do so when she returns to work?

- Who feeds and baths the baby now? Who will do it once she is working, *and* how will that fit into morning &amp; evening routines? For example: will you need to get up even earlier to feed your child breakfast before heading to work.

- if the child is sick - which parent will stay home from work that day.  Also, who will leave work to pick up a sick kid midday from daycare to the detriment to their career?

- who will take the child to scheduled doctors appointments? 


I would guess this is more about her concerned with practicality and the difficult logistics of being a working parent. Do you think she may be worried that all the tasks will fall on her shoulders?"

That means she’d have to navigate 4 busses to get to you from the airport in a brand new country where she doesn’t speak the language well. You call her manipulative, but other than the one example that she wanted you to pick her up from the airport, what are examples of her mooching and manipulating you?

If it's not? Well... they gained access under false pretenses. They physically assaulted you (unwanted contact that did not stop when you wanted it to is technically that). They are now attempting to emotionally blackmail you. I'm pretty sure that, if you put it that way, any social worker will likely see your side of things."

Discussing your husband's boundaries with MIL was not good.  She doesn't get a vote on that, you should never have mentioned it before it was settled with your husband.  You can't be triangulating marital decisions through a third party.  

That's fundamentally the problem here.  Your husband has made his parents part of your marriage, and isn't able/willing to stand up for himself.  Throw in manipulative in-laws and you have a problem.


I'd go to war with your husband over this.  He needs to grow a backbone, and can't do it by always making you the bad guy to Mommy.   

Also, stop worrying too much about being nice with MIL.  Be civil, but she's clearly willing to manipulate and you don't need to keep the gloves on while fighting back.   
"
425,"First, this isn’t about the girl’s intentions. Since no one knows her intentions, it’s actually about your boyfriend and his intentions.

Second, two contradictory statements from your boyfriend:

a. | it's extremely rare for me to meet someone random from my country here in the US

b. I don't care about people from my country in general”

Sentence (a) implies that he would be excited to meet anyone from his country, since it’s a rare event. Sentence (b) implies that he’s not interested in meeting just anyone from his country. Sentence b follows a. He’s narrowing down why he wants to meet her. She’s special in some way, most people from his country aren’t. Okay.

Next:

| \[telling her in advance that it’s not a date\] I don't see why that would be necessary.

It’s not necessary.  It’s called respect and courtesy toward your girlfriends feelings and requests when it comes to other women. It’s solid proof that your gf has a special place- a pre-eminent spot above other girls in your heart. Telling her it’s not a date in advance also tells the other girl how much your gf means to you. It also tells the other girl that friendship is the reason- the only reason you’re meeting- you’re setting your gf ahead of any other girl proves this. Who cares what another girl thinks since you’re so in love with your gf. The other girl will understand completely.

| it's not a date when, the way I see it, someone just invited me to share some stories and talk

Since it’s not a date there should be no problem if a friend or “friends” tag along to ""share stories and talk"", even your gf.  There is no need for privacy between friends. Privacy is for private expressions.

It's likely there is a personal interest in the other girl and vice versa because he is setting up a special circumstance and then denying it exists."

Put another way, if you found a far less expensive option for school, would it provide you with the education to get the jobs you want to do? A masters is fun, but it’s not a ticket to anything. "
428,"Does she not have... things to do in her life? While it might seem like social media involves people in anothers life, it seems like it's taken over her side a bit much. Nothing wrong with distancing yourself a bit and telling her to find a new hobby. 

If she involves your parents (holy crap, she's nearly retirement age that's wayyyyy too old to tell on a sibling she could've been a parent to and are your parents even on social media?), you can use that argument: ""i'm worried about Stepsister, she seems to be too social media obsessed"".  "
429,"It sounds like to me it did happen, but she may have mistaken your cousin for the person who did it. It's so, so, so incredibly common for us to mistake people. Like someone mentioned below, especially in sexual assaults. Minds can get foggy and replace faces with others; think we saw someone we didn't etc. Combine that with alcohol (if she had been drinking), knowledge that your cousin was currently around the city, someone who could have resembled him and the fact that she doesn't know him well/see him often and she could have easily have mistaken a stranger for your cousin. Now, she could feel confused and embarrassed and is trying to process HOW she got the person wrong and doesn't feel enough trust(?) possibly to open up to you about it because she already feels like she got it wrong once.

It could also be that she's lying, but why? It seems much more likely that she confused him with someone else. She's not lying. Her tears are real. Her story is real. It's just that a key element of the story has been mistaken."

If you weren’t in the class, and his cheating had no effect on you whatsoever, would you still feel the same way about his cheating?

Honestly, it’s one thing to write answers on your hand to cheat, and an entirely different thing to hack a professor’s computer to steal the exams.  He &amp; his friend fucked over the entire class doing this as well so the consequences are even more far reaching.

I would probably break up with him, if it were me, based in part on ALL of the reasons above.   "

The way my husband and I do it is every income goes into the joint account, all necessities come out of the joint (bills, groceries, car payments) and then we each get $100 allowance each week that we can waste on ""wants"". If we want fast food,  if we wants clothes or unnecessary cosmetics. 

If there are larger purchases we want outside of the $100, we discuss buying it and get approval from each other. 

This prevents impulse buying as you have to manage how wasteful you are with your $100."
456,"My response to this post is entirely contingent upon whether your 'office and man cave' were one room or two.

If you wanted to have two entire rooms to yourself in an apartment you're sharing with her that's hers too, man, get over yourself."
457,"Ask her if you can take her to lunch.  If she is unable to go, try to make another date with just her. Do this in order to ascertain if he ""lets"" her do things without him, supports her relationships,  or if he tries to isolate her from her friends and family.  If she goes with you, ask her how it is going.  You can ask her outright if he is kind to her/ safe. Whether she does or does not go out with you, make it very clear that you are always there for her if she ever needs you, no matter what the reason. "
458,"Taking care of the children is a job, and he stole your gift. He sounds incredibly manipulative and abusive."
459,"Fuuuck that.  She cleaned out your bank account while leaving without a word while you had a ~10 year old to take care of? 

Walk away man,  you deserve way better. I know it seems hard and confusing but she is a user, she used you until she decided she was done with you, and then still found a way to use you for what she wanted.   Block her everywhere,  don't engage,   write off what ever money you've given as a learning experience.  

Find a councillor that can you go to once in a while just to talk through you feelings and get some guidance, I did this around the time i split with my ex and it was a huge help.

460,"I thought the same thing. You ""tolerate"" your brother being nice and helping out his family?"
461,"I'm sorry this is happening, I know what it is like to be in your shoes.  I will do you the favor of not sugar coating what is going on or tell you what you want to hear.

1.  This isn't your fault.  This has nothing to do with anything you have done/said or not done/said. 

2.  This wasn't a mistake on your wife's part.  This was the result of a very long series of actions and decisions.

3.  She didn't confess.  She was caught.  She trickle truthed you until she got to a place of 'truthfulness' that you were satisfied with.  Unless you have access to her texts/emails with this guy or talk to him or compare notes with his wife you will never know the truth.  It isn't in your wife's best interest to tell you the whole truth.

4.   Your wife is a skilled liar.  She has looked you in the eye and told you worked late how many times?

5.  Not content with putting her marriage and her husbands health at risk by having an affair she happily inserted herself in another woman's marriage thus putting that wifes marriage and health at risk.   Think about that one for a minute.   Does that sound like something a person with empathy would or could ever do?

6.  She was not rejecting that guy when caught.  If so, she would have been happy to show you the texts of her telling him to leave her alone.

7.  She doesn't think it's necessary to change jobs?   That they can work together professionally from here on out?  Does that sound like it jibes with her story of him begging for another shot at her?

8.  Tell the wife.   If it blows up his life so be it.  If he gets mad at your wife and *really* breaks up with her then so be it.   This is the consequences of that guy deciding to have an affair.   That it would make you happy does not in any way negate the appropriateness and morality of telling her.   They have one kid - maybe she needs to know before she decides have another with him?  Before she decides to quit her job or stop her education?   

9.   Can you save your marriage?  Doubtful.  You can try - I would advise marital counseling and individual counseling.  I would recommend drawing up a very hard line Post Nup with severe penalties for cheating.  That would protect you if she signs it.  If she doesn't well, that tells you what you need to know.

10   If you divorce - which I would advice - bear in mind she is a liar and a manipulator.   She is selfish and is entitled.  It's what cheaters are and it is what cheaters do.   Be prepared for her to go after every penny.

To sum it up - tell the wife!   Not telling the wife is only benefitting your wife and her OM.  Telling the wife will benefit the other victim in this mess.

463,"To test if she likes you or just your brother, I would stop inviting her over and if she suggests a sleepover, insist on doing it at her house or at your place only when your brother isn't home. You'll figure out pretty quickly if she likes you or if she is only using you for access to your brother. As for your brother, I would discuss his behavior directly with him and possibly your parents."
464,"In addition to that, I think it's totally reasonable to not want someone that may not even be around in a month to wind up in your wedding photos. "
465,"This is awful for you and your family. But one thing I want to add is that your mom isn’t trying to play “happy family “ by going to the beach or taking you for ice cream. She’s trying to just have some time not thinking about what her son has done. Be kind to each other. 

I hope you can get family counseling for this and heal in whatever form that takes. "

471,"Not only is it crazy that your bil would offer up your house to strangers without permission, I think it's also crazy that 10 people expect free accommodations from somebody they've never met. Like what? This whole situation is absurd.

How far are they coming from? Can't they just drive in, do the thing, and leave? Kate also has the option to change the date of her opening to the next week when there's not a convention in town, and the hotels aren't booked! 

It's definitely putting you in a weird position which is unfair, but it's really not your problem. This should be a good lesson on etiquette for your bil."

The whole thing is still strange though. If I wasn't too invested I'd have no problem ending a relationship based off of those friends alone."

475,"One time a girl asked my ex to go to the movies. He insisted it wasn’t a date, they were just both very into film. Another friend and I ended up tagging along to see the movie. It was very obvious the girl was shocked that I was there, and had thought it was a date. Guys can be oblivious, and I trusted my ex really thought they both had friendly intentions. However, it’s safest to make sure intentions are clear before meeting up. If you truly love your gf, you will make her feel safe and confident by putting her first and telling this other girl you have a gf. If it makes her uncomfortable, it’s likely because she thought it was a date...in which case it’s *extra* important to tell her. "
476,"He had the number saved on his phone. He's outright lying to you. You are seriously delusional if you believe one word coming out of his mouth. This is literal red-handed proof. I understand the want to not believe it, but not only did he lie to you, but he's attempting to gaslight you.

I went through this (so when I say delusional, it's really not in a judgmental manner, I get it). If there's no immediate remorse, it won't get better. I dragged it out because we had just gotten married and wanted to give it a fight (my parents also put down tons of money for the wedding :( ), but if he's trying to convince you that it didn't happen instead of immediately putting everything on the table, he won't actually be sorry in the future. He'll just string you along with just enough of ""guilt"" to make it seem like he's making progress.

Don't be me. Get out."
477,"I’m in a super similar situation with my boyfriend. He doesn’t drive either, and neither do multiple of our friends. I’ve instituted a “no license, no opinion” policy in my car, and if you don’t like it you can take the damn bus! "

480,"Yeah, she's doing emotional loan sharking. Or maybe it's just plain financial loan sharking with an emotional component.

""Oh no, I wouldn't want you to pay me back for the wedding! I would rather just hold it over your heads forever, and use it as a guilt trip so that you end up loaning me small amounts of money forever, which will add up to much more in total over the years."""

483,"My grandmother, in her 70s, is one of those people who look 40. She's stunning, has been so her whole life, and dresses beautifully. She's also 10 years older than my grandfather. And for their whole relationship he's heard, ""wow, you have such a young wife."" For some reason, he doesn't like that comment. :) But, it to the point of hilarity, it's so frequent. 

So, my point is, I've been seeing this for over 30 years. There is no ""compromise."" You need to dress yourself the way you want, conduct yourself the way you want, and people are going to be people. You will never control the worlds reaction to you. 

He's going to have to find a place of acceptance. Not the space where he deals with something he doesn't like, a negative resignation. No, he needs to truly grow out of these feelings. 

He needs to either be nonplussed or happy that he has you. He's got to figure it out. But, I think that you trying to compromise inhibit the self growth needed here. He needs to cook a little bit longer until this has boiled off and he's happy. Side note: figure out if he's insecure about you leaving. If that's it, oh boy, that's a big bear to attack. I hope that's not it, my husband thinks it is though. "

....keep your mouth shut. Don’t say a word to anyone in the family. Spill it to a close friend or a therapist if you feel like you’re gonna explode, but *do not out yourself* like this. Your safety trumps your cousin’s right to the truth here. And with infidelity mixed into the homophobic powder keg, you’ve got a very volatile mix that needs to stay tightly sealed. 

Don’t reach out to him. You owe him nothing. Distance yourself from your cousin as subtly as possible. And take this to the grave.

486,"This sounds like my friends husband and it’s because he’s constantly high. They’ve lost dinner reservations, to having to pay for counselling appointments they didn’t attend because they were that late. 

It’s really rude of people to be constantly late to everything, especially formal appointments or work events. 

There’s more leeway with causal meetings especially when others know you’ll be late, but I imagine it leaves you (as a couple or just her) excluded from a lot of things too. 

In the future for camping, just go on a hike or swimming without her, you’re not joined at the hip and you don’t have to lose out on life experiences because of her lethargy.

Sounds like you just don’t want to marry her, which is fine but be honest with yourself."
489,"well, clearly your brother can no longer be trusted and you'll have to put your plans on hold for the time being, that doesn't mean you're stuck where you are. you can still escape.

its quite important that you keep up the pretense of your brother having misunderstood. you should text him and pretend that nothing is wrong. what you don't want is your parents seeing any change in behaviour on your part and interpreting it as you being deceitful. when you're out you can cut him off.

its time to start planning your next move. how far had your escape plans come along? what parts will you need to change, what parts can you keep."

498,"Ooh this one brings back memories.

Back when my oldest child was 7 months old, I was a stay at home mum breastfeeding day and night. My body had changed after pregnancy and even though I was the same size as beforehand I was a much different shape. Plus my boobs were now huge and needed to accommodate breastfeeding. I had no clothes that fit me, hadn’t had a hair cut in about a year, never went out and did anything for myself at all.

My ex still had regular hair cuts. He had a nice wardrobe. A gym membership. He was on sporting teams. 

Anyway I was given $400 from my grandmother for my bday. My ex made me feel like scum for wanting to spend it on me. “We have bills to pay, and you want to buy clothes?!”

His birthday is 5 weeks later. His uncle sends him $1000. He spent it all in a day without even telling me. I got home to find new clothing tags and receipts at the top of the rubbish in the bin. When I asked his response was “well we don’t have outstanding bills right now, and this is for my birthday. Are you actually mad at me for spending my own birthday money?!”

Well... stupid me ended up staying with him for another 7 years and having 2 more kids with him. Spoiler alert: he never changed. "
499,"If they’re in an open relationship, I wouldn’t be surprised if this “former” sexual partner is actually current."
500,"So he definitely has problems with sex, to the point where it's easier for him to fuck a blow-up doll (who has no needs, desires, or expectations) than be intimate with the woman he loves.

He *needs* therapy. He *needs* to work through this. Otherwise, you're never going to have a normal marriage."
501,"Well that was probably the hardest thing I have ever had to do but it’s done.

Thanks for all your support everyone, really do not think I would have been able to come to this conclusion without your help.

For those who want an update,

Came home to her packing her stuff, I sat down and made a tea for myself not knowing what to say, she said nothing but then proceeds to ask for me to forgive her and insists it was only flirting messages. I didn’t buy it. Asked her where she was going when she finished packing, she told me and I ordered her an Uber to get her out.

Now I am sitting her with another tea, powering up the flix. About to start picking up the pieces.

Again, thanks friends."
502,"He doesn’t get to buy a bacon cheeseburger when you’re living off less than $100 for food per month and can’t buy antifreeze. That’s so messed up of him, he’s living in a dream world where he can afford to do what he wants. If his big ego is the reason he won’t get on assistance, then he can get a second job to soothe it."
503,"OP, my ex did this (and installed key loggers) and it was part of why a judge awarded a 5 year long restraining order against him. The magnitude of how fucked up he is shouldn't be ignored. You shouldn't be with someone sick like this."
504,Why not get a sitter for the kids and ‘pick up’ your wife at a bar? Role play a little to see how that works for her. Have her go out for a drink (alcoholic or not) and you can dress a little differently/role play a different type of guy and get your flirt on. See if that gets her engine revving and if it does maybe you can experiment more with this in the future? Give her that ‘meet-cute” new relationship buzz but still with you.
505,"So your GF cheated. I think we should get that out there because you sort of buried the lead on that.

She has told you, unilaterally, that she will be sleeping with someone else. It is completely fair for you to break up for the single indiscretion, and this announcement that she'll 'hook up with him indefinitely' is a smashing blow in terms of her respect for you - there is none. 

Sadly this may have started out as a miscommunication but your GF took horrible advantage of the situation being up in the air. She NEVER should have made that move (regardless of what the universe was doing - what horse shit that line was) without having it nailed down with you what the ground rules are. 

Do not stand for a cheater. ESPECIALLY do not stand for one so unremorseful and disrespectful as this one. Kick her to the curb."
506,Hahaha no he hasn't paid for a damn thing. Will do this!!!
507,"I don't know if I agree with that wording. She's using a mild antibiotic for a large infection.

It may help, but it won't succeed without further treatment and a stronger dose, as time goes on."
508,"So many things!

1. How did you end up even dating him given his awful hygeine?! I once dumped a cute guy with a good job because he tried to have sex with dirt under his grossly long finger nails and when I asked him to clean that shit up for next time, he didn't bother. I did not let that man touch me.
2. It's very clear that you have some aspirational tendencies that he completely lacks - dining in nice places, looking nice and put together. Has he ever indicated he was interested in any of this? Or are you just trying to drag along someone who doesn't give a shit?
3. This dude is 29 and the way you describe him is embarrassing, he's unlikely to change. You are still young, get outta there!"
509,"&gt; To me, it reminds me of a group of lost boys looking for a mother figure.

Bingo. My friend group has a woman that was kinda like that, but we didn't let her walk over our girlfriends and SOs, so she learned to back off. She's a wonderful woman, overall, just protective of ""her boys"", and if we'd been a bit more weak-willed, it probably could have turned into a situation like OP's. So yeah, I think a lot of OP's situation is due to her bf's lack of a spine and lack of willingness to stand up to his sister-in-law. If I were OP, I'd tell the bf to either start standing up for his girlfriends, or be ready to spend his entire life single."
510,"It's a dealbreaker for me. About 50% of the posts on this forum are wives and girlfriends stressing over the fact that their male partners won't clean up after themselves and don't do any chores. This guy is closer to 30 than 20. If he isn't cleaning up after himself now, he's never going to do it."
511,"Your mom should not be putting you in the middle or putting words in your mouth. If you want to confront your dad, do it in your own words and on your own time. "
512,"I do think uninviting him on Sara's request without know more to form YOUR OWN position of where you stand with each of them was a misstep. It might be too late at this point to 'undo' it but I hope you'll at least reach out to Richard to offer apologies. As you don't know what went down, you shouldn't be shunning him from the group even if they have mutually decided to give each other space, and he probably now feels he's not welcomed to be with the other 13 people in this friend group, which must be sad for him. 

Of course, you could determine if you knew the details that you don't want to be friends with him either, but you aren't owed those details and without knowing he did something horrible, I don't think you should unfriend him. 

If they are going to agree to go their separate ways, it is up to THEM not everyone else, to execute that. You still get to be friends with both of them and thus will invite both of them. They can figure out for themselves which events they go to or don't, and if they are both in attendance they can give each other space and not talk to or about one another whilst there. "
513,"I think it’s almost definitely 2 rooms, as it sounds like one of them (the man cave) was converted into a guest room, and then the leftover stuff from the man cave went into the office, causing the office to now be a little crowded. 

Honestly I’m shocked OP thought he could move in with an SO and keep both of those rooms, as well as keep most of his apt in “darker colors”. I agree with a poster up above that it sounds like he had a drab bachelor pad and is sad it’s no longer that way. It’s weird to me that he didn’t see this coming. "
514,"I actually don't think he hates conflict, I think he enjoys working around people and manipulating them. A lot of this feels really calculated. Avoiding conflict tends to be more on-the-fly, back down to get out of trouble or not show up to things at the last minute. Typical avoiding behaviour. He's, I dunno, he's doing something *else.*
I don't think it's nothing. Maybe this time it turned out to just be about a dog, but what will it be next time? What about if it's you're not ready to have kids and he sabotages your birth control? Or you don't like a house he wants to move in to so he moves you into a hellhole to make the other one look better? He doesn't really care about your feelings or what you want, he's being selfish and calculating. Remember that if he talked to you about this stuff he'd have to consider your opinion and possibly compromise, so he takes the sneaky path to get what he wants regardless. Again that's not avoiding conflict. That's a power play."
515,"If your ex was close to your grandfather I understand why she'd want to be there. She knew him for eight years. If you're okay with it, I see no reason to bar her from the funeral like others are suggesting. 

However, bringing your new girlfriend? I'm sorry, but everything about this situation seems like a bad idea. You've only been together a few months. You dove right into a new relationship after EIGHT YEARS with someone else. She's 14 years younger. The vast majority of the time - however strong the feelings involved - this type of situation is temporary. People WILL frown upon it. Even if that wasn't the case, why would you risk huge blowups and awkwardness at a FUNERAL especially when you say you're handling his death fairly well and your family will be there for support? 

This is seriously not the time to surprise your ex with your new relationship or introduce your grieving family to your girlfriend. It's a bad, bad idea. "
516,"Kinda sounds like she might have cheated on him, and was paving the way to where she could blame it on someone else? Randomly picking this cousin as the attacker...

Wait, maybe she saw a guy, thought it was the cousin, tried to come on to him, got rejected, and decided the best defense was offense, and flipped the story to where he was coming on to her but of course she resisted... Only problem is she was too drunk to realize it wasn't even this cousin.

Or maybe a weirdly vivid dream she hasn't realized didn't actually happen?"
517,"Right? ""Propose or I'm breaking up with you.""

JFC, just let her break up with you, OP. And if she backslides on her ultimatum, break up with her. Your emotional self-care should come first and she clearly gives no fucks."
518,"And when they say that, point out that they made the choice to have children, and accepted all the responsibility that goes hand in hand with that choice.  Frankly, they sound nervy, irresponsible and lazy.  "
519,"This guy sounds kind of gross and manipulative, to be honest, and I think based on your previous conversation, he was trying to use you to make his girlfriend jealous in an attempt to accelerate her commitment to him.

Your instinct to dial back your friendship is a good one. You don't have to tell him why (or even that it's happening), but it would be fine to be frank with him if you feel like doing so would give you some peace of mind."
520,"If he's just a friend, she shouldn't care about you asking about him. The fact that you didn't accuse her of cheating but SHE mentioned it sounds like she's projecting... Also the fact that you're planning on getting married and she's refusing to talk to you? She sounds immature."
521,"Wow, thanks so much my man. This is actually amazing and it made me smile. You're very right in that in the end, I have her and he doesn't. I need to stop thinking as if I've already lost her. 

I've been trying my best to show my affection by bringing her on dates and cooking her dinner or just hanging out with her more in general but I agree that I need to amp it up. I'll probably plan something fun for this Labor Day weekend. 

This was such great advice, thanks again!"
522,"As soon as I read that sentence I wanted to comment this, but you're far more eloquent than I. This is such a crucial part of understanding interpersonal relationships in general that so many people so frequently overlook. "
523,Very important. It's a lot easier for companies to fire people while they are still in the probationary period. Don't put off complaining till it's too late. 
524,"It’s certainly possible that he’s attracted to Jennifer and he may have let that come out more than he intended while drunk. However, in his defence, marriage isn’t magic. You’re both going to find other people attractive at some point. What matters should be actions, not thoughts, and so far you don’t seem to think that he’s crossed any lines?

I’m not saying that you shouldn’t talk to him about this if it makes you uncomfortable. If it bothers you, you should let him know. That said, I don’t think you need to go nuclear and drag everyone else into it or ruin friendships, at least not yet. Your husband may be aware of his attraction and has decided that you and your family are more important and that he’s not going to act on it. I don’t think you can ask for more than that?

"
525,There are 50+ countries in Europe. He’s spending a short winter break traveling around. He won’t be able to see them all. You and he can still have the experience you want: traveling around Europe and seeing things for the first time. 
526,The likelyhood is that he's spent the money... I'd tell him that the first step to repairing the relationship is by paying you back your money minus what you think you owe him asap. 
527,"&gt;​

This comment is perfect. Why is it awkward to have a girlfriend? You are part of his life so why would he try to hide that?"
528,Screen shot his messages too. You'll want those in case you need proof. JIC  preemptively block him on any other media you might have.

530,"These behaviors you're describing are very much not normal - they are in fact very manipulative and inappropriate. I wish you luck in handling this situation, it's encouraging that you're starting to listen to your wife on this! "
531,"Your boyfriend is a manipulative asshole.

He may not be serious about breaking up, but he was serious about frightening and upsetting you and punishing you to try and get what he wants. 

Trust your instincts here. This man is full of shit. This will not be the last time he deliberately screws with your mind in order to get what he wants and keep you scarred and insecure.
"
532,Go to your moms and don’t come me home until/unless he steps up. My best friend’s husband did this. The had a come to Jesus meeting (about once a month) and couples counseling but she not leave and now her daughter is 2 and it’s the same story.
533,"Are you being too harsh? I think you’re being smart. I think you’re protecting yourself.

Ask yourself this: what could she possibly do to make this right? Is there any level of contrition she could display to get you to let her back in? It sounds like there isn’t, but you know better than we do.

It sounds to me like you’re done. That’s okay. It sucks but it’s okay. I don’t think you’re being too harsh. But the ball is in her court right now. I get that she was in a horrible situation and made bad decisions, but now that she’s not with this guy anymore she needs to take responsibility. It sounds like she’s not there yet."
534,"&gt;No, you shouldn’t tell your sister.

Please don't. I have an aunt who relays all the mean stuff my cousins say about me to me, and it has poisoned our relationship.

My cousins don't understand why I'm distant, I can't exactly confront them about things they said in privat to someone else (doesn't feel right to me), and I also no longer tell my aunt personal things either.

It's way better to tell the offending older sister directly to stop. This has nothing to do with being ""nice"". Talking shit about people behind their back isn't ""nice"". If older sister truly thinks the dress is horrendous, she should do younger sister the kindness to tell her to her face so she could have picked another

However, I don't think it's even about the dress. It's about younger sisters body. And she can't very much pick another of those.

Being told that one is ""too fat"" hardly ever leads to weightless (that's just a fact, it doesn't work that way), so some people feel it's safer to get the same message across by blaming the (fitting) clothes."
535,"He came over wanting a fight and made sure he got one. He screamed at you over nothing. This is his personality, and not only will it not change, it'll likely escalate. Leave before he really starts breaking you down.

'He's usually so sweet' 

No violent person/abuser is punching people 24 hours a day. Bad guys in real life are not bad guys in cartoons. "
536,"Image what he would say if he was writing this....”“my older brother hasn’t acknowledged my presence in over a year. Not even a hello. And we share a room.” 

You are his older brother.., and when he was around 15/16 years old you decided to stop initiating conversations with him, ...  ? As an experiment? Knowing he is an introvert?  I wonder how that made him feel. ?  You already know he isn’t a big talker and doesn’t really start conversations, so why do this?  Seems cruel IMO.  You effectively cut off any opportunity to have a relationship with him.... to perhaps help him be more comfortable with conversations. 

I am not sure why you are posting? Is it for advice?  If so- I would recommend that you start talking to him.  Stop playing games and get to know your brother. 
"
537,"Have you thought about ways to make yourself look a little bit older?  Makeup, hairstyle, accessories, and clothing can all do a lot here, but there is an art to it.  It might be good to play with some looks and see what you can find.

Similarly, have you really spent time figuring out how to dress to flatter your body/ use what you have (even those things you see as flaws)? There are so many things I find adult, and sexy, hot, beautiful, etc. that I can't wear as a larger chested woman. The right jewelry and cut of the neckline could do a lot for you here. If you google ""actresses with gap in teeth"" you might get some ideas for hair styles, makeup styles, etc.  Anna Paquin is the obvious one that comes to my mind, but I can think of others. If you're insecure about your thighs figure out what flatters them (or hit a gym and work on big thigh muscles, get that tshirt that says ""thick thighs save lives"" and own it). I can keep going with this, but I hope you get my point.  

I want to be clear here that I'm not telling you to change your appearance or to try to cover up what you see as flaws.  Instead the idea is to learn to love the things you are most insecure about.  More important than learning to dress for anything, it sounds like some work can be done on your self-esteem and on developing ways to like yourself and feel better about how you look.  There are lot of ways to do this from therapy and self-help techniques, to finding other sources of confidence. Work on that as well. A huge bonus is that maturity and self-confidence can help convey your age here. 

Then focus on other things about yourself that will be attractive to the kind of partner you want to attract.  Believe it or not, attractive people are everywhere.  Attractive, kind, people who share common interests and hobbies are harder to find.  Be smart.  Be informed.  Pick up some fun shared hobbies that you can do with potential dates.  Find ways to stand out and be fun to be around and find ways to show your interests early on. Have great adventures and interesting stories to tell. I have a trail running sticker and a sticker about a semi-obscure writer I love on my water bottle that I carry everywhere.  I can't tell you how many people have struck up a conversation over one of those stickers who recognize them as a shared interest. I probably could have dated through most of my 20s based on guys who recognized those stickers alone.  Most people who are worth dating, care about more than just looks and showing off and are going to be drawn to people who are participating in hobbies and events they enjoy.  Along with this, put yourself into other places where you will get to know people and where they will see you are obviously an adult. So an adult sports league, volunteering somewhere that is pretty clearly for adult volunteers, attending wine nights, trivia nights in bars, game nights, etc. Subtle behavior cues can also convey adulthood here.  Your drink and food order, the way you walk, whether you're always playing with your cell phone, carrying a book a highschooler would rarely be reading, etc. might be other ways of indicating you aren't a high schooler. 

All of that said, these guys that you find attractive are all still talking to you, right?  None of them rejected you yet or blew you off completely, yet.  And even if they do, that's part of dating (even the most attractive people get rejected occasionally). The fact that you've gotten this far means they either like your personality enough to keep talking (as a friend or more) or find you at least attractive enough to consider.  I wouldn't trust your brother's judgement here.  He sees you as his baby sister (hopefully) not a sexual object, so he isn't going to have the best advice. 

Plus, 8 years into a relationship when a flight home from visiting a dying relative has been delayed and you're sitting with your partner who has a sore back and work early the next day on a dirty airport floor I promise you they aren't going to be thinking ""I'm so glad my girlfriend looks like Megan Fox and I get to show off for all these other airport people."" Suddenly they are going to care a lot more if you can tell some interesting stories or make them laugh, know how to distract them or support them in their grief, are the kind of person who remembered to bring awesome airport snacks, and are going to be able to give them a great back massage once you both get home. Your physical appearance might be a bonus, but who you are matters way more. In other words, looks can help attract someone initially, but they can do little past making that initial connection. You can find ways to enhance your looks and find ways to attract people to you, but there are a lot of other things people care about when dating and your brother is a fool if he thinks looks are the only priority for most people.

All that said, the last piece is to consider what you look for in a partner.  Are looks what is most important to you (in which case you can expect to relate better to others who also see looks as most important which means your looks will matter a lot more to them)?  Or is something else (personality, future goals, athleticism, intelligence, etc.) equally desirable? When you say you are going for attractive men, are these people who are attractive to you (looks wise and otherwise) or are you simply prioritizing looks over everything else?  

I ask this not to say you are wrong to want to date someone who is attractive, but more to say that it is important to make sure you are looking at other traits alongside physical attraction. If I chose to believe your own assessment of yourself that you aren't incredibly attractive yourself, then it makes sense to look for someone who is attractive to you AND who also isn't solely looking for a certain type of physical attraction above all else. If you are online dating, make sure and read the profiles/ pay attention to what the guy appears to be looking for. "
538,"Yeah there was literally nothing about how he'll cut back on the gym and his own social life, just about what compromises OP would make."
539,"This is the reason people say not to marry someone if you have a huge difference in libido.  It is a very big incompatibility and almost always leads to you feeling rejected and frustrated, and him feeling pressured and like a failure.  If he sees a doctor that's great...but honestly, this is who he is and expecting or asking him to change something he has no control over is not fair.  It is like asking him to be hungry more often and eat when he isn't hungry."
540,"Please understand- that was no “accident” on her friend’s part. You need to discuss it with her, if only to make her aware that this person said such a thing to her new fiancé. 

The conversation needs to happen, or this information will eat you from the inside out. You need to see first hand how she reacts, what she has to say for herself. The allegation that she ruined multiple marriages is very serious. Let her tell you, in her own words, how and why she changed. "
541,Yep. Can confirm.  I am bipolar. My dad is bipolar. Two of my older brothers are bipolar. This guy is just a self-centered piece of shit. 
542,"&gt;So then my boyfriend will get all butthurt and upset with Linda **for not standing up for him.**

Remind him that he is the ADULT in the relationship, and she is the CHILD. It is completely unreasonable of him to expect his 14-year-old daughter to argue on his behalf. I don't know the people involved, but your boyfriend divorced his ex-wife - Linda doesn't have the same freedom.

&gt;I think this is somewhat emotionally abusive

Yeah, it is. My dad would always beg of me to ""defend"" him from my mother (ie, tell her not to yell at him). When they were yelling at each other, and he'd pointedly look at me, I'd say, ""Both of you, please stop fighting,"" and he'd get really butt-hurt that I wasn't directing my request at her specifically. I was seven at the time. I'm nearly 30 now, don't talk to my dad at all.

Ask your boyfriend what's more important: being right (ie, having his daughter around whenever he feels like it), or having a relationship with Linda. Because if he keeps acting butt-hurt every single time things don't go his way, he's going to find she wants nothing to do with him before long."
543,"If this was the first time, I'd say, give it a chance and explain to him exactly what a migraine entails. But you're saying there had already been breakup-worthy problems in the past, so honestly, I would let him go. This is just the last straw that broke the camel's back.

&gt; do you not understand how bad it hurts me when you say it under your breath so softly I can barely hear it?

Oh, the irony. Does he not understand how bad it hurts you when he yells at you while you have a migraine? The last time I had a migraine (my second ever), I threw up in the kitchen sink, closed all the curtains, and curled up on the couch with sunglasses on. I texted my husband that I wasn't feeling well. He took an early lunch break and came home with Gatorade for me. He sat quietly next to me as he ate his lunch and stroked my hair until he had to go. Find someone that thinks it matters when your head hurts."
544,"I'll say this, truly smart people? Don't need to say it. They don't need to constantly go around demeaning people to build up themselves. The fact that your boyfriend does it just means that he is insignificant and unintelligent and he knows it, and the only way he can build up his self confidence is to demean you. 

Basically, his words don't mean shit and the crap he is spewing out is fake. "
545,"Couples therapy to address the lie and how you are feeling. Also, make an appointment with a urologist and get a vasectomy if you don't want a second kid. "
546,"&gt; And what can I do to help my husband understand that I do really appreciate his efforts, but he can’t make the hurt of being kicked out of my family just go away?

He probably knows, he's just doing what he can. "
547,"I feel like I am reading about a past relationship here. I stayed way to long and when I finally left.. it gave me the freedom to live how I wanted. My ex was an awesome person, but we just really didn't wanna live the same life. We didn't take joy out of the same things"
548,"&gt; I know he’s better than this, which is why I’ve stuck around this long.

But he *isn't.* He doesn't think it's important to look after his hygiene. He doesn't think it's important to be attractive to you. He doesn't think it's important to find common ground with people. He likes to highlight difference and be separate and make people deal with his least enjoyable self even though he has a better self. He is not better than this. This is how he thinks. Is this really what you want?"
549,"While you may have face blindness and this maybe a reason you did not recognize her, she really should get over herself and find the humor in the situation.  I change my hair constantly but recently did a very drastic change (I did not think it was that drastic) but many people including my father did not recognize me, and one of my coworkers did introduce himself to me as he did not recognize as he thought I was a new employee.  We both laughed about it! It is a comedic situation not something that someone should hold against you. This is a her problem not a you problem, you can apologize again, but I don't see how she can be soo offended by this unless she has some vested interest in you finding her attactive?"
550,"I don't think your expectations are unreasonable but I do think they need to be communicated more explicitly.  For instance, I would judge Adam and Dave's behavior differently if you had said ""I'll fly you out there for Steve's birthday party,"" vs ""I'll fly you out so you can go to Steve's birthday and spend his birthday weekend with us.""

With your sister, she was talking explicitly about missing her gf and then you offered to pay for her. I could see how that would be interpreted as your gift being their time together. Making clear that you were posting for her gf to bond with all of you should have been made when you made the offer."
551,"Her fiancé is a raging douche. But if she marries him, there really is no avoiding him. If you choose to distance yourself from her, its not choosing your FWB over your friend. It’s choosing to not to put yourself in situations with violent people."
552,Christ. He was still jerking it to these nudes he took of women without their consent? Presumably they were also teens at the time these pics were taken? Fucking gross. 
553,"And the reunion wasn't even actually the first active mistake, it was the second! He'd already taken the liberty of calling dad for her and had the opportunity to listen to her objections/realize his mistake then. Doubling down, indeed!"
554,"Yeah this seems way more like he's trying to make a jerk regret their insults. 

I'm not sure why OP thinks he'd be attracted to someone who hurt his feelings. "
555,"&gt;If you were running like crazy people prob did not tip because of slow service.

He also stated being really angry and whether he intended it or not, he may have projected an attitude. Combine that with slow service, people would be less likely to leave a tip that wasn't bare minimum."
556,You might just be ill suited for each other due to different priorities and different sex drives. It happens...
557,"How close is the wedding? Did you already purchase your dress? Did you book time off from work? Did you buy plane tickets, hotel, rental car?  I think you'll get different responses if the wedding is this weekend, versus several months away."
558,"To the girl who responded that she had to work as well but went out anyway - so? It’s just not for you. You should reply back with, “Ok, but I hate doing that because I feel terrible the next day. I’ll be glad to come out the next time I don’t have work the next day!” and just stick to your guns. Don’t feel guilty. I am an early to bed person and always have been, and I never feel guilty about it."
559,"She literally doesn't want you  acknowledging more than half the world's population. What happens when you get a job where you have to interact with women? Is she going to force you to quit?

&amp;#x200B;

This girl is nuts. You guys should probably break up and find people that will allow you to have platonic friendships outside your relationships."
560,"Packing all his stuff up and 'proposing you take a break' is not how it's done. He wants everything his way. Let him learn a lesson by saying no and moving on.

Also I agree with others who call bullshit on his apparently having realised he'd made a mistake as soon as he got off the plane. If that had been the case, he would have been getting on the next flight back and crawling to you for forgiveness.

You deserve better than him OP. He wanted a chance to stop having to consider your feelings, so now's your chance to step up and put those same feelings first.

566,"Look OP. If your best friend came to you and told you she was ""disgusted"" with her boyfriend, a boyfriend who shoved his fingers inside her without the slightest foreplay/consent and who routinely expects her to be a literal flashlight for him with NO reciprocation, what would you tell her? 

Hopefully you would tell her to have some self respect and dump his ass because not only can she find SOMEONE better, I would say approx 90% of the male population is better than him. So just statistically speaking the next guy will be better. Fuck that noise. A vibrator could do better than him in bed."
567,"You have done nothing wrong. Pregnancy is much riskier than many people realize, even for perfectly healthy women. Women often don't talk about miscarriages, and that is why people don't realize how common they are. It wasn't your fault and you don't deserve to be called names for it! "
568,"You and your parents need to get into family counseling asap.  Your parents are fighting and aren't thinking about you, tell them you want a safe place to talk about what is happening."
569,"This update makes me sad.  He’s still controlling and won’t address his insecurities.  OP, you have more agency here than you think you do.  You guys really need to see a counselor to work this out before the resentment builds and it’s too far gone.

Good luck, I really hope you don’t lose yourself to this relationship."
570,That’s what my husband and I have been considering. The only issue is that my kids have school now and my husband has the only vehicle so getting them to school might be an issue. And not to mention our Axolotl that is in a 20 gallon tank and requires cold water. I have thought of trying to rehome him because I’m worried that he will die if she decides to turn off the electricity on us (she’s threatened to turn the breaker off to the room we’re in).
571,"&gt; The fact he didn’t fight it actually shows that maybe he wasn’t so immature, you guys just had different needs from a relationship, which is fair.

What he said he wanted is also very reasonable; more of her time and energy and that they communicate more. Based on OPs initial description, he either went a bit overboard with this, or just wants a very attached relationship, but in context it sounds like he just wants to be with someone who has a different work and private life balance."
572,"She will pretend she has no idea what you are talking about. ANd if you show her the actual evidence and point to the physical page, she will STILL pretend she has no idea what you're talking about. She will absolutely double-down and try to convince you that you wrote it and now you sound TRULY crazy by trying to insist she wrote it. 

You can't win this one. The only way to win with a narc is to not play the game. Don't engage. Limit your contact. No more visits. Don't initiate contact with her and only respond to her texts/emails/phone calls when she behaves appropriately. 

I took that route with my own narc mother. I wouldn't ""feed"" her narc supply by engaging with her when she said crazy shit. I would only respond when she talked to me like a rational, adult human. She got so fed up with that that she accused me of ""divorcing"" her, sent me a truly crazy message about how much I hate her, and stopped speaking to me. 

Life is much better now. "
573,"I tried last night to sleep in the bedroom. He complained that it was the worst sleep he ever had, and said he “just couldn’t” wake up in the night. He said he doesn’t have maternal instincts and that he would just roll over and let the baby cry. I’m not going to let my baby starve to death so here we are. 

I’ve told him pretty much everything. 

He keeps inviting people over for dinner on top of it. And I had a meltdown over it last night when he told me we were having some of his friends over Tuesday night and Thursday night. These dinner parties he doesn’t plan for, or help cook for or prep for. He doesn’t clean the house for them, he just invites people over and has me do all the work. 

I told him last night that i felt like the marriage wasn’t even worth it since I bring in my own income and he creates more work and problems for me. "
574,"&gt;Should I see this as a red flag?

Yes.   He knew for a week that you were coming over and this is the time in the relationship when he will be on his very best behavior.   If you stay with this guy you will be responsible for every bit of cleaning that happens in your home.   If you are OK with that then carry on but a gross bathroom, kitty litter, major dust / funk, the huge pile of dirty dishes - those would all be deal breakers for me.  "
575,"From my point of view, this is clearly a date. Now, I'm neither from Italy nor a small European country (just a regular-sized European country), but to me there is no doubt.

Hence, letting the woman know subtly beforehand is the nice thing to do. This way, she'll be prepared and can safe face if that's not what she wanted. If she did in fact not see it as a date, it changes nothing, but if she did, she was ""warned"" and adjust without showing the actual disappointment in the moment.

Dunno, if I took the courage to ask a guy out, and then, on the date, had to hear that he as a girlfriend, I'd be super unhappy.

If he's worried about your thigh being bigger than his, maybe he needs to go to the gym and invest in a few leg days. This would borderline be a deal breaker for me just because he knows your history and a stupid comment like that could do serious damage to your mental health. If you want to stay with him, make it clear to him that he's out of line and he's not allowed to comment on your weight ever again. Period. "

582,"She is upset she lost easy access to information about you she can spread. She is not really feeling less close imho, she just doesn't get her weekly dose of drama from you anymore.

Stop justifying yourself to her. You tell her once 'I stopped social media, that won't change. I already told you it had nothing to do with you, cut it out.'

Then you stop JADEing, and start setting boundaries. Everytime she brings it up, leave the conversation (as in hang the phone up, mute her texts or physically leave the location) and tell her the reason in no uncertain terms (""we've had this conversation before, this is not up for discussion, so I am leaving now. Have a great day, bye bye"").  Be friendly but firm about it. Rinse and repeat.

Best of luck with it, after a few weeks she will probably let it go. :)

On the other hand, he has taken your money under false pretenses and now refuses to give it back. Depending on where you live that's at least fraud and possibly grand theft (standard IANL disclaimer). 

I was originally willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but now he seems like a manipulative lying asshole who stole your money. You may want to contact his parents about this, since they may have access to the account. Make it clear that if your money is not returned immediately, you will seek legal recourse and possibly criminal charges against all of them (his parents conspired with him to defraud). Keep all correspondences about this for future legal action. As much as possible get things in writing (text, email) rather than having voice conversations on the phone or in person.

Looking back I have NO fucking idea what the hell was wrong with me!!!???  I stayed another few months after I made that list.  I wasted a total of 4 years pining for that piece of shit.

But there's an element here where she either knows this is making you jealous or is really oblivious, which I doubt, and neither thing is something I'd really want to put up with. You do need to work on being more secure because it's not an easy way to walk through life. I don't have the best feeling about this situation with your gf, though.

As for those effed up ""dinner parties"" that he has the nerve to try to shove down your throat, you sit him down and tell him that you are going to do nothing. You are not going to clean and you are not going to cook, not even at gunpoint, and when those people who have no business expecting a woman who just gave birth to feed them enter your home, you are going to excuse yourself because you have a three week old *newborn* to take care of, and you won't engage with them *once* after that. "
593,"""No"" is a complete sentence, OP.  You and your wife are not babysitters, nor do you owe them anything for being related to them.  Don't let them get any childcare out of you, for any reason, because they clearly think of you only as for that purpose, and families should respect one another, not use one another.  "
594,"Honestly, you do kind of sound a little control freaky. Unless your family has a serious history of crossing boundaries, giving people a list of what you do and don't want and what they can and can't do is a little strange, IMO. If someone offers something you don't want, say ""no thank you"" and get on with it. But it kind of sounds like you're assuming that anyone other than your closest family and friends *are* going to give you and your pregnancy more than 5 minutes of thought. You've created the drama you say you wanted to avoid. Chill out and they will come around.

Have a safe pregnancy and healthy baby."

On days he doesn’t go in until late, he stays up and sleeps on the couch.

Also, as another poster noted, some people have a hard time sharing beds. There are lots of legit reasons why. Regardless, he needs to stop promising something he has no intention of doing and you two need to have an open, honest, respectful discussion to resolve this."

She is super petty. Basically you should ignore this woman, hardcore. 

Make polite conversation. But here's how you can shake things up: **You and your SO need to share planning/hosting events where all SOs are invited.** If she won't include GFs, well then you have to start having events where she isn't in the position to restrict the guest list! Heck, also try to get to know the dates/any GFs of your boyfriend's friend group. If you all start mixing socially with more regularity, then the guys will start insisting SOs are *also included* during events C only invites the guys to!

&gt;I feel left out, sad, and like there’s someone out there waiting and hoping my relationship fails.

You can't control what someone thinks of you. You can only continue living your best life! Make the decision to actively enjoy your day and smile with your man. He likes to see you happy, not upset. Appreciate and have fun with one another."

He would say ""anorexic girls aren't sexy"" and ""being skin and bones makes you look like a child"" I had small curves and decent boobies, but he constantly would tell me I was too thin and it was gross.  Well I ended up gaining like 50 lbs while I was with him and I hated how I looked and felt.  And even though I gained weight like he wanted he just found something new about me that I needed to change,  my clothing style,  my hair color/ cut,  my friends, and so on.  I was never ""good enough""for him.  We broke up and I was devastated by how I looked.  I felt hideous.  I ended up losing most of the weight (I'm back down to 117 now) but I have serious body issues now.  I'm constantly trying to diet and lose more weight.  I never look skinny enough.  He basically ruined how I saw myself.  I see a psychiatrist now and she says I have bdd. Please if you like the way you look and you feel healthy don't change for anyone.  Tell him to shut the fuck up and find a Instagram model if that's what he wants so bad . I doubt he will ever get anyone better than you.  That's why he wants to change you. Stay true to yourself.  No guy is worth changing something that is perfect to begin with.  And seriously if he doesn't knock it off when you tell him to stop.  Find someone who will love you exactly how you are. "
598,Well honestly take it from me... That's a highly demanded video he has now. Which is honestly in my opinion the only reason he would have a camera in the top 3 places you are naked.
599,"Consent isn't the absence of no. Yes is yes. No yes is no. 


I would have dumped this guy on the spot. It was disgusting to read. He literally lubed her up like a fleshlight. If he needs to get off he can do that by himself, and yet he decided to use OP. Ew ew ew ew ew"
600,"You’re making excuses for him. No one can make you say things. She isn’t feeding him lines. He has fundamentally changed from the person you knew.
"
601,I have an old mini fridge from college I dragged out of storage and now have everything locked in my room!
602,"pretend to forgive him. I'm serious. Act like you want to take  a vacation with him to get over everything and de-stress. Play nice and get him to say he'll give you your money back via text. 

Hopefully kissing up will be enough to get him to give you access. At which point you take it all and run. Fuck paying him back for anything.

I don't know what kind of people his parents are but maybe you can get them involved? If they suck, then don't bother but hopefully they can shame him into not being a fucking thief.


"
603,"That was the part that really bothered me. She told him she didn't want to have sex, she was so upset she left the room to get some space, and his response was basically to follow her and say he ""needs"" it.

It just sounds like he feels entitled to her body as basically a fuck-toy. Gives me those gross, creepy shivers just thinking about how skeevy this guy is.."
604,"Thanks I still feel pretty strongly it's not my problem to sort out but if they end up getting married, Kate will forever remember that time I wasn't welcoming when I had the space. It's still pretty infuriating though. "
605,"Also, she’s technically ‘one of the girlfriends’!  She’s not the boyfriends bio sister, she’s married to the brother!  I could understand that attitude *slightly* more if it was a bio sister and it was just a sibling only outing every once in a while.  But seriously, fuck her and fuck her meddling. Boyfriend needs to totally stand up to this woman."
606,"As an update for you guys.

She is moving out as of tonight at my request.

Has asked me when I will be back to the house so she can say good bye before she leaves.

Is still denying that there is any other guy.

Has told me I have no right to think there is another guy."
607,Pretty sure she's not at her sister's place dude...
608,"That's a big ask for young marrieds.  Start with a family counselor and a consult with a specialist in family law.

You might want to go in steps - get guardianship first to see how things work out with your brother-in-law.   Yes, you are opening yourselves, and the child to possible destabilization later but it could be better in the long-run.  For one thing, you would be collecting support from BIL as you get established."
609,"I must say, your comment was a blessing in disguise - even though you were off your rocker on coffee, you were on the ball and really hit the nail on the head with your comment. It seems we see eye to eye."
610," \&gt; He picked up my backpack that was near him and chucked it across the room. He then kicked clothing article and had his fists clenched.

Led to

\&gt; I felt scared he might hit me or destroy something in our room.

That was the desired outcome. That's exactly what he wanted.

\&gt; I have thrown things when mad before, but never in an argument, mostly when I was alone and frustrated.

That's different. Notice how he throws your belongings, in anger, in front of you vs. you taking your own items, when you're alone. One of those is letting out frustration when alone, the other is a thread. Now it's not quite clear to me if he even could have thrown his own items, as he was at your place, but it's typical for DV situations for the abuser to throw/destroy their victims belongings, not their own (don't want to break those, after all).

\&gt;  We will discuss it in therapy this week for sure. 

You must not go to couple therapy with abusive partners. They will learn your weak points and use those to attack you further.

The therapist is not supposed to take sides, but that only works if both people are somewhat equally to blame. With abuse, the abuse is 100% on the abuser, and shifting any of that to the victim makes everything worse. Don't go to therapy with him. I advice you to break up and block all contact."
611,"You are in a relationship with a condescending verbal abuser. He knows how you feel, he just doesn’t care, because you’ve trained him that there are zero real-life consequences for stomping all over your very reasonable boundaries. You know what to do, you’re just unwilling to do it because you think that you can make him see the error of his ways because he loves you so much.

Keep on kissing that frog if you like. He will never, ever become a prince. "
612,"The way you talk about your partner reminds me so much of my last relationship. He was sweet and caring and the best man I knew. He was my favorite person in the world. I trusted him with my life. If anyone suggested he might cheat or be keeping things from me, I would laugh at them and say, “yeah right.”
But we had similar issues. He would fall asleep on the couch, wouldn’t pick up after himself, and would rarely have sex. He didn’t go down on me for the last two years of our relationship. The whole time he would make the same empty promises and consoling gestures as your boyfriend. I put up with it because, well, I loved him. He was my best friend. And we lived together. And he was my favorite person. Etc etc etc. 
And then one day he straight up told me he wasn’t sexually attracted to me anymore. I never thought someone I loved could hurt me so much. A few months later he ended things very suddenly. 
Your favorite person can do awful things to you"
613,"You can’t. He will beat you one day if you stay. He deliberately terrified you because he wanted to punish you for not interrupting your studying to make him a snack. You are absolutely in danger if you don’t leave him. Abuse escalates. Call your mom and ask her how it all started with the ex husband. There’s always a first time they threaten, a first time they hit you. Get out. "
614,"If she isn't ready emotionally there isn't much you can do about that, so as you say the next best thing is to make sure your financial and other affairs are in order to save her having to deal with too much practical stuff.

Write the living will, in other words make it plain what you want to happen when you get to the end of your life in terms of care etc and say explicitly if you don't want to be kept artificially alive. Your wife should have a copy, and give another to your lawyer and your physician and your parents or other family.

Obviously make sure your normal will is up to date as well. Get some legal advice generally about your worries over medical debt.

Try to involve your wife in these arrangements and maybe she will start to talk about things more. Good luck my friend."
615,"I agree with this solution as well! But he (used to, I think these comments are changing his mind) think that would be too awkward. "
616,"I think I remember that one (or one similar), she spoke about how she ""won"" because she forced him into letting her take the kids to see his abusive family during a holiday and when she came back he had moved out of the house. She was actually proud about how she had tore her husband down to the point he didn't even fought her on the issue anymore. I felt so bad for the poor guy. "
617,"A lot of women miscarry. It's really quite common, although no one talks about it. If the thought of addressing it makes you so anxious, I would say wait to talk about it until you really trust your partner and can envision potentially having a future with them. I don't think they would see you as a stupid teenager, especially considering you meant to try your hardest to be a good mother in the future. Your miscarriage isn't your fault - it was a tragic event, but also a normal one that you couldn't have controlled. If your future partner is worth the effort, he has to understand that"
618,Document everything.  Go to HR immediately before he does anything crazier.  
619,"She saddled that kid with a job from conception, and that job was to make her feel better about her life. What happens when your child starts to grow up and needs distance from Mom? Is your wife going to spiral back down because her son doesn't ""need"" her anymore? Is she going to take it personally when he wants to spend time with friends? Is she going to resent him when he starts dating because he's ""replacing"" her? What plans does she have for her life after momhood?

What is she doing to manage her depression?"
620,"Nope, your boyfriend has to be the one that deals with this. Sure, getting into conflict with your family is uncomfortable but his SIL is *purposely* creating conflict. She's doing this to undermine the relationship and its his job to end that nonsense. "
621,***TIFU by introducing my boyfriend to my boy friend***
622,"Part of me hopes we find a reddit post from somebody asking for a person to teach him to be good at chess. 

""I really like this guy and I kind of panicked and told him I was a chess champion. I don't know why I said it, I guess I thought it would impress him but now he wants to play with me. I barely know the rules, can anybody help me learn to play better or recommend some videos??"" "
623,"How does this guy even manage to juggle a marriage, kids, job, a legit side piece, AND paying for prostitutes all at the same time? I get tired if I have plans on Friday AND Saturday in one weekend.  "
624,"Damn, you sure put up with a lot from her. If my girlfriend had done any of this, she wouldn't be my girlfriend. You're putting too much effort into something thats dead. You need to stand up for yourself and be done. "
625,"Sounds much more like you're being gaslighted by an abusive husband than you're being forgetful, to be honest. "
626,"Eh, I expect she's not the first angry ex they will have talked to. If all your exes will talk shit about you, you may have a problem but if she's the exception it's probably not going to matter that much."
627,Maybe if she’s been very homesick she’s hoping family and friends will come and visit and use the new spare room?
628,"Yeah, I want to sympathise with you, but honestly it's not rocket science. If you're not sure then ask or watch a YouTube video or read a wikihow article.

Cleaning is a skill, but once you've done it right once, then you pretty much know how to do it forever."
629,I use to work in a domestic abuse shelter too. Same rules. Had to ban Facebook inside because women were sharing details including who was hiding there and it's a small town so....yeah. gotta protect our ladies. 
630,Yeah that's called sexual assault. 
631,"Yes. If you live in the zoo you stop smelling the shit. You have normalized things beyond outrageous. But, don't beat yourself up. Have you ever heard the metaphor about the boiling frog? I don't know when in your life the fire got turned on but you've been on a slow boil for a long time and now this shit is fucking cooked.

I don't know if you have decent people in your life, solid, smart, loving and compassionate. Not everybody does. I didn't. But I swear to God, if you have one decent person in your life, they will rejoice when you leave this asshole. A prison pen pal treat you with more respect. A prison pen pal would let you talk about family, and problem solving. Hell, a prison pen pal husband will probably hustle behind Bars to send you some money.

I'm not trying to make light or be funny. I hope you get angry, angry enough to see the truth, angry enough to know your worth, and to know the only way to fight for it is to leave. "
632,"Call the police and your landlord. He can’t put cameras in the bathrooms or your room, and you have a legal right to make sure the videos he has are deleted. Have you had any friends use the bathroom? Cause they are in the videos too. "
633,"The creator of the spoon theory literally said it can apply to mental illness. Your friend is being silly. Look up “You don’t look sick” by Christine Miserandino if she/any one else needs proof of this.

To answer the question you asked, tell her, “I am going to continue to use the spoon theory to describe my mental illness. It is a perfectly valid thing to do. I feel hurt that you don’t think my illness is “enough” to be considered chronic, as I struggle with it every day.”

Does your friend do the “oppression Olympics” thing often? If so, you may want to think about not sharing mental health information with this person."
634,"This is a long way out from the present time, and I'm wondering if the disagreement is about any support at all for the sister, or this specific kind of support? I mean, at 18 she might not be ready for college, she might want to live on campus, and she might need to live with you guys - but there's no way to know that now. 

The hours he works, the fact that you do all the cooking and cleaning AND am the breadwinner - those seem like the hidden problem in this discussion. The sister is just the symptom. It almost sounds like marrying this guy will be burden #1; burden #2 is the sister. Just something to think about.

And an aside: I don't know what you mean by the mom taking the student loan refund. Do you mean that the kid would take out a loan and instead of using it to pay for school, the mother would just take it any use it? Perhaps this depends on where you live, but most student loans in the US are disbursed directly to the school, so there's no real way for the mom to get her hands on it.  Also, when she's 18, she will be in charge of all school communications anyway. So this is really confusing to me.

"
635,"Next time he invites people don’t cook for them. See what happens then because it’s not your problem at all if they go hungry.

And I’m surprised they are willing to come over 3 weeks after the baby and have YOU be the cook. Who are these people? "
636,Not usually but I have in the shower which also had a camera...
637,"I think you should go to the family therapy - not for your benefits, but for theirs. They're definitely overwhelmed by the guilt, feel like they have betrayed you, and have probably played out the scenario way too many times in their head. Since they obviously won't take your word for it, it's time for therapy to unpack their baggage. 

Try to be supportive of your family at this difficult time. It'll be okay. "
638,Yeah i was thinking he broke it off with a girlfriend (or more likely she broke it off with him) and now needs that safety net back in place
639,[deleted]
640,"&gt; I said I could go down for the funeral and be back all within 24 hours, and it was a no go, so I decided to support her, and stay with her.

Yooooooo....

Nobody alive could make me miss my grandma’s funeral. That would’ve been my hill to die on.
"
641,"&gt; These are not his first time facing charges of this nature. He may be facing 25 years in prison. 

&amp;#x200B;

What has happened in your life that you think this is the best you can do?

He's not going to jail for some accident and tragic slip of justice. This is a pattern. You need to get out. "
642,"Yeah, deep conversations and good sex or whatever are nice to have, but realistically like 80% of life with a partner is mundane things like driving to do errands, working so you can pay bills, and *not burning the house down*.

Reliability is a vastly undervalued trait in romantic partners.

Life is hard enough, don't date people who are likely to introduce the following dramatic scenarios into your life:

* House burns down, insurance won't pay out because it was BF's fault. Also now the cat is dead. From fire.
* Attending court hearing because your BF killed someone while driving and he might be sentanced to jail time
* Getting a call from a hospital emergency room because BF seriously injured *himself* driving
* Debt collectors call your house at all hours of the evening threatening legal action because your BF-now-husband 'got stressed'. On the bright side, you know a lot about the legalities of debt collection and how to deal with aggressive people now."
643,"It sounds perfectly normal to have your best man come along, provided he can keep it to himself and not spoil the surprise."
644,"Right, that's why breaking up was the right thing for both of them. No-one's quite to blame, both can't make it work. "
645,I don't get his point at all
646,"I think a lot of the advice in here is off the mark. It's assuming you're right and she's wrong (to some degree), and that everyone needs to enjoy sex all the time.

If she's content then believe her. Not everyone is obliged to enjoy sex their entire lives; hormones change, relationship dynamics shift, things happen. She's not repulsed by it and not refusing to engage in it, she's actually happy to provide you with relief, so there's no toxicity that would lead to a DBR scenario. She just sounds like she's figured out her libido and sexuality and that's all there is to it. Pushing the issue with ploys to try and reinvent NRE is insulting I think, you can't revive NRE and you shouldn't try.

It's normal to feel upset about it but it should be enough for you that she's happy with the current dynamic and totally fine with engaging in sexual acts for your sake. If it's a deal breaker for you that she's not also high libido or 'enthusiastically consenting' (whatever people think that means), then you'll need to consider if leaving is appropriate."
647,"I was feeling the same couple weeks ago. My DH and I no longer kiss each other passionately, except when we're having sex (bedroom stuff is still amazing anyways). We've been together for 3.5 years (married for almost 5 months).

I brought it up and I can assure you that it was really awkward. So we made a deal that we have to kiss each other passionately for one minute each night. Started off feeling weird (we even set a timer for this) but after a week or so, we now can kiss again like we used to. We no longer use timer or discuss when to start, it came out naturally.

All the best for you and your fiancé!"
648,"My dad was sick for years, he tried very hard to prepare my mom. She wasn't ready. She was a mess. She was denying it was happening almost to the very end. And I can't blame her — this was the person she'd spent nearly all of her life with. I don't think you can really be prepared for that. It's been six months, and it still doesn't seem real to her (or me, if I'm being honest). He made sure she was going to be OK financially and we're helping her as much as we can. She's doing OK, as much as I think can be expected. 

My husband has broached the topic of his death before and my knee-jerk reaction was: ""I don't want to talk about this."" It's a very human reaction, I think."
649,Ask him why he is hiding his phone and always looking at messages
650,"He wanted something to get mad about. He baited you into saying that you were concerned, didn't accept your praise for bringing the issue to him, and kept pushing until he found something to explode about.

There isn't really a way to handle someone who doesn't want to be handled."
651,Homegirl has a single memory box. That's super minimalist 
652,"Your husband is essentially seeking validation outside of your marriage. I mean, you don't have to go nuclear, but this is a definite red flag. 

I think you should be honest to him that you read his messages. Just tell him, ""Hey, I saw you talking to this girl and that you were saying you wanted to travel Europe with her. What is that about?"" "
653,"Financial/economic abuse exists in nearly all abusive domestic relationships. Even if there is no physical violence (yet) if you are entirely cut off from financial reasources and decision making in the family, then you are being controlled and you are at risk of escalating abuse.

One of the key tactics of these kind of abusers is keeping female partners pregnant and unemployed. It provides an excuse for the abuse, but it doesn’t mean abuse isn’t happening. "
654,[deleted]
655,"Dude, this girl is awful for you. She was using you day in day out, you had to work and support her, you told her you were stressed out and the job was too much so you asked her to get a job, and she didn't.

Yea, I bet she had a falling out with Anna, she realized she would have to support herself and would have to get a job, and misses the easy life she had with you. No, she was a shitty person to you, she realizes how good she had it and wants back in. Don't take her back! Move on, you're better off without her"
656,"What you went through is absolutely terrible and I won't make light of it. However, I do notice something about your behavior I have seen before, that never went well for those involved... That being externalizing your self-esteem and self-regard to outside factors.

&gt;  I’m beginning to feel more and more worthless by the day because I don’t have anyone in my life who can love me in that way.

Like this. There's nothing inherent about loneliness that speaks to greater issues, nor is there anything wrong with wanting to be with someone. Those are completely natural impulses. 

But like many things, they can be taken too far. A relationship is supposed to be about enhancing your life, not completing it or filling a void of meaning, because such attempts are ultimately misguided. Others can't give you purpose in that way.

Is therapy an option for you?"
657,"Yes, definitely! Then don't let that stay a rhetorical question. Get him to spell out to you how he'd feel in your shoes, whether it would hurt him so hopefully he'd see how messed up it is he expects you to sit there and take it. For years. Ridiculous."
658,"No contact in these situations is hard, but always for the best. Of all the breakups I've gone through where I've tried to remain friends with my exes, it was always followed by months of turmoil and uncertainty. But the ones I went no contact with resulted in such a quicker healing process because I was able to pour all my focus into the parts of my life that helped get me back on track."
659,"I remember a post in here recently in which someone was talking about being caught red handed in a lie by his SO and he said that he just doubled down on the lies and even got angry with his SO for suggesting he was lying.

People definitely do this."
660,It kind of sounds like he never stopped dating her. Does she even know you're his girlfriend? 
661,"You aren't going to take this seriously but I have a few minutes on my hands.

He more than likely does not have a mental problem.  What he seems to have is an entitlement problem.  That is abuser territory.  Abusers don't abuse because they're crazy, they abuse because they think they're entitled to treat their victim that way.  That they *deserve* it.

1. This will only get worse.
2. You have to leave.
3. I don't care how you feel about this guy, he's Bad News.
4. This will only get worse.

Do not take him to therapy with you.  Abusers only learn how better to abuse and hide it in those situations.  Make a plan to leave, keep it hidden, then leave when he's gone.

If you happen to have some free time, look for your BF in this book: ""Why Does He DO That?!"" by Lundy Bancroft.  It's about how to recognize abusers.  Also look at loveisrespect(dot)org.  Take the test there about whether this is abuse."
662,"Holy insecurity, Batman. 

This woman has admitted that she resents you for dating women before her, and now she’s trying to leverage her *own* history to make you feel as miserable and jealous as she feels. I’m guessing she knows on some level that her attitude is toxic but if she can make you react the way she does to *your* dating history, she’ll feel vindicated and won’t have to check herself anymore. She is baiting you into sharing her insecurities so she feels less crazy. 

I think you need to have a serious talk with her about this. If she can’t let go of this notion that you somehow betrayed her by dating other people, this relationship is not going anywhere good. If she needs to put herself into therapy to unpack and address her insecurities, so be it, but she *cannot* keep making them your problem. No amount of reassurance from you is gonna fill up that black hole."
663,"Exactly. He had an image in his head of father and daughter falling into one another's arms and weeping with joy while he looked on and smiled indulgently, followed by people thanking him profusely for ""healing"" the family split and patting on the back and telling him what a good person he was. His girlfriend and all her feelings and boundaries and wishes were reduced to being nothing more than a prop in his little ""Look what a good, saintly person I am"" drama."
664,"Look, I feel for you on the career bit. I do. But your husband has helped you pay down nearly triple digit debt. It sounds like there’s actually a finish line in sight. And then you go and apply for a program that will put you another $70 grand in the hole without, from what I can tell, a set career path. You say you KNOW it will get you a better paying job but have you spoken to recent grads? Have you researched the industry? Will you earn enough to quickly pay down all the debt? Are there jobs available in your area?

I get why he’s upset. You’re in your 30s. I don’t know what your other financial goals are but going into more debt won’t help a single one of them. Not to mention it doesn’t sound like you really talked this out with him first. You just applied. And going back to school will also impact your life: less social time, less time for chores, less time for vacations, less time for your spouse. 

I’d be mad too, if I were him. I don’t think ignoring you is the right tactic. But I’d be good and mad. You’re married and your life is *with* your spouse. Grad school isn’t something you can just go do anymore. It affects his life as much as yours.

I think grad school should go off the table for now. Explore other career paths by all means but not ones that include an expensive degree. Seek out other work. Try to find a better paying job. Get a side job. Get rid of the debt. And then talk to your husband about saving for grad school and research all that it entails. Talk with him and make a plan before diving into something so life altering. 

"
665,"Before you serv him eviction notice, take photographs of everything in the apartment and put everything you value into storage. Everything."
666,"&gt;I was throwing away 20 years over a simple mistake and that she needs me, I'm her only friend

It's always been about her. The whole time she used you as a crutch. I'm guessing you didn't get much out of the friendship?

You did the right thing, good for you for not caving.

​Has she even apologized for endangering you?"
667,"I think you did the right thing...if this friendship can ever be repaired it isn't going to be any time soon. You need time to forgive her for what she did, and she needs time to deprogram her brain from all of the abuse. She may need you right now but the truth is if she doesn't experience consequences the weight of what she did and what he is might never sink in. "
668,"It sounds like you might be okay, but don't get caught up in trying to be the ""cool girl"". 

It's not unreasonable to ask your boyfriend to not indulge someone, even civilly, who is openly encroaching on your relationship boundaries. Whether he's gonna stray or not, it's perfectly normal for you to be worried in this kind of scenario, and if he's being nice to her so as to not kick up a fuss, he's prioritising her feelings over yours.

I think it's worth talking to him about it, telling him it makes you anxious, and seeing how he responds."
669,[deleted]
670,"I’m generally not one to come on here and recommend dumping the SO. But this would be a deal breaker for me. It’s not about the dad even. He completely went against her wishes on something that is purely her life choice. He lied to her to put her in this position. He’s mad at HER that it didn’t work out the way he wanted it to. This is the kind of person who cancels plans for you, makes major financial purchases and decisions without you, calls your boss to schedule vacation time, and sabotages your birth control because he wants kids even if you’re not ready. I would be out so fast his head would spin. "
671,"\&gt;  She doesnt work and i do make our living 

So what's she bringing to this relationship?"
672,"I was going to say the same thing. Your family is being **intentionally rude**. I could understand if this was a once a year thing and they weren't really fluent in English. But you are visiting weekly and they are, they should be making a bigger effort to include your wife. 

&gt; I tried introducing topics that they have in common and I translate for Emma all the time but nothing seems to be working out well. 

The issue here is that instead of translating and trying to force conversation when YOUR family had no desire to make an attempt to socialize with the woman you CHOSE to marry, you should have called them out on their rude behavior and refused to visit until they changed their attitude. Your wife is in a foreign country for you, surrounded by a language she doesn't understand and you have allowed your family to treat her as unwelcomed guest in their home . 

If I was your wife your family wouldn't be the only ones I started recenting and if things keep going down this path, they won't be.    "
673,"So...my mom has end-stage MS. She was diagnosed about 25 years ago. And the end is really really hard and ugly.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I wish. I wish she had written me a letter, all those years ago, that spelled out what she wanted for herself. How she wanted to live, how she wanted to die, what things she was willing to live with and what she was willing to live without. Where she wanted me to be, what she wanted me to do for her, or not do for her.

I was fortunate in that I was about 16 when my mom reached the level of disability your ex is at--I was nearly out the door to college. But even those years would have been better with a plan, because I felt guilt constantly for leaving her side or asking for money during college when I knew finances were tight for mom's health. I still feel guilt, and I see her every day, and my Dad has been at her side every day, sacrificing his own health to care for her, until cancer made it impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

So please, I urge you to make a plan with her. Suggest to her that she gather her hopes and plans, and get together with a lawyer to document her legal preferences. Come up with firm contingencies under which custody will change, and how support will be managed. Meet with a social worker now. Join MS support groups--they are great.

&amp;#x200B;

Love your daughter and be there for her and answer her questions patiently and honestly."
674,"Don’t be upset, OP, if you don’t get a ton of responses. It’s not that a ton of people don’t care, it’s that this person made such an incredibly perfect response, there’s not much more to add. I care! He just nailed it so beautifully. 

(Thank you for being a good person despite your upbringing, OP. &lt;3 )"
675,"Indeed, we all have a moment in our lives where we have to face the reality that our parents are just as flawed and questionable as everyone else in your life. In a lot of ways that is part of becoming an adult, understanding when your individuality and privacy trumps their need for involvement in your general affairs. 

You're around 30, at what point do you make it clear to them you are now an adult. They need to focus on their lives and let you live yours, maybe you have to sit them down and get real."
676,"Do you have an ostomy bag cover? 

Not that your stoma is anything to be ashamed of but having a cover might help make your GF (and yourself) feel more at ease with it since it looks less “medical”. There are lots of Etsy shops that have covers in different colors and patterns if you want something more exciting than plain black. "

&gt;It’s not my fault that you’re dad doesnt work hard enough

So he just revealed himself to be a hypocritical snob who openly spat on your family's hospitality. He just let the mask slip and went full Disney villain. 

There are inevitably people who protest dumping someone over a single offense, but this incident just told you *exactly* who he is. And he's doubling down and showing no regret for what he said. Yeah, I'd salt the earth here. "
679,"Oh look another dude dating a woman a decade younger and acting like an insecure douche. Shock.

You're exes for a reason. Stay that way and lose his number."

681,"Send Nick the following text:

""Not everyone has success born of nepotism and trust funds to finance their lifestyle, Nick. My dad is one of the hardest working people I have ever met and everything he has he earned, including this dump. His hard work also extended to teaching me to respect others for their character rather than their wealth, which is exactly why you've lost my respect. Enjoy the single life in your vacation home.""

Staying with a loser like him is going to cause you issues. You deserve better than him. How can you stay with a rude little boy who doesn't know what hard work is after he insulted the man who worked his ass off to provide for you? He isn't apologizing because he meant it, he isn't sorry. That's how he genuinely feels. Considering you also grew up much less wealthy than him, he obviously feels the same way about you. Guaranteed he thinks your worth comes from the fact you're lucky enough to be with him."
682,"There was a guy who posted like two or three months ago about having a one-night stand with a woman and then he woke up and she was gone and he was freaking out and thinking he killed her while drunk and it was all hilariously stupid.

Turns out she went out to buy them both donuts and he locked her out of the apartment like a dumbass.

I would wait awhile and see what happens before jumping to conclusions.  It's just as likely he left to do some mundane errand and forgot his phone.  "
683,"There might be a bus stop near the potential campgrounds.  I would scout out some locations and ask.  You would probably be surprised by how many families have to resort to campground living.

I’m so sorry that your aunt ended up being a total psycho.  "
684,"Never expect to see that money again. If you’re okay giving it to him, do that."
685,"A lot of people here are probably going to agree with your father, there is a sort of knee jerk reaction to the idea of kids expecting money from their parents. It gets people upset. 

but the reality is that this goes further past the money, it goes into the fact that you're father has creating lies in his head that you're lazy and a failure. Working hard at a career as you described, for little immediate reward, is the opposite of a failure. You are working hard and struggling in the short term, for success in the long term, and you're not whining or complaining and you're seemingly willing to work long hours. 

That is the opposite of a failure, and the opposite of laziness. Sacrificing short term comfortability for eventual long term success is very honorable and good thing to do at your age. 

I don't know what you could possibly say to your dad. But it blows my mind that he has this opinion of you honestly.  "

687,"I'm conflicted because I see both sides. Did you feel like, before your friend passed, that you and your gf were on the same timeline? Because it really doesn't seem like it."
688,"Yeah, this would be a dealbreaker for me. I hate being late, and I would be resentful of both the lateness, my extra stress, and having to manage another grownup's time for them. 

You could go hardcore to see if that changes her behavior. ""GF, the show starts at x, so we need to leave at y. If you aren't ready to go by then, I'll be going alone"" and then don't say another word, simply leave at y time."
689,"You dump the dude who is harassing your brother and find someone who can act his age and treat his girlfriend and her family with the bare minimum amount of respect. Because he not only doesn't respect your brother, he clearly doesn't respect you either. "

691,"Your username says it best: throw the whole boyfriend away.

But also do everything in your power to get your money back! Do his parents understand what happened at all/do you think there's a chance they'd believe your side of things? That seems like your best bet, but I know it may not be feasible. I don't know how much legal recourse you'd have otherwise, but I really do hope you're able to get it back! What a terrible thing to discover"
692,"I'm so sorry you were betrayed like that.

You absolutely and definitely can not ever trust your brother or SIL again.  They are no different than your other abusers.

This sounds weird, but I'm proud of you for lying and keeping up the pretext.  It's the right thing to do in this circumstance, and definitely the safe thing to do.  

Assuming this sets back your plans to leave, just breathe and reset for now.  Continue to think and plan long term, keep everything to yourself (or share only with your bf) and know that you WILL get out of there.

"
693,"Wow. I'm kind of in disbelief that your post doesn't even mention the idea of breaking up with this guy? Because what he's doing is, if not emotional abuse, at least absolutely horrible. I don't get it. He's outright body shaming you, it is abusive. And why is he following loads of Instagram models? He's supposed to be with you? I'm really at a loss here...you shouldn't ever let anyone treat you like this. If I was ever with a girl who actually outright told me that she preferred Instagram models to me and that I'm not attractive unless I be more like them, I would just be like ""oh okay, I'm gonna go now lol, enjoy your life"" 

In answer to your post, nah I wouldn't do anything this guy says. You sound fine the way you are and he sounds like a psychopath..."

You know the girl and you like her.  That is huge!  Her father is incarcerated so I believe that she is eligible for SS benefits of some kind?  I would like into that, it could help you as you make the transition with the move and your husbands career.

The good news about being military is that your health benefits are going to be pretty damn great.  If she ends up needing therapy you'll be able to provide it.  

Also - when you move you will find it easier to make new friends with the other moms.  You'll have playdates and coffees with them and they will be a great resource to you for mothering advice and just plain friendship.

I know this isn't what you imagined your early married life would be like.  On the other hand, what you would be doing is compassionate and giving and your niece (daughter) will be given the life every child ought to have....parents who are grounded and love her.

It'll have hard moments.  Surly teen years!  Fights over cleaning her room or not eating her veggies.  But there will be so many more moments of beauty and love when you get a handmade mothers day card, when you dress her for Halloween or just laying around on family movie night.

This isn't the easiest road but I do believe it is the most rewarding.

Why in the name of god does he think HE knows better than you about your relationships with your parents? this isn't even about your dad, really, it's about your boyfriend going behind your back and deciding that he knows better than you about what's best for you.

Also there’s a ton of “what if’s” that could come up. What if you get stranded? What if the show runs late and you’re exhausted? "
704,"You predicted this was his intent. You warned her that it would happen. Instead of respecting your feelings and opinions, she turned it into a flaw of yours. Called you domineering and completely disregarded you.
 
Then she fucked him.
 
Who cares if he orgasmed or not. She made a choice to disregard your warnings. Then she made a choice to invite him to your home to be alone with him. Then she made a choice to kiss him. Then she made several other choices to escalate the physical cheating until she finally fucked him. Why did she make all of those choices? 
 
Because she wanted to have sex with him.
 
This wasn't something that just happened to her. She wasn't innocently walking down the street when this guy ran a traffic light and hit her. He didn't force her into something she didn't want to do (no matter what excuse she may give or how she may try to explain it away). She made many choices the led to this result because that's what she WANTED. 
 
Then she lied to you. 
 
Then she told several other people about it. And asked them to lie to you.

705,The chance of you actually being able to walk away from your child with no financial responsibilities is slim to none. 
706,"Yeah no... he's training you. He's teaching you to never bring up problematic topics. Either by fighting with you or simply preventing the conversation entirely. How often do you find yourself simply not mentioning something because you know it will cause a fight? Can you disagree and compromise?

When we watch movies, he can't recognize actors he knows if they have drastically changed their hair (e.g. A woman with long flowing hair suddenly has it tied back in a tight bun, he will take time to realize it's the same woman).
    
Maybe you could also practice quickly analyzing people for these other nom-face ""clues"" to their identity so you can practice recognizing people without relying only on face/hair. "
709,"&gt; I am sure it is done with no bad intention 

Nope. You are making excuses for them instead of standing up for your wife. Instead of asking how you can keep the peace you should be asking how you can show your wife that you are a united front. "
710,"&gt; I'm more or less decided that I'll soon be speaking to a divorce lawyer.

I know you want more advice about your colleagues than your wife, but as far as this part, I'd turn ""soon"" into right-fucking-now.

One of the reasons for this is that it relates to your other question regarding how to handle your colleagues: a lawyer will be able to advise you about what you should/shouldn't say to her and to anyone else better than anyone here.

EDIT: In thinking more about this, the divorce lawyer is still immensely important. But, in my contemplation of worst-case scenarios in all this, it is probably worth you seeking representation concerning the investigation itself, and not commenting to anyone until you've consulted said representation (including probably deletion of this post, I'm sorry to say). You need to move forward on this selfishly and urgently to protect yourself, from both a personal and professional standpoint."

712,"God damn, your husband's a champ for that."
713,He has redpiller plans of using you to make her jealous. Go with your gut instinct. I think you were right that something was up.
714,"OP, given that you don't have the evidence anymore, see if you can get him to admit over text message that they were there. E.g., just text him semi-casually (without tipping him off) today:

""Hey, I am still feeling upset about the security cameras that you put in my room and in the bathroom. Can we talk about it more tonight?"" Or something like that. And then even if he doesn't reply, that is *some* evidence that you're not making it up. Best case, he replies and says something like ""I told you, I need those cameras to make me feel safe."""
715,If you found out he had raped a man and he acted the way he behaves around women to you would you still be his friend?

718,"Here's some signs. It's not super likely that all signs will be visible, but if you notice a lot you need to worry.

- He controls all the money, 
- all financial decisions must be his, even when it's given to you specifically for the purpose of pampering yourself. 
- The balance of ""fun money"" is extremely disproportionate. He will often buy things for himself, whereas you are not afforded the same luxury of buying things for yourself. 
- You do not have access to the accounts, or may only have access to an account into which your ""allowance"" is put.
- Your spending is closely monitored, and you may often be asked to explain charged, some of which seem extremely petty (like there being two charges for the supermarket because you went back in to get that milk you forgot)  
- your living expenses are not fully covered by your ""allowance"" You may have had to borrow from friends and family to cover the rest. 
- You may have had to open credit cards to cover the rest, which you cannot possibly pay off because your expenses aren't covered. (much of this money may have then gone to him to manage)
- Money is being hidden from you. You are not informed of the amount your abuser earns, the amounts in the savings accounts, investments, ect. 
- you are often spoken down to, and made to feel as though you are financially incompetent 
- you are completely dependant on him for financial support. 
- you are being emotionally, physically, or verbally abused.
- you have become cut off from friends and family, particularly if they wanted of him being abusive.  

If you feel you are being abused

- Keep a ""go bag"" incase you need to leave quickly. Documents (you and the kids), clothing (you and the kids), money, phone, baby supplies, food (inc. for the kids) basically anything you'd need to grab if you were told ""you have five minutes to get your things."" 
- Look up shelters and services in your area. Many options should be available for a woman with two young children. In your search for resources be sure to look for assistance with daycare/childminding. 
- don't forget that your friends and family are resources too. Some of them will probably have noticed that you may be abused before you did, and be ready to open their homes to you and your children. 
- Stay safe. "
719,That threesome thing where she brought women to your bed without your consent? That is straight up sexual coercion.
720,"""idk if i’m just being a whiny, needy gf but i’m feeling pretty hurt, "" 

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT. You think that expecting your boyfriend to keep plans that you guys made for your anniversary MONTHS in advance is whiny or needy? To me, this line has history. He must have convinced you (or someone else did) that reasonable expectations in a relationship when had by a woman are needy or whiny. They aren't. This is so beyond disrespectful and weird I would never stay and -- I know this sounds harsh-- no one with self-esteem would. "
721,"This is perfect advice. All I want to do is reiterate a few points!  
1) Please *realize you’re an amazing brother* right damn now. You’re immediately jumping to take action to make sure he’s cared for regardless of your fears and feelings of inadequacy. That is HUGE.  
2) Just be there for him when it comes to emotions. Ask him if he’s okay, ask him if he wants to talk, ask him if he wants to binge watch whatever tv show y’all both enjoy together this Friday night. He obviously trusts and admires you, and he’s not six, he’s sixteen. He already has a harsh reality to exist in—he knows nobody is perfect including you. He probably won’t be obsessing over name brand clothes or making sure he’s got Axe body spray. As long as you remind him he’s loved and accepted and *safe* you’re doing a great job!  
3) Don’t waste any time [before] contacting CPS—do it today. It’s very unlikely they’ll force your brother back into your parents’ home. It’s very likely that they’ll take necessary action to get you whatever legal paperwork you need to enroll him in school and allow him medical treatment, and it’s guaranteed that if he stays with you the social workers will get him benefits like this commenter mentioned. It will be like receiving child support, whether from the state or your parents. You’ll have the help financially you need to take care of him. There are even programs in some states that can give you vouchers for utilities and rent in some cases like this!  
4) Grocery shop at the Dollar Tree. I get all of our canned goods, bread, pasta, cleaning supplies, plates and other cooking utensils there for literally $1 or less an item! Then go to a bigger store for meat, produce and dairy.  Don’t be afraid to ask him to get a part time job once things settle down! It’ll be good for him and help you. He will feel like he’s helping and you’ll both be a little less strapped for cash.  
5) Take a deep breath. Then, breathe deeply again. One more time. You’ve got this. You’re both going to be okay. "
722,"I had something similar happening with my then financé. He treated me like I didn't exist for months and was set on leaving. 

Then when I actually accepted that was really happening and moved to my parents place, got with a boy to have some fun, he was suddenly all ""oh I want to try again"". I said yes, moved in again and realized I lost all respect for him during those months. I couldn't do it, I felt trapped and I left for good a few weeks later.

It's my story, and we weren't married. If you chose to stay, go to couples therapy because this won't work well without. And watch things closely, maybe you are better of without him (I was). "
723,"This x1000.  There is a child involved, and a very unstable partner."
724,This. Not invited to spend Labor Day weekend more of a concern than the champs 
725,"The problem here is your boyfriend, if he can't handle growing a backbone to make sure you're treated correctly then he doesn't deserve you. In a relationship you're a team and if you have to go through dealing with this woman on your own then he's not a very good team mate. "
726,"You know how people stop being “just how they are”? By facing consequences for their actions. “That’s just how they are” because you’ve been rolling over to them you’re whole life because you’ve been conditioned to so it allowed them to continue to be “how they are.”

Your normal meter is broken and you need to read the book Out of the Fog to help you recalibrate it. 

Stop letting them be “how they are” and start showing them consequences for shitty behavior."
727,"The fact that you're feeling bad about it means you're doing ok.  Talk to them about it, bring up the notion that you want to repay them, see what they say.  You're a lucky guy."

729,I’d just cautious of if he means it in like “look at all the girls I passed up for you. Now you owe me”  way. But he may just be trying to impress you. I’d say give it a little more time and trust your gut.
730,"Some of these responses are puzzling, but anyway:

You are exclusive and if you are going to be around your friend or continue to talk to, then I would tell your girlfriend. I’d also ask yourself if you want a friend like in your life. She knew about your girlfriend and didn’t care. "
731,"If you think cooking, cleaning, working a part time job and looking after a child is relaxing at home while you go off and do the work - then I understand why she’s getting mad. 

If you do comfy on your wage alone then her wage is just an extra, and there’s no point both working a full time job and then expecting her to continue everything she’s been doing the last year and a half. 

This should also be something you talk about before having a child "
732,"Did you talk to any of the girlfriends who were at the bar with her? Did they say anything? I mean, if your wife had company, someone probably saw if she talked to anyone.

733,"Girl. You are going to get an STD. 

This is just sad. "
734,"&gt; so far they are sticking firm to their plans.

Your daughter is going to give less than zero fucks about Disneyland at her age. This is the easiest ""no thanks"" in grandma history. Your wife should just politely decline, even if they decide to change their mind and invite you. The damage is done as far as I'm concerned. "
735,Time to stop calling her Bestie. She clearly doesn’t think the same.

Firstly, he should have some sympathy and understand why you'd want to do this... if he can't see the importance, I think you should look for a new life partner. You should prioritize YOUR DAD right now and get him the headstone he deserves and screw what your fiancée says. It's YOUR money and YOUR feelings. "
739,Go to the cops.  That's super illegal in a lot of places.  What a piece of shit.
740,"He's nearly 30 years old. How do people like this come to even exist? That a fucking adult needs to be told to take a shower? 

&gt;I should mention Mark has really long hair, which he hasn't cut in about 5 years. I usually love long hair on men, but right now his is disgusting. It's matted into a half-assed dred that stinks badly enough to leave a miasma after he's been in a room. It's made even worse by the fact that he's a smoker.

You're a better woman than me, this level of filth would literally be a dealbreaker for me and I wouldn't even feel bad about it. Gross. "
741,Honestly. I’m not sure what else OP was expecting out of moving with someone after dating them for a couple of weeks. 
742,"I am a female and lost my best friend unexpectedly a few years go, I barely felt capable of handling my emotions and the pressure of anything made me feel more fragile. I was everywhere emotionally and mentally. To tell him they should keep with their timeline is minimizing his trauma. This is her moment to prove she’s wife material by being supportive and being there for him. That’s selfish of her, I would end up resenting her for it personally. "
743,"What he did was 100% not okay, and you should break up with him.

However, for your next boyfriend, you need to rephrase how you describe your instagram. It isn't social media for you, it's a job. His feelings about your job have to be either ""okay with it"" or ""not okay with it"", not ""I'm okay with it, if you could do it less.""

&gt;  I feel like that doesn't fit the vibe of my page since it's not really personal anymore.

Don't say ""not really personal anymore"", say ""its work"". Part of your brand is portraying yourself as flirty and single. That's going to be a problem for a lot of guys, so you have to be upfront about it if it's something you're going to do.

**Edit:** A compromise might be creating a second instagram account for personal use, that you *do* post pictures of your boyfriend on. An example to look at is @indiesunshine and her personal page, @itmemoni. But plenty of instagram models, from @taramilktea with 1.1 mil to @thy.time with 28k, have successful pages that prominently feature their boyfriends and other close friends. "
744,"What did your boyfriend say *to her* in response? I'm not clear on whether he told her he was in no way interested or whether he said that to you, and that very much changes how I'd feel about this if I were in your position."

746,"No I've never heard about her until now. Thank you so much, I will look her up at once."
747,"Why do so many girls on here post about having dirty boyfriends? Ugh, dump him and go find someone who actually cleans themselves."
748,I have to agree with you here. You can't really control how you feel sometimes and god forbid that you find other people attractive sigh. Im not sure this will work. He should have discussed this with you and not went snooping. The trust is gone. Your respect towards him is gone. I don't think this will ever work out
749,"The is clearly a date and boyfriend is being deliberately obtuse about it.  

There’s no good reason not to make this clear up front.  There are plenty of bad reasons why he would choose not to."
750,"Do not go to grad school unless an employer pays for it, or you win enough scholarships/grants to cover the costs you can’t pay out-of-pocket. 

Come on, OP. Did you not learn your lesson the first time? You need to be *goddamn allergic* to additional debt at this point. Your husband has been more than generous in helping you pay off 100k in foolishly obtained loans. I’d be side-eyeing your merits as a life partner too if you came to me with a plan to take on another 70k of debt because you’re bored. 

Find a way to market the skills you’ve acquired and leverage them into a job at a company with tuition reimbursement. It may not pay much more in gross salary, but you’ll be able to come up with a feasible career plan and avoid putting yourself back into a financial black hole. Do not just dive into grad school assuming it’ll fix all your problems. You can ask all the master’s degrees driving for Lyft how that worked out."
751,"I consider his taking control of your social media accounts a major boundary breach, and IMO you should too, especially since you're building a livelihood around this. If you had a 'traditional' job that included emails or messages from men and he disliked that, it would be totally unacceptable for him to delete or interfere with them. I know social media is more personal and you aren't totally living off this, but you and he need to both start seeing this as a money making venture. 

I also consider his suggesting you look vain or slutty to be inappropriate treatment of you. It is an indirect insult - he didn't say you ARE vain or slutty but it isn't too far off. He does not sound supportive or understanding at all. 

At a minimum, you need to prevent him from deleting posts and changing your account. It's simply unacceptable. Tell him if it happens again, you're done (AND MEAN IT). If it's a dealbreaker for him how much you use social media or how you use it, he should walk away, not have a tantrum and try to control you. "

755,"This seems to be more about her having strong feelings about her history with ex partners giving her fake diamonds than her being materialistic.

You might find this difficult to move past, and if it was me I would not push the issue. You are giving a gift to her, and the feelings of the gift recipient should be the primary concern, not those of the gift giver. "

757,"Funny that you're a push over for not wanting to ruin your relationship with your parents but you wouldn't be a push over if you gave in to his demands.

It sounds like you're not ready to move in and this douche is trying to manipulate you into doing what he wants.

Does he usually pout and manipulate you into doing what he wants?"
758,"I've been thinking about finding a therapist just to help me deal with the guilt of having to cut her off. I've had to do it before in our relationship; we once went like 8 months without speaking because she wouldn't stop saying shitty things about my dad to me. It's so hard because she wasn't like, a terrible mom or beat us or anything she just makes me miserable &amp; I can't deal with it anymore. "
759,"My dad was the same, my mom ""stayed together for the kids"" don't do this, your kids will love him until they're old enough understand that you deserve better, then they'll lose respect for him, better to raise a child with a male role model who treats you like he should do they have an example of how to be a good man and or how a good man will treat them."
760,"Yeah cmon man, pull your socks up. You’re literally prioritising a stranger’s feelings over your partner’s. Don’t be that guy! "
761,"So you told her that she could make changes, just assumed she could read your mind about what changes you would find acceptable without further conversation, and now it’s somehow her fault that you don’t like what she did with *your* apartment. It took me two readings to even realize that she was definitely living there because you were so specific about it being *your* apartment. Just based on that alone, I definitely think your friend is on the right track. 

The only valid complaint you have is the office(and only the office, if you get one room that is yours and yours alone to decide the purpose of, so does she, even if the purpose she picks is a guest room). And given that she’s moved her whole life to be with you, I think you can get over some paint and furniture changes in the rest of the house. "
762,"Thank you, I'm glad that it worked out as well. My insecurities were making me really paranoid. I was losing faith in our relationship and blamed myself but now that I've talked with her about it and thought about it more, I was over-thinking a lot of things. 


When we went back to my dorm, we had a heart-to-heart talk about our relationship and it gave me a lot of clarity. I'm more than 100% convinced she loves me with all of her heart. "
763,"&gt; My mom believes that if I say the right things that

Oh God. No. This thinking is highly emotional, which is fair. But, it is not reality. Just nod until she clears her head. But, forget all that. 

You are right, this is your family, and ramifications could last decades. So, even though you love your friends, I don't think you need to rush the cat out of the bag. I think you should get a counsellor. You need someone to talk to, end of. Get a pro to help you unload. Your friends don't benefit and aren't qualified to help in that regard anyway. No need to stress them out..

If you want to tell your friends, that's up to you. This is something that happened to you, nobody owns it. You can. But, you should honestly wait until you process it with a counsellor first. That way you don't go off sounding irrational like your mom, talking at the highest emotional time. That kind of stuff is hard for your friends. They can't tell you that you are wrong. They can't stop of you from doing things that will be bad for you... 

You get it.. get a pro. That's going to guide points one, two, and help you through the list that grows from there."

yeah, ok.  first time my ass.    i bet this guy picks up men all the time and has sex with them behind his gf's back.  

you gotta take care of yourself on this one.  your cousin will find out what kind of guy she's dating sooner or later by some other means.  i'm guessing sooner, because this asshole is bold enough to cheat on his gf with her own cousin."

767,"You may also have a legal case against her for failure to provide a 30 day notice to vacate. If you have claimed the residence as your home (ie do you get your mail there?), then she had to file a proper eviction for 30 day notice. Verify with your state law, but you may have a case there as well. I’d also refuse to pay any other bills before you leave. "
768,"&gt; It not an ""Oh, gross!"" thing, it's more of a ""Am I going to hurt him? What if we accidentally pull it out? What if we tear something?"" thing. 

This so much.

I would honestly be *terrified* of having sex after a partner had a major surgery, doubly so if the surgery involved having something external to the body like that. I would honestly be really scared of accidentally snagging on it, ripping it out, etc. 

I think OP definitely needs to give it more time for the ""new normal"" to set in. Also, therapy isn't a bad idea for him. This is a major surgery, and one that definitely can be hard for you to adjust to. There's no shame in getting some help for the stuff you're feeling &amp; going through."
769,"so the guy doesn’t want to tell new girl on the block that he has a gf. the guy also doesn’t want to tell the new girl that it isn’t a date. the guy also doesn’t want anyone else to be present during this “non-date”. i feel very sorry for your gf, as well as you. your girlfriend will be uncomfortable to say the least if u go ahead wih this “non-date”. what is it that you seek from this other girl? what’s so great about her? if you’re unhappy in your relationship then just leave. feelings matter bro.

770,"This isn't all that uncommon. The woman will end up being in a bunch of photos and meeting their closest friends and family. If it's not a serious think, it would be kind of awkward.

Notice how you can provide specific details about what went wrong, but generalize the parts where everything goes well? Or how she did this thing that was bad but otherwise everything else was great! Yeah, you've got them rose coloured glasses buddy



Truth is she was never good for you, the relationship was never healthy, 'anna' is not to blame here; she was only a catalyst. You deserve better."
773,"So the women in the photos were also teenagers? Under the age of 18? So he has been in possession and masturbating to child pornography?

Yeah I don't think I could get past that. "
774,"Like a child, he is only interested in his toys when they're about to be taken away.  It's no coincidence he became a lot more interested in reconciliation only after it occurred to him that you were about to move on.  Expect that interest to evaporate as soon as you appear okay with going back to the status quo of being his celibate roommate."
775,Aww that was an unexpectedly really sweet story. It seems like your husband really loves you.
776,"Jesus Christ, that is horrifying.

The best thing you can do for this girl is encourage her to get into some sort of therapeutic setting. She's going to need a lot of it to help process her abusive past.

777,"This would be a total dealbreaker for me. I'm not the tidiest person in the world by any means, I can live with a bit of clutter and I'll let dishes sit for a day before I deal with them sometimes. But that sounds like too much for me. The fact is, most people will do a decent tidy before someone they want to impress comes over. It doesn't even sound like what he's got going on would take more than a couple of hours maximum to get it to the point of being actually clean and presentable if he put some effort into it. But he hasn't and I'd find that kinda disrespectful in a way. Or, alternatively, this IS what it's like after he tries to tidy, in which case, imagine how bad it is when you're not around."
778,"This sounds like a mental breakdown with full on hallucinations and delusions. She needs medical help. Not sure where you are from and what the local law is, but she appears to be a danger to herself/others and thus may require sectioning. "

He will pretend to understand and maybe seem apologetic during the session, and then things will become worse afterwards. This bridge needs to be burned. Laptop needs to be reset to factory settings. Maybe search around for how to find if he's got a keylogger (is that the right term?) downloaded on the laptop and how to go about getting rid of it. Find someone tech savvy. Take this to the police if he has done that "
780,"I'm seeing 10'x20' 3-room tents for $110. You and your husband could have your own room, the kids could have a room, and you would still have a common area. Plus outside.

He wants you to be afraid of him and do what he wants when he wants how he wants you to do it.

He didn't ""raise his hand"" - he threatened you. This was a test. And you forgave him. The next test will be worse. Do you want to be there when he escalates this?"
783,"I was in this same position so I understand. I found that when I chose to cut the friendship a lot of people made out I was the asshole, that I should be there for her and it wasn't her fault she was being controlled by someone else so therefore the way she behaved towards me was suddenly acceptable. It took years but one day I realised something. I don't owe anyone anything. Not a damn thing. 

She would get in abusive relationship after abusive relationship. In each one I would get constant messages and phone calls that she wanted to leave him, that she had come to her senses, and even text messages that she was at a bridge and she was going to jump, she had a knife and was cutting her wrists. She would send them at stupid o'clock in the morning and leave voicemails screaming at me about why I wasn't answering the phone when she needed me and wasn't I supposed to be her best friend? Then the relationship would end she would promise it wouldn't happen again then she would go straight into another one with another abuser and the cycle would start again. It got so exhausting I told my mum I wanted to cut her out my life and I got the ""you can't do that, she needs you, you're supposed to be her best friend, she be is vulnerable and it's not her fault"". One day she woke me at 2am screaming she was going to kill herself and then the next day said she was fine and overreacted to an argument her and the bf had (he gave her a black eye and grab bruises all down her arm though). It was the last straw. I snapped. Do you know what, I'm not responsible for her. She is a grown ass adult like me. Do you know what it is when you're constantly guilted into being someone emotional crutch? It's called emotional abuse mate. She has never ever considered what she was doing to me. She has never owned up to the shit she put me through or the danger she put me in everytime she allowed him near me when he was drunk and angry after promising me he wouldn't be there. Do you know what else me CONSTANTLY being there was doing? Enabling her. Because she knew silly little idiot me would always be there. 

I didnt deserve to be treated like that. People who have never dealt with being the emotional crutch can sit in their fucking guilded house and look down their noses, they will never know what it's like being that person who is constantly being made responsible for someone elses emotional or physical safety. 

You have every right to cut someone from your life when they put you in danger or exploit and abuse your emotions.  Has she ever apologised for what she put YOU through? Or is the sympathy just for HER? Is everything about HER? Is it HER that's sad? Is it HER that doesn't agree with you cutting HER. Don't you know that SHE needs you? Bet she has never asked you how it felt for you right? All those messages. Those calls to the police. Being there to give her a safe place. Bringing danger into your house. How emotionally taxing the constant worrying was. How much it hurts when they don't give a fuck about you when they don't need you. No. You don't deserve that.  People will call you a bitch and heartless. Forget them. They don't know what it was like for you.

Apologies for the long post. This one hits close to home for me."
784,Definitely talk to a lawyer first. I've heard in some places leaving the marital home during a separation can affect your claim on it during the divorce. You don't want to get caught by nasty legal surprises like that.
785,I guess this sounds like us I just never thought of its abuse...
786,"From everything you've described, you are being financially abused.

* You are a SAHM, meaning you don't earn your own money.
* Your husband claims that they money he earns at his job belongs to him (even though this is legally untrue. Any money he earns belongs to both of you). 
* He spent the only money you DID have to spend on yourself, on him.


Do you have access to your his bank accounts? Who pays the bills? Are you allowed to go buy clothes or anything for yourself? What decisions do you make in terms of what gets bought for the household? How aware are you of your guys' finances (for example, do you know how much money he makes, do you know what you pay for various bills, do you know how much you guys have in savings, and/or retirement?)"
787,"I wouldn't. Her complaining and lack of preperation for this trip already reflects poorly on her.
It sounds like her m.o. is to guilt people into compliance, and at 60 I doubt confronting her will change that. You do you and don't her guilt you into being her babysitter.

"
788,"Wonder how it feels to be Richard having two people responsible for kicking him off a trip intended for **15 friends** and having only one person know the truth.

You can trust her while still verifying. Unless he did something majorly fucked up, there's no reason he couldn't have came and they just kept their distance from each other. Yeah, you should have gotten both sides before rushing in to play defender. Just because she has been there *for you* doesn't mean she's incapable of petty arguments with other people, and just because you trust her judgment doesn't mean you can't use your own. But too late now, he's uninvited and you don't even know why. Celebratory high-fives all around!"
789,"What he did is illegal in many states, it is called reproductive coercion. "
790,"People who have been “raised right” often don’t understand how even though it’s completely screwed up, it’s your normal. 

I don’t think there’s much you can do about it, it’s your life, your history, your stuff. If it matters to you to cleanse yourself of your ill gotten goods, I’d say start donating it and buy new ones. But that’s pretty wasteful and pointless if it doesn’t bother you. If it bothers him I don’t know that there’s much you can do about it. "
791,"Hi - I'm a straight, single female who is best friends with a straight male in a relationship. 

The day you described is not necessarily a ""date"" just because she's a girl, so I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with *what* they did together, especially if they are best friends. I frequently spend days like this with my best friends, both male and female. The activities are not the red flag. 

 Also, it doesn't really matter whether she has a boyfriend or not, frankly, because that isn't going to stop anyone if their relationship is inappropriate. Here's the deal - my best friend and I have both been single at the same time before, and still never dated or fooled around with each other. We don't ever sleep in the same bed, if I think a pretty good gauge is that if we ever did, I'm 100% confident nothing would happen - just like I am 100% confident nothing would happen if I'm sleeping in a bed with my girlfriends.  If the only thing keep you from being with your friend of the opposite sex is their significant other, then you aren't really actually friends.. 

In my view, though, there are definitely a few red flags: 

1. **You have been dating this guy a year and never met her** \- I meet every girlfriend my best friend ever has almost immediately to help diffuse tension and make her comfortable with our friendship. You should be upset that he hasn't introduced you to someone who is important to him, who he likes enough to spend a whole day with. 
2. **He's cheated on you before**, which doesn't necessarily mean that he's cheating on you with her, but he should care more about making you feel comfortable with her - again, the simple way to do this would just be to introduce you to her, or invite you to hang out with them. I just don't understand why he wouldn't do that. 
3. **He chose to spend a whole day with her over you.** This is weird to me. My best friend and I often hang out just the two of us, but not usually for a whole day and especially not if they're dating someone else. You don't want to bail on your friends if you have rigid plans, like a baseball game or whatever, but it seems like they had a leisurely do whatever day. There was really no reason why they couldn't have cut it short so he could see you too. My best friend and I regularly do this - it's not choosing the significant other over the friendship - it's balancing the two relationships. 

So, yes, tell him it makes you uncomfortable. Insist on meeting her - you should want to meet his friends, and he should be excited to introduce you to his friends. Also, be wary of this friendship because it doesn't seem totally innocent to me.

792,He works from home. Otherwise someone probably would have mentioned this a long time ago.
793,"I'm sorry you're going through this sister. 

It sucks. It really does. It hurts. We always try again, hoping for the best. We look at our friends, and family, and colleagues, and see them in happy thriving relationships, and think ""Why can't I have that too?"" So even though we've sworn off relationships forever, and written down our favorite names for the inevitable nineteen cats that will occupy our homes instead of a spouse, we end up warming up little by little. 

First we thought our innocence was gone.. We could never put ourselves through it again.. But we meet someone.. They seem so great. They remind us that happiness goes on. We grow close to them. And then we see the greatest miracle of all. Just how much we need them... And that beautiful reciprocation when we see how much they need us too!!! That hasn't happened for the longest time! 

We want to be cautious.. The pain is fresh. We don't want to go through that again.. But that person ends up making us second guess those doubts. Who knows how far we can go on? Will we be sorry when they're gone? But you know what? We take those chances, because we forgot how nice romance is.. 

Maybe it works. Maybe it doesn't... So I guess it just depends on how you feel about gambling. Sure, losing hurts. But winning feels so good. And we can't win if we don't play.. So is it worth taking some chances and maybe losing a few more times if it means we might win in the end? 

Also.. As I've typed this out, I think it sounds really dumb. I'm having an episode of insomnia, and am sleep deprived. I've spent a while typing, so I'm going to post it anyways.

So with that said, I really do wish you the best of luck mam. I know I'm just some guy on the internet, but hopefully the fact that I'm rooting for you to do well in love, and in life is some consolation. "
794,"""nearly evicted out of several places for various reasons""

This line stood out to me, can you expand on it? What reasons? It's not common to be ""nearly evicted"", let alone multiple times. "
795,"No, you're not wrong. Accepting someones freedom to do what they want and being attracted to their choices are two entirely different things. You can't control the fact you're not attracted to men in drag, and if you don't want your boyfriend to suddenly start wearing make-up that's entirely reasonable.

He's not doing anything wrong either and he should be able to do what he wants as long as it isn't hurting anyone, but if this is a dealbreaker for you then that's fine. This isn't an issue of you not being progressive enough or anything like that, you simply aren't physically into dudes who dress up as women.

You shouldn't try to keep him from doing it, but you should tell him honestly how you feel and then make a choice that's best for you."
796,"&gt; you don't have to be friends just because you're family

I kind of agree with this. I also agree that not every conversation has to be A Thing, that it's the little things like ""How are you?"" and just shooting the shit with people that develop connections. 

Do you have a tendency to try and command the stage in conversations with them, to shape and direct the chat in a way that sets you up as the expert or leader? Do you do this with friends, or just with family?"

800,"What has attracted you to him? There are no redeeming qualities at all in your post. If they ever existed, they are long gone now. You know what you have to do, and you have this forum's blessing to do it."
801,"It's likely so ingrained within her that it'll take a considerable amount of therapy to work through it. It's tougher with scars, because they're constant reminders of what one goes through.

My advice would be don't bring them up unless she does. Carry on as if they don't exist.  If she does bring them up, just reassure her that they don't change how you view her."
802,"Yeah, I think it’s more than mental illness at this point. He’s an asshole. "
803,"You two don’t sound compatible. She found that she likes going out with her friends and having big a few drinks and that’s not something you want to do. Neither of you are wrong, but if you don’t learn to accept that she is going to continue with this activity, you’ll most likely lose her. This is your problem. You can’t control her activities. I don’t know how you can change the way you feel. You probably cant, which means you would probably be better of finding a girlfriend that doesn’t like to party. "
804,"Whether you decide to continue a romantic relationship with your girlfriend or not is besides the point that you made the decision of having unprotected sex. “SHE got pregnant because SHE missed her bc shot”. Sounds a lot like you’re trying to blame this pregnancy on her. When it takes TWO people to make a baby. If YOU didn’t want a baby then YOU should have made sure YOU were also using protection. It seems like she is taking responsibility for her actions and you should be as well. I’m sure you knew the consequences of having unprotected sex, and if you were man enough to have unprotected sex then you should be man enough to be a father to that child. The unborn child should not have to pay for your actions. "
805,"Found the reason she's with you. 

Sorry OP. You can do a million times better than this "
806,"She’s jealous of you. Don’t go, and write her off. I recently had to do this with someone. It sucks but it happens and you’re better off without this drama in your life. “Hey, I can’t make it. Sorry. Bye.” You owe her nothing.  Let her retaliate. Don’t react. "
807,"Yeah, this isn't about avoiding conflict. it's about avoiding compromise."
808,"A person can be bad for you without beating you, and emotionally abuse can include manipulation and various other things that don't seem obviously abusive at first glance. I think a therapist could really help."
809,"I think *somebody* grabbed her ass at the bar and asked to have sex with her, and it bothered her a lot. In the dark/intoxicated it kind of looked like your cousin, so then she’s upset and angry and she comes to you to tell you what happened. Obviously you’re like “wtf that is not my cousin”, but she has a hard time taking that rationally. I think she wanted you to comfort her and be angry on her behalf— basically, to be on “her side”. And now it feels like you’re not on “her side”- in fact, to her you’re doing the opposite by proving her wrong - but she’s embarrassed and just wants to pretend it didn’t happen because nowhere here did things go the way she wanted, and she can’t get mad at you for correctly locating your cousin but she also doesn’t feel satisfied with how you handled the situation. 


I’m not saying either of you are right or wrong, or that I know what your wife is thinking. That’s just my read on the situation, and maybe could help explain why your wife’s behavior seems so confusing. "
810,"My dude. All I get from this is that the communication in your relationship is shit.

Here’s the sequence of events:
You’re asked for the SSN. You don’t tell your wife about this request. You don’t reject the request, you say “we’ll do it later” while intending not to go through with it.
Because your answer is “I’m busy, let’s do it later” the request reaches your wife. 
Because you didn’t share any of this with your wife, and she’s asked by a mother figure she trusts, she agrees to it. Since you never told her about the initial request, she doesn’t have the necessary information (about what it’s for or how you feel about it) to reject it.

Neither of you talked to each other. You both saw it natural to make your own decisions without involving your partner.

You need to work on communicating with each other. Seriously. "
811,"I have not tried befriending her. I’ve never met her or been offered the chance to meet her. Some of his other female friends who I am also friends with have met her and become part of the friend group...but not me. 

I did take his regifting the bottle to be quite insulting, though I do understand he may have seen it differently, as it was a last minute invite. "
812,"This is like your job just fired you, but expects you to remain available to pick up shifts."
813,"It sounds like you've been waving flags for a long time. You have to start making some decisions for you, before she actually decides that getting pregnant and being a stay at home parent is her next career. She has a cushy spot now, i can definitely see why she doesn't want to leave.

It's going to hurt regardless of how you express it. Because it's a giant pile of problems that have gone on without being addressed. Sunk costs fallacy is however a bad reason to continue. There will only be more issues and fewer wishes realized if you keep quiet or continue this relationship at this rate."

815,"I could be harsh but I say you did the right thing. You tried and tried and tried and she threw it in your face the second he was brought into your house and quite frankly, endangering you."
816,Good luck OP. While the dancing stuff has been addressed to a reasonable extent you still need to address the home aspect and him going out way way too many times a week. I go to the gym less than he does and I'm single without a kid. Also he needs to parent your 15 month old more. Long road ahead.
817,"I think the bullies get an out if this path is taken. OP doesn’t have to confront them if she doesn’t want to, but she shouldn’t have to avoid them either. If she has it in her she should say she got that bear from the funeral home during the very recent passing of her father and it’s helping her cope in this very hard time and then watch their faces turn to mush. "
818,"&gt;Not to mention regular babysittings we have to do at our place when they go somewhere.

It’s ok to babysit to help your siblings out, but this should be on your terms, not theirs. It’s ok to say no, and when you do, offer no reason or explanation. “Sorry, I can’t do it today!” Nothing more. They are not your children, so there is no *have* to in this scenario. 

&gt;They run around and nobody reacts expecting us to do it. 

Don’t do it. I know it’s hard to ignore feelings of responsibility, but you have to remind yourself that their children are not your obligation. Be helpful to the extent at which you’re comfortable, play with and love those babes, but it’s not your responsibility to care for and discipline them unless they are solely in your care at the time. 

Obviously, this is all easier said than done, but if they won’t listen to a reasonable conversation about it, simply stop engaging. You have to set boundaries, and if people can’t respect those, it’s your responsibility to enforce them whatever way you’re able. "
819,"&gt;  I even ended up in a buzzfeed article (without my consent)

Media outlets are supposed to get people to sign releases before posting their pictures. Who took the pictures? It sounds like it wasn't your manager. The person who took the pictures owns the pictures, and you could get them taken down, if it bothers you that much, based on a copyright violation."
820,"Maybe I missed it, but where is his compromise? What has he compromised on here at all?

&gt; He said he would happily not do the late drinking or stay out new years eve if i was to stop dancing as he did not want to lose his wife, but felt that perhaps ""he has already lost me.""

Sounds like he hasn't agreed to not go out drinking."
821,"If you can't change your behavior, you can always change your boyfriend.  Your problem is pretty unusual, but it's a failure of empathy on his part that he can't get past that is a known issue you have, and even mocks and antagonizes you for it.  Imagine if you had a limp, and everytime you couldn't keep up with him in public he yelled at you to go faster, caricatured how you walked, and punished you for not being capable of walking without one.  Would you tolerate that?  If you saw someone else doing that to someone, would you think the guy was a gigantic douchebag?

If you're doing everything in your power to correct or prevent your smiling from happening, he doesn't really get to react the way he does.  As he does it anyway, I think what we have here is an implacable incompatibility between you two."
822,"Well, it’s good that the money is actually there.

But if he won’t give it back willingly, you’re still going to have to look at your legal options to get it back. He has shown that he is not to be trusted, so be careful."
823,"&gt;I spent the day with Ben and Em, they talked me through what I should do. They believe the relationship is toxic and this is a massive red flag. I am inclined to agree, but I don't know. Maybe I'm jumping the gun because I'm upset.

Your friends are thinking clearly and giving your great advice. They are truly supportive of you and want the best of you.

You should listen to them - Josh's behavior is absolutely unacceptable and since you come from an abusive family, you might not have the best instincts here. Your friends see this situation more clearly than you can since growing up with your father has influenced you to think that terrible toxic behavior is normal.

Don't spend any of your energy trying to diagnose Josh, or trying to figure out what his deal is. You don't have energy to spare for him. Please break up with him, let him know to not contact you anymore, and concentrate on spending time with your friends, your school work, and healing from this emotional blow to your family."
824,My mom is. I'm very fortunate for her. My issue is how to move on mentally. All I do is reiterate what he's called me. I used to be 100 lbs overweight and had way more confidence. The thought of leaving seems impossible. I feel like I don't know myself anymore. 
825,"Yeah I am really just reeling from it, and I don't know how to go back to normal. I also am worried about her.

&amp;#x200B;

I would do the dinner, but I worry it could be tactless if she's below the poverty line and money is really all she needs.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of just creating some extra cleaning tasks, like maybe we deep clean my closets for a weekend, or maybe we organize my spare bedroom--so she had a way to work for the money.

&amp;#x200B;

I also feel so awkward since as my housekeeper, she sees what I buy/do. So she can see I shopped at Whole Foods and bought salmon, or she can see that I bought my cat's a stupid $200 cat tree last week. So she knows I have the money and means, so it's  basically like I said no you're not worth that. Even if she acted super kind, it could have hurt a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

I am probably overthinking, I have anxiety, I just... have never been asked for money in my life at this level.

&amp;#x200B;

827,"Frankly it sounds like Apple might enjoy being a sugar baby instead of forging a serious relationship at this time but there's a major stigma against the situation which pressures her to pretend to hate it. Alternatively, Apple truly does hate the situation but lacks the social maturity and self-confidence needed to end things or directly confront the guy. 


Whatever the case, you tried to help and she didn't listen. That's really the crux of the matter. Move on."
828,"It is not OK that he told a friend they could stay with you, without consulting you, his live-in girlfriend, first. It's DEFINITELY not OK that he full-on cuddled with her right in front of you. Even if he explicitly asked first and you said yes to it (which didn't happen), it still shows a huge disregard for your feelings! What are you to him, his loyal labrador? No, no. As someone who was once guilt-tripped into a polyamorous relationship once (which failed miserably as you can imagine), I want you to know you do not have to agree with anything that makes you feel shitty. And he needs to honor that. 

Yes, I (29F) cuddle my platonic friends too, I used to more, but I don't cuddle my straight male friends anymore even though I adore them and am comfortable with them- because I love my boyfriend and I don't want to make him the slightest bit uneasy. It's not that hard. They already traveled together, they already get to be close without you getting upset about that, he really needs to appreciate how straight-up giving and reasonable you are! You absolutely have the right to feel every bit of how you're feeling. I hope you put your foot down. Good luck. &lt;3"
829,"Nice shiny spine there. I didn't hear anything that sounded like she made a positive contribution to your life. 

Ya did good!"
830,I was waiting for the crazy drug dealing ex to be yet another layer of lies. It sounds like the over the top evil boyfriend in a bad teen movie. The fact that said crazy drug dealing ex actually existed would almost be hilarious if it didn't intersect with your life. That whole situation is a ball of drama that you'd be wise to keep away from. 
831,"I think when someone tells you who they are, you should listen. This is a red flag for sure. "
832,"There's not necessarily a ""normal"" amount, but what stuck out to me is that you say ""when he is yelling at me."" He shouldn't be yelling at you. Voices might be raised in the heat of the moment, but the fact that you've been together less than a year and it happens enough that you speak about it as a fact of your relationship and not a once-or-twice incident is very concerning.

It's okay to fight, but you need to fight fair if you care about someone. Him yelling at you, mocking you, and calling you a liar about your tic are NOT fair fighting tactics and the normal amount that those should be present in a relationship is not at all."
833,"It hurts my soul that *so many* of the posts here are early 20's women and mid- to late-30's (or older) men. These girls are clueless (understandably so!) and the men are at best subconsciously predatory.

If I were OP I'd be out of there in the next five minutes and date somebody my own age."
834,"Maybe he has hearing problems. Is there anyone else around you guys to re-affirm that he speaks loudly?

"
835,"Jon is a snake who’s downplaying your boyfriend so he can get in those cheeks after you fall so far in the rabbit hole you end up breaking up with your bf.

Then here comes Jon, “I told you so, what are you doing tonight, let’s talk about.”

Jon is a home wrecker in disguise — remove that negativity from your life. "
836,"&gt;He told me that he couldn't sleep, so he reached over, squirted lube on his fingers, and inserted them inside me. I freaked out and told him I didn't want to have sex, then left the room to calm down. His response to me was that he REALLY needed to have sex.

Jesus fucking christ. What a literal barbarian buffoon. Is he a fucking cave man? What the actual fuck. No consideration. Not even CONSENT! 

Sorry but this is some pretty pathetic behavior from a partner. The only levity is that maybe he isn't outright malicious. He seems more obtuse and stupid. Like fucking egregiously obtuse. Which isn't a good thing. People generally prefer smart and considerate partners.

Doesn't make a difference in his actions though. 

He sexually violated you by digitally penetrating you like that. Like jesus christ he's LITERALLY treating you like an object.. and didn't bother to get your consent.

I wouldn't even bother with a person with such sensibilities. I mean jesus, like you have to teach another grown person why that's wrong? Fuck that. That's so stupid.

Ok sorry I have no solutions. Just wanted to throw in my perspective for reference. Rant over."
837,You need to get angry and start getting your ducks in a row.  Speak to an attorney and be honest about your suicide attempt and how that will affect custody.  She sounds like the kind of person who will screw you over In a divorce just to keep the money rolling in. You need to get ready to fight if for no other reason than your kids Op.
838,"Cleaned up for a family-friendly audience:

“I’m sorry that I responded to your bullying by taking your glasses. When you stole my gift and called me ugly, I should have been the better person, but I stooped to your level and that was wrong of me.”"
839,"Have you sat him down and told him everything you have written in this post? In detail? No beating around the bush. He needs to hear all of it including how it’s making you feel (wanting to leave). A big misconception that working outside the home husbands get, is that staying home with the baby isn’t a full time job. IT’S SO HARD AND IS A FULL TIME JOB.  It’s a 24 hours a day 7 days a week full time job. No break. No sleep. More than a 40 hour work week or something similar to. It makes me SO mad to see the significant other think it’s not. On top of physical &amp; lack of sleep, it’s mentally draining. No breaks (and for some not much adult interaction or contact) can drive one crazy!  

Girl why haven’t you woken his butt up and handed him the baby in the night for a shift?! Also I CANNOT believe you’re on the couch!!!! Sleep in your own bed with the baby next to you and if he wants sleep he can go to the couch or wherever. Hopefully he helps and doesn’t just move to another place to sleep. "
840,"People go to school while married. In fact, if you're talking about grad school I bet that more than 50% of your classmates would be married. People earning less than 7-8k/month raise families (and if you're in the US then less than half of all households earn that). I think you're making excuses because you're not willing or ready to commit. I think that at age 30, you should know after a year of dating if you're interested in marriage. Maybe not immediately, but you should know if it's likely or not likely to interest you. This whole ""I need more time, I wish we had more time"" vibe sounds to me like you *don't* want to get married but are hoping something could happen to change your mind (stable career, more income, whatever). Which is fine, but you need to be honest about that and don't lead her on."
841,"You DO know. He watches and he records footage.

Normally, I'm not one to push calling for the police, but this is outrageous and he needs to be arrested ASAP. Even if you lost a lot of evidence, at least file a report, your testimony is evidence (I think, IANAL). Peeping is a precursor to rape/sexual assault.

Also tell your landlord and follow all the other good advice here.
"
842,"&gt;""It was going to say ""HELP HER"" as a reminder to keep you safe. I did it for us.""

That speaks to me of profoundly troubled judgment, not just as an action of itself but also in the context. Enough so that I think you're right to step back and wonder if this is the person you want to be in a relationship with considering everythign that's going on in your life. He'd have to demonstrate some real understandingand thought if he wanted to come back from that."
843,"Okay, this is what you need to take to heart. I was BFFs with a girl who was the ""friend"" in this situation. Let me tell you, you don't stand a chance. He's with you because she won't be with him. That's what it is. If he wasn't into her, you'd have met her. If she decides she wants him, she'll have him.
"
844,"It's fair to bring it to him, and be a little vulnerable. You can share with him your worry that she has changed her tune, and your fear that he might respond to her, and your hope that he feels solidly about your relationship. You can listen to him and invite him to share- he might feel annoyed, or hurt, or like she's playing. Either way, communication can help you orient to the truth and quiet some of the stories you might be telling yourself. And, honest, open, non-defensive communication is something you uniquely can offer him. "
845,"Your boyfriend badly violated your boundaries. It doesn't matter what his ""intentions"" are. He had no business going behind your back to do something you didn't want. And if he even thinks connecting you with your dad is a good thing, he's clearly not listening to you or respecting you. You can't have a relationship with someone who does this to you. "
846,"Ugh this is such baby boomer bullshit. Your father was born into a generation of unprecedented upward mobility, and you were born into a downwardly mobile generation (with prospects diminished by the baby boomers themselves). Also we live in an information economy, not a physical labor-based one, so no gender has an inherent advantage--why are men supposed to work harder??

But yeah, you asking him for help would only reinforce his incredibly stupid opinion. I would try to distance yourself from him, but there's not much to do about the money. (Unless you wanted to start a small business? Based on his thought process, I could see him investing in that, but not giving you any help otherwise.)"
847,"&gt; I have still not heard from my parents, but this morning we found out he sent a message to the friend again, saying that she twisted the facts and exaggerated everything.

Your father is harassing your wife's friend but you're still waiting around to be contacted by your parents? Dude, fuck that. Call your parent and tell them how inappropriate they're being. Tell them to stop contacting your wife's friend. I feel sorry your wife and her friend have to deal with this nonsense, not only from your parents but from you as well."

849,"I’m not a lawyer, but my understanding is that the DA decides who to prosecute. It’s not up to the mom. Once she called the police, she doesn’t really get a say in what happens to the person she’s accusing. 

So the DA had enough to prosecute and clearly had enough to push for jail time. 

This would be too much for me."
850,"This woman doesn't want you to be a ""minion wage slave"" working for a salary at some company. But guess what? You are a slave, right now. A slave to her. You don't even have the resources to get to the airport, let alone buy a ticket home. You might as well have shackles on both ankles.

This is insane. You've forfeited all your personal agency here to be an ornament on the shelf of this ""perfect woman"" with the fierce temper and multiple red flags. The power mismatch in this ""relationship"" is about like that between me and my cat.

Get your family to Western Union you a couple of thousand bucks to get back to the US. Escape."
851,"This is a good point.  After I was practicing for a few years, I took my then-current boyfriend (who is also a lawyer, BTW) to a shindig that my BIGLAW firm put on for our clients.  He proceeded to get roaring drunk at the open bar and got into verbal altercations with various people to the extent that I was asked to take him home.  No idea if that affected my career path, but it was humiliating.

My current mantra (and apologize if this comes across as sexist, I'm a woman) is that I expect my partners to be OK with ""being the wife"" (my shorthand way of explaining it) at professional social events.  That is, if my partner has an event, I will show up and make small talk, focusing on being charming and gracious so that my presence reflects well on my partner.  I expect the same when I bring my partner to a professional social event.  He needs to understand that his presence at the event isn't about him, it's about me and he needs to comport himself in a manner that reflects well on me.  Boyfriends that couldn't or wouldn't do that didn't last long."
852,"I think that for someone who has made some profoundly bad decisions in his own life, your bf is correct about his wishes regarding ending your relationship.

He is trying to do what's best for you which is to leave him and create a life without him in it.

I'm not suggesting that you should lose your feelings for him - we feel what we feel, but you do need to work on your future without him."
853,"I think it’s more awkward to tell her to her face. In the event she actually had romantic intentions for the coffee meet up, it would likely be more embarrassing to clarify that in person! Best to clarify beforehand that it’s a platonic meet up. Plus it is respecting your relationship to do so."
854,"Regardless of how yourcdad is trying to spin this, there's absolutely no reason for him to be calling your friends asking anything at all about your wife.   Nobody is painting him as a bad guy.  Just a guy who called his daughter in laws best friend to ask intrusive questions that he shouldn't have.    He needs to learn boundaries.  "
