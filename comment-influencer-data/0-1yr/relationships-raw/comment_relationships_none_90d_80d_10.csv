0,"the things he could do to destroy a little  kid's confidence are terrifying.

   Imagine being a little girl headed to puberty and hearing Daddy talk about Mommy like this.

 Please, flee."
1,I stepped into a puddle this morning taking out the trash that was somehow less disgusting and less shallow than your partner.
2,"Oh god I didn't even think of that. Not just talking about mommy like this, but also ""Are you really going to eat that ice cream?"" is exactly how kids develop lifelong eating disorders."
3,"It sounds to me like his friends are the ones feeling judged. That kind of hard-partying drug lifestyle really isn't cute when you're in your late 20s and not a rockstar, and they probably realize that. It's easier to paint you as controlling and judgmental than it is to admit your boyfriend is taking the grown-up path and they're not.

Is he standing up for you? If he's still associating with these people at all he needs to make it very clear that these are his choices and talking poorly about you is unacceptable."
4,"Sounds to me like after all the abuse your mother has been putting you through your whole life, you've ended up with a partner who treats you the same way. You should break up with him and dig into this with your therapist. You deserve to live free of abuse. And trust me, what he is doing is 100% abusive."
5,In this world just having job you don't hate is a win. I don't have my dream job but great work/life balance
6,"&gt; Welp Mark would not shut up about how he could not understand why the physiologist would be with his wife.

Because the psychologist actually has a healthy worldview and actually looks at other things besides his wife's weight? Because they have a healthy relationship which is based on respect for each other? Because it's possible for two people to be together for reasons other than purely physical?

&gt; I told Mark that maybe we should break up than because I know its not realistic to be in the best shape all the time. He thinks I'm being emotional and dramatic

Wait, what? *What the fuck?* He was the one who said he'd divorce you if you put on weight, who's being dramatic here? Not you. If anything yours is the rational response, thinking it's better to bail than set up for massive hurt later. Talking hypothetical divorce over stupid shit is a great way to draw out every insecurity which doesn't even exist, it's a great way to throw a ticking time bomb into any relationship.

But divorce, *that's not the part you should focus on*. It's only another symptom of the whole. He's just another zealot. There is no being reasonable with the unreasonable, there's no common ground to find with people who give no ground."
7,"It's not your job to help her. And her mother is failing at her job which is to get her daughter the help she needs.

As other people stated, you need to get the police involved with the harassment issue."
8,Sometimes the most difficult thing to do is cut ties especially when the other person is not being fully open with their intentions .
9,"Is he this petty about everything else you two do?  

Does he add up the costs of each meal he buys vs you buy and tell you to make it up when you're paying?   
Does he tally chores you each do to make sure the time spent is exactly equal?   
Does he expect you both to work the exact same amount of hours for it to be fair?  

Like if he doesn't like driving that's one thing, but it seems like he's just being a petty asshole at this point."
10,"It’s very considerate of you to try to change your behavior by learning to be more patient, but this problem really seems to be on her, and she needs to stop. You said you’ve talked about it and she is aware that she does it, so maybe instead of letting it continue until you snap, you could make a plan with her that you will point it out to her as soon as she does it- the first comment, not the fifth/sixth/etc. Maybe you could decide together what phrase you’ll use to point out the behavior to her, that way it’s something she finds acceptable and not rude. Maybe saying something like, “That comment seemed directed toward the traffic conditions. I am aware and am paying attention, so please don’t say any more.” Eventually the phrase could be shortened to just a word that would bring it to her attention when she starts doing it."
11,"&gt;he just wants me to be the best me for ""both of us"" which I think is bullshit

​You're right; it is bullshit. 

His priority is having a trophy wife, not a happy partner, and if I were you I'd be kicking his selfish, shallow arse to the kerb."
12,You didn't hurt him so much as he had to adapt his narrative to reality. He thought that he had a new fan and didn't. That's understandably disappointing and that disappointment is what you likely saw on his face.  but on the other hand he has a friend who loves him and his music and is super supportive so that is awesome. That probably makes him happy a lot more often than this moment of disappointment. Long term he's better off with this reality than the one he thought he had. You're a great friend!
13,"You don't need to be more patient, she needs to stop. Jesus that was infuriating to just read, can't imagine having to put up with it."
14,"I am so sorry that this is happening. Do you have a support system that you can reach out to? You’re still gonna need help with the baby. Please pursue your husband for child support since he still needs to help with the child he created.

I was going to say it sounds like it could be PPD, but you said that he wws going to leave the country. I am so sorry. I would advise you that you not take him back after this."
15,"Police boi, dis is harassment"
16,"&gt; I have brought this up to her MANY times over the years, but she just doesn’t see it. 

*Of course* she ""doesn't see it"" when seeing it would mean she'd have to do so much more for herself and even do favors for you."
17,Why wait until you’re pregnant? Divorce him now and save yourself years of trouble.
18,"Nope do not send this. You don't owe her an explanation. This is absolutely none of her business and by giving her a long winded explanation, you are validating her. And you are also giving her the satisfaction of being annoyed.

Ignore this completely. It is hard to do but this will get on her nerves the most. She won't know whether you are annoyed or don't care and she'll keep waiting for an answer and she will be frustrated when her remark falls flat. Can you do this?

If you absolutely have to reply. Say something vague like ""thanks"". No emotion nothing. That would also be smartly annoying"
19,"It's like frozen pizza. You don't want frozen pizza, you want fresh delivered pizza..... but, if you find yourself hung over and in need, the frozen pizza will do. You're her frozen pizza, kept on ice until a time of dire need."
20,"* It covers your bills

* The industry will exist 10 years from now

* You don’t want to commit suicide from the stress

* You can improve your standing by getting better and/or experience in the field

If you’ve got all four, you’re probably ahead of 99 percent of living humans. The idea that a job should be a passion is such a luxury."
21,"Nickel and dime-ing you, not in money, but in ""free labour."" The worst."
22,She wants to know you'll still be around if she ever wants you again. She's keeping you on the hook.
23,"""Mom, I have to live in this community. Yours and dads behavior this weekend was extremely embarrassing. I'm not comfortable with my neighbors associating this incident with me. I hate to say this, but I would rather you not come to the beach for a while."""
24,"He needs help. It’s not an option. He clearly isn’t processing what happened in a healthy way.

He’s super young and witnessed something that almost everyone will never have to witness. I suggest he go to some form of counseling to work through what happened because it’s taking a toll on his existence."
25,I think you nailed it.  They're freaking out because the party crowd gets thinner every year as most people mature into adulthood.  When you're pushing 30 every party friend is precious as gold.
26,"&gt; Is it okay to just work to live instead of living to work?

Yes.

You also might change your mind at some point, and that's also okay.

My wife didn't figure out her dream job until she was 30, and she was *utterly miserable* in her old job. If you're not even unhappy? You're fine."
27,"She told me! Rather cruelly, but yes. I think she’s quite unhappy. I bear her no ill will, because he’s doubtless done quite a number on her too. She did know we were together the whole time, though, but he lied lots to both of us. He won’t break up with her because he doesn’t want any to go from 2 girlfriends to 0 (who would!) 

But I don’t think they’ll be quite as happy in the long-term. He is not, fundamentally, at peace with himself. I doubt that she is, either."
28,"So you two have already identified this as a potential issue and begun talking about it, and that's good! You said the ideal compromise that you two have identified (separate rooms for each of your own needs &amp; tastes) is not in your price range.

So what *is* in your price range? Sit down together and look at the places you would be able to afford together and count the bedrooms/rooms. Talk through how you would adjust your ideal compromise (a room for her hobbies, a workspace for you, a guest room, a bedroom for you two, a studio, a traditional living room, a non-traditional hangout space, a plant room, etc) to fit your actual living space. Clearly you both can't have everything, so if you can hypothetically afford a 2-bedroom home with a living room and a dining room, you could each have a bedroom to decorate as you see fit and then plan *together* how to set up the common rooms.

If you still can't reach a compromise it might be time to have the conversation about whether you two can actually be compatible with one another."
29,"You have a well paid job that you're good at and can maintain a good work life balance with? Holy shit that sounds like a dream job to me.

It's nice for him that he gets to work his dream but it sounds like he's stuck on defining people by their job and not their personhood."
30,"I would just be blunt about it. Tell her you saw a fingerprint label in your phone under her name that you didn’t add, and ask if she added herself.

Also, if she did really do that among other problems you say you’ve been having, you should look into finding other housing if possible"
31,"As the child of parents who occasionally made comments like that, I concur. Unlearning all that in that in therapy ain't fun...run while you can, OP!"
32,"Her message to you is from a life of being manipulated by your mother.

There are so many stories of siblings hating each other because of how the parents played them off against each other.

Just keep the dialogue open with your dad if you still want to. Don't worry about your mother or sisters at this point as nothing to do can change them for the better.

Tell your dad you are happy to have a relationship with him if he wishes, but the contact with the rest of the family is a bit harder for you right now as you've been shown and told that you're not welcome. Be honest with him."
33,"I think you know the answer here- you're not out of line, you're working a totally appropriate job and the way you dress is nobody's business but yours.  He's searching for reasons that seem legit but there aren't any- it's really that he just wants the control over you and he's losing it. I'd bet he tries to come back... please don't let him. He's a deadbeat and you can do better."
34,"If I were you, I'd put this letter to one side for a couple of weeks and see if you still feel like sending it after that. 

I think you need to weigh up the balance between the impact this will have on your father, which could be negligible, and the impact it might have on you - and whether or not that is worth it for you emotionally and practically.  

For example, is potentially being cut out of inheritance worth it? Is potentially being isolated from the other family you have reconnected with worth it? 

If your father is an uncaring person who only really thinks about himself and not about you - any letter you send him might just go over his head and be a total waste of time anyway. 

I understand that you perhaps feel the need to formally end the relationship again - but as he appears to have made little effort to stay in touch with you over the past seven years, he may not even try to keep the relationship going anyway. It might be easier to just ghost him. 

Also, at the back of my mind, I do wonder if his wonderful financial status is a bit fake? He sounds like a show off and a boaster, and I'm always suspicious of people who feel the need to boast about how much money they have. I knew a man once who was not a good father and had children by two different women, basically walked away from one family and into his next one. He appeared to provide a really comfortable life for his children, was very vocal about this - but one day it all came crashing down. Turned out he was significantly in debt and it was pretty much all lies.

Basically all I'm saying is put yourself first here, and don't pour your heart out to someone who isn't going to care to truly listen."
35,"&gt; All of a sudden, seemingly out of the blue

I am not trying to be too hard on you OP, but do you honestly think it's totally out of the blue? She's clearly reacting to an extremely traumatic event and is potentially going through some PTSD. She needs a grief/family/marriage/personal counselor to work through this."
36,"This is a really tough one. I would make sure to encourage and validate your sister right now. Remind her that she deserves better than her current treatment and lifestyle. Is there anyway you could take some work off her plate, like go over to help her make meals from time to time, invite them over for dinner, or baby-sit the children? Or even just give her excuses to get out of the house, like think up some kind of mild emergency that you need your sister's help for? 

I think a couples counselor who is familiar with the cultural dynamics going on here would also be a good idea for your sister and her husband. I don't know the best way to go about finding or recommending that, though. It would have to be done very tactfully and diplomatically. 

Why on earth is she cooking meals for her sister-in-law's family? Does the sister-in-law ever return the favor? It is mind-boggling to me that all of her in-laws are just in on this and letting it happen. If your sister's husband doesn't step up, I see resentment and burn out in their future. He's doing everyone involved here a huge disservice."
37,"""Hey, I've noticed Darrick made some weird purchases at [X] on [X].  Maybe he got his identity stolen?"" *Emails receipt*."
38,"Your entire post reads like, *""I am desperate for an emotional connection and I have fixated on this one guy that I think I have an emotional connection with.""* Sorry to be so brutally honest, but I am assuming you did not come here to be coddled. 

You have never really connected with anyone. Not with your family, not with friends and, to be honest, not with your bf. It sounds like your relationship arose out of a need and not out of love. I cannot comment on his part, but from what you have described so far, on your part, it sounds like it arose out of a need to be loved or to connect with someone.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to be loved. We all want to be loved, but, from your post, you seem to think that love should come from the outside of you. You seem to believe that he is the only one who can ever or has ever loved you. You are looking to him to give you your sense of purpose, value and direction, things that you should be providing for yourself. You have put yourself at his mercy. Now he is the one who will determine if you will be happy. He is so responsible for your happiness that you hate yourself with a burning passion that you want to die.

You are probably wondering how I can have the audacity to make such bold statements when I know nothing about you, but in truth, you sound a lot like me when I was your age and in a the position that you are in. The only difference is that I had no one to tell me all these and I had to learn the brutally hard way through painful life's lessons, loss of friends, loss of time, loss of peace, loss of joy and loss of happiness before coming to the conclusion that I, and I alone was responsible for making myself happy and that I, and I alone can provide myself with a sense of purpose meaning and direction.

I grew up with an abusive father, a jealous stepmother and a mother who emotionally abandoned me. I felt very much love starved and very desperate for a connection. I found it very hard to trust others and had few friends and always imagined that my friends thought the worst of me (they didn't, it was me who hated myself and simply imagined that they, too, hated me when nothing could be further from the truth.) I had a very hard shell that anyone who wanted to know me had to crack to get to it, but once the shell came down, I was clingy because the love starved me eventually came out and would have done anything to make a relationship work, even an unhealthy one. Oh, and I had a very hard time differentiating between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship. While you have not gone into too much detail, it does not sound like your relationship is very healthy and nor does it sound like you have compatible goals.

It really sounds like you are all over the place. It sounds like you have given your ex, from your statement, complete and absolute power over you through your belief that he is the only one who has ever cared about you, when in truth, it does not sound like you care about yourself. It does not sound like you love yourself. It sounds like you are looking for someone to love you so that you can feel like you are worth loving, so that, in turn, you can love yourself. It does not work that way. It never has and it never will.

That is another problem in getting into a relationship when you have feelings of unworthiness and lack of self love, you never know if you are fighting for a relationship out of love or out of a need to be loved. There is a world of difference between love and need to be loved. In one, you are comfortable with yourself. Yes, it hurts when a relationship ends, but the relationship is not your be all and end all. You are already complete on your own. In the other, when the relationship breaks, you break. When the relationship ends, you feel like you are coming undone. A large part of yourself is defined by your relationship and your need to be loved.

My advice is something you may not have considered, step back from romantic relationships for a while. Put your goals for marriage and a family on ice for a while. Take time to be with yourself, know yourself and come to terms with who you are. Take time to be in a position where you define yourself so wholly and so completely that you are comfortably able to walk out of situations and relationships that are unhealthy for you without coming undone and feeling like you want to die.

I will make another bold statement and say that you do not love yourself and the reason that you do not love yourself is because you do not know yourself. So, take time to know yourself."
39,"The other comments so far are being way too lenient. 

He left at 6AM. He's definitely away from his wife, apparently in another city? since you mentioned the airport. He's not due back for another 3 days at least, and yet the first day he was gone, possibly within just a few hours of landing, he immediately goes out and buys lube and condoms.

Please. He didn't buy this shit to take it back to his wife. He's not even remotely innocent here.

His diagnosis doesn't just absolve him. His diagnosis doesn't mean that his wife wouldn't be extremely hurt by this, especially since it was almost definitely planned before he even left, whether he had someone waiting at his destination or he planned to find someone that night.

OP, you should bypass him entirely and go tell his wife. I understand your concerns about him going into a psychosis again, but you either tell her or you just ignore it. Going to him is pointless. It wouldn't fix anything and could throw him into the psychosis anyways (I assume?) But if you tell his wife, at least she can decide for yourself. And you have proof."
40,"The fact that he told you he would book things and then didn't because he thinks he has the power to forbid you from going should be a red flag to you. All his comments about ""just asking for it"" etc should send you running. Book your vacation and dump this fool."
41,"This happened to a really good friend of mine. He broke up with his girlfriend who had a really bad history of bipolar disorder. She stopped taking her meds, threatened to kill herself, and would text him upwards of 60+ times a day. If you live in the US You can take legal action. This is the basis for a restraining order or at least a warning from the police. You don’t deserve to be harassed like this. But it’s important to remember that this is her behavior that she needs to correct and it is not your job to correct it for her and it is not your fault she is acting this way."
42,"My grandparents used ""frying pan"" after watching a CSI episode where the wife killed her nagging husband with a frying pan."
43,"""How is that funny?'

Every time. Every single time. Make her explain herself."
44,"&gt; It eventually starts to annoy them as they feel like I'm not spending enough time with them.

This is the part that doesn't make sense. If you'd rather  hang out in a coffee shop than your house, that shouldn't be a big deal. But if you're turning down invitations from friends or dating partners to hang out in a coffee shop for the fifth day this week, that's strange. And it doesn't make sense when you say you go to the coffee shop because you have nobody to do things with."
45,"Have you told his ""ex"" as well? She should know if she doesn't already."
46,"If your girlfriend assures you that gifts are not expected in return then you are off the hook. Your family should just give whatever they normally would, if anything."
47,"Maybe your boyfriend installed a key logger on your computer. Time to take it to a repair shop and have it cleaned. 

Also, lose the boyfriend; he sounds creepy as hell."
48,"&gt; we had a particularly nasty argument which proceeded in him threatening to kill me and one of my neighbours phoning the police.


He threatened to kill you. You said yourself that you could never leave your children, so why give him the chance to remove you from their lives? You're in a though and complex situation that is no doubt causing a lot of pain for you and your children, but I'm a firm believer in setting firm boundaries with those who make threats to murder me. If he returns, please don't assume all is well and back to normal. Believe his threats to kill you and never be alone with him or allow him to be alone with your kids. Contact a lawyer. You say you have mental health issues, but you don't deserve to be killed for them. 


Reach out for support from family/friends/neighbors and reassure your daughter that she did nothing wrong and that it is her father that is the one who is wrong. Seek therapy if you can. I'm sorry you're dealing with all of this."
49,"&gt;I think the big conflict is that she doesn't see why things should be used as intended. She's the sort to ask ""why can't the roof be a lounging spot?"" ""Why can't the living room be for hobbies too"" because **she isn't so bothered by the impracticality of all that.**

&gt;And **I don't think she really shares the want for a homey space to entertain people that I do, or really gets it for that matter.**


So this is a value difference right here, and it's the test of a relationship to see if you can *actually understand what the other person wants.* That understanding can lead to a world of difference and makes compromising much, much easier on both sides.

It's not good enough at this point for her to ""not really get"" why you like to decorate the way that you do and why it's important to you. And the same goes for you: she should feel that you have a full understanding of her own tastes *even if you don't agree with them at ALL.*

It's so much easier to let go of the feeling of ""ew I don't want a bean bag chair in the living room because I'm 30"" feeling when you understand that this is what makes her feel happy or that she needs her home environment to emphasize comfort over function or whatever. It doesn't make the bean bag chair any less ugly to you, but it might help you tolerate it.

Similarly, if she understands that you feel most relaxed and comfortable in a sparse, simple home environment or that you value functionality because it reduces stress/anxiety or whatever, that would help her understand that this is important to you in the same way that her decorating preferences are important to her.

Talk to her again and have an honest conversation about what you both value *and WHY* you value those things in a home. Seek to understand the other's perspective, not to ""win"" or ""convince"" the other to do it your way.

If you two can't do that or you do it and still can't compromise, that's a pretty big sign that you're not compatible IMHO."
50,"Yep, I agree. “I make a lot of jokes when I’m drunk” translates to “crap, I hope my come-ons didn’t ruin our friendship.”"
51,"&gt; He was the one who said he'd divorce you if you put on weight, who's being dramatic here? Not you. If anything yours is the rational response, thinking it's better to bail than set up for massive hurt later. 

Yes. Mark has just given an ultimatum: don't gain weight or I'll leave you. You know, rationally, that people maintain some weight after pregnancy, and it's hard to know how hard it'll be to lose that weight. So rather than put up with an unrealistic expectation, you're countering his own ultimatum. That's pretty sound logic, and if it's emotional or dramatic, it's because he raised the stakes by making his ultimatum in the first place."
52,"I’m wracking my brain for a successful business owner who only succeeded because he moved his single, female, coworker, into his house.....hmmm.. yeah! I got nothing! Why? Because this is the biggest bunch of bullshit I’ve ever heard.

“Hey honey, I’m gonna move in this coworker I’m banging, so I don’t have to walk more then 500 feet to bang her, eat my cereal in my PJs oh and maybe get some work done. You’re good with that, right baby?”"
53,"There's nothing to worry about here.  Sometimes one's exes feel entitled to stay in the ""inner circle"" of life stuff and are upset to find out that they aren't.  It's presumptuous but it poses no threat to your relationship and doesn't need to affect you at all.

The feelings that your boyfriend affirmed, that he still respects and cares about her, are not a problem.  That's what a good person feels about people who have been important to him in the past.  The ""scorched earth"" policy of erasing all feeling for exes and cutting them off completely is way weirder and more troubling (outside of certain contexts, like abuse).

I mean, I can't say whether or not your relationship is solid, but none of the stuff you've said here should cause you concern."
54,"She has to chose between you and her family. 

her family has forced the issue, and your gf needs to make up her mind about what she wants. 

Under no circumstances should you convert to appease her family, and if your gf thinks you should, it's time to drop her and move on."
55,I think your dad is having some mental health issues. Is it possible he has early dementia?
56,I think you should tell your boyfriend and how uncomfortable it’s making you
57,"Sue his ass for child support asap. Even if he doesn't want the child anymore, he already let this happen and should take responsibility to at least provide for it. I wonder if that's why he's running from the country."
58,Could he be leaving the country in an effort to avoid paying child support and/or alimony?
59,Simple answer - tell her no.
60,"I'm going to be callous but fuck her depression. Your foster sister may be potentially in for severe psychosis, depression, anxiety, drug use, and suicide if this guy progresses. Sexual abuse victims don't just get fucked once, they're fucked for the rest of their life. Don't let her be one, y'all are her protectors at this age."
61,"Sounds like she wants to have her cake and eat it, which she can't.  She made her choice, now needs to let you go."
62,What a scumbag. I’m so sorry.
63,"&gt;the only friend i ever have at a time is the person im dating.

Work on that."
64,"Let him take the kids over to his parents' place on his own once or twice, and I bet he stops being so enthusiastic.

For Mother's Day next year, tell him that what you want is to stay home and celebrate with your children, and then insist on it. Other holidays, you just have to start pushing back."
65,This kinda shit will never end. One year it's this driving and then the next year it's some other bullshit you owe him. You don't owe him anything. You helped out more while he had to take one for the team but that's over now. You're not this mother so you don't have to wash his dishes. Split the work and driving. If he won't then run. Imagine having kids and him making you bare all the work load over and over again. Nah.
66,"This is insane. Do not agree to continue this “arrangement” a single minute longer. You aren’t his long-distance chauffeur just because he had a longer work commute for awhile. If he doesn’t understand that, there’s a serious problem with respect here."

68,"I'm in a wheelchair myself, (I'm 27F) and my advice to you is this:

Unless you think there's a chance that she could one day bear and successfully parent a child, have the surgery. Puberty takes a huge toll on people with disabilities, especially women. Before I got on birth control I had stage IV endometriosis and had to miss school for several days whenever I'd get my period."
69,Honestly I have no thoughts but her balcony jungle sounds amazing
70,"I used as safe word like that with an issue in a prior relationship and it was great. 

We lived together and split cooking and whenever I'd cook he would stand over me like a hawk and give ""helpful comments"" and it drove me crazy. Did your usual arguing, calmly explaining, whatever, but he used to be a professional cook and even though he trusted my ability to cook, it made him kinda anxious plus he thought he truly was being helpful. 

Eventually we came to the conclusion that when the comments become a problem, I'd ask him to ""go check the mail"" and that was his hint to STFU and GTFO. It's like condensing your repetitive argument into a single sentence. ""Hey cool yes I'll definitely peel the cucumber uhh btw have you checked the mail today? You should go check the mail. Bet there's something fun and interesting in the mail today."""
71,"His weird behavior seems to be focused on your foster sister, so one would think that it's your parents you need to talk to about this. Have you mentioned this to them, and if so what did they say?"

73,"Life Lesson #890:

His feelings should not be more important than your sense of safety or sanity or boundaries."

""We can't offer you a place here. You'll need to work something else out.""

Don't give her any reasonings or excuses or anything else she can latch into to try to tear apart, just drive every statement flat into the ground."
76,"Just my two cents from someone who is way older but has been with both type of guys. My first boyfriend was weight obsessed. I was literally a size 0, couldn't eat in front of him and barely ate at all. He dumped me for a even younger girl which was a blessing in disguise. I am now married to my college boyfriend going on 27 years - we've had two kids and I am heavy at 51. Guess what? He still chases me around the house. Your b\\f needs to love you for you and all the different packages you will come in over the years - he is telling you he won't - believe him and find someone who will chase you around the house at 50."
77,"This kind of situation is so common that it would be comical if it wasn't tragic. People always end up being hostages of their need to show others how reasonable they are to others, without realizing that other people often use this against them.

As long as a person doesn't ""recognize"" the problem, they don't ""need"" to do anything about it. Obviously this isn't true: a good partner would try to make an effort to understand the other, and even if they don't understand, they would still try to take any action to solve something that is causing problems in the relationship itself. 

But manipulative people know that many people feel the need to be seen as reasonable and prudent. They explore this need to control other people's behaviour. Do you have a perfectly sensible and reasonable proposition when you asked something? Too bad, it's simple, I pretend that I don't understand and that I don't see a problem. Then you will never be able to ask me to do it because you will feel the need to ""make me understand"" your side. And we always go back to step one.

So I'm just going to always say that I don't understand / don't see / it's not a problem. So you're going to keep trying to explain, and I will keep doing things and maintaining the status quo, and you're not going to do anything about it! Great, huh? Yeah, ""great"" for them, as long as you allow the person to do that to you."
78,"""How can I solve my lack of boundaries by actually appreciating when they get trampled on?"" - - far too many posts in this sub

If you can't establish a boundary and have it respected, there's something fundamentally unhealthy in that relationship."
79,"Tell her thats not good enough. She needs to STOP ENTIRELY. Periodt. Because its distracting and makes you feel like she thinks you don't know what you're doing, which is causing resentment to build up.

\&gt;She also said that she's not just going to be entirely quiet in the car.

&amp;#x200B;

What? If she's not barking out orders she has to be totally silent? Can't she just talk about, oh I don't know, one of the billions of other topics that exist in this world? Like superheroes or the latest movie she saw on netflix?"
80,He should at least work part time in the interim so you’re not going to be broke in two years if it doesn’t work out.
81,"If she leaves you because of this, you are better off"
82,I'm skeptical of any relationship where the couple keeps score.
83,Wow. This is so beyond fucked up. This is way above Reddit’s pay grade. See a therapist as soon as possible because you’re going to need to unpack this. I can only tell you this: what your father has done will completely fuck up any chance to you’ll grieve and remember him as the loving dad you knew and it will fuck you up for a long time. I don’t understand people who will burn down their entire lives over an asshole stranger.
84,"I mean...there are many roads you could take, some better than others.

You sound like a sweet guy who doesn’t want to have a big confrontation with your parents.... in that case; I would be inclined to just lie. 

“Mom &amp; Dad, a neighbour reported you for drinking and causing a scene by disturbing other homeowners and defiling the grass. They linked your car back to my apartment and the HOA have let me know that you’re not welcome back to the beach and will take further action against me if they see you there again or if I have guests at the beach unsupervised again, sorry this happened maybe you can check out some other beaches but please be careful drinking in the water, you could get hurt! Love bye”"

86,It took 10 years for that attitude to drive you up a wall? Your options are pretty much counseling or divorce.
87,"&gt; She remembers. She's just blaming the alcohol because you didn't reciprocate.

I mean. From personal experience, you can 100% have a night where you are coherent(ish) and blackout entirely. Often waking up with a nagging feeling of ""did something happen"" because it's always a possibility when you literally have no idea what happened. Not saying it might not be a cover up, but that the opposite *is* possible."
88,"As someone who has been the ""backseat driver"" (though to a lesser degree than you describe here), I believe this is a problem that your girlfriend needs to change by changing her behavior.   
Have a talk with her when you are not in the car - tell her that her constant commenting on the traffic and your driving is not helping, but seriously distracting. Ask to try going a full week without any driving-related talk in the car to help her break the habit.  

Or let her drive for a week, while *you* offer a constant stream of ""helpful"" commentary.  

And show her this thread at some point."
89,"Well, if you plan on having kids, you better do it with someone else.  Losing it after pregnancy is one thing, but being pregnant, looking pregnant, and gaining during pregnancy are others things altogether.  It doesn’t sound like he’d deal well at all."
90,"&gt; I said I'm sorry for snapping, and asked her to please wait two seconds when she has helpful ""advice"" for me on the road before actually giving me the advice so that I actually have time to react before hearing her advice - but it keeps happening.

You're leaving out the critical part here. When you asked her this, what did she say? Did she agree to your reasonable request to stop doing this, and then keep doing it anyway, or did she refuse?"
91,"If he’s truly never done anything remotely like this, he should go see a doctor ASAP. I’ve heard similar stories where it turned out the individual acting erratically or out of character had a brain tumor. Additionally, go see a couple’s therapist. Good luck."

94,I had a neighbor who did this while I attended uni. Document all the police visits and then file harrasment with your PD. This was the advice from the vary cops who kept having to come out and it worked.
95,"I dont have advice about the marriage but I was a 5 year old girl who's father one day walked out and never came back. You need to sit her down and talk to her like an adult here. It's extremely terrifying and I guarantee theres some trauma here. My father was also explosive and angry like your husband was. Children see that and it effects them. You need to cut your daughter off from contacting him because this isnt helping. She can talk to him when he comes back and theres some sort of arrangement, but trying to reach a parent who doesnt want to be contacted as a young child is absolutely devastating. I'm 30 and still dealing with the day my father left for good.

Get your kid in therapy. And you while you're at it. Everyone's feelings right now are valid but you should not have to do this alone."
96,"This kind of abuse has been normalized to you. Definitely only something a therapist can help you with. Seriously, leave this man asap."
97,I think it's a very classy letter. It doesnt feel like it's trying to be punishing where he may just become angry and disregard it. It seems well thought out and balanced. I have no edits to suggest. Best of luck going forward and I'm sorry that seeing him was not the experience you were looking for.
98,"Who the fuck complains about ""shorts above the knee"" in 2019? 

And there are more kinds of abuse than physical. If he's like this a lot of the time (with this subject and/or others) it's emotional abuse."
99,"You're not out of line one bit, in fact you sound very normal and your ex sounds like a lazy control freak.  You're off trying to earn money to keep a roof over your head and he prefers going to BBQs; and he's not applying for jobs either.  Borrowing money isn't a solution - debt never is - and it just creates a long term issue.  In addition the ex makes decisions without asking you, criticises your clothing choices, and wants you to not drive because he says so.  Classic control creamery and you're better off without him.  He won't change, and he'll drag you down with him if you let him.  Move him off any agreements, get your own place, and find someone who respects you and your work ethic."
100,"""I give the silent treatment and mention I'm leaving him and he gets all upset, he loves me, he doesn't know what he would do without me"" of course not, who else allows him to abuse them like this? Break the pattern of accepting abusive behavior, this relationship is toxic."
101,"&gt; ""and just asking for it.""

On top of everything else...asking for *what*? This is dangerously close to suggesting that women are responsible for being sexually assaulted, which is a whole other level of gross on top of being controlling. Either he thinks you are going to cheat and therefore doesn't trust you enough to be dating you, or he thinks that on some level women who are attacked/assaulted while traveling alone are asking for it. Neither is a good possibility.

I would hit that ""book"" button and also the ""block"" button because boy bye."
102,"Your girlfriend is jealous and abusive. What is more: Her abusive behavior is causing you to be abusive too.

I don't think this is a healthy relationship. Proceed at your own peril."
103,"You're twisting yourself to fit into his life. You're working on an advanced degree, you're motivated, you've got direction. Where is the appeal of someone who's addicted to playing video games, doesn't work, or have any ambition? Seriously, where's the appeal? 

He was happy to let you and his mom pay his freight, but when you mention it to him, you're ""throwing it in his face""? You always had to plan activities and visits, why are you trying to shrink yourself down to fit into his sad world?

The best thing that can come out of this, OP is that he hates you. That way you'll never be tempted to get back together. Move on with your life. Someday, he may get his act together, but you don't have to put up with the fall out while he does it."
104,"You meet her and her family and realize the culture the family believes in, is the men cater to the women.  She continues being selfish 

You thought this behavior was cute and endearing.  She continues being selfish 

You begin to realize this treatment isn’t a two way street and hope for change.  She continues being selfish 

You begin to lash out, becoming resentful.  She continues being selfish 

She fully understands you her husband is unhappy. She continues being selfish 

Why are you not getting the picture?"
105,"The direct way is the only way. ""No, Mom, we can't take you in."" No apology, no explanations or justifications. Just keep saying no if she keeps asking.

You have no obligation to house her and your post makes it really clear that it would be a bad situation for you. Your mother needs to find other arrangements."
106,"&gt;If she’s SO on cloud nine about finishing that you don’t want to burst her bubble, I don’t think it’s disingenuous to wait until the next day. (And if she asks why you waited, you can just tell her that.)

This is great advice but i want to add something. He should absolutely NOT have sexual contact with her that night. Make up whatever reason. But it'd be shitty if he had sex with her that night and then breaks up with her in the morning."
107,"Has there been any sort of escalation over the course of your reationship? Has he ever shown a temper at all, raising his voice, instigating fights, or being 'moody' for no discernable reason? Has he ever tried to control where you're going, who you're seeing, or what you're wearing? Abusers rarely start oit abusive; they like to test their partners a little at a time, to see what they'll tolerate, and then letting you grow accustomed to that treatment before escalating again.

You know him best, and if this is truly out of the blue, if there have never been any warning signs or red flags, if you can look back on the entirety of your relationship and say with confidence and certainty that this is definitely a one-off, out-of-character incident, then I would proceed with caution.

You don't have to meet up with him in person if you don't want to. Frankly, if you're fearful, I wouldn't risk it. You could always meet somewhere in public if you feel you need to look him in the eyes. If you have a close friend you trust, you can ask them if they would be comfortable chaperoning. If you can think hard about this and determine if it's completely out of the blue and decide to hear what the hell is going on, call him and tell him you're willing to listen, but no reason he gives is going to be 'good enough'. This isn't something he can explain away. There is NO excuse. He needs to understand that there is absolutely nothing going on in his life to justify him lashing out at you like that. Tell him you'll listen to his explanation, but if he thinks it's going to drive you back into his arms, he's got another thing coming. Therapy and marriage counseling at the very LEAST, if he intends to truly show himself remorseful."
108,"You have the luxury of time. Start looking, but only leave for an ideal new situation."
109,"&gt; It's really hard for me to understand all of it and why a select few of his friends have so much opposition to this.

Because they see you as influencing your boyfriend's decision to stop doing drugs. If your boyfriend stops doing drugs and improves his life, then it proves that they have no excuse for not doing so.

This is why recovery from addiction usually involves breaking off friendships with people who are still using."
110,I want an update to this story.
111,"Lol loving the transparent attempt to spin this your way. Woe is you as you rock your child while your partner drinks in the garden, huh. 

Look these are significant f*** ups OP that she has to live with. And sorry but forgetting to pick up your kid “a few weeks ago” is very likely the actual final straw for her. And now, an appliance you rely on (she relies on), not delivered. Due to the same pattern of not caring enough to check. 

Look, the silent treatment isn’t ever ok. That’s clear and simple. But have you taken any action beyond “I’ll try harder” to be a reliable partner??"
112,"I live in a different city...while I wish I lived closer, moving isn't an option. 

The sister in law dinner thing is most likely bc her MIL insists. It's also a part of that antiquated idea that the daughter in law serves her husband's family. 

My parents live 5 mins away, but I think she resents my mom for encouraging the arranged marriage idea. If she can move on from that, I think she could say that she's going over the help my mom. I can talk to her about that. 

I think it's unlikely that she will ask for couple's counseling unless she's pushed to the brink, which will probably happen eventually."
113,I sincerely hope your brother's wife got the hell out of that relationship.
114,Just tell her that you read her tweet and that you'll be happy to cancel since she doesn't want it. You don't have to be offended at how she feels. She's allowed to not want it. You're allowed to not put in all that effort.

117,"&gt;But once Im at the shop and all settled in I wont really leave until my 10 hours are up.

Yeah, no. This is absolutely not normal or healthy. It seems you have some strange idea stuck in your head that once you're there, you need to be there for 10 h, and you also go through long walks to get there. This sounds like an obsessive habit you've created and is absolutely not something anyone will put up with.

Also, 3/4 drinks and a sandwich aren't going to cover you using their wifi and a table for 10 h. It IS kind of rude."
118,All you can do is own the truth and hope for the best. Mental health issues are not an excuse for cheating tho.
119,"&gt; There's no evidence for anything so maybe I'm overly paranoid? 

This is a classic example of a situation where you'll learn more from her reaction than you will from the ""evidence"". Just present the facts of what you found, in a clear and concise manner. If she simply discusses them with you and offers a calm rational response, then you're in the clear. If she blows up, starts pointing fingers, getting defensive, etc, you have bigger concerns."
120,"Internet hugs! You are not alone you have your partner and your friends. They are your family. Your sisters message just shows that you made the right choice to pull away and put yourself first. She's just too young, immature to understand this and most likely only have half the story. Just remember, you can always choose who you want to be part of your real family, blood or not."
121,Seems strange. Why would she label it with her own name?
122,"if her mother would exert the energy she now spends on harassing other people, instead into helping her daughter, everything would be a lot better

125,"Just leave her there. Consistently. She’ll either start putting herself to bed before passing out on the couch, or she’ll learn to set a phone alarm.

If it makes you feel better, for a few nights you can start by waking her ONCE and then leaving her there.

You’re not there to be her dad. Let her learn to take care of her damn self. She’ll figure it out eventually."
126,"Motivation does not need to be measured in terms of employment. 

Like, at all. 

You can be motivated in other areas of life like making strong connections with family, friends, and community, having hobbies, ect. Fuck, your motivation can be ""enjoyment of life"" and that's 100% ok too. 

He does not get to call you unmotivated because your motivation doesn't look the same as his."
127,"Yes, I can do that. She also mentioned being out with her family for Father's Day and so I could just ignore everything else and say, ""Have fun celebrating! :)"""
128,"I think...that it's easy to throw out ""well we're perfect except for this huge thing that makes everything not perfect that wont ever be changing."" I think you know you're straight, and that's okay! You do not have to force attraction that isn't there. You want to date a woman. Right now, you're not dating a woman. If your partner wants to bind their breasts and do other things to register as more androgynous, which they might one day, do you imagine that would affect your sexual attraction even more? Your partners decisions with their body can go a million new ways that you're just not going to be attracted to.

I think it's time to end the relationship while there are still happy feelings and love for each other. Riding this out until the wheels fall off wouldn't be healthy for either of you"
129,You missed the part where the girlfriend thought it was normal that he had to explain himself to the dad for listening to her vent.
130,"You can't move on if you dont... actually move on.  You can be friends in the future but it seems pretty manipulative for her to break up with you then ask you not to 'abandon her'.  Don't fall for it.  It's hard, but take some time for yourself.  You deserve it.  Meet some new people.  Try something new, something maybe you couldn't do when you were together."
131,"&gt;Will her family look down on me for being a convert? 

Yes. 

&gt;Will they treat G poorly because of it?

Yes. 

These people are looking to divide, and they don't care what means they use to do so. Even if you're now considered a Jew, you're never going to be the ""right"" kind of Jew to them."
132,This girl either is the most naive person I've ever read about or she just blatantly doesn't give a shit about your feelings. I would ask to attend too if nothing shady was going on it shouldn't be a problem and you want her to be safe. If she back pedals then it's pretty obvious it's a lost cause. It seems like you are more settled down and serious about the relationship than she is. You might want to cut her loose.

Your future together, the chance of beginning a family, of getting married etc that motivates him? But beyond that, I am appalled that he gaslighted you when you said you still weren't okay with the situation. So what, you're supposed to roll over and let him put this girl in front of you? That's some BS, and shows where his true intentions for you and the future of your relationship lie. 

Get out, find someone worthwhile. He's not."
136,"Say ""please don't do this because it stresses me out and it makes it more likely we will have an accident."""
137,"Because he's a massive manipulator, and you feel guilty, knowing you shouldn't, deep down. Fuck him. He knows what he is doing but he will never show you his true colors to your face. You're better off. Closure is a myth. Get used you resenting him forever. Been there, doing that."
138,"Someone said to me once, it’s better to be lonely alone than with someone. You and your daughter deserve to be a family— you want pictures and people around her who love her. With that sack of crap, you were able to even take pictures! He didn’t tell anyone you were pregnant— that tells me he didn’t even try to pretend and hope his heart would go along! Focus on her and getting deadbeat to pay the money. But it’s better having him gone than there, better having him honest than having her heart broken that she keeps expecting him to love her but failing or think that it’s her, better than having to negotiate coparenting with someone awful or having someone use the kid to hurt you. You deserve to enjoy your baby and I don’t see how you could do that with him around."
139,"I feel like you're so used to being stressed out that when you don't have anything to worry about that's right in front of you (since you aren't working and are mostly homebound right now), you have to create a new problem.  Has your husband expressed resentment towards you?  If he did, I feel like you would have mentioned it.  Your job is to get mentally healthy while your doctors and husband work to get you physically healthy.  You aren't doing your job if you're spending your time in dread of a problem that doesn't actually exist.  If you *can't* do your job, meaning the thoughts are intrusive and your coping skills are useless in the face of your anxiety, then it's time to start treating it like a physical brain problem and talking to your doctor.  You are probably a good candidate for anti-anxiety medicine, if you aren't taking it already.

It sounds like you are literally dying of worry.  I don't know your situation or history because all I have is this post to go on, but you should be treating your anxiety as a symptom as equally dangerous to you as your occasional physical paralysis."
140,"Whether or not you confront her, make sure you reset your passcode because she had to know that if she put her fingerprint in. Just to be safe, I might reset other passwords too.

142,"Are they horrible to you? You don't mention it, but if they are abusive horrible people of course you can't stand them and are glad to get away.

If they are just normal annoying parents, this will probably pass, especially after you go away to college. 

I remember one day I came home from work and my 18 year old was sitting in the living room. I sat down on the couch and asked her what she wanted for dinner and the next 20  minutes was list of all the ways she hated me, all my failings as a person, mother, cook, the clothes I wore, my hair style, my makeup, I apparently had bad breath. And no on liked me. It was like a hurricane of hatred.

All I could think of to do was go cook dinner and act like it never happened. Thankfully I had friends to talk to who explained that this was called ""soiling the nest"" and a fairly common thing."
143,"Off topic but she sounds like a really very interesting, fun person."

146,A 39-year-old who can’t say “I love you” after TWO YEARS?!? I think you’d be smart to call it quits and stop wasting your youth on this guy.
147,This is called 'keeping score'. It dooms any relationship and is a sign of a terrible partner. Get out.
148,She seems to take pleasure in hurting you. Why stay?
149,"You’re looking for some kind of magical answer that will solve your problem. But it doesn’t exist. She’s been with you for almost a decade and has acted this way for what sounds like your entire relationship. You’ve tried resolving this issue with her through communication and she refuses to do her part every time. 

At this point, you have to re-evaluate your marriage. Are you willing to put up with this shit for the rest of your life? No? Leave. Cuz she’s not willing to change."
150,Do NOT sacrifice the well-being of your daughter to these people just because you're afraid to do what you have to do. She deserve SO much better than that.
151,"Just for the record if she hurts herself that’s not at all your fault.

She needs professional help. If this is how she’s behaving now, imagine 5 years down the track. More importantly, do you want your future children to have to endure and/or learn this behaviour. It’s deeply ingrained in her and her mother and that is beyond your control and you being in a relationship with her isn’t going to save her.

You’ve done the right thing, don’t take her back no matter what she says. Trust me they get bored and they will move on.

Look up the ‘grey rock technique’ and see if it helps :)"
152,"It would be a really good idea to have a sexual health checkup soon.

Chances are you've already thought about this but I didn't see it in my scroll through the comments."
153,I think you should lose about 180lbs of asshole.
154,Yes that's the attitude👍🏻 Think about what reaction she is expecting from you and do the opposite! It will drive her crazy and you'll have the upper hand.
155,"This is the best comment. OP, this guy is not helping you live your best life."

After 8 years, you should be his type. And I don't mean that you need to change yourself to fit what he wants- I mean that he shouldn't be flirting with someone else. Period."
160,"Also, if this is truly out of the blue and he wants to make sure it'll never happen again, he needs to see a doctor. In fact, get a second opinion as well. *Something* prompted this, and he needs to do the work of figuring out what, so that he can prevent it in the future."
161,"Exactly this! The work/life balance is key to me. I have a great job in terms of balance as I do not take my work home with me and I am able to alter my schedule to take days off when I need to and attend appointments. I love my coworkers, I love my place of work but I do not love my job nor do I strive to. I strive to have a job I can leave at the end of the day and not worry about so I can go home to my family at a reasonable hour."
162,"OK so I had a big response typed out about how you two need a big heart to heart because some people are just never comfortable saying I love you and they have different love languages. And I think he needs to be made aware of how painful this is for you.  

However reading this changed my mind. If he doesn't see a future with you after 2 years and he just ""hopes"" it'll work out, fuck that. Bounce love. He's 39 and he won't have a relationship if all he does his HOPE it works out. He has to put forth his effort into BUILDING a future with you and opening himself up to you."

164,"Don’t marry this woman. The screaming and crying about engagement at one year in should have been a clue that this wasn’t going to work out. 

I mean, let me be clear, I think you have some serious issues you need to work on, but you should do it as a single person."
165,"Yes, I have a friend who's been anorexic her whole life. I remember she excitedly told her dad ""look I gained 5 pounds"" ( she still weighed less than 100 lbs). He said with disgust ""why would you do that?""

He will not change his mind. He doesn't deserve you."
166,"You need to immediately remove your daughter's access to contact him. He is not in a stable place and in his grief could very well do something drastic if she has contact with him that doesn't go through you.

I would speak to a lawyer about next steps. It's pretty clear this marriage is not healthy, if it ever was. You need to set up a custody agreement (be VERY honest with the attorney about his threat to kill you because grief or not, that is serious) and he needs to be paying child support whether or not he chooses to see the kids.

Then, some family counseling is in order for you and the kids, even if it's just short-term. I'd also recommend individual counseling for you to deal with the loss of your child and make sure you're in a mental place to care for your children."
167,"Stop saying ""that's a first"" and putting her in an awkward position! It's still a first since it's with you. As for travelling or going places in general, it's still a first since it's with you"
168,"This is 100% an inadequate response. Pedophiles thrive &amp; get away with abusing more children because of people who ""don't want to cause drama."" This child is in danger, and if everyone else won't commit to keeping her safe at all costs, then CPS definitely needs to get involved."
169,WHAT? She bled so much she needed a pad the next day? It sounds more like the men in his family think if you don't fuck a woman till she bleeds then the first time doesn't count.
170,"&gt;she identified me by labels on mental health medications.

You are 100% justified in feeling violated.   There's not much you can do about it though since you placed the items in a place for public collection.

What you can do going forward, is be more circumspect about your personal information.  Remove labels from all prescription containers before throwing them away (we even got a spray can of label remover because the labels were so hard to get off) and *shred* anything that includes personal health or financial information."
171,"I'm so sorry you had to experience that and my heart is just broken. I would honestly take pictures of everything, and then initiate a text conversation telling them what you found and innocently asking about it ""Hey I noticed there was a bunch of broken glass, and ""accidents"" in the basement. Do you normally keep Fido down here with all of this in the dog's environment?"". Their response can also serve as evidence later in case you need to contact an animal humane society and go about finding the dog a new home. Dogs are a huge responsibility and sometimes young people get them ignorantly and don't understand how much work they are. I too would have lost all respect for them and honestly be really pissed off because that's frankly cruel."
172,The best revenge is to live well.
173,"Personally, I find silence speaks louder than words. 

You don't owe them an explanation. Ignore her and focus on you for now. It sounds like you got a lot on your plate."
174,"Have you ever tried talking to her about things and how she feels about xyz?

Why do you want to marry someone when you Haven't met her friends yet. Your lives didn't even really start yet...maybe you should pump the brakes and be more grounded"
175,"yeah like I'm seeing way more problems here than ""I hang out at a coffee shop a lot"""
176,"Wait until he learns about the chunks of uterus that come out every month! But seriously, it was insensitive and he should realize that. I get where you’re coming from."
177,"My advice is don't date a 48 year old man. Did you ever stop and wonder why a 48 year old man is dating a 19 year old girl? 19 year olds put up with their shit, people his own age would not.

Ditch the man, get a job. We all have to pay bills. Do what you want."
178,"&gt;I would fight against him trying to have sex but not to the point that I'll hurt him because I still love him  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;he wanted sex without a condom and I fought against it again. He got upset and asked me ""why do I have to force you to have sex with me?

&amp;#x200B;

I can't tell you what word to use, but to an outsider, it sounds like he was raping you?"
179,"“Scumbag” is exactly the word I was gonna use. The time to decide you don’t want kids is BEFORE you have them. Once you have one, then tough shit, buddy. You made your bed."
180,You are right. I will go. Was one of my first and rather dismal thoughts.
181,"Now, just hold on a minute.  Are you sure she speaks for your parents, and who the hell is she to tell you you're not welcome in that house?  ""Our"" house?  I think she means your mother and father's house.  I think there's a lot of subtext here.  

Your father said his Father's Day was made happier once he heard from you, and he said he loves you.  Does that sound like a man who all of a sudden is ""crying because of what you've done""?  Does that sound like a man who thinks you're a ""selfish, immature bitch"" and that he wouldn't welcome you back into his home?  Of course he would.  He loves you.  And I promise you, he misses you. 

Your sister is taking an awful big liberty, declaring that ""no one"" respects you.  Honestly, I'm sensing a lot of subtext here.  She sounds like *she's* angry, and *she's* bitter, and she's trying to hurt you by lashing out and trying to make you believe your family has written you off.  I don't believe it, not for one second.  *Her*, maybe, but not your parents.  I think your father has already shown you how he really feels.

As far as your mother is concerned, you have to remember that all she knows is that you didn't wish her a happy Mother's Day but you did wish your father a happy Father's Day.  I'm sorry to be so blunt, but on its face that sounds like a blatant ""fuck you, Mom--love you, Dad.""  She's not aware that the timing for which you decided to tentatively reach out just happened to coincide with Father's Day.

What you need to do is reach out to your father again.  Don't tell him about your sister's message (at least, not yet) because that will just create more drama and you have enough drama to deal with for now.  Ask him to bring your mother someplace neutral, a place where the three of you can talk--and *just* the three of you.  I think you'll find that their version is a whole lot different than your sister's.  As for her, you're probably going to have to deal with her bullshit for a while.  But I think you'll find that your parents just want you back, and that's a good start."
182,"You can't really help someone who isn't interested in helping themselves. You can reach out to your brother and share your concerns about him with him, but if he isn't interested in changing things, then nothing is gonna change. From the sound of it, he had an abusive childhood living with your step-dad and my guess that is something that has heavily affected his mental health. If your brother ever decides to work on himself, he'll probably need a lot of therapy."
183,"I mean... is he wrong though? He’s basically rubbing her face in it and she’s still here asking if she’s overthinking things.

OP, dump this guy. Even if he’s not having an inappropriate relationship (highly unlikely), he’s made it clear he doesn’t care about your feelings and disrespecting your boundaries."
184,"OP, I'm unclear on what you actually want to do here. Do you want to be allowed to keep screwing up major things on the regular and have her not get mad at you? Or do you actually want to work on remembering to do the things you said you would/do them correctly? Yes, your wife is not reacting well. But the stress of having to adult for two people AND three kids is...a bit much to say the least. 

It must be exhausting to never be sure if you're going to do something wrong, or forget to do it entirely, and therefore having to remember everything for you. She can't trust you to have her back on this stuff, so she has to manage it. 

What does resolution of this problem actually look like to you?"
185,"""Nice... But firmer. Your invite has been rescinded. You are consistently parking in my partner, arriving announced expecting us to drop things to help, and finally the worst, inebriated to the state of yelling, vomiting and basic public intoxication on a private community beach you have no business being on, thay prohibits alcohol. Your fun has ended. No more visits."""
186,"Our price range just covers a 1 bedroom apartment with a kitchen, living room, and possibly a dining room, in a nice part of town.

I think the big conflict is that she doesn't see why things should be used as intended. She's the sort to ask ""why can't the roof be a lounging spot?"" ""Why can't the living room be for hobbies too"" because she isn't so bothered by the impracticality of all that. 

And I don't think she really shares the want for a homey space to entertain people that I do, or really gets it for that matter."
187,"And even if he leaves the country, pursue the child support in case he ever comes back to the states."
188,I don't think OP's friend was mad at him. He was probably just disappointed that it wasn't an organic fan.
189,"""Hey, remember when I told you I wanted a divorce? Wasn't that hilarious?! Ahahahaha...""

*&lt;drops divorce papers on coffee table&gt;*"
190,"Thanks, I like this response. I think I'll change the last sentence to say that they're no longer welcome to use the beach without me."
191,"This has so many levels of partnership, humor and understanding I love it."
192,"I don't have any advice really, but I'm so sorry that you're going through this. She is a heinous person. My condolences."
193,"&gt; I want the best for her, but my heart doesn't know what would be best. If we went ahead with this, is it more for our ease or her ease?

It can be both. It can be best for everyone involved. Something that makes life easier for you and makes it easier for you to care for her, will benefit her as well. And in this instance, it seems like preventing puberty would also directly benefit her - for her, puberty will just cause a lot of confusing unnecessary changes in her life. So from what you've said, I think you should go ahead with the surgery. 

I think most importantly though, you have to understand that whichever way you decide you will *always* second-guess yourself about decisions like this. You will always have ""what if""-moments. Something or other will happen at some point in the future which will make you think ""maybe we made the wrong call"". But don't let those moments get to you, don't let yourself ever feel guilty. Because whichever way you end up deciding, you will have chosen what you believe is best for your daughter, and if you continue to care for her to the best of your ability then either choice will be the ""right"" choice, you'll make it work.

But, as I said, the surgery sounds like the better option in my opinion."
194,"My BFF's aunt was like this with my BFF's cousin. The poor child was like 12, and she had a normal belly. BFF's aunt SHAMED in front of me and everybody (it was a family birthday) and LAUGHED about how she was fat and had a fat ass. The poor child broke out crying and left. This was like 6 years ago. The kid is not fat, but she got insecurity problems about her body and her mom still points everything she can."
195,"She hit you for looking out the window.

You purposely riled her up by saying you were thinking about the woman that got her pissed 20 minutes earlier.

You lost your temper, ""seeing red.""

You're confident in the ""fairness"" of your actions, even though you admit ""by society standards"" you shouldn't have done it.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't matte who's right and who's wrong (you're both wrong). If this is how things typically go for the two of you, you two are terrible for each other."
196,A family I went to school with had their daughter get this surgery. I’m sorry this must be an terrible choice. In my opinion she can’t ever consent and if it makes your life easier and hers I think you should. It’s something definitely difficult about bodily anatomy but you should do whatever you feel is right
197,"Any time you have a question like this always ask 1 thing. ""If it was me would I want to know""."
198,Are you sure you even like this woman? You sound like you think she's an idiot for having plants on her balcony and a bed with a ladder. You don't sound like you'll be compatible living together at all.
199,"Do y’all talk about a future together? If not, AND he hasn’t said it, I think you would be smart to let him go and find someone who will say that they love you."
200,Advice from a wholesome concerned rapper.
201,I’m so sorry. I can’t even imagine. Call your family. Your friends. His family. You need support.
202,"I got kicked out when I was 18. Did the pseudo-homeless thing for a minute.

A good thing to realize is that this relationship is not just a relationship to him - it's a source of housing, stability, ability to continue at his university. It is the foundation his present life and an element of his future is based on. And there's no time you value that quite like when your last source of security is swept out from under you.

So where does that leave you?

* Above all, stay someone he can talk to. Ask questions (google ""socratic method"") about how the different things make him feel, how he's doing, etc. When the shit hits the fan, it's really important he has someone he can trust's ear.

* I'm not sure where you are relative to him, but if possible...maybe start working on your own independence a bit? When the shit hits the fan here, a place for him to crash while he sorts his shit out would be invaluable. It gives him an alternative foundation he can shift to (temporarily) if the one he's on crumbles.

* Try to not be super judgmental. That doesn't mean supporting everything he does - it means trying to understand, put yourself in his shoes, accept him and love him. If you must, expressing concern vs condemnation."
203,"A lot of your Goods and Bads seem to contradict each other. Like he's affectionate, but makes you beg for kisses? He makes you laugh, but also teases you about things that obviously bother you and gets irritated when you don't find it funny (how I'm reading it anyhow). Doesn't have a problem telling you how he feels but seems to be completely uninterested in how you feel?

A good partner should listen when you try tell them something, not just listen to the parts that are convenient for them. Him saying he doesn't need therapy for his anger issues is garbage. I feel like he needs therapy for that and a lot more. You deserve better than this."
204,"My wife would do the same. I pull over, not upset, and tell her to drive. When she asks why, I tell her that her safety advice is actually counter productive and it's achieving the opposite effect because I can't focus.
That normally does it. Now I just need to ask if she wants to drive."
205,"She's already told you to end things if you can't deal with them. You can maybe (but probably shouldn't...) beg someone into agreeing to more sex, but you can't beg someone into wanting more sex if their goal isn't to want more sex. You've said she sees it as pressure, not a healthy discussion between two people who want to get closer. All she's likely hearing at this point is that you need sex, not that you need her.

It's like if you asked her to be hungry. She could watch you eat, or she could make herself eat, but that doesn't mean she's actually going to be hungry. Imagine her eating every meal on an already full stomach because you kept asking her to be hungry. Would you still expect her to look forward to dinnertime? If this is important to you, then you need someone who actually wants what you're serving.

I'm not saying you're wrong for what you want, I'm just saying that the ghost of this horse literally told you that it's dead."
206,"Yes. I have posted elsewhere and told Mom about it. Mom and a few other relatives hate him, but their solution is to stay away/ keep a close eye on sis when she takes her to grandmas. I think I should go there to keep an eye on her while mom takes care of other matters. 

No one speaks up because they want to avoid drama. Aunt has suffered depression in the past. She has rose-colored glasses when comes to evaluating people."
207,"So... you'll basically only date someone if they will spend 9-10 hours of a day at a coffee shop? 


No willingness to engage in things they are interested? Spend time with people who are important to them? Spend time in private with them? Just someone who revolves their relationship around one single thing you like to do? 

It's possible, but unlikely to find someone who is fine with that. 

Also, the ease that you just write off possible mental illness.... something your partner will likely have to deal with. 


And the idea that spending that much time at a business without spending money (you pack a snack?) Will be considered ride to most people."
208,"I once read ""a good partnership is 40/60, with both partbers trying to be the 60.""

It makes sense to me. I've been in a relationship where I was the student with limited funds and he was working and earning. He kept track of everything in an Excel sheet to the cent,  and that didn't really feel like a good partnership.

As opposed to when I was the working partner and my SO was a student with limited funds. I feel like money is just a means to translate my work and effort into a currency that later pays for good experiences. If I pay a little more to take you to the cinema with me as opposed to me going on my own / with someone else and you missing out on it because of money, well, why would I let that happen?

I'd gladly put in a bit more because I have a bit more  and share those things with you. Not in a ""take advantage of me"" kind of way or a ""sugar mommy"" kind of way, but as in, investing in experiences and our future together."
209,Mother’s Day is also a day that husbands often celebrate their wives... for birthing and raising their children. I’m not saying he shouldn’t see his own mother but he should be a part of the Mother’s Day planning for his wife. If his children are young he should be the one to coordinate helping them get a gift for her or planning something small for her. As she should for him for Father’s Day.
210,"Women are actually \*more\* likely to be abused by a partner when pregnant- don't tell him yet. If he admits to what he did and takes complete ownership (most abusers don't) then maybe you can move past this as a couple, but I'd be terrified. I'd also check out the book ""Why Does He Do That?"" by Lundy Bancroft."
211,"I'm 35 and don't really have a dream job.  I guess my dream job would be to not have a job, but instead to have the freedom to just do whatever the hell i want all day.  Being a professional woodworker is close to a dream job, but that's not really something I see as a feasible job unless I'm not really trying to make money."
212,"&gt; I don’t get it, you know?

Well, hoss, I've got some bad news and I've got some good news. 

The bad news: you might *never* ""get it"". I don't want to think about how much of my time has been wasted trying to squeeze the seemingly irrational behavior of other people into my personal logical framework. 

The good news: you don't *have* to ""get it!"" You can make all sorts of decisions about this situation without ""getting it."" Figure out what's best for YOU, and do that."
213,"It sounds like she was just venting on a social media platform that she assumed you would never see. You seem really deeply involved in everything to do with her shower &amp; her mood around it and I’m wondering why, if you don’t enjoy her company. If you really think she is petty or unappreciative, then stop doing these ‘sisterly’ duties. It really doesn’t sound like her tweet here was personal though."
214,"The thing you said about him being hung up on her has been one of my insecurities for a while

At the beginning of our relationship, he seemed to be dwelling on her a lot, missing her, or angry about how she left, in turns. 

And I had to tell him I wasn't comfortable counseling him through stuff regarding his ex, he's gotta find a therapist to help him get past it

He did find a therapist, but several times over the years he seemed to dwell on their breakup and i had to tell him to go to therapy, not take it to me."
215,"I don't think you hurt him, he was just very excited that some stranger found his stuff and ""overpaid"" for it. 
You count, but yeah, that stranger would have been pretty awesome. Having supportive friends is great, but at some point you want to have your music to have more reach!"
216,"You shouldn't trust your GF or this dude. No one hits up random people on IG and asks them for tours. He slid in her DMs and she entertained him instead of telling him off. She knows you're uncomfortable and she's not taking your feelings into account at all. Hate to tell you this but she already has one foot out the door. Tell her if she leaves on this trip she won't have you to come home too, and *stick to that*. You deserve someone who actively chooses you and your relationship."
217,"I like you. You’re smart, resilient and in a healthy relationship with yourself. You’re going to be just fine and you know this already! :)"
218,"Agreed, these sound like paranoid delusions. Please try to get your mom to take him to a doctor, they can use a checklist to give him a preliminary diagnosis and then refer him to a specialist."
219,"Needs is too weak a word here, theres just not a better one.  It's an absolute must he gets help, it's already destroying him, it will only get worse without help.

Not only did he witness it, by giving CPR he was directly involved.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if it is PTSD plus a sort survivors guilt as he didn't save the guy."
220,"i feel like she’s the kind of person to deny it even if it was her. but that’s just my assumption, and that’s kind of wrong of me to assume. 

she’s fine, i don’t think she’d harm me but i feel like she doesn’t understand boundaries."
221,"You need to threaten to place (and be ready to follow up on) a restraining order. If they come to your place, call the cops for trespassing. Record and document everything. This shit is not okay."
222,"OP, your tolerance for abusive behavior is high because it's all you knew growing up. As adults, we often seek what is familiar to us; we find comfort in the known even if it's shitty.

So you left your abusive mom and walked straight into the arms of an abusive man.

You need to cut both of these people out of your life. Work on yourself and don't date again until you have a stronger foundation of what's acceptable behavior. Of self love and self esteem. You are worth way more than this."
223,"The guy would do the same thing to his child, which is a horrible thought."
224,"&gt; I confronted him when I get home and we got into an argument that ended in him spilling everything. He never wanted kids, he only said he did because he felt like I did. 

Not as uncommon as one might think!

&gt; He thought he would learn to love our daughter but he just feels nothing.

Also not uncommon - guys can take months to bond with their children. Many guys I talk to as a peer father share they took about 6-12 months to really bond well.

&gt;  The argument ended with him breaking up with me and spending the night in a hotel, leaving me and our daughter all alone. 

Wow, that's not common at all!

&gt; Today, I woke up to a text that he was leaving the country. I'm just shocked. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm shaking as I type this.


that-escalated-fast.jpg holy crap!! 

Call women's resource centers! And a lawyer, because fleeing the country is wild and you're gonna need to get Legal involved."
225,"Time to leave the nest, little birdie. Your mom has no business going through your things. Your mom is going to manipulate you for as long as you live at home. She will scream and cry and carry on, that is *her* problem, not yours.

Also, your parents don't need to be involved in your sex life any more than you need to know anything about theirs. Privacy, boundaries, these are things you need to enforce.

If you need more support, you might want to see a therapist about how to move into adulthood. Your mom can't keep you an obedient little boy forever and you will be miserable if you try to keep her from being upset at normal, adult behavior."
226,"A lot of people are being flippant about, “Well of course this, you deserve it..blah blah blah.” They aren’t wrong, but they are phrasing it poorly. Let’s look at it this way....

You love your wife. When you look into her eyes, you think, wow I would do anything for her because she matters to me. All I want is for her to be happy because I love her. 

One day, she comes to you and says, “Hey, honey. This thing you do, it hurts me. Like *really* bothers me. You do it a lot, and I don’t know if you know you’re doing it, but it happens all the time. It makes me feel unwanted. It makes me feel unheard. It makes me, honestly? feel like shit.” 

In a normal relationship, you, a good partner, would wilt. You would do whatever you could to make it up to her, right? Even if you fucked up a couple of times here and there (because we are all human), you’d still try to be more self-aware, to go out of your way to be helpful and loving, to show her how much you care. Right? 

**But you have made it clear that in the reverse situation, she belittles you and continues her bad behavior. She is putting her pride and her disbelief that she is wrong before your genuine pleas for understanding.** 

That is all we are saying. What you would do for your wife without thought, she is not willing to do for you. And that’s why you should take a deep breath and ask yourself if the relationship is the one you want to be in for the rest of your life. You have to ask yourself, can you put up with this kind of indifference about your feelings forever? It will be a hard ask because you should be honest with yourself. But it will pay off in the end because you should respect your needs and find someone who also respects them."
227,"Tell him he can start going alone if he doesn’t want to compromise. 
However I think this is an incompatibility that will get worse and which is pretty fundamental to each of your core values. Anecdotally I have noticed that a lot of people who need that huge family feeling or grow up used to it have no clue how to empathize or understand the other side."
228,"Dude, walk away. She does not seem to give a single shit about your feelings at all, and you deserve better."
229,Initiate smaller meetups with other child free people in the group.
230,"So you were 17 and he was 29 when you got together? Yiiiiiikes.

Look, this guy is manipulative and predatory. Please get yourself away from him."
231,"&gt;It's so much easier to let go of the feeling of ""ew I don't want a bean bag chair in the living room because I'm 30"" feeling when you understand that this is what makes her feel happy 

Nailed it. It's all about love. That's what it comes down to. If you truly love her you know what makes her happy and you want her to have those things and vise versa. Obviously if OP is miserable living with this person then that's another story but you should never try to take away anything from a s/o, be that material objects or personality traits."
232,"I was going to say he could be a pedophile but he could also just be weird. But then I thought, he's 54 but Asperger's wasn't a diagnosed condition in the US until 1994  He would have had to have been at least 30. Additionally, the first English book on Asperger's was written until 1991 so unless he's from a non-English speaking country the condition wasn't even well known when he was a child and adult diagnosis's haven't existed until recently. He's lying to you. 

Also as someone who actually was diagnosed with Asperger's as a child and gets along well with children I can tell you it's very apparent to me his behavior is inappropriate.

You should confront him on this and tell him that his behavior around children is inappropriate and to seek professional help. Maybe event contact CPS"
233,"Could he possibly freelance/work part time?  Honestly it only sounds like he wants to be your assistant to get out of working, which I get, but it sets you guys up where if this business fails it could go super poorly for you all"
234,"Your sister has been a part of your life for 29 years; you’ve been with your girlfriend for 3. In my book, the only appropriate response from your girlfriend should’ve been “I’m exhausted; but please go out and make the most of your time with your sister on this trip.” This girlfriend may be with you for many more years, or she may move on to someone else. Your sister will be your sister forever. I think you made the right choice, and if your girlfriend is going to break up with you over this, then I’d say you’re better off."
235,"I have chased my wife around at 120 pounds, and I have chased her around at 160 pounds. She is still my wife either way!"
236,"&gt;Because it's possible for two people to be together for reasons other than purely physical?

Also that a lot of men find curvy women attractive?? A lot of men even find very fat women attractive. So it's highly possible that thin, muscular man is highly satisfied with his wife's body and physical attributes."
237,He’s an adult. You gotta let him make this choice. You’re not responsible for protecting his feelings.
238,"Sounds like she is seeing someone else, and you are now the familiar side piece. The Great Backup Plan. The Plan B. The Safety Net. 

Now I'm not saying that you should necessarily take my advice; but you shouldn't have to be anybody's secondary option. Do yourself a long-term favor by blocking her out of your life."
239,"But she’s a “perfectionist” for being upset at having to survive until Tuesday without a washing machine, for wanting her new kitchen to match and (heaven forbid!) for wanting her children all accounted for. This poor put-upon man living with his big bad perfectionist."
240,"Please understand that abuse changes a person and warps their mind. He wasn’t brushing you off because he thought you were wrong, he was brushing you off because she had convinced him what was happening was his fault. I know he promised you, but he needs you right now because of his declining health. While I get that you want to be angry with him, that will only make this difficult time worse. He needs your sympathies for both his physical and emotional health. It’s like an addiction, abuse changes your brain to where you can’t understand why you’re doing what you’re doing."
241,Please don’t have children with this man.  What would happen if you had an overweight child? Everyone is different.  Is this the only area that he is trying to control. What if he had an accident and could not work out? Are you free to divorce him if he gets “fat?” He needs to see a non sports related therapist.
242,He just has this way of making me feel like he's right I'm wrong. But if I'm being honest it leaves me with blood boiling resentment.
243,"I’m going to address the thing with your mother first.... please block her and remove her from your life. This is not someone you need around. If she won’t leave you alone, you can probably get an order of protection."
244,"Babe, I'm 30. Literally nobody my age has anything in common with a teenager. It would be creepy as hell if anyone I knew brought a 18-year-old around but no one would because my friends are emotionally well-adjusted. This guy preyed on your inexperience. Please continue staring away from him."
245,"That kind of attitude gets you in the long run, but often you’re already sucked into the relationship so your mind starts to think “oh this is what it takes to be with that person”.

Some people never see the out option, and just continue. OP has seen that this isn’t the way a relationship is supposed to be, but only she will know what her limit is.

Mine was similar, but a lot less and I knew I couldn’t be the housewife and do all of the laundry and the cleaning just because I didn’t work on that sixth day. It wasn’t equal, it wasn’t working as a team. 

This kind of transactional relationship never has a future, if there isn’t other common ground or genuine appreciation and communication that goes with it."
246,"&gt;i dont have any friends ahhh the only friend i ever have at a time is the person im dating.

This is a far, far bigger impediment to a successful relationship than your tendency to hang out in cafés."
247,"&gt; I did but it came out around 2 weeks later that it was him, and that he had changed the recovery email so me changing my passwords wouldn't matter.

Why would you still continue dating him at this point? Seriously break up with him."
248,"Yep. So here’s the thing. There are ways brains work. Your girlfriend probably has great visual spatial awareness. Good at blocks and puzzles and that sort of thing, am I right? So when she drives she can see things five steps ahead and is plotting for them. I say this because that’s me too. When my husband is driving, my mental game is that I know I need to turn left in four blocks so I need to get in to that lane but that car is turning left first and there is a bus in that lane that I don’t want to get stuck behind and basically my entire mind is a giant game of Tetris figuring out how to turn left. I am a very good driver. I am also a pain in the ass in the passenger seat and I know it because all I can see is “we need to turn left and he is not going to see that car or that bus and he won’t be able to get in to that lane so it’s going to become a thing and he’ll get all stressed and if he just does this and this it will be fine.” And that is of course unbelievably annoying and disrespectful to him.

She needs to stop looking at the road as if she is driving. Look out the window, look at her phone, whatever, but she needs to turn driving mode off when she is not driving. It’s not only disrespectful and distracting, it’s dangerous because you aren’t seeing what she’s seeing, so even if you did exactly what she said you aren’t working with the same brain information, if you get me. You don’t see the Tetris game, and you can’t drive blind. You need to drive based on what you are seeing and processing, and you need to tell her exactly that. If something adverse happens, it will be 100% on you, and you accept that responsibility, but what you cannot accept is her demanding you drive based on what is in *her* head. 

Wow, I think I just fixed my own marriage. 😂"
249,"I think you dating for this long and not being invited out with her friends to celebrate her birthday is a huge red flag. Her never having let you even meet them is also a giant red flag. Courtesy and being a good partner in a relationship isn’t culture specific. She’s either just terrible at being in a relationship or honestly my gut instinct is to question if she’s fooling around on the side. Hence her keeping you completely separated. In any event no, I don’t think you’re being overly sensitive."
250,"I think the coffee shop thing is a symptom of other issues. You mention you only ever have one person in your life - the person you’re dating. That dynamic alone is dangerous to a relationship. You mention you have diagnosed yourself with some disorders but not gone to a doctor or ever tried to address those things. OCD and social anxiety are treatable mental disorders that if you put work into would improve. If the symptoms of whatever disorders you have are torpedoing your relationships it’s entirely worth it to address them with a professional and spend some of that coffee shop time working to improve yourself. Especially if you are thinking of getting a job after graduation, you won’t have this crutch to lean on anymore and will almost certainly be in a more social environment while working, so better to work this stuff out now before it starts torpedoing your career too. With attention and work can find other healthier ways to find peace and feel calm. This current strategy might have served you well in past years but it is not sustainable and not working for you if you want to be more social in a relationship and work."
251,"&gt;A few weeks after our son passed we had a particularly nasty argument which proceeded in him threatening to kill me and one of my neighbours phoning the police.

I'm so, so sorry for your loss and what you're going through right now... but your children do not need to be growing up around *anyone* who will threaten to kill you. 

If you have family or friends nearby, lean on them for support and get yourself into therapy. It sounds like this relationship has taken a toll on you, but you need to understand that you're worth more than a marriage full of arguments, distrust and threats against your life."
252,"I'm a speech therapist that specialized in working with children with severe needs/AAC systems/confined to wheelchair. 

You will have harsh arguments from either side. Instead of Reddit (I'm sure you've already done this) but I would really post in special needs parent groups on other platforms, especially those targeted for similar populations that have multiple disabilities. 

That being said, after having worked with 50+ adults of ranging cognitive abilities in a similar spot (need full-time care for needs like diapering, feeding via tube, all movement) I would choose the surgery in a heartbeat for my own child. It's quality of life for parent AND child. Lifting and ADL (activities of daily living) are SO much easier to provide quality physical and emotional care when you yourself as a caregiver aren't breaking your back."
253,"OP please listen to this!  Before having my son, there were so many red flags in my marriages but I ignored them! I used to track my weight. It usually would go up a few pounds right before my period. I had very unpredictable cycles, so weight tracking really helped me predict them. One time I gained 10 pounds, really quickly and my partner started making fun of me. Like asking me what happened, etc.


He told me I was over dramatic and emotional and childlike, too. He was self-absorbed (literally multiple selfies a day and addictive behavior on social media). He was judgemental about others, like your, and he expected others to go out of their way to cater to his wants and needs.


I should have called him on his bullshit a long time ago, but I didn't because he was ""just stressed"" or ""just really focused"" or ""he had a bad childhood,"" etc. It was all bullshit! If I had called him on it earlier, I may not have ever had my son, but I also wouldn't have exposed my child to my ex's behavior and abuse. It is orders of magnitude more difficult to divorce after a child and you have to continue seeing the person for years after. Call his BS, take a stand on a personal boundary, and when he crosses it, demand counseling or a divorce. If he's as narcissistic as he sounds, he may well be like mine and decide that if he cant get the counselor on his side, divorce is just a better option. 


Check out r/narcissisticabuse and r/emotionalabuse for more info and stories (neither are my subs, just very helpful to me.)"
254,"Yeah this is sketchy, and would definitely be outside my boundaries in a relationship."
255,"These are not small things he lied about. He endangered your health and risked his livelihood behind your back. And when given an opportunity to come clean, he continued to lie. You have absolutely no guarantee there aren't a bunch of other lies you just haven't happened to stumble across, and now you know there's no way he will volunteer the truth himself.

I know this is a shock, but you need to walk away. The trust is completely gone here."
256,It doesn't have to be a gendered thing though. She's being incredibly rude and I honestly wonder if she's like this in other parts of her life. She's telling you that her opinions/need for control are more important than your comfort. Not cool.
257,"A lot of men also gain weight during or after their wives' pregnancy due to the sympathetic hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, etc.   Some women actually end up losing weight postpartum due to breastfeeding and lifestyle changes. 

He is in intense denial about how human bodies work and very judgemental...up to OP to decide if they want to raise kids around that."
258,"You're not a moron at all, but it would be good to take some lessons away from this.

- Moving in after being with someone for only 9 months is too soon

- Someone who shouts/swears at you and makes you walk on eggshells and feel SCARED to be around them is abusive

- If someone says they have nothing to hide and when you call their bluff they get defensive, *they have something to hide*

It's good that you're a trusting person, but please also be *smart* with your trust because this guy gave you a lot of reasons not to trust him even before you actually found out he was cheating."
259,"You need to demand that he stay in your country until divorce and child support and custody are completed. 

Tell him you won’t force him into being a husband or a father, but he is 50% responsible for creating this new human and therefore he owes the equivalent of 50% of costs and 50% of time spent raising the kid. 

I know is sucks but you need to fight for your daughter’s future. She deserves that money. 

You might also want to reach out to his friends and family and warn them about what is going on. They will surely help you and their new addition to their family, and might be able to talk some sense into him."
260,"Here's the thing.  Being 16 is hard.  Everything looks larger, frustration and annoying shit grates harder on you, and it's super common and normal to feel very alone and misunderstood.

You have done a good job of outlining your feelings in your post, but honestly I don't see a lot of empathy or consideration for the feelings of the other people involved here.  When you feel frustrated about this upcoming vacation, please try to take a breath and consider a few things.  


• If your family is taking international vacations regularly and you are signed up for a study abroad program, you are already among the most privileged people in the entire world.  Don't forget that or take it for granted.


• Your parents planned the vacation when they did because they wanted to spend time with **you**, and this was their only chance.



• Your mom likes taking so many pictures because you and your family and the experiences you share matter more to her than anything else.  The next time that you're frustrated with her, consider the meaning behind the compulsive snapping.  



• Maybe your parents are just being generous with those other kids.  Maybe they're giving them a chance that they may not otherwise have.  Maybe they need to socialize more than you do.  Maybe it's a kindness to invite them along that you're overlooking.  



• Travel is expensive for adults, and vacation days rare.  This is the only time off that your parents get too.  They work harder than you do, and the grind is never ending until you're too old to continue (a harsh truth, but a truth nonetheless). Don't ruin it for them.


Basically my friend, it's not all about you.  I'm sure that these responses are not easy to read, but instead of thinking ""why are they doing this to me"", you should probably ask ""why are they doing this *for* me"".  The simple answer is because they love you.  Have fun on your trip."
261,"&gt;when we do text, it's usually to make plans

That's how a lot of people use texting - mostly for logistical purposes, and save actual conversation for in-person or on the phone. And if my SO went away with friends for the weekend, I'd assume they were having a fun time, and I wouldn't feel the need to text them all the time (or even at all) while they were gone. Instead, I'd be thinking ""I hope they're having fun,"" and look forward to hearing all about your trip in person, once you got back. 

His vagueness with the ""maybe"" plans is another matter. But in that case, it sounds like you were both vague, that instead of making concrete plans, you talked about maybe making plans, but neither of you finalized or committed to any plans, so I think that one's on both of you, and it's not like he bailed on plans with you, because there really weren't any. 

But regarding the texting, I don't think he did anything wrong here. Sometimes feelings are hurt even when no one did anything wrong. And if texting and frequent contact while you're away is something you need to feel fulfilled in a relationship, you and he might just have a fundamental incompatibility, even though neither of you are wrong."
262,"Sounds like there’s a lot more going on than the balloons. 
Have a little look over your post - easy 90% is unrelated to the issue, but highlights other issues aswell."
263,He won't *let* you? He thinks you need his permission?
264,"Welp. He communicated about as well as I’d expect. 

Go to prom. Enjoy yourself. Get dressed up, hang out with your friends, dance, take pictures, have a great time. If you want to see him afterwards you can join him and his friends and make it your afterparty. But you have no reason to skip prom just because he doesn’t want to go. If you want to do it, do it. He doesn’t seem to mind either way, so you might as well please yourself."
265,"Seconding this, as another physically disabled woman in a chair (26). I’m not sure why you’re been so heavily downvoted, TBH."
266,"He's either having a mental break or he's a psychopath.  The fact that he's ""leaving the country"" is bizarre, too, and speaks to confused thinking. Does he have dual citizenship? Because most countries won't just take an unemployed foreigner in and give them a visa, no questions asked. And quitting his job and leaving like that seems like a crazy overreaction, even if he does want a divorce.  Have you tried talking to his family?"
267,"1. Virus scan or reinstall your computer. Change all the passwords again and add two factor EVERYWHERE you can. Then check your accounts for other logged in devices and log out of anything you don't recognize remotely.

2. Break up. Right now. He committed a crime against you. This is wrong. Break up. I am entirely serious.

3. Go to the police. As soon as possible. If you can somehow make him confess over text to having done it, then that would serve you well."
268,"You are absolutely correct in not giving her any money to fuel her addiction. I'm happy you aren't bending backwards for someone who sounds like they are using you. Do you have a close relationship with your dad? He could organise for her to go on a path to recover as her addiction is getting in the way of her being an adequate mother. Also don't take her abuse to heart, she is experiencing withdrawal symptoms so she will act horribly towards you because of her unstable state of mind. Best to keep a thick skin and ignore what she says as best you can. Get a job as soon as you turn 18 and save up to move out, escape your mother as soon as you can. 

I say 18 as she won't be able to control your bank account or your decisions."
269,"This also probably has to do with their ages. Boyfriend is 29 and presumably well settled into a career. /u/Fireackllg is still a junior employee. 

Your mid twenties are usually when you start transitioning away from college-level scrimping and start enjoying life because you have the money to do so (and are probably expecting large expenses like houses or kids soon). OP's bf has made that transition, OP hasn't yet."
270,"Wtf. 100 lbs is normally considered underweight at that height.
I would be out for blood if my partner called me names for gaining 2 fricken lbs and placing myself into the ""normal"" bmi range. 

No offense but your brother needs a swift kick in the ass, I hope his wife left him or he stopped being a douche."
271,Don't overthink this. He is not an ex. It was never romantic. He is just a very close friend. It is perfectly normal to invite your SO to a close friends wedding.
272,"Dude, you’re overthinking it. It’s his damn wedding, he’s not gonna try to hook up with your girl at his damn wedding! Lol! And I have been to many exes weddings with my current bf and it is not weird at all, because you’re not there to catch up and hang out, you’re just there for emotional support for someone you were once friends with, there is nothing weird about it mate."
273,"I like you too! I know this is all super positive, but I am spending a lot of time crying and feeling abject despair. I was so very in love. But I am also not going to let this ruin anything else in my life. Thank you for being so lovely, it means the world."
274,"&gt;you're not his mom

Yeah she's just *the mother of his children* no big deal."
275,"Her life sounds like the origin story of a superhero, or a supervillain.  It's just going to depend on some defining event in her future that sends her on a path of good or evil as a technological super genius with an army of automatons.  Please just be mindful of that before you get into an argument with her about her interior decorating choices."
276,"It's really great that you're talking about this and trying to find middle ground, but it kinda sounds like neither of you really wants to *compromise*. Having all of the things separately isn't really a compromise, as nice as it would be to be able to afford a giant house with two houses worth of stuff in it. You don't want to give up any of the things you want and neither does she. That's the root of the problem - if you want to date this woman, you need to actually be willing to occasionally not get the things you want because you're doing what she wants *instead*, not just in addition to. And she needs to do the same. 

A compromise here probably looks something like, the balcony is mostly full of plants but there's a lounge chair too, sitting on the roof is fine but the screens stay and she just has to open them too when she wants to climb out the windows, the bedroom has a normal bed but also a workbench space, the living room has normal living room stuff but also the beanbag pile, the kitchen has a bookshelf or a sofa or a dining table but not all three, that kind of thing. If neither of you is willing to compromise to this degree - she *has* to have the loft bed and the separate workroom and the open windows, or you *have* to have a completely normal traditional living room and kitchen and bedroom - then you probably shouldn't live together, someone will be miserable."
277,"Maybe have both of you make lists of ""needs"" and ""wants"" for what you're looking for in an apartment.  Then see how much of a budget you have and start looking for places that check most or all of the ""needs"" and see how many of the ""wants"" you could make happen.  Compromise usually means that both of you sacrifice something.  A good compromise should leave both sides happy they got something, but still feeling like they should have gotten more."
278,"You can't fight her battles for her. You can point out to her when they're treating her badly, but you can't scold them on her behalf. Especially with such a new relationship, you have to be careful of not giving the appearance of trying to isolate your GF from her friends, as that's a red flag for abuse.

Your GF is either fine with how they treat her, or she's not comfortable asserting her boundaries with them, and you can't do it for her. You can assert your own boundaries, like declining the next hang-out with them ""because they only show up about half the time, and I don't feel like waiting around for a chump just for them to no-show again,"" or tell her you'll go, but that you're only waiting 15 minutes before bailing and continuing your night without them (and possibly without your GF, if she chooses to wait around for them) if they don't show up on time, and/or if they disappear, you'll just assume they're okay with finding their own way home, that you're not going to track them down and collect them from wherever they wandered off to. 

Maybe do some gentle probing and ask her what she likes about these women - are they the kind of people she likes, what is it she likes about them, is she fond of them, does she think they treat her well, does she like the feeling she gets from always being the ""giver"" and not having a more equal give-and-take with friends, do they share the same values; or is she just putting up with them because she craves acceptance and doesn't have other friends, and if that's the problem, brain-storm with her about how she can meet more/other people."
279,If YOU require the better more expensive neighborhood that means less space then you’re the one who should be compromising on what that space is used for. She’s already making a HUGE compromise by agreeing to move somewhere more expensive and cutting down her space by now having to share it with another person. So now it’s your turn. If you want entertaining space so badly move to a neighborhood where you can afford to have it without destroying your partners lifestyle.
280,"This.  She's giving you the opportunity to take your relationship to the next level if you want to, or to choose not to without embarrassing anyone."
281,I thought of this as well and it's a scary thought. I work in health care and actually encountered a patient like that while I was doing my residency. Will absolutely have him do some scans when I see him next. Thank you for bringing it up.
282,"You really have three options as far as I can tell

1. Stay together in a sexless marriage, which will likely eventually end anyway, because you’ll both grow bitter and angry

2. Split while you’re still on good terms. Long term, seeing two parents who are amicable even if they’re not still together is probably better for the kids than waiting until you can’t stand each other. 

3. Have you thought about an open relationship? Effectively you’d be living as roommates but given that you get along and you want to be there for your kids this might be the least disruptive solution? 


Have you had any sort of serious conversation about your relationship since she came out? What does she want?"
283,"Right now he has his card, and you have your card, right?  Each of you charge and pay for your own purchases.

What's the point of cancelling two cards and having one account?  Do you expect he will charge up personal impulse buys, then expect you to pay half?

Tell him there's no good reason to have a joint account.  Cancelling cards and opening new ones could have an adverse affect on your credit rating."
284,"Stop using her depression and self esteem issues to rationalise her cheating. People with depression are depressed, people with low self esteem as self conscious and people who are dirt bags cheat. Three distinct categories and your girlfriend falls in each of them."
285,"Grieving can be tough for a long long time so the nicest thing you can do is to keep walking those dogs for months and months, not just in the immediate period surrounding the tragedy. If you can make it an arrangement where they don't have to ask for it it would probably be even better."
286,"Let's see, boyfriend two and a half times your age, there's already so much people are going to pick up on. You're at an age where you need to live your own life, have your own experiences, rather than have someone else impose their preferences on you."
287,"Ok, the fact that OP’s SO is a shallow, selfish asshat has been well-covered, so as a pregnant person, I’m just gonna say that if she has kids she WILL gain weight. The physio probably isn’t an asshat and understands that. Not to say it won’t come off, but very likely her body will change, and if he’s not cool with that then he doesn’t actually want kids or to even be dating/married to an actual human being. So let’s look at this realistically. Here’s where the weight starts coming from when you get preggers:

7 1/2 pounds is about how much the baby will weigh by the end of a full term pregnancy, give or take a few lbs. Every baby is different. 

1 1/2 pounds is how much the placenta weighs.

4 pounds is attributed to increased fluid volume.

2 pounds is the weight of the uterus.

2 pounds is the weight of breast tissue.

4 pounds is because of increased blood volume.

7 pounds is attributed to maternal stores of fat, protein and other nutrients.

2 pounds for the amniotic fluid.

Total: 30 pounds 

(Source: Americanpregnancy dot org)

So sure the baby, the placenta and some blood will leave your body right away, but the fat stores and increased breast tissue are there for a reason. Now add to this the fact that many women get serious food aversions and many can mainly only stomach carbs in the first trimester. You may lose weight early on because of this, you may gain. First trimester is full on nausea and an exhaustion unlike anything your SO will ever feel if he is healthy, and it keeps a lot of women from working out in that trimester (btw, if he does feel a similar exhaustion I guarantee you he won’t be singing about how easy hitting the gym is). Add to this the constipation that frequently accompanies pregnancy, loosening joints and ligaments that can cause pain in run of the mill pregnancies, and the way your uterus permanently stretches to accommodate an extra human being literally growing inside you, you should really just feel amazed by the female body, but you should not expect it to be the same as it was before this miracle occurred. Now, those are just some averages based on a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy. Let’s assume you develop a serious complication like preeclampsia. This could cause significant swelling on the hands, face &amp; feet up to three months AFTER pregnancy and can be accompanied by additional weight gain. It can also kill you, but ya know, since we are focused on your BF’s priorities here let’s focus on the important side effect—you’ll likely gain weight and may not lose it quickly. Ok, so the variables could go on, but you get my drift. Gaining weight during pregnancy isn’t about being lazy—google the BBC article that says pregnant women live at the edge of human endurance—and post-partum is about, erm, bringing a life into the world!!! You will be emotional, exhausted, recovering, responsible for a completely dependent and innocent human life. You will need support!! If all this guy can see from pregnancy is weight gain, cut him loose and let him be someone else’s problem."
288,"To be fair, I think it's silly to act like you're NOT horse shit when you've been dating someone for five years and the decide to drop everything and leave. You made it very clear to her that you don't give a rats ass about her feelings. Why should she care about yours? 

You should get your entitled ass over to r/AITA and add a lot more context to this story."
289,"Also, she set him up.  She doesn't get to complain after setting him up."
290,"She took “stop texting him or I want a divorce” to mean “go have sex with him instead” and now that you’re giving her another chance, she keeps rubbing it in your face. I don’t think they’re jokes, I think she’s trying to torpedo the relationship and is too cowardly to say so. I’m sorry, but I think it’s time to start planning for the end of this relationship. Take care of yourself, OP."
291,"That is true, but he might also think OP is just paying for the music to make him feel better about himself. OP should tell him that he genuinely enjoys his music, and that is why he is buying it."
292,"&gt;  I would fight against him trying to have sex but not to the point that I'll hurt him because I still love him.

So... why do you love your rapist, exactly?

If I want to have sex with my wife, here is the full list of reasons I will accept for our not having sex:

- she doesn't want to

This is because I, unlike your rapist boyfriend, am not a rapist.

She would never have to *fight me* on this. Because that would make it rape.

Your boyfriend is abusive, manipulative, and *a rapist*. Get away from him. Stay away."
293,"Please speak up for the young kids sake. Your family members feel uncomfortable but no one is stepping up and God forbid the foster sister or the baby get molested in anyway. Involve all family members and if there is a push back, you might have to get the CPS involved."
294,"If I understand you correctly, she's perfectly happy where she is, and you want to move into a nicer neighborhood closer to work, and you can't afford that unless you add her income to yours. 

Therefore she should give up her place so that you can live in a nicer neighborhood, that she doesn't really care about.

Oh and she should give up her hobbies, too.

Got it.

Snark aside-- I'm exaggerating a little-- This sounds impossible. She needs the space she has. I can tell you, I live with someone who has projects all over the place: the kitchen table, the counters, the garage, anywhere that's clean, he'll spread out his projects. If it's not clean, he'll tidy it, THEN spread out more projects. He's a tinkerer, it's a part of his personality and it won't change (he's in his 50s and once had a home gym in the living room). I suspect your girlfriend is similar. If she gets into something and has to disassemble an X-Wing in order to build a flux capacitor, she'll do it, and probably right before a bunch of people come over, because all the counters were cleared off and she needed the space.

If you can't incorporate the space that she needs, then I strongly recommend you don't move in together. Get yourself a place as close to work as possible with room to have people over, keep it tidy and party-ready, and both of you split your time back and forth. 

Similarly, maybe she can rent a workshop instead of an apartment-- in a commercial or industrial area. 

Good luck!"
295,"She agreed in part. She said that she would try to give less advice, and that she would try to phrase it more as suggestions than orders because she doesn't consider her suggestions to be orders (I do, but maybe it's a language barrier because in French there's a clear distinction between imperative and conditional tense, maybe it's not as clear cut in English) but she also said that she's not just going to be entirely quiet in the car. I don't want to be that guy who tells her a woman should shut up when a man is driving and I know she wouldn't take it either."
296,"It’s super weird. I’m an introvert that would have a great time hanging out at a coffee house, but the fact that you won’t leave once you’re “settled” sends the message that whatever you are doing at the coffee shop (basically nothing?) is more important to you than them. You PREFER to stay there all day than to leave to see them.

If you did this once or twice a week, I don’t think any partner would care. But you are doing it almost every day, and it translates into 50+ hours a week of “me time” you’ll not compromise for your partner."
297,"It sounds like she'll already be compromising by paying more to live in an area that you deem nice. What compromises are you willing to make? I think wanting a normal bed in a private bedroom is fair, but then she can have bean bags and pillows in the living room, along with a traditional couch."
298,"I strongly disagree with those saying this is normal for your age. It is normal to dislike or not get along with your parents. This kind of visceral reaction does not seem normal to me. 

You mention your reaction when they get angry. How often do they get angry? How do they act when they're angry? What do they do to punish you? 

Once you're at college, definitely look into the college counseling services. Do you think your parents would agree to bring you to counseling now? You don't need to tell them a specific reason, something like ""I'm feeling sad and angry a lot."" If you think they won't react well to the request it may be better to wait until you have options you can access on your own."
299,"You mother could have something really simple to fix if she just got treated for it. There's loads of conditions that used to kill people that can now be fixed with tablets or even a diet change. She's being really, really stupid about not seeing a doctor.

Don't play into her foolishness by agreeing to marry your boyfriend unless you're ready to do it for yourselves."
300,I’m wondering how you came across in this conversation about your life plans. Because you seem to look down on their life choices. This could very likely be a case of not what you said but how you said it.
301,Hey you definitely should tell everyone that you now have access to their pharmacy receipts. That's something that is pretty private.
302,I'm using it because I'm nonbinary (like the X gender marker on some state licenses) but some people use it in this context because they don't want to share their gender for one reason or another or they find it irrelevant.
303,This person isn't your friend and you should just work on cutting her out of your life. She doesn't respect you at all.
304,"Definitely tell her he bought condoms and lube. If they were for her, she'll clear it up and thank you for your concern. If you go to your brother first, he will lie and become angry."
305,"She wants you to continue to be her emotional BF, but wants the freedom of being single. She wants to be able to call you and have you comfort her when she’s feeling lonely or boost hear ego knowing that if she decided to get back together you’d be there in a heartbeat, but doesn’t want to be tied down by monogamy. It sucks, she’s using you and stringing you along while not caring about how that toys with your emotions. I’m sure she still cares for you, but not enough to be committed or to give up dating other people and everyone deserves more than that from their partner.


 You’ll have a really hard time moving on or finding someone right if you let her continue to control your feelings. The best thing to do is to cut contact because that’s exactly what she’s going to do when she starts seriously dating someone new and you be left feeling more confused and worse than you do now."
306,"The quickest way to stop him from getting into your accounts is to break up with him and report it to the police because they do have time for this sort of thing. Cyber stalking is a serious crime. Hacking and messing with personal accounts can easily be seen as an offense.

From there I would call the police to his home if he continues to do it. Especially if you have an IP address pointing to his home."
307,"&gt;  I guess my dream job would be to not have a job, but instead to have the freedom to just do whatever the hell i want all day.

I mean, this. For me, there is no activity in the world that I had to do every day that I could consider ""a dream. Everything I am forced to do daily turns out to be an obligation and, as a consequence, loses much of the fun / entertainment / excitement. 

For example, I'm a gamer, and I love games. But I've spent several weeks without playing anything because I just didn't feel like it. I'm also a reading junkie and I eat books in sequence sometimes, but I've also gone months without opening a single book. And the list goes on. 

Most of the activities that cheer me up and amuse me are just like that because I have the choice to do them when I want to do, how I want  to do, how much I want to do and only if I really want to do. But take any one of them and put it as a daily obligation and immediately I can see myself getting saturated with them in a few weeks. Not that I would suddenly go on hating any of it, but I would no longer be able to see it as a ""passion"" or something like it.

I don't have any ""dream job"" because the definition of work itself is something that I don't like. It doesn't mean I'm lazy or run away from activities or my job, I always try to do my job well and get good results, but I do it because I need to work to live, not because I live to work."
308,"I don't know if I'd read into it too much.

I suspect she was wanting a change to her look anyway, and your comment gave her the confidence to make the decision."
309,"It doesn't matter what she wants, what matters is what you want. The relationship is over, it's ended, and that means you will only have as much or as little contact as both people want, and it's clear she wants much more from you than you want from her. It's ok to cut her out entirely, or to dial down the attention you give her. 

You can message her saying that you would still like to be friends/friendly but that you want to move on from the breakup of your relationship and that for you, this means cutting down contact. That this is non-negotiable and if she is not happy with that, that you are also ok to end all contact and no longer be in touch.

She clearly still relies on you emotionally and expects you to be there for her but she ended things, so you don't owe her anything. Don't give her more than you are willing to give. Her well-being is no longer any of your responsibility or business."
310,"Wow was your headline misleading. You are asking for decorating tips while the house is on fire. And, you know, I'm not sure you even see that. You are too close. You've slowly normalized a level of dysfunction that it's going to be hard to make you see it. 

I think you need to get therapy. We could wag our keyboard fingers at you all day and tell you this relationship is abusive, irredeemable, and everything else. But, you will make excuses. You'll defend him. You'll justify you relationship. You'll do all of this because that's what abused people do. It's the normal response. We can't make you see what's happening here.

So, get some therapy. They'll ask you questions and make you see things from a different perspective. Right now, you live in the zoo so you can no longer smell the monkey shit. Once you get a clean nose, you will smell what we do, though. And, you'll realize you deserve to live without anger in the house. It deeply affects you and your child and you need to learn how to leave someone like this. Best to you."
311,"I guess I've always felt like my boyfriend and I have a really high quality life together. We travel a lot even though we try to do it on the cheap it's brought us so close together. 

He's never had to cover for me financially; I've always paid my own way.

Sometimes he doesn't like how I don't pay for things for myself, like if we go to dinner he'd rather have a fancy entree and a couple drinks, and I'd rather have something cheaper and water. And he feels weird being the only one drinking."
312,"They are abusing you. Talk to a counsellor at your school and find out if there is something that can be done. At this point, being emancipated would be better than this bullshit especially considering you already aren't being taken care of properly and have to work for your own things that should be provided by parents."
313,"Flip it.  Be glad she’s not stuck with your loser brother anymore so he can hold her back for the rest of her life. 

She might be hurting but she’s better off in the long run."
314,The most rude and hurtful thing that could happen here is if your mom/family refused or tried to give back anything. Your GF has made it clear that this is what it is and culturally it seems gift giving is important to her family. They clearly have no expectations for a similar return so there is no harm or foul here.
315,"&gt; i think i might be somewhat obsessive compulsive

You think!?

If this isn't an unhealthy problem, go for a week without going to a coffee place, and just work from your home, maybe a few hours at the public library, but the majority at your home."
316,“I’m so glad my parents stayed in a loveless marriage for my sake!” said no one ever in the history of the world.
317,"His mother chose to bring him into the world and was legally obligated to provide his material needs. This does not translate into owing her anything. Her boyfriend pays for her car, why doesn't he just continue to do so? 

If your boyfriend is dead set on doing this, it should be a wakeup call for you--this is just a taste of your life together to come, with his mother coming before you and your plans."
318,"Please don't threaten to call the police or get a restraining order. Just call the police and get a restraining order.

If you threaten her with that, she may get ideas and be preemptive by calling the police on you for some made up reason, which puts her in a place of control over you and disarms your ability to follow through yourself.

It can put you in even worse trouble, and based on what you've written she may be the type to do something like that.

Imo do what you need to do to protect yourself. Best wishes."
319,"I think number one priority here is to tell him that you're no longer supporting him financially, starting yesterday.

I see how this is extremely upsetting, and I feel your pain. You broke up because the time never came to settle down, and now you see him doing it with someone who barely knows him. You need to look out for your own self now and let him live his life without you, which leading up til recently still involved you to a heavy degree, almost like you were still in a relationship.

I digress, you're essentially mourning your relationship now instead of when it actually ended, except obviously it's a lot harder now. Break all contact and STOP supporting him until you're over him. That's a lot harder done than said, but if you're committed to feeling better it's probably what's best for you. Big hugs!"
320,"I think that if he leaves the job market for two years, he may have some difficulty getting back in if your business can't sustain all of you."
321,"Ouch, this sucks. 

You know what you saw, save it all and email it to yourself ASAP. See if someone can watch the kids and ask her one thing, ""Tell me what happened in Japan, because I know.""

And then judge the reaction from there. You'll see if she trickle truths her way out of it. If she does finally admit, it's up to you to decide on whether or not you want to work it out or not."
322,"Every culture is different so I'll make some room for that in my response but personally, having grown children means understanding that they will form their own families-  ones that need love and attention and more than anything- priority. OP's husband is a grown man. He should be spending mothers day with the mother of his children- honoring her. He can his mother out the evening before for dinner."
323,"This this this. And he will likely talk the same to his daughter. I grew up with my dad calling my mom ""pork"" and similar names and always complaining about her weight. When I started puberty at 11, he became obsessed with my weight and would pat my tummy every single time I ate anything, including regular meals. When I was 12, 5'4"" and 120 lbs, he insisted my mom take me to TOPS. I started skipping breakfasts and lunches, but then I would be so hungry by early evening, I couldn't stop eating. TOPS insisted my mom get a doctor's note and the doctor refused. He tore a strip out of her instead about eating disorders, etc. He should have been talking to my dad.

OP. Do yourself a favour. Don't have kids with this man. Find a man who will love you through thick and thin."
324,"It's hard to tell from your post if your gf is committed to her eccentric styles as a way of life or is just having fun with the space she has.  

Have you specifically brought up the things your worried about with her or are you just assuming that the lifestyle you see is the one she's hard-locked into?"
325,"Practical action steps

1. Stop worryign about what he's told you or not told you.  You no longer care.
2. Move into guest bedroom tonight.  If you can afford it or have a friend to stay with, move out tonight.
3. See a lawyer tomorrow.   
4. See a therapist as soon as you can get an appointment
5. Ask your boss for 3-4 days off.  You needn't get into too many details, but say you are dealing with something really difficult at home.  Reassure them you'll be back on the day you agree.  If your boss is not a nice person, skip this step and take 1-2 sick days.
6. Exercise every single day, even if just a walk.  The data on exercise and depression/ anxiety is incredible.  
7. Call in every favor from every friend you have ever had. Go out with someone for coffee or dinner with someone 2-3 times weekly (every night if you have that many friends) and vent.  Stop venting after 30 minutes so you won't drive them crazy and can stay friends.  But it will help to get this off your chest and you will get lots of support and get your decision validated.

You \*will\* get through this.  You will be happy again."
326,Doesn’t matter if she should’ve reached out to you or not. The fact is that she didn’t. Spend your energy figuring out your next steps based on info you have. I do think you should show your mother. And also confirm with your sister if you should cancel or not.
327,"Look, it's tough and I'm sorry for you, but your relationship with her is probably done. I don't think you should hold on hope. 

Even if she can see a clear, and in your case medical, reason for the things you did, that doesn't take away the pain and trauma. Explanations are nice, but they aren't erasers. 

I'm glad your operation was a success. I think you should focus on your recovery and let her go. Don't do your life around the idea that she may one day come back, that's not fair to anyone."
328,"Change all your passwords from a different device. Go to a library and log in there. 

Then leave him. Like ASAP. This is creepy as hell. Also very illegal."
329,"&gt; I mean it could still be PPD that scared him into leaving the country.

He never told his coworkers they were expecting. He was hoping against hope he would bond with baby. But he was not into being a Dad before baby ever got here."
330,"You overcome this problem by breaking up with her.

She is immature, manipulative and cares only about herself.  Withholding sex and lashing out at you (“since you don’t trust me anymore”) is emotionally abusive. Anxiety is not an excuse to be abusive.  She is treating you this way so that you’ll give in and let her see her exes one-on-one.

Finally, you don’t trust her. It’s ok to be uncomfortable with her seeing exes 1:1, and if my gut is correct, I think you are justified in this.  Either way though, she abuses you and uses “anxiety” as an excuse. That’s not ok.  You need to get away from this person before you get too enmeshed and codependent.  And in future, don’t accept excuses for abuse and control. Someone who has anxiety needs to be going to therapy, taking medication, practicing mindfulness, etc. to treat it, not using control and emotional abuse.  

Break up and be thankful you figured this out early."
331,"&gt; Imagine having kids and him making you bare all the work load over and over again.

OTOH, I'm *sure* he'd be happy to ""pay off"" the time she spent pregnant, right? Right?"
332,"&gt; are they too overbearing or am i just rebellious?

Overbearing.

&gt; why are my parents restricting me if i've never done anything wrong?

Lot of possibilities. Culture makes people do a lot of weird things.  Your image is an extension of theirs, and they care more about their image than your happiness. Maybe they do care, but its how they were raised and it's all they ever known. I don't know. You probably won't ever know either.

There are no qualifying tests to become a parent.

&gt; how can i stop them?

You can't. Unfortunately. Out of state colleges are probably your best bet. Ideally without being financially dependent on them."
333,"Easy access to sex.

Hard to break out of a rut.

Logistics in moving out/finding a new place/ you moving out. 

Social backlash. 

Friends ""picking sides. """
334,And also that she reported back to the dad what the boyfriend had said in response to her venting.
335,"Or maybe she was still slim, just not slim enough for disordered Mark who doesn’t even understand how pregnancy works.

 But yeah, your point stands. There is such a wide variety of body types that are both healthy and attractive. OP needs to find a happier, healthier partner. This one’s mean and broken."
336,"The wife is ridiculous and obviously the one in the wrong here, but, geesh. The fact that OP thought this was endearing at first rubs me the wrong way, and I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's like when you think when a kid does something it's cute, but not when an adult does something. Like he wasn't judging her as a real person?"
337,"Talk to your wife. You are a team. She should be able to support you through this.  If you don't she will catch your vibes and may think something else is bothering you.  You learned from it so there was still growth, don't beat yourself up."
338,"Hahaha I'm a married straight woman and I feel the same way. Let the lady have her magical apartment, she sounds amazing."
339,"So it's not that you don't like sex. You don't like sex with HIM.

I don't see devotion here. I see an ""I guess you'll do"" situation that has spun out of control. I see a husband who thinks all he has to do is show up and everything is fine. I see a person who has let her life be dictated by what she thinks she should do rather than what she wants to do.

I think what you want to do is get a divorce and start over, but the first step is admitting that to yourself."
340,"Listen, I am really, really, really sorry.  My heart breaks for you.  But this is not a fixable problem.   A 27 year old who repeatedly lies, repeatedly lies.   

I  cannot explain it.  I was married to someone like this.  She would lie when she was obviously going to get caught.  And I was dumb and tried for 8 years or so to ""help her.""  All I could eventually figure out was, that she was so afraid of the immediate discomfort of an unpleasant truth, that she would lie to get out of that particular situation.

But this is far, far worse.   Telling you that he'd been tested and was clean?   That's not a little white lie to protect your feelings.  That's a brutal, planned, carefully enacted deceit about something really, really important.

People who consider deceit a reasonable way to handle unpleasant situations \*\*do not change.\*\*  

Please, see a lawyer and get a divorce.   If you get into counseling and ""think he understands now"" something worse will happen in five years, after you have kids.  

Let me say it again:  People who consider deceit a reasonable way to handle unpleasant situations DO.  NOT.  CHANGE.

I'm so sorry.  I may seem cold.  But you've suffered enough, and if you stay on you will just suffer more."
341,"Yeah, I’ve never pulled the “what happened last night!” when I actually remembered but wanted to play dumb, but my inquiries as to what happened when I was legitimately black out sound like this"
342,He's a dad and you're the same age as his kid. I don't think he's thinking anything judgemental about it at all.

344,"The thing is, her parents are not getting her the care she needs, that's why CPS should be contacted.  And you are goung to have move out as soon as you can scrape up the mone."
345,"This feels very manipulative. How long ago did he tell you he was going to book everything? Him telling you that and then waiting what I assume is at least a few weeks to tell you about his anxiety feels pretty manipulative to me. If he was having issues with your plan he should’ve been honest and communicated that to you when it happened rather than wait until a week before your vacation. 

That being said you have to decide what’s more important to you. Traveling/backpacking, and a partner who is cool with that, or your SO. I personally wouldn’t be super stoked about my husband going backpacking for months by himself but I also wouldn’t try to be sneaky about it."
346,"The ""no condom"" thing is especially troublesome given that he's made it clear he's STILL sleeping with other people. Do you really think it's only you that he is not using protection with? If nothing else, think about your health when making a decision about moving forward with this guy."
347,"The most magnificent glass of wine is rendered undrinkable by the dead fly floating in it.

348,"Second cousins?

Marriage between second cousins is legal in every US state and virtually every country on Earth.  There's virtually no increased risk of birth defects or disability.

Several US Presidents or Vice Presidents and at least 5 of the signers of the Declaration of Independence married their second cousin or closer. 

The idea that a happy couple should be split up because they're second cousins is essentially an ancient superstition."
349,"Apologize, clean his apartment, and take his car out to be detailed. 

After that, you really need to watch your drinking, cause it looks like you don't really know your limits."
350,"There has *never* been any escalation of fights, verbal abuse, or any inklings of physical violence. He's always been the first to deescalate, or the first to apologize. These recent months have just been so out of character for him, especially the other night. 

I do honestly believe that it was a one time occurrence. I feel like there are some things relating to his work that he's kept from me or has neglected to tell the full truth about and I absolutely need to know  , especially now that last night happened. 

Meeting in a public place is actually a great idea that I did not think about. I'll suggest it tomorrow morning. I really hope he'll tell me what's really going on because I just want to help him through it. 

If all goes well, I will 100% be signing us up for marriage counseling and pushing him for therapy. 

Thank you for the advice."
351,"Has he talked with the school counselor?

He needs professional help. That can be difficult for a minor to arrange on their own if the parents aren’t doing it. 

In addition to the school  counselor a local church leaser might be able to help or at least provide information about where affordable help can be found.

I agree with the others that an ultimatum about getting help may be necessary. 

Also, you might need to take a break for your own sanity (not a “we can date other people” break but a “I’m afraid to be around you until you get help and make progress” break)."
352,Could you afford a 2-bedroom home in a mid-range part of town instead?
353,"SO much better.

You're on vacation. She wanted to go to bed, you wanted to stay up to see your family. Instead of joining you or going to bed, she stayed up on her own, watched your sister's social media, got upset, and then took it out on you. It was entirely her choice to not join you!

&amp;#x200B;

There's nothing for you to do but shrug and say that you're sorry she regrets her decision to not join you, but that she's allowed to make her own decisions. If she's going to ruin the trip or break up with you over such a nonissue, good riddance."
354,"Research your destination and pick one activity that looks appealing to you, and tell your parents you want one afternoon where you get to pick where to go/what to do. Or if you need to be more delicate with them, explain you'd really like to go to X place/do X thing on your trip, and could that please be part of the itinerary.

Also learn a few helpful phrases in the native language, like being able to ask where the bathroom is, please and thank you, numbers/money, etc. There's probably a phone app for translating other things.

Make the best of being with your cousin and schoolmate. Look to them as allies - maybe together you can convince your parents that you kids are okay to stay behind by yourselves for part of the day (or okay to go off by yourselves to a cafe/beach/shopping/whatever) while your parents go to wherever they want to go. Maybe your parents go to one place in the morning while you kids sleep in, then meet back by the hotel for lunch and afternoon touring, or you all go together in the morning, then after lunch you kids go back to the hotel, then parents come back for dinner or something?

For the picture thing, the picture-taking will go faster if you don't fight it and argue. Just smile and pose and be done with it. If it truly is excessive, maybe tell your mother you'll happily pose for two pictures at each tourist attraction (like at a museum, two pictures total at the museum, not two pictures of you posing by each statue or whatever). That way she knows she'll get some pictures, and you don't feel like you're at an all-day photo shoot.

If part of your distaste for this trip is that you're an introvert, try to find some time to yourself every day - going to your room for ""a nap,"" or sitting on the hotel balcony with headphones in or reading a book, or going for a walk if your parents let you go off by yourself, etc."
355,"Yeah, why wait until you have a child. Why harm an innocent child by being in a relationship with an incredibly insecure man-child who will definitely have a very negative impact on the child’s mental health just by being the way he is?"
356,But dump the boyfriend AFTER you've had your devices cleaned so that he doesn't immediately get into the accounts and cause more harm. And I'd still talk to the police just in case.
357,When I was 16 my mom told me that if I didn't lose weight I would never find anyone to love me. 20 years later that still affects me.
358,"Rabbi here. Hi! First of all, I’m so sorry what you’re dealing with. This is some bullshit, and if you don’t have lots of exposure to Jews before, it hurts my heart that this should be your first exposure.

First of all, you don’t have a religion problem, you have an abusive parent problem. I am the first to admit that some Jewish parents can be less than welcoming to the non-Jewish partners of their children, but there are also many families that are extremely welcoming. You are right on the money that the problem is not religion per se, but that D is an abusive shitbag.

I would STRONGLY advise against converting unless you as an individual decide that you want to be a part of the Jewish people. That’s between you and your private conscience, and no reputable rabbi is going to convert you against your moral convictions. Conversion to Judaism is no joke. It’s a long and involved process, and shouldn’t be undergone lightly.

I would recommend talking to a couples counselor, and maybe also a rabbi, with your partner. If you are serious about each other you need to start deciding together about the kind of home you want to build together. That includes how you want to include Judaism in the home as well as your family’s traditions. It also means making a plan about how to deal with her abusive step father and having proper boundaries. That plan might, realistically, include much less of her mother moving forward. This process will be very painful for your partner. But you deserve to have proper boundaries as you move forward as a family.

Good luck, and feel free to PM me if you have questions. So much love and good luck for the future for you and your partner both!"
359,"I would be pissy and respond “know what would be nice?   if you’d mind your own fucking business.”  
But don’t do that...at all.  Though true, it’s rude.

The others who’ve said to ignore the whole thing are 100% correct.  You’re grown.  You don’t owe anyone any sort of explanation."
360,"That you “can’t” leave without a lot of anxiety points out that this is probably **clinically** an obsessive behavior. Do you have a psychologist/therapist you’re seeing? If not, you should definitely get see one and ask about obsessive-compulsive disorder. Your current method you’re using to deal with social anxiety and stress is becoming a problem in your social life (creating a problem with the people you date and pretty much interfering with any friends you could be making). It can be fairly easy to treat and can improve the quality of your life tremendously."
361,"Yeah, as a wife and a mom of two boys I would frickin love to make a crazy ass apartment for myself. Outlander paraphernalia everywhere, Game of Thrones themed bathroom. 4,000 candles. And you better believe I'd be climbing out on the balcony/roof to read whenever I wanted. This sounds awesome. I realize this offers no help to his question, but I'm glad she's doing it up and doing what SHE wants with her space before she has to share literally everything in life if she chooses to have a family lol"
362,"As someone who had a dream job, got it after years of working at many work-to-live jobs, and then realizing that my dream job wasn't really all that it was cracked up to be, I think you are doing just fine. 

Even dream jobs feel like a pain in the ass a lot of time. All those people who say if you find a job you love you wont work a day in your life are fucking liars. They might believe it, but it's denial.

The key to sustain a long term job is to find some sense of purpose and usefulness in it. Then you'll get a sense of pride. Doesn't mean it isn't work. After I quit my dream job I realized that all I really needed to feel fulfillment was to feel like I was serving a purpose to a cause that made me feel like I was making a positive difference in the world. That means I could work as a cook or a teacher or pretty much anything that I thought help society in some way. it doesn't need to be the be-all end-all of your life. And even with that some days just feel like bullshit. 

some people put a lot of stock into their career and it's a huge part of who they are and some people don't and that's fine. The question is is your relationship sustainable when your values are different?"
363,"Please be careful, OP. 

This person probably has seen or is about to see this post.

364,"Please remember this:

“The space in my life for the things that I want is taken up by the things that I settled for.”

My mother used to say this to me and it’s become a mantra. The message is, don’t. effing. settle. In all aspects of your life and that includes your love life. 

It’s natural to mourn a loss and this is a loss. A loss of what you thought could be. A loss of a partner. A loss of what you believed to be true when everything was brought to light. 

What he did is not a reflection of you or anything you weren’t doing right or should’ve been doing. When a man cheats, it’s a failure in him. Not the woman. 

I wish you all the happiness in the world."

There is nothing you can do other than love her and advise her to get help, not from a nutritionist, but from a therapist, cause it sure seems like she has some confidence and food issues that are the cause, and not the consequence of the problem (in which case a nutritionist would be the answer).


Coming from someone who has struggled with weight and body image for most of my life, I have found that the x-factor in my health has been intermittent fasting added to basic, not too restrictive CICO.


The key here is for her to stop looking back, stop feeling guilty for not being what she feels she should be, and come to terms with the fact that this is her weakness now and for the rest of her life, and that the only way to break the wheel is to actually accept her state now and accept that getting better will take time, patience and trial &amp; error.


The fitness youtubers don't help cause she doesn't believe she can do it. And because it's all doomed to fail from the get-go, she's probably eating and hating herself and then eating some more.


Again, from a practical point of view, let her know about IF and see if she's willing to give it a go. From a more profound point of view, let her know that it's okay to address the issue with a therapist."
372,"Tread. Carefully. You have no proof, and A denies it while sober - he could be covering up, OR could have drunkenly misspoken or bragged, in which case the fiancée doesn’t deserve this mess. You have no proof, and could seriously mess up multiple lives if this isn’t true."
373,This is so true. I only got close to my brother after my mother passed away. We managed to start detangling a rather extensive web of lies and bullshit that she used to keep us apart. Families are hard work. I hope op can keep a relationship going with her dad.
374,"He's not physically abusing you, no. 

Emotionally though..."
375,"Yes it is just the way it goes with the first baby in a young friend group.  

Don't try to act like you know the kid is doinf things for attention or that the attention is bad for his development...that just shows your annoyance/jealousy and makes it obvious you don't know much about babies.  

Try hanging out with just some of the group, invite them out or over to your place.  But mostly...this is what happens as your friends start having kids."
376,"So, going by what you said here, you don't want to give your husband ""signs of affection."" You have ""zero libido."" You're ""not ‘in love’ with him."" On top of that, you don't note that you are trying to meet his needs in any way while you note several ways he at least trying to make you happy (cleaning, being nicer, being affectionate). 

Is there anyone alive who would sign up for a marriage if they knew that was what it was going to be like?

I'm not going to judge whether you are an ""ungrateful bitch"" because of 250 words you slapped up on Reddit, but I think you need to ask some hard questions about whether you want to be divorced because that's where it sounds like you're headed. If that's not what you want, then maybe you need to make some changes."
377,"Agreed! Dump his ass, you deserve so much more"
378,"The things we have in common with a person provide the basis for understanding and communication, and the places we *differ* from a person provide opportunities to learn from one another.

So differences, in and of themselves, are not a bad thing in a relationship; in fact, they are necessary in order to keep the relationship out of a rut.  Energy only flows in an electric circuit when there is a *difference* of electrical charge across it, and the energy that flows between two partners is the same way; if they were exactly the same, there would be no challenges, nothing to talk about, no room to help one another grow...you'd both just always be in exactly the same place with nothing to say.

Where differences become an issue is when they prevent partners from having what they *need*.  For instance, if your *need* for advocacy and his *need* for self-improvement were so strong that there was no way for one of you to pursue your goals without it preventing the *other* one from pursuing his goals, then there would a a conflict that is problematical.

If your differences are things that you can accept and respect about one another, and do not prevent each other from having what you need out of the relationship (and out of life in general), then honor them as the thing that will keep the energy flowing between you two, and stop worrying about it."
379,"Oof, tough spot. She might’ve have always been the disposable “friend” and maybe doesn’t know any different. I would suggest trying to have her hang out with your group more and more. Since you guys had a good time when you went out with them. She might start getting the idea of what real friends act like. I think if you push it, she might be resentful. Show her good friendships, don’t tell her about them."
380,"Aunty is right, OP. Avoid JADE-ing. Don’t justify, argue, defend, or explain. “No” is a complete sentence. Also, OP, consider that if she moves in, she has no real reason to move out. Best of luck to you."
381,"&gt; she was angry that we were having fun without her because I receive a text how she is pissed, mad that I convinced my sister to go out instead of stay in, and is now contemplating our whole relationship. She broke down in tears when I got home and refused to sleep next to me 

This is a frankly really extreme reaction to a situation, and there's definitely something else going on. Although you saying she tends to be passive aggressive and expects you to chase after her makes me think this might just be ""normal"" for her. You talk about ""working things out"" - what is there to work out? What did you actually do **wrong**? Go out for a drink? How is that wrong? Your GF was tired and went to bed, that's fine. You weren't tired and wanted to go out for a bit, make the most of your vacation, that's **also** fine.

Just because she's mad, doesn't mean you've done anything wrong. She needs to explain what the actual problem is, and if she's incapable of that she has to acknowledge that that's *her* problem, not yours. You're right, you don't have to apologise, you can just calmly and repeatedly tell her that you're happy to have a conversation about why she's upset, but you've done nothing wrong and you're not going to beg and scrape for ""forgiveness"". If she didn't want you to go, she should have made that clear. But she also should have made clear *why* she didn't want you to go and enjoy a night out with your sister. Your feelings and needs matter just as much as hers.

You don't need to ""handle the situation"", because the situation is entirely of your girlfriend's creation. Is this normal behaviour for her? Flipping out over something minor, causing drama, expecting you to run around after her while refusing to communicate like an adult? Because none of that is healthy and you don't have to accept it as ""normal""."
382,"Yep, plus it’s called “work” not play (my wife reminds me of this all the time).  As somebody who dislikes their profession this is the right answer.  Not everybody is wired the same."
383,"It's time to start documenting dates and times. Call the police when she or anyone else shows up. Dont try to reason with her. Work on getting an order of protection and list all your documentation on your request. 

Everytime she violates that she can get arrested."
384,"No, holy shit, it is not!  Maybe cowardice is a genetic trait in this family or something, but this is absolutely your husband's job if he wants it done!"
385,"I once told a girl I loved the way she did her hair. She then did it the same way the next day. 
She was never into me."
386,"I grew up in an emotionally abusive household. I met my ex husband when I was 17. He had a less direct method of emotional abuse and after what I’d experienced growing up I figured maybe this is just the way relationships are. 

It’s obviously not, but he sure used my naivety and my childhood to push emotional boundaries and make me dance like a puppet."
387,"As someone with binge eating disorder who now compulsively hides food until I can eat without being watched, have my upvote.

OP, my father shares your husband's views. Being a teen girl in my house was not great."
388,I'd say this is the best advice.
389,i changed my passcode and i’ll change my other passwords in the morning (it’s late here)
390,"Great... But colder. ""Mom and dad, I have decided that we shall no longer be related. I will have surgery performed to change my DNA slightly so that we are no longer matches. Consider photoshopping me out of family pictures. I have changed my name. Goodbye."""
391,The only way this can work is with his mother moving out and then marriage counselling
392,"If you're 24 and she's 48, that definitely means she was fucking other people at the age you are. She's being ridiculous. Beyond ridiculous. 

You need to move out. Not just to discover your sexuality, but discover your backbone and independence. These kinds of things shouldn't stress or shame you because they're *normal*. But how would you know that when you parents have sheltered you your whole life? Do what's best for you."
393,"She is five years younger than you. She is only just getting started with her first appartement and this is what she wants. You are thirty. The place you are living in right now is not the first place of your own, is it? When you got your first place you didn't do anything because you always wanted it but your parents thought it was to impractical? Maybe she will get sick of loft beds and beanbags at some point but it's all fun and new now. Don't ruin her fun."
394,"Uhm one word: creepy. 

I should stop this before it escalates, unless you want to have a relationship with him too. Otherwise i’d advise you to stop and tell him you are not interested"
395,"&gt;I think she resents my mom for encouraging the arranged marriage idea.

Your mother arranged the marriage, she did not enlist your sister into the lifestyle she currently has. Your sister faced an enormous amount of pressure from her husband's family *and her husband* to participate the way she participates, but she had the power, and has the power, to negotiate the terms of her own marriage. I think the biggest thing you can do for her is to encourage her to renegotiate, every chance she gets. Do so subtly, but firmly. The maid idea is one negotiation. Lunch alone with her husband is another. Maybe you can get him to see what this is doing to her a bit and help his wife buck these expectations and fight his parents.

You say your sister isn't yet ready to fight for counseling. She may become more ready with time, or she may not. But one thing that may help sway her is that, unlike her MIL, she has no practical prospect of getting an easy retirement from this lifestyle. They're in the US, and this arrangement is not the norm any longer. No daughter in law of your sister's will put up with this treatment and drudgery. Hierarchies like this sometimes hinge on the promise of getting to be the one at the top someday. Your sister has no such prospect."
396,"Great, let him know that there’s a 1% chance of you inviting someone over during his trip."
397,"This is a bad idea. It he really can't stand corporate finance, there must be any number of fields where a background in corporate finance would be helpful. He should retrain for one of those (business analyst maybe). Most businesses fail. It's great your making profits now, but that could easily change. Meanwhile you have a kid to raise and another on the way, and two years of cushion goes fast. What happens if you need to redo your roof, or one of your parents needs skilled nursing care, or your car goes belly up? Plus, I'm assuming your insurance is through his benefits, that's going to be a big new expense for a family of four.

Him being a stay at home dad is a perfectly good goal to work towards, but the proposed arrangement is way too unstable. A compromise to consider is you shifting back to office work and him taking over your business (if that's possible). Somebody needs a stable job though."
398,"Deadpan, too. Not angry, just serious."
399,"&gt; ' he's 54 but Asperger's wasn't a diagnosed condition in the US until 1994 He would have had to have been at least 30. Additionally, the first English book on Asperger's was written until 1991'

Whoah! 
I was skeptical he mentioned that about himself, and maybe it is true. 
The fact that he mentioned it at all, as if it's his excuse for being a weird asshole.

Going to discuss reporting him with Mom again and be on guard for my sis."
400,"I'm confused as to why you two can only afford a 1-BR apartment with a living room, a dining room, a kitchen, and a bathroom. Because it sounds like your girlfriend is already paying for an apartment with all of that except for a separate dining room. Is the increase in rent to add a single room equal to your current rent?"
401,"This isn't any different from anyone living a high risk lifestyle. It usually comes from trying to mask pain or trauma of some sort. You can't waive a wand and stop the madness. You can talk to him and try to figure out what he's trying to medicate away. He'll need to begin a healing process to even begin to change. So, be a friend in that regard, a listening ear, and that's about all you can do. He's going to have to hurt himself as much as he needs before the ship turns. Sometimes it's fatal before it gets there and maybe you can express to him your worry. IDK what good it will do but you can try."
402,"If after 3 years, he's not thinking about it, you can be reasonably sure he doesn't see a future for you guys. Sorry."
403,"Your girlfriend sounds fucking awesome, I hope you appreciate that. That being said, it sounds like you guys should try to find a 2-bedroom place, so she can have her hobby/plant room. Or, if that's out of your price range, maybe a 1-bed with a big closet that she could convert into a maker space and a balcony for the plants."
404,"""Mom, you may have forgiven HusbandsName for the horrible things he did and said to us all, but I have not. I will always love you and support you, but I am not changing my boundary towards HusbandsName: I will not spend time with him, I will not speak to him, and I do not want a relationship with him. I ask you to respect my choice just as I respect yours."""
405,just little snide comments to a mom can be enough to make a kid hyperconscious. It's controllong behaviour.
406,I like the distracting idea and trying for a break of driving talk. Thanks!
407,"I've been in this situation before. I know it's hard to believe me when I say this because I asked a similar question on Reddit once and didn't believe people when they said it, but she's probably talking to another guy, but she's not sure about him yet, so she's keeping you as a place holder. Some girls just can't be alone, so they always need a guy to be there for them. So she's stringing you along until the other guy starts becoming more like a boyfriend to her and then she'll slowly cut contact with you without telling you why because she's a coward. Save yourself the hurt, just cut it off now. Don't be that back burner guy that helps his ex move on from him. Ex can be really cruel. Mine was and I thought she was so sweet when we dated"
408,"Has he always been like this? If not, it sounds like me be developing late onset schizophrenia. He may need legitimate mental health care"
409,If he has forced you to have unprotected sex that is RAPE. He is a bad person. Stay away from him. File a police report.
410,"I feel like you are doing that thing where you both downplay your major errors and say horrible things about yourself that makes you seem like the victim.  All of the examples you listed are big deals, especially if money is tight.  Feeling like a piece of shit for forgetting your kid is also not a solution to the problem or productive.

I would probably be at the end of my rope regarding these issues.  I’m not a perfectionist at all.  

Do you make these kinds of errors at work or only in your home life?"
411,Because a lot of people don’t understand that while bodily autonomy is important someone as severely disabled as her daughter isn’t capable of being in control of hers as she gets older. They don’t understand the abuse she could face when her parents pass on and she ends up in a care home or wherever.
412,"Hey there OP, 
   I don't normally post comments, but felt like I needed to because I live this exact scenario every day. 
   I am 32 and mother to 3 kids. I've been married for 12 years.

   I too have a lifelong ""all in your head"" illness that causes me to be unable to work, as well as unable to care for my children or myself at times. I am medicated, but it's not something that will ever get better or be cured. My husband frequently has to miss work to help me which causes a strain financially which stresses me out and makes things worse. It's a vicious cycle that leaves me absolutely feeling exactly the way you do now. 

   I constantly feel like I am a burden to my husband. He has to make so many sacrifices for me, has to pick up way more than his share of household and kid care as well as work full time. I often feel like I am just lazy or that there's nothing actually wrong with me and I am just using this diagnosis as a crutch or something. Like, one day my husband is going to just be totally sick of being tied to three kids and a sick wife and leave us all behing. I often feel as if marrying him ruined his life's potential. Definitely thoughts that are self-destructive, but it's hard not to have them.
    
   Some things that help me cope are staying on my medicine/ going to all of my doctor appointments, obviously. I'm also in therapy. It's a great tool for learning to deal with these feelings, and if you haven't tried it, I suggest you give it a shot.

   The biggest thing that helps me is that my husband is infinitely supportive of me. He knows that I am often battling these feelings, and never gets tired of reassuring me of his love and commitment. He tells me that he married me ""in sickness and in health"" and that if the roles were reversed and he couldn't take care of himself, would I stand by him, make sacrifices for him? The obvious answer is yes. In a heartbeat. I would never get tired of him, never stop loving and supporting him. I know I am absolutely devoted to him until the day I die. And when I think of that, I do actually have to pause, because I know that so deeply. I know those words are true, so when he says to me that he'll never get tired of taking care of me, of our home and our kids, I know his words carry the same weight. I know they're true, and that greatly puts me at ease.
  
   Your husband, judging by your description, sounds a lot like mine. I'm willing to bet he feels much the same way. Talking to him about your feelings, if you haven't already, might help you. And really think about, if roles were reversed, would you take his place? Love, support, and carry him? I'm sure you would, and try to hold on to the truth that you're not a burden to him simply because he loves you.

   I hope that helps! Forgive the formatting if my mobile messes it up, and please message me if you just want to chat with someone who totally gets the way you feel. ♥️"
413,"I think this reply gives far too much credit to her mother. OP needs to be completely prepared that her mother is going to be the same controlling, manipulative and toxic person she always was."
414,Thanks so much for your help!
415,is your BF my baby boomer dad?
416,"I agree, but how do I go about explaining it to my family? They are proud and already feel inadequate about the disparity in gifts."
417,"Also, she doesn’t need this stress while she’s pregnant. She’s going to be scared the entire time, trying to diet while she’s pregnant and freaking out about every pound so her husband doesn’t leave her and her baby."
418,"I mean it could still be PPD that scared him into leaving the country.

Regardless of the cause, he's still responsible for his actions. He still has time to reconcile, but he will have a lot to own up to."
419,"Five year relationship and you decide within a month to just up and move for a job? Doesn’t seem like it matters to you how she feels about the move. I mean congrats on the job but I’m not surprised she feels like you’ve wasted five years of her life. 

The fact that you don’t want to be long distance over this instead of asking her what she’s feeling and where the negative feelings came from is very telling. Stop wasting her time and end the relationship."
420,"“Hey guys, neighbors complained about Dad throwing up in the grass and being drunk and loud. You can’t come over anymore and use the beach unless we have made prior arrangements and I’m with you.”


“Hey guys, last weekend things got out of hand. This doesn’t work for me and I’m not going to lose beach privileges over this. You can’t come over without prior arrangements and use the beach and you especially can’t do that and get drunk and throw up everywhere. In the future, unless with have prior arrangements (not just a call as you’re on your way), you can’t use the beach. “"
421,Short: he won’t ever change until something drastic happens to him and he has to learn a lesson. He will always worry about his family’s happiness before yours.
422,"maybe all he should have to say is, ""My car"" and she should respond ""your car"" like a pilot taking the controls in an emergency"
423,You are right that it's better to do this sooner than later. It's SUPER unfair to your daughter to put her in a position where she might inadvertently instigate the end of your relationship with her grandparents.
424,"&gt; And further- I’m financially supporting him- how can he raise a baby!?

Remember how you broke up with him because he wasn't responsible with finances? He still isn't.

&gt;  It feels like everyone is acting like this is completely normal and that I should too.

A man and a woman having a baby together *is* completely normal. What isn't normal is the friendship you had with this guy, where he was your ex but not quite your ex. 

You feel horrible because you never quite let go of him."
425,"I think you know what you have to do here.

You just really don't want to do it. 

Hint: he's not going to change."
426,"Exactly.  Plus, this type of behavior can severely escalate to full blown stalking, delusions, and violence.  My friend's daughter is dealing with this right now and JUST got a civil protection order against her ex (who sent her over 4000 text messages in one month and called her over 100 times a day even though it all went to voice mail).  He was also stalking her, claiming he was doing work in her neighborhood whenever the police were called (which eventually was shown not to be true) and has a history of doing this to prior girlfriends.

Don't wait.  Get a Civil Protection Order or a Restraining Order against BOTH of them now.  Please record the voice mails, take note of how often she texts or calls a day (mom too) and then use it as evidence to get the restraining order."
427,Exactly how I interpreted that too. She remembers and she knows what she did
428,Cut all ties it’s not fair to you to be her backup plan or be her emotional support
429,"Honestly, the girlfriend sets off a lot more red flags than her parents. The girlfriend complains about her dad, OP agrees to avoid being the douchebag bf invalidating her feelings, and then she goes running back to daddy to say that OP doesn't him???"
430,"&gt; I'm torn between wanting to just run and hug him and apologize a million times, or hiding my face in shame when he comes back home and I don't know what is best.

My vote would be neither. I would highly suggest you put together some cash and buy him a detailing service for his car. I'd also offer to cook him dinner, take him somewhere, treat him, essentially something tangible."
431,"This sounds like a major miscommunication from my POV. I think you have reason to be upset, but at the same time, if you guys had never directly talked about going to prom together, it was a little naive IMO to just assume that he wanted to go. That being said, if he didn't want to go so badly, then he should've told you when it was clear you were putting a ton of effort into getting ready to go to prom. I think both of you are to blame here on some level, but it is completely reasonable for you to expect him to have told you earlier if he didn't want to go to prom when he saw you getting ready for it."
432,"Divorce will only negatively effect your kids if you let it negatively effect your kids. You two can be a team, and can properly co-parent your children, even if you are no longer married. 

Think of it this way: your children will be better off if both of their parents are happy, satisfied, and fulfilled in life. Those things will not happen if you stay together. A divorce is really the healthiest thing for them, provided you both navigate it properly."
433,Does she like going to parks or museums?
434,Telling her you need her to stop saying one incredibly annoying and pointless type of thing is not remotely the same as telling her she should shut up when a man is driving.
435,"Caveat to add: there are some very fair conditions/ultimatums. Things like ""If you do not get help for your illness (mental or physical), I will leave because I want to be a partner not a caregiver"" or ""If you do not get help for your addiction, I will leave because I do not feel safe""

Things like ""if you gain weight I'm leaving."" is not one of those fair things."
436,You're an adult. He can't tell you not to go. YOU DO YOU!
437,"this comment needs to be higher up, because it's obnoxious that he's keeping score."
438,"I'm a dude and I absolutely fucking hate texting. My friends and I will call each other. I just don't like a running unending text conversation. My $.02.

My wife accepts this, but, I can see how this could be a problem for other people.

I don't think he is being rude. He can try to be more considerate about it, but he won't magically turn into a super texter. It is something you need to think about in level of importance. Communication styles are big in relationships so it could be a deal breaker for you or might not."
439,"&gt;My girlfriend confessed she doesn't really want him to get into a relationship (it would break the spell) 



I'm sorry OP but your girlfriend is HORRIBLE. What an absolutely vile personality. Why is she still your girlfriend? :/"
440,Next time put a little poop in the garbage bag
441,"Did he tell you that was his preference or that it would be a huge problem if you didn't get one? Because he can have preferences without it being oppressive. It makes sense to be upset by this preference gap, since it could have real life implications, but it doesn't mean that either of you is doing anything wrong. 

There's nothing wrong with deciding that you need him to wear condoms for you to be comfortable with sex. There's also nothing wrong with deciding that you need a partner who'd be 100% on board with committing to an unplanned pregnancy."
442,Well... maybe you should rethink that. Is it more important to both of you that you live in a nicer area of town? Or is it more important to both of you that your home has room for both of you to be yourselves?
443,"&gt;I don't think she really shares the want for a homey space to entertain people that I do, or really gets it for that matter.

She already has a homey space to entertain people in her current apartment with the blanket fort beanbag pile.  It just doesn't look like how *you'd* prefer such a space to be.

Your post is very focused on all the ""negatives"" of your girlfriend's apartment and lifestyle.  The only real negative I see is that she's fine with occasionally breaking amenities until she figures out how to fix it again.  Messing with electrical wiring, even as a computer engineer, is very risky.

In fact, the nicest thing you said about her place is that ""it can be kind of fun and unique"", which is exactly how I would describe a hideous outfit while trying to avoid offending the wearer.  The biggest impression I got from your post is a dismissive attitude towards your girlfriend's lifestyle because she doesn't prioritize **your preferences** in **her apartment**.

Moving in with your partner is an exercise in meshing your lives together.  Your approach to this step seems to be oriented towards getting her to ""grow up"".  I mean, you want her to pay more for an upscale neighborhood and you won't even compromise on including her hobbies in one of the communal living spaces?  The fact that she's willing to up her rent to make you more comfortable indicates she's already the mature one in this relationship.

I'm the traditionalist in my marriage -- the kind of person who gets pictures framed rather than taping them bare to the walls.  And we have TWO workbenches in our living room, his and hers."
444,"Part of the advantage of no longer dating this dude is  you don't have to worry about his feelings and victim complex anymore. 

He didn't like how you broke up with him? He broke up with you over the phone and called you clingy. Would he have liked that?

Look, he wasn't going to like being broken up with. But it also makes sense you did. He doesn't sound like a great boyfriend, life partner, or someone who even wants to marry you. You did nothing wrong. Move on. Stop feeding into him trying to make you feel bad or sorry for him. Get some emotional distance and stop talking to him."
445,"I'd suggest not telling him about the pregnancy for a few weeks at least. Physically, you'll be able to hide it until you're about 16-20 weeks along if you wear the right clothes. So you do have time to think. 

Don't make the mistake of thinking you have to be with him for the sake of the child. 

I would meet him in public for his explanation. I would not agree to live under the same roof until he had taken responsibility for his actions by making appointments with the doctor and a psychologist.

I would also suggest that while you love your husband, if you do move past this, you have a personal bank account in just your name that you maintain as a 'just in case' fund because he's shown you a side of himself that you never thought existed. If it happened again you'd need to be prepared.

I wonder if he has lost his job, or made a huge mistake at work. Not that that excuses anything."
446,"You could 

1) Try and convince your family to let it go, and just make peace with the eccentricity that usually comes with inter-culture relationships - just be thankful this is the extent of it, other parents have to deal with may more serious differences in culture/opinion.

2) Think of a unique, not-expensive yet fun gift that your family could give their family. For a super-rich family, honestly it's pointless to try to compete through money or expensive gifts, but a fun 'cultural' gift might make it fun for everyone, and bring some peace to your family. You're really not obligated to do this though, just food for thought in case you really want to thaw the ice here."
447,"We actually had. I mean, we're not fundies. We don't want children immediately so I got Nexplanon a couple months before the wedding. Neither of us could be involved in an abortion (but we are pro choice, it's just not what we ourselves would choose) so if an unwanted pregnancy happened and we absolutely, positively were not in a position to provide for the child, or doing so would harm us in the long run (ie, not finishing school, be an insurmountable financial burden) and therefore harm future planned children, we would place the child for adoption. 

Homosexuality is a non issue. People are who they are, doesn't affect us. We never chose to be straight, no one else chooses to be gay, bi, pan, etc. We have nothing at all against other orientations.

Our VALUES are Christian and we both take benefit from the lessons in the Bible. We don't take it as step by step instructions. We wear clothes of mixed fabric and plant mixed crops lol. 

*Which is why this so bizarre for him*. He hasn't been like this with ANYTHING else. When we discussed if we wanted to wait for marriage or not we asked if either of us had had sex yet. I really felt like if I had, I could have told him I had. I hadn't planned to wait or not wait. It hadn't happened for me yet, we mutually discussed waiting for many reasons and both decided to. I didn't see this kind of idea from him then."
448,"My dad kept making comments about why I hadn't bounced back yet after my last set of twins were born, and it made me feel awful. It takes awhile for your organs to shift back into place, and up to two years for you skin to stretch back, if it ever does.

I'm pregnant with my second set now...not looking forward to the comments after the fact."
449,He sounds like the kind of person who would twist it into “you got to be off work on maternity leave so you should do all the cleaning and cooking plus I’m the one making money so you owe me” Jesus...
450,"Mother’s Day next year is already on lock for next year, believe me!"
451,"Yep, and saying ""I said I wanted kids because I thought you did"" is the biggest bullshit excuse ever.

He admitted he manipulated her early in the relationship to get what he wanted. He brought it up, not to see if they were on the same page but to manipulate her because he was worried she'd leave him if he said he didn't want kids. He lied to present a false version of himself to her. He's incredibly selfish and rather stupid."
452,"Well. He got cancer, in the throat. His opinion has been justly rewarded."
453,"Why don’t you try and come up with a plan to mitigate some of the damage from today’s fuckup, for starters. You’ve got no washing machine until Tuesday. You’re a family of five, presumably with work clothes and school uniforms to organise for next week. That’s a problem. 

- Go and google the nearest coin laundry. 
- Plan where you’re going to get coins.
- Plan to get ENOUGH coins (hint: get a lot of coins). 
- You’ll need either a laundry baskets or better still some ikea bags to transport the clothes. 
- Separate white colours and delicates before you leave to save confusion.
- Don’t forget to bring laundry liquid etc.
- Your laundry will take a couple of hours to wash and dry at the coin laundry; how will you organise the family during that time? I suggest taking the kids and a board game or two and giving Liz the break she deserves.  
- Return with flowers for Liz, and possibly some more chocolates and some gin.

She’s got every right to be angry at you and I hope you’re not considering leaving the extra work you’ve created up to her."
454,"I mean... he’s telling you he won’t say it if he doesn’t really mean it... it’s been 2 years and he won’t say it... and he won’t say it because he doesn’t feel it...

He has very clearly told you he doesn’t love you. If he loved you, he would say it. He won’t say he loves you because... He. Doesn’t. Love. You. 

If his reasoning for not saying it is that he has to feel it that means his refusal to say it is an admission the he doesn’t feel it. He does not love you. He is TELLING YOU very clearly and fairly often that he does not love you. 

Personally I would not stay with someone who openly admitted they don’t love me. I think if you cut this guy loose you would find that there are plenty of wonderful, genuine men out there who are also able (and willing) to return your feelings."
455,"That's really hard, I'm sorry.

Have you told your boyfriend he needs professional help? Try to see if you can get him to pursue therapy. Whether you stay together or not, this will help him.

Also, if he refuses then I'd try reaching out to his parents, telling them how worried you are and why, and that you really think he needs therapy."
456,"You are not 'the girl he is sleeping with', you are one of the 'many girls he is sleeping with'. Without protection!"
457,"Yes. Plus how irritating that he blames someone else for all his problems. Tired of the long commute? Didn’t apply for jobs closer to home? Sorry, that’s nobody’s fault but his own."
458,I haven't spoken to my father since I was emancipated 10 years ago. If I woke up tomorrow and somehow heard through the grapevine he had passed away I'd only feel relief as the world is a better place without people like him. I would have no regrets not speaking to him.
459,"This is good advice.  My Dad had a discussion with me telling me I’d get much less of an inheritance than my brother due to him gifting a collection solely to my brother.   This hurt because I was the one who participated in events around the collection with him.  Money was something that he was weird about and never offered to help me out when I could have really used it as a stepping stone at one point in my life.   I didn’t say anything because it was his money/collection and he didn’t have the capacity to understand how upset I was.   It was more of a power move by him to get a rise out of me.   In the end, my brother and I inherited 50/50 of the estate."
460,I used to love my long hair. Until one day I didn't and shaved it all off... Sometimes girls make snap decisions and this might be a coincidence... Ask her maybe?
461,You are insecure af.  Live in the moment.  She is with you for a reason. . . Realize that and enjoy it.
462,"The idea that everyone should have a ""dream job"" is also a relatively new concept. For so long the vast majority of people have worked to earn a living, not to fulfill a higher purpose. For millennials and Gen Z-ers, we were all given the impression from a young age that this wasn't good enough and now we're all miserable because actually achieving a dream job isn't realistic for everyone."
463,"&gt; My GF wants to go to another country to **fuck** a guy she met online a month ago

I fixed your title for you."
464,"&gt;I personally don’t think the kid needs to be showered with attention constantly like they’re doing and I think it’s a bad influence on his development.

Yeah, you really don't know anything about kids. At seven months old, the baby just figured out he has feet. He has no idea what he is doing and it isn't bad for development to give him attention.

You are jealous of a seventh month old."
465,"I agree with everyone saying you shouldn't be in a relationship if they can't support your career goals/dreams. I just wanted to add, congratulations on your recent career success!"
466,Stop enabling this drama queen.
467,"I was going to say the same thing. My first thought was, “If this mom moves in there’s no way her relation with her fiancé will last.”

YOUR life comes first, not your moms. It is not your fault if she didn’t plan well for her future. That’s on her, not on you. 

Put yourself and your relationship first. Period."
468,"Sounds like the tweet is about the guests not coming, maybe she is more dramatic than she needs to be but she might not want the event cancelled, since you are not on twitter she probably was not aiming this at you. 

Personally I would not volunteer to organize stuff for her (after this) as from your description of things this relationship looks one-sided."
469,"You should get one.  It isn't a good idea to be controlled. You need financial independence.
You may not recognise it as control but when his opinion and your fear of / anxiety about his reaction your focus, control is what it is.

A bloke should not be exerting this much influence over you. You say half a year which is the way of saying it that makes it seem like a long time  but half a year can also be known as 26 weeks.  You've been with this man 29 years your senior for 26 weeks and you are basing your life choices on what he is telling you to do 

Not good. Not good at all."
470,"Hold up. When you add your email, the coupons stop being printed?"
471,"Or even respond to the story he was telling, instead of interrupting him with her “suggestions”."
472,"The things in your post are incredibly concerning. This isn't an isolated case of a misunderstanding due to him being on the spectrum, this is repeated stalking and harassment of women, such that he has been expelled TWICE and had the police involved. 

&gt;I don't believe his behavior will escalate due to his lack of exposure to people outside the family home and inability to drive. 

So by that rationale.... if he was able to drive and get out into the general public more then his behaviour would escalate.

From your post and comments your brother KNOWS what he is doing is inappropriate and distressing for his victims - and they are victims.  He is lying about his activity and covering his tracks which suggests he is learning how to become Better at this, not trying to learn how to have healthy relationships with women.

You are excusing his behaviour and enabling him to keep doing it. Frankly he sounds dangerous to women and your family running interference between him and legal repercussions is not helping him.  It really might be time he faced consequences to his actions as he clearly understands but doesn't care."
473,"I think the day you were basically arrested because of her behaviour was the day you should have begun rethinking this relationship. 

There are a some people who are just out and out aggressive and will attach themselves to a cause in order to have a cover to excuse venting that aggression, and will look for any and every excuse to engage someone in venting that aggression. 

I wonder if your girlfriend is one of those people? The way you describe her behaviour makes it seem like she just goes around looking for fights. I've known a lot of very committed feminists - I've never known one who thought picking fights on the street at 2am was the way to go about it. I also think there is a disconnect between feminist principals and men who are 'chads'. You can be a stereotypical macho type male and be respectful of feminist values. Picking on men for being 'chads' seems like an odd choice. 

I don't think coming from a small town is an excuse really. People in small towns have education and televisions, they know what goes on in the wider world to some extent. Yes, it can take time for people to adjust to the different values of a city - but most people would not need to be taught that arguing with a drunk in the small hours of the morning is a bad idea. 

Also, she's *already* seen the negative consequences of her behaviour - which is you getting into fights and being detained by the police. Even though you've been through all that she still doesn't care - the only reason you haven't been injured is luck. 

You've explained to her that you find her behaviour distressing and she has just ignored you and batted it back to you - which is pretty uncaring. Can you imagine how you would be treated if she came to you with something that was upsetting you and you told her to grow a spine? People would be pretty disgusted with you, wouldn't they?

I'd just be careful of attaching yourself further to someone who doesn't listen to you when you are upset about something so serious."
474,Seriously. She sounds awesome and it makes me really sad that her boyfriend doesn't appreciate her.
475,"Wow, wife and kid dropped right at the end.

OP, be careful. Document what’s happening. Try asking things like “what are you and your wife doing this summer” or “how is your kid?”

What’s dangerous here is I don’t think you have enough to report, but he could take any frustration out on you with grades in future classes. 

For now, document everything. You could have an anonymous chat with your Title IV office rep. 

I suspect what’s going on in his head is that he likes the attention of smart young women. He probably cycles through them every few years. He tested your boundaries with the grades. Now he’s pushing further. Avoid him."
476,"It seems like you've thought a lot about this and discussed it with the right people, and it seems like the consequences of NOT doing this would significantly impact your daughter's life in a negative way. I say yes."
477,"I’m wary of his definition of “stable” and I’m not sure I trust it. She’s only stable 1 week out of the month and has mood swings? Maybe that happens because she has to do most of the mental load, as you said, and is exhausted 80% of the time. 

If not, yeah, sure, she should see someone too. But her being upset at OP for REPEATEDLY screwing up (like, I dunno, wrong countertops are kind of a big deal and if this is the kind of thing that happens all the time he has a problem) isn’t really something she needs to let go."
478,"This sort of happened to me. He was cheating on me with his ex the entire time. I found out from her. She knew we were together and was pretty cruel to me. He had just broken things off with her about a month prior to me breaking up with him. We were about to move in together and I thought I found my life partner. It hurts like a bitch. He &amp; her got back together as soon as I left him. 

But you know what, they deserve each other and I deserve better! So do you. We’ll make it through this!"
479,"'between ME deciding to move away and finding a job..' how did this come to happen? did you just decide by yourself or did you guys talk thoroughly and in depth about it? why isn't she coming? seems like there is a lot of stuff going on underneath, and that her being so angry and not being able to accept the fact is maybe due to her not really being included in the decision making?"
480,He's even fleeing the country to avoid paying child support. What a terrible man he is.
481,"Schizophrenia is usually genetic, so it can in fact be passed on. The fact that your uncle also has schizophrenia only increases the likelihood this is a genetic disorder."
482,"If he's having delusions you can't really just ask him, he won't know they're delusions and may become more suspicious of you"
483,"This is a question your girlfriend needs to take a firm stance on. And if she's been avoiding it for five years, it doesn't seem likely she's willing to cut her family out. Obviously I could be wrong on that, but my gut says that she would have put her foot down ages ago if she was able or willing to do so. 

As for conversion? I don't know what orthodox Judaism requires of conversion, but any rabbi worth his kosher salt will do his best to convince you NOT to convert, especially if there is any indication that you're doing so for reasons other than faith. Judaism is a culture as much as a religion, and the Jewish friends I have make it really clear that it's not something you just simply ""convert"" into. I don't think conversion will work for you or the community, because it won't be sincere. Eventually (and sooner rather than later) that will come through."
484,"yeah - the kid is 7 months old.  I think we can go ahead and not ascribe malicious intent to his antics - it's a baby, babies legitimately need attention pretty frequently and generally cannot be expected to take your board game into account."
485,"You are right, thanks for your response"
486,Its hard to convert to judaism. I want to is not an acceptible reason. Neither is for my gf. You have to prove you really want to and truly believe
487,"This is a really thoughtful comment, thank you. 

In dating I usually have a 3-flag system. You can cancel/be late/talk for too long without asking questions/be slightly rude/etc. 2 times, and then you are out. 

He hit 3 but I liked him so much I ignored it. I think my flag system was right and I should have listened to it. 

I will take a break from relationships for a while whilst I learn the horrid lessons from this one."
488,"This dude ain't even a blood relative, why tf is everyone still tolerating him? Have you checked his record? I'd do whatever the hell I could to keep kids away, I'm sorry OP, this is whack!"
489,"Feeling hurt by her job (which you met her at) does not make a ton of sense. It is a job. It pays the bills. 

It is not her responsibility to manage the fact that you feel ""hurt"" by this job. Either you can handle it, or you can't. 

Since you say that breaking up is not an option, I suggest solo therapy, if that's something you can afford. Best of luck."
490,"OP. I think a therapist might help because this is massively fucked up situation. 
Do you still have those text messages. Talk to the police and tell them about the awful text messages. It might help the prosecution's case. 

If you dad recovers, you need to have a serious talk with him. He needs his own therapist to figure out why he can't get this toxic murderer out of his life. 

You need help to figure what you need or want to do about this. It feels like a betrayal for him to be with her."
491,"Sounds like she was just venting on social media. She's probably hurt thinking that people aren't going to show up. I wouldn't take it literally or too personally. I would probably say something like , "" hey, saw your tweet. Would you prefer to not have a shower ? I don't want to put money and effort into something you're not interested in"" and see how she responds."
492,"All right.  Let's break it down once more.


&gt;They don't take vacations regularly and am only signed up for the program because of connections.


You've been to countRIES (your words) with your family that speak different languages in the past.  Having connections through college alumni programs are not something that everybody has access to!  Sorry to break it to you my friend, but you are indeed privileged.  Congrats!  It's a great thing to be.


&gt;They are going because they want to visit their hometown, not for me. I understand that this is special for them, but that doesn't justify the details they were hiding from me.


It can be both for you and for them.  Come on, dude.  Your parents want to show you where they're from, and you're giving them a hard time about it?  Have a little empathy.  One day when you're middle-aged, you might also want to share your past with your kids.

Also, which is it - is this their home town/country (where they would obviously speak the language), or will you all be wandering around lost screaming **""où est la bibliothèque""** at locals?


&gt;She only takes them because she likes it and wants to share on her social media. Even my father gets tired about it.


Who cares?  Facebook is for moms now.  It's for moms to mom it up and get validation hits from other moms.  Who is she hurting by socializing with her friends online and sharing vacation pictures?  Social media has replaced traditional photo albums.  She's documenting your lives together, and if she's anything like me, she goes back and looks at those photo albums when she's feeling down in order to cheer herself up.  What's the bfd?


&gt;My cousin is only going because my mom wants to please her sister. I don't know about the other girl.


What's so bad about doing something nice for your sister and your niece?


&gt;I agree, but I don't think I would enjoy it based on previous experiences.

It's up to you.  You say that you're being forced, that you have no choice, that you weren't consulted, etc.  But really, this is absolutely your choice.  You can choose to be miserable (and make everyone else miserable in the process), or you can choose to suck it up and make the best of the situation that you're in.  I know what I'd choose."
493,I mean...this is who she was when you met her. I'm sorry to word it this way but I'm not sure what you expected.
494,This so much.  A relationship based on 'owing each other' is just ... It's not good.
495,Do you have a good relationship with your in-laws? It might actually be a good idea to reach out if he really is leaving the country
496,"No he hasn't and dude that's what I'm actually really scared about. Idk if schizophrenia can be passed down, but my uncle also has diagnosed schizophrenia."
497,"I hear you, but they got together at 20 and 19. They sort of *were* kids (or close enough that the mindset is forgivable). I doubt that he saw himself as an adult and her as a kid, more they were both kids."
498,"&gt; He then told me it’s not a big deal and is not as bad as I am thinking, and that I shouldn’t be so upset about it 

Cool, so he did something you had told him previously you weren't okay with, then hid it from you, then lied to your face, and now he's telling you how you ought to feel about it? That's not something he gets to decide for you. He's not the boss of your emotions, and he's not the supreme arbiter of what is and is not ""a big deal."" Tell him that you certainly can't move on from this as long as he is minimizing your feelings. He needs to actually recognize what he did and its full impact on you, bare minimum."
499,"Nope.  She cheated on you, not because you had checked out of the relationship, but because she had.  She was communicating behind your back with another guy and you laid down a boundary: if she wanted to continue that, she'd do it as a divorced woman.  That was NOT unreasonable and given her past behavior, more than justified!  It was in no way justification for her to go ahead and full on cheat on you.

Now, not only did you not divorce her for continuing to message the guy, she even got you to forgive her for FUCKING HIM multiple times.  Of course she feels like she can emasculate you and rub your face in her infidelity with her jokes.  You laid down a boundary and she didn't just cross it, she broad jumped the fucking thing and you did nothing about it."
500,"The creepiness and almost-definite unhealthy nature of this relationship aside for a sec, I am rolling my eyes at this almost-50-year-old man who is too 'edgy' and 'unconventional' for a 'regular job.'  Come on, my dude.  That is a phase you should grow out of by 30 at the absolute oldest."
501,"I'd run. I've always been a heavy kid, and have struggled with my weight. During a bad bout of depression both me and my husband put on 40 lb individually. We are both getting support and therapy, and have been helping each other through depression, suicidal thoughts, and weight loss.

I can't imagine having the stress of going through daily life worried if your partner is going to dump you because you had a rough pregnancy. I've had friends bounce back quick from the baby weight, and I've had friends have traumatic births that take a while to heal let alone lose weight.

Honestly it sounds like your bf has some insecurities that make him lash out at everyone else. It's not your job to deal with it, and you're not being overdramatic for not wanting a partner like that. Having a baby shouldn't come with the stress of your partner ditching you with the new baby because you didn't magically lose weight."
502,"r/justnomil welcomes you, with some sage advice. 

It's easier to dump a mama's boy than to divorce a mama's boy, and both are easier than changing a mama's boy."
503,"Here are all the reasons in your post that show she is not ready to be a partner in an adult relationship:

&gt;she has a very weird sense of humor and never takes anything seriously so whenever I tried to have a conversation with her about where we're going, she'd usually dismiss it and change the subject saying I was too sentimental.

she won't talk seriously about your relationship...good luck with that

&gt;Her sense of humor is usually mocking me saying stuff like I don't work too much and about physical traits like height/hair.

she is one of those people that confuses ""humor"" with ""being an asshole/mocking your appearance""

&gt;She lives by herself and the first time she invited me in (a month or so ago), she told me to leave around midnight since it was getting late. The second time I got invited was this last friday. We went out to eat and she invited me to her place. Around midnight, I jokingly said I should leave since I didn't want to get thrown out and she asked if I had anything to do next morning. I assumed that was an invitation to sleep over so we started drinking and chatting and afterwards we fell asleep cuddling. Around 3 am, she suddenly wakes up and asks me to leave, bear in mind i'm pretty drunk and way too sleepy but it's her house so I leave pretty pissed off.

....just nah.


&gt;she messages me apologizing and saying if i'm still mad and if I can pick her up at a party.

Apologizes but only when she needed something from you (a sober ride).

&gt;I think that's finally when I realize it all seems way too fucked up so I get the chance to ask one final time if she's seeing other people. She kinda rolls her eyes and says she can't answer that.

Oh c'mon dude."
504,"If this is truly a one-off than he will be so horrified at himself that he will be running to make counseling and therapy appointments on his own. If you have to push for it that’s a massive sign that he doesn’t actually think anything is wrong, and that if he says the right things it will all blow over."
505,I’d be filing for divorce. If I’m honest. Because fuck living with that. And he just whines about the fuck ups instead of doing anything to help. I’m 100% sure if he had called the counter company it would have been rectified. And how do you not know your address... she can’t rely on him to pick up the kids! What does he even contribute if not more work!

507,"She sounds so cool and unique and the type of person who doesn't care about how an apartment is ""supposed"" to be. Except her boyfriend doesn't appreciate her cool uniqueness and just wants a basic standard apartment. To me it doesn't even sound like he likes her, just sees her entire personality and hobbies and preferences and annoying and inconvenient. Why date a unicorn when you just want another sheep?"
508,"It's obvious your heart is in the right place, but this post boils down to you beating yourself up for being a person who's attracted to women who isn't attracted to someone who's actively trying to change their appearance specifically to avoid presenting as a woman, which is wholly unproductive and incredibly unfair to yourself. 

You can no more flip a light switch and become attracted to a nonbinary person than a gay man could flip a light switch and become attracted to a cis woman. That's just not how the human mind works, even if the light switch would be flipping from ""not woke"" to ""woke."" You can try continuing a relationship with someone you're not very attracted to, but that won't end well. IMO your partner is making the choices they need to make for the sake of their own mental wellbeing, and you need to do the same."
509,"Speaking as someone with personal and professional experience with pedophiles, this doesn’t sound like one. He’s a user and an opportunist but you are really jumping the gun here. This is a serious accusation and you don’t have the proof to back it up. Is he weird and have inappropriate social norms with your foster sister? Sure, he sounds like someone who is using the situation of your foster sister to get out of working. 

I highly recommend to tell your parents that he shouldn’t be alone or trusted with your sister because 1) he is feeding her incorrectly and making her ill 2) hanging around tweakers 3) using her for financial gain and 4) posting pictures of your sister. This is a HUGE no no in the foster care world and your parents know that.

If a social worker was made aware of this, your parents could be in deep shit. Go that route and you’ll have more luck keeping this creep away from your sister, and hopefully your aunt and Grandma in the future."
510,"Most people see the same “Tetris game” when they’re driving, but different people have different strategies for it. For example, when my mom drives with my dad in the car, he gets upset with her because she will do things take an earlier highway exit and an extra stoplight to avoid merging right four lanes in the span of 150 yards, because he is comfortable merging the four lanes and she isn’t. They both see the same thing but they have different approaches to it and neither of them is incorrect. It sounds like OP and his SO are having a similar problem of seeing the same thing but weighing the factors differently in their decision making.

I do think you’re right that she needs to get out of “driving mode” when someone else is driving, and it sounds like it’s something fueled by anxiety—at least I think so because I do this too because of anxiety (although my comments are mainly just in my head). Maybe she’s been in a car accident in the past or maybe she just has anxious tendencies. I’m not sure how to fix that aside from the usual suggestions like breathing exercises, therapy, anxiety meds etc., but if it is anxiety it might at least help for both OP and his SO to recognize what is causing the problem."

Don't spend too much time with him for now, if it's winding you up - focus on your own life and your own friends.

519,"My own abusive, asshole father was recently hospitalized and we were unsure if he would make it through. Just like you, I was actually happy to hear that he might pass away. 

I know it's really fucked up to feel happiness when death is such a finality. But cruel people like our fathers do not deserve to be honored simply because they're dying. To have the capacity to hurt your own children signifies a very broken, bad person. They should not be forgiven simply because they now fear their own mortality. You are well within your right to keep your boundaries firm and say ""see ya in hell"" to a man who abused his 2 year old son."
520,"Holy shit, this was *exactly* my mom. She said I was overreacting to be upset by it."
521,"Op,  I...  No don't suck this up.  What the fuck is up with your boyfriend.  What level of horrible is he to make you do stuff with such a shitty excuse."
522,"Please leave him. This relationship is horribly, horribly unhealthy.

Sex with condoms is the default. If he doesn't want to use a condom, he can use his hand. His choices are sex with a condom or no sex, and it's on him to make the decision on which he'd prefer.

And please, sign yourself up for therapy. You need help in seeing how bad this relationship is, and a professional can help you."
523,Your girlfriend sounds like she is 19 instead of almost 30. If she wants to buy a ticket home tomorrow because you went to a bar with your sister then let her. Maybe she will be more level headed when she gets up in the morning.
524,I'm sorry but literally living your country because you suddenly realized you don't want to be a parent is pretty crazy. That's not your average deadbeat parent reaction.
525,"I'm so sorry that you are going through this. You description of your husband also describes me. I am in a very lucrative high stress job that takes me away from my wife. I am certain that if he hasn't ever been violent before it is very much a case where the waves of frustration overwhelmed him.

I have been there, instead of violence I just completely shut down and my sweet wife has to walk on egg shells or I will just head to my office and close the door.

It is a horrible feeling, to be both powerful and vulnerable. And it is exhausting. The exhaustion is mental and physical and can be soul crushing especially when you feel trapped in your career. The pressure to provide is hardwired into many men (and women) and it can break a person. Getting into therapy saved my life and my marriage. Having an outlet for all of this emotion is such a relief. 

Please meet him somewhere in public and discuss his situation, and see if you can get him into therapy. Then consider couples therapy. I would hold off telling about the pregnancy for a week or two. Just see how he plans on handling this wake up call. And it is a wakeup call.

Good luck."
526,"And the order will be in the legal system,  so if he comes back and gets a job,  his wages will be garnished for back support and current support."
527,"Honestly, I don’t think you guys should move in together. Why can’t she keep her apartment and you keep yours? I assume your current place is setup how you prefer?


Then she can stay at your place and go to hers when she wants to tinker and you can host guest together at your place with a traditional living room.


You don’t actually *have* to live with someone to be with them."
528,"Your parents sound rude. Your mom is refusing to investigate what her problem is, and now makes that your issue. You already invest a lot of time and emotions to the current situation of her almost immediate death, now you also should sacrifice your relationship timeline. This interaction almost sounds abusive.

You and your BF should have the time to plan for yourself. You can tell her you two aren't ready for a registered marriage and you rather wait for improvement of her health."
529,You are right.  I have a wonderful partner and he has said the same thing.  Sometimes I feel I lean too much on him to support me when I should be able to just deal with it myself.  I just don't want this to strain my and his relationship
530,"She's gaslighting you too. Notice how the phrasing of all her messages are always putting the responsibility of reaching out on you, as if it's not a two way street? ""I heard **you're** not seeing your parents"" ""Wouldn't it be nice if **you** called or sent an email to your dad for Father's Day?"" She knows what's going on and she knows exactly what she's doing, don't play into her mind games."
531,Hey if she’s falling asleep on that couch consistently then maybe she finds it comfy. Don’t try and force it on her to get up when you want her too. Let her come to you at her own time.
532,"She told you she didn’t do anything wrong. There you have it. She went on a date with another guy and held hands, almost kissed and thinks this is acceptable behavior. And she’s telling YOU how you should or shouldn’t feel about it. 

Dump her. This is only going to get worse for you. I’m sorry man. She’s probably lying on top of everything else."
533,You should consider getting therapy to deal with the emotions you're feeling regarding your mom and to manage the guilt if you do decide to cut off your mom. It is totally reasonable to not want a relationship with someone who doesn't treat you with the respect you deserve. Her being a DNA donor to you doesn't obligate you to have a relationship with her if she can't treat you with respect.
534,"Correct. 1000%

You chose familiar.

Now let that go and find kindness.  First from yourself to yourself which will enable the letting go.  

Next, filter out everyone and everything that is not good for you.  Pretty soon your life will be better than you’ve ever known.

You got this!!! &lt;3"
535,"I'd suggest saying something like ""I know you are trying to help, but you aren't. You're distracting and it is obstructing my driving"". That both recognize that you know she isn't doing it out of malice, and ""disarms"" her reasoning. If she tries to justify her helping, just repeat ""it isn't helping, it's a hindrance"".

Also makes any follow-up conversation easier, I feel, since she can't counter the argument that you're snapping (""I told you your comments impede my driving"") or that you don't appreciate her trying to help (""I know, but like I said, it isn't helpful so please stop"") and means she can't just resort to the ""I'm being helpful"" (again, ""I know, but it isn't""). Opens up for a slightly manipulative ""if you really want to be helpful you'll let me concentrate on the road, you know I've never been in an accident so I don't understand why you don't trust my judgment on this""."
536,And the bug issue is easily solved by putting up nets on velcro.
537,"I come from a similar culture and I've dealt with relatives being manipulative in this fashion.  There are ways of dealing with this but it means you have to learn to not care about social gossip.  In fact, you have to use it to subvert expectations.  

Culturally you may be obligated to take care of MIL.  But that still doesn't mean she has to live with you.  She can live with one of her other children for awhile.  Will she kick up a fuss? Will she feel demeaned?  Gossip about you?  To all those questions, yes.  But you have to insist on it in order to bring change and balance to your relationship.

I don't know whether starting couples counseling before or after getting your MIL out of the house is going to help (if you have a good counselor, then maybe before so s/he can help husband see how MIL is undermining your relationship).  Or maybe you go to individual counseling before to help you firm up your resolve first and get MIL out of the way before you work on the relationship.   

Either way, you need to start doing what you want to do - whether it is a job, wearing what you want, getting a maid, etc. and be indifferent to everyone else's comments.  If your daughter acts up, you need to punish her appropriately.  If your MIL starts undermining you, you need to draw boundaries and remind her that this is you and your husband's house, she is just a guest.  If she pulls that manipulative thing with the food again - you don't get a cake, you let everyone know that MIL changed her mind without telling anyone and that's why there is no cake.  

Above all, you have to let your husband know that things have to change in the household - that MIL's behavior is unacceptable, that it's influencing daughter's behavior and the crux of the matter is that his indifference is allowing it to happen.  And that ALL options (including a trial separation or divorce - where you leave with the kid) is on the table.  If you don't want a separation or divorce, maybe spin it as a break to go to a different country for a year with your daughter to pursue that certification you wanted.

Don't be afraid of MIL spreading gossip, don't be afraid of her temper, be calm and just stare her down and dismiss her opinions.  If you find that power within you, she will back down.  If you can't bring yourself to argue back with her due to cultural upbringing, just fake listening to her input and then go do what you want to.  This breaks her power over you and it will get worse as she panics until both, you and her, realize that her words have no affect.  

If your husband signals you to stop talking, ignore him.  If MIL or husband start ridiculing you, call them out as rude comments (there is a difference between 'you are being rude' and 'that is a rude thing to say' but it still gets the point across.)  Drawing boundaries is one of the hardest things to do when you are a person that strives for harmony, but it is a necessary lesson in life.  Model the behavior you would want your daughter to have if she was in your place - graceful but doing the right thing.   

Read up on narcissism and you will see a pattern to the behavior.  The only way to survive with one is to be indifferent to them.  The problem is daughter and husband - they are MIL's unwitting stooges and you need to distance them from her.  As I said above, she needs to rotate living among the the children.  At the very least only 6 months at your house and 6 months elsewhere.  That destroys her power base.  Make the 6 months she isn't there a happy time in your house and her poisonous ways will become clear.  Bad things fester in the shadows, calling out bad behavior brings it out into the light and there is nowhere for them to hide."
538,"As others have said, caring for the dog is huge! If I were in that position, I would feel guilty that the dog is being neglected on top of everything, and it would be a huge comfort to know that it was being taken care of.

Just taking care of their house in general is a nice gesture. Bring in the mail, put the trash out, take care of their plants, etc. That way they don't have to worry about it being too obvious that they aren't home, thus attracting a potential break in.

Being in the background, making sure the little things are seen to, is a big help. After their partner has passed, you can send some flowers and maybe make a casserole or something to put in the freezer so they don't have to cook dinner. That's what my mom always does for grieving friends :)"
539,"Honestly man not to be a dick but I thought this was satire at first. Your friend had a baby.... that’s a major life change and the kid is 7 months old. Believe me, the child does not have some secret plot to steal the attention away from you, a 25 year old man, in order to slowly kick you out of the group and claim the much sought after position of the tenth friend of the group. 

It’s okay to feel weird and maybe even bummed that things are changing but if this guy is really your friend you’ll realize his baby is obviously gonna be his priority. And if you can’t realize that you’re either a bad friend or need to grow up. That being said, there is nothing wrong with being bored of baby talk, you’re 25 still that’s very young. So forget about the baby group and find friends who are into playing pen and paper without baby interruptions. Whatever you decide to do just take a step back and realize this baby is infinitely more important to your friend than you are and he really doesn’t owe you any attention after having a baby that is 7 months old."
540,"Please repost this to r/legaladvice and r/personalfinance. They’ll have much better advice for you. You should also question your wife if she has racked up any other debt in your name. What you’ve seen may only be the tip of an iceberg.

I imagine you feel that the foundation of your marriage has been taken out from under your feet. Financial infidelity is a huge breach of trust. Your wife committed a crime against you. It’s okay to be confused. It’s okay to leave your marriage over that. Take the time and space you need to think."
541,"Breaks arnt really a thing, your either togeather, or not. It's okay for her to leave and explore her sexuality is what it is. I would definately end the relationship on your side, right now she wants you to sit at home and wait for her as some sort of after thought.. if you really love someone you dont do that. Shes choosing her sexual appetite over your love and your feelings. It's not worth waiting around for."
542,"You need to be less patient about it imho. This behaviour is only going to distract you and make it less safe, not more safe. Have a conversation with her when you're not in the car. This needs to stop. I'm sure there are lots of articles online about why backseat driving is the opposite of helpful. Maybe you could send her some links and focus on the safety aspect rather than the fact that it's incredibly annoying."
543,"in my personal experience: when your partner offers an ultimatum, that's the end of the relationship. it means their love is conditional. you don't want to be playing a role your whole life to be deemed worthy of love."
544,"Please, please, PLEASE do everything you can to keep your sister away from that man. Your instincts are telling you something is off about him...trust them! My half-sister's family - who, I want to stress, are absolutely NO blood relation to me - also has a creepy uncle. A little over 20 years ago it came out that he raped and molested almost a dozen of his nieces and nephews, the youngest being 2 years old. In order to avoid ""drama"" the family, at the behest of the grandmother, completely swept it under the rug. I was close with one of the nieces he raped and she once told me her earliest memory is her uncle raping her. She spent her adolescence in foster care and ended up a prostitute addicted to drugs. The family continued to allow him around their children, and still do. It's completely and totally fucked up.

So please, for the love of God, keep that child away from him if you can. She's a baby, and it's up to the adults in her life to protect her. Fuck avoiding ""drama."" If protecting an innocent child from the possibility of abuse is ""drama,"" then wear the drama queen crown with pride."
545,"My advice? Acknowledge you feel guilty (or whatever it is you're feeling) and *do it anyway*. Those feelings that bubble up aren't going to immediately go away, so you have to fight the feeling that you're doing something wrong. You're not. But it might feel like it."
546,"As a wife of an older husband, I agree SOOOO much here. Let. Her. Be. Herself. She'll have to manage your mid life crisis later on, let her have fun in her 20s."
547,"I'll try but it's going to be hard. Aside from trying to seek help for my dad do you think I should talk to him about my assumption? It's not really 100% since I haven't asked him directly about it, but then again I'm pretty sure."
548,"She seems to agree and understand that you can wear what type of underwear you want. It is pretty uncommon for men to wear them. 


You can tell her that it hurt your feelings when she said it was weird and that only gay guys and strippers wear them (she also the stereotype of gay guys). 


But she doesn't have to find them attractive or sexy. She can express that she doesn't like them, while understanding that you wear them for you."
549,Seriously. I think just a few weeks of that would make me change my mind real quick. I don’t know how OP has made this revelation 10 years after getting with his wife.
550,"OP your gonna have to step up and host. Of course baby will be the center of attention at your friend's house.

 As for baby talk outside the house, well your friends sound very supportive and caring of the new parent. There is really nothing you can say to make them stop that won't make you sound like a jerk. Try bringing up topics that intrest you and steer the conversation away from baby. If that isn't working then I think it's time you find other people who match your lifestyle. 

I know its lame to see people change but that's what happens in your mid 20s and 30s. For me it was the opposite experince as you. I was the first one with the baby in my friend group, Many who I found out were staunchly childfree. They stopped inviting me to hang out, and no one wanted to come to my place any more. We drifted apart. But my family oriented friends stuck with me and we are still close."
551,"You were assaulted and had to get stitches, call the police."
552,"Man this sounds infuriating. She feels like she can’t rely on you for anything. And that’s super exhausting having to do absolutely every last task because the other adult can’t even choose the correct address. Sounds like you do this type of thing a lot. Honestly write shit down if you have to, but nobody wants to be in a relationship with a toddler"
553,"I don't know that this sounds like a symptom of autism. Maybe someone can correct me, but autism means someone has to be told clearly and explicitly what behavior is necessary in a situation or what behavior to stop. Your brother has been told clearly and explicitly to stop, correct? He has been told clearly and explicitly what not to do? 


If that is the case, then this doesn't sound like it's necessarily due to autism. Does the therapist even know what is going on? It sounds like it's time for a much more serious mental health intervention; there are programs designed for men who have a history of stalking/inappropriate behavior he could be enrolled in.


&gt;We're all terrified of the day that he fucks with the wrong woman and has charges pressed


I am a little concerned that you phrased it like this. You're afraid *for him* of the consequences of his actions... but you're not afraid *for the woman* he is going to be harming and harassing? If this is how he behaves, honestly, being put in the court system may be necessary to protect women from him."
554,Thank you for the advice I appreciate it.
555,"This is a great opportunity to build a stronger relationship with your soon-to-be-spouse's cousin. I'd just text them and ask straight up how they'd like you to address their wedding invite:

""Hi CousinsOldName, your uncle had let us know you would like to be called CousinsNewName and I wanted to first say congratulations! We are getting ready to send out invitations and I wanted to ask if I was spelling your name correctly, and what pronoun you would like us to put down. We are very excited to have you at our wedding, and I am looking forward to getting to know you better as we become a family!"""
556,"and because she can't trust him to follow through, it means she never gets to let go of the mental/emotional work. There's no ""you take care of the counters"" and removing it from her mind. She's constantly wondering if he's actually going to take care of it or if she needs to check in or should just do it herself and on and on. This poor woman."
557,"Agreed. Ok, so you were manning the hot burning thing, but your wife was busy... talking to friends? You have kids now, you have to take responsibility for them. Maybe that lack of attention is why she feels like it's ok to hit people.

Yeah, he's wrong to discipline your kid. But in a world where so many parents leave it up to everyone else to do the work for them... at a certain point you've gotta own your failure here, too. Frankly you're lucky he didn't just drop her like a sack of potatoes out of shock.

If you have an issue with other people's idea of how to parent, don't force other people to parent your kid for you."
558,Not physically abusing you is so very much no the same as looking after you. He's an asshole.
559,Tell them it’s impacting your education and ask if they could buy the computer and make him pay them back directly.
560,"Honestly - my husband and I have a similar dynamic, though not as extreme (he's a constant tinkerer but your girlfriend sounds next level and kind of awesome) - and our solution was to get the bigger place in a shitty part of town.  That way I can have one floor that looks like a reasonable adult space that doesn't have bikes hanging from the ceiling (which is how we lived for a couple years), and he can have a workshop in the basement where he can be as messy as he wants.  More space (may I specifically recommend a basement, basements are amazing) is really the long-term solution to your problem, and actively seeking out cities/neighborhoods where the cost of living is lower is the best way to do that."
561,"It sounds like OP *has* told him this.   Some people refuse to hear positive things from their friends or loved ones.   It only “counts” when it’s a stranger because your friends will lie to make you feel better, or something.  It’s exhausting to try and reach through the veil of denial and self-depreciation when someone is so highly self-critical.   Just believe people when they say they like your stuff, people!"
562,"Quite honestly, it sounds like he wanted kids as part of the ""success"" package, and not for the family life.   As he moves up the career ladder, he'll be interested in showcasing his kids and their accomplishments to his colleagues but still won't be involved.    Men who want to be active in their family life, do that."
563,"\&gt;  when you're in a relationship 

This is telling.

He's not worried for your safety or ability to look after yourself. If he was, he wouldn't mention you being in a relationship making it somehow unsafe for you. 

He problem is, he simply doesn't trust you and thinks you're going to cheat on him. It's ironic that he doesn't trust you, because he told you he was going to book the trip, but he obviously didn't intend to - he was lying.

It's not a crime to be concerned about your partner, but it's not right to make that concern your partner's problem and limit their life because of it."
564,"Stop looking at him as right and look at him an effective manipulator. Is he actually right or is he just really good at convincing you he is? He knows how to attack your insecurities and create new ones so you’re so busy defending yourself that you ignore how fucked up it is in the first place the conversation is even happening. 

Spoiler: he’s a jealous piece of shit and is actively trying to drag you down to his level. Don’t do it."
565,"This lady doesn't sound that great - doesn't parent her kid (which is why he's annoying) and will throw a fit if you don't invite him to a wedding? Why even invite her at all?

If you must, just tell her she and her SO are invited only and you'd love to have them, but they'll have to get childcare for Kevin. If she asks why then you can tell her only a limited number of kids will be there because they're family. If she throws a fit, just say, ""oh"" as if you're surprised (because you should be - adults shouldn't throw fits). Then say, ""we're sorry you won't be able to make it."""
566,"You can be realistically aware that relationships can fall apart, but you should still see a future with the person you're currently dating after 2 years. Some sort of future and you should WANT to build that future with them. 

You have to open up and take that risk. 

Seems to me like he's not willing to open up and take that risk. Like he's afraid of being hurt.  Meanwhile you're still being very hurt by this. Some people really need to hear ""I love you."" So before you make any decisions, sit him down and tell him how much this is affecting you. You don't want to seem like you're twisting his arm, and I respect that, but you shouldn't keep pushing this down and letting it hurt you either. Then go from there. Whatever happens, I wish you the best of luck."
567,Yep this is what I thought also
568,"Breaking up was the right thing to do. Next step: NEVER call her back again. You are giving her the attention she wants and teaching her more harrassment = attention.

Wait a day or two and tell her you are going no contact. Start preparing to a) get a new phone number or b) get blocking apps like Hiya. Option C is calling the police nonemergency line."
569,"I'm glad I'm not the only one because I thought I was taking crazy pills when I read the post and comments. So here's a few of the stand out points where OP sounds like he doesn't like his girlfriend:

&gt;  the only place in the apartment that's half decent for hosting people

&gt; I wish she'd saved some room because it would be a nice place to sit.

&gt; Because her balcony is full of plants, I guess

&gt; a room that's supposed to be a living room, but she's gotten it set up for her hobbies instead 

&gt; Apparently she can get some parts she needs cheaper 

&gt; so there are always torn up RC cars and stuff laying around

&gt; I don't hate everything about her apartment

The constant ""I guesses"" and ""apparentlys"" show such a lack of regard for the girlfriend, how condescending. Hopefully she doesn't compromise her (awesome) self and instead finds a partner that appreciates her eccentricities."
570,"You're not being dramatic. I put on 20lbs after my kids were born, and my ex told me he didn't find me attractive anymore. It was soul-crushing, and our relationship (which was not great already) never recovered. All I could think about was that, even if I lost the weight, what would be the next thing? My hair turning grey? Getting wrinkles? A surgical scar? A lot of those have ways to fix them, but I don't want to continually be worried that my spouse wouldn't like me again after each time I had a change."
571,"Indian girl here. My cousin was in was in a similar situation-ish. She had a love marriage, and her in-laws were super nice and ""flexible."" The moment she got married though, they moved in and her husband took their side on everything.


They wanted her as a servant. No going on runs, make Indian food everyday. Stop working.  Etc. This is what she did:  

Step 1: setting the stage: Get a maid, I'm not cleaning. Oh you won't want to spend for a maid, MIL? That's ok. I'm going to have to go to work to afford one. Or you can help out. 
---MIL didn't want a maid. If my cousin was going to work, she wanted the money she brought in for herself. 

Step 2. The performance. Cousin started ignoring MIL. Going to her mom's house for meals, started working again, running again. 

Step 3: the climax: husband gets angry at wife for not performing her ""duties"" 

Step 4: the end, take a bow: my cousin tells husband that he can tell his mom to back the fuck off and start helping out and Actually being flexible OR she can divorce him and it'll be like this ALL the time again, without her extra income. 

The movie review: massive applause and  MIL backed the fuck off.


I don't know if this helps, but I hope maybe there will be something in this story to help. Just a reminder. Your sister is her own woman. In AMERICA. A gentle reminder to her husband that he and his parents are here because of HER being a citizen.  If they want to keep life going peachy keen here, treat her right."
572,"That puts things into perspective. The loss is obviously tough, but this was just such a noticeable change in outlook and behavior. I’d say that was the moment the trauma won, in her case.

I really appreciate you sharing your story. I hope you’re doing well."
573,"This is a lot more than a lack of empathy, this is someone who fails to clear the very low bar of ""decent human being,"" much less that of a good partner:

&gt;I have an awful relationship with my mother, I keep away from her. Well today she sent me a message telling me to kill myself, that she wished I had never been born, wished I had been aborted. I was fat, ugly, she never loved me. I was a bit upset, unfortunately I've been told these things since I was 8

&gt;So I came in from work, told him what happened and he freaked out at me, said ""I couldn't give a fuck, I am so sick of you telling me this shit, I don't care, you don't even like your mother, get over yourself"". It really upset me and I told him so and he stormed out.


....that's just mind-bogglingly horrific behavior by your boyfriend. There is no other way to put it than he's a real piece of shit.

Is that how you want your partner to react to you coming home and sharing that you had a rough day? If you had a daughter would you tell her that was ok for her partner to react like that? And god forbid you have an even more serious crisis, how on earth could you ever trust him to be on your side and to support you??

This behavior is shockingly bad, IMO there's nothing to work on here except your new dating profile. This guy is horrible, you deserve so much better as a human."
574,Good idea! I do have all the standard certifications in my industry but there is definitely more I can learn. Thanks for the reminder that my time can still be productive.
575,100 pounds is on the low end of a healthy weight for that height but yes it’s ridiculous someone would throw a fit over 2 pounds.
576,"Yeah, the things OP listed would make most people angry, not just ""perfectionists."" Ordering a delivery to the wrong address is a big mistake, ordering the kitchen in the wrong color is a big mistake, and worse....forgetting your own kid. That's a huge mistake. OP has a pattern of making really pretty big mistakes, and even then most easy going person would get frustrated and angry about them, especially since they happen consistently. It isn't like his wife is flying off the handle because he forgot to get milk...he forgot his own *child*. 

He should definitely look into seeing a psychiatrist and getting tested for memory disorders or ADHD/ADD. His wife should get help too, to get control of her resentment and her mood issues,  but it would be very beneficial for OP to take this step first, to show her he's serious about trying to fix this issue."
577,"I'll be honest with you, moving in with someone like you would be a deal breaker for me. I don't have a fort or anything, but my home is just that- mine. I don't feel the need to make it a space to cater to guests. I'm not going out of my way to shun them, and honestly most of my friends would prefer to curl up with drinks in a blanket fort rather than a typical living room anyways. But I wouldn't give up my hobbies (plants, reading nook, whatever) to make my boyfriend feel better about having his friends over."
578,"Look, you can't help your sexual orientation any more than they can help their gender identity. You're straight and want to date a woman. They are no longer presenting as a woman. It's really as simple as that. You don't need a therapist to convince yourself to date outside of your sexual orientation. It's great that you're so accepting but there's a point at which being ""woke"" is just detrimental for everyone. You deserve to date someone you're wildly attracted to without forcing it, and they deserve to date someone who is wildly attracted to them without forcing it."
579,"Oof, I’m a retired professional ballet dancer, so I feel this one on a personal level.

His ballet company dreams are not going to work out. 28 is too old, especially since he’s at the apprentice level and not the soloist or principal level. 

If the cruise contract is not ridiculously long, it might be worthwhile for him to do one and then try to use that experience to get steadier entertainment work at Disneyland or something along those lines.

It also might be time for him to figure out a non-dancing career. Dancers tend to pivot well into other careers, we’re used to working hard. My ex-dancer friends are now physical therapists and lawyers and such.

On your end, you have to talk to him about his long-term plans. If he has an idea of what he wants to do and you think you can handle that future, maybe you can stay together. However, if he still doesn’t know and he just wants to chase whatever performing opportunities come his way... that might be a bad sign for the relationship."
580,"Tell the groom *exactly* what you've experienced. Don't say ""so and so fucked your wife"", say ""I heard this, investigated a bit more and found out this, I don't know what really happened"".

You're not a judge or detective or PI or anything, you're a bystander with an unreliable story. Treat it as such, tell the husband *everything*, and then disengage as much as possible. Do *not* get more involved."
581,"Holy shit. I am baffled by the amount of responses questioning if your partner was ""actually lying"" by omitting the fact they used to be a man. Yes. Yes they fucking lied. 

Are you all nuts?"
582,"This is my thought as well. OP needs to tell her he can be in her life (meaning be together) or not at all. This just smacks of her finding someone else who interests her, so she wants to put the relationship on hold while she figures it out. To use the cliché, she wants to have her cake and eat it too."
583,"You are probably right, i was thinking the same thing as I read the post. That means he likely fetishized and fantasized about her hurting and bleeding the first time he had sex with her. Yikes!"
584,"It's not petty. It's definitely assault, and it's abuse for the parents to allow it. 

Definitely call the police. Get this on record. Tell the police that they are talking about shipping you off to a reform camp because of the property damage. Be frank about that.

Do *anything* you can to prevent being shipped off to one of those camps. Once you are in their custody, you might not be able to get out and really bad things can happen there. Physical and sexual abuse are rampant and people will not help you once you're there. Get the help before it comes to that."
585,"I'd be considering leaving after all of that plus forgetting to pick up a child.  That isn't just screwing up. Plus I'd be wondering why he didn't screw up things he enjoyed just stuff that was required from a parent, partner and adult. 

Also lol at him saying its her mental health that's causing this or her perfectionism.  No op.  You fucked up huge stuff and culminated with something so simple to get right that I'm wondering how you never once noticed you got it wrong."
586,"In my experience, even a ""dream job"" will have some parts you don't like &amp; sometimes those parts can overwhelm the good. 

What makes someone happy at their job is very personal--for me, it's a near tie between personal autonomy (not being micromanaged) &amp; compensation."
587,"&gt;&gt;he doesn’t understand why I am upset,

You should take it his statement at face value: being a husband and father will never be important to him and that if you want to live with a different set of priorities, it will have to be with someone else.

If you stay with him another 15 years, he'll wonder why everyone else's kids visit all the time while yours stay away."
588,"Are you prepared for him to grant your request and cease all communication with you? It's human nature to want a parent to care for you and for it to hurt if they don't show that affection. Is it possible you are penning this letter in hopes that he will see the error of his ways and apologize, hence validating your (completely understandable) feelings?"
589,"Do they still live a few states apart? The way I see it, they’re 16, having a long distance romance, this will most likely eventually fizzle out. You won’t do your family or your relationship with your daughter any favours by making a big deal and exposing them - the best thing you can probably do is to just let it run its course. I get why you feel that it’s icky, though."
590,Same. There's a spicy ending to this.
591,"&gt;So fiancee and I drove up **almost every other weekend** to h**elp them  de-clutter** the rooms his parents were going to stay and, **help fix up the  deck**, **do some yard work**, etc.  **We helped them a lot** and they  appreciated the time and effort we made to come help, but my parents  really kicked it into high gear to get the house ready.

Your fiancee put a lot of time and effort into helping get your parents house ready for guests, he didn't just expect it, he **helped**

&gt;Fiancee mentions he wants to call my mom in the car and thank her ***again*** for hosting his parents.

Which means he already thanked her...right??

I don't think your fiance meant to slight your parents, he was allaying his parents fears they hadn't given enough

I think y'all need to cool your jets, and quit demonizing your poor fiance"
592,"“consider that if she moves in, she has no real reason to move out”

^^^^ this"
593,"This - Legos and indoor games are fun, but what my own eight-year-old really loves doing is going interesting places. It's actually a cool age for that. Suddenly you can take her to grown-up museums, to coffee shops, to cool parts of the city (if you're in a city), to sporting events;  you can ride decent rides with her at amusement parks;  you can go biking; you can just go out and explore and talk about the world around you. Obviously every kid is different, and 8-year-olds are still very much kids, but in my own experience they're at an age where they're less interested in playing with toys and more interested in trying out (the kid-friendlier side of) grown-up activities, and figuring out what they like. It's a lot of fun. Respect that she wants to be taken seriously as a person and talked to like someone who is capable of understanding things, make sure you listen to what she says, and you'll get along great."
594,"""I'm really sorry for how I behaved the other night. It was absolutely uncalled for when I told you to fuck off, and I regret it. The truth is, that I'm struggling a bit with needing some more time to myself to write. I need at least 1-2 hours a night of uninterrupted writing time. Can you find something to do for that time, and the rest we can spend together? Headphones in = writing."""
595,"I have to disagree with most of the other posters here. It's normal to be busy for a week, but not so busy that you can't spend 1 minute to let you know that hes gonna be busy and why. You're telling me that he was interested in you but in a week couldn't find the time to send three sentences worth of texts?

I would view this as a huge red flag, personally. His inability to manage his time properly and to communicate is, at best, very worrisome. At worst it's a sign hes really doesn't care much about you at all."
596,"""I'm sorry, that won't work for us.""
Repeat as needed. 

""I'm sorry you feel that way Mom. Let's talk again when you're feeling better.""
Say once before hanging up the phone. 

Do not justify argue defend or explain. she will latch onto anything and try and use it to manipulate. All she needs to hear is no."
597,"I mean...my husband dated one other woman before me when they were in high school (we met when we were 25) and, based on what he's told me, she clearly hurt him, but he has zero hatred towards her or any misgivings. He was also very much over her when we started dating and he's never brought her up unprompted. Having little relationship experience is no excuse to remain this strung up on a previous ex."
598,"I see both sides. While I was growing up, my dad always found excuses to work late,  most nights not coming home until after 8. So we never saw him and my mom hated that he never ate dinner with us or anything. My mom was the reason he wanted to work late, but that's another story lol. 

I am a SAHM and sometimes my hubby has to work late. It's part of life and I understand that and never get mad. But if he was choosing to stay late almost every night instead of coming home to me,  my feelings would be hurt. 

I totally get that this is good for your career and something you want to do. It's awesome you love your job and enjoy working. But if your work is done for the day and you just want to stay late,  I can see how he would be hurt by that. He feels like you are putting your job before him. If this is a serious relationship and you guys plan on being together forever,  he doesn't want the rest of his life to be him coming home and being alone most of the evening. Talk to him and compromise. Maybe two days a week you leave on time,  barring an emergency. Show him that he is important to you too."
599,I say tell the wife sooner than later so if he goes crazy and she wants to avoid it entirely she has a couple days to pack and find a safe place.
600,"Frankly, the storming out of a restaurant 2-3 months in would have been where I walked away. This person has no idea how to communicate like an adult."
601,"As an example of the value conflicts that sandman\_42 speaks of, I don't think I've ever teenager-eye-rolled as hard in my 30's as the last sentence of this:

&gt; I think the big conflict is that *she doesn't see why things should be used as intended*. She's the sort to ask ""why can't the roof be a lounging spot?"" ""Why can't the living room be for hobbies too"" because *she isn't so bothered by the impracticality of all that*. 

I know tons of people who lounge on their roofs - a shingled slanted roof isn't good for it if you weigh more than about 90 pounds, but lots of places have rooftop decks. In fact, in dense urban areas they're more practical than a yard to serve the same function. And some people enjoy the advantages of the height.

And living rooms *are* for hobbies - obviously it depends on the hobby, but until 30 years ago, no one expected a dedicated room for every task, and everyone did everything in whichever room was closest to the right setup. Homework was at the kitchen table, and hobbies were in the den. Sure, newer McMansions are full of single-purpose rooms, but that's really because it helps the buyer justify spending more on a larger space with better profits for the developer. But for a normal person in a 1 bed apartment the question isn't where you're going to do your hobbies - that's going to be the living room or the kitchen because those are the rooms you have -  it's how you're going to store them in the living room when you also use it for so many other things.

&amp;#x200B;

As for hanging out, unless the activity requires a TV, like movies or videogames, people only ever hang out in the kitchen anyway. Get a place with a dining room and get a table that enables hovering and you'll be fine for entertaining. The biggest problem with a couch in the kitchen is that couches are bad for hosting (non-TV things) because no one's facing each other.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Our price range just covers a 1 bedroom apartment with a kitchen, living room, and possibly a dining room, in a nice part of town. 

Have you considered a cheaper part of town, and getting a 2-3 bed or a house? If use of space is a concern, you should probably prioritize more space, or more types of spaces, over neighborhood. If you had a garage then you could also confine her automation to that space, at least during the testing phases. 

You might also have some untested assumptions about what makes a neighborhood or apartment complex nice that are keeping you from having the place you'd actually want. It can't hurt to go looking outside your normal range in any case, even if all it does is enable you &amp; her to converse about what things you're looking for in a space.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think you should go to Ikea - without any particular intention to buy anything - and go look at how they have things organized for small spaces. Ikea specifically has demos of tiny apartments; they're pretty clever and have helped my girlfriend and I compromise on decorating. A bunch of our stuff isn't from Ikea, but we took their ideas and found our own ways to implement them.

They also have things like seats that sit comparable to beanbags, but hide storage or can also function as other furniture when needed, as an example of something that might help stride yalls's two modes. I think if you start looking at how people handle those spaces you'll come away with possible solutions that are more like 70%/70% compromises than just your-way or her-way."
602,"I think you also may be running up against a different set of values. Having grown up without an extended family, you probably got used to holidays with a nuclear family unit. It sounds like he grew up differently. 

I grew up spending holidays with my whole family, and if my SO suggested that we spend any major holiday without at least one of our families (I’m happy to spend them with only his family too) I’d probably be horrified. It would be suggesting that I give up everything comfortable, familiar, and inherent to that holiday. 

However, it’s also totally ok to not want to spend holidays with family! I think you just need to go about it pretty gently, and start with something minor (mother’s day next year, or something like Labour Day May be a great one!). Plan something fun, and try to get your kids and husband excited about it. And remember that you’re not changing a preference, you’re changing a lifetime of tradition and happy memories, so you need to be firm, but kind and understanding."
603,"Let him be mine. You sound like you were a loving and concerned gf who truly cared about his well-being. Unfortunately, he sounds like a clown who has no idea what he wants. Go live your life, find someone who is as driven and passionate as you are."
604,"Next time it happens, record her.

Being sober and seeing yourself acting a drunken asshole is a very humbling experience."
605,Also the best way to lose your passion is by making it your work.   This isn't the case for everyone but it's the case for a lot of people.   I wonder how long OPS boyfriend has been at his dream job.    I know plenty of PTs that hate their jobs too.
606,She's gonna sleep with him when she's at his house.  I guaranteeeee it!
607,"You may not be *able* to address it without hurting/upsetting him.  You aren't in control of how he reacts to things, and if you *try* to control how he reacts, you are robbing him of the opportunity to feel how he needs to feel about things. 

Quite frankly, a 30-year-old who is living with his parents, not because of necessity, but because he blows his entire salary on toys *should* be feeling a bit bad about his life choices.

The only thing you are responsible for is not causing *deliberate* hurt, and you can do that by phrasing things in terms of how you feel:

""[Boyfriend], when you spend money on games instead of saving, I feel [however it makes you feel].  I need us to be making choices that support our plans to have our own place [or whatever it is that you need and want to express], and in order for that to happen, I need you to [whatever you need him to do to support your needs].  Will you do that for me?""

That is not accusatory, it phrases everything in terms of how *you* feel and what *you* need, and it gives him all of the information he requires in order to make informed decisions about his choices in the future.

If phrasing it like that hurts him or gets him upset, 1) there's no way you could have phrased it that would *not* have gotten him hurt or upset, and 2) that's on him, not on you.

Once you have said this, it's up to him to change his habits, or *not* to change his habits.

But I can tell you this: I wouldn't bet a shiny new nickel that I cared about even a *little* bit on the likelihood that a 30-year-old man who lives with his folks and spends all of his money on toys is going to change his ways.  He's been an adult for more than a *decade* and has failed to start acting like one in that time.  As long as his folks are willing to subsidize his permakid status and he can therefore buy all the cool toys he wants, that's where he'll stay."
608,"Oh boy. I've blacked out and made advances toward people I never would while sober. A lot of comments here are saying she remembers. Could be she might have a fuzzy memory of saying something sexual, but isn't sure if the memory is real or not. Maybe that's why she made the comment about making jokes, in case she did say something weird to you.

Blacking out sucks and it's scary to think you might have done/said something mortifying. I think you should treat this as if she really does not remember. Tell her the truth. Then you guys can talk about it. It will probably be awkward and she'll probably be embarrassed. If anything, it'll help her see she needs to be more careful about her drinking."
609,"She's obviously angry at you for deciding to leave, but the echoing of the same insult you said makes me think the way she let it out was kind of just a drunk person thing to say, maybe not the way she would bring it up sober.

But let's be real:  You were ready to end the relationship anyway, for this one comment to push you over the edge.  And why on earth did you just ""decide to move away""?  You did it not because you found a job, since it seems like you found the job afterwards, but because you want a new life.

It's okay to end a relationship because you're just not feeling it anymore.  But have a real talk with her, don't pick some stupid fight and blame her for the breakup.  That's so immature.  Be brave and do the right and decent thing of telling her you're moving on."
610,"Thank you for your advice, I have the support of my family and a lawyer and therapy are my next step x"
611,"So, I'm usually friends with my exes, and I usually tell them we gotta do 90 days no contact and then check in and see how we feel. You both need to take some time apart."
612,"My wife isn't big on therapy. After having a kid she tried weight watchers and loved it. Said the meetings were like group therapy where she didn't have to participate - she just heard others express what she was feeling and the coach/teacher would give great advice. She lost the weight pretty quickly, too."
613,You should report his behavior to CPS.  Your parents will have to make a choice whether they want to continue to foster or avoid contact with him.
614,"Dude, you don't even know if she *does* want to cancel it, or if she was just randomly venting because she was upset people didn't RSVP. 

Stop trying to guess her motives with a bunch of strangers on Reddit, and talk to your sister about whether she really does want to cancel."
615,"If your mother refuses to buy groceries just call child protective services or tell a teacher. They are required to report this. She has problems and needs help. If she is refusing to provide food for a child, it's child abuse.

616,"They were openly flirting in front of you, and she is constantly on his mind if he constantly brings her up. I'd say he's crossed a few lines."
617,Ghosting was justified wtf
618,"Whenever you feel the urge to apologize for something you should ask yourself, “could I thank them instead?”
  
If you want to bring it up at all, I’d thank him for hearing you out and comforting you. Don’t be ashamed or embarrassed for your crying, be grateful for his kindness."
619,I'd ask her to stop and if she keeps commenting I'd pull over and sit. I'd then ask her if she's quite done. Rinse and repeat.
620,"The guys who make the most derisive comments about sex work and the women who do it are the same guys getting caught harassing strippers and drooling over porn stars. Two sides of the same coin - they don’t see you as people. 

Your boyfriend needs to know that his dad is sniffing around you while you’re at work. Judging from your boyfriend’s reaction to his dad’s rudeness, it won’t be the first time dad has been caught doing something shitty. Personal policies of discretion are nice, and understandable, but you also have the right to feel safe and maintain boundaries, and you’ll need your boyfriend on your team when dealing with his creepy dad."
621,"&gt;Why can't the living room be for hobbies too

No offense, but when your budget is ""1 bedroom apartment with a kitchen, living room, and maybe a dining room"", then the living room *is* the most logical space for most hobbies, unless you would rather it be the bedroom. There will need to be compromise on both sides here, but you individually need to realise that if you don't have the money for a place for a spare room, that doesn't mean you get to tell her she can't have her hobbies at all. She also needs to compromise here and realize that since you don't have the budget for a separate workspace, that she needs to scale everything back so it will fit with *your* needs and desires.

It sounds a lot like you guys have different lifestyles which is not ideal for long-term relationships where you are living together. Even if you *did* have the extra space for her to have a separate workshop, it sounds like the way she wants to use the home to socialize, the types of get-togethers she wants to have, are different from the type of socialization you want to have. This isn't necessarily doom to the relationship, but in such a small space, you need to be prepared that the difference in socialization may likely start to grate on one another.

You don't have space to do everything both of you wants, so both of you need to compromise. A normal seating area with a sofa/coffee table/entertainment area in the living room, but the dining area converted to a workshop for example."
622,"I also just want to tack on to this and say, OP, your best self has nothing to do with weight, dress size, etc. Your best self is the self you're most comfortable being, the one you worked hard to become, the one who embodies what you value in a person. Your best self is not something anyone can define in simple terms, let alone a number on a scale."

626,"Bi woman here, with both monog and poly experience.

Most of the men I've dated have made these jokes, because many men fantasize about fmf action. They usually start by joking, then start to discuss the possibility of it actually happening. It gets old in a hurry. Unfortunately it gets to the point where you pretty much expect it and can roll your eyes in advance.

It's bothersome because they're reducing a significant part of your sex life and intimacy into a spectator sport that's about them. Because you can see the pressure for a 3 way coming. Because you get tired of your sexual experiences being used for their spank bank. Because it's reductive. 

There are times it's not tiresome, with people who treat it with more respect, and those are the people you may find yourself willing to open your relationship up with.

But that's just me. YMMV."
627,Maybe she DOES want it. Maybe she was just having a vent on a platform that she knew you wouldn't see and take literally and get offended by. Who knows.
628,My therapist has helped a lot. He tells me to constantly ask myself who I'm living my life for.
629,There’s nothing funny about the fact he performed a penetrative sex act on you without your consent. Thats rape.
630,"The weird thing isn’t asking what happened, it’s when she said she makes a lot of jokes when she’s drunk. To me, that’s her giving away that she knows and trying to brush it off that it was a joke"
631,"She's almost twice your age. If how she introduces you is the concern here, then I think you focusing on the wrong thing."
632,"I don't think there's you should expect your wife to shrug off things like forgetting to pick up your kids. She probably feels sure can't rely on you which must be a huge burden on her, and seems she's acting out accordingly (not sure why she'd think 3 kids is a good idea if she can't handle the stress, but I digress). I also wonder if you act like it's no big deal based on the fact that you call her a perfectionist when these are actually pretty big deals. If it happened rarely, that's one thing, but consistently? 

That being said, it sounds like you have an attention disorder you need to address. See a therapy about possible treatment options, including CBT.

It sounds like she also has a lot of anger and resentment and may need mood stabilizers you during her period. Maybe once you start you can encourage her to also get help (I don't see that will go well current state)"

she's 25. why should she be asked to compromise all her passions for her boyfriend. it does seem to me like he's 'big boy 30' trying to get her to grow up. and he essentially wants her to be a wife 'entertaining guests' with him. but there's no indication of a plan to marry her and really be a grown up.

637,"Whatever you do, don’t sell your house to buy a house with someone you’re not married to or have some similar legal commitment in place especially when he’s so wish washy and word parsing. Just a few months ago, he wasn’t sure he could see a future with you. The fact that he can’t say yes or no is a pretty good indication that it’s a no. He knows if he says no, you’ll bail. If he wanted it, he would have said yes. 

Does he want the same things you want? Marriage and kids? If not, that’s ok, then you both need to find people you share goals with."
638,"Not the person you’re replying to, but what really stood out to me was your lack of communication (which you yourself mention as a problem in your post).

You wanted to use the time apart after you moved to NY to give you both some space and let you both reevaluate the relationship. That sounds like a great idea. Except, then you never directly communicated this to your partner! So when she followed you to NY shortly after, you didn’t get the space you felt you needed. Meanwhile, she felt that *she* was doing the right and difficult thing for your relationship by moving. So this just ends with resentment on both sides, because expectations and feelings were not made clear beforehand.

Similarly, you’ve been feeling for months that your feelings about marrying this woman have changed, and that you’re leaning toward ending the relationship. Yet it sounds like she still thinks this relationship is headed for marriage, and you’re just dragging her feet - which by your own admission, is because you haven’t been explicit enough about your true feelings.

Don’t get it twisted, you *absolutely* should still end this relationship; your GF sounds wildly immature and irresponsible, you’re in different life stages, and your sex life is already completely dead (possibly the worst way to enter a marriage). And you should end it soon, so that your GF has time to process the breakup, (hopefully) work on herself, and then find a new partner in time for her to still have the biological children she wants.

But once you’ve broken up, I would definitely recommend talking with someone at least a bit, to work on your relationship communication skills and habits."
639,"&gt;Any man or woman who respects their partner isn't going to take reckless risks (and yes travelling abroad alone as a woman is definitely a higher risk than going to the local park. Let's not fool ourselves.)

Her solo itinerary is France, Germany, and Austria. Any one of those countries is significantly safer than the US as a whole. Honestly, this is the tamest itinerary I can think of for a solo trip to Europe. His anxieties are his own to deal with. There is absolutely no reason that a woman in her 30's can't travel alone in Western Europe. It's laughable to suggest otherwise."

643,"It's very rare for someone to be in their ""dream"" job. Most jobs have upsides and downsides and for the majority of people the upsides (salary, PTO etc) outweigh the downsides.

647,"She is refusing to stop ""helping"". That is the problem. You have explained to her, ""Your helpful comments make it harder for me to drive and you need to stop them because I do not find them helpful at all."" And she has said, ""no"".

That right there is the Crux of the problem. She didn't say, ""Oh, it bothers you that much? Then I will try and stop, because I don't want you to hate me and I do trust you.""

She just said, ""Too bad, I will cut back but this is what I am going to do.""

Think about your relationship. Has she asked you to stop doing something that you have outright refused to even consider? I would be willing to bet that there is something you used to do that drove her up a tree that you stopped at her request. 

Unless you have explained to her that if she keeps doing that, then you will be doing the other thing that she hates, she may not understand how much you hate her backseat driving. If you have, she may be too self-centered to care.

It's not about shutting up because a man is driving. It's about being distracted by a backseat driver when you should be paying attention to the road. The opposite of ""shutting up because a man is driving"" is the idea that you need to ""shut up because a woman has an opinion"".

This is a partnership. If you aren't compromising and cooperating at making each other comfortable, what the hell are you doing? Apply standards equally. If she can do this thing you hate that is not helpful to YOU but makes her feel better, then you can go back to doing the thing that she hates because it makes you feel better.

Because make no mistake here. She is insisting because it makes her feel better.

Being a passenger, when you are being a driver, sucks. You don't have control of the wheel, and you have to trust the person that does, while having no idea of they see what you see. But the moment you say something, you are pulling their attention from the road, so offering advise is rarely useful unless the person seems distracting. My wife does this because of her anxiety and I despise it. And while her anxiety is not caused by my driving, being a passenger triggers it.

Which is still not an excuse for her distracting me while I am driving. She needs to cope with her feelings, not make them my responsibility to deal with. As a partner, my responsibility is to be supportive of her dealing with her feelings in a healthy way, and that does not include ennabling her to make her feelings my responsibility. Responsibility is like homework in that ""helping"" is not "" doing it for them""."
648,I think I remember hearing somewhere that child support is one of the few things that can follow you to lots of different countries.
649,Sounds like a psychologist would be a better use of money for him tbh
650,"No. Work with your therapist to help resist the guilt tripping. Learn how not to JADE (justify, argue, defend or explain). Giving your mother **any** reasons or excuses allows her to come up with counter arguments and puts you on the defensive."
651,"This needs to be higher. But it's worth mentioning that OP really needs to recognize that just because what he wants is ""normal"" that doesn't make it *correct*. She shouldn't have to compromise more just because he's conventional."
652,"I would be concerned that he views you two as “parts of his life” he can compartmentalize. You’re your own people first, I don’t see any reason you shouldn’t be friends with her. Maybe I’m missing something, but it isn’t really any of his business? Keeping your friendship separate from him sounds like fair game to me."
653,"Could he possibly take a less senior position that would be easier or less stressful?  

I just say this as I did the entrepreneurial thing for a while and of my husband didn't work we would be homeless.   I am now back at a traditional office jobs.  We don't have kids yet but even if we did i would stick with it"
654,I dated a guy once who was always accusing me of stuff like this.  It was infuriating and you did the right thing by dumping her.
655,Sounds familiar. I’ve been stuck in a loop with a narcissist for a year. He has zero empathy towards me. I’m just his supply. OP might look it up because it sounds exactly his his behavior.
656,I feel like I'm missing a major part of this story...
657,"Seriously, break up. He's looking for alternatives and kind of flaunting it, he's trying to exploit your feelings for him and/or any insecurity you may have."
658,"Your husband said it was frowned upon in his culture now. I would still communicate with him that if he wants another wife, that's a dealbreaker for you."
659,"I let a lot of ""little stuff"" like this go when I caught my husband doing them. The last time, it was a year long sexual affair. 

Don't let it go. Be honest about how it happened. Be honest about how it made you feel. You don't want to know how bad it feels when you find out one day, one of those women responded"
660,"Yeah no, that's gaslighting because you showed too much self respect. 

I'm sorry, I don't think this situation will get better. But you deserve better."
661,"She seems to view this in a more logical sense, from my point of view, than you. 

Why can’t these rooms have alternate uses? 

Your answer is simply “because they are meant for other things”. 

You aren’t in the wrong, but you need to give her perspective more credence if you are going to find a true compromise."
662,"Duuuuuude leave this girl asap.. you’re completely justified, do you honestly think this guy has NO intention of being more than a friend to this girl behind your back? at some point you just have to look at it, use common sense as another guy and see whats going on. what do you think they talk about everyday? who flies to another country to meet someone they just met? if i were you dude i’d cut relations with her, but this is all my opinion, see it as you will."
663,I just had an epiphany earlier when I heard him say that. This is not working out and it never will. No matter how I pretend that we are ok.
664,"Your GF sounds really independent and uncomfortable with ceremonies that traditionally involve gift-receiving from others. Was she raised in an environment where asking for help or relying on someone else was a problem?

Sounds to me like more of a pride thing, but you should definitely talk to her about it. There are lots of holidays, events and other rituals your CHILD will likely go through where people will expect to give gifts as part of custom. Will she not throw a 1st bday party for the kid? Will she not accept xmas gifts for the kid, etc? You definitely need to communicate about this and set some expectations around how things like this will be handled. I see a lot of room for compromise here on both your parts.

Growing up of course involves learning how to become more self-reliant, but it also involves learning how to give \*and receive\* graciously. You're absolutely right -- whether you throw a shower or not, people will give you gifts. And it may be that while she doesn't see the appropriateness of a shower right now, AFTER you have the baby she might have a change of heart and want someone to throw her a postpartum shower. They're becoming a lot more common. 

Wedding and birth celebrations are NOT parties thrown to ask people for gifts. (Well, they're not supposed to be, anyway.) They're opportunities for people who you expect to be part of your life as you go through a huge change in your formal family structure to acknowledge that change via a cultural ritual. I don't want to say her opinion about these types of events is unhealthy -- it's not -- but it's mad cynical. I don't think you're being greedy or a bad person for wanting gifts. Babies are EXPENSIVE! People recognize that, especially close friends and family, and want to help out. That's a kind and good thing. It takes a village and all.

Definitely talk to your GF about why she's got such a hard line about this. Set expectations around how gift-giving and -receiving events will be handled in the future and make sure you have a plan for how you'll handle the receipt of gifts you get informally from other people. It may very well be that your GF would be fine with a surprise shower -- lots of options here."
665,Do your relatives know you live together? Because it's literally bonkers to not stay together the night before yet have been for the past 2 years.
666,The worst part is she didn't even wash OP's! She just rooted through the bag for her son's dirty underwear (*urrrrrkkkkk*) and washed those and returned the dirty remainders to OP. Like what. the. fuck.
667,"I mean, yes and no. It's not like there's one Judaism.

Sure, the guys in the fuzzy black hats and boxes tied to their foreheads probably wouldn't let him join for his girlfriend. But depending on where he is, there's probably a Reform Synagogue that would let him join with little fuss.

Source: I used to wear a fuzzy hat and tie little boxes to my forehead."
668,"Bipolar 2 does not justify his actions.  If he was headed for a psychosis there would have been many other signs in the weeks or days before this.  Cheating on your wife isn't a symptom or side effect of bipolar. 
 Unfortunately,  your brother is thinking with what's between his legs rather than what's between his ears."
669,"&gt;It just comes out as I'm genuinely happy that we've done it together. 

This is it right here - it may not be ""her first"" but it is **your first together**. The experience likely isn't the same with you as it was with another person. You and her have still shared a first, for all the first times you've done something together. And that's the valuable thing!"
670,"""I'd want you to have an abortion"" isn't the end of a discussion, it's the start of one. So what happened after he said that? 

Why can't you just say ""I'm glad we talked about this. Although I'm not ready for kids [I'm assuming that, since you have an IUD], I don't think I could get an abortion. So knowing that, what you think about doubling up our contraceptive measures by having you wear condoms?"""
671,"You made the correct choice. Your sister sounds like a piece of shit.

You are an adult. If your family want to have your company they need go treat you well. Otherwise, forget them."
672,"I don't like what I see happening in this thread - you don't need strategies to cope or reduce her side-seat driving. She needs to take a hard break from that habit. And here's why. 

Backseat driving is always bad. Always. It's not just annoying, but also potentially dangerous. 

When you drive, here's your process.
See.
Process.
Do.

When you drive with her, here's your process.
See.
Process.
Listen.
Reprocess.
Respond.
Compare.
Do.

When she's wrong (i.e., when her directions are unhelpful), your reactions are delayed and your focus is divided. 

When she's *right* (i.e., when she noticed something useful that you didn't), *your reactions are delayed and your focus is divided.*

Oh, and, switching between processing what you see and processing what she says to you distracts from observing road conditions. 

In other words, every time she opens her mouth to tell you how to drive, she's increasing the risk to you both. 

I would suggest taking her aside, privately, while not driving, and explaining *this*, with a gentle request to completely, cold-turkey, quit doing *any* sideseat driving whatsover for any reason."
673,I basically ignored him for 7 years and I was completely at peace with it until my grandparents passed away and I reluctantly accepted my dads advances to rekindle a relationship with me but after this weekend I decided that I genuinely don’t want that.
674,It sounds like Liz grew up and you didn’t. It also sounds like you calling her bipolar when you clearly aren’t getting it may be the problem. These aren’t little things. I’m guessing Liz is tired of carrying the load for all of the kids and you. You really need to stop making excuses and come up with other solutions to be more effective and efficient or you will end up divorced because she will reach her limit.
675,"This is a weird post. A 7 month old is not a toddler. It's an infant. A baby this age is only maybe crawling, not yet doing a lot of attention seeking behavior other than crying or banging a spoon on the table. Definitely not trying to pull people's pants down as a joke. Maybe grasping a pant leg out of curiosity, that's it.

There's also not a lot to talk about for a 7 month old. They're still an infant. Other than ""he loves peas"" or ""she's sleeping great"" or ""she's crawling now,"" there's not a lot to say about them. Maybe other parents with babies of similar age would find more to discuss, but not childless friends.


I feel like there is something missing in this story or a lot of exaggeration. It's true that new parents often shift their focus to the baby, which is necessary when the baby is awake and in their care. But for an entire friend group to only talk about a 7 month old when meeting up routinely like this? That sounds highly unusual.

And if you're trying to play a game with an awake 7 month old at the table, that's not going to be efficient. Try naptime or after the baby is sleeping. Babies this age usually go to bed early, like 6-8pm."
676,"Tbh it sounds like he's pressuring her because he wants his own choices to be validated and that her choosing a different path threatens it. 

If that's the case, it's pretty toxic behavior."
677,"My MIL sent a similar text about Mother's Day a few years ago. He was sick, like throwing up every few hours sick, and with 2 children I didn't want it to spread so we kept our distance and just chilled on Mother's Day. He told her that, and she responded with a ""hope you at least text her and tell you appreciate her"".

Ugh

My husband was so upset, felt so bad for him. He thought about it for hours and hours on how to respond and my question back to him was WHY? Do you think she'll change? No. Do you think she'll apologize? No. Do you think you'll feel satisfied with ANY response to her? No.

Then WHY respond? It was hard, I get it, it would take everything in me not to. 

We cut contact with her because of that, was just the tipping point. It's been a nice 2 years without her in our life 😊"
678,"Imo you should have dumped him when it became clear he wasn't trying to find work closer and made you do all of the legwork. It sounds like he has no real interest in putting in work for the relationship, but he certainly does want any perks he can exploit from you.

Dump the whole man, and the only driving you have to do is for yourself."
679,"&gt;She's got a small balcony outside her bedroom, and she's absolutely filled it with plants so that there's no room to sit out there or anything.

Ha ha as soon as I saw the title I knew she was going to be crazy about plants.

That's one fight you're just going to lose SIR

I have advice for your girlfriend...if dude don't like it and you don't want to marry him, why live with him?? 

I ask you the same, if this is not a permanent relationship, why can't y'all just continue to date and live separately? Have fun, come together for sexy times and dates and the occasional overnights, but why should either of you force the other to give up or give in on this...why? 

She's just 25, let her be crazy about plants and wires and whatever the hell she wants. Because living with a man is HARD, off the rip it's going to be a bigger sacrifice for her than you because you'll probably expect her to do most if not all of the cleaning and cooking. So on top of having to pick up after you, she has to give up or severely modify how she wants to live in and decorate her home. For a good husband this is reasonable, for a boyfriend it is not. Nah, not at all.

You want a more traditional home then BE more traditional and make this woman your wife before making husband demands. TF"
680,"Yep, this was my first thought. I feel like a 2br would go really far towards finding a compromise point."
681,"I actually did remove the labels - the bottles are recyclable, so they were separated. I stuck the labels to themselves, and there was some damp stuff in the bag. I know that's not as secure as shredding, but I genuinely never figured these crumpled up labels would be legible in a million years.

As for the other items, they could not have been destroyed, they had to go. I'm actually considering dropping off my garbage elsewhere now because I shouldn't have to be looking up ways to disguise that I have a personal life from garbage pickers."
682,"You’re not being unreasonable for wanting to see him more outside of work, but I totally understand where he’s coming from. 

He’s probably someone that enjoys his alone time and doesn’t always want to be having plans after work."
683,"shit, you've met my aunt???"
684,How would she know if she won’t go to the doctor???? Your parents are really unreasonable.
685,"\&gt; once he snuck a 2-day old burger from Mcdonalds. The tot had diarrhea  

&amp;#x200B;

Someone needs to speak up about this man, an emphatically, before something worse happens. Just think of all the incidents involving this creeper that have probably happened without your having witnessed or heard about it."
686,"Your girlfriend doesn’t sound like a hard line feminist, she sounds like a bully. *She* sounds like a “Chad.” You’re enabling her wreckless behavior every time you step in. Even as an oppressed minority, you don’t get to walk through the streets dishing out whatever social justice you think is fair. 

You need to have a serious talk with her: you’re not her bodyguard. You’re not her protector. You’re her boyfriend. If she were a feminist, she wouldn’t be expecting you to fight the battles she starts. If she’s expecting that, she’s relying on the social constructs she’s supposed to be against. 

People looking for reasons to be offended will find them. She sounds exhausting to be around.

I am curious, what does she actually *do* to make the world a better place?"
687,"This happened to a girl I knew. She dumped her boyfriend, he went crazy, kept saying he was going to kill himself. She took him back so he wouldn't, then he stabbed her to death.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying she's straight up going to kill you, but don't even let her close enough to. Get that restraining order OP!"
688,"He’s vain and has clearly stated that your physically appearance is the most important part of you. He’s already told you how he’d act during pregnancy, and I’m sure he’d react similarly to you aging. Is this the partner you want to grow old with, have children with? How will he treat your kids if they end up being overweight? Or having a physical disability?"
689,"Yep. Or he’ll see baby rolls on his kid and get concerned. Or he’ll be harping on his son to get off the couch....but constantly regardless of how active he is. 

This is someone without real boundaries or empathy when it comes to body image and that’s scary for kids."
690,"So she hid photos of her with you, because she's falling for you. That doesn't really make sense to me... And she's revealed photos with her ex because he hasn't hidden his photos of them together, which she presumably knows because she pays attention to his IG account.

Someone who spends a lot of time managing their social media profile is generally very concerned with how they are perceived. And apparently she doesn't want to be perceived as in a relationship with you. Combine this with the attention she is paying to her ex's accounts, and I can't see that the relationship has much of a future. 

You should be annoyed. Her behaviour is pretty disrespectful. But don't be surprised if she opts to dump you rather than change her social media activity."
691,"Unlike the other person who commented, I actually did read your entire post... and I still agree with them. The success of her career is in no way your responsibility nor do you have any sort of moral obligation to ""confront"" her about her behavior issues.

&gt; it seems fucked up to just cut her off after 5 years of a caring and mostly-good relationship, especially without telling her why.

Most of the time when people say they'll stay friends after a break up, it's bullshit. You even said she's been distant since you two split, so I would hesitate to call you anything other than exes. Don't interfere in her life. She's a 26-year-old woman. If she can't cut it in her field of work, you telling her that almost everyone hate her is NOT going to make her change her ways. It will just make her view you as an enemy."
692,"I would say, cut the coffee shop time down to 7-8 hours instead of 9-10. That will free up 10 hours per week at least. And also reduce your commute time (you're currently walking 10 hours per week, when you could instead bike for 2-3 hours per week), that would free up another 7-8 hours. Just by making these simple adjustments you can suddenly have 18 more free hours per week. That's enough to pick up a new hobby, meet new people, etc. And you'll get in great cardio shape if you start biking. 

I think you should also consider trying not to be so rigid. You're a student, that means you don't have to work 9-5 M-F like so many other people. You have opportunities they don't have. You can take day trips, go to random museums or galleries in the middle of the day, go to the gym when no one else is there so you have all the machines to yourself, etc. It's great that you love coffee shops but they aren't the only in life that could make you happy. You could enjoy other things, but you won't know until you try."
693,"That too, definitely that too. The point being that it's easy to find many reasons for the physiologist to be with his wife despite OP's husband being an utter moron about the idea."
694,"If you have broken up multiple times over something so trivial and had to beg to get back together, do you honestly think it’s worth it? 

Dude can’t handle that you’re friends with someone on FB. Do you really want to continue this silly cycle of breaking up and getting back together because he doesn’t like your social media interactions?"
695,"This. Anytime I've had a significant other who does this I've said ""do you want to drive? I'll pull over."" Or ""you're welcome to walk if you don't like my driving. I'll pull over."" It's pretty much the most direct route short of ""stop backseat driving."""
696,"I'm not sure if I would be comfortable with changing my Facebook picture to accommodate your needs. Since he's only eight months in it, I probably wouldn't. But that's just me; I hardly use Facebook and haven't changed my profile picture in years. I just wouldn't feel like 'bothering' my connections with something like that. How small the effort (or 'burden') may seem for you. 

That said, this seems to be about caring and showing interest in what you are involved in. That's a totally different story! Right now, I'm even curious to know more about the current situation in Sudan and I don't even know you! Also the fact that he was very impolite in not even wanting to see your finished Python project was very inconsiderate. Tell him you need him to understand why the situation in Sudan is so important for you AND why it is so incredibly important for you that you are able to talk about these things with him. You need him in this! Hopefully he will put in a little more effort just to show you he does care about you and what keeps you busy."
697,"&gt;Am I overreacting/over thinking?

Yes.

Judge him by his actions, not one reddit comment you found 9 months ago.

Does his commitment in words that he's said to you match his commitment in actions in this relationship? If the answer is yes then you have nothing to worry about. If the answer is no, I'd be curious to know in what ways you've noticed this."
698,"&gt;What do you think?

I think that he is testing whether you're a pushover and whether he can boss you around arbitrarily.

&gt; Am I being taken advantage of? 

Yes."
699,"Yeah, also the ""selfish"" part ffs. So traveling alone as a woman is dangerous because (I'm guessing here) you might get raped, and it's selfish to risk getting raped but only if you have a boyfriend. OP, dump this flaming piece of trash."
700,And stop asking if she’s been somewhere before since OP is only asking disrupt the relationship!
701,"I know this is going to be hard to hear but....

You are part of the reason your childhood grudges are continuing.  You are taking this tweet WAY too personally.  It isn't even about you, it's about significant people not showing up.  

Did you want to throw your sister a baby shower or not?  Were you only doing it to get praise from her and approval from her?  That's not a good reason.  If you are spending too much money and time on the shower, that's on YOU.  

Honestly, if you cared at all about your sister you would be asking her about her being sad about her friends not coming and trying to cheer her up about that.  Instead you are only focused on yourself."
702,"If this was anything else it would be bad too. If you were spending 50 hours a week on archery/golf/video games at the expense of a relationship, most people would have an issue."
703,"She has a vacation that is about 6 weeks (from next week til the beginning of August) long and 60% of it is spending time with her boyfriend in Italy. So her solo trip is 2,5 weeks tops and she'll be visiting friends. So it's not leaving backpacking for months. I'd be okay with my husband going away for 2,5 weeks."
704,"Reading this was like reading a choose your own adventure where the outcomes are really obvious at every step and someone KEEPS taking the worst option.

You missed your flight? Oh well, go home. You said you can't afford to spend any money.

Her car won't start? Wasn't meant to be.

She offers you a weed cookie? This is a stressful situation that requires being alert, probably not the best time to get stoned.

An activity requires a credit card? Don't do that activity, check beforehand to make sure she is able to pay for any activity you do.

She's about to pay $500 for a timeshare? ""Hey, you owe me money so I need you to pay me back before you pay for anything else.""

You don't want to stay in the timeshare meeting? Leave.

She doesn't want to do your must-do activities? Go by yourself.

She's taking a bath? LEAVE HER AT THE HOTEL. I genuinely cannot BELIEVE after all this nonsense you waited for her and missed your flight AGAIN. Why???

&gt; Beth doesn't remember where we parked

This one is kind of disingenuous to put on her, it was your car so why was it her responsibility to remember where it was parked? Even if you were stoned at that point, your fiance was there too.

There were so many times you could have made other decisions and while Beth sucks, someone can't take advantage of you if you're refusing to let them. You need to start enforcing better boundaries."
705,"Agree here, I reject the idea that liz could be more easy going.. OP identifies a couple of practical examples (a house without a washing machine with kids is.. bad and countertops are so so expensive and long term and it’s shit to pay for something and not get it because of carelessness).

I think that ultimately liz is likely frustrated and exhausted by a daily series of letdowns. Which may be small but certainly add up to a life in which she shoulders most of the domestic responsibilities and in return, her husband mopes about being shit.

OP, it’s time to take responsibility here. Forgetful people need systems. I don’t hear you saying my double check failsafe didn’t work or my diary didn’t sync up and my backup paper diary wasn’t up to date.. I hear you say “I forget stuff” and it’s just not good enough. I have MMMADDDD dyslexia so I get jumbled and lost but I’ve taken the time to develop systems that work for me and it’s made life better for people around me. 

In terms of the romance stuff, shit son. Google “free dates” and start there. The world over are couples financially struggling. She might benefit from small tokens of love as well (say you’ll do the dishes and Run her a bath while you get them done) 

Your self esteem sounds bashed. You might want to chat to someone about that. But make no mistake, you are the one here who needs to do the heavy lifting to improve things. So do what you gotta do to get into an action frame of mind and move from there.

You don’t sound like a bad guy, but ... you could be a better partner. Best of luck!"
706,"Forget about being nice, sometimes you can't be 'nice' (as in, not upset someone).

Basically just slowly ghost him/fade away, and he'll get the hint."
707,"I agree. As a former young man myself, the idea of a woman who ""needs"" you is kind of fun for a while. Like you get to feel like the classic man in the relationship. It's only once you get older do you realize that by doing all of her stuff *and* all of your stuff that a high-maintenance woman isn't nearly as fun as it once was.

711,"Clearly there is currently a lot more negative press towards the Middle East (which the average person associates with Arabs and Muslims) than India. Internalized racism is totally a thing. There are Jewish people who sympathize with neo-Nazis, African Americans who will put down ‘black culture’, and people from Mexico who want no one else to cross the border like they themselves just did. People don’t want to be associated with negative things even if the negative thing is a stereotype about their own ancestry. It turns into a, “cant beat them, might as well join them” mindset. Feeding into prejudice is often ‘easier’ than doing the hard work of coming to terms with diversity or challenging stereotypes. 


I’m sorry you are dealing with this. If you haven’t seen them in 8 years I could just tend to stay out of it. Hearing things from you is far more likely to just cause them to dig in deeper."

718,"Ok, with narcissistic people like your mother, there is absolutely nothing you can say to her about your sister that will improve the situation, because your mother will find a way to twist or ruin whatever you come up with, and she will not agree to get help, because she is perfect and you and everyone else is wrong and at fault. 

So ... don’t let her ruin your wedding. Your sister had the right idea leaving Mommie Dearest off the guest list and you may want to do the same or at least have one of your bridesmaids or someone else be in charge of keeping your mother away from you and out of trouble (or better yet, a bouncer to toss her out there if she acts up). 


See /r/raisedbynarcissists and /r/justnomil for additional support and techniques."
719,"Um, the brother is literally putting in his sister's phone number to have the receipts emailed to. It's pretty justified why he has access to the information. Because the brother is an idiot."
720,"He said women in relationship shouldn't travel alone because it's reckless, SELFISH AND ASKING FOR IT. In other words that charmer isn't afraid his gf could get harmed, he is afraid someone will ruin his property with rape (selfish, ffs!). That is a red flag size of small planet."
721,"Not really,  he'd have a gap in his resume and her business and their family will eat up any savings"
722,"&gt;I've never felt more alone... I've started to give up on life or living.

You're placing too much responsibility on your GF and her children to solve your social isolation. It's up to YOU to sort out these feelings of depression and anxiety. Go see a therapist on your own. Don't wait for her to come along to couples therapy, YOU need to get yourself sorted out first."
723,"Because sometimes you join your partner when they go to weddings, even though they're not weddings of people you know?

I don't see anything weird with joining your girlfriend to a wedding of a friend of hers."
724,"I mean you’re right to an extent but i think you’re not really understanding that a 7mo old is not at all a toddler...definitely still an infant that needs a ton of care and yes most parents are going to drop everything they do and pay attention to baby. 

I hear where you’re coming from but your best bet is to spend less time around this baby. Many people enjoy being around them and think it’s fun to interact with them this way, it’s not likely to stop. Like the top comment says, you should initiate some smaller group gatherings that don’t include dad/baby."
725,"I mean, there's not much you can do about it in the end. This is essentially the adult version of the child who covers his ears and says ""tra la la la I'm not listening."" With the child, imagining that it's your son or daughter, you can discipline him/her. But what to do with an adult?

You have to draw a line in the sand. There comes a point where you decide, ""this is it, this is my limit, and I will accept no less than this.""  And you really don't. If the person does not respect those limits, he will have to bear the consequences. What are the consequences? This is for you to decide depending on the context.

In the case of OP's problem for example, you can simply start refusing to do any extra favours until the other person agrees to discuss the issue and recognise what is happening. Obviously, this will cause more fights and more tension in the relationship - but that's exactly the point. If the relationship is really good deep down, it should be able to survive this tension and these fights. If, however, the other person creates such resistance to the point of ""breaking"" everything... Then this relationship really had no future. 

Either two people talk and reach a consensus, or if the conversation is really impossible, that relationship isn't healthy. Relationships only survive if there is respect and concern for the other's opinion. When this doesn't exist, it's a sign that the foundations are eroded. And of so, no structure can stand."
726,This script is perfect
727,Do not confront her! Talk to a lawyer first and seek their professional guidance. You want the best possible outcome for you and your children when things go south.
728,"Your bf is verbally abusive and you need to leave ASAP

Beyond that, I get a very strong impression that you have a habit of surounding yourself with toxic and abusive people. Basic gist is because you grew up in an emotionally toxic environment, you've become accustomed to having to ""work"" for people's affections. Do you feel suspicious if someone gives love and respect to you too freely? Or feel more attracted to a person (romantically or otherwise) who's cruel or emotionally unavailable to you?

What flagged this in your post was that out of 4 other people you mentioned in your post, at least 3 of them were abusive towards you (your bf and mom obviously, but your friend ""freaking out at you"" for not being able to afford fancy spa things is really not OK either). Yet you describe ""forgiving"" your bf despite the fact that he repeats the same horrible shit over and over with no indication of change. You're still in contact w your horribly abusive mom and haven't arranged any boundaries that would seem to stop her texting you the most vile shit a semi routine occurrence. And while it might not have been relevant to the post to mention if you did I'll bet you didn't stand up for yourself or cut out the ""friend"" who flipped at you for not shelling out for that expensive trip.

If this is resonating with you you really need to address it with yourself, otherwise you'll continue to surround yourself with terrible, abusive people and even if you leave one, you'll just find more of them. First, I'd strongly advice that you **don't enter into another romantic relationship until you sort this stuff out.** Second and most obvious suggestion is individual therapy with someone who specializes in childhood trauma and resulting attachment issues. Third I'm lifting directly from a blog post by Sam Dylan Finch: go through your contacts and look for the friends and acquaintances who you like, but distance yourself from - the ones who give their love/respect so freely it makes you uncomfortable. Reach out to them, even if you're not that close now, and make a concerted effort to make more space for them in your lives. Relearning how to have healthy relationships after such a truly awful upbringing is really hard work, but it is possible and I wish you the best of luck."
729,This 1000%!!! Don’t ever be anyone’s frozen pizza!!
730,He works in corporate finance so there aren’t a lot of freelance or part time jobs. He also hates the work. I’m worried about the same thing - I don’t want to be in a difficult situation in two years... maybe a year off will be safer
731,"I think the point of the comment is that you explained that going to the cafe feels semi-social and gets you out of the house. But if you prefer it over doing something with someone you're dating (social and out of the house), there may be another factor we're not seeing here."
732,"This covers it.

Right and wrong are in the bin at this point. You hit each other. 'Justification' for hitting each other is moot.

This is no good. Leave."
733,"So you are pinning all your hopes on him miraculously becoming a different person one day? He’s selfish, inconsiderate, a liar and hides your relationship so he can pursue other women. Why would you ever consider this marriage material?"
734,So you'll only reply to the comment that validates your feelings? Sometimes I don't get why people even post here
735,"It’s ok to change your mind, and not talk to him. It’s also ok to mourn the loss of your relationship - it sounds like leaving was the right thing to do, but that doesn’t magically make the process pain-free for you."
736,"&gt; What I want is to make him hurt the way that I hurt.

To be perfectly honest, somebody that hurt you the way he did likely isn't capable of feeling similar things. He sounds like a narcissistic and sociopathic moron, which also means he probably doesn't feel emotional pain the same way. The best revenge you can get is to maximize your potential moving forward and become the best person you can be. Improve your life, get therapy, advance in your career, grow as a person... his karma will come."
737,thats fucking nuts you can have a two pound gain from eating too much salt the day before
738,"A little lesson I (32F) wish I had learned when I was your age. You can be assertive and still be nice, but most importantly: *you do not need to be nice*

If he is creeping you out, let him know. ""Hey dude, you are being clingy and its bothering me. I'm not glued to my phone so please give me space.""

If that doesn't work just come out and say don't contact me again and block him. Hell, you don't even have to say anything, you can just block him and go on with your life. 

Being nice and being lady like is not more important than your safety, than your feelings and is definitely not more important than his feelings."
739,"She panics when your phone is off because she knows why *her* phone is off when she is with you.

She is going to keep you from moving on with your life until she doesn't need you anymore and will ghost you once that happens. Would you want a relationship with a new girl who is hanging on to an ex? Neither will her next SO.

Cut ties, find someone who wants you back the way you want them."
740,"&gt; and since we both love Alien we have a big ol' IN SPACE NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU SCREAM poster with the egg above the couch.

This is so lovely!! One of my exes said that he wouldn't want my Alien posters hanged in the house.

My current boyfriend helped me hang them AND he got a Weyland Yutani T-shirt today to join me in my crazy obsession."
741,"Sometimes in a realtionship, you just have to be a little dickish. My wife has used this line on me in the past and i was perfectly okay with it.     ""*I have something I need to say, but it's a little weird and hard to talk about, so please understand I'm just trying to be helpful love...*"" Pause

And then tell him."
742,"Emptying out your savings to do this is extremely
dumb. No nice way to put this.

Your side business is a side business. The sensical thing to do is for you to put all your energy into this side business WHILE your husband works full time. 

Your kids are super young. Your husband leaving the job force this early is going to screw you. If your business doesn’t take off, how are you going to sustain your entire family? It’s not about the savings either. Think about retirement plans, think about how you would even BEGIN to rebuild those savings, kids college funds, etc. 

Honestly you’re financially screwing yourselves. Choosing this path looks fun and swell short term. It is extremely short sighted. Long term will not be fun for either of you."
743,"Because in the vast majority of cases it is. There are *very* few people who actually do thrive from a near total lack of interaction with others. Most of the time, it's a symptom of deep depression or work addiction, not contentment.

And in most of those very rare cases, the person in question is also apathetic towards romance, which you are not. 

It also harms your ability to interact with people. Social interaction is a skill like any other, and the less of it you do, the more that skill rusts, just like any other."
744,"Ummm, you sound amazing and I will physically fight anyone who insults your body."
745,Report to the police to trace him. Contact your family and friends for immediate support
746,i know this deep down but i think i have this bad habit of caring about other people’s feelings more than my own. i need to live by this though.
747,She doesn't want to be judged or have people know about you...how is there a future for you then?
748,I would be pretty annoyed if my husband stayed late at work 4 nights a week to help co-workers finish their job. I think knowing you're prioritizing them over your SO probably makes the feeling of lonliness way worse.
749,"&gt;A 39-year-old who can’t say “I love you” after TWO YEARS?!? I think you’d be smart to call it quits and stop wasting your youth on this guy.

no kidding OP! I thought waiting like 6 months was torture. You are incredible! Id get out of there."
750,"I'd respect your girlfriend here OP.  She doesn't want a baby shower so don't ask or try to surprise her with one.

The gifts and money will come regardless, and I don't think anybody giving them expects a party out of it.  

If you guys need help with buying baby things, then mention it if anybody asks how they can help.  Otherwise can I suggest you take a look at facebook marketplace? A lot of baby clothes barely gets used before a baby out grows it, ditto various gear you need for a baby.  So it can be bought almost (if not completely) new for very, very cheap at consignment stores or online at places like facebook marketplace or gumtree."
751,"If I had to bet, I'd say he will pretend like it never happened until you say something. He'll leave it up to you if you want to talk any more about it, or even acknowledge it at all. It's important to recognize who we can turn to when we just need to let it all out, and this man seems like one of them for you; he responded with compassion and empathy for you, I 100% guarantee he doesn't think ANY less of you - he probably gained some respect for you tbh. I had a (sort of) similar experience with one of my friends dad's, and neither of us ever mentioned it again. And I'm still so grateful for the way he handled that situation, like 8 years later. Don't sweat it man, and stay strong. You got this."
752,"To be completely honest, if you’re not ready to move in then you need to move out. I get you have issues with your place but it’s a bit unfair to tell her you’re not ready to move in when you are indeed living with her already. Groceries are a nice gesture but that’s not really going to help much when you’re also eating the food.

I don’t think you should move in with her at the moment due to her financial situation alone, but you certainly need to move out and go back to your own place. Or somewhere that isn’t living with her."
753,"You shouldn't even be dating this jerkbaby, let alone ""paying him back""."
754,"Good news: you don't have to pay for fraudulent card use if you report it as such.

Bad news: your wife will have a criminal record.

Honestly? She's a thief."
755,I’m guessing the biggest problem is that there’s a certain level of trust that feels broken. I’d recommend therapy for the couple to try and figure things out.
