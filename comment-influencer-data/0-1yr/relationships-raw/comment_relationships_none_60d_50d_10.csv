0,Last time my friends and I were walking around that part of San Francisco at 3 am we were all on drugs and looking for more drugs.
1,"I dated a hardcore Southern Baptist for awhile while living in SC. I was raised in Washington state. I too thought I’d be fine in the relationship, because his beliefs didn’t bother me (raised Lutheran and I stopped going to church at like 11). The problem is your beliefs will bother him to no end. That stressor in the relationship really takes a toll on both people. 

You don’t need to explain or give a reason for kids. If you want them now, you’re not going to change your mind in your 30s, trust me. Definite deal breaker.

I’d give him some time to process everything, you did hit him with this last night. I’m sure the kid part was a surprise for you as well. Based on this post you know what the right choice is, this is all very logical, it just sucks."
2,"&gt; Edit: I want to add that he's been a little insecure that we both had the same amount of sex partners prior to getting together (2). Both of his were long term relationships. 1 of mine was long term, and my other one was a 4ish month relationship that I thought was going to be long term. My husband and I met about 2 months after that last relationship and he's always resented my sexual history. 

Sister, why would you accept such an absurd double-standard? Also, why is he logging into your Facebook? This guy honestly seems like bad news, and the best outcome for you is probably not being in a relationship with him anymore."
3,"It’s not sustainable and it doesn’t make you a jerk. 

Be direct but kind. She doesnt have to know it’s physical. 

“We have a great connection, and I mistook that for romantic chemistry. That just isn’t there for me; I feel close to you and I have an amazing time with you, but the bf/gf chemistry isn’t there for me. I would love to be friends but I understand if you want space.”"
4,"My sister’s (ex) boyfriend refused to meet up when he sensed that she was about to end things. She said she wanted to talk so he started basically ghosting her. Kept coming up with excuses or not responding when she asked to meet up. 

She then asked if she could call him (to break up with him over the phone since he refused to meet up) and he said no. So she texted it to him. Sometimes a breakup text is necessary when the other is not responsive. Better to end it that way than drag it out. You shouldn’t feel bad for sending a breakup text in this context."
5,"Are you sure it was just social anxiety? The way her family was acting seemed like she was suicidal or something. I wouldn't say cut her off or anything but in the future, just don't depend on her because it seems like she's going through a lot right now. I do think that you are valid for being upset though but tell her that won't really make anything better."
6,Who the hell wants to eat dinner at 10:00 pm then be up to be at work at 8:00 the next morning? All to what? Save a couple of dollars? It’s a freaken pizza. They aren’t expensive anyway!
7,I once got lost in boyfriends closet while trying to find the bathroom. Getting lost in the house while drunk is definitely a thing.
8,"Band Practice in 45 minutes...and they want to go get lunch afterward? What kind of priority is that? In a normal situation where he wasn't already in trouble, I would say that getting angry but waiting till evening would be fine. But he already knows he's in hot water. And if Sunday was his band mate's birthday he shouldn't known AT THE VERY FREAKIN' LEAST the day before that this would happen. And if that was important then he'd do everything he could to wake up earlier if he knows what Band Practice time is.  
You're justified. Worry not."
9,"&gt; I message him after breakfast about being out all night and he says he needed to take a walk. Says no cheating happened.

So you asked him, ""hey, how come you were out all night,"" and his answer was ""I just went for a walk, I didn't cheat on you""?

He cheated on you."
10,"Your husband invaded your privacy, dredged up stuff from nearly a decade ago, interrupted yourcalled you a slut and a liar and is so immature that he is actually upset about a sexual history similar to his own. I suggest reading Why does he do that? by Lundy Bancroft before talking to him; you might gain some knowledge about the type of person your husband is, and how best to deal with him."
11,Hahaha what was his end game there? Of I avoid the conversation long enough she will forgot to break up with me?
12,"Be done. He rescheduled twice, the second time *knowing that he had prior commitments*. Once is possible, but twice when he deliberately picks a day when other things are on, that's just being ridiculous about it. You can't take him seriously, saying that he's not deprioritizing things when he's doing exactly that. Truth is in actions and not words.

He can avoid meeting you in person, sure. Excuses and delays are easy. He can't avoid that final text if you send it."
13,"She’s so sick that she’s on medical leave from work, so I’m not sure what you were expecting here.  Someone who is that sick (for any reason) shouldn’t really be taking on additional responsibilities."
14,"Yeah, what the fuck is he doing logging into your Facebook at 4am?"
15,"Red flag #1) He logs into YOUR Facebook and reads your messages.

Red flag #2) He gets mad at you for these messages that were BEFORE you even met.

Red flag #3) He's mad because you had the same number of sexual partners which isn't a lot in any way, shape or form.

In my honest opinion, I think YOU should be the one to divorce HIM. He's judging you for bullshit, misogynistic reasons. He does NOT sound like a keeper. Get out while you're still young."
16,"My bf is a multi alarm person, whereas I only use one to get up. We used to have the issue of him waking me up with his alarms as well, I don’t fall asleep as easily as him.

What he’s started doing is setting multiple alarms, but after the first one, he’ll get up and go sleep on the couch and hit the snooze multiple times. 
This way he’s not keeping me up with the sound and he can fall back asleep if he wants."
17,"He is actually still asleep right now. So I don't know what his behavior is going to be like when he wakes up. His mother called again and my parents called to see if I was safe. He's a heavy sleeper so I've packed all my stuff at night in order to fly back home. I also hid his guns just in case he gets angry when he finds out I've packed. He's a reasonable person while sober, but you never know.

Thank you for you kind words ❤️"
18,"Your post states she has been on medical leave for four months. That is pretty serious. I am betting that she has more than social anxiety - either something undiagnosed and/or something that she has not disclosed to you.

I understand that you also consider mental health as a real, genuine illness, however, it's not like taking antibiotics and getting over the flu. Patients are known to try many different medications before they settle onto something that helps them. The side effects of some of the medications are not fun at all. Some of them increase suicidal tendencies. Some of them kill your appetite. Some of them increase your appetite. I'm not sure about all of them, but some of them don't work instantly - they take 4-6 weeks before you can notice anything. 

Maybe she had a mental breakdown about how she may have been a bad friend to you and not organising the scavenger hunt which sent her in a downward spiral. Who knows.

You're not at fault, in my opinion, but neither she is. Mental health issues SUCK. You feel paralysed and trapped. You belittle yourself. You stare in the mirror and talk down on yourself. You look in the mirror and hate yourself for not picking yourself up and just going to the (your) wedding. 

Either way, you're at a crossroad here. You'll need to make a decision to forgive and forget or part ways. If you do decide to forgive and forget, you will need to work out how to let go of any anger and/or resentment you hold towards how she behaved during your wedding. I think you'll need to maybe talk to her mother or boyfriend, someone and see what really went down. Tell them you are concerned for her. If you decide to part ways, you will need to think about how to do it gently as you don't want it to start another series of mental health issues."
19,"Hey, another commenter that's been there done that. Dated a guy (29) when I was 18. Lo and behold it was NOT a healthy relationship. He was incredibly immature, albeit sweet, and I was a teenager. I don't regret it because it was a learning experience, but I do not recommend. Plus it sucked to be so ashamed to introduce someone with a significant age gap when you're so young."
20,What you do is dump his jealous insane ass.
21,"First of all, I’m sorry you’re going through this.  The person you thought you were marrying has morphed into someone else, either because he’s changed or because of the booze or both.

After the incident you describe, how was he when he sobered up? Did he remember what happened? Was he contrite and apologetic? 

You should 100% postpone the wedding.  He needs to admit he has a problem and actually seek help to solve it.  If he doesn’t, you need to walk away, as painful as that will be.

I’m not familiar with the resources the military provides for substance abuse treatment (and what the implications of seeking out those services would be) , so others will have to comment there.

Just know that you’re going to be ok no matter what happens."
22,"&gt; He has a major history of being dishonest. Has history of lies

Yeah... this is why you don't have kids with someone you can't trust."
23,"&gt;You're going to have to talk to him about it

This should be pinned at the top of every post and there shouldn't be any other advice needed until this step is done."
24,"Okay. 

She is mentally ill so no, she was not able to be at your wedding, even though she may have wanted to more than anything. Unfortunately it is not something she can just muscle through. So she is not at fault. 

But neither are you. 

There is nothing that says that you need to always have to be the understanding one, and you are also allowed to practice self care and say “I can’t keep putting myself out there for you. I love you, but I need to care for myself too”. 

It sucks, but it happens."
25,"I think this is a great way of putting it. There’s no need to destroy her confidence by outright saying you’re not physically attracted to her, because down the line, someone eventually will be! But it’s not you, and you’ve given it plenty of time for the attraction to grow and it hasn’t."
26,"Its time to D-D-D-D-D-D-ump him.
  
Soliciting nudes is cheating."
27,"&gt;  then he pushed me hard enough to make me stumbled for a bit. I know it's not abuse

Um...YES IT IS. He put his hands on you in anger. That's the literal definition of abuse. Just because he didn't push you down a flight of stairs doesn't mean it's not abuse, and now that it's started it will escalate.

Do you have any family or friends in your area you could stay with temporarily? I know if you were a friend of mine and you told me what was happening, I would be happy to house you while you figure out next steps. Are there social services in your area? Do you have resources for people in your industry who can look at your resume for you if you've had a hard time getting decent work? I'm sure there are people on Reddit who will do that.

I'm sorry you're in this situation, and your priority should be getting away from this man when you are able. Check out r/frugal as well for ways to save as much as you can as quickly as you can. Good luck, I hope things get better, truly."
28,"Anger and high intelligence aren't linked, he's just an asshole. You're in an emotionally and verbally abusive relationship. Ask yourself, do you want your child growing up to think this is normal and either behave that way to their future partners or accept this kind of abuse themself? 

You don't have to live like this. You don't have to walk on eggshells and take being constantly berated. You don't have to make excuses for him (he doesn't hate women or anything, he's just verbally abusive). Verbal abuse is domestic violence. Your child is being exposed to it and it's becoming normalized.

If he's a good parent, fine, split up and split custody. But couples' counseling won't help, it gives an abusive partner more ammunition to use against you and more ways to hurt you. I've been down that road and trust me *it does not work.* It just makes things worse.

The hardest part will be deciding to leave, but you can do it. And you'll feel like a huge weight has been lifted off you when you do. Your child will be better off going between two homes than witnessing this toxicity. 

You may feel you can't get out but you can. Reach out to a local women's shelter or domestic violence shelter for resources, they will have much you can avail yourself of, including support groups, housing, safety planning."
29,If she is taking 4 MONTHS off of work — i.e. 1/3 of the year — it’s definitely more severe than social anxiety or (imho) depression.
30,"They have been together since they were 16 and 15, so it's important to bear in mind that this relationship has zero frame of reference for what is and isn't healthy. (It's not BTW).

Not putting it on your parents or anything but why were they entertaining some teenage girl telling them where their son could eat at a restaurant or go on vacation? It seems her unacceptable actions have gone unchecked by your broader family (and possibly her own), hence why she thinks she can act how she wants. 

You are not obliged to have a relationship with her by any means, and frankly - why would you want to? I would suggest, advising your family 1st that this is something you are planning to do, to sense if they will support you. 

Be prepared that they may not, given that they haven't called her out over the years. Then you need to decide are you willing to stick your neck out and do what's right for you."
31,"Could be overwhelming fear of confrontation/anxiety issues. Same reason a lot of people procrastinate. It sounds lazy or apathetic, but it's rooted in fear."
32,"Personally, I’ve been there and I wouldn’t do it again. My ex and I were also 8 years apart. It was rocky (he was abusive, common in large age gaps when younger) and often used my “inexperience” against me. Lots of comments like, “trust me, I have more experience than you”. 

Enjoy being 18. You only get to do it once. Tell him you’d rather just be friends. If he’s a decent guy, he’ll understand. If he gets mean/nasty, we’ll then you’ve seen that other side of him and then know who you’re dealing with.

I don’t think healthy, adjusted 26 year olds are chasing after 18 year olds. You two are in very different parts of life."
33,This is kind of getting to another issue I think. T and her mom will kind of undersell T's condition a bit which I think leads to T not getting the correct treatment for her issues.
34,"You're being cheated on. Send him a screenshot of her story, and send her pictures of the two of you. Ruin their holiday and then end it with this jerk."
35,"When I was 15-18, I dated a guy 7 years older than myself. He also pursued me until I ""gave in."" Why would you want to date someone who doesn't even respect your most basic boundary of not wanting to date? I ask myself why I gave in all the time, and I really wish I hadn't."
36,"You're not more mature for your age, it's just a classic line from older creeps to make you feel special. The reality is that he's immature or crazy for his age, and your lack of experience doesn't let you see that.

If he was worth dating, he wouldn't be hitting on a teenager."
37,"I was gonna say the last time I was in San Francisco for work I wandered around for a few hours at night and took a cab for inexplicable reasons somewhere.

I think we were procuring board games and rum for Anonymous.

Can’t be too sure.  I was really really high."
38,"Holy... that line about “only you would be bothered” is some MAJOR gaslighting! ANYONE would be furious! This man not only lied at the beginning of the relationship but *consistently* for 2.5 years, even when explicitly asked if he was married to her. And he can’t even come up with a good reason for the lie!!!

Please leave. Holy shit. This is the kinda man that’d lose his job and take out a second mortgage and get hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt without telling you a damn thing. He could ruin your life with his lies!"
39,"Sweetheart, you are about to learn a horrible lesson in why you should never, EVER be the Cool Girlfriend.

Those two are about to start an affair, and they are counting on you to work overtime trying to be tolerant and understanding of all the ""questionable closeness"" they are developing:  they won't even have to hide much because you're going to pull the wool over your own eyes.

It's just what Cool Girlfriends do, and I'm afraid that it's going to be a ghastly shock when you realize that being Cool doesn't actually give you any control over the situation or protect you from emotional harm.

If/when Katie and your bf hook up, it won't be because you were jealous or ""controlling"" or insufficiently ""understanding.""  They will fuck because they want to fuck.

That's it.

There's nothing you can do except voice your concerns and start thinking about an exit.  I don't think Katie qualifies as a friend anymore and at minimum you might think about moving elsewhere.  As for your bf...well, you'll have to decide how much anxiety he's worth.

Remember:  having a bf-shaped human in your life is not a substitute for self-esteem and self-respect."
40,"He has a history of visiting prostitutes? And a gambling addiction? And took a cab to take a walk? And lies to you all the time? Even if he didn’t cheat, he did *something* he doesn’t want you to know and didn’t have enough time to come up with a good excuse before you asked about it."
41,"The $2,000 for a first birthday party was for her, not the toddler. She needs some reality checks."
42,"“Thanks for the birthday wishes, grandma! Love you!” 

It’ll drive her nuts AND make you look like a saint. It’s a win-win. People like grandma are not entitled to a response that takes them seriously, and it’s not like she has any say whatsoever in your life choices anyway. If you want to maintain a relationship with her, learn the art of going selectively deaf. It’ll save your sanity."
43,"&gt;Of course I feel guilty and ashamed now,

Why? I mean obviously because he's sl\*t-shaming you and stating you should feel bad, but sending it's okay for women, even teen women, to have sex drives and talk sexually and send sexy messages. All of those things are okay! You shouldn't have to feel ashamed for being a young person, exploring your own sexuality!!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He feels lied to, which I can understand because I never told him about these instances.

why would you have? It's ridiculous, Are you guys in some sort of purity culture? Does he have a hang up about you having been a virgin or pure when he met you? Is this some Christian thing?

&amp;#x200B;

He's being terrible. Some Facebook messages you sent as a teenager are none of his business and he's being incredibly judgmental and paternalistic."
44,"If this was a romantic and not platonic relationship everyone would be telling you to dump her and move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

You guys want different things. that is not going to change"
45,"It *is*, however, a teenaged edgelord position, and it sounds like this kid is leaning into that *hard*."
46,Time to insist you meet and air this to him. Explain how you feel and if he's a decent guy and wants to be with you he'll completely understand. Stop leaving the ball in his court. Ask to see him and speak. The longer this goes on the more disconnected and resentful you'll feel towards him.
47,"I had the exact same decision to make. ""Fairy-tale"" like I was more attracted to her.  I chose not to pursue.  I still might regret it someday.

But your gf deserves someone who genuinely wants to devour her, not someone who feels repelled when hving to force affection.  Resentment will build, the problem will NOT get smaller, and you'll be in a worse spot than where you are now.

""Do I stay together?"" 

It sounds like you already answered that."
48,"You can bring it up with her by telling her you could smell it, and went to investigate. 

Sounds like text book eating disorder behaviour to me."
49,"This quote from We Bought a Zoo seems appropriate:

&gt; You know, sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it."
50,"yeah, four hours, in the middle of the night, away from his hotel... dude was out paying for sex or something. regardless, he's clearly lying and if he won't come clean to his wife that's reason enough to drop his ass this time."
51,This is not how you treat someone you care about.
52,"Cosigned, and I say that as a Christian married to an atheist. The problem here isn't that OP and her husband don't share 100% of their values and beliefs; few couples do, even if they're both Christians or both Wiccans or both liberals or both libertarians. The problem is that the practical application of their beliefs and values differs in a manner that renders them incompatible with regard to one of the most important decisions most people make in their personal life, i.e. whether or not to have kids and how to raise them.

I'm a vegan Christian, and when we married my husband was a meat-eating atheist (now actually has become 99% vegetarian just by his own personal interest, but I was never expecting that). The reason it's not a problem for us is that we agreed in advance of marriage about how we'd handle these things in our family, and we continue to have open discussions about these topics and similar ones, and we're able to always meet in the middle and compromise. If OP and her husband can't do so, then they should move on before they have kids for sure."
53,"&gt;then he'd do everything he could to wake up earlier 

If only there were some sort of technology that would allow you to schedule a wake-up call.  Some sort of alarm or something.  Really would have been useful for him in this situation!"
54,"&gt;Band Practice in 45 minutes...and they want to go get lunch afterward? What kind of priority is that?

Seriously, unless he's in a famous and well-paying band and that is his primary career, this is absolutely BS. He's putting his hobby ahead of you. 90% of people I know are in some kind of a band. I myself was in a band, but we put our real lives ahead of band practice, Jesus.

OP, your bf is de-prioritizing you. I don't think he knows what that means. He is literally choosing to go have fun with his friends instead of having a talk. He doesn't want to have a talk and if you agreed to a different day, he'd just blindside you again. There's nothing wrong with breaking up over text. It sounds like he knows it's coming and doesn't even care."
55,"He knows she didn't cheat. He's emotionally abusing her, and the real goal out of this is to make her feel guilty and sad, and that she ""owes"" him and has to ""make it up to him"". That way, he can treat her however he likes, with the hope that she'll think ""well I deserve this, Im so untrustworthy"". It's classic abuser behavior, I've experienced it first hand."
56,"OP, can you please out your update in a bigger size, or otherwise more prominently? 

So many people were *so, so, sooooo* confident of their judgment. I think it would be worth it for them to see that they were wrong. It might be a good opportunity for them to reflect on jumping to conclusions."
57,"I had a boyfriend who did something similar. He accused me of cheating even though there was no way it could've happened. I ended up staying with him for another year. By the time we broke up I had to look down at the ground when I was with him because everytime I looked up he accused me of being obsessed with whomever I just glanced at, and it would turn into him screaming at me and being upset for days on end. Get out now before it gets worse!"
58,"Okay, I viewed the phone records at his provider, not just on his laptop or whatever. Turns out the screenshots weren't real. When I asked his ex to prove that they were sent from his number, she ""deleted"" him at a contact on her phone to show the number they came from and it was his old number. Not his current one that he's had for the past year. It seems she went back and saved his contact name under his old phone number to make it look like it was sent from that, unbeknownst to the fact that he had changed his number after they broke up. 

As for the tattoo, he had posted about it on reddit and forgot. I guess she remembered his reddit username and found his post history and connected the dots. 

And as for why no one likes her, I can safely say this wasn't something that he had told me to make her out to be the ""crazy ex"". I was his friend for three years before we had ever dated and I remember hearing from other people that they didn't like her. The energy was always off when she was around and when he and I finally got together, his sister was like, ""You're so much better than Rachel. Did you know she tried to key my car once?"" ... so I think it's safe to say she was actually as toxic as he had described. Worse in fact. 

He's contacting his lawyer to see if there's anything he can do to make sure she doesn't spread lies about him anymore. Even just a letter to scare her straight. 

I'm ... still in shock over every aspect of the situation. But I'm glad he didn't cheat. And his friends verified that he went home when the rest of them had. Their girlfriends and boyfriends have also backed the story up. They have no reason to lie for him."
59,"I was going to ask if he cheated on you before but then I saw you mentioned him being sober, which to me implied he had an alcohol problem in the past. This was interesting to me because when I was reading your post, everything you said sounds like a guy who went out and got drunk. Especially if he has a history of it and that would also explain the secretiveness. 

You have to look out for you and your child so Im not trying to be an apologist for this guy. Im just saying substance abuse is mental health issue. Its not some moral failing on his part, whereas cheating would have been

Maybe him going off and getting drunk is worth leaving him over to you as well, I dont know anything about yall besides this post. Just wanted to say my reading of this sounded just as much like a guy who went out drinking as it sounded like a guy who cheated. What matters is how different the two are regarding your trust in him"
60,"If anyone I was dating, married to or even considered a friend or loved one told me to “deal with it” after I expressed my feelings to them we’d have a MAJOR problem."
61,"Yeah this is really, really bad. It would be one thing if he had lied about being married years and years ago for a short time or something- this was a woman he was literally still legally married to when you met, moved in, and had a child together. The fact that he didn't tell you at the time is nothing short of an enormous breach of trust that I don't know if I could come back from. Also the fact that he's trying to downplay the situation and call YOU crazy for being bothered by it is straight up gaslighting and entering abusive territory. If it were me I would demand therapy with him about this and if he doesn't go, leave his ass"
62,"He doesn't want to talk. Just break up with him, he's clearly not putting any effort into this relationship. You shouldn't waste time on guys like this. You should free yourself of the burden of trying desperately to get him to care about you, and date around until you find someone who clearly makes you a priority."
63,My ex-husband peed in my parents’ pantry one night after a bachelor party. Lol it sure is a thing!
64,"Jesus Christ that's not healthy. I'll bet money she has a lot more in debt than you realize.  

At her age that's really frightful. She should be thinking about retirement and saving up. Not spending money like water. Its particularly concerning that she's racking uo debts without consulting you and expecting you to bail her out.

You should see a financial planner and a couples counselor."
65,No but this is a form of it. He's literally losing 100% of his money at this place because winning gets you cheap stuffies. He sounds addicted.
66,"Religion and raising children are really important for relationships. Some relationships thrive despite having different religions, but it seems like your husband isn’t okay with it. Meaning, you’re fundamentally not compatible. You could and maybe should try couples therapy before divorce, but like you said it’s good you’re realizing this all when you’re young."
67,"Requiring an STD test prior to sex is not unreasonable. That he is balking at this is a significant red flag.

Are you open to other types of condoms? Because not using condoms at all is also a red flag.

Honestly, if he can't handle open communication about these issues, then he is not mature enough to date, let alone have sex with."
68,So glad to hear you’re taking care of yourself!
69,"Obviously I can’t be 100% sure but yes, it sounds like she’s making it up.

When I was 15 my stepmother was diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour and died 5 months later. After she was diagnosed, one of my closest friends told us he had found out he had a medical condition where his heart could stop at any time and he wouldn’t live past 18. It just... it was obviously bullshit. I can’t even remember exactly what details he told us but we suspected it was a load of crap within about a week - said he’d had hospital appointments/scans etc but it just didn’t add up. My best friend called his dad innocently asking about the tests and surprise! Turned out his dad had no idea and it was a lie.

I was really, really upset. This was like a week after my stepmum had collapsed out of the blue and had emergency surgery, and we’d been told she had a grade 4 brain tumour. My friend lied to me about being terminally ill out of jealousy and a need for attention - like my situation was anything to be jealous of. My mum called my school and had a long chat with my head of year, and idk what was said but I was told by the headmaster that he ‘would never say anything like that again, and if he did he would be expelled’. So yeah, I eventually forgave him after about a year because I couldn’t hold onto the hatred but I’ll never forget it. It really hurt me during a very hard time.

I dunno if you can really ‘call her out’ on this like I did but I think deep down you know it’s not true, and should distance yourself from this person. I had appendicitis a couple of years ago and had minor keyhole surgery to remove my appendix, and there is no way I would have been able to go to a bar 2 days after. The anaesthetic alone knocks you out for days. So if she’s supposedly had even the smallest abdominal surgery with general anaesthetic, I highly highly doubt she’d be able to do what she’s been doing.

So as I say, I don’t think it’s worth calling her out or saying anything as you can never be 100% sure, but I absolutely would distance myself from this friendship pronto. Looking back my friend who lied about being ill had some serious mental health issues, but he was also objectively an awful friend who hurt me terribly. So don’t bother trying to ‘blame’ or even focus on her, just distance yourself. From experience, people who lie about things like that are not worth hanging around, whether they can ‘help’ it or not."
70,"You said he went to the pub with friends right? Did you ask them for any verification about the night’s events?

Of course, if he did cheat, then there’s a chance he already told his friends to lie and cover him, but it wouldn’t hurt to ask and see if their stories at least line up.

Sadly, the avoidance of phone records and the tattoo already say a lot."
71,"Stop. Stop right now. Do not look at Old Flame as a solution. Of course it seems fun. Right now your home life with Husband sucks, so you have a new friendship with Old Flame and it seems so nice and interesting.

The reality of you two being together would be so much different to what it is now. Right now it is fun, it is taboo and exciting, sneaking around and being each others escape from (presumably) boring lives.

Do not view these two men as a choice. Look at your Husband. Look at the good and the bad. Decide if you want to be with him for being with him, not because there is the possibility of another guy. Decide if you think this can be repaired, if you want to repair it and talk to him. Tell him how you feel.

If you decide you do not want to be with him, break up. Sort out the divorce and all that before jumping into another relationship.

The grass will always look greener on the other side. Relationships are hard work, you need to put the effort into them. The same may happen with Old Flame, in time if you do not try then you just will drift and be roommates."
72,"Hes blaiming you for cheating a bunch and it never took place, you were around him the whole night pretty much. I'm wondering what happens if you dont talk to him for a solid 24 hours."
73,I bet the guy admitted to/let it slip that he found you attractive and *that's* why she abruptly ended the friendship.
74,When I reflect on it even now I think I can completely forgive and forget but the more I interact with people on this thread I think the real issue is that I don't know that the way I'm being her friend is helpful for her or me. Am I just enabling her? Am I just stressing her out even more? Would she be better served if I just stepped back for a while until she is able to resume a friendship with me?
75,"Your boyfriend is an idiot in several ways, not the least of which being he apparently doesn't think women *enjoy* sex. That is a super fucking concerning attitude. Not to mention the fact that if you want to have children, this is not a person to be wasting your time with.

Honestly, I'd just dump him. Some people are simply too dumb to date. If he was this stupid at like, 12 years old, it might be worth waiting around to see him wise up., but at 21? Nah. Just not worth the gamble on that he may or may not grow the hell up."
76,"You are giving it to him. Set a date and time to collect his things. Notify him of that date/time by email AND text, letting him know that he must take everything he left behind and anything left after the allotted time will be discarded. Period. Have a trusted adult friend or family member there with you at the appointed time. Someone who will not escalate things, should a situation arise. Send your daughter out with a friend or family member for the day so she doesn’t have to deal with this disruption. If you need extra assistance/protection, call the Sheriffs dept and make an Appt for the time/date to come and oversee the process ( depending on where you live, they may just tell to you call back on the day of). If ex doesn’t show up, or if he chooses not to take all of his belongings, pack them into trash bags and throw them out. 

I have been through this exact process and was advised by the police to handle it this way. I did so and it went quite smoothly. Done was DONE. 

Good luck with the uncontrollable things...but for the rest, make a Plan."
77,"&gt;	he did *something*

He was out drinking and fucking prostitutes."
78,"She told you she wanted you to call her to talk about it. Don’t overthink this. 

Yes, she has mental health issues, but in no way does it mean that she can’t make her own decisions. 

If you want to end this friendship, do it because that’s what you want. Don’t tell yourself, and her, that you’re doing it because she would be better served that way."
79,"Your cousins and sisters are their own people and if they want a relationship with you, they'll have one."
80,"So your gf is emotionally cheating on you with your ""best friend""? Fuck that. You need to cut them both out of your life."
81,"While you’re not entitled to his income, if he won’t treat you to a single meal in 3 years, that kind of miserly selfishness isn’t going to lead to a happy life for you."
82,"He started sober in December but also loves gambling and prostitution. A real winner. I made some serious and stupid concessions to forgive and rebuild.  Because of history, hope, having not many options of my own and a small child. And he makes the same choices and traveled the same path anyway.  

But I'm good enough to give him a haircut before he flies out. He makes a lot of promises and I wanted to believe we were building but is apparently allergic to truth and loyalty."
83,"I feel like I GET why you've said that, but my read is that this guy has some personality or behavioral disorder that manifests in needing affirmation, attention, affection, etc. from the people he cares about 24/7. I think its a very clingy dude who needs therapy rather than an unrequited love."
84,"I like to describe myself as a cat and my boyfriend as a dog. He loves affection and attention *no matter what*. He is overjoyed by me being all over him and up his ass. But, I am a cat. The more he tries to follow me around and smother me with love, the more I push him away and get grumpy. When he let's me approach him on my *own* for affection, both of us end up happy because I do give him more than he would have assumed (since I push him away so much when he chases me). 

It's not ""the chase"" or anything. I really just think due to my shitty life prior to him, I really only want affection on my own terms. I have a dismissive avoidant attachment style. Currently in therapy to resolve all of this, but I just wanted to comment and let you know other people go through it too, and it doesn't always mean something bad :)"
85,"&gt;  Am I being cheated on?

Are you really unsure about what is happening here? 

You are the **side-chick**. 

He went on an overseas vacation with his **GF** while his side-chick (you) were not able to check up on him. 

Get a clue and have some self-respect."
86,"I understand your feelings, but she wasn't perfect for you, because she's the kind of woman who doesn't like a guy like you. This is no insult to your personality either! But by definition she's not perfect for you, because to be perfect, she'd be the kind of person who liked you."
87,"It's obviously stemming from how you phrase things. Instead of saying ""I have to check with J"" about your finances or rides, just say ""I'll have to double check if I can get a ride"" or ""money's tight so I don't think I can afford to spend that much on dinner"". The way you're phrasing it makes it sound like J decides what you can and can't do, when really it's just that you can't drive and he financially supports you right now"
88,She lied. She is lying. She will lie some more. Unless you just enjoy being lied to I'd end it.
89,"If they make you feel like a third wheel when you're AROUND..then them being alone would be even worse. As in...something will probably happen. Honestly, I'm mad at them just reading this post and I think you deserve better than both of them. I feel like if they cared about doing the right thing more than their own selfish desires they wouldn't go alone to begin with."
90,"Well, she's weird at work, don't be weird at work like her.  

""Good for you, it didn't sound like your BF was a good fit for you.  We can be friends if you want, but otherwise I'm very happily married and love my wife, and I'm not looking to get together with anyone else.""  

I'd say send this over text since she seems to have less anxiety talking through that medium.

Have your wife say hi to her and engage her in a brief but vague conversation (my husband talked about you a little), and that should drive the point home.  Everyone's ""met"" everyone via Facebook, so if it's a surprise to her that you talk to your wife about things, point out that the Facebook add was her initiative.

If it doesn't stop, talk to HR too.  And keep all the conversations, because if there's mental instability, who knows what allegations may be thrown about, and you'll need proof if necessary."
91,Does someone randomly have a fertility test? That sounds fishy.
92,"So when I read your intro I was all ready to be hellfire and guns blazing that she was awful for blowing you off. But the extent of her mental health issues are... far worse than I thought. If she was incoherent and a complete disaster on your wedding day, of course she couldn’t come and honestly, you wouldn’t have wanted her there.

Weddings are so stressful and emotional and I am sorry she let you down in so many ways, especially since your wedding was so small. However, I think writing off your friendship wouldn’t be the right thing to do. I do think you should just learn to not expect anything from her. Check in on her mental health, and accept her apology, and appreciate your wedding for those who were there and the wonderful day you had."
93,"Yeah. I can get really worked up over little things like this and completely miss that my wife is thinking of some big over-arching issue when I’m really only thinking about whether we should get creamy or crunchy peanut butter. If I step back and realize it’s not actually about peanut butter, I can put things in perspective pretty quickly and avoid fighting."
94,"He has not told his ""ex"" about you because he still wants to make it work with her. 

He obviously still wants to be with her. 

He would rather be with her than you. 

**You're the side-chick.**"
95,Give Ali the table back and let her ride of into the sunset with it. She's a shitty friend and you'll be far better if without her causing stress in your life.
96,"You're right, things could be worse. But, that IS abuse. You are being abused. You do not deserve to be treated this way, no one deserves to be treated this way. Just because he didn't push you hard enough to physically hurt you doesn't mean it's not abuse. I want you to know that he absolutely IS abusing you and you do not and should not have to accept that type of behavior from him or anyone else."
97,Why did he say he was “hoping” to be up earlier? He’s the one in control of when he wakes up. He’s obviously outright avoiding talking to you at this point or just isn’t registering the seriousness of the situation. I’m leaning towards it being the first tbh.
98,"She doesnt want an open relationship, she wants a free pass to cheat."
99,"Please just take everything one day at a time. 

It sounds like the wedding was over a week ago, so everything is still SUPER fresh. You don't have to address it now, today or tomorrow. You can send a quick text that says, ""I really care about you, but I'm not ready to talk about it right now. Now about as meet up for coffee in two weeks, and give eachother space until?""

You don't have to decide The Future of Your Friendship, or what you need to do for T's well-being right now. You're allowed to focus on yourself for the moment (and getting a therapist to support you through that sounds like a fantastic idea). Giving T some space and time to figure out what to say to you would probably be a kindness as well. And if she interprets your need for space (*your* needs) as an attack on your friendship, then that's really something for her, her family and her therapist to sort out."
100,It sounds like you know what to do. Put yourself first ❤️
101,"&gt;I should support her because I'm her boyfriend and that I'm gaslighting her if I say she's wrong about her interpretation

&gt;she insists that I'm in the wrong for not immediately doing whatever I can to make her comfortable

&gt; I feel like she's just being controlling again

Sounds about right.

It's not about the friend it's about your girlfriend wanting to control you. Maybe she's used to guys wanting to do anything for her because she's pretty? 

Be very very wary, so far it sounds like you've seen through her bullshit and stayed true to yourself, but over time she can wear you down. You might one day decide that it's easier to just wear those pants or not chat to that girl for a night just to avoid confrontation, and from there it's not far until you're losing yourself and doing everything she wants."
102,"You shouldn't be paying your boyfriend's bills when you're literally going hungry yourself. And since you are, he could be more respectful- this isn't about $15 (which actually sounds like it is a huge deal for you right now), it's about the fact that you're working as hard as you can and literally starving yourself to help pay his bills, and he's not working all the hours he can and forgetting the meals you cook for him so he doesn't have to eat out."
103,"This is spot on. My boyfriend is incredibly intelligent, a chemical engineer so very science based, and he’s the most gentle and kind man I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. My dad was like OP’s husband and it gave me:

- Major depressive disorder: started when I was about 13 and I had tried to take my own life by the time I was 15.
- Anxiety and panic disorders: was terrified of anyone and everyone, would have panic attacks walking into bars or lecture theatres, was hyper self-critical and hated myself.
- Trauma symptoms: never diagnosed with a trauma disorder but would shake uncontrollably when talking about bad past experiences, had negative memories that would make me feel sick just thinking about them, still shout in my sleep almost every night.

I manage these disorders and I’m sure part of it is just my brain, but I don’t think they would have been triggered without my experiences with my abusive father and his explosive anger. I’ve had CBT, EMDR and multiple medications and I foresee I will need some sort of treatment for the rest of my life. I’m functional after years of treatment but I consider these disorders chronic, I have to manage them every day. I realised in EMDR that I cannot remember a time before being scared and anxious. I didn’t realise people had childhoods that were not anxious and full of fear, because by the time I formed memories that was my primary emotion. I genuinely thought ‘being a child’ was a state of constant worry and anxiety.

OP, your husband is not a ‘good father’. This is what he’s bestowing on your beloved child."
104,"I think she overspends on parties, trips, and eating out. Those numbers are crazy high. If she is struggling with debt then she needs to reduce the amount she spends on these types of things. You should tell her that. Be loud. Tell her she's wrong and that if debt is such a big issue for her then maybe she shouldn't be eating $80 sushi every week. 

I don't think overspending on furniture or appliances is the same. Those are items you'll use every day for years, sometimes it's worth it to invest up front to have a nice home. So don't bring that up if you confront her. 

When she calls you worthless, you should tell her immediately that she is being mean and that she is not acting like a loving partner. Again, be loud, call her out. Don't just sit there and take the verbal abuse. I'm not victim blaming, I'm just telling you, you seem really passive and a lot of these money anxieties could be avoided if you just told her No, and stuck to it. 

When she tries to guilt you into buying extra birthday gifts, more expensive birthday gifts, or spend lots of money, tell her No. So what if she cries? You said it yourself, she has a sickness. She needs therapy and a doctor's visit. You buying her $400 shoes doesn't fix anything. It temporarily stops the crying but it doesn't help with the cause. So, just don't buy her the $400 shoes. Tell her to go see a doctor. Then you have $400 in your pocket and a clear conscience. 

Right now you are enabling her and it's making you feel bad about yourself, and it's making you fall out of love with her. Stand up for yourself. Tell her how it is. Tell her to get help / facilitate ways for her to get help. You will start to feel better about yourself and you will pause the growing resentment you feel for her. It won't fix her issues, but it will stop them from affecting you as much. 

Best case scenario, she wants to change and tries. But it won't be fixed overnight. You'll need patience and forgiveness to make the marriage work.

Worst case scenario, she denies her issues, refuses help, and continues to verbally abuse you and manipulate you. Then at least you know you tried everything you could to help. Then you can choose what to do next, including divorce."
105,"Wow. I think you need an immediate appointment with your pediatrician to get some help and advice. You’re asking for reasonable help, and your husband is barely helping you with the baby and actively harming you emotionally. You both deserve time off, especially when you gave birth a MONTH ago. Your body is still healing, your baby is at his most difficult time probably ever, and you’re physically exhausted. You need some help.

First of all, your husband needs to help more at night. You both need your sleep, not just him. You both have jobs - yours is taking care of the baby and his is working. A newborn is notoriously difficult, so it is beyond ridiculous for him to say that what you’re doing isn’t that hard or isn’t work. Also, are there other family members around who could watch the baby for even 30-60 minutes while you take a shower or a nap? Are you part of any local mom groups and/or do you have anyone you can talk to on the phone who understands what you’re going through?

Your husband sounds horrific, quite frankly. I hope this is a huge change from how he used to act and that he gets it together quickly. I cannot imagine how he justifies treating you like this."
106,"Why would you want to stay with a guy who judges you and calls you a slut for something happened before you were dating, was ultimately harmless stupid teenager stuff,and has no bearing on your current relationship?"
107,"Everything about your post says that you really aren't that into this guy. 


That should be enough. 

You likely will not be friends after you break up with him, and that is okay. This is something you learn to factor into break ups. 

These type of age gaps are *generally* not surmountable, but in some specific circumstances they can be. For example, I know when I was in college, a super inexperienced international student was dating someone significantly younger than her with a ton of experience. In that case, the power dynamic was shifted a bit, which in some ways balanced the overall equation."
108,"Boyfriend? Holy mackerel, this dude is a predator, not a boyfriend. Now, you cannot persuade your friend out of that mess, unfortunately. What you can do is to be there for her. If she won't leave this shithead, she will soon need every support possible."
109,"&gt; I told him I thought I was San Francisco

Yep, definitely high"
110,I've been in the wedding party and NOT the best man 3 times so far. You know what I did each time? Not complain and do my best to contribute to the wedding lol
111,"I would turn it into a full-on breakup. If you ever wind up getting back together, fine. But to break up with the expectation of being together in the future is a bad idea. It also doesn't fully show her what it is like to be single if she knows you are waiting around for her. IMO, if she doesn't know if she wants to be with you after 5 years (and in her mid-late 20s), then I think you guys probably shouldn't be together."
112,"You have no idea how capable you are. 

You’ve been with this man for a decade so you have no idea how great you’ll be at managing as a single Mom.

You’re going to be amazing. You’re going to figure out chores and you’re going to figure out your financial situation.

You’re going to be so fucking free that for the first time ever your child will get to see what Mom looks like when she’s truly happy. Your kiddo will finally understand what joy and a safe, sane home life look like.

A few months after you separate from him, you’re going to look back on this post and shake your head at how terrified you are right now. Because by then you’ll know the fear was gone the moment you actually got away. That you built up so many excuses for so long when you were there, ready to take charge of your life the whole time.

You feel overwhelmed and freaked out and at the end of your rope. You know what makes all the logistics easier? Not being berated and abused!

It’s going to feel incredible how solid your steps are when you’re no longer walking on eggshells.

You’ve got this. You don’t know that you do yet, but you totally do. Figure out your closest ally—a family member or an old friend you can trust and count on. And, when you’re ready and after you’ve spoken to a divorce lawyer, call them up and tell them everything. Start by saying, “I am leaving my husband.” 

You will be able to get the help you ask for and you and your child deserve a stable home. Your kid deserves at least one example of happy, healthy, self assured adulthood.

And you. You deserve every happiness. You deserve peace and contentment and to feel whole and loved and good."
113,"The funnier way would be asking his parents why they keep insisting y'all have sex. 

The boring, but practical way is to have your husband speak to his parents (his family, his responsibility), and simply tell them that you two having kids is your decision as a couple, and you'll have kids when you both feel ready to have them. That this is no longer an open topic of conversation."
114,"Express to him, that he put his hand between your best friends thighs while you were beside him. So what will he do when you're not there at all?"
115,"It's been 16 years, and you're only trying to change the status quo now? Good luck with that, dude.

But if she won't get a job, then putting your foot down may be what you have to do. ""Our income does not allow for you to continue having Starbucks every day."""
116,"Girl marries much older man who turns out to be controlling. It's a pretty common story on her. You can gently talk to her about healthy relationship behaviors and ask her how she feels about her relationship. Make it clear if she ever needs someone, you are here."
117,"My whole life changed because I liked a guy and said “Fuck it, imma ask him out” 

I’m married and just had my second baby with him. He admits he was too scared and wasn’t going to ask me out. 

I’m not saying that’s for sure what’s gonna happen with you But you never know 😊"
118,"sure but she's not friends any more so all bets are off

being faithful to a friendship is a noble character quality, amongst the best character qualities

but being faithful to a dead friendship is weird, unnecessary, and socially stunting"
119,"Exactly. What alarm? I always get up in time for work by hoping for it, don't know why his didn't work.."
120,"Yep. This guy keeps renegotiating their relationship in small stages to push past OP's reluctance. He suggested a short term thing to get her used to thinking of him as more than a one night stand, and now he's trying to stretch that too. It's so manipulative."
121,"In those cases, a text message breakup sounds downright benevolent."
122,"One the one hand take everything at face value - her issues aren't her fault, they're real, and if she can't overcome them, well, she can't overcome them. That sucks, and it's sad for her, but it happens. Althought one thing that marginally rubs me up the wrong way is her texting and asking you to call her so she can explain. She's got a phone! She could call and explain, leave a voicemail, whatever. Putting the burden on you to contact her is unreasonable. Might be due to her anxiety, might be she can't overcome it, in which case she needs to explain that, not just drop you a ""call me"" text.

*However*, that doesn't mean you have to be endlessly accommodating either. You don't have to judge her or criticise her, but you don't have to be carrying the full weight of this relationship either. It might just be that her anxiety means she's incapable of being a good friend to you. And as such you're not obliged to do the work of two people. Her mental stability isn't your responsibility - you've got your own to handle, you've got your new husband to be primarily responsible to. You're not causing her mental health issues. You don't have to cut her off, but you can stop making so much effort. 

Even if her issues aren't her *fault*, they're still her *responsibility*, and if they're the cause of a huge amount of hurt for you, you can't be expected to just forgive and forget. If I had a friend who had spasms, and they lashed out and broke my nose, all the apologies in the world don't fix my nose, don't make it not hurt. And bluntly, if they're prone to physicality like that and I put myself in range again, that's sort of on me more than them. They can't help lashing out, I *can* stop myself from endlessly being in harm's way. Goes for emotional pain too."
123,Oh it's definitely a romantic relationship for one of them...
124,This guy is bad news. He's pursued you aggressively despite you being so much younger. I would not trust him.
125,Notice how his violent reactions are always someone else’s fault. He is starting to sound like one of those “all my exes are crazy” type people.
126,"Hindsight is 20/20 and all, but the way you tell the story makes it sound like there were many glaring signs that your friend could not really be trusted for this, and you chose to ignore them. She even indirectly told you that she wanted you to take her off the wedding, and you didn't:

&gt;I get a text from her later that night apologizing for not coming to the rehearsal and saying that **she would understand if I wanted to take her out of the wedding**. I told her I hope she was feeling better and **I would love for her to still be in the wedding** and it’s not like rehearsals are that important anyway. 

It is not that you are a good friend or a bad friend, it's that you are confusing 'kindness' with 'looking the other way.'"
127,You are right. Thank you.
128,"Tell her, ""Don't talk about my beautiful girlfriend that way."""
129,Is your stepdad a cat?
130,"$2000 sounds like what you might spend on a 21st, an engagement or even a small wedding. Not a fucking toddler's birthday party."
131,"When she was passing out at 7 during your visit, was that due to medication? Has she been really relying on benzo's to control anxiety? Did her parents stop her from using those meds immediately leading up to the ceremony?"
132,"Oh man I also went for a 12 mile run through Golden Gate Park on that trip.  Some randos offered me weed in Buena Vista Park (I know, different park) and I accepted.  Then I found myself in running clothes, four miles from where I was staying, trying to buy armfuls of food from the Whole Foods on Haight Street.  

Fortunately the line was really really long so I had to put back all the food and just wander the store grazing on samples and hoping nobody would notice.  

But uh....  I don’t have a substance abuse problem at home so I didn’t need to lie and my husband thought it was hilarious."
133,"This. 

There is no need to stay and have this conversation in person, in a place where there are firearms, where you feel there is a likelihood where he may harm you or himself in reaction to anything you are doing or saying.

I wouldn't even do this in public if there's a reasonable expectation of him taking a firearm into the situation, because that not only puts you at risk, but everyone around you.

I would get yourself to the airport as quickly as possible and worry about the consequences when you have a big distance between you again."
134,"Honestly I wouldn’t even text him again. Just stop communicating and if he texts you, say there is nothing to discuss bc the relationship is done. Be free!"
135,"Honey, he was WAY too old to be acting like this. By 28, you should know how to drink responsibly. 

Also, what he said about the key and rent is really bothersome. Is he aggressive in general?

I do think you should sit down and talk it out before falling off the wedding."
136,"Nick and your mom sound great. Sorry about your dad. He's just jealous that you asked someone else for help, even though he wouldn't have been able to help you. He's also sad that your mom moved on, but it was him who cheated on her. Your mom is doing what is right for herself. Hopefully, your dad eventually moves on and finds someone else to date instead of bringing you into the drama.

I'm sorry your dad is petty enough to miss three weekends with you. But it also shows his character. He's not a very mature person. He's jealous enough of your mom's new boyfriend that he chooses to not spend time with his own kid, you. Your dad's character is not very good. 

Best of luck. And know that it's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. You're just a kid."
137,"Look, with all due respect, i wish I could reach through my monitor to grab you by the shoulders and shake you while shouting ""snap out of it!""

He lied to your face.  I don't care if he lied about using toothpaste or about being married - he lied to you and you would have never known about this if you didn't figure it out yourself.  And he lied about being *married*.  WTF that is so bizarre and major a thing to lie about.  Finally, he is unrepentant in the extreme, told you he'd do it again, and worst of all, is treating you like some kind of idiot who can be convinced you're crazy for caring about this and people lie about their marital status all the time!  No!

The reason I want to shake you is because it's working!  You are reacting like this is a level 4 problem when it's a level 10. Your plan, as stated, is to wait and not talk about it on the theory he will spontaneously develop integrity and apologize to you.  You are living in lala land.  That's just not how this works.  The far more likely outcome is that you... Simply never talk about or resolve this, you figure out a way to keep dating and marry him while never bringing it up to avoid a fight, and you spend the rest of your time together anxious about his trustworthiness and reliving this incident over and over."
138,"It sounds like she has depression. 

My husband and FIL also have/had it. It's completely encompassing. There is no going out, they have/had no energy. My FIL is currently in a facility because of severe depression and there is no way he would be able to handle a wedding or any big social activity like that, even for an hour. He missed spending a week with his only grandchildren that he adores because of being in the facility (we live 12 hours away and had been planning this trip for a year).

It's hard when loved ones go through this, it will be a lifetime of work for her to stay on top of if it is depression. But with proper treatment and time, it may take years, you'll ""see"" your friend again. 

Please consider reaching out to her since she texted you, if it is depression, I'm sure this was very difficult for her to miss too."
139,"It just... hurts my brain. 

We both like being together. If I end things, we will both be very sad. I'll miss her, she'll miss me. 

Is attraction so important? That it can ruin a relationship that both parties enjoy? 

I hate it. I WISH I wanted to devour her, mate."
140,"Yeah you really don't want to outright say it. Before I broke up with my ex, I was trying to discuss with him how I felt rejected and unloved by him and after I had told him how I felt he said ""I don't find you sexually attractive. This is so hard for me to say yada yada."" Now it prolly was hard for him to say, but I couldn't respond how he wanted because of how broken and rejected I had been feeling and I just broke, I felt gross for ever wanting intimacy and all that. He's not wrong for saying it, he really could've reworded it or had said it at a time when I wasn't on the verge of breaking down."
141,"Right?  Like why is he reading stuff from when she was in *high school*??  Who judges an adult for normal teenage behavior?  I'm sure my husband sent and received dirty messages before he met me but...why tf would I care?  He sounds hugely misogynistic, manipulative, and controlling.  OP, you should get out now before it gets worse."
142,I've taken more than 4 months off life due to anxiety and depression. It can be very severe.
143,He’s very immature if discussing this makes him uncomfortable. You’re doing the responsible thing by bringing all of this up and I hope you don’t let him pressure you into backing down on your (very reasonable) requests.
144,"Of course it's a huge violation of trust and a *massive* lie of omission. It's pretty fucking galling that he is continuing to backpedal on this and trying to blame you for having a reaction to his deceit.

&gt;He has made statements that basically only I would feel betrayed, and that I’m probably in the minority of people in this world that would let this bother them this much. He say’s it wouldn’t bother him, roles reversed, but I can’t picture that being true

He's full of shit. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who *wouldn't* feel betrayed and devasted to find their partner of over two years had lied and concealed a 6 year marriage from them. And honestly, even if he was somehow right and ""only you"" would be bothered by that....you're supposed to be the only one that matters: the fact that you are feeling betrayed should be enough for him to honor that feeling.

His behavior is sickening. There can never be trust in a relationship with a guy like this: leave him and let him try to find someone who's ok with his lies."
145,"If your boyfriend didn't want to ride in your car because it's blue, he'd be within his rights. He doesn't have to ride with you. It's reasonable for you to be annoyed about this, but he is the boss of his own body and he doesn't want to put it in a car that you're driving.

My youngest sister totalled six cars in her first six years of driving. She's been in at least ten accidents. She stopped telling me about them years ago, so I don't know how many there really have been. As far as I know, absolutely no accident she's ever been in, including the ones where she totalled a car, were legally her fault.

I still don't get in a car if she's driving, because while she doesn't break the law or drive unsafely per se (except the incident in New York about which we Do Not Speak), she's so checked out while she's driving that she's terrifying to ride with."
146,"&gt; My partner is perfect in every way except for this little detail: he's trying to force my door right now with a knife in his hand and blood in his eyes, what do I do?

No no NO. Have you tried talked to him? Come back when you have."
147,He loves gambling and hookers and now he’s out taking 3-4 hour walks at 2 am? We all know he wasn’t taking a walk.
148,"I think you did the right thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Being single is scary at first, and there are always a whole load of ""what ifs."" But all we can do is make the best decisions we can with the information we have available to us. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you genuinely feel in your gut that she's not a long term partner for you, you owe it to yourself to find the person who is and you owe it to your girlfriend to let her find someone who is a HELL YES on her. She's 27, so if her ideal scenario is to be married by 30 you absolutely did the right thing breaking it off now. The years come quickly, and starting again at 27/28 is cutting it close to hit her target when you consider time to heal, time to find a partner, time to explore the relationship, getting engaged, and then getting married.

&amp;#x200B;

Try not to ever make decisions out of fear. And if your biggest fear is that 5 years from now you'll feel regret, then you have definitely made the right call. Regret doesn't know what could have been, would have been, or should have been. It's just fear.  When regret rears its ugly head, remember that you made the best call you could at the time in a world of no guarantees.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep following your instincts and make the best decisions you can. The rest will work itself out."
149,My only comment is that I’ve had weight loss surgery and I could not have gone out for a drink 2 days later. I could barely sip lukewarm water.
150,"Agree--wait until she's caught entering the house on the security camera before you change the locks--from the way OP describes the sister, it sounds like it wouldn't occur to her to have the key copied."
151,"He doesn't love you. If he hasn't figured it out after 2 years together, he never will."
152,"1. She lied to you
2. She cheated on you
3. She shows no remorse - no apology
4. She's blaming you for her infidelity
5. She potentially exposed you to STD's

&amp;#x200B;

OP: why do you feel like she needs another chance? She's made it crystal clear how she feels about you."
153,"No, because then he'll just procrastinate until the end of your time frame and then ask for an extension, just so he can drag this out longer.

""Ex: you need to come pick up the remainder of your stuff this Saturday at 12:00. Anything you have not picked up by that time will be going in the trash."""
154,"&gt; I've considered starting over. I know I'm an interesting person; I make others feel heard because I'm a great listener. Maybe moving somewhere else, or trying out for a play at a local community theater would make me better. 

Doesn't matter where you move to, you can't escape yourself ..."
155,"This literally happened to me this week, haha. 
Either you make one last ditch effort and say “our relationship is in jeopardy here &amp; it is important that you make time for me to talk”. 

If he still doesn’t get it, ending it over text or a phone call is acceptable in my opinion. I had to do it. It had been a consistent theme in my relationship and this was the straw that broke the camels back and really just confirmed my decision for me."
156,"You think that your child will remain immune to his yelling? Please, please, take steps to get out of this relationship. Emotional abuse is just as damaging as physical abuse.

Your husband is not a good man. You deserve to feel safe in your own home. Your child deserves a safe home."
157,"THIS.  Why would he have the need to say that no cheating happened if he didn't cheat.  Apparently in the comments OP mentions that he has cheated on her in the past.

I agree with you he cheated."
158,"I was in a similar relationship when I was your age and it was a bad idea. 

The difference in maturity and life stages in your late teens vs late 20s is huge. 

Older men often target younger women as they're naive and inexperienced. They want someone they can control, who they can mold, who doesn't have the life experience to see their toxic behaviours or call them on them. 

What grown man has so much more in common with a teenager than he does women his own age? It's highly unlikely. 

From what you've mentioned in your post it also doesn't seem like you have a lot in common. Really think about where those commonalities lie. Are they interests or opinions of his he's brought up and you've agreed with because he seems smart or cool? Or are they things you've brought up he's never mentioned before but is suddenly all about the second you show your interest?
Because neither of those scenarios mean you have common interests. 

The ""you're so mature for your age"" line is classic abuser/groomer lingo, and I wouldn't trust any man who tells you that. 

Also it implies he's going to expect you to act older than you are which isn't fair as you're young and you deserve to be young, to feel young, and to act young. 

If you really do like him, stay friends. Then when you're older and are actually more mature - date then.

If he's unwilling to wait for you you're obviously not as special or in sync with him as he's trying to make you believe."
159,"You’re contemplating an affair in the midst of two marriages, wondering if it’s a good idea?  

Say goodbye to the old flame.  He’s married. 

Offer marriage counseling to your husband. He’s going through a midlife crisis and doesn’t trust you’ll be there to support him emotionally.  If he refuses, you ca get a divorce. 

The other guy doesn’t have the balls to fix his marriage or divorce his wife. The grass looks greener only because they throw a lot of shit on it."
160,"&gt;mocked me by fake crying while saying ""boo hoo she wanted to be a 10.""

Contempt is a usually a sign the relationship is over..."
161,"You break up with her. 

She is choosing to stay with him."
162,"&gt; He has made statements that basically only I would feel betrayed, and that I’m probably in the minority of people in this world that would let this bother them this much

Probably because he's manipulative and quite good at gaslighting you. Also, I would bet my next paycheck on the fact that this is NOT the only lie he's told you. I hope you're prepared to uncover some absolutely ridiculous and cold hearted lies over the next couple of years if you choose to stay with him."
163,"&gt;Is attraction so important? 

Well:

&gt; but as we spend more time together it's incredibly becoming an issue.   
&gt;  
&gt; Our sex life is declining rapidly   
&gt;  
&gt;  I'm having to force physical affection   
&gt;  
&gt; compliments feel hollow, or forced.  

It clearly is. Everyone wants to be with someone their attracted to and that's attracted to them, it's just part of being human. This isn't a fairytale. This problem is just going to keep getting worse and you are not doing yourself or her any favors by dragging this out."
164,"Its his band members birthday dude, of course he can't skip lunch after practice.  And waking up earlier obviously wasn't an option.  So I don't know what you expect this guy to do here."
165,"They live together but she doesn’t know he’s going out of the country?

Guy is legitimately living a double life."
166,"They....want.....you....to ..... be ...ok.... with.... them....dating.

Are you serious? Actually, the question is are *they* serious. This is betrayal on a level that is hard to comprehend. Cut both of these animals out of your life, get yourself someone to talk to, and then go to war.

The narative needs to come from you. Do not let them define what happened here to your friend group."
167,Piggy-backing on this comment to drive home the point: I’m in my late 20’s and I would never date an 18-year-old. We’re in different leagues as far as life experience and I couldn’t imagine how that kind of power imbalance would mess with them.
168,Don't make any decisions until you have the results and have spoken with the genetic counselor. There's 50% chance he's not affected after all
169,Break up with her. In words.
170,I agree with the sentiment in general but there are certainly important cases (especially abuse) where that is not good advice.
171,"Well, go into the conversation realizing that your husband is so incredibly wrong here. It's worrying that your immediate reaction to this seems to be to accept he is reacting appropriately, and that you must somehow pacify and mollify the man who woke you up to tell you he'd invaded your privacy, call you a slut, threaten divorce and basically drastically overreact to something which has about as much impact on your relationship as whether it was raining last Tuesday. 

In the time between now and his arrival home, correct your own narrative about what happened here and what sort of reaction this deserves. Go to loveisrespect(dot)org and read through some of their resources. Don't let him make you believe you were wrong for being a horny, dumb teenager."
172,My ex used to ask me to wake her up in the morning when I left. She was heavy sleeper though and would often go back to sleep right after I woke her up. I got so tired of trying to wake her up and get ready for work that I just stopped trying.
173,"Not only is he de-prioritizing her, he is doing it \*when that is what brought on this situation\*! 

He has no intention of improving. Do yourself a favour, OP, and send that final break up text. Or consider that text you've already sent him as the break up announcement."
174,"&gt; Did you ask them for any verification about the night’s events?

OP just posted that [she did](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccszvv/my_28f_boyfriends_32m_exgirlfriend_30f_from_just/etq0c6f/), and not only did his friends (and their SOs) verify that his version of events was correct, but his provider gave records that showed the texts were fake."
175,"&gt; I think his point of view is that if Katie was a male, I wouldn’t think twice about him going. He refers to her has a close friend of his and has expressed he doesn’t want that to change.

Does he put his hands between other dudes inner thighs, and caress them? No?? Then it's not the same scenario."
176,Could not agree more! He is definitely projecting. His work habits and views are unhealthy and not a good way to have any type of balanced life style. Keep doing what you’re doing and enjoy your work and your sanity.
177,"Yeah I’d stop including your husband every time you say no to something or have to check if you can afford it. Eventually it *does* start to sound like you have to get “permission” from your husband if his name comes up in your hesitations every time your friends invite you somewhere. 

If you’re not sure you can afford something, say *you* are not sure it’s in the budget. If you’re not sure you’ll have time or be available, say *you* have to check your schedule. Own your choices and your decision-making process. Once you start doing this, it’ll be harder for your friends to blame your husband every time you say no to their plans."
178,"It is absolutely unfair to expect your daughter to keep this (or anything) from her husband, and I don't think you should expect her to keep it from her siblings, either. Even if you don't want support, she needs it herself. She should not have to carry this knowledge alone."
179,"She is taking responsibility, she just isn't progressing according to your standards. And btw, chronic anxiety is rarely handled by inpatient care."
180,"&gt;I just feel like I shouldn't have to tell him how to love me.

Here's where you're wrong. *Tell people how to love you.* Be as direct and forthcoming as possible. People aren't mindreaders, and sometimes the best intentions are lost or misinterpreted. 

It's great that you've talked to him about this. Have you explicitly said all the things you told us? ""I feel emotionally unsupported when I don't hear from you. I would like to hear from you everyday because it feels reassuring that you're checking in on me."" Be that blunt. 

When you tell someone exactly how to love you, and they still don't make the effort, then you know it's because they've chosen not to, not because they don't know how.

Many amazing people date but find they aren't compatible in the way they love each other, and that's okay. They either break up or figure how to compromise. Those are really your only options.

You've been with this man for over a year. You should be able to talk openly about this and either:
A) fix it together
B) decide the relationship isn't working.

It's not too much to ask to feel connected in your relationship. It's the entire point. Should the result be B, know that it doesn't mean anyone is a bad person. It just means two people couldn't love in the way the other needed."
181,"Yes most people strive to be attracted to someone they are romantically involved with. Because that’s what typically makes a romantic relationship something different than just a friendship. In my opinion. I like my friends personalities and some of them are attractive, but I find my partner sexually attractive in a different way. It seems like you would’ve been better off just being friends with this person. If I found out my boyfriend didn’t find me physically attractive I would probably be more devastated than if he had just broken up with me 6 months in. It’s wonderful that you love her personality, but there needs to be a mix of personality and looks. 

Also, physically attractiveness tends to fade over time. So it’s probably not going to get any better."
182,"&gt;respect myself enough to not be with a cheater.

lawyer up, gather evidence against her, dna test that child."
183,Sorry but I wouldn’t drive with you either.
184,"Yep. I feel you. I met a woman who was AMAZING - smart, powerful, funny, and actually beautiful. But I somehow wasn't attracted to her, even though she was literally perfect and we got on great. We dated for a bit and I realised I was forcing myself to go to bed with her. I broke up with her, we stayed friends and I am so happy that she agreed to stay in my life. 

Your girlfriend deserves better. YOU deserve better. Your girlfriend sounds great, and if you break up with her, she's going to find someone else who loves her for all of those wonderful things about her, and who finds her attractive on top of that.

Sometimes the chemistry just isn't there, and there's nothing you can do about it. However, leading someone on and faking it IS something you can do something about. You gave it a shot! You're both good people, you're just not right for each other in that dynamic."
185,"Imagine this were not a mental health issue, but a physical health issue. If your friend were throwing up blood or having violent seizures, you wouldn't expect her to come to the wedding, right? Well she has about as much control over her mental health issues as she would about a physical health issue.

Understandable that you are hurt, and totally ok if this is the straw that breaks the camel's back in your friendship, but do your best to not take it as a personal attack."
186,"I think there are a lot of things we dont know here: is this how he lives, or does he luxuriate without you? Is he saving for something like a house, or is he meticulous about his retirement? Is he generous in his way to you? Aside from finances do you have other big issues? and lastly would it be possible that he is under the impression you wanted to keep things at 50/50 in your price range to maintain equality in the power dynamic in your relationship?- for example if you say ""I dont want to go to that fancy restaurant, I cant afford it"" you may be saying ""lets go someplace I can afford, so we can split it"" OR you may be saying""I would love to go, if you are taking me, as it is out of my budget""   not saying this is the case, I have very little info, but the gist is you may both hear the same thing, and think it obvious what is being said, and each have a different understanding of what the message was.

 At the end of the day, none of what I am asking about may be relevant if you are not getting the treatment you want. If you are getting the treatment you want aside from him not paying, figure out if you can live with it, as I doubt it will change. Keep in mind that cheap now can lead to very rich later, if he is possibly a very long term thing, that could be a very good thing. At least thats what they tell me."
187,"That's not how this works though. You tell him you're broken up, you're broken up. If he calls, don't answer. If he texts, don't respond. If he gets on a plane and comes to see you, don't answer the door. If he won't leave, call the cops.

You're not his property. He doesn't control you."
188,"I wouldn't be so sure. I was off for seven months with those things. It can be crippling and leave you barely functioning.

I feel for T and hope she gets the support she needs. She's clearly in a very bad place. Easily said OP, but I'd try to forget the wedding absence - it's not really her fault and not something she can just very easily ignore for a social event - and let her know you're there to support her if she needs you. She's probably already deeply embarrassed and ashamed to miss your wedding."
189,He's dating a barely legal adult because women his age wouldn't put up with any of his crap. Younger and more inexperienced women can be manipulated easier.
190,If Katie was a male you wouldn’t think twice because he wouldn’t be feeling her up at a festival like he would with his male friends.
191,"I’m so scared that this is what’s happening in my relationship. :( Sorry, I don’t have any advice"
192,"Nothing really concrete to say he’s cheating.

If he blacks out often he might have a problem with alcohol."
193,"Sex or drugs are the only reasons he'd be in that neighborhood at that time.

He's being dishonest again."
194,"My paternal grandparents were Southern Baptist (I'm from Mississippi and they were in a particularly rural part of the state). Not only were the Sunday services very uncomfortable when I went as a little girl, but my grandmother's funeral was legit insane. I didn't realize until then (I was about 20 and hadn't gone to that church in ages) how OBSESSED with death they are. So much of each sermon (there were 3 different ones) was basically, ""She's in heaven now, which as we all know is great because we all long for death because life on earth is basically hell already."" 

Which, like, mood. But they were being very serious. So creepy. I'm Agnostic now, but I'm so glad I was raised Episcopalian. For MS especially, it was the best possible brand of Christianity for me available."
195,"&gt; But the extent of her mental health issues are... far worse than I thought. If she was incoherent and a complete disaster on your wedding day, of course she couldn’t come and honestly, you wouldn’t have wanted her there. 

100% This. Sure, it absolutely sucks she bailed on you. And you're seeing that as a betrayal and that she should have been there, but if she WAS there? Would you have wanted someone crying, being hard to talk to? Inconsolable? If anything I see this as being her way of trying to still make the day about you. If she had come there and caused a scene or been a disaster it would have put a huge damper on your entire wedding.

To me, this is one of situations where you're not wrong for being hurt and annoyed but you being hurt and annoyed at her isn't going to solve anything. You're friends with a woman who is having some serious mental health issues and it's going to take a lot of patience. I'd hear her out after your honeymoon and feel free to tell her you're super disappointed she wasn't able to be there - emphasize that she is your best friend and you missed her presence there with you.

As for her family, I'm not sure why they chose to not come (all of them)? I would have been insisting my family go. But I'm not sure what their issue was/if they felt the need to stay with her... maybe she was threatening suicide?"

197,You could go full yolo and make up a new last name for both of you and your kids.
198,"My husband’s beard was nowhere near that long, but it reached a point that I wasn’t really a fan of. I love facial hair but I much prefer the ~1 week unshaven/scruffy look over the full mountain man look that my husband leaned towards. For me, I got through to him by pointing out that I kept my hair long for him, despite the fact that it was a bit of a pain to deal with and that it’s crazy hot in the summer. I didn’t use it in a “if you don’t start trimming, I’ll chop my hair off” sort of ultimatum, I just gently pointed out that I take his preferences into account when it comes to my appearance and I’d appreciate it if he did the same. He’s been keeping his beard maintained ever since."
199,"It almost seems like they are over compensating and under compensating at the same time.  If her family and boyfriend just cancel all plans to stay with her, they may be enabling her.  But if the issue is that serious, she needs more professional help than her family being near her anyway...."
200,"The thing I don't get is, I get women having baby fever. I don't and I am honestly a bit confused by it because it seems like your genetics is set up to make you have baby fever. Men don't seem to be set up that way. Yet I have known so many women who compromise and don't have bio-babies because their spouse is child free, or adopt because their hubby is sterile. It's the men who won't compromise on bio-babies. One of my friends got divorced for being barren. It was so heartbreaking for her that she's never even tried to date again. I have ended several relationships because I want to adopt, not have bio-babies. I'm a tocophobe, was adopted, and worked at an orphanage. I'm super invested in it. Yet dudes will assume that I will change my mind even though I'm up front about this. And I WOULD compromise, but not if they demonstrate their ignorance. If you don't know this shit is gonna tear up my vagina, permanently affect my continence, and may forever sever my stomach muscles, then you don't have the right to ask me to go through all that. I will not go through that an be disrespected, told it's all in my head, or expected to be primary carer while I am physically injured-- and if you are ignorant of pregnancy, I expect that kind of behavior. Now that I'm too old for it to be realistic, I am meeting so many 40-year old dudes that don't realize women in their late 30's cannot easily reproduce. They just take it as a given that when they're finally ready to settle down and have kids, whoever they're with will just pop them right out, no problem. I have actually told two men that they need to be dating 20-year olds because they want a relationship for a few years before they have kids. You can't play that game in your late thirties. Anyways, it's really weird and frustrating that guys are simultaneously so uncompromising and so uneducated on this subject."
201,First off no not cool and suspicious. Second...you're way more mature than your 24 year old boyfriend and you're 19.

203,"Lived in China town for months, it's a very rich part of town. A great place to go for a walk. Up and down Columbus st. A few strip clubs too. Boring ones because they can't serve alcohol. No hookers on the streets. That'd be a different part of town."

The end of this past June, right?  Just a few weeks ago?

213,"It's possible you're driving too defensively. It's hard to say since we can't see you drive, but following the law such as speed limits may make you right in the terms of legality, but a horrible driver. In CA if you're not doing 75 on the freeway you're driving to slow for the flow of traffic. The law states 65 but a cop would be more likely to pull you over vs everybody else following the flow of traffic. This is just an example it hard to say without seeing."
214,"I was engaged to a man who, after a few years, had no interest in me physically. We started dating young and were together 8 years. 
He eventually left me and I was devastated, until I realized I didn’t miss him as much as I thought I did. 
Now I’m married to man who is crazy about me. He’s always flirting with me, calling me, making sure we’re an important part of each other’s day.  
I owe my ex a thank you. If he hadn’t left, I might never have known how damn sexy and lovable I am. My ex is a good guy, but he wasn’t my guy. 
OP, you already know what to do. You’re awesome, and you’re going to be just fine. The best is yet to come."
215,"Ali is a shitty friend. I know it hurts to cut close friends off, but it didn’t seem to bother her much to cut you off when you made the *adult* decision to date someone you liked. The only positive thing is that Ali bounced back and tried to mend things with Cait, but it’s clear she hasn’t been a good friend to either of you and she seems to feed off drama. It’s not worth the negativity."
216,"Normally, I'm all for 50/50. However, if he is making 6 figures and you are struggling to make ends meet, it is extremely weird if he hasn't offered to pay more for *something* at least. It's been 3 years man.

But I wouldn't jump the gun so quickly. I think you should first talk it out with him about how you are bothered by it and why (explain your culture). If he genuinely cares about you, he should show at least some sort of understanding."
217,"&gt;She could have said she only could do the ceremony and then left during the reception. She could have sent her boyfriend or some of her family there to be an ambassador. She could have texted me more than once to apologize. There are lots of things she could have done but hasn’t.

The thing with mental illness is that no, she couldn't have stood for the ceremony, she couldn't deal with the stress of the bf going and her not going, she couldn't deal with the stress of needing to explain herself to her best friend.  So she just retracted and stayed in her little ""safe"" world.

It sucks, but it is what it is.

You are also not a bad friend.  You've been there and understood things when you needed to.  The situation is crap, but neither of you are really to blame.

I also don't blame you for being upset.  Caregiver fatigue is a thing, and I imagine being such close friends with her is leaving you with a type of caregiver fatigue.

Your friend needs professional help, not just her family and friends consistently dealing with her illness.  I don't recall you ever saying if she's in therapy or on medication.  If she isn't she needs to be.

I wouldn't blame you if you tell her that you'll be there when she needs you, but you will pull back from visiting and whatnot until she feels better and then suggest she gets help.  Then call her family and tell them that she really need help."
218,"The original comment: insensitive and rude, but probably not *intentionally* hurtful.

The mocking: fuck that. I'm not going to jump on the ""divorce"" or ""therapy"" train but that was disrespectful and needs to be addressed. Also, incredibly childish. Ask him how old he is."
219,"I think you can pretty easily clear this up just be phrasing it differently.

""Sorry, dude, the job search isn't going well and I'm stretched super thin -- can't afford a $60 buffet dinner.  A movie I can do though!"""
220,"Sounds like you perceive he's living the life of leisure while you're slaving away at the office, and you want him to pay for it."
221,"They could put it in a clock to kinda double up on its functionality, but what would you call it?"
222,"I have been on the receiving end of this. Cut it off asap. A guy told me I had the most amazing personality, but was less than average looking. He didn't want to ""let go"" of me because he ""wouldn't be able to find someone with so much chemistry again."" It destroyed my confidence and made me very insecure. It's a bit nuanced, but make it clear that you're not attracted to her, rather than her looks being objectively ugly. End it kindly, but honestly. Don't try to force a friendship either, that's her choice."
223,"You're not being a task master. You are protecting yourself from elongated involvement with someone who makes you unhappy.

Self care and selfishness are not the same thing!"
224,"Honestly, fuck these people. She could have focused on your relationship and backed off of spending time with Andrew to respect you and work on your relationship, instead she just emotionally cheated on you because she was too lazy to work on her commitments and be honest about her problems in your relationship? And this POS, after 14 years you deserved better from him too. He should have backed off no matter how he felt. Fuck both of them, I'm so sorry. She can be with him if he wants, sounds like they deserve each other, you on the other hand deserve better. Sometimes the trash takes itself out."
225,"it's almost as if they did not want to burden you on your special day, i.e. be completely NOT selfish."
226,"I have to echo what u/thedearest has said - this is really profound advice coming from experience.  
I'm really and truly sorry that you had to lose your stepmother in such a sudden way. I'm sure you were a credit to her!

And I'm sorry that your friend did that to you too.

I definitely feel myself gravitating toward putting further distance between us and leaving it all in the past."
227,"I mean, four hours in the middle of the night and a ""major history of being dishonest"" sounds like cheating to me"
228,Maybe she’s dating a cat.
229,"All of this! 

OP NONE of this is normal behavior for anyone- boyfriend OR spouse.  You have nothing to be guilty or ashamed of at all. This is not the kind of man you spend your life with."

231,"I dated the same situation! From what I last heard he never matured, has no real goals and still has a “bachelor pad” with his roommates at 37 years old. In retrospect he totally used me for my naïveté!"
232,"&gt;They keep insisting that this is my choice and that I shouldn’t choose to leave my family even though I feel as though they are the ones with the choice to accept their daughter and look past their traditional bigotry or lose their daughter.

You are right. Choose your partner."
233,Tip for everyone - get your money right before you have the move out/break up discussion.
234,Sounds like he enjoys showing off to his friends about all the randos he could be picking up. It's pretty disrespectful to you ...
235,"'Took exes phone and got in trouble' suggests to me that he tried to prevent his ex from calling 911. For better or worse, if a judge was convinced he took steps to isolate her and prevent her calling for help, that'd get him in way deeper shit than some bruises."
236,"Your husband is abusive and his behaviour is escalating. Does he yell at anyone else? Or exclusively you?

You need to leave. I know it's difficult, but this will not change, and will only continue to escalate."
237,"The prognosis for this friendship is bad. This guy seems to really lack the capacity for empathy, and doesn’t understand the role that close friendships typically have in the adult world. Eventually, you’re going to have to hurt his feelings, because what he’s asking for is ridiculous. 

Worrying about “soothing” him is the problem. He’s not going to learn to function in the real world if he can tell everyone is always trying to make him feel better about the fact that he sucks.

Planning weddings is stressful enough without supposed “friends” making things difficult. Now is the perfect time to start making things about yourself and your fiancée, and keep it that way moving forward. If he can’t understand that he’s not as important to you as you are to him, you’re going to have to cut him off probably. But maybe, just maybe, he can understand this in the context of your freaking wedding, which, super obviously, is literally about you."
238,"&gt;there has been one issue we've run into repeatedly: him wanting an extremely close friendship and me preferring just a moderately close one 

With you putting him in the wedding: is it just because he made you best man, so you're returning the favor by making him a groomsman? Because the whole post makes me wonder if you're continuing this friendship out of genuine like for the guy or if you've just known him so long you feel obligated to continue to make the motions that you're his friend.

&gt;For years I sat on the phone with him for hours every day just to avoid telling him I didn't want to talk to him as often and for as long as he wanted to talk to me.   
&gt;  
&gt;the same fundamental issue with our friendship has persisted and just continues to manifest itself in other ways   
&gt;  
&gt;he gets miffed if I don't tell other people he's my ""best"" friend and acts jealous about me spending time with other friends.   
&gt;  
&gt;The truth is that my fiancee is my best friend and I'm closer to my brother and another friend than I am to him   
&gt;  
&gt; I also hate feeling like I have to walk on eggshells around him and hate being made to feel guilty for not putting him before other people in my life that I actually feel closer to than I do him   
&gt;  
&gt; I want to be sympathetic about his feelings because I know they come from a place of hurt about our friendship being unbalanced

Like, dude. It's not a once in awhile problem of you being a bit too busy for him and just a temporary imbalance. Simply put: you're clearly not as interested in being friends as he is. You KNOW the friendship is unbalanced and said it yourself multiple times in your post. Your post also says you care for him, but nothing in there is complementary towards him.

If you actually want to keep this friendship, you're going to have to be honest with the guy about his true place in your life and what you want your place to be in his. If the friendship can't survive that frank discussion, just do the dude a favor and let the friendship go. Otherwise, it's just going to be the same cycle of you avoiding the issues you have with him and him thinking that he's one of your most important people"
239,"Also, have you noticed she's losing weight? Or is there any other weird habits around food / obsessions with food? I work with eating disorder patients and this is something we see a lot. Chewing up food and spitting it out is very common. Keeping it is also common, not sure why. There's no point in trying to rationalize something irrational. 

Obviously I'm making a massive assumption here, but if there's chewed up food up there, especially food she has ordered for herself (so clearly likes) is a sign for worry in my opinion"
240,"Protect yourself financially first and formost, do NOT lend her money.

If the relationship cannot blossom outside of you lending money theb it needs to end for a while.  That may be hard, but it is often times what sometimes people need.

When people are faced with situations where they are damn near rock bottom, they mostly succeed in pulling out of it.  So if you sont elt her get to as close to rock bottom as she can go, then you arnt helping her.

This is why you need to dostance yourself because watching her near rock bottom is difficult.  She needs to ""pull up"" on her own."
241,"Of course you’re not comfortable. He wrecked any chance that you might be. 

Molly may make you absently caress someone. Not between their legs. And he was pretty quick to know why you walked away, no? There was some intent. 

Look, it’s kind of insulting that he’s actually trying the “independence is important to me” when you’re not asking him to give anything up lol. Hey, that gal you felt up last time? Maybe skip this 1:1 trip that will put you in the same position. 

Are they going just them?? Or as a group?"
242,It's Reddit. Jumping to conclusions on relationship advice is simply the norm on here.
243,"You will never see a penny of that money.

But. Now you know. Do not give her one more cent. Not one."
244,"&gt; Either you make one last ditch effort and say “our relationship is in jeopardy here &amp; it is important that you make time for me to talk”.


&gt; I told him that he absolutely is de-prioritizing it, he said, ""No I'm not and you can think what you want

Just end it over text now. SO's response to OP's valid comment was a bit of gas-lighting instead of acknowledging OP's very valid feelings. SO will just continue to excuse his behavior, even if he finally makes it to a face-to-face conversation."
245,"Well, she sounds like a trainwreck.

With little little kids like you have, I’d recommend marriage counseling before calling it quits.

You’ve said nothing on what you’ve done to combat this? It sounds like you’ve acquiesced to every demand she’s made. 

Have you ever said “no, we won’t go on a trip” or “no, our 1 year old party budget is $300”"
246,"I would confront her about it, but be sure to talk to her as her boyfriend and not a doctor or therapist - I say this because there's a comment on here recommending you speak to a doctor before confronting her. Don't do that, doctors are doctors and boyfriends are boyfriends. They shouldn't overlap. 

Let her know about the food you have found, and gently ask her if she struggles with meals, you can tell her you've noticed that she doesn't tend to finish her dinners. Make sure not to accuse her of having an eating disorder or certain habits, just ask her instead. Make sure she knows you won't judge her and stuff, just let her know you're there and want to help."
247,"Nah. I’m from SF and would find it really weird for a tourist to venture to Chinatown where everything closes at 7 PM. It’s not really where the nightlife is either, it’s mainly touristy shops and restaurants. In regards to bars they’re only open until 2.  I think if he wanted to explore the area he would’ve realized there’s literally nothing  to do and turned around."
248,Document everything and lawyer up. Seriously. His conduct is disgusting and abusive and the company is enabling it. Plenty of attorneys would take a case like this on contingency because the settlement could be substantial.
249,"The aggressive persuit bothers me more than the age gap. I had a similar age gap relationship (in case anyone is wondering, his issue was immaturity) and we were together until I outgrew him basically. That you feel the need to be asking us wierdos tells me your guy is unlike mine, follow your instincts and find a different man. Your instincts will rarely let you down so long as your normal meter isn't broken, and I don't think yours is."
250,"Same here.  It destroyed me to hear him tell me “I’m used to dating super attractive girls, you’re so funny and interesting it’s weird”. Like... thanks, i guess?  I’m happily married now to a man who finds me irresistible, so please let this lady go and find someone who will appreciate all of her.  And please please please do not mention not finding her physically attractive."
251,That's awesome. My husband is an atheist as well. We've been together almost 10 years and have 2 kids.
252,"I'd agree, and I say that as a Christian who lives in the South! It's not simply being a Christian that's a problem when it comes to a relationship with someone who doesn't share your beliefs-- it's definitely the hardcore/fundie part of it that's the issue, and the lack of ability to meet halfway. I'm one of those ""Jesus loved everyone and didn't judge anyone, so we should too"" people, i.e I strongly support LGBT rights and reproductive rights, and I always keep an open mind about my beliefs and about how they affect my family life. For people who can't or won't do that, they're gonna have a problem in any relationship-- romantic or otherwise-- with someone who's not exactly like them."
253,"Yeah my ex did this. When he felt something was wrong suddenly all plans would be canceled, he doesn’t feel good/too busy. Won’t pick up the phone... so I just showed up to tell him. I only showed up because last time he dumped me but wouldn’t let me get my stuff! He “didn’t want me out of his life, he’d miss me too much.” I was not about to go through that circus again.

Some people just can’t handle the confrontation that a relationship isn’t working."
254,"Thanks guys. i'll try the banging on the wall lol and if he doesn't get the hint, i'll just be a little more up front."
255,"Oh wow! Reading this made me sad. You should never compromise what you really want just to stay with someone. The only time an open relationship is healthy, is when both parties are 100%confident in their relationship. I see why you are saying what you are but honestly that will be much harder than it is right now(and it’s hard right now). Think about him saying I’m going out with my coworkers  and I may just stay the night with “Jill”. How would you feel? That is what it would be like. You are more valuable and worthy of love than you even know, regardless of your stretch marks or other body “issues” you may have. Please don’t open this door for him you will regret it! Is counseling an option?"
256,"I said the exact same thing to him. If it was long ago, okay maybe that can be gotten through.. but right, literally going through divorce while we’ve already been together a year.. takes it to a whole new level.

But i agree, if I were to decide to try and push on with this, it would for sure take therapy and many years to get back to where we were. The trust is so far gone after this, it’s breaking me up inside to think, even if we try for years, I may never actually get over it."
257,"It’s not like she was calling you names or saying anything unforgivable about you, she’s allowed to feel like you were being condescending and she should be allowed to talk those feelings out with someone.    
Sounds like you thought the issue was resolved when you two compromised on what to do for the day, but she was still upset about how it was handled. Talk to her and find out what she was upset about and what you two can do to better resolve those issues in the future.   
    
Edit: also I think if you want to have a productive conversation about it you’re going to need to drop the “I’m the worst girlfriend ever” thing. I get that you feel guilty, but it makes it so that she has to reassure you about your behavior rather than actually being able to talk to you about the issue"
258,This!! There is NO shame in separate rooms. People act like it’s the hallmark of a terrible relationship. It’s literally only the hallmark of two people who love each other but have different sleeping habits.
259,"18 years together, and my husband has never so much as raised his voice to me in anger, let alone call me names and break my property. You're right, I'm going to call your relationship shit. I'm also going to tell you that your assumption that everyone is a little bit shitty is incorrect. I think you tell yourself this so that you don't have to face that you're in an abusive relationship.

I also think you deserve more. You deserve better. You should speak to a therapist about your self worth issues if you think you don't.

But let me ask you this. Say your best friend wrote this to you, asking for your advice. He treats her so terribly, and she's asking you what she should do. What do you tell her? 

Is this really the life you want? Is this really what you think love looks like? Don't you think you deserve more?"
260,His hand was on her thigh... If she is going to think your relationship is weak in that regard then... She already knows lol
261,"&gt; I'm not allowed to follow her on my main account because my boyfriend wants to keep me a secret from her

Yeah, gee, why would he want that ..."
262,"right?!? 

If my partner woke me up at 4 to call me a slut and ask me about some sexts from highschool he'd be DUMPED af"
263,Exactly! He made his priorities known and OP wasn't one of them.
264,"I have faced the same problem as you. I went in with the best intentions, looks doesn’t matter, her personality is amazing, etc. and while we did have a great relationship, over time it became a bigger and bigger problem. 

She had mental illnesses that made me stay too. The guilt of her being destroyed by a break up made me stay. While I genuinely did love her, i had to leave. Once I did, she did break down, eventually her sadness turned to hatred and she said some spiteful things towards me. I had to block her on literally everything to get her to stop.

Then she started dating my cousin. She’s fine now. You see? She. Will. Be. Fine. Just like you. You have a good heart my man, but the right thing to do is to rip the band aid now before she gets deeper and deeper into this relationship. You’re not a bad guy for leaving someone that you’re unattached too. If anything, it’s worse to stay with someone and give them hope. I hope this helps, my friend."
265,"I agree with you but ease off the ""How are you so confused?"" schtick - it's a really tough thing to process that someone so close to you isn't trustworthy. Things are rarely clear when you are in the middle of them, and even if you spot things, there is still a huge internal pressure to ignore or explain away anything suspicious. 

People need to be heard, not made to feel dumb."
266,"I am thinking he just cheated on her, and wants to launch his missiles first before she finds out anything.

She will be scrambling now, just to try and smooth things over...meaning she is not looking for the things she should be looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever someone tells me their SO has logged into ANY of their accounts, the reaction IMMEDIATELY is to ask for the SAME access to their phone, and any social media. Which they will not get, because the SO has something to hide...."
267,Naw this is why you don't have kids at all
268,I can’t get past the fact they live in LA. She has a serious case of keeping up with the Joneses...or the Kardashians.
269,"&gt;I know how immature this must sound,

It does to me because you are basically saying that you are willing to throw away this...

&gt;I love this woman, and the thought of not being with her feels devastating. I align with her on so many key areas -- personal values, future goals / ambitions, wanting children, how we treat each other in the relationship in terms of emotional support and giving each other personal space, and so on.

Just so you can be with someone who will party late with you a couple times a year when you hang out with your HS / College buddies.  

&gt;won't be seen as ""cool""

It's very sad that you would consider throwing away a healthy relationship out of fear of looking ""cool"".  Dude, you are 33 years old.  Where's your maturity?   If your ""need for approval"" is this strong then you need to get some therapy for it.  I guarantee it will sink other areas of your life in addition to sinking your relationship if you can't deal with it."
270,Do not get involved in other people's divorces.
271,"This OP, I've also experienced it first hand. Get out now and don't let him emotionally blackmail his way back in!"
272,"Never ever propose with explicitly talking about marriage. A proposal should never, ever be a surprise. You need to make sure that both of you are on the same page before you ever even think about proposing."
273,"Your mom accidentally blurted out a racist thought, felt humiliated by what it revealed about her, and turned that humiliation into rage in order to soothe herself at your expense. 

It wasn’t about you at all. This was 100% about your mother’s own cognitive dissonance and discomfort. You just happened to be an unfortunate witness to her ugly side. Worse, you’re her child - a lot of adults can’t *stand* the notion that their kids might be more knowledgeable/“enlightened” than they are, or that their kids might judge them as morally lacking or dated in their thinking. It’s seriously galling to the ego. Now that you know that your mom reacts like this to being judged (whether real or imagined), you know what you’re signing up for by living with her. Whenever your mom feels embarrassed/exposed, she’s gonna lash out at the witnesses. 

I recommend moving out as soon as possible."
274,"I personally would feel uncomfortable if my girlfriend was doing any one on one activity with a guy she had just met in a bar. I think most guys would. It's basically just a random guy. If your boyfriend met some random girl in a bar and Australia and invited her to spend the day with him doing some activity, would you think that was cool?"
275,"Right? That last text OP sent already sounds like a dump text to me. OP, you tried. Nothing more you can do except start the process of moving on. &lt;3"
276,"How unattractive are we talking about here? And have you examined whether your standards for female attractiveness are reasonable (i.e.: are the women you are attracted to about on par with your own attractiveness level and are you able to ignore biological factors outside of anyone's control, like minor cellulite or a few visible pores)? 

It would be a shame to give up something incredible over a standard that can't *ever* be attained by any average woman. If it's something only a computer can create in a photo editing suite then you should look into getting some help as you will *never* find anyone who meets those standards. 

Many of the comments here are assuming that you have a reasonable preference in women and that this person is legitimately unattractive, but there are also some who become acclimated to a level of false perfection that is impossible to find outside of their consumed media. 
If that could be you then this issue may just be the start to a lifelong cycle of dissatisfaction as all women will prove to be flawed when compared to manipulated imagery in mass media. 

However, if you legitimately find many average women attractive in real life as you go about your day and she is just not it for you then you likely want to keep looking."
277,"Girl, I thought this was going to be about rent money. Your boyfriend makes 6 figures and won't buy you dinner? Say that out loud. Jesus christ, he's an asshole.

And honestly, not that you asked, but if you have been together for 3 years and splitting the dinner bill is an issue in your relationship, are you sure this person even sees a future with you? This the type of problem that arises amongst friends, not partners."
278,"I mean a divorce is the obvious answer, you are being abused and hate your life. You say he’s a “good dad” but you probably already know a good dad wouldn’t act this way in front of their child, and just to give you a preview, as soon as your kid is old enough to start thinking for herself, he’s going to to turn her into a target for this as well. You may be willing to lay down and waste your life for his sake, but are you willing to put her through the same?"
279,"The point is, you told your husband about it &amp; didn't lie. That's not what op's bf did."
280,I prefer his way. Less aggressive.
281,"Why are you leaping to her needed a job.....instead of you know, budgeting??????  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm the oldest of 5 kids.....5 is alot.  And you have a 4 year old.  It's pretty easy to get an idea of what she ""does all day"".  Who would look after the 4 year old while she's working?  My guess is any job that she could get after being out of the workforce for 16 years wouldn't even make a dent in childcare!"
282,"Like the others said, don't act until you know. But, if he does test positive then I would see if he has a plan of any sort (assisted living, hospice, etc) for the end of life stage instead of being completely dependant on you. However, it's your decision if you can emotionally handle knowing your time with someone will be shorter than expected. 

It might be silly to think of it this way, but there's always a possibility of something bad happening to your partner. They could get in a terrible accident or get dementia. With this, you know for sure and have a time line. There's also the chance that 20 years in the future there will be better treatments for this. 

Another thing to consider is that the relationship is still early. If he tests positive and you decide to stay, things may not work out for a different reason and you may break up regardless. But if you stay, I'd advise establishing a strong support system, making sure you still have your own life while being with him, and actively have a plan with him for what both of you would want when he is afflicted."
283,"You take that back!

By ""that"", I mean the ""jk""."
284,"I agree. The wedding was clearly too much stress for this person from the start, and they didn’t want to disappoint, but ultimately couldn’t do it."
285,"&gt; I don’t want to lose his friendship 

**He isn't your friend.**  

He wants to fuck you.

His ""friendship"" will consist of hanging out with you and waiting for you to change your mind, i.e., Nice Guyville.  He doesn't want your friendship, he wants access to your vagina.  You will quickly discover that ""friendship"" looks a lot like ""dating,"" with an added fuckton of guilting and gaslighting from him.

Drop him and don't look back."
286,"I know you’re impressed by his ring efforts right now, but wait and see if that changes, or if his efforts start to wane.  He might just be dangling a carrot in front of you to keep you around.  

But main question - if you guys have had talks to get married by 27 and it hasn’t happened - what was the reason for that?  And what is the reason to wait another 2 years, especially when you say that everything else in life is happy and stable?  Perhaps he’s not ready to get married yet, but if that’s the case, has he communicated that to you?  No one should feel pressured to get married but he has to be honest about his thoughts on marriage with you. It would suck if you’re waiting around for him to be ready without even knowing if that’s the reason. Marriage isn’t for everyone and that’s fine - but everyone has to be on the same page. 


My friend is in a similar situation and her bf “knows a lot about rings”!!  Its been 24 years of waiting, 8 which have passed since she brought up weddings and rings. When she starts kicking up a fuss and getting upset that no proposal has happened, he will wine and dine her to make her feel better, maybe do another ring shopping trip.  But she still hangs around."
287,"her overspending is one thing, but the fact she belittles you like this is a whole 'nother thing. this isnt a type of behavior your kids should have to be exposed to either. seek couples counseling if you two haven't planned to already. if she makes no attempt to change things for the better, then i would consider divorce as the last resort.

in the long run, it's better for the kids to have to split their time in two separate but happier homes than under one toxic one.

sorry you're going through this :("
288,"&gt;And she said ""stuff doesn't really make me happy, Ive got what I need here and I don't really care to buy more things for the sake of buying. I don't spend much time here anyway.""  
&gt;  
&gt;I asked her if it wouldn't be nicer to have a more comfortable place, and she just said that she didn't care, it wasn't worth the money to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, this sounds pretty clear to me. She's not there very much and doesn't care to throw money into making it prettier. Are you more of a homebody than she is?"
289,Exactly this. She thinks J is controlling because that’s what you’re telling her. You’re not owning your choices and decisions.
290,Why don’t you tell her to be retested?
291,I can tell that you are the farthest thing from a bad friend. It’s totally understandable to be upset. It sounds like she needs some serious serious help.
292,"I dated a guy like this when I was around your age. He put basically everything in his life ahead of our relationship and then made me feel crazy when I’d point it out. The fact that you had an argument about him not prioritizing you and he reacted to that by not prioritizing the conversation about it multiple times tells you all you need to know, IMO. He couldn’t even be bothered to set an alarm?

Also, this week it’s band practice. Next week it’ll be something else and so on and so forth."
293,"The dog just pooped on the carpet - in a house that's on fire.  First things first, get into AA today, not at some point this week.  Today.  

Secondly get yourself into therapy as soon as possible.  

You are dealing with both a personal crisis and a relationship crisis but you can't even begin to deal with the relationship crisis until you have taken some steps on the personal one.  With the guidance of your therapist you can however develop a quick short term plan for the relationship crisis, and then a more medium term plan once you have been sober a while."
294,"How are you going to say you’re not the side chick when you don’t even know he’s gone on vacation out of the COUNTRY?

Look. It doesn’t matter if you’re living together. Plenty of people have double lives. 

It seems as if your boyfriend is one of them."
295,"&gt;&gt;When I asked if he had called the phone company yet, his response was, ""Do you really think I would cheat on you?""

And there you go. Totally evading the question. If I hadn't cheated, I would do everything within my power to prove my innocence, and your bf is not doing that and is instead punting this to you. I'm really sorry you're going through this. I could forgive someone for a cheating slip-up, but not someone lying to my face like that."
296,"Well, yeah. If someone is having issues, the last thing they want to do is ruin someone else’s day with them. 

I understand your disappointment. But I don’t think she was just being inconsiderate or selfish. I think she has Shit Going On."
297,"Have your husband tell them to stop asking, and make sure he does it in a way that is for both of you and not just throwing you under the bus."
298,Yessssss yes yes I'm so glad this turned out without him cheating...........YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
299,"This sounds like a budget problem more than anything else to me.

I'm currently a SAHM, we budget every dollar.  This means we both have an allowance we can spend, no questions asked.  We use an online bank that allows many free savings accounts which for us is like an envelope system. A certain amount goes for allowances, contingency, eating out, groceries, everything, even haircuts.  

If she isn't willing to work right now, discuss a budget together.  There can be room for daily starbucks or whatever, but she needs to know what the tradeoffs are.

I (~35 yo f, haven't worked in 8ish years) personally have a 4 yo who is starting preschool this year.  I've recently applied to be a preschool aid and if that doesn't happen, I will volunteer (with the preschool and my daughter's school) to regain confidence and references. I off ramped myself to be a sahm after earning a Master's and the struggle is real.

You might ask her if she'd be interested in volunteering with the PTA or something as a start."
300,"If she is in a psychosis she may not even remember everything that is going on now. 

Sounds you have done all you could and she is in the best place for her. If her family is taking over once she gets released maybe just take a step back and reach out or write to her while once she gets a bit more like herself. With treatment and therapy hopefully she can recover but I would assume while she is still is a danger to herself and possibly others she will not get released but I guess that depends on where you live. What a tough place to be in, seeing someone you love going through this."
301,She is officially prescribed anti-depressants and Adderall but on her birthday she was drinking heavily and taking edibles. I had asked her to not take adderall that day since we were day drinking and she gets loopy when she does adderall and drinks. I think the lack of a stimulant made her fall asleep early. But also she was drinking more heavily than i was and taking more edibles than i was - it was definitely kind of alarming so I told her boyfriend about it and he said he'd handle it. Looking back i should have told her parents but I didn't want to be an alarmist when she's an adult and was celebrating her birthday.
302,Don’t distance yourself slowly. Cut her off. She’s pure trash 😡 A decisive cut is the only thing that will convince your BF as well.
303,He’s clearly not ready to live with a woman.  He may want to live elsewhere until he is ready to fully accept the realities of female anatomy.
304,"People who try to imply that their cheating was not ""that bad"" because they were finding out about their sexuality have an unhealthy, selfish, and warped view of boundaries, respect, and trust. 

The key points are: 

* She cheated on you in an altered state and continued cheating afterwards. She should be asking for your forgiveness, not finding excuses related to the gender of the person she cheated with. 
* She is now leveraging your existing emotional commitment to her and this relationship so that you will accept a modification. All this without consulting you and seemingly without caring about your feelings on the matter at all.
* You cannot enter an open relationship agreement with someone where trust is not 100%. You need to trust that your partner will abide to your pre-set rules regardless of *anything*. Her past behaviour makes it sound like she will bend and reshape the rules as she pleases to mitigate her future wrongs.

Has she apologised? If not, why hasn't she? Even without calling it ""cheating"", she went against your agreement to be exclusive. She should at the veeeery least apologise to you.

If not, you really need to be firm and tell her that what she did was wrong and that she needs to realise it. If she doesn't, there is no future in this relationship.

Let her talk about her reasons for wanting an open relationship. If she is *certain* and really **certain** that this is the only way forward for her, she needs to think about it, be specific and lay out what she envisions. No compromise or new relationship configuration should be entered unless both of you are 100% on board with the terms.

If you don't want an open relationship, which is **absolutely okay**. You can understand openness with your brain (""Yeah, I guess it makes sense that one single person can't give you literally everything you might ever need"" etc), but still not want it emotionally. It doesn't make you less open-minded, it just makes you a person with feelings.

As a last point, claiming that, for a girl, hooking up with girls is somewhat ""less"" than hooking up with guys is actually inherently homophobic. It's insulting to everyone out there who has an exclusive homosexual relationship and if she is, indeed, bisexual, she needs to revisit her attitude on this topic or she will fall prey to the devaluation of her FF connections, if she ever has any (example: ""I have a girlfriend"" means nothing to guys who think that girlxgirl relationships don't count).

She clearly is still finding out about herself, she's 18 and that's normal. But it's not respectful for her to drag you into her discoveries, to not consult you or care about your feelings, and to excuse her cheating. Consider breaking up unless she shows some sense."
305,"Wow, she obviously doesn't have a real concept of what it is to be pregnant and the responsibility and cost of a newborn (speaking as someone who is currently 4.5 months pregnant).

This sounds similar to women who get so caught up in having a wedding that they aren't thinking about the marriage. She's so focused on having a baby because ""everyone else is doing it"" that she's being completely unrealistic."
306,He’s also very embarrassing. I’m all for memes but sending the same one multiple times is boring and it’s not even a good one.
307,"A time chime, because it would play some sort of sound at a specific time?"
308,"There's nothing wrong with eating out. They make enough money that they're still saving, moreso her. But I agree about the late dinners. It makes me feel like crap if I'm eating dinner that late; especially if it's greasy discount bar food. If I'm eating out that night I will happily pay more for something more healthy than pizza and beer."
309,"Yeah, North Beach is right there. Strip clubs and late night gambling dens. People down in that area at that time are there to party."
310,"This is a good point.  They've been married since she was 20.  The likelihood of her having zero understanding of finances is pretty high especially if OP's done it all and ""sheltered"" her from it.

Communication is very much needed in OP's situation."
311,He probably has a girlfriend honestly
312,"I'm sorry but this is all so sketchy. If he had a history of doing dumb stuff I'd be more inclined to believe it was innocent, but what 26 year old guy tattoos a wedding ring on his finger for a girlfriend of 7 months?? That is insane. I've only just noticed you're long distance, how often do you see eachother?"
313,"As a 26 year old who definitely see’s 18 year olds as children, it is pretty gross,
Most people go for those much younger for the power dynamic, id stay well away"
314,"Wow. Now that I think about it she does have some odd eating habits, but I've never thought about it before. She never finishes her meals but I always thought she was just someone who does not eat a lot. She is tiny but also 5""2.....Maybe she has lost a bit of weight, but I honestly couldn't say for sure. Would confronting her about how this is common eating disorder behavior be wise?"
315,"It sure is, but I fail to see the humor in punching her down when her feelings are hurt"
316,"If you are the only people she knows who would even *consider* taking her cats in for an entire year, and she didn’t even bother asking you until her trip was already booked, she clearly doesn’t care all that much about what happens to those cats when she leaves. 

If she’d rather take this voluntary trip than retain ownership of her cats, it’d be best for everyone if they’re permanently rehomed."
317,"I personally do not value monogamy, but when I date monogamous people, I value the monogamous relationship I am building with them, and it never even occurs to me to violate that.  I strongly value following agreed-upon relationship boundaries.  Plenty of people claim to value monogamy, but only really want it of their partner and cheat instead.  It sounds like your wife may not value monogamy, but she was (it sounds like) fully within the bounds of her past relationship.  If she values the monogamous relationship you have built together more than sleeping around (which is how I feel) then she's going to be faithful."
318,While it’s ultimately his choice I think you are well within your rights to tell him that it’s affecting your attraction to him and your sex life. Obviously it might be a touchy subject if he has spent so much time but there is definitely a compromise somewhere between barefaced and a 1 foot long beaded and braided beard.
319,"Seconded.  

One of the most powerful things anyone has ever said to me, a woman who has struggled with serious self-image issues, was my brother turning to me and saying quite fiercely, “Hey!  Don’t talk about my sister like that!”

As if I was talking smack about a third party.  It really brought what I was saying into focus.  

And you know, it has been almost a decade since he said that to me, and I still hear that echo in my head every time I begin to degrade myself.  *Don’t you talk about my sister like that*."
320,"Girl you are paying this guys bills and he’s leaving work early? Hell no. You’re right, it’s not fair...but, frankly, you’ve done it to yourself. You need to stop supporting him...at 24 he should be able to handle his own business by now."
321,"How long have they been FWB?

&gt;According to her he was her rebound and emotional support.

Sex + Emotional support?  Sounds like a relationship to me.

How long before you got together did they stop?  A day?  A week?  Any overlap?"
322,"You sound like a pain to date. There's literally nothing wrong, you're just conjuring up ghosts for whatever reason."
323,"They are obviously taking advantage of you. Its not your responsibility to permanently babysit their child. Babysitters, like most things in life, are temporary. 

It's time for you to move on, unless you need the $6 an hour."
324,Absolutely! I would ideally like to use non-latex ones.
325,Yep. This dude is a coward for not being upfront until it’s too late.
326,"The drinking while on benzos is an absolute no no. For the sake of whatever friendship you guys have left, I strongly encourage setting boundaries with regards to no drinking at least while in your presence. A friend doesn't condone kind of destabilizing environment. 

That said, you're now learning that your friends mental health is quite possibly more severe than initially thought, or like you said that it has been misidentified or mismanaged to this point. Her family being in the healthcare industry means not a damn. I've seen plenty of educated family make snap decisions because there is an inherent bias. 

I recommend like others have mentioned and don't come to rely on her as a close friend but also don't attack her or attempt to apply ""normal"" logic to someone with mental health issues. My guess would be either BP1 or BP2 that is being incorrectly managed and or treated. You can't even begin to understand the  *why's* when it comes to decision making when it comes to Bipolar Disorder. 

As a boyfriend (and as your case a friend) the best we can do is be there for them, set firm boundaries, and try not to apply too much of ""our"" logic. Not carefully worked on, relationships are destroyed and it appears that is what your friend is doing whether she is aware of it or not."
327,That’s not your problem though.
328,"He's cheating on you, the next step in what to do is simple....leave. But if you do decide to stay, know he fucked his ex."
329,"Regardless of if he deserves it or not, if you don't trust him you shouldn't be with him. He does seem to be pretty sketchy so I would trust my instincts on this one."
330,"Your bf shouldn't have to leave his place because of one man's jealousy (let's not call it ""discomfort""), but if he has offered, why not take him up on it? You can spend the whole weekend with her, and she won't have to drive back late that night. You don't have hope of finding out what's going on with her unless you keep flexible and stay in contact with her. It will be telling if her husband finds a new reason for her not to come, now that your bf is out of your place for the weekend."
331,"^^^^^^^^
&gt;Everything about your post says that you really &gt;aren't that into this guy.

&gt;That should be enough.

This. There is no rule that you have to date someone just because they really want to date you.

Also, OP, being 18 and wanting to have fun isn’t flighty. It’s normal. You’re 18. You have your whole life to date 26 yr olds but just one year to be 18.

Party (responsibly), experiment (safely), and live your best life! Don’t waste it on someone trying to recapture his teens. That’s gross."
332,That would be a hard no from me.  He is being a douche
333,Consider an abortion asap and get tested for stds. Your health is priority.
334,"Hiya, seconding the Lundy Bancroft rec, it’s great. You should be able to find it for free online, but if you have any trouble I’d be happy to send you the ebook version, please feel free to DM me.

Your husband is being absolutely abusive and deeply inappropriate and you do *not* have to put up with it."
335,It isn't even omission... She has asked multiple times and he kept saying no and that she was rediculous to think they might have been married!
336,"&gt; It's also possible that he was feeling suffocated by your previous behavior

Caveat: it's also fully possible *he's irrationally* feeling suffocated by fairly standard intimacy, but has personal hangups that don't allow for real intimacy. 

Again, this doesn't change that OP would learn this best by trying clear communication and seeing how he responds will speak volumes."
337,Dude you're not invited because you are the weird 26 year old dating a 20 year old.  If you try to stop her she will just break up with you.
338,"OP may well be mature for her age, she sounds pretty self-aware, TBH. But agreed that guys who use ""mature"" as a come-on are almost invariably extremely immature for their ages and trying to allay their insecurities."
339,"If you're going to leave your husband, do it because you don't want to be married anymore. Don't do it with the hopes you can bang someone else."
340,"Just read both posts. 

You sound like you want the status of being married, but I don’t see anything about marrying *him* in particular. The only traits about him you describe are how he procrastinates, doesn’t put in effort to the relationship, and has verbally expressed that he’s not ready for marriage. Why do you want to marry him?? What about him makes a great lifetime partner?

Yes, you can tick the marriage box and tick the kids box with him, but will that make your life feel satisfying and complete?

Say hello to your next 60 years of Reddit posts: We plan to get fertility treatment, but my husband says he’s not ready yet. My husband won’t make the effort to schedule doctor appts for our kids, says he forgets. My husband hasn’t taken me on a date or done anything romantic since our wedding night ten years ago..."
341,"I’m gonna be honest, that fact that you’re pretty steadfast on wanting her wearing your necklace at all times strikes me as being a bit off at first. I’m not saying that you’re actively trying to be overly possessive, I really don’t think it’s active at all or even registering with you. But if someone was so bent on me wearing their jewelry to the point where I’m now panicking trying to figure out when I can wear a gift from my own father, I’d be uncomfortable immediately. I think in my personal opinion you need to stop trying to figure out how you can make it so she’s only wearing yours, and step back to examine the reasons behind you being so gung ho with it. It’s just a necklace, it’s a small red flag that it can cause such an issue for you two."
342,"You can (and thank you for offering your advice respectfully), but until I have a lot more information I’m not going to just ditch him and run. 

It’ll be a LONG time before I allow him contact with me, my kids, and even longer before I’ll give him a chance to be back in the home but this situation isn’t an automatic divorce."
343,"You are totally justified. In fact, I wouldn't even bother breaking up via text. Just ghost, invoke the Cone of Silence™ and call it done. When he finally notices and tries to get back in touch with you, just tell him you got distracted with other things in your life and forgot to break up officially. Then he'll know how it feels to be so unimportant in someone's life that she can't even be bothered to break up with him."
344,"*And everywhere else, she's so well put together, so well dressed and her desk was always organized and cute at work, with lots of little personal touches.*

Sounds like you set up expectations that she'd be some kind of Suzy homemaker and she didn't live up to that. 

You're massively overthinking this. It doesn't seem like she's living in filth. It sounds like she told you the truth. She doesn't care about buying lots of stuff and decorating when she's never home. She has other priorities with her money.

This doesn't mean she's not put together. This doesn't mean she's not 'pretty' anymore. She's just not perfect, and that seems to bother you for some reason that you might want to analyze for yourself."
345,It's entirely appropriate to block someone who's abusing you over text. It's even more appropriate to break it off with someone who treats you so badly.
346,"That's way out there.  I don't even know where to start.  If you want to have kids, this is not the guy for you so make your decision now."
347,Do not convert to a religion you do not believe in. It's a bad decision for you and frankly insulting to the religious group. This is really your girlfriend's decision. You cannot convert to a religion you don't believe in so she can decide if her relationship or her parents' approval is more important to her.
348,omg same lol i read this and was like..... is this my bf!?!??!?
349,"You said she's on meds and is seeing a therapist. That IS getting help for her condition, it's just not getting fixed at the rate you think it should. Mental health is incredibly complicated and issues can take YEARS to heal. Even then, it will always be a struggle. This is something she will be dealing with for the rest of her life. Hopefully she'll learn the tools to get through things and take it day by day."
350,"*&gt; as punishment she would have me write 4 pages of ""I will not be late for class*

What the fuck 

My understanding is that D/s is about providing a well defined space for partners to experiment with submission/domination dynamics while maintaining the feeling of safety &amp; intimacy for both partners.

Here it sounds like she’s just using it as a cover to have some power trip over you.

How long until you have enough money saved up to move out? Is there a friend or family member whom you trust that you could crash with in the meantime?"
351,You need to cut both people out of your life completely. They are toxic and verbally abusive. Don’t get sucked in by her being sweet.
352,"I (20F) was with a guy (20m) for 4 years that couldn't even stand the thought that I had ever been with anyone before him. I couldnt mention anything that had happened in my past without it resulting in an argument. I caught him snooping through my messages frequently and it really shattered all trust between us. He once found messages I had sent to another guy months before I had even met him and he was so mad about it. He frequently accused me of cheating. But his double standards were sickening. He would get mad if I ever suggested going through his messages or if I hinted towards not trusting him, but I couldn't do anything without him knowing. I left him about 6 months ago because he couldn't get over any of his own issues. That sort of insecurity and selfishness is dangerous and will drain you of all freedom, independence, and trust you might think you have right now."
353,That is why the sort of people who are inclined to travel for extended periods of time traditionally avoid getting pets until they've gotten that out of their system. Not your problem.
354,"I think a modified version of what you wrote here would work. 
""I know we are working through a huge tragedy right now. I'm trying my best to support you and your emotional needs, but the tank is starting to run low and I am going to need to lean on you a little here. I'm scared that this event has changed how you feel about me and, if that's not the case, I'm hoping that you could find some ways to show me that you still care."" Then give him examples of things that would make you feel appreciated.

I went through something similar, though not precipitated by tragedy. I was feeling like my husband didn't love me at all because he wouldn't just *do* things that would make me smile. I had to learn that men oftentimes aren't raised in the same way that women were, where they are always on the look out for ways to satisfy emotional needs. This is a skill that has to be practiced. So, tell him how you're feeling and find ways to help him practice. At the beginning, I had to give my husband a list of things that I liked (I absolutely hated spelling it out, but once he learned, the list was gone). Be patient because it's a skill we have learned over our lives and he has less time to practice. 

Hope that helps."
355,"Ask your boyfriend, based on his assessment, how do couples go on to have 2, 3, 4+ kids? People do not stop having sex past a certain age, the rates of STDs and STI's in nursing homes and assisted living facilities will tell you that much."
356,"He may not be able to get transcripts of texts, but he certainly can get a printout that proves if he texted her or not. He can also get location data from his phone whether had that feature enabled or not. Quiet as it's kept, your past location can always be verified on your phone ., if you had your phone on you.

Texts and even pics can be faked, but everything on his end cannot without some serious tinkering going on by someone with a high level of tech expertise. And even that shows tracks, so. Unless she's a really, really, really, *really* good hacker all he has to do is show you his text history on his phone, get proof from the cell provider, and also proof as to if he went to her apartment and if there, how long he stayed over. 

There *are* people so spiteful and malicious that they would try to torch someone else's relationship with claims of cheating, but again a lie falls apart when they person lied on has irrefutable proof."
357,"&gt; We have 4 school age children and one 4 yr old. So when schools back in session she will just have the one at home.

*We have 4 school age children and one 4 yr old.*

**We have 4 school age children and one 4 yr old.**

Your wife already has a full-time job. Yes, even when they're in school.

Maybe you guys need to have a conversation about reeling in expenses, but you're not going to get real far saying, ""get a job."""
358,"If not, he has some serious paranoia problems."
359,"alternatively, your loving actions were keeping an insecurity at bay. now that you're focusing more on yourself he's suddenly very insecure with what you're doing when you're not with him so he's coming on to you much more to ensure you're happy and dont want to leave him.


i say this as a guy that acted almost exactly like your bf did for the first 5 years of my relationship with my wife. i got sick of feeling like such a pussy and went to therapy for a few years. life changing personally and for our marriage."
360,"Yuppp!!! He may be your best friend but youre clearly not his. That’s not a line that men cross, there are millions of girls and he picks yours? Yeah I don’t think so, I’d distance my self from both of them."
361,"I feel you. I was in a very similar situation. For the year we dated he treated me 1 dinner for my birthday. I am still in school and living off of loans while he was a senior engineer at Apple. Never treated me to anything, even if we were getting ice cream he would just suggest to pay and then that I venmo him for my ice cream. It was hurtful not feeling like I am worth the $2 for an ice cream, especually when he makes 6 figures. 

Now I am dating someone else and as soon as the conversation of living together was brought up he insisted that we split rent 70/30 until I graduate and get a job so I contribute more. I almost cried. The difference in attitudes is enormous and made me feel like we are partners who support eachother, rather than each to its own."
362,"&gt;Partners of mine have felt 100% comfortable:
* washing them
* folding them
* taking out trash with used menstrual products
* having period sex

I shared a living space with a 19-20 year old dude in the past and he was absolutely aware I menstruate (gasp!), including buying me tampons when I'd run out and throwing panties that had blood leakage in the washer. OPs dude sucks."
363,"&gt; I think she’s acting way too urgently. 

Dude your dad forced a kiss on another woman then drunkely texted her until 2am. What is the question here?"
364,Has he made any attempt to apologize for his reaction?
365,"maybe send him one last text.  ""i know you're upset and shocked by everything that happened.  i am, too.  just know that as far as i'm concerned, YOU are my father.  i love you, and nothing will change that.  please call me when you're ready, and i understand that might take a while.  i'll be here when you're ready to talk.""

give him some space, allow him to sort this out for a while.  also seconding the recommendation for finding someone to talk to yourself.  it doesn't have to be a therapist, though that would be best.  if you go to church, maybe talk to your pastor.  if you're currently in school, try the school councilor.  if a good friend has warm and caring parent you're comfortable with, reach out to them.  what you really need right now is some external validation that you've done nothing wrong, and perhaps some perspective on what your father is feeling.

best of luck.  you are NOT worthless, you did NOT do anything to deserve this, and you ARE loved."
366,"Absolutely agree.  Who knows where this douche may have uploaded this to.  The second he hit record secretly,  she was a fleshlight."
367,"&gt; And here he does this after being sober since Christmas and me just being foolish believing life was changing for us and hoping for better.
  
It's never foolish to hope, but sometimes ""better"" looks nothing like what we want it to.  Change is so difficult, especially with a small child depending on you and another on the way.  I've been you; I promise I understand.  The bottom line is that you can leave this man.  You do not have to keep throwing good time after bad.  Give yourself permission to be the one who is making the changes that will bring you that better life, instead of waiting for him to.  ""Us"" is you and your child(ren) now.   Life will go on."
368,I’m 27 and even 23yos are basically children to me. 18-19? Fuck no. Gross.
369,"&gt; If not over, it’s so far backwards that we’ll take years to build ourselves back to where we are.

No. You were NEVER where you thought you were with him. You can't get back to a place you never were. You're grieving for the man you thought he was, for the relationship you thought you had, but he was never that man, and your relationship is a lie. You only had trust because you didn't know his true character. Now you do, and he's so out of touch with people of good character that for now he's not even PRETENDING to feel bad about what he did."
370,"He hit you. Full stop.

Enough said, dump him and move on and require more for yourself.


You gut is SCREAMING at you, listen to it and listen to your mom."
371,"I hope I didn't offend with my guess. Without driving myself crazy thinking about every possibility, this is just one that fits for me.  
Hope it all went well for you!"
372,"I'm so, so sorry you are going through this. 

I recently lost a friend who went through the same thing. 

The numerous trips to cancer treatment centers, the treatment itself, treating the symptoms and the side effects...all of it became too much. I suspect both the cancer and the exhaustion led to her decision to do something different. 

I wish I had some magical advice, other than to support your wife as much as possible and take care of yourself, which may be beyond difficult. It might be helpful for her to hear some very valid to hear from some different, but completely validated/verified oncologist about treatment and symptoms."
373,"I used to be in a relationship where I felt frustrated by these sorts of mundane but annoying things. We broke up, and I started dating somebody else who was a bit more thoughtful, and all the day-to-day problems just never arose. It was crazy how much better it made the relationship, because there was never that baseline level of day-to-day frustration."
374,"A decade older than you, and:

&gt; he has wanted to have a kid with me since almost Day 1 

is all i needed to read.  And then it got worse.  

Sounds like he's trying to trap you OP.  Are you sure he has't been sabotaging your contraception methods?  RUN.  This is not a man you want in your life.  Look at his behavior?  Do you really want a man like that to father your kids????"
375,"You have no way of knowing. She was in full panic attack in a *safe* environment, can’t imagine a wedding."
376,"If she has no interest in counseling of some sort, you gotta go man. Honestly, would you want to be with someone who, without warning, just said she wants to be done before giving you a chance to work on anything? Sit down and figure out how you're going to deal with the house. Hopefully you haven't made any big wedding arrangements yet. Sorry, this really sucks. Good luck."
377,"As a bisexual who has had their own internal freak-outs:

-Attraction to men and women can feel different

-The role in the relationship that you wish to play can vary between male and female partners

-The frequency of your attraction to men versus women may not be equal

-While your understanding of your sexuality may change over time, bisexuality is a static identity and is *not* a crossroads on the way to Lesbianville. 

-Who you are is not changing. Your understanding of yourself is what is changing. 

-Labels are guidelines, not requirements. 

And that last one I wanna elaborate on a little bit. If I label all the containers in my fridge, that's helpful. If I stand at my kitchen counter for twenty minutes having a breakdown over whether the chicken pharm goes in the ""pasta"" or the ""chicken"" tupperware, that's NOT helpful. If your label isn't helping you anymore, GET RID OF IT. It's supposed to be HELPING you. If you feel limited, constricted, or like you've been given rules, FUCK. THAT. 

If you're happy where you are, then you're happy where you are. Your label doesn't even have to factor into that, they can be separate. If you're NOT happy where you are, your label doesn't have to factor into that either. Bisexuality is not the lever with which you must move your entire world. 

You're okay. You're going to be okay. Much love from a fellow bicycle."
378,"She is prescribed Adderall. T, her mother, and  her boyfriend are in the medical field and have interesting attitudes towards drugs. It is very easy for T to get whatever drugs she wants because of her field of work, but she doesn't abuse this privilege. Almost all of her colleagues as well as her boyfriend take Adderall while working and have very lax attitudes about it. They all have prescriptions for it and take regulated dosages. They usually don't take it if they are drinking."
379,"First of all, ask yourself why would a 26 year old man be interested in someone that literally *just* graduated high school? This isn’t normal."
380,"The texts don’t read like fake texts to me. If your goal was to make someone look terrible and break up their relationship, wouldn’t you be more likely to make it look like they said “last night was so hot, let’s do it again sometime” or something? Not, “I love my girlfriend and this was a terrible mistake”? Also, as you’ve noted, the timing makes no sense for it to be a jealous ex — what motive would she have after a full year apart? And include the fact about her knowing about the tattoo idea....sorry, but she seems pretty credible. I think you should take her at her word unless he somehow proves otherwise."
381,"Because I don't trust my boyfriend, and because I'm not allowed to follow her on my main account because my boyfriend wants to keep me a secret from her :) I might just be the dumbest most naive piece of shit on this planet"
382,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; he still wasn't certain about the genuineness of his feelings for me 

He's 29 and you've been dating 3 months.  You aren't asking for a marriage proposal!  All you want is to know if he wants to be in a romantic relationship or not and he can't even answer that.  And what is he doing to figure that out?  Pushing you away?!?!??  How in the world is that going to help him figure out his feelings for you?  

OP, you deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you!"
383,I had to do the same thing once. My partner refused to meet to have a serious talk. Just meant I broke up with them over text message instead. I gave them over two weeks.
384,but is it common to go for a four hour walk at 11pm when you're on vacation and staying in a waterfront hotel?
385,"Honestly, as the child of an addict, I'd be asking similar questions. Not from a place of judgment but because I wouldn't want anyone to go through the pain of relapse of a loved one if they can help it. It's life-shattering, not just for the addict."
386,No your statement was just needlessly hostile. The other persons way gets the message across with less likely hood of starting a fight from it.
387,"Look, sleepy Sujihime is dumb, inconsiderate, and not a good planner.  She doesn’t want to wake up even though I know I need to be up 5 minutes ago to catch the bus.  She will just hit snooze and think it’s ok to take Uber today (note: and then still hits snooze one too many times).  Sleepy sujihime is a jerk who sabotages daytime Sujihime.

My therapist told me to drink a glass of water first thing when my alarm goes off to kick start my body and wake myself up a little better.  It’s a mindfulness technique.  Sit up, drink the water, and focus on drinking the water and mediate on how is nourishes the body, waking up my systems and getting me ready for the day.  It takes about a minute and does help me get out of my irrational “snooze-cycle” and start my day better."
388,"He wouldn't even move in with her unless it was super close to his work. His level of enthusiasm for her and their relationship is like lukewarm soup. It's palatable, but not appetizing."
389,"Sorry to be harsh but it doesn't take somebody 2 years to decide if they love you. 

No doubt he likes you - but worst case is hes staying with you until he meets a girl he will love."
390,"The age gap is not the reason she shouldn't date him. She shouldn't date him because she's not that into him. 

Follow your gut, OP. And your ""no"" is a full sentence, and should be respected."
391,No we definitely saw some hookers. There were way more of them in the Tenderloin but if he's middle/upperclass enough to be travelling for work then I doubt he was brave or streetwise enough for a late night jaunt into the Tenderloin.
392,"If Katie was really your best friend, and you told her you were uncomfortable with her going to a concert alone with just your boyfriend after what you saw him do with her thigh and their intimate relationship, she would automatically back down and not go."
393,"Yes, OP should probably check to see if there was any activity on her BF’s Grindr account that night..."
394,"I have a friend who broke up with her partner, and the week after the break up her partner announced they were trans. My friend was worried that people who didn't know the situation would think that's why they split up and that she'd be cast in a bad light, but someone said something really important to her and I think you need to hear it too:

Even if that was the reason for the break up, it's okay.

It doesn't make you a bad person. It's a massive shift in your relationship dynamic, and it's okay to not be okay with that. It doesn't mean you've got a problem with that person and their identity - it just means that you need things that the relationship can no longer provide and you're acknowledging that.

It's perfectly okay to tell your partner that you love them and that you still want them to be in your life but in a different capacity. It's then up to your partner to decide if they're open to that too.

You sound like a really good friend, and I think that's something your partner needs right now. Drawing the line just means checking your communication - being fun rather than flirty. If you're complimenting your partner's hair, for instance, perhaps follow it up with ""I wish I could get my hair to do X"". By doing that, you're affirming your partner's identity without giving the impression that you're attracted to them.

Good luck!"
395,I think anyone taking his side is ignoring the fact that he was already upset when she said she'd told another man she loved him. He's clearly latching onto her contact with him as a more normal reason to be uncomfortable but even before he knew they were in contact he was unhappy. Huge red flag for controlling behavior.
396,He’s either immature/crazy or wants to score some “barely legal” 🤢
397,"This is key--at your age. My bf and I have a sizable age gap (11 years) but I'm 34 and he's 45, we're both legit, responsible adults who work,  pay taxes, and do adult-things like get our cars inspected and pay our own bills.  There's a lot of ground to cover between an 18 year old and a 26 year old. Not to mention that 18 year olds aren't very mature anyway. 

There was also NEVER any of that ""you're so mature for your age"" creepiness and at first my bf seemed a bit uncomfortable with the age gap, like he felt like he WAS taking advantage, but we've gotten over that. 

Tl:dr an age gap in itself isn't bad, but its highly dependent on where you are in life and other dynamics within a relationship."
398,This.  Get out now before you have kids with this man.
399,"Still, you allowed this to go on for 16 years. It's going to be awfully hard to turn that ship around now.

Sorry I don't have any useful advice, but it doesn't sound like you have much recourse, except to lay down an ultimatum... and if you do that, you'd better be prepared to follow through with it."
400,"Ugh. Way to make your big day all about him. You need to point this out to him and voice how much it's upsetting you. Hes used to you not standing up to him. Say something like ""Friend, this is my wedding to (lucky lady). I need you to be a good friend right now by being supportive and your behavior is making my life more stressful. If you are unhappy with being a groomsman please tell me now so I can find another one."" You fiance must be a saint to tolerate this attention hog even being invited."
401,I would actually prefer a breakup text. I get to process my emotions privately before responding.
402,"Sounds like you both need to learn some important communication skills. It sounds like at multiple points you guys have said things thoughtlessly in the heat of the moment that really hurt the other person, and each of those instances has contributed to your intimacy issues.

I honestly don't think getting engaged/ married should be on the table until his mental health is being taken care of and your sex life is meeting both your needs. Maybe he feels like he is ""dealing"" without meds, but anxiety and depression can contribute HUGELY to issues in the bedroom. That's not to say that it definitely is the cause, or that medication will solve it, or is medication the solution for him... I am not a doctor... BUT I think he has to take responsibility for his health and that includes talking to his doctor about medications, trying a few if the first one isn't a slam dunk (and it sucks, I know), going to therapy to try DBT/ CBT etc. After a few bad experiences with people with mental health problems that refused to take care of them (speaking as someone who has their own, and does,) I refused to date anyone else who didn't take care of their health, and I've never regretted it.

As for your sex life, I think you should take the focus off of sex and focus on intimacy. Just enjoy being around one another, have fun, be playful, and work your way up to sex. Work on communicating in a low-pressure, accepting, curious way. It'll come with time. If it doesn't, then you might want to think about which is more important, being with this guy (knowing that you could be just as happy and compatible with a number of unknown people who could meet your needs), or having a happy sex life."
403,"Absolutely, my mom acts like this and she has BPD. I was reading this and was like “hmmm sounds familiar.”"
404,"If she can't afford that, then she can't afford to travel for a year."
405,Yeah I'm doing some quick calcs in my head and there is no way she hasn't ticked up some extra debt you don't know about.
406,"Feels like he’s avoiding it and actively trying to force you to text him.

He’s probably being a shitty boyfriend to make you break up with him because he’s too scared or just doesn’t care about you and the relationship anymore. 

Break up with him and don’t put anymore time into him, he’s intentionally wasting yours."
407,"Those were my initial thoughts as well, BUT I'm leaning towards ""clingy friend who needs serious therapy to help with lack of self-esteem"" because his *need* for validation from OP sounds like somebody who has zero confidence in themselves and requires that ""boost"" from their friends to make them feel like they're worth something."
408,I thought this was a weird way to say it! Like he's scolding his alarm or something for him not having set it. It's like an almost apology but not really haha
409,I'm undergoing cancer treatment right now. She is lying.
410,"So you're willing to spend money on drinks at a bar with friends (which is NOT frugal living), but not on eating some different food at a decent time with your boyfriend??

No wonder he's annoyed."
411,"So, about 3-4 years ago, I behaved in a similar manner to your friend. Unknown to me at the time, but *very* apparent to those around me, I had undiagnosed mental health issues. I was negative 95% of the time, I refused to seek professional help and tried to seek comfort from her - towards the end, it was like she was my free therapist. I was annoyed she would hang out with her other friends but had no time for me yet I never initiated any type of meetups. She was very patient, understanding and caring for the 80% of the time we were best friends. I never took drugs but I did carelessly drink (a tequila shot - but still) and drive but I had no care in the world. This reminds me now, but something I had actually forgotten, but once I got so angry I cut myself on the wrist and I sent her a picture - how fucking manipulative of me. 

We had a mutual friend and she had a wedding. I wasn't a part of her bridal party, but I was invited for the wedding and reception. I told her I would go. I didn't end up going due to anything but anxiety. It is something that haunts me to this day. I told her I was sick - turned out I had bronchitis during the time but it wasn't a huge deal and I could still have gone. But I didn't go because of anxiety. Like, I literally cannot explain it more than that. I was paralyzed, I thought I would be out of place - but what I've learnt that is it's not about me - not everything is about me and the world doesn't revolve around me. That is something I think your friend will need to come in terms with. 

I remember one thing my ex bestfriend used to always tell me: ""I can look at the sky and tell you that it is blue. But if you think it is red, I will not be able to convince you otherwise. You will go on thinking it is red until one day you wake up and see that it is blue"". She wasn't aiming at me in a malicious way, it was just her way of showing me that I am, in fact, depressed - something I did not believe. 

You are not going to be the cure to her depression/anxiety/mental health issues - even if you are, that is far too much burden to place on one person and that is super unfair to you. 

It turned out we were very, very, VERY toxic for eachother. I am not saying you are toxic to your friend at all, but our particular friendship was VERY toxic. I had a huge fight with my parents that resulted in me moving out of my house for 2 years and she convinced me that ""I am your family now, you can cut ties with them"". Guess how that ended up in. She slowly stopped talking to me and I started gradually realising what the actual fuck I had done. I had cut my parents out of my life over a small fight that could have been solved and that I need some mental help - ASAP. 

I reached out back to my parents and moved back home. Thankfully, they are accepting. I got myself mental help. 

&gt; I don't feel equipped to deal with her without hurting her further and I feel like I need a therapist just to give me the appropriate emotional tools to be her friends.

This. You are not a therapist. Even if you are professionally, you are not your friend's therapist. A friendship should not feel like this. 

You have just gotten married to the love of your life and are about to start a brand new chapter with this man! While it is sad that you might lose a very close relationship, you will need to think about YOUR own health first. Look at how much stress and grief this is causing you .. at a time where you should be thinking about no one except your husband! 

&gt; Say i just text her back and say that everything is fine and I try to move forward - am I an enabler by not addressing the issue at hand with her?

I think you would. The elephant in the room will still be there. You will feel like you are walking on eggshells around her. You won't know how to react. Coming from someone who behaved in a *similar* manner to your friend, I think letting her friendship go is the best idea for both you and her. My friend cutting me off partially and the moment I realised wtf she had done, I sent her a massive letter cutting her off permanently - blocking her number, social media etc. Looking back, there were times I was being enabled by her - I sought after her care so I didn't want a care of a therapist. I am not saying you are enabling your friend, but think about it in 5 years time. You have a few kids, a pet or two and a tired, overworked husband. You want to have some fun and relax - you don't want to turn on to your best friend for them to unleash their next bucket of problem on you. She is NOT your child. She is NOT your responsibility. 

&gt; Would she be better served if I just stepped back for a while until she is able to resume a friendship with me?

I would like to think I have grown out of the above phase - I am medicated for my ADHD, not medicated for my anxiety but I do practice meditation. I try to think from the other person's shoes. You are not a reflection on your friends behaviour and problems. Having said that, not all friendships are made to last a life time. Sometimes we have to cut our losses and just be able to remember the good times.  

All in all, the best thing that happened to me is our letting our friendship end. I am sure she feels that too. She has moved on with her life - I have no idea where she is or what she is doing, but it allowed me to move on too. It was depressing at the start, but she will move on. You have to put your health above all, especially now that you have your own family. 

I hope my story made sense, pls let me know if you have any questions and I can explain further."
412,"&gt; I think his point of view is that if Katie was a male, I wouldn’t think twice about him going.

As the other comments point out, the comparison is a poor one.  If Katie were a male that he had groped (and then apologized for groping, demonstrating that he recognizes he was wrong), and if Katie were a male who had intimated to you that he was jealous of your relationship, I think *you would* think twice about going.

It's a lame cop out on his part."
413,"The texts were completely faked. He never sent them from any number. She assumed he still had the same number, so when I asked her to delete him as a contact and show me that the messages were sent from his phone number, she saved his contact name under the last number that she knew he had."
414,Have you tried walking around San Fran? It’s hell on earth with the hills. It’s common to take a cab to wherever you wanted to walk to and then just chill there especially if yiu’re From out of town when you realize just how shit of a city it is to walk.
415,"I know OP said she did not welcome rude comments about marrying young, so I hope this isn't perceived as one... But that is kind of the problem in this case in my opinion. As you said, they're both figuring a lot of big things out right now. Some will stick and some won't and you can't stay with someone for who they may be in the future."
416,"You need to do some research on sex. Women do not usually climax from being pounded in their vagina. That shit hurts. She's frustrated because you are reaching an orgasm one-sidedly every time, aka you're a selfish lover. 

Use your hands and mouth and learn to pleasure her. Sex should be a mutually enjoyable activity, not a male orgasm session."
417,"They want some kinda closure or blessing, IMO never speak to either of them again. They're dead to you. 

If you live with either of them, get your shit out while they're gone. Just flat out get away for these toxic pieces of shit. 

This sucks, but you don't need people like that in your life. Never speak to them again, if they corner you act as if they're not there, just get away. They dont deserve another second of your time or energy."
418,Is she prescribed Adderall? Or does she take it recreationally?
419,"When my SO and I started dating we had this big contention over going out to eat. ""You can just make that for cheaper why dont we stay in"" 

And after I explained that going out to eat isnt just paying for prepared food, its paying to not do the dishes and not have to think and plan dinner etc... Sometimes after a long week that is too much. 

And he was like ""oh ok that makes sense"" and now its fine"
420,"This. I literally came to leave the ""get tested"" comment. Some people are irresponsible and will not tell their sexual partners about the STDs they've got going on."
421,"Yeah, there's a lot about driving that can help you to avoid accidents at times... Mostly being aware of what's going on around you and driving defensively. OF COURSE this won't avoid all accidents, but it makes a big difference.

I can absolutely see being uncomfortable riding with someone who doesn't have/hasn't practiced this skill."
422,"Okay, OP, take a deep breath. I think you’ve been respectful about your opinion and your gf is an asshole for that response, but you should make it clear to her that you’re not upset about the tattoo - but you’re upset about the way she treated you."
423,"Then just buy some and have them with you. If he refuses condoms, walk away."
424,"You say she's 'relatively healthy, outside of cancer.'  She doesn't feel that way.  She feels she's lost her health and that the cancer treatments are taking it further away.  

Cancer treatments are so hard on the body.  Sure, they can keep a person alive but they'll never be the same as they were before.  And since you can't really see the cancer and usually don't feel many side effects from it, it's easy to blame the chemo for everything.

You know alternative treatment is not going to work.  She probably does too, deep inside.  But she doesn't feel like the traditional treatment is 'working' because she's not getting better - in fact, she may feel she's getting worse.  Changing to a different treatment makes her feel like she is taking control, instead of letting chemo whittle her health away bit by bit.  It's been 7 years of decline for her - maybe she doesn't want another decade of dying slowly."
425,"So send him a screenshot and see what his reply is.

&amp;#x200B;

And do tell us why you follow your bf's ex with a secret instagram account? Whats up with that?"
426,"Exactly. He's not a good dad if this is the behavior he models to his child. And your child will absolutely become a target in due time. 

My dad had an awful temper when I was growing up, and my mom was constantly trying to tiptoe around and placate him. By the time he turned his temper on me, my mom was no longer a good mom. For the sake of ""keeping the peace,"" she would side with him and berate me for setting him off, even when I'd done nothing wrong. She always had excuses for him, but zero compassion for me.

My dad's temper issues had a deeply negative impact on my relationship with BOTH parents. Don't kid yourself, your relationship with your child is at risk here. If you don't show your child that you are willing to stand up for her and do what's best for her, I guarantee that she will come to resent you."
427,"1. it sounds like she uses the place as a crash pad because she's often out of town/busy at work/ with friends etc, so she doesn't care how it looks or feels since as she said she's rarely there. 2. She's 22. Most 22  year olds are still living with roommates on their college furniture. 3. Just because she's this way now doesn't mean she would be the same if you lived together- if it's important to you to have a home-y home, maybe she would be totally down."
428,What? No. You're telling a shitty person who treated you like trash to get his god damn things out of your house already so he can leave you the fuck alone.
429,"Um, he most definitely cheated. Also he's a *terrible* liar... if he's going to make up stories he should at least make them somewhat believable. Ffs."
430,"Never open a relationship to fix it. Opening a relationship should only be done when you are starting from a solid base with good communication, and you guys aren't. Really, I think you are trying to put off the inevitable, which is ending this relationship amicably and becoming good co-parents for your kids without being together."
431,"Wow, sounds like he's got some major issues about sleep, probably stemming from his parents. It was probably drilled into him at an early age that sleeping in late is ""lazy"" and only terrible unsuccessful people do that. Of course, that's his problem to deal with, not yours. Is he willing to go to individual therapy to work on his unreasonable feelings about your sleep schedule?

I call it unreasonable because it doesn't sound like it affects him much. I would understand where he's coming from if you were just sleeping all day and watching tv all night, or you weren't getting any chores done, or you weren't spending any time with him. But it sounds like you're getting all your normal adult tasks done, just on a schedule that works for you, and that you wouldn't spend any more time with him if you got up earlier, because he goes to work early. Maybe he's upset that you don't get to cuddle in bed all night or something? But if he was I hope he would just say that, not repeatedly call you lazy for something that is 100% not a ""you are lazy"" issue and IS a ""I feel upset"" issue.

You should not try to change your schedule for him if you know that it's not productive for you. His feelings about people who stay up late and sleep in late are his problem to work through. Having said that, if he's not willing to do any more work on this himself, this situation probably isn't going to change. So, can you live with him calling you lazy for the rest of your life? Or not?"
432,"More than likely, yeah. I didn’t want OP to think I was just jumping to worst possible conclusion since *technically* there’s no evidence of it, just a long long history of lying to her, alcoholism, gambling addiction, and visiting prostitutes (along with other cheating), all of which were done while in a relationship with her. Kind of reminds me of that post recently, I can’t remember which relationship sub it was in, where the girl says “Do you really think I’d lie down and take that?” to which the guy responds “You did for four years”. Just awful treatment and it’s a shame that OP believed for such a long time that she deserved that."
433,"Yeah, this is unacceptable behaviour. Although the initial comment *could* be excused as just unintentional insensitivity or a bad-taste joke, the fact that he mocked you for being upset by it is concerning because he should empathise with you and respect your feelings, not react to them with hostility. I think you should talk to him about it and tell him that you want him to be more considerate of your feelings about comments like this."
434,A LITTLE? This dude is bonkers.
435,"I've literally been in this girl's position. I'm narcoleptic and began taking caffeine pills but my long term partner would get posses every time I fell asleep. I once fell asleep mid conversation with him on the porch and he got posses and left me outside. The caffeine and stimulants caused my hands to shake all of the time, I had no appetite and was constantly nauseous. He was happy that I could make it through a movie without falling asleep despite the fact i was destroying my heart, my brain, and my body.

OP do not let this happen to you. This problem will never go away. He has to learn o deal with it and you guys will have to find a compromise because you can not fix it, at least right now. And he needs to be empathetic and understand."
436,"Yeah, this is suspicious as hell. 

Also, if someone was being psycho enough to fake texts from me, I would want to have proof because that's some scary stuff and I'd want to know wtf was going on so that I can start gathering evidence in case they escalate such obsessive behavior. Either way, I wouldn't be just hanging out and I for sure wouldn't deflect like that. 

Ultimately, if someone showed my SO proof like this, I'd understand them doubting me even if we had the most trusting relationship in the world, and I would be doing anything and everything to prove that I was telling the truth. 

To OP, I'm betting if you press him on this, especially with the added evidence of the tattoo, he'll admit it happened. That shows he's lying at least, and I can't think of why he would except to hide cheating. I'm really sorry. But if you want the truth, I would approach it by telling him what you know, and basically being like ""I pretty much know what happened, and I'm asking you to at least be honest with me about it."" The fact is that a guy like this will continue lying to you as long as he thinks there's a chance that flat out denying it will work."
437,"Sorry to say this buddy, but if you've just been letting her get her way again and again then this is your fault too. Stand up for yourself and stop letting her treat you like shit."
438,"I suspect treating it as “our money” would only exacerbate the issue in this particular case, because then she would be spending all of “our money”."
439,Who knows. They had dated for a year and a half and it was both of their first relationship. I think he was just really dreading it. Some people hold things off until the last possible moment to avoid it. He had to know she was just going to text him then when he refused to answer a phone call.
440,"You will probably have to break the lease. A standard penalty would be 2 months’ rent, but check your lease to be certain."
441,"Wow... I've never heard from a sociopath who has deliberately decided to change their ways! Good on you! I know how hard it can be to deal with chronic mental illness and I have immense respect for this.

Thank you for making an effort to improve the world."
442,"I think in a relationship, love and feelings can only get you so far. I find a lot of people fail to realize that long-term relationships are a commitment. When an argument happens or a problem arises, it has to be your choice to fix it. It has to be your choice to want to be better, and it has to be your choice to want to stay. Even despite the hard and challenging times. Hope that offers you some perspective. :) I apply it to all of my relationships, including friendships and family."
443,Lol @ the people who assumed he cheated
444,Well tjat was important information you buried. This guy is lazy and selfish.  Stop babying him!!  He is 27.  He can buy food and pots and pans.  He can make dinner for YOU or order food in . he can pack a bag and stay over.  Start insisting and stop playing mommy to him.  See if he cares enough to grow up.
445,""" I can't put my finger on how I became this person. I know I struggle with vulnerability; I'm rarely the person who asks others to hang out. I'm terrified I'll be deemed ""boring"" or something. But when I see a happy couple, or someone I follow online hanging out with their friends at a bar, or whatever, I get struck with pain. It makes me shut down.""

&amp;#x200B;

And this is where you go to see a good therapist.  Counseling is self-improvement, no different than learning about something, like taking a class about something.

&amp;#x200B;

Since you don't know how you became this person, a good counselor can help you figure that out and help you to move through it and past it.

Good luck"
446,"No, like set the **time and the date** and don’t give him the option of dragging it out. YOU have given him the very power over you that you are frustrated with. Stop doing that. You are under no obligation to be “nice.”  You stated that he is abusive in various ways. Abuse does not have to be hitting to be real. Stop allowing this abuser to waltz in and out of your home at his leisure. YOU are in charge. Take charge."
447,Age gap is a huge concern. Controlling behavior even more so. Let her know you’ll be there for her. She may not listen now but she is definitely going to need you in the future.
448,"how was she ""selfish"" exactly? what bad happened from her not being there (but having communicated well ahead, she did not no-show)? not-prioritizing you is not the same as being selfish. selfish would be going, but sobbing wildly or not going but as a no-show. or going but leaving in the middle. there are lots of ways to be selfish at someone else's wedding. not-going and giving plenty of notice is not selfish.

you wanted her to prioritize your wedding over her mental health. and now you want multiple texts kissing your ass? over what? forgive her, for what exactly? you are coming off bridezilla here, i'm sorry. unless something bad happened due to her abscence, you really need to to check yourself. if this is your friend, be a friend."
449,"/r/justnomil has advice.

Its one thing if your husband genuinely wanted a baby and put in the effort to prove he'd make it work and address your concerns.  I'm pregnant with our third and honestly my partner wanted the timing more than me, I would've waited a few years- so my partner did the legwork and budgeting to prove we can make it work. (and also has been a stay at home dad for 5 years so I know he's taking on most of the labor once baby is here because he's historically proven it)

Which is light years away from ""my mom won't get off my back so spread your legs and think of england"".

And I still could've said no and for awhile I *did* veto trying because I wasn't convinced and my partner just accepted that and didn't bring it up. 

If he'd tried to push the matter or if it was a ""I don't want this but my mom does""? Hell no.

Consider going to planned parenthood and discuss birth control options. 

Both he or his mother could sabotage a lot of birth control (condoms, pills, spermicide, etc are all easily rendered ineffective).  I know you don't want to think they'd do such a horrific violation- but it's better to protect yourself while you sort this shit out.

The LAST thing you want right now is to be pregnant."
450,"&gt;So your gf is emotionally cheating on you with your ""best friend""?

That's exactly it. They can spin it however they want, but that's what they did, and now they have the audacity to want OP to be okay with all of it. 

OP, Kate and Andrew are being selfish af. They want you to be okay with them together to make themselves better, it has nothing to do with what's right for you. They have every right to be with who they want to be, but they do does not have the right to dictate how you respond to it and then guilt you into staying in their lives. Do not put yourself through hell for people who wouldn't do the same for you."
451,"But if he was bar hopping, why not just SAY he was checking out the nightlife? The fact that he's lying is half the problem here."
452,"You are ex friends with the best friend and the guy is the ex-boyfriend of that girl, so it seems like neither of you are that interested in her opinion , so why are you two hesitating?"
453,He eventually connected. Just was off to start. Never happens like that. Who knows who he ushered out of the room or what he was cleaning up. :(
454,"&gt;  I told him I thought I was looking for a copy of Munchkin.

You must have been REALLY high."
455,"Agreed, jmportant next question for OP following this - is it normal that she is not so good with empathy, and a little self centred?"
456,"I’m so interested to know how the ex knew when OP was out of town, and how she knew about the tattoo. And why the BF told varying versions of talking to her, and why he exchanged numbers with her at all. 

I jumped to conclusions, for sure. But feel so unsatisfied with the update. 🙈"
457,"Your 40-year-old BF resents being asked to do a basic adult task as part of the exercise of having a meal with another person. He doesn't realize this is a small way of showing appreciation and respect. 

There is probably no fixing that about him. If he doesn't know by now the value in grabbing napkins or cutlery when your partner has cooked. Most adolescents grasp this. It'll be an uphill battle teaching him. 

He also can't expect to block out basic living-level shit with his GF, and expect his relationship to remain healthy. He can't demand you read his mind for his need for quiet, and he also needs to balance his quiet time with basic respect for the person he shares his home with.

Frankly, if your shoes I'd be sitting down and asking him point-blank about his stress level and what he intends to do to address it, now that is has become this toxic. If something like being asked three times (and ignoring those requests, and ignoring it is exactly what he did. Again, you can't be expected to read his damn mind) to get cutlery is causing him to snap and feel this much stress and aggression, then he is not in a mentally healthy place and he needs some support and better tools. 

Or, you could just walk. Cause who the hell needs an angsty teenager-going-on-middle-aged in their life?"
458,"Benzos aren't antidepressants, unless I missed somewhere that she said she took benzos as well.  But it is a good idea not to drink when your mental health is not stable. ADHD can lead to a lot of anxiety/depression as well and often times treating ADHD improves the other issues."
459,My friends boyfriend of over a year broke up by telling her he didn't find her attractive. It completely devastated her and led her to seeking attention from some pretty terrible guys just to validate her attractiveness. DO NOT tell her attraction is the problem.
460,The tattoo gave him away. At least he tried hard to hide it from you
461,"I encountered this with my mother in law. My husband and I knew from day one that we were not going to have children, and she kept insisting that we would and should change our minds because it was selfish not to give her a grandchild. I got fed up and told her that it was not selfish to bring a child into the world that we didn't want to have, but it was mighty selfish of her to expect us to reproduce for her benefit and bragging rights with her friends. 

When I got my tubes tied, she tried to pretend that I did this against my husband's wishes in order to blame me for her disappointment. He quickly set her straight about that.

What I'm getting at here is that sometimes, tact doesn't work. I tried tact for the first few years of our marriage, and it was perceived as wishy washiness on our part. A simple request to not bring this up anymore because you think it's intrusive and inappropriate to be so focused on someone else's reproductive choices should do. It doesn't have to be delivered rudely, but gentle and firm is generally enough to do the trick with normal people. 

Few things are as annoying as people that want to dictate something this personal. If being gentle but firm about shutting this conversation down doesn't work, shut them down and ignore any attempts to discuss the matter. Leave the room, remind them that it's not open to discussion, and they will eventually get the message."
462,"Well yeah, of course he won’t deal with his childhood. It’s such a convenient excuse for his treatment of you. Why would he willingly give that up? 

He’s abusive, OP. The “why” is irrelevant."
463,"Agree. Plus, op needs to get tested for std's immediately."
464,"To follow up on this, you're idealizing her... alot! In your head, she *IS* perfect. In reality, she doesn't want to date you. The mismatch of your perception of her and her real-life actions is going to cause some (often subconscious) self-doubt and second-guessing that can really magnify the ""normal"" self-esteem hit of an ordinary rejection."
465,"She's probably never really entered the workforce, seeing as she was 20 when they got married. 

She would have a hard time getting a job in retail, let alone one that could pay for childcare.

These two really painted themselves in a corner."
466,"Blocking your exit and physically preventing you from leaving an argument or situation is abusive behavior. Following you to try and force you to talk when you wanted to get away from him and cool off is also abusive behavior. 

Your friend is right, you shouldn't tolerate that. He's showing you a pattern, since you say he's done it before but promised not to do it again. He's going to keep ""oops I did it again"" ing you, and will quite possibly escalate over time. 

IF he's willing to do individual therapy and anger management, tells you a concrete plan for how he intends to stop this behavior, and then shows you with his actions that he's following through, then *maybe* he'll deserve a 3rd chance. As it stands now, though, he doesn't deserve shit."
467,Same old same old. He now has two more years before he decides whether he wants to be married to you or not. He spends a few minutes learning about rings and you think he’s made a commitment. Since you last posted what have you actually got him to commit too?
468,"I doubt he'd let me see it.  He's said in the past Google was inaccurate. Google, GPS, uber... all inaccurate and out to get him I guess. 

I know, I know :("
469,"Give her a call &amp; just hear her out. Put yourself in “listen-only” mode. Then, focus on your marriage and book yourself a therapist. As it was once observed to me, therapy is champagne for the soul. You’re going to be okay."
470,"Google location tracking is scary accurate.  It marks a trip when I walk from my house to my mailbox.  So,  that's definitely a lie."
471,"It's free online, OP. Good luck."
472,"I hate breaking up over text, but did it once. Same scenario but my bf avoided men for three weeks. So I tried to break up over the phone and he faked a heart attack as I was talking to him. I went to visit him at the hospital he said he was staying at, my mistake was giving him a heads up. As I got to the hospital he called and said to meet him at the pub around the corner, he had wires taped to his chest saying his heart was being monitored. It was bs, I'd done cardiology at university. Anyways tried again on the phone a week later and he pretended he couldn't hear me, a bad line. So I eventually just gave up and text him. Not sure how long he would ha e continued to avoid me. 

So my advice is to just do it, yes it's shitty but it seems it can't be helped"
473,Still not your problem.
474,"&gt;  I want my children to bear my name, which I partially acknowledge is selfish and antiquated, but I want suggestions for how to get over these feelings of doubt. 

My wife (who kept her maiden name) and I decided that we would give the kids last names based on their gender. Boys got mine. Girls got her. We have a daughter and a son. So it's all even Steven. Caused confusion for about 10 seconds at school, but otherwise everything has been completely fine. 

If you don't want to hyphenate, you could do some merge of your last names and everyone take that. Have seen some families do that. Or take a completely other name of your choosing, but I don't think either of those things will assuage your need to have your kids take your name. 

This all sounds hugely important now, but once they're born, you won't care at all what their last name is. You'll just want to love and protect them."
475,"It sounds like your mom may come around given time to normalize this. You just dropped a ""bomb"" on them a few weeks ago letting them know you're not only in a relationship but planning marriage. It's challenging her but she's already imagining what would happen if she did come around. Do you believe your dad and brother would not come around if your mom does? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know the dynamics of your family but I'd hang tight for a few more weeks while they get used to the idea of you being in a ""forbidden"" relationship. Then see if you can have your mom meet your boyfriend. Let her know you think she'll love him for XYZ reason.  When she argues, disengage but leave the door open. ""I'd love for you to meet him when you are ready."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately it's up to you if you think you can break down your family's resistance or want to risk a distant relationship them if you can't or want to break up with your boyfriend and see if there's a more family suitable match out there. Those are your three options: wear them down, accept disownment, or break up. Good luck OP, I'm hoping you can wear them down and get your happiness."
476,This was best case scenario. Thank god it played out.
477,"And you don't have to go somewhere new to start over. Start over where you are. Try becoming a yes man. Even if it makes you uncomfortable, say yes. Your roommate invites you to hang out with their cool gang, say yes. Even if you're just sitting there being silent, you may still enjoy the company and they might enjoy having you and strike up conversation. You don't always have to do the work, at least to start out. But do something scary and say yes!"
478,Thank you for the resource
479,"yeah, I do that with exam/essay marks. I never check them until I have to because as long as I don't know what the mark is, I can tell myself that everything is okay and I don't have to face a possibly bad grade. Last time around, I avoided my grades until half an hour before my graduation ceremony started because I couldn't face them until I absolutely had to. You are absolutely right, the avoidance was rooted in fear, I was terrified of doing badly. (I got good marks just in case anyone's wondering, I was just very convinced that I didn't)"
480,"Because I dont know. I hoped?

Life is hard, I have no family to rely on and am 8 weeks pregnant.  And here he does this after being sober since Christmas and me just being foolish believing life was changing for us and hoping for better."
481,"Keep it light, just say the bits where he was positive. Where he said you were clearly happy together and he could see that.

If you relay the negative, it’ll just create a rift and that might spiral. Unless you intend to have a serious discussion about the misanthropist tendencies and concerns that you also have noticed, there’s no reason to bring it up. Even then, I wouldn’t name names."
482,"She was driving, I was navigating. We were beginning to cross a fairly narrow, long bridge in heavy traffic, and I said ""Okay, we're crossing this bridge and then immediately after we are over the river, there's going to be a right exit and we need to take it, so get in the right-hand lane."" She said ""I can't see it.""

I said ""No, you'll see it right as we're over the bridge, so get in the right lane now.""

She said, louder and higher-pitched, ""*I can't see it!!!*""

I said ""It won't be visible until we're over the river, but it's there, so get in the right hand lane.""

In heavy traffic and narrow lanes, she started shrieking ""I CAN'T SEE IT I CAN'T SEE IT I CAN'T SEE IT"", took her hands off the wheel and started waving her arms in the air having hysterics *with her eyes closed*. I grabbed the wheel and kept us in our lane with one hand and slapped her across the face with the other. That brought her out of her hysterics. The second we were off the bridge and could safely pull over, I ordered her to, and I drove for the rest of the trip, because her behaviour could have killed not just us, but a bunch of other people on the bridge.

Oh, and we *missed the fucking exit*. God, I'm still mad when I think about it. We could have died!"
483,"Not being at fault doesn't always mean that you couldn't have avoided an accident. Stomping on the brakes when it's slippery and there's someone behind you is a reaaaaly bad idea. The same one with a tailgater. You should've slowed down gently, barely making the brake light come on at first. I wouldn't blame him for caring about his safety - the way the accidents happened would have me consider if it's safe to drive with you, too."
484,"You need to have a serious conversation with your wife about budget. You had 5 kids on one income. Have you talked about budget and spending ...what you can/can't afford? What expenses your kids will have as they get older? What are priorities vs luxuries? 


Who does the budgeting and bill paying?


You say you've talked about this in the past...when? Before kids? Before kid 3? Before kid 5? Have you talked about things maybe changing in a few years when the 4 year old is in school all day? 


And have you talked about what needs to be done at home? You say that she's not really taking care of the home....have you spoken about both of your reasonable expectations....what's reasonable for her to get done while she's a SAHM and what's reasonable for you to split. How home things would be split if she got a part time job?"
485,"Yeah, no, it’s not about the number, it’s about that fact he even tried to apply it to his partner. That’s not a joke, it’s just being an asshole."
486,"Change your credit card number, start working on paying down the debt. Then you've got your credit card for emergency funds that'll you need *when you move out*. You're an adult now. Make adult decisions."
487,"i don t want to sound unempathic but to be realistic: you didn t have a close relationship with her. you were not dating. you were not kissing. she even rejected you. you fell for her and surely were trying your best to make her feel what you felt. 

but: love is never hard. love comes easy. love is never a struggle to obtain. and most important: you d never have to proof something to be worth loving. if she didn t see your worth, maybe she s not even worth it?"
488,"Your bro didn’t keep his crummy choices a secret. From a 16 year old.

489,"&gt; If he’d just have asked, he knows I’d have agreed. Why do this?

Because the thrill is in *not* asking. Knowing that you didn’t consent is what makes it exciting for him. 

This is a hard dealbreaker. You’ll never be able to trust a person like this. The rest is just logistics."
490,"There are people who have partners they know aren’t technically attractive but their sense of humor, personality etc *makes* them attractive to that person. 

When that chemistry isn’t there, it’s a friendship or at least a platonic dynamic. 

So is it that you don’t feel any romantic chemistry? Or is it that you do but are then turned off by her physical looks?"
491,Read OPs comment that clearly says she's going to therapy and is taking medication.
492,"When someone tells you all their exes were awful/crazy/didn't treat them right etc., that should introduce a certain amount of suspicion that the someone, not the exes, was really the problem. And moreover, that those same issues may start to present themselves in your relationship. In this case, it sounds like you are already starting to see the start of them. Just some food for thought. 

As for what you tell your girlfriend, you could say ""I think he enjoyed hanging out with you! He can be a bit protective though, so it might take him some time to fully warm up to you."""
493,"I'm pretty sure the guy who invited you shooting considers this a date. This is why your bf who is miles and miles away is upset. Not to mention, shooting guy is a total stranger who you met at a bar... Someone didn't think this through or is totally downplaying it."

Please consider ending the pregnancy. You’re early enough that you could just take the pill. Trust me, I know how hard this is. I’m a single mom in the bay just trying to stay afloat. I know I wouldn’t be able to do that with two children and no support system. One baby with a lying cheat is more than enough; I have one myself. Think of yourself and your little girl. Life will be nearly impossible with two kids, no job, and no support. I’m sorry to be so harsh, but I have your best interests at heart. There is no guarantee your ex will pay support—mine doesn’t.

498,"Could it be something to do with trauma? It could be gambling addiction for sure, as others have suggested, but to have your 9th birthday party listed as the single best day of your life is not normal...

499,"Ahhh, you are dating what Captain Awkward calls the ""Darth Vader boyfriend:""  you know, ""There's good in him, I can feel it!""

A man is not a project.  He is a fully autonomous human being.  If he wanted to be ""the man you know he could be,"" he would have already, you know, *done that.*

And the roller coaster ride is called ""the cycle of abuse.""  Now, I'm not saying that your bf is abusive!  What I *am* saying is that the high you experience when things are good is part of that cycle, a crucial part:  trauma bonding.

See the high happens because all the stress hormones are finally allowed to recede--you know, you stop walking on eggshells for an evening or two.  When the stress goes, dopamine hormones flood your system; that's where the euphoria comes from, the feeling that you could die right now and know that you can die happy, for you have experienced a happiness so great that is practically splits your skin trying to express itself.

Right?

Okay.  *Dopamine is what makes heroin so fucking sweet.*  It's addictive.  You hang on, willing to endure any amount of misery for those sweet moments of happiness. **You are addicted to the cycle.**  That's trauma bonding.

And like any other addiction, there is lying involved.  A junkie will say anything, do anything to get her next hit:  and that is what your brain is doing, feeding you *lies* so that you stay, so that you give it access to its drug of choice.

***

Say, while we're at it, could you go to loveisrespect and take the quiz?  What did you score?

***

You need to break the addiction.  You are thinking about this relationship like any alcoholic thinks about booze, the way the junkie thinks about smack:  it's fine; you can handle it; now isn't a good time to stop.

If you've ever wondered why addicts don't just *stop,* why they can't see the obvious self-destruction, well, *now you know.*  Addiction is nasty.  Addiction wants what it wants and isn't afraid to tell you nasty things about yourself to ensure that you never walk away from its supply.

You've been feeding yourself LIES for a while now.  You need to detox.  A therapist who specializes in toxic relationships can help with the process of getting the monkey off your back."
500,"Go to your therapy appointment. This is certainly a lot to process, and a terrible betrayal. The one positive thing I see is that she disclosed it to you under no duress. People are riddled with imperfections, and everyone’s standards for what is forgiveable are different. Therapy is a really good place for you to figure out what yours, and a good place to figure out who your wife is and if you think she can be trusted again."
501,"Your girlfriend has an eating disorder. I think you need to sit her down and tell her you're there to support her if she needs help and that you're not judging, but that she does need to get help. This is a bad sign, ED has the highest rate of death among ALL mental illnesses. (Also weight loss is necessarily something that goes with ED--so you might not have noticed). But you have to bring it up and talk to her."
502,It took you five years to get tired of this?
503,"You don't have to buy two houses. You need one apartment, room, trailer, whatever. You have options. Take a step back and breathe. I know it's crazy with a kid and long work hours, but you CAN take half a day to make a plan and leave. You CAN afford it, you just need to figure out how and realize you may need to downgrade before you can upgrade. Don't create this false dichotomy where you always lose. You may feel stuck, but you're not. You got this!"

That is awesome. You aren't backing out of doing it, you can't do it.

""Hey friend, talked with my husband and we agreed it isn't a good idea to watch your cats for a year. I'm sorry. Have a great trip.""

When she asks you why feel free to list all the reasons:
- dog. This is a big one. You don't want to make him uncomfortable in his home. He has never been around cats, you don't want that to become dangerous.
- new house &amp; new furniture.
- taking care of a special needs cat is not something you want to do.
- if you want to vacation you can take your dog. You don't want to worry about her cats.
- no.

Don't feel guilty. You have your own life and people who already depend on you. She can find someone else."
509,"I know how your girlfriend feels. I have struggled with my weight most of my life, and I'm 50/50 on if I like how I look. Sometimes I feel great,, and other days I can't stop the inner voice telling me I'm fat and ugly. 

On those days, I.do tend to vent to my fiance about it. He does a lot of what you do; tells me I'm gorgeous and sexy and he loves how I look. A thing he does that really helps me, though, is validating the things I'm doing to improve/lose weight. If I'm telling him I hate the stubborn fat on my belly and it makes me feel super gross, he'll say something like ""Well, you crushed it at the gym every day so far, and you looked sexy AF when you were able to run faster than you could last week."" Or ""I'm sorry you're feeling down, but remember that you lost 2 pounds last week, and that's really amazing."" 

Him letting me know he's seeing my victories and admiring them really helps shut that self-loathing voice up"
510,"Welp. You got a bad one.

Did you want to be treated like crap? That’s what bad boys do. He gave you the whole experience. 

Hope you got it out of your system, for your sake."
511,"Dude, call that little perv the hell out. Honestly I would throw away the underwear too. That's absolutely disgusting and he knows it. If you really want to be extra I'd have him pay you the cost for a new vibrator and if you're comfortable with it make it abundantly clear why to your parents, because embarrassment and fiscal consequences will probably double drive home how nasty he is for that. God, I'm sorry! Gross."
512,"You think he's still into her, so your answer is to force him to stop talking to her, instead of, I don't know, having a little self respect and leaving?"
513,"Tbh, I had to read twice when you wrote you would choose your boyfriend over her.. that speaks volumes to me. I think you know, subconsciously or otherwise, that she’s not a good friend to you - and time doesn’t really mean much in that regard. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this, but as far as I can see, distancing yourself is by far the best option here. For her to have brought that up to jab at your boyfriend (which she wouldn’t be doing anyway, if she was a true friend) is quite telling about how vindictive and careless she is in pursuit of “winning” an argument."
514,"You can definitely make it burn off. 

1. No personal conversations. None. Professional conversations only.
2. No interactions outside of work. None.
3. Do not let your mind go there. If you ever find yourself fantasizing about him, or looking forward to seeing him - don’t. Slap yourself metaphorically. Do not go there. 

It will burn off. I swear."
515,"This. Honestly OP THANK YOU for having the will and strength to do this. It takes courage. No one wants to break things off with someone they otherwise get along well with.

But with the gut feeling as you mentioned, the relationship goals that cannot be compromised, before you know it if you had stayed - you would have wasted each other's life by another 10, 15 years.

My ex was similar, but he was so passive he just kept telling me what I wanted to hear. I am now with someone who has 0 doubts about being married to me and is full on ecstatic at the chance to be my husband.

Like I said. You absolutely made the right call."
516,"Are they also harbouring the same prejudices? I hope not and I hope they choose love of you over hate of a generalized group of people. 

You are the one living your life, they are the one's trying to control someone else's life. You will resent them for it."
517,"There are give and takes to every relationship and sometimes every personality trait. Your bf sounds very easy going and highly supportive of you, but not so much of himself. He may just be one of those who prefers his partner to take the lead and he’s happy to go along. It’s not wrong, but in any given situation you’re going to be doing a trade off. You could break up with him and look for somebody who has more ambition but they may care a lot less about supporting you or want to take more control of the activities/things you do together. If you’re not getting your needs met, the relationship won’t withstand no matter what. But I would look closely at the pros and cons instead of jumping to a break up if you really love him/enjoy spending time together."
518,Shit. It's getting really bad really fast.
519,Isn’t Flucloxacillin sometimes given to prevent infections when people are prone to them or after surgery to prevent wound infection?
520,"Your boyfriend is allowed to not want to sit in your car. That is his choice, because he is an independent adult who is looking out for his own safety. You can not force your bf into a car which he does not feel comfortable being in. That would make you the controlling one.

He isn’t telling you what you can or can’t drive. He is just making a decision for HIMSELF. If you want to drive, drive! He’s not stopping you.

As for fault, tbh I would have a similar mindset as your bf. Four accidents in four years is not great, even if they aren’t your fault per insurance. Your rate still goes up. It’s still an absurdly high accident rate for someone who just started driving. 

Abiding by the law to the letter doesn’t always mean people will feel safe in your car. My mom drives “grandma” style and I feel the least safe in her car because I feel like she is unable to react properly to unknowns and does not properly take into account what OTHER people are doing. Example, she will back out of a parking lot very slowly, to the point where other people have no idea if she’s backing up or not. On a highway she will slow down if she feels anxious, but this is unsafe if everyone around you is unprepared for your slowdown. Sometimes speeding up slightly and getting out of someone’s way may prevent an accident completely.

There is also something called defensive driving, which means being proactive about all the POTENTIAL harms that can come and planning an escape route or making proactive moves to escape. Since you have been rear ended a lot, it’s possible that you aren’t paying enough attention to the speed of the car behind you. If someone is tailing you closely like the truck guy, braking is not a great answer. Yes you are LEGALLY doing the right thing, but experience would have told you how much you could slow down based on the distance he was behind you, and if it was not enough distance, to not slow down. There are ways to prevent or minimize accidents even when they aren’t your fault."
521,"I know a lady who has been with a guy for 10 years and he makes way more and they have two kids and they still do this. 

He hasn’t married her and he literally makes her split half of everything. What’s his is his and what’s hers is hers. They even get the kids separate gifts for everything. 

Might as well be single."
522,Why did you post this thread? You know what's going on.
523,True but it always happens when OP is out of town.  That's quite a coincidence
524,"This is one of the many problems that happens when we allow politically biased shock jock shows mascaraed around like the 5 o'clock news. Older generations have a hard time filtering the truth from biased opinion. 

Please watch The Brainwashing of my Dad, with your mother. It is a documentary about how media has changed the ethical ideology of older Americans. I think it will help clarify some feelings I doubt your mom even knows she has."
525,"A lot of people are commenting on the age difference but just know that it’s ok not to date someone simply because you don’t want to or you don’t feel comfortable. I got into my first relationship at 18 and I didn’t want it but I felt bad saying no - I wish someone had told me this. There’s so much talk about consent in sex (which is very important) but no one talks about whether people want or are comfortable with relationships. You don’t need a magical reason not to date someone, if you’re not comfortable and you’re doubting, that’s enough."
526,"I would simply go to them and say this: 

_We agreed originally on an introductory rate of $6/hr. However, as you are too, I am trying to make a go of things. I can't pay my bills on $6/hr. Going forward (or starting on &lt;date&gt;), I would love to continue sitting for &lt;you kids&gt; for $15/hr._

And leave it at that. I wouldn't get into that business of what they're actually spending their money on. Butting into their spending decisions gives them a straw man to attack and you'll end up arguing more about what they're spending on than what you're actually asking which is to pay you properly. Pay me, or find another sitter.

If you want, do some research. Find out what the going rate for babysitting is in your area. I bet its a lot more than $6/hr... probably a lot more than $12, probably more than the $15 you originally wanted. If you really value this relationship and want to keep them as clients, sure give them a friends/family ""discount"" back to $12 if you like, but you should remind them that if you weren't doing this favour for them, they'd be paying market rates of $x/hr."
527,"End it. Let her go. She deserves someone who is attracted to her, and doesn't have to force compliments to her. Give her a chance to find that."
528,"I’ve told my friends I’m not going out of my way to tell your secrets, but if someone asks, I’m going to be honest. So his friends might share similar perspectives. Yes, I suck for knowing shit is going on and not saying so. But if I’m not close to their SO, they’d likely think I were jealous (I’m a woman, and that’s how we are often painted -jealous or we want the man). But if anyone, friend or not, comes to me, I will speak the truth simply and plainly and they can take it or leave it. 

I think there’s quite enough evidence here now to be pretty sure she knows what has happened, though."
529,I don't understand how he needs 5-6 hours but snoozes for an hour. is he going to bed at 2-3 am?
530,"I don’t think it’s morally wrong, but it seems sketchy. Especially the way you’re describing it. You “gave in” to dating him, after you planned to end it in two months? Nothing about that makes you sound excited. The whole maturity talk he gave you is pretty standard grooming stuff, and just it sound like hes into the taboo of the age difference, even if he doesnt like it publicly. Plus, you’ve stated your reason for agreeing to be romantic is to preserve friendship?? Very big red flag that you feel you have to be sexual/romantic in order for him to WANT to be your friend. You should be careful with this guy. 

I was briefly with someone quite a bit younger than me. We were friends first, and never highlighted the age difference because we saw each other as equals. Your situation seems more like he’s being predatory, especially considering it seems like it started when you were a minor. Please be careful."
531,"&gt; don’t believe she is “perfect” but more like she is perfect for me. 

The point u/LilStabbyboo is trying to make (I think) is that you don't know that. Your limited interactions with her have lead you to believe this, but you don't know if she goes home and kills puppies at night or shoots heroin.  Does she pay her bills on time? Is she a total slob at home? Does she abuse her siblings? How does she handle stress, does she take it out on those closest to her or does she drink too much?

You only know the side of her you've seen. Getting to know someone, really know them, takes time (like a year +) and being allowed into their inner world. You haven't had either of those things. So thinking she's ""perfect"" for you is fantasy based on just the little bit of information you have about her. Not about the whole, real her."
532,"I get the impression you may be too cautious as a driver. This can be even more dangerous than fast drivers, as they tend to by hyper focussed on one thing (ie speed), and less aware of what is going on around them. 4 accidents don't just happen. I wouldn't drive with you either.

On the plus side, south is like you have a chauffeur"
533,Possible she feels more relaxed around you.  I used to have a weird type of tic that happened mostly when I was with friends.  It normally didn't happen if I was in more professional environments or with strangers if I was cautious about suppressing it.
534,"You're under no obligation to hang out with people that seem to want to use you as designated babysitter so they can get shitfaced. It's OK to want to hang out with your family. You'll make new friends in university too, probably. Though some of them may also be into partying, I'm sure you'll find others that aren't."
535,Is her boyfriend’s name George Costanza?
536,"I didn't go with my gut....... got married, then divorced a year later.

Wish I did things the way you did.

Go with your gut, it knows in the long run."
537,"And if she’s worried about the pictures, she can ask a bridesmaid to drop out—because she seems like someone who would see that as an actual solution rather than sucking it up, understanding the situation and maybe sending the brother’s girlfriend some flowers at the hospital."
538,This is why a lot of people can't stay friends with exes. It hurts to see a person who was an important part of your life move on.
539,"Do not move in with her, my guy. She's going to be bringing around the kind of men you hate constantly. You're going to hate it."
540,"To understand I think you need to ask her WHY you doing these things upset her.

I’m similar to your girlfriend in that I have episodic health issues that impede my ability to function normally. It’s incredibly frustrating and disheartening. I’m angry with my body not functioning as I feel it should. And sometimes if my husband has this “everything will be fine” attitude it feels dismissive in a way. Maybe that’s unfair, but sometimes their positive attitudes push me even further to anger.

What seems to be missing for you is her ability or willingness to be honest and say, “I’m pissed off because I want to be able to participate in our life and I don’t feel like I can”. Right now you’re the enemy instead of her illness. If this is going to work, she needs to turn to you for support. 

Maybe acknowledging her feelings and chilling it on the optimism will help. Either way, she needs to express her feelings in a more productive manner for this relationship to work."
541,"My feeling is:

Not putting keys back is maybe a small thing. On the other hand, after I've loaned you my car, when I'm late for work and need to hustle, I will be livid if my keys are not where they should be and I'm wasting precious time turning the house upside down because *you* might know they're on the table but I don't so I need to check all the places they could be while I'm trying to get tf out of the house. 

And after that above scenario has happened once, every episode of keys-not-back is going to piss me off because I'm going to remember how stressed I was when I was looking for my gd keys. And you being careless with my keys kinda feels like you don't think my job is important, or you don't think it's important to treat my stuff well. 

Flying off the handle at every little thing is maybe an overreaction, but it also doesn't hurt to think about what kind of thought process is driving your actions. If your boss loaned you a car, would you leave those keys on a random surface?"
542,"Lmao, I honestly cannot believe you are upset / complaining about this. Act your age buddy"
543,"Get loans and get the hell out of that house as soon as you can. 

Your mom is nothing but a danger to you."
544,"Oh no. I personally love San Francisco's Chinatown and went when I was young so I know there is plenty of innocent fun to be had there but if he has a history of all those things then I see how much more alarming this is

Hes dishonest but I really hope you can get the truth if you present him with the proof you already have. Im really sorry hes put you in this spot"
545,"Yeah my BF actually got angry at me for cutting myself down.  Saying i was not allowed to talk about his GF that way.  It made me take a step back.  I am also working on self love.  Im not fat, but i still have my hangups."
546,You are way too young to be putting up with this bullshit
547,"I'm so sorry this happened to you. I know how much it sucks to be told you're not sexually attractive to someone. Thing is, different people find different features attractive, it doesn't mean you're unattractive, it just means this person wasn't right for you."
548,"those famous bands also know when their band practice is scheduled so they're not cancelling on someone 45 minutes beforehand. either they're deciding to have a practice last minute, which puts it more into the hobby category, or he knew about it and didn't manage his time properly."
549,"You have FIVE KIDS all of whom are HOME FOR THE SUMMER and you wonder what she's doing all day? Are they all still alive and have the same number of limbs as they did when you left in the morning?

That is what she's doing, man. I'm exhausted just thinking about it.

Also, after 16 years out of the workforce, if she gets a job, will it cover the cost of even one kid's all-day babysitting? Will it cover after-school for the other four once school's in session? It might not be in anyone's best financial interest for her to work until all the kids are in all-day school."
550,"Please. It's only been a year and a half and these people are rushing to the altar already--this isn't a relationship that's been going strong for years. He's shown he can't be relied on when times get tough. So she shouldn't rely on him. She DEFINITELY should cancel this wedding, even if she decides to stay with him and eventually get married after all. On a fundamental level he thinks she's lazy and has no work ethic, who'd marry someone who thinks that about them?"
551,You might want to look into critical illness insurance before he considers getting the test done. This would help you have more resources to pay for care assistance if he needs it later on.
552,Maybe I can't imagine my life without him because he's kept me from having free time for the last 2 years 😓 like I wouldn't know what to do with myself because currenty all I do is work and see him (as of the last month I've just been working myself to death) and I'd have all the time in the world to do other things
553,"I totally agree. As a 25 years old I already start to value health, safety, time spent with loved ones, and time in general, more than money. if you choose to waste more than two hour a day just on the commute, when you have other easily affordable options, then OP you should try to get over the financial security and prioritize your life."
554,Great comment!  Very true about the purposeful addicting nature of many of those games. It’s always made to feel like you’re soo close to hitting the jackpot.
555,This happened to me. I looked at the uber driver “like I wanted to have sex with him.”
556,"ah it seems your friend is “suffering” from one of my favorite weird psychological disorders: munchausen’s syndrome! if you do a lil research you’ll see that this is a well documented phenomenon where someone makes themselves ill, or makes them appear to be ill, in order to gain attention and sympathy or in part of a larger fraud. there’s also munchausen’s syndrome by proxy wherein a caretaker chooses another person to make sick or appear to be sick. very interesting! and not at all a person I would want to be very close to."
557,"Oh my god, I'm not crazy, I thought exactly the same. Support group or what."
558,That’s my thought on where OP’s BF was at that hour and in that area
559,100% gives me the heebie jeebies
560,"Didn't you read? It was his bandmate's birthday. He can't skip *that*.


#rolllllllleyes"
561,"&gt;I recently moved into a house I bought with her.

Another example of the perils of buying property with someone who is not your spouse."
562,"Stop having sex with her unless you want to be a dad. 

You’re not being paranoid, you are correctly identifying some massive red flags."
563,"Even if you don't want children, this seems like a bad sign. 

What if you get sick or injured? Will he treat you as gross now? 

Can you introduce him to your family? Will he think that your aunt is worth less as a person because she brought your nephew into the world? Will he make weird comments about their marriage being sexless?"
564,"I was coming here to say this. There is no difference between a mental health issue and something physical. There is no choice between either. If she was in and out of the hospital for two years due to a ""physical"" illness would this even be a question?"
565,"Women have organs called spermathecae that store the sperm, allowing them to fertilize eggs for multiple pregnancies after just one instance of sexual intercourse.

Wait, no, that’s insects."
566,"What the heck.  This is such bullshit.  If you have trouble being monogamous don’t enter a monogamous relationship.  There’s no excuse for cheating, and no reason anyone should put up with that disrespect.  And he is straight up lying to her! The idea of Unconditional love is garbage."
567,"""Anger problem."" An abuser loves phrases like ""anger problem,"" ""alcohol problem"", ""jealousy problem,"" ""communication problem"", like it's something he and his victim can tackle together if she'd just stay under his control a little longer. The problem is always him and his abuse. In ""Why Does He Do That?"", Lundy Bancroft points out that abusive men often don't have these ""problems with anger"" when it comes to friends, family, and coworkers. They come from all walks of life; they are lawyers, judges, cops... And their acquaintances will swear up and down that he isn't like that. If he doesn't blow up at his boss like he does at OP, then obviously he can control it. And if he blows up at *everyone* this way? Bye Felicia! There's no way you're fixing that shit with a 12-step ""admit you have a problem"" plan."
568,"&gt; Is there any way I can stay with him?

Of course! You can ignore all good sense, block your eyes and cover your eyes and sing ""Not happening!"" at the top of your voice.

Or...

Or you could actually pay attention to what's going on and stop burying your head in the sand. You know what's happening and no amount of denying it is going to change the fact. You don't trust him, you don't respect yourself, you don't pay any attention to reality. If you do, you're trying to resist it every step of the way. What has to happen here? Does he actually have to fuck her right in front of you before you accept what's going on? Hopefully it never requires that much before you get the point."
569,"Using a phone number as a contact name? She’s pretty clever. But it also backfired.

You handled this well. Don’t let him make you feel bad for wanting proof. It hurts for him to think his gf doesn’t trust him, and that’s understandable, but when someone gives very valid looking evidence, it’s only human to take a pause and consider it.

If every person who trusted their SO had an innate ability to know if they did or did not cheat for sure, this sub would be a ghost town."
570,"Honestly, if it were me I'd be seeing the feeling he's having as a huge red flag and take the hit to end the relationship.

If he is unsure about how he's feeling about you this early in the relationship, then that is just going to build and fester into something much bigger down the line."
571,Yup.  OP got picked up in a bar and went on a date with the guy.
572,We haven't set a time yet to get the test. He wanted to tell first because he wanted the support. Also he has to be careful because a positive Huntingtons diagnosis can prevent him from getting life insurance and health care. We are looking for ways to do it anonymously.
573,"This is NOT your business. You should not have been thrust into it in the first place and should stay completely out of it now. If your parents are confiding in you about any of this or making it even remotely your responsibility, that is wildly inappropriate."
574,"&gt;He has a tendency to black out when he drinks

That's a drinking problem, and a big one."
575,"I don't really know how because I'm blocked from her Facebook, and she isn't answering my texts which makes me think I might be blocked there too. 

I don't know if her bf or she blocked me, but I'm thinking it's him."
576,"Call her other friends, call her parents, call his parents, literally anything you can do to get a message across. This girl is 19, too young for her life to spiral like this but also might be too young to save herself."
577,You're assuming op didn't mention or hint at mentioning being worried about cheating.
578,"I'm impressed by this phrasing because I definitely wouldn't have been able to put it so tactfully

The best part is that it's 100% true - you really do like her, it's just the romantic/sexual part that isn't there"
579,"(Kind of a comment to address all of the commenters concerned with the cheating possibility. Thank you so much for your thoughts,  I think that kind of separation of which parts I should worry about is what I needed.)

Haha definitely didn’t intend on burying the lede. While when it was happening, I did my fare share of freaking out over it and (mentally) jumped to all of the worst conclusions. I just considered the girl thing kind of “dealt with” (just not dealt with enough to omit I suppose). We had a discussion about it and he emphasized that he was just trying to people-please and make friends (very believable for him), and I made the choice to trust him because I know that trust comes with the territory of a LDR and I was trying to be ~adult~ about my need for attention. Plus, he’d never given me another reason to not trust him. (Was this naïve?)

When we discussed the phone issue, he briefly showed the conversation to me and it seemed like long texts of getting to know each other, asking about why they’re doing their majors, etc. Not preferable because of what you said about emotional energy (thank you for making me think about it that way!) but nothing explicitly flirtatious. And he’s 100% the type to want to people-please and (I believe, at least) truly not the type to cheat—he’s childish, but loyal. Also, I think he’s been trying to spend less time with her recently and developed a friendship with a guy that I actually happen to know, which I took to be a good sign?

Also, I actually TOTALLY agree that monthly anniversaries are childish (it feels like new parents who say their kid is 52 months old—no, Karen, your son is FOUR). It was just a silly little thing that he did to show his excitement for us, and the change bothered me, but I think you’re right about me needing to let it go as part of adult life. I’m learning so much through you guys!"
580,Why even bother snoozing if you have to get out of bed anyway? This is kinda ridiculous.
581,"This crosses way into ""get a lawyer and a therapist"" territory. You've been betrayed by the two people you cared about the most. They've both decided to do something they knew would push you out of their lives, and despite their attempts to placate you (ie absolve themselves of guilt), it's NOT a good idea for you to stay in their lives or give them ANY satisfaction of knowing you're ""okay"" with them dating. You're not, and you shouldn't be, and that's okay.

You have a lot of shit to figure out, and i'm glad you've got other people in your life who can help you.

I'm sorry your relationship ended this way. Get as many people in your corner as possible (again, a therapist, and someone to help you through the division of the house/other shared assets) and don't feel as though you need to give either of them anything at this point. If you feel, down the road, like you want to talk to them about any of this, that's up to you, but you don't owe either of them shit.

The audacity and cruelness of telling you via text message means they were both too chickenshit to take your actual feelings into account. And the fact that your ex is trying to justify it by saying ""don't you want me to be happy?"" is outrageous. An emotional, or potentially even physical, affair is not ""yeah, babe, chase your bliss."" She was cruel and thoughtless and cold by pursuing this relationship and you're allowed to be mad at her."
582,"Yes you should, she deserves more than what you are giving her"
583,All bullshit. Especially Uber. They stand to lose money every time they report inaccurate trips. They make sure their trips are accurate almost all the time.
584,"&gt;our infidelity secrets.

Your title says ""our"" infidelity but you are the only cheater in this story.   She went out with another guy while you guys were on a break so she did not cheat.   And then she got raped and you have the nerve to call it ""our infidelity"".   

If she wants to make this work then the two of you need to go to marriage counseling to work through this.   If she doesn't want to make this work then you need to do everything in your power to make the separation as easy as it can be."
585,"My Asian mom has disowned me so many times and me her, but she couldn't stay away lol. We're fine right now in the end and have a decent relationship."
586,"Yeah we are currently existing. I would love to be living again. Thrive even.

Most of our things are in storage so I'll have to have him ship them, to where, I dont know yet. The car we have isn't able to tow a moving trailer.

I have an obgyn appt Friday and will leave after the appt.  I'm unemployed but have a college education. The pregnancy complicates things. The whole thing is depressing. I often feel like he takes advantage because of my lack of options."
587,"There’s a ton of strip clubs on Broadway right by that area. Maybe he spent some time over there. Idk if that’s considered cheating on your end, but definitely a possibility."
588,"Oh good, her brother is a dipshit who can’t plan ahead either. 

None of this obligates you to take those cats. She’s a big girl and this is a test of grown-up priorities. She’s gonna have to make a decision based on the options available to her."
589,"This is a good point I'm sure even if she did come she would have been miserable. I don't think she would have caused a scene but she probably would be visibly having a bad time, which would have made me concerned for her instead of enjoying the wedding."
590,"There are a lot of problems here. First of all, what your MIL says shouldn't matter (besides understandably being annoying and hard to live with). It shouldn't impact your decisions. If your husband is putting pressure on you because his mother is putting pressure on him, he's got issues and needs to get a spine. 

You have *so many* reasons to not have a child right now, that it seems crazy to even consider the idea. You're only 29, you are NOT running out of time, you and your husband don't both have health insurance, you are struggling financially, *and you live in a tiny apartment with his terrible, terrible parents!* If your husband honestly thinks it's reasonable for you to get pregnant right now, he's being extremely unreasonable. OBVIOUSLY you have to be living independently for this to even become an option. 

But even if you didn't have all these reasons, it's still shitty for him to be pressuring you into something you don't want. It's not his body that will be impacted. He's not the one taking on all the risks. 

I would:

* Tell him the answer is no as long as you live with his parents and you will not be discussing this again, period
* Focus on trying to get the hell out of there as soon as possible, with or without him
* Get couples counseling 

If he won't agree to all this, you should save yourself."
591,Good advice! I feel like I was in OPs shoes w their ex. I try to look at sex w my SO now like how you said it definitely helps
592,"If he threatened take the dog if you leave him then I'm pretty sure he is capable of something violent. When he's away leave him a good bye letter and take your things and the dog. Get far away and don't look back. You're 20, very young, don't waste your life with this loser"
593,Use them to build a kite and fly out of there :)
594,"Yeah, I always think the best way to address these types of situations is to talk it out. OP should show him this entire thread to show objective concerns."
595,"That’s super, super shitty. He’s a grown man and he can make his own breakfast. Demanding you do it and then insulting you in an extremely targeted and personal way when you don’t immediately comply was cruel and intentional."
596,"The vast majority of people who will say they love you after a few days or a week, are either manipulators, future-fakers, or people with really extreme psychological or emotional issues. 

This guy sounds like a future-faker. He enjoys the thrilling beginning of a fake relationship. My best guess is he's in a relationship or living with someone."
597,"Yeah, I honestly barely read past the ages and the first few sentences. He's a lying jackass who is dating a woman in her early 20s because he knows he has a better chance of manipulating her than he does with a woman his own age."
598,Break up with her.  Find a therapist to help you figure out why you chose to live as a doormat for years.
599,"You are under-reacting. That was horrifying and he expressed a willingness to do violence to you and use any possible future children as weapons against you. You need to end the relationship. And although the choice is yours absolutely, I think he has just proven beyond the shadow of any doubt, that he is not a safe person to co-parent with.

You weren't being childish. You were taking the first step to protecting yourself."
600,"I was in a gaming degree program for a while and that is literally what they shove down the throats of the students. ""Do extra tasks, look good for management"" and then they recruit from these schools and tell the schools what they are looking for: worker bee drones who will do whatever they ask."
601,I am exhausted and worse off for having read through this absolute shit show.
602,Best comment here for sure.
603,Four months and your post history contains enough toxic drama for two lifetimes. Just break up ffs
604,"That...makes no sense.  I mean, if Katie were a reindeer, you wouldn't think twice about it, either.

Unless he's into bestiality, in which case you *would* be worried.

Your bf is not gay and he's not bisexual, yes?  Then OF COURSE you wouldn't worry about cheating with a man!

Honey, deceiving yourself about the situation isn't even bringing you any comfort in the short term, so why not try being clear-eyed?  I think your bf is looking to have two gfs right now, and you need to understand that and see it for what it is."
605,"I agree with /u/katie1068. I’m worried she may have some kind of eating disorder. 

Tell her you smelled a foul odor coming from the room and wanted to find the source. It may be hard for her to open up to you if it is indeed an eating disorder. If she does, help her find a therapist or compile a list of groups that she could go to talk. Best of luck."
606,"Has she been diagnosed with bipolar disorder?
The highs and lows, with the manic spending and then insecurity/fighting is deeply troubling"
607,Take him to first aid. Having a knife in your hand and blood in your eyes can't be good.
608,"He didn't just say that the guy didn't seem the type, though. 

&gt;That the fact that it waited this long to say anything, and only said something to prove a point in a conversation, made it hard to believe.

He straight up accused his girlfriend of lying about sexual assault to win an argument. That's a hell of a lot more than just having difficulty assimilating new information about a friend."
609,I highly doubt all they did was made out.
610,"He blames everyone but himself for his past behaviours. That's one giant red flag. Whatever he did was bad enough to land him on these court ordered courses. Second giant red flag. He is blatantly downplaying what he did. Third giant red one. He is using whatever he learned on these courses to manipulate you. Fourth giant red flag. He got physical with you, pregnant woman, triggered by some extremely unimportant stuff. Now that flag is so giant you could confuse it with planet Mars.

Now, many abusers are all lovey dovey at the beginning of the relationship, starting with violence only when they feel sure the woman won't dump their sorry ass immediately. Moving in together, engagement, getting married or pregnant are such milestones that make them sure. There always is the first time, but it is never the last one.

Now, imagine that soon you will be living with this man and a baby, noisy little creature that will get most of your attention. You will not be in a mood for sex, you will be tired and you will have to deal with a violent dude, triggered by, well, basically anything. Sounds like hell? 

It should.

Reconsider your relationship with this man. If you decide to leave do it either when he is not around or have someone big and strong with you."
611,"Stopping on a yellow is attentive and careful, but it’s really dangerous if the rest of traffic is expecting you to cross on a yellow. That’s how you get rear-ended. IMO good driving is about being proactive. As the light is turning yellow, you should actively check what’s going on with traffic BEFORE making the decision to stop or cross."
612,"Right. This is an *expenses* problem, and she needs to adjust to the new reality of how much money you guys are making."
613,"No.
If he needs help packing, he can bring friends, he can rent a uhaul, he can hire professionals. He could have done this ages ago. Let him call the cops; better yet, you call the cops and see if you can arrange for someone to be present to avoid issues. Some police depts will do that to avoid a domestic."
614,"The sensible option is to stop playing with him. There are few things which sap more joy from a game than raging assholes like your boyfriend. There's simply no fun to be had in being constantly berated and shouted at. Besides, his *trying to make you better* is just a bullshit excuse to shout at you. Saying he's doing this for your well being? Seriously? He said that with a straight face?

Let's hope he's not as bad in general life. As it is, if his behavior while gaming reflects anything of what he's like elsewhere you really need to bail."
615,"Yes! Yes, the age gap at your age is too much. You say you just wanted something casual and now he’s trying to push you into something more. Just say No, be firm. Say you are too young and aren’t ready to be entering into a serious relationship at this point.  Stay strong"
616,"This - focus on the phone records - and *as others are saying* \- **you need to view them on the provider's website - not a printout he may have edited.**

Sorry it looks like he is liar - silver lining in the situation (he is lying or he has lying ex) is that their accounts are so different and revolve not around the text messages content but around their mere existence.

In other words the ex's allegation of these text messages existing and his 'just an awkward greeting' account of their contact turn this is into a simple test solvable by phone company records (assuming these are old school SMS messages - if on a messaging app then a bit more complicated). SMSes exist - then that and tattoo have your BF as the definite liar."
617,"&gt;Using a phone number as a contact name? She’s pretty clever. But it also backfired.

Yeah, shit. You can tell she gets away with things like this all the time if she's got something like that in her back pocket."
618,"I have a feeling that it was an abridged version of the chat and that she was, rightfully, grilling him and he said that he didnt cheat in so many words and context but OP just wrote it like that for brevity.

Either way I agree, he either cheated or maybe ""fell off the wagon"" depending on what that history OP mentioned, was."
619,"This might just not be the right partner for you.

Frankly, holding on to or misplacing someone else's keys or cards is something you absolutely need to get a grip on. It's not at all comparable to misplacing your own shit. This needs to be a high priority correction for you, because even if her reaction is much too intense, these are legitimate things to experience stress and frustration over. I think you need to do a better job of understanding the impact of your actions.

If my partner was repeatedly not putting my car keys back in my hands, or back in the place they belong where I can find them immediately, it would stress me the hell out and undermine my trust in a big way. Once or twice is human. More than that would leave me feeling uncared for and disrespected too.

Get conscious about this. If you truly cannot do so, you should talk to a mental health professional and acquire some tools and skills to improve your ability to be conscious of this. 

None of what I said above tho means that this is a good relationship for you. You're feeling shut down and insecure. Those are major issues as well. She may have her own issues that mean this is not a good fit."
620,"For the first three, the distinction of you being legally not at fault doesn't really mean much because in the majority of situations, if you are rear-ended it is automatically considered to be the other person's fault. Also, I understand that it was your first week of driving, but technically you weren't following all of the rules of the road in the first accident. You're not supposed to decelerate before entering the exit lane. Whenever you're changing lanes you're supposed to maintain speed and then decelerate once in the exit lane. And as many people have already said, even if the accidents weren't your fault, he is not obligated to let you drive him. You have the option to accept his boundary or take your own car."
621,dude... you might be certified blind and deaf.
622,Self control while drinking is something that would help here majorly
623,"For the scheduling, have you tried sharing a Google calendar? That's what my husband and I do, and it fixed the ""why didn't you tell me you had X meeting???"" problem for us."

625,"She could be mature for her age. 

But no amount of majurity can make up for lack of real world life experience. She simple doesn't have it. Without that experience she can't readily figure out what is normal or not in a relationship. And that's what older creeps want."
626,Sounds like an episode of broad city
627,"See a grief counselor.  Put that $10k towards therapy.

No one can make you feel anything and if you're in a place where her jabs don't hurt you then maybe you can have her in your life without detriment.

Be aware that all the energy and time you put into her is time and energy you could be putting into finding people who love and care for you in a healthy way."
628,I called the old number in front of him and some old lady answered in Mandarin.
629,"He's a great kid, and I'm so proud of him. A friend made a good point to me today, ""You've really hard to raise him well, and you've done a great job. Do you want to sacrifice the stability that you've worked so hard to maintain, just when he needs it most, becoming a teenager ?"" 

Ok that a wasn't verbatim, but the gist is there! I really, really want to raise him well and be a good mom. Difficult choices become easier when I'm firm on that goal."
630,"I mean, there's nothing about the label GF that'll stop her doing that anyway, so you're looking for a false sense of security here. Pushing her on this like you have been is probably turning into one of the red flags she's been looking for, because you're not listening to her wishes or respecting her boundaries, just pushing your own. Stop doing that immediately if you're serious about not wanting to lose her."
631,I live in San Francisco and sorry to break this to you but nobody walks around Chinatown at night. Everything is closed and it is sketchy.
632,"She DID reach out to you, and you haven't responded. Yes, you were on your honeymoon then, but you're not now. She probably thinks you're ignoring her message, and she's being respectful of your boundaries by not harassing you with further messages."
633,"Omg I used to habe a friend that is exactly like Betty. I remember once we were talking with a small group of close friends and I told them that after I was caught self injuring I was send to a mental health facility for a week and was keeping with regular appointments. Well, this other girl shows up a week after and tells us that she was caught vomiting and was being sent to have one meal a day in a hospital to make sure she was eating. (Later I found out that it was impossible because in our town there isn't any hospital that makes this thing of getting their patients to come eat a male a day). Also one friend told us that his sister's boyfriend moved in with them and he was being in meds because of a mental health (she told us that to make me feel better, like a lot of people have mental health issues and it's more common of what I think). Guess what. A week after her parents are diagnosed with a mental health (doesn't specify) and are going to a psychiatrist. When one of our friends explained us that she had sex for the first time, so did the other girl. When I started dating someone, she did start dating someone. Also she always explained me stories on how she got an anxiety attack in the middle of a party or whatever and when we would ask people who were in the party with her none knew what we were talking about.
And the worst one: I was abused by someone close to my family. I was devastated and I told two of my friends. Like I couldn't really explain what happened to my family (because that person was a close member) so I went to my friends. One of this friends told this one girl (learned to not trust anyone I guess) and a week after she says that she was raped in a party. Like I wasn't raped or anything. But I guess she always feels the need to come up with something similar of what happened to us but worst.
At first I was like you, I didn't want to believe that someone was capable of coming up with this type of stories for no reason (except that they wanted attention). But sadly it is true, people are capable of lying about this stuff. If all that she explains doesn't make sense it is probably because she is making it all up.
(And btw instead of answering you I ended up explaining my story sorry about that but they were too similar and I was just trying to prove s point)."
634,"I don't think it's about the fact that he's avoiding tests so much as that he literally stated that he didn't care if he could pass this disease to his children, because he needs to reproduce 'biologically' (apparently this also includes IVF, even though that'd still be biologically his own). If he was confused, in doubt or unsure, I'd have much more sympathy for him but him stating his case so strongly tells me that he's not any of that, he's just selfish."
635,"End it, he is flaky af"
636,"I don't understand this. She did reach out to you. She probably knew you were on your honeymoon and didn't want to call you unexpectedly. You say that you are empathetic and understand her mental illness, but I don't think you do. In hindsight she shouldn't have accepted the role as your bridesmaid. Perhaps she very much wanted to and thought she had the strength to do this for her friend and didn't want to disappoint. People with chronic anxiety often have trouble confronting people, let alone disappointing them. It sucks that your friend wasn't there for your wedding, but honestly you sound like you have no idea what she's going through."
637,"That's quite a conclusion to leap to? I fell that just because someone is not AS emotionally available to you as they used to be, does not mean they are more emotionally committed to someone else."
638,"Chassis quality doesn't tend to degrade over time. It doesn't make any difference to crash safety if the engine is crap or the transmission is on its way out. Op said she drove an old car that she wasn't going to spend money repairing, but y'all are acting like she's driving a teetering wreck with its wheels held on by string."
639,"Just to clarify, to prioritize your scheduled talk your boyfriend could have: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. woken up earlier 

2. skipped band practice 

3. gone to band practice but skipped the lunch afterwards

&amp;#x200B;

Instead he did none of those things and messaged you last-minute and blew you off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think he knows the talk is likely to lead to a breakup and is avoiding you for that reason."
640,"&gt; I don’t see how someone can be so transactional and cold with someone you’re supposed to love.

I agree with this.  I think 50/50 early in a relationship is fine but after 3 years and this level of income disparity, I can't understand this guy."
641,"This is really the only answer you need to read, OP."
642,"I'm confused why you think not getting better = not getting help?

that's extremely simplistic. You can be trying your hardest and still get worse.


The fact that you mentioned inpatient care makes me feel like you don't know much about mental health conditions, as most leading psychatrists say that it actually leads to lower rates of recovery and lower long term outcomes."
643,I know.. I agree.. I just don't know how to confront him.
644,There are other reasons for choosing the bus as well.... The enviroment!
645,"If he's not on title for the property, or on any lease, feel free to tell him in writing that he can come pick up his items on X day at X time or organize for the items to be shipped or delivered somewhere else, and that after Y days, you are donating or throwing things out. If he shows up at other times, you can call the cops for trespass. 

The other option, which is pricier but might give you some peace of mind, is to place all the items into a storage unit and pay for one month. Give him access to it but tell him after one month you will no longer be paying for the unit. 

You might also want to pass this by r/legaladvice."
646,"Remember that before you met her, you thought you would never meet anyone like her. So now there is the possibility that someone else exists who you never thought you would meet/could feel like that for...who might return the feelings too!"
647,"Are you my other sister? Lol cause my sister had something similar happen to her. Her boyfriend basically stopped coming by after they had a fight about something after always being around, he would still text her. Everytime she tried to meet up with him it was another excuse. She finally had to breakup with him over text. It was the only way to get closure."
648,"&gt;you’re going to look back on this post and shake your head at how terrified you are right now. Because by then you’ll know the fear was gone the moment you actually got away.

Exactly that. Get out of there op, you're stronger than you think!"
649,"&gt; They....want.....you....to ..... be ...ok.... with.... them....dating.

I can't even."
650,This really stuck out to me too. OP is getting reluctantly dragged along in every aspect of this relationship.
651,"&gt;Why take a cab to walk? 

Isn't that called sight seeing?  When I was in NY we took a cab from our hotel room to walk around the Statue of Liberty and Central Park, but not at night.

Maybe he needed alone time, but after reading some of the comments are you even sure he really had an interview there?  Or did he just take the interview there to go crazy like this in SF?  Goodness help ya if he got a job there. Yikes!"
652,"I'm not sure what famous bands you think I'm talking about. 

A hobby is a hobby unless it becomes your job. He made a commitment and then he decided to schedule band practice to avoid her. I don't think that a hobby is ever a good excuse to treat someone with disrespect, even if it does become lucrative enough to be a job. Who said it wasn't real life?"
653,"Not only now. Any time I've ever mentioned that she could contribute she takes it as a personal attack and that it would somehow lessen her as a mother. 

She is closed minded when I ask how neighbor x or y does it. Are they less of moms?  Am i less of a dad because I work?  

It is as though our situation can't adapt or change?  10 years ago I worked at this company where my buddy and I worked from 5 am to 1:30.  His wife worked from 1:30-8 and he'd have their kids (same age as mine) my wife would talk down to their situation and how it is sad that she works. WTF"
654,"&gt; When she first text you about that, you should have shut her down hard and stopped responding (and limit contact with her). Instead you played along, didn't tell your boyfriend, allowed him to be subjected to her toxicity (again), and here you are.  
  
This. I actually had to roll back up to check the age cause this whole situation sounds like the kind of drama teenagers would have, not adults.  
  
Why would OP ever go along with the messages? That wasn’t some clever plot to get her best friend off her back, it was just taking part of an immature game. OP had so many chances to clear it up too.  
  
Could’ve just said that you don’t cheat, close your phone and ignore rest. Could’ve simply just you know, not answer anything at all in first place. Could’ve set the record straight next day that no, obviously you weren’t gonna do something like that. Could’ve told your boyfriend what happened, in form of venting about your friend if nothing else.  
  
OP definitely has contributed to her own situation and as much as her ”best friend” doesn’t act like a friend at all, it’s not all on her shoulders."
655,"It sounds like her mental health issues are pretty severe.  I personally think that mental health issues are real health issues.  If your friend had appendicitis, would you still be mad that she couldn’t show up to the wedding?

You’re not obligated to be her friend, but I would much rather have a bridesmaid have a panic attack at home instead of the actual wedding in front of all the guests."
656,"This 100000%.

I had a friend for 20 years.  We lived together for a few, he was very dear to me.  He was often sick (I knew, I lived with him), but he had a job and made it work.  

In the last year, when he didn’t show for my birthday dinner I was worried.  I called him and he apologized, he took a work shift and forgot.  No worries, glad you’re ok.

A few months later, he was supposed to driving me to my bridal shower.  He texted my MOH the night before “is there a backup if I can’t make it?”  But didn’t back out.  I called him in the AM and eventually my fiancé took me so I wouldn’t be late.  He later said he was sick.  Sucks dude, I just wish you would’ve told me!!

My bachelorette comes up.  He ignores the group messages.  Finally MOH gets an OK to the train schedule, but he never shows.  He said his stepdad had a stroke.  Thing is, We we’re close with his family...they would’ve said something.  Weird vibes.

This pattern started to really suck.  I’d see him in between and everything would be great like it always was, so I just chalked it up to bad luck timing.

My wedding day.  He rsvpd yes with a +1.  We spoke about it, he was excited!  It was an amazing day.  Except someone and their +1 weren’t there.  They had seats at the table next to me with all my closest friends and it was...empty.   It made me sad.  At that point I decided my self care was worth more than reaching out.

I never heard from him after that.  From what I know some friends reached out to ask what happened.  I thought about calling him but...I was just so tired. I had given him the widest birth to support and felt taken advantage of emotionally (and then financially, 2 seats at a wedding?!).

A few months later he posted a generic fb comment acknowledging his anxiety.  I realized the people responding “yeah you’ve got this!” Hadn’t born the brunt of it.  I thought of replying angrily but didn’t.  That ship has sailed.  I just feel bad for him.

Take care of yourself first.  Hugs."
657,"Seems like she's not really a best friend to you at all - are you calling her that simply because you have a long social history?  It sounds like you don't really like her that much already, and I certainly wouldn't be able to tolerate the drama or her speaking poorly about my SO.  No harm in taking a break from her.

I'd also consider agreeing on some communication discipline with your gf - grievances from your relationship to your friends should come from you, not from her.  That's basically guaranteed to be drama, and it was."
658,"Attraction is different from validation, and it's wonderful that you want to be supportive. You've already been very supportive. One of the hardest things about being in a relationship with a trans person--both platonically and romantically--is that there are times when it is grossly unequal. There are times when it feels like it's always about them and their transition, and you're just there to hold them up. Mix that with former romantic feelings, and you've got yourself a guilt sandwich.

My advice? Agree to a temporary no contact period. Go like...a month or two without speaking. Take up a hobby. Both of you read the same book. Something like that. Then come back to each other and start the conversation with that. Then let it grow, or die, naturally.

This relationship has already gone through some really hard things. I can tell there's compassion here, and that's wonderful. But after so much, I think you both deserve some space for a bit. Take a breath. Clear the air."
659,"I mean, step one of this moving forward is to never give her any money again. Let the lights get shut off if you need to. Just keep saving and saving until you can move into your own place. And you need to call and cancel that credit card. If she has the details stored on a computer or whatever, she can keep using it. Make sure all your accounts are exclusively in your name.

The truth of it is, there is no way to stop what your mother has done from coming between the two of you. It's a pretty major violation, and it has had real consequences for your life. The best thing you can do is make sure it doesn't go any further, so that there is no more fuel added to the fire. Then, over time, you might find it easier to put it behind you. But it's okay to be pissed off, too. I would be."
660,"Also, I reckon people underestimate how much work a team can get done when its members all work together really well. Some of the most effective teams I've worked on involved people with average technical skill sets doing really cool stuff purely because of average and above-average leadership, social and communication skills."
661,"My girl, he's learned to stop being physically abusive (and breaking things IS physical) and learned how to be mentally abusive instead.  It's still abuse."
662,"I don't think it's out of line to talk to him with the context of his addiction and past: ""Look, I trust you implicitly, but admit that I'm nervous about your upcoming trip given your possible sex addiction and history with prostitutes. I know addictions are tough to cope with and I support you every step of the way. Having said that, I need to be clear for my own peace of mind that prostitutes or any other cheating when you're traveling is unacceptable."""
663,"&gt;  I don’t trust him with her

But...you don't.  **If you did, you wouldn't be here.** 

Look, they are going to do whatever it is that they want to do.  They will both reassure you that nothing will happen.  They will insist that nothing *is* happening.  I bet if you found them in bed together, they would tell you that it was all a terrible mistake and you'd forgive them.

An adult relationship isn't about endless understanding and tolerance.  An adult relationship has some pretty strict boundaries--you know the saying, ""Good fences make good neighbors?""  Well, *good boundaries make good relationships.*

You know something is up.  You are trying very very hard to deny that something is up.  Why is that?"
664,"The pregnancy may complicate things, but it can also make it easier to get social services if you need help with housing/food/medical while you transition to being on your own.  Just something to consider.  

I'm sorry you're going through this, if you ever want to vent or chat I'm happy to listen."
665,Your bf should come to the wedding but not be in the family photos.
666,"This isn't healthy in either direction. 

You shouldn't be a pushover, but a grown woman shouldn't be throwing fits to get her way.

Are you 100% sure that when you say no and stand firm, she doesn't go behind your back?"
667,"Totally agree with this post. It's amazing how night and day this post and the original one is. 

All BF had to do was take a tiny step forward (ring *shopping*) and two steps back (2 years delay) and she's over the moon. It's kind of sad to see how dependent OP is on her BF for her happiness, but I guess some people need to learn the hard way. 

I don't really know why she's posting on Reddit again to say nothing happened and continue to ignore advice."
668,"&gt;  Of course, talk to a lawyer in your jurisdiction.

This is the biggest thing the OP needs to do. Most states have a way for a presumed father to challenge paternity, but most also have a time limit to do so. A family law attorney in his states should have the answers to these questions."
669,That's what I keep telling myself. It's possible this isn't even an issue. But the fear of it is killing me
670,"&gt;but also said that if I loved her then I would want her to be happy and sometimes these feelings are uncontrollable.

Bullshit. This is just the sort of thing cheaters say to absolve themselves of guilt and put all the blame for hurt feelings on their victims. You are not required to feel anything she tells you to.

&gt; Both have said that I am very important to them 

So important that they knowingly betrayed you for *months*.

&gt;and they want to make sure I'm okay with them dating.

More cheater bullshit. It's not like they're going to stop dating if you say no. They just need you to be okay with it so that they can soothe their concience. ""We didn't do anything *that* bad if he's happy for us!""

But if you say no, the narrative is going to suddenly change to what a controlling self centered person you were and how you deserved to be cheated on.

The thing with cheaters is, you can't trust anything they say. They can't even be honest with themselves (or they wouldn't have cheated), and they fully believe their own bullshit justifications. So how can you get any real honesty from them?

&gt; On the other hand, they were honest with me 

Honest after intentionally and methodically lying to you for *months*

&gt;I can't help feel that Kate is right and I should let her love who makes her happy.

This is true. Everyone should be free to love whoever makes them happy. Doesn't give them a free pass to cheat on their partners. You can let her go without absolving her for her betrayal of you.

&gt;I don't know what choice I have.

Choose yourself. She didn't choose you. He didn't choose you. They're not on your side. They are not your people anymore. Be on your own side, find your true people - those who have your back. Rebuild a life that is stronger and better without them."
671,"I'm calling my alarm ""chime time"" from now on, thank you."
672,"Ick. He is so over-the-top. Groomsmen don't decide who makes toasts. Is he actually Michael Scott?

He wants a ""position of prominence""? This is not a thing. Feisty MILs shouldn't pull this stuff. Not-best-friends declaring legitimately anything at your wedding? Is bizarre. 

I would call and say, 'I value your friendship. I want you to be a part of my day. Further, I am planning this wonderful event with my fiancée and family. I would like you to be a part of our day.' Leave it at that. Is he seriously going to continue to whine that your actual BROTHER has a better role? If so, drop him. 

I think this friendship has been on its last legs for years."
673,"&gt;selfish. Statistically speaking she has spent thousands of dollars and done hundreds of hours of planning.

Which was her choice. Nobody is forced to have a ridiculously expensive, 3-ring circus wedding."
674,"That would make sense. 

But saying that you're taking it past a year after surgery really doesn't make much sense in this context right?"
675,"Yea, this is one of those ""can't make time for me I won't make time for you"" scenario. 

It's a pretty simple text: 

I understand your commitments so I won't let this one get in your way. I'm done. Contact me if you actually want to commit to getting your stuff. Otherwise, it's going out on the lawn."
676,"No, don't confront her while she's institutionalized.

Why confront her at all? What do you hope to get out of it?

Just break up and move on."
677,"&gt; I was honestly terrified because he seemed to really enjoy hurting me. I wonder if he thought it was okay to do those things because I went along with it?

Your gut is screaming at you that this is inappropriate and wrong. Follow your gut OP. This guy is another repetition of your previous abusive relationships. Do not see him again.

Have you talked to anyone about how to establish and maintain boundaries? I feel like you really need to gain confidence in doing that so you can avoid any more situations like this again."
678,"NO, she isn't turning you into an alcoholic.

All of us need to own and be responsible for what WE do.

If you become an alcoholic, that's on you, not this lady."
679,"Strap an iPad on the front, have brother attend by Skype."
680,"Seems inexperienced and awkward. 

Considering he's 18 it makes sense. 

You'd be better off going for a fwb who's as into you as you are to them.

Someone closer to your age/lifestage is going to be more experienced and able to understand how to give you what you want."
681,"If you want to date someone mature, might I suggest, staying away from teenagers?"
682,"It might be, but it's not the argument I made, so I'm not sure why you're telling me.

Putting your hobby over something you already committed to is shitty and disrespectful. He should support his girlfriend in trying to keep the relationship together."
683,"I don't really get this, though.  If I knew I'd be dying at 40 instead of 90 I'd want to plan my life and my spending and my world travel and my life experiences around that expected lifetime.  Why should I save up for a 401k or retirement if I won't get to use it? Why should I plan on waiting until retirement for world travel if I'll never get there?"
684,There's no way any girl could possibly live up to the fantasy of her you've obviously built up in your mind. Even if she did want to be with you it would end horribly because there's no place to go but down extra hard from a pedestal that high. No one is perfect.
685,"Either your friend group isnt really a friendship traditionally for you or you and your girlfriend are vastly different.

I know the friend group you speak of.  They obsess and make their entire personalities based around going to festivals and hiking/camping trips.  Those groups are usually awesome people to each other but are very inclusive of their own kind and not outsiders at all.  It seems this group may not care much about including your girlfriend because they dont see her as 'one of them.'

You might need to reevaluate your friends"
686,"just think: these thoughts will be gone in 3 months. the sooner you manage to accept the situation but also accept  that this situation won t last forever, you ll become more free again. 

ttust me. been there many times. after every relationship (i had the same thoughts) i met someone whi was even greater. imagine you re like an onion that s peeling off until you get to the true thing."
687,"I relate to you a lot. I’ve felt like this for a long time. I once cancelled a date with a girl purely out of anxiety about an hour before the date. It was dumb as shit. Only recently have I tried to make concrete changes, and that was after getting on antidepressants. Maybe a therapist or psychiatrist could help you out. I’m just trying to follow through with one on one meetings first. I would definitely cower out of group meetings. But it’s working - I actually made a new friend! And now we’re hanging out! And I’m trying to more intentionally have conversations with people, rather than letting them lead the conversation. I’ve often prided myself on being a “great listener” but I’m increasingly realizing that on some level, I was really just being a very quiet conversation partner that didn’t contribute much. I’m embracing small talk and asking more questions. That’s how I’m starting out on this end-my-antisocial-habit journey."
688,"Mental health issues are health issues. You wouldn’t be upset with her if she had gotten into a car accident or needed emergency surgery the day before your wedding and couldn’t make it. You would be disappointed in the situation but not at her. 

That said, if she’s fundamentally changed as a person or in what she’s capable of doing, of course that’s going to have an impact on the nature of your friendship"
689,"It's like people have forgotten the tried and somewhat tested (may be a little true) rule....""half the age + 7"". This does not pass that rule."
690,"You have nothing to get over. She was never your girl at all. You knew very little about anything to believe that she is perfect for anyone. You are creating things in your head. You cannot expect the image you’ve made in your own mind to be carried out by any physical being just because you’ve fabricated it in your brain. 

Besides you need to think before you seriously date! Relationships fail all of the time! They fail between day one and 50yrs after you have the first date. You may have one last eternity or a few days. How will you handle yourself then?"
691,"It’s not wrong to make decisions now. This situation right here, right now, is what these emotions are for. Right now they are trying to protect you and your child from an immediate, present danger. Do not promise yourself a complete resolution or “closure”, those are ways of trying to kid yourself into trying to recreate the life you thought you had with a person who does not exist, who was invented by someone consistently lied to you."
692,"So disrespectful. He’s probably hitting on them. I don’t know any other reason they’d pose for selfies with him...
To me sounds like a cheating time bomb. Some men in their 20s really do not have their shit together relationship-wise and can’t be very committed. Having a girlfriend and hitting on other girls is giving him maximum attention from women in general. 

Just my opinions though. If I were you I’d start doing the same on my own insta to see how he reacts and not be a nice girl about it."
693,"Im so sorry OP,

I know my comment is going to be lost at the bottom, &amp; you prob wont see it, but I still wanted to add my voice to the chorus of others trying to be honest &amp; supportive of you....

I wish I could say something that would help alleviate your pain - im sorry i cant 😔

Ive notices lots of ppl focusing on the fact he was out so long at night, taking a lyft, 'walking' pondering on drug/alcohol / cheating behaviour- &amp; that is *all* important stuff-....

 BUT- the thing that ***really*** stood out for me , was the fact he didnt answer your videocall with your child... im a mom &amp; a step mom, so i understand complex family dynamics- but i also understand how big /important video calls with a parent are- especially to very young kids.... *especially* when that parent is usually around, but isn't home tonight.... 

That set off like- the fireworks of red flags for me,  coupled with his ""poor girl"" reply- .... Im so sorry he has treated you/your family with such callous disrespect. ....

If he was having trouble sleeping, &amp; knew you were awake, why not just lay in his hotel bed alone, talking to you until he was tired enough ti drop off to sleep?? 

I know if i was away from my family overnight,  for any reason- i would have trouble sleeping too- but the thing that would bring me the most comfort, would be talking to / seeing them in a video call. .... (esp if thats already an established thing within your family!)
....

Idk what his past indescretions were, but if this was meant to be the time for your family to rebuild trust- i believe it was serious stuff- &amp; he is not taking it seriously enough.... ..

I dont knkw you or your family, but I do know what it is like to be up all night with your nerves &amp; anxiety in hyperdrive,  while your oartner is off fucking around, &amp; not even bothering to videocall the kids.... at a minimum, thats some serious selfishness.... but i feel like you already know what was *really* going on.... -&amp; now its time to work out what you want your next step to be, for you &amp; your child....

This is heavy, serious stuff, &amp; he needs to treat it as such, bot gaslight you &amp;make you feel like you're being unreasonable - i promise- you are not....

You need to taje care of your child, &amp; sometimes what is best fir the child, is for the parents to seperate, rather than trying to keep a relationship together 'for the kids' - 

Theres - so much wrong here....

I couldnt recommend seeing a counseller high enough- having an outside, objective person who you can be completely honest with, is absolutely a huge help..... sometimes it can take seeing a few ppl till you find someone you 'click' with,  but when you do, it is totally worth it!!

(&amp; if he suggests couples counselling, thats great! Go along if you feel you want to, just make sure its not your personal counseller that he wants to come see.... if he shows *any* sign of not wanting you to see a therapist on your own, that is another huge red flag.... )

....
Im sorry if i have written too much, or spoken out of place, if you've read this far down, thank you-

(I promise i didnt take time out of my day to write all this just to waste your time, or for no reason- I did it because i have been in some really shitty relationships, &amp; I simply didnt know just how bad they were until i was out of them, ... -&amp; because i want you to have a happy, safe, peaceful, honest home to raise your child in)

Once kids are involved, everythimg becomes a billion times more complicated - but as a mom- I know you will do the right thing by your child, even if it's incredibly hard &amp; painful for you - being a mom gives you super powers! Dont be afraid to use them!!

I wish you all the very best - with much love &amp; hugs!

❤💖💜💙💚💛"
694,"&gt;Any time I've ever mentioned that she could contribute she takes it as a personal attack and that it would somehow lessen her as a mother.

And you've continued to put up with it for sixteen years, so..."
695,"It’s valid to feel upset that you are the only person capable of contributing to a meaningful relationship.

OP never said they blamed her, or appeared to write off their mental illness, but instead asked if it was okay to feel down about things.

I’d say watching one of your most important relationships disintegrating is pretty devastating. And as someone who’s destroyed many relationships due to bipolar disorder, I get this."
696,"Does he know the messages are from before you guys even met/dated?

If he does, then he has problems. He has major insecurity issues but instead of addressing it he is blaming you for it. If he refused to go to counseling then this will not get any better.

Is he religious? Because if he's not then the only explanation is that he's misogynistic and controlling, as in he thinks you as a woman should not have any sexuality outside of him. If he is religious instead... Then it's a whole other can of worms.

Do you have any male friends or colleagues? How does he feel about them?"
697,"You can support someone but also expect them to skip non-essential activities when something important is happening. All that person meant was if the band isn't his career it's a hobby, and hobbies don't come before significant others."
698,"&gt;It's like someone being diagnosed with a chronic condition, refusing to properly treat it for years and then having an attack the day before the wedding. Yes, i would be upset at that because the person didn't properly take care of themselves

And that is indeed a little petty and self centered.

It's just a wedding. Her well being is a million times more important than her participating in a party."
699,"It would be one thing if he was at least giving off the actions of being in love with you/loving you, but it doesn’t even sound like he’s acting like he loves you. 

And two years is a really long time to sit and wait for someone’s emotions to build or change. I’m really sorry but I just don’t think he’s going to change how he feels about you."
700,Don’t let them go. These are red flags. Your sexual health is important and if he doesn’t respect now he won’t respect it later.
701,"&gt;  I just feel like I shouldn't have to tell him how to love me.

This is setting yourself for heartbreak and frustration. He can't read your mind and everyone is different.

There are couples who don't check in often and are happy.  You're dating a guy where that's what he's comfortable with, so you have to say ""This is what I need in a relationship"" and ask him what he needs and get everyone's needs met."
702,"Yeah strip club it was what I am assuming he did. Technically not “cheating” so he isnt lying but what the hell else is a man doing from that time in a foreign city.

Source: worked at a strip club. Big part of clientele was men traveling for work."
703,"I don't know how I'd cope with such a betrayal of trust. 
If you decide to stay with him, I'd suggest therapy to work though it all and rebuild your relationship.
If you decide to leave him, I'd suggest therapy to help you cope with the feelings of betrayal so that it doesn't carry over into your next relationship. 

Take care of yourself"
704,"Some people are really good at being there for you, but really bad at letting you be there for them.

Patience, compassion, love, and understanding are all you can offer her at this time."
705,"Sounds pretty irrational to me, but there's no harm in abstaining from sex for a few months and then getting retested after 90 days if she wants to be sure.  If she is looking to you for guidance, I'd suggest that and if she finds that she can't manage her anxiety in the meantime, then suggest therapy."
706,10-12 times a week is a heck ton!!! Don't let him guilt trip you for saying no when you guys are already have sex so often...
707,Venmo for a fucking ice cream date?? Jesus Christ..
708,"&gt;Bear in mind, looking after a small child while we both work full time is back breaking work: splitting up I don't even know what I'd do. He does a lot of childcare, and a lot of laundry and cleaning. He's aggressive and verbally abusive, but he doesn't believe women are shit or he's above housework or anything. He's not the typical asshole in this sub! I feel like if he had microdoses. Of a sedative in his neck or something, he'd be less awful, and my life more bearable.  

""He doesn't hate all women, he just hates *me*!"" Honey, I know it can be hard to leave something you've been in a long time. But your child deserves better than this. She will almost definitely get taken advantage of by some asshole in the future if you stay with him any longer. She's young now, it's likely she'll forget most of it if you leave now. 

You sound disgusted by him and want away from him. The money problems will sort themselves out if you respect yourself and your daughter over your asshole husband."
709,"I don't think his reaction is about you (both in a good sense and a bad sense). He's angry at your mom and reacting very strongly to the revelation about you. In his anger, he sees you and sees the infidelity and lies and his anger at your mom. So while it's good he's probably not angry AT you, it's also bad because he's so consumed by his anger and grief over the failure of his marriage that he is ignoring you as a person. He's being selfish and ignoring your feelings, but he's also going through a difficult time. Not everyone can handle a bombshell like this gracefully. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please remember that this isn't about you, it's about your mom. Hopefully your dad will realize that too and treat you the way you deserve to be treated."
710,I think many Christians assume other Christians are pretty much like them and don't really think about the wide variety beliefs and practices that all fall under the Christian umbrella.
711,"Have you considered trade school for him, like plumbing or HVAC? Or apprenticing as a locksmith? What about housekeeping in geriatric care facilities? It's not actually that demanding. Or maintenance in the same vein? I looked into moving to Canada (they dont want me, boo), but one of the areas where they need people is geriatric care facilities and maintenance at them is generally operating carpet cleaners, caulk, paint, moving furniture, etc. It doesnt usually require advanced technical skill or anything."
712,"Bro, read what you wrote. You need to break up with this woman before she uproots her life and spends a shit load of money and time trying to emigrate with you.

&gt;More importantly I don't know what's the best for her. 

You don't get to decide what is best for her. That's her call. You can only do what is best for *you*."
713,"&gt;am I stupid for thinking that this could work 

Honestly? Yes, a bit. To be blunt: he wants to have a fun sexual relationship with you. He doesn’t want to marry you or have kids or build a life. You’re the young hot girl he gets to fuck now that he’s divorced (assuming he actually is divorced). Have some respect for yourself. Date someone closer to your age who is actually interested in having a real relationship. Don’t date people who are old enough to be your parent."
