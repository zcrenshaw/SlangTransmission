0,"You can't carpool with someone who wants to go in the other direction. Even if you enjoy having the company.  

Right call."
1,If you want her to go and she wants to go just ask her. You are both adults and can make your own decision if it feels right then do it!
2,"You are well within your rights to be over this. She needs to be realistic at this point. An ultimatum is fair here, but phrasing is going to be key.

Don't use ""you"" statements or place blame on her. Use ""I"" statements.

""I need to do this for my career. I need to take this opportunity. I need to focus on my future in my industry""

Place the ball in her court. Go to DC. If she decides not to come and keep pursuing, it will have been her decision.

You've been more than fair and more than patient. My guess is this has run it's course 

Time to focus on you"
3,"It wasn't a joke. You know it wasn't.

She's an unstable bigot.  Do you have some sort of mediation service through your University? 

That's all I can suggest. 

Also, keep her away from C. He doesn't deserve to be subjected to her hatefulness."
4,"&gt; Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip. 

I love this, lol! I'm glad I caught the update post, and am so happy that you went through with the trip! Wishing you oodles of happiness and success in the future, OP. ♥"

6,"Do the plan by the lake. Sounds perfect. If either of your parents express any qualms about it, tell them to talk to your sister about it as she's already acting like a bridezilla.

Do it sooner rather than later. "
7,"Sorry to sound harsh, but your partner needs to grow a spine. Asking your parents to call your baby by their actual name is a very small but very necessary boundary to enforce. No wonder they’re pulling disrespectful stuff like this; he’s probably been letting them get away with it for years."
8,"If you're scared of his behavior when he gets emotional, nothing speaks against a breakup over text/letter. You do not have to subject yourself to this kind of stuff.

 Although i would tell him you're breaking up and not to contact you again via letter/text so he doesn't sit in the dark thinking you were in a car accident and makes your other friends/family worried (or worse, putting them on the spot to tell him you left him)., "
9,"Honestly, when I got to the point in your post where you talk about your feelings towards her kids, that was all I needed to know. Her children are likely the most important part of her life and if you can't love them and treat them the way they deserve, then you shouldn't be a part of her life. I'm positive that if she knew how you feel about her kids she would end things.

You're 24 and not ready to fully commit to a family, there's nothing wrong with that. But you need to let her know how you feel so she can move on and find a relationship that has a future."
10,"Your wife needs a life of her own and probably therapy. A lot of women who’s whole identity is being a mom struggle when their kids hit 8th grade or so. I watched it happen to my mom, she was angry and bitter that we didn’t “need” her anymore. 

Stand strong. You are not wrong. "
11,"""*My first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) ""*

From Belfast! I have texted many unworthy Irishmen after drinking our delicious Irish beers - I feel you!"
12,He needs to be in therapy and actively working on his anger issues YESTERDAY.
13,"I don't think you need to approach it as ""your dream is DEAD and will never come true, just give it up already"". Instead I think you need to approach it as asking her for some of the support you've been giving her for years. You have an opportunity, you have supported her through a bunch of her opportunities... now it's her turn to support you in yours. You don't need to kill her dream in order to ask for support. If she is unwilling to support you after years and years of you uprooting your life in order to support her? Then she isn't a collaborator in this relationship, she's just taking and that isn't someone it's worth building a life with. "
14,"&gt;He ended up being gone for two days and stayed the night at their hunting camp. 

HE DITCHED YOU WITH HIS FAMILY FOR **TWO DAYS**!!!! what the fuck, *seriously*

Edit: Holy fuck how did I miss that he did it AGAIN FOR FOUR DAYS WTF WTF"
15,"Plan a fun trip for the holiday just the two of you or plan out a friend's christmas celebration where you live. Don't reach out to them, don't talk about the holidays with them, wait for them to ask. You have to stop letting them set the stage and play the parent power card over her. If they want a relationship with her it means having a relationship with you. End of discussion. Be a united front and start hanging up, leaving when they are disrespectful. They aren't going to come around on their own as long as there are no consequences for their actions.  "
16,You’ve dated this man for over a year and never been to his house? Is this a serious relationship?
17,"Hi, first off I am sorry about your loss. 

Maybe try, ""Nicole, I let you stay in my father's apartment and use items in it, but I didn't expect you to take anything from the apartment when you left. The magnets and basically everything in there is important to me because they were his. I would appreciate it if you could give me a time and date for sometime this week when you could meet me and return the magnets and anything else you packed up with you. To clarify, I mean if you did not bring it into the apartment, it shouldn't have left with you. Thank you."""
18,"They're not refusing anything.  You haven't told them this bothers you, so they might very well believe you're perfectly okay with it.  Find a way to directly and politely tell them what you want them to call her, whether that's through Google Translate or your husband."
19,"Go file a police report, to start.

Take the police report to your landlord and tell them that your roommate's destructive behavior is escalating. They may not be able to help yet, but it starts a paper trail.

If the ornaments were expensive, tell your roommate to pay for their replacement value. If she won't, sue her in small claims."
20,"Are you quite sure this isn’t a pimp trying to abduct you and sell you into the sex slave trade? I’m totally serious. Awhile ago there was a post about a young lady whose new boyfriend spent tons on her in cash and gifts, but she could tell that something wasn’t quite right. When she learned in one of the comments that this was a common tactic of pimps, and that she should never let him take her out of the country, especially to Colombia (I think it was Colombia) because the area has a high rate of abductions, she was like “OMG he was going to take me on vacation there next month!”

Edit: Apparently it was Costa Rica, not Colombia"
21,Get a lock for your door. 
22,"While many people said that you are not socially aware (and they are not completely wrong), you are conscious enough about your surroundings that you not only went and asked for advice but also followed it. That is pretty good and better than a lot of other people can do. Give yourself a pat on the shoulder for that!

I wish you all the best in your social endeavors :)

It's an uphill climb for the best of us."
23,"What?  This is so weird.  Of course invite her.

I think the concern is that ""what if you realize you don't like her 3 days into the vacation"" or something, but seeing someone for basically a quarter of a year is past that period where you're gonna be like ""nah, I definitely don't like you enough to be stuck with you on an island for a week"".  "
24,"Your mom is wrong- that' not a friendship you want to preserve. Someone who ends a friendship because you won't come see them over a family holiday and then shows you the horrible things people have said about you behind your back? no. That's a toxic person.   
That being said- there are important reasons to cultivate friendships outside your relationship- it just seems like you've been trying with the wrong people. You're 34- you should be able to find friends who aren't just into going out and getting wasted and meeting dudes. "
25,"Everyone else is giving good advice on what actions to take. So I wanted to comment on ornament repair! Not that I'm any kind of expert, but:

1) make sure you have pictures! if not of the intact ornament, then of the largest pieces. That will help you replace them with similar ornaments if you'd like to.

2) For ball ornaments, you can get a clear glass ball ornament of the same size to use as a scaffold, and glue the shards on the glass ball as closely/correctly as you can. It won't be exactly the same as new, but I think it would still look great. You could even use a gold ornament instead of clear, so gold cracks would be visible - kind of like kintsugi, the Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics through gold. Celebrating everything the object has been through.

3) Just sort and save the pieces if you aren't sure what to do with them yet! For ornaments that absolutely cannot be repaired, some people put them in openable clear bulbs, others make mosaics out of the pieces, others even put them in Ziploc bags and hang them on the tree (I read about that once). You can also consult a ceramic/glass repair specialist to see what can be done.

Sorry to hear that your roommate would do something so cruel and hurtful. I hope you can think of how your grandparents, aunt, and mom would respond to this situation as well - I imagine they would comfort you and tell you not to worry because they are always with you. :)

EDIT: If you haven't cleaned up the mess fully yet - Pull a piece of pantyhose over the vacuum nozzle, and vacuum. You'll be able to capture all the fine pieces of broken glass that way without sucking them into the vacuum, so you can save small fragments if you would like to use them for repair. This method works for finding small lost items like earrings so I think it would be great for this, but broken glass may cut/snag the pantyhose by the end of the whole process!"
26,Your boyfriend comes off like an asshole here and I would look into finding a hotel room to stay in if you could afford it. Get away from his mom if she isn't able to respect you.
27,"&gt;one friend worried about what she may think my expectations are of her (i.e. sex... but we're already doing those things... and we're 30...). 

LOL

Dude it's totally fine. Ask her to go if you want to bring her. I don't think it's too soon at all."
28,"&gt; He makes me feel like a terrible person for turning down sex. To the point where he gives me the cold shoulder, and then screams at me

Is this a normal reaction from him? Because if so, I'm sorry to tell you that you're in an abusive relationship."
29,"I'd move out out first, then tell him is over by phone/text and block him. Rent, because then you're not stuck in one place if crazy decides to follow. This guy apparently has issues, he might not give up at the first hurdle. 

Get out of there, OP. You can always buy that house later. Perhaps contact a local domestic violence shelter, they can help you figure out if your plan needs more."
30,"Tell your girlfriend to stop because it risks your job. If she cannot respect that, then she does not respect you. But you don't have to tell her that.

Have you said that? Exactly like that?"
31,"If Natalie is your best friend since early childhood, I'd expect her to carry more burden in this. Firstly, you're her best friend, she should be helping you at this time when you're dealing with devastating emotions. Secondly, Nicole is HER mother, she is in a much better place to say ""MUM I cannot BELIEVE this, give me that tinfoil back IMMEDIATELY, what is wrong with you?"" ... whereas it might be harder for you to say that.

There's a huge difference between ""please feel free to take things out of this house"" and ""use some washing liquid while you're here"". Nicole knew exactly what she was doing. If she thought she had heard she could have taken a box away with her, any normal person would have said ""are you sure you don't mind if I take these things?"". What a horrid woman. Especially to take advantage of you when you're going through something. Ugh.

Also I have never heard anything as maddening as telling a recently bereaved person to ""relax"". I want to punt her into a river. I am so enraged by that.

PS I'm so sorry about your Dad xx"
32,"You invited her; she RSVP'd ""no"". Your obligation to make plans with her is met. YOU are not choosing between them, SHE is choosing not to see you. And since she has a history of that, you're under no impetus to make extra effort."
33,"Anecdotal story! I was dating my now-husband for all of 3 months before I splurged on a 10-day trip for us to Japan. He'd never been, always wanted to go... we were both in our 30s and I had more than enough money to afford it. I made it his Valentine's Day present. 

(Word to the wise: I *did* purchase travel insurance and refundable tickets/accommodations. Just in case.)"
34,"It sounds like your boyfriend used you to babysit his mom so he could say ""he introduced you""...The picture you've painted shows your boyfriend as lacking all empathy and most importantly, respect!"
35,Therapists are like shoes: some don't fit and some are just useless. Ditch her by email or phone. Better without a therapist than with a bad therapist.
36,That was beautiful how do I subscribe to you
37,"We are here on Earth only one time. Without hesitation, what type of wedding do you want? You see, that first thought you just had right there....do that. Congratulations, take lots of pictures on your big day!"
38,"I was in academia a long time, then jumped ship.  Unfortunately, as you are realizing, there are *no positions.*  And if there are open ones, the people who get hired either have been in that holding pattern for far longer with a giant CV (3 years of post doc work is actually very short nowadays, most people I know average 7 to 8 years) or have connections with influential faculty or have large grants they can woo the university with.

That said, I had peers that realized this and adjusted their expectations, or ones that are still in that holding pattern with spouses that support them chasing this ""dream"".  Sadly, most faculty and many peers will fuel this unrealistic dream and my guess is she'll get alot of shit for bailing if she leaves academia.  I feel for her alot, but there comes a time when you need to practically look at life.  Not all dreams are attainable, and you can't expect your SO to constantly your dreams while neglecting theirs.   


 Be honest with her.  She can't expect you to sacrifice your career as well.  Does she have any peers that have left academia?  It might be helpful if she has some ""come to jesus"" conversations with friends/colleagues who have left.  If she's only surrounded by people who are making the same choices it's very easy to justify this lifestyle."
39,"Maybe it's just me, but I'd be pretty okay getting yelled at for taking a 16 year old to get an abortion if her parents would have forced her to see the child to term. It won't be a fond memory for her, surely, but it's likely it'd be fonder than having a kid at that age."
40,"Girl, I ran into the ex fiance 20+ YEARS after we broke up. Each of us were married 20 yrs. He had kids, ffs. He still 'had nothing kind to say to an adultress'. ' (Aka I found someone to date after a full six months of refusing to see him or say anything to him.). Crazy people be crazy. "
41,Don't ruin your mental health for a volunteer position. Maybe there are other mental health hotlines in your vicinity you can volunteer for?
42,[deleted]
43,What he’s threatening to do to you is illegal. Report this to the police. 
44,"You have a fundamental incompatibility.

To me it sounds like she assumed that her not wanting kids was due to other external factors, and when they improved, she realized that in actuality she just doesn't want them.  Sounds like you guys got married very young.  Unfortunately sometimes couples grow apart instead of together.  Sorry OP."
45,"You don't have an in-law problem, you have a fiance problem. He's marrying you, not them, and he should thinking about how to build a life together with you. Not mentioning family gatherings isn't doing that. He should insist that you are invited and respected once there or he should not go. I would postpone the wedding until he shows that he will stand up for you. The way you make him understand the effects on you is:

""Sweetie, when you don't stand up for me, I feel rejected and like I am not part of the family. It bothers me so much that you don't stand up for me that I am rethinking our engagement. I love you very much. How can we resolve this?"""
46,"&gt; But now I feel like crap, feels like I am throwing a future relationship full of potential away, and who knows I may change my mind when I am older so this may even be a non-issue.

There wasn't much potential if you disagree on such a critical issue, and banking on ""I might change my mind later"" is a bad idea.

There are many more women for you to date who will share your feelings about kids. Go date some of them instead."
47,"Tell him you’ve enjoyed the exchange but you are going to need the dock this summer and that he should make other plans for his boat. Give him a firm date.  

You really do not need to give a reason.  If he asks you can say you are going to be using the dock yourself.  If he presses you can claim to be looking into your own boat or that you are taking up photography from the dock or you are involved in a conservation study or a Boy Scout troop is going to use it or you are renting it out to Instagram models or you are setting up an Airbnb and the boat can’t be there. Then if it comes up later, say that deal eventually fell through.  Or even better, actually find some other use for the dock that prevents his boat from going there.  If he wants to redock his boat then you can say you now realize that you prefer not having strangers on your property letting your dog.  

I don’t generally advise lying to people but I don’t really think this is worth trying to resolve with him or explain.  If he’s a hot head it will probably degrade into a fight. If he can’t do a decent job mowing and doesn’t see how other people entering your property is a problem, he is unlikely to really grasp the situation. 

"
48,"Never mind you never being to his place in the year you’ve dated but do you want to be with someone who feels so callous? 

*He then proceeded to tell me it wasn’t his fault I had no where to go and it wasn’t his responsibility to make sure I wasn’t alone on Thanksgiving.*

Yep. Got a winner there. I wouldve dumped on the spot. You’re not being over emotional. You’re dating an asshole. "
49,"As a dental hygienist who took and passed the test, the best time to do it is right out of school while all the information is still fresh. Failing it twice and then letting a whole year go by makes it really unlikely she will ever pass it.  I also think her schooling might have a time limit when valid to take the test and if its not done within that time you have to go through school again. And not sure where you are or if it just wasn't mentioned in your post, but in addition to the written boards she has to pass a clinical board to get her license.
I definitely don't think it's unreasonable for you to be frustrated, I'd be over it all too, especially because you're doing most of the housework."
50,"&gt;	He has had a serious anger problem our entire marriage

Well that’s the problem right there. Not the sex or orgasm.

Your options:

-	Divorce
-	Demand he see therapist/work on anger issues
-	Do nothing and be unhappy "
51,"In the absense of you sharing anything about yourself, people will pull from their own life experiences and apply it to you. So gay people will wonder if you're gay, depressed people will wonder if you're depressed, and your gf who has experience of living with someone who is a child abuser...

&gt; My silence has become a bit of a sticking point as she takes it as me not being interested in her.

There's being quiet, and there's being silent. If she's honestly looking at you and wondering if you're the same as her dad, then honestly, you probably haven't told her anything about yourself. Or at least, not enough base a relationship on."
52,"&gt; How do I explain to him that I simply don't want a child and am taking logical precautions?

Sounds like you have explained it to him, he just doesn't want to listen."
53,Yes this is absolutely a dealbreaker. He violently attacked you and your property. With his kids in the next room. Is their mother still in the picture? I would give her a heads up about this when you break up.
54,"My husband is a brilliant , brilliant man with a mind full of science, maths and technology (and his mistress - CARS!) but he could not debate with you about current affairs, talk about modern music, discuss the Godfather or Schindlers List. I am the opposite - I have general knowledge on lots but none of his specific brilliance. When this comes up in social occasions we just joke about how unless it's under those specific titles he will be a polite listener but when he and our friend who is an engineer get going he won't stop and it is wonderful to see. 

Love her for who she is and not who you wish her to be, if you can't do that break up with her.  

&amp;#x200B;"
55,"You don't have to tell her to stop chasing her dream. You just have to state your wishes and boundaries. Tell her you need stability and to work on building your future, and you're going to move as necessary to advance your career, and direct your funds as necessary for building a savings/retirement account. If she can afford it on her own, she can chase her dream, but you're no longer able to give logistical (moving to accommodate her short-term gigs) or financial assistance.

I think saying that you are moving and you'd love for her to join you is a perfectly acceptable thing to say. You are way ""behind"" on career advancement and probably retirement savings, too, so you need to focus on those things, and you'd love for her to join you, but those things you're moving for are so important that you need to go with or without her."
56,"I know you make more but unless you make 10X more than her you are paying too much for rent. And if she is buying something stupid like a $100 protein shake mix, she is paying too little. If she makes $8/hr and you make $32 the proportion is you would pay 4x more for it to be ""equal"".. I'd do something like that, but it's way off right now."
57,"    ""and no one seems to be hearing me when I tell them I’m just a fucking garbage truck mechanic.""  
No advice here, just wanted to let you know I laughed out loud at this line. You are a very compelling writer."
58,"I'd see if I could get out of the lease and dump both of them. If she was your best friend, she wouldn't have fucked your ex. And if he was a good boyfriend, he wouldn't have fucked your best friend. Once a cheater, always a cheater. Don't waste your time with either of them."
59,"OP, he has ALWAYS been utterly useless. From the beginning! You will *never* change him. You just didn't see it because you were a teenager when you got together (whilst he was a 28 year old who took full advantage of your lack of experience). The best you can do is kick him to the curb."
60,"I agree with others about the lake idea sounding beautiful and a great idea. 

That said, this happened *yesterday*. You don't have to get married tomorrow. You are rightfully furious. Your sister JUST blew up at you. Take a breath. Give it a few days (or weeks) to decide with Fiance (and Mom if you choose) what you really, really want to do. What feels right to you two? Not easiest, get-it-over-with, quickest...what feels RIGHT? 

No one should get married angry. 😁 At anyone. No one should have a sweet wedding by the lake or a 50-person party out of obligation. Take some time to say, 'what is important to us? what compromises would I make and not be resentful about later (if any)? who do we truly want as our witnesses...and would we regret leaving anyone out years from now?'

IDC if you want it at the Four Seasons or at Pizza Hut...underwater or naked. But the day IS important (not more than the marriage!), and you should get your and your fiance's special day. And congratulations!"
61,Met when she was 19. Proposed when she was 20. Don't worry you'll have a shot at his next wedding.
62,"Stay strong, if they get into your house, they will never leave.

"
63,"You don’t have to make a big deal out of it, next time you host a party when you invite people state that it is adult only. State this to everyone, not just the parents you mentioned. If the parents push back and ask why then there are several reasons you can give: 1. There will be alcohol, 2. Your home is not child friendly, 3. People will be swearing/ talking about adult things."
64,"As someone married to a very quiet person, it can be fucking EXHAUSTING sometimes because even when we have something up where we NEED to communicate, I have to do all the heavy lifting of helping him sort out what it is he actually thinks and wants to express.  I don't know if that's the case with you, but damn sometimes I would just like for him to TELL me what he's thinking.  Or for him to show interest in me and my life, my experiences, my knowledge, or my interests.  I am a fan of comfortable silence but sometimes it makes me feel really worn down to be the one to initiate most of the communication."
65, Because he wants you to feel bad for being upset at him. 
66,[deleted]
67,"There's a huge difference between someone saying 

""you ruined my pregnancy"" (accusing tone)

and 

""I've been finding it hard to enjoy pregnancy because I saw how hard your loss was for you and I'm anxious about it"" (sharing uncomfortable, but honest feelings)

Which was it?"
68,"Um, this is not a man who cares about your feelings. He knows these names hurt your feelings, and he does it anyway—he’s not an idiot who doesn’t realize what he’s doing, he’s just mean. 

This goes beyond name-calling. Screaming and shaking the steering wheel while driving would *terrify* me. Does he even acknowledge he has a serious anger issue? I’d bet he just blames you.

He’s emotionally abusive. Don’t stay with him. "
69,"If this is University housing, definitely file a complaint.  They may be able to move her.  If it's not, then there's likely nothing the landlord would be willing to do.

That said, the rest of you need to keep standing up for C at every opportunity.  Even if Z's jokes are only ""mildly offensive"" or maybe ""questionable but not obviously racist,"" call her out on it EVERY DAMN TIME.  If C calls her out, she'll just be called ""sensitive"" or that she ""can't take a joke.""  If the rest of you call her out as well, then Z can't make those claims against you.  If you don't have any formal recourse against her, then the only thing you can do is to call out her racism/xenophobia/anti-immigrant/whatever BS every single time she makes even a slightly offensive comment.  Don't let C feel alone in all of this--if it's making you uncomfortable, it's definitely making her uncomfortable too.  Knowing that you all have her back can make a world of difference to C."
70,"&gt; ou are way ""behind"" on career advancement and probably retirement savings, too

I've been fortunate, and this DC job is my big break. It's management with staff and an office and everything I've worked for. We could close out lines of credit, pay off credit cards and even be in a position to buy a house (probably a commute out of the city). I make a great living and it's such a pain in the ass - I have zero retirement savings and have never owned a car. I'm tired of renting cars. Even just a 2nd hand family sedan would be such a transformative moment for us. "
71,"Please do not have sex with a woman who is sabotaging her birth control 

And then break up with her for sabotaging her own birth control "
72,And that’s biggest issue I see recur in many of these posts. Words not matching actions. I love and want to be with you but I’m talking to someone else trying to get something started. It’s complete bullshit. And they always get nasty when you don’t sit there and eat the bullshit they try to serve.
73,"Solid advice here. Move out stealthily, but send a final text or leave a note somewhere you know he'll find it, letting him know you're safe and you've left, you aren't coming back and don't wish to be contacted. 

Otherwise it's a fairly human reaction for him to go to a lot of lengths to contact everyone to try to find you to find out what happened and if you're coming back. "
74,"Do you know how expensive Rolexes are? Someone giving you a gift worth hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars 4.5 months into a relationship is way too much way too quickly, especially when there's no other signs he's into you. 

Honestly, this guy doesn't sound like he knows what he wants and he sounds like bad news IMO. I wouldn't accept the gift at this point."
75,"This didn't just start with the pregnancy, did it? His inability to communicate properly, I mean.

And the screaming. And the childish cold shoulder bullshit."
76,"Congratulations!!!... Really I mean it. Your fiance showed you that he is a creep before you were legally married.  If it was just the one off maybe this would be worth a conversation but he did it twice, the second time purposefully trying to deceive you. Do you want to get married to a guy who was jerking off to photos of your sister? I would think the answer is no. "
77,"It’s like she has a warped view of everything that’s gone on to make her 100% faultless. When the incident happened with her confronting the friends parents wanting to be let in, daughter ended up ignoring her mom for a week. I begged my wife to apologize, because daughter was rightfully humiliated, but my wife thought SHE deserved an apology from daughter because daughter didn’t come to the door and didn’t answer her calls and the parents didn’t let her in their house. She said daughter humiliated her and so she deserves the apology."
78,"Your wife needs a job. Pronto. She needs something to focus her time and attention on that is not the household or the kids. She feels out of control and more so as time passes. If her skill set isn't sufficient for a mentally engaging job, what about volunteering? Can you subtly start bringing up things along these lines? Maybe take her to some events, craft fairs, museums, animal shelters, etc. and see what she takes to?

Apart from your wife being a super uncool mom, that episode where she showed up at your daughter's friend's house and demanded to be let in was horrifying to read. I'd be mortified. And you need to continue telling her that you will NOT be part of a united front on these issues so long as you believe her behavior is toxic to your daughter's social development and inappropriate toward other adults.

Let her get mad at you. From what you've written, you're not in the wrong. She's burning her own bridges with your kids. They need to know you're still a voice of sanity at home. What happens when they really need a parent to step in for help but don't want to go to her because they think she's too overbearing and embarrassing? No, no -- you've gotta hold the line."
79,"This is something I’ve been mulling around in my head. A few local friends have invited us to their families’ celebrations so that may be a way to avoid us feeling lonely/left out on the day. 

I’m sort of looking forward to us establishing our own traditions. I think it would be fun to build upon this Christmas and eventually share those traditions with our kids. 

It looks like we may have to provide the loving family dynamic in the future, with our kids...rather than searching for it in others. "
80,Your wife has major insecurity issues. Coffee with a coworker shouldn't cause a meltdown. Is she like this way with any other interactions you have with females? Her behavior is not normal. 
81,"Awesome job OP. I love your idea for the book, I'm sure it must have meant a lot to her and her family. Best of luck planning the wedding and living your lives together!"
82,"First of all, you have every right to be upset and angry with these people. Second, you're young. When I was your age I was also afraid to stand up for myself out of fear that I would ""lose friends"".  I guarantee that if you don't say anything and this continues to hurt, you will just feel bitter and angry and voiceless with these people. Tell your friends that what they did is fucked up and ask for an apology. If they balk at this, then they are not good friends. 

I had friends that did similar fucked up shit to me when I was your age and they wouldn't own up to it. We had a falling out over it. Years later, we're friends again and I've forgiven them, because we all grew up. Maybe that will happen with your current friends. But don't lie down and take this. It's wrong. "

""Hi Honey, you're on speaker in the car. I've got [blah], [blah], and [blah] with me here,"" Is common protocol when you are on speaker phone and the person on the other end expects privacy.

This is entirely on him, and fuck him for putting that embarrassment on you. He caused all of this."

88,"Go to your RA. This is one of those circumstances where the RA or the hall manager will more than likely try to work with you.

Being drunk is not a good enough excuse for cheating in my opinion, but you are the one who has to decide this for yourself. **It is okay to break up with someone who cheated on you.** It is also okay to try to work past it, I want to be clear, but you two are so young that this may just be the first step in the two of you growing away from each other. Do you have any friends or classmates that you could stay with? I'd definitely talk to your RA asap though."

Instead, he launches into a long-winded rant via text after only a couple of dates. How does he expect you to reply to that? He's either kind of dumb (best case) or he's trying to make you feel insecure because he's manipulative (worst case)."

I bet this was his plan all along. Who the fuck decides to go on a several-days-long hunting trip on the spur of the moment and is gone within 15 minutes of someone proposing the plan?! Just getting everything packed up and organized takes half a day for my family. Naw. This was almost certainly a set up.

98,"Holy cow. What? I think this broke my brain. 

First off, if you Google ""buttered cabbage"", none of the first page is in Polish, and the last result on the first page is from the BBC (I'm in the US, so BBC recipes are not normally on the first page), so...your roommate is not only a bigot but an idiot. 

I would NOT be able to NOT get an explanation as to why the stuffing was in the washing machine. I would not be able to let go why someone not participating (but invited to) a dinner put anything in the freaking *washing machine*. That's either mental illness or pure malice, right? But she doesn't get to pretend it wasn't her, especially with her behavior after that with the cabbage and her storming out. She could have thought it funny to put some laundry detergent in that stuffing. 

If you can't move out/neither can she, can you have a House Meeting to end all house meetings? Empty threats of deportation, messing with food (ooh! I burn with rage for you guys), lying, shouting, **sharing bigoted views**, etc. will NOT be tolerated. I know that in some circumstances, if a roommate is doing some Pretty Bad Shit, a landlord will consider evicting the person causing the problems. This may be worth a conversation with landlord. 

I would also consider cameras if it's legal in the UK. Even if she has to agree/be informed. (Hey, SHE didn't put the stuffing in the washer! Shouldn't she want to catch the Grinch who is messing with your dinners? ;-) ) I'd be concerned about my food being further messed with, my clothes, my valuables. I hope you all either have locks/can put locks on your bedrooms. 

Most importantly, I'd like to say how freaking cool and gracious and kind it was for you to make a holiday dinner for C for something none of you even celebrate. Being homesick sucks. You guys were so amazing to do this for C. How very, very SWEET. I can't even with how nice that was. Suffice it to say, however, your dinner parties are going to have to happen elsewhere from now on. I am deeply sorry that Z is the absolute worst. Please keep being great people. Now I want some freaking cabbage. "
99,"It sounds like there are two separate issues: 

1) There's having your feelings hurt by the things that Dylan told you about how much your BF clearly cared for his ex.

2) There's your obvious dissatisfaction with how little affection your boyfriend shows you, how he takes you for granted, and how he mooches off of you financially. 

Recognize that it's okay to be hurt by this and it's okay to be unhappy with your relationship. It's time to first be honest with yourself: Are you happy with this relationship? Even before you found out about your BF's ex, were you happy with how he treated you? If you weren't then that's the real problem.  Secondly, it's time to have a come-to-jesus conversation with your boyfriend, find out if he's willing to step up, start showing affection, and pay half for all dates. 

Figure out what you want, and make it clear that your BF either needs to provide that or you're going to leave and find someone who will. "
100,"Ok so here’s the thing. Shutting someone down hard online is often the thing that triggers intense harassment. It can be anything from being called “conceited” to death threats. If she likes playing she might not want to open herself up to that so she gives them a softer no. You’ve checked up on her....She says she’s taken, she doesn’t flirt back, she doesn’t send sexy photos.... why are you still blaming her for what other men do? Why aren’t they responsible for their own actions? "
101,"&gt; he was so excited to get time to himself that he didn't think of anything else

He is telling you who he is. Are you listening? Your boyfriend is a selfish asshole. Why did he even take you on this trip if he was going to leave you alone with his family the whole time? I'd tell him to get the fuck back here and take me home now. Then I'd end it. "
102,"Look, if you guys are happy, you do you. It's nobody else's business how much time you spend with your husband. I will note one thing, though:

&gt; My friend asked me to come home and visit for Xmas becuase she's going through a hard time and needs support

Not that you should leave your husband alone at Christmastime, but your response, basically that you'd see her later when it was convenient for you and your husband along with the minimizing of her hard time as ""self-inflicted"" rather than something like a death as though that makes it less valid, makes me wonder if there is a pattern of you not being there for her because you always prioritize your husband no matter what. Not that he shouldn't come first because he's your life partner, but your best friend is going to be understandably upset if you don't seem to have any room in your life for her. I don't agree with how she handled it after the fact at all, but I think if you want to keep a friend in your life, you need to carve out time for them and they're reasonably going to feel slighted if all you have for them during a hard time is ""no because my husband can't be there."""

113,"You’re better off temporarily having no therapist than having an abusive, incompetent therapist like this one. Quit her ASAP and report her to whatever entity provides her therapy license. 

This how you drop her:  you leave a voice mail or send an email saying “I no longer require your services”. That’s it. If she hassles you about it, that’s more ammunition to report her to her licensing board, because trying to manipulate you into staying in her “care” is absolutely not ok. "
114,"I don't think he's lying about wanting a marriage and a family with you. I also think he thinks that your superficial relationship is enough, and you don't, so you are incompatible. 

The truth is that this *isn't* temporary. After he graduates law school - I assume he's a 3L - he'll be gunning for Big Law and working 80 hour work weeks as a new associate. Then he'll be gunning for partner.

Some women are happy to be well taken care of without a meaningful relationship. They get meaning from caring for the kids (this guy certainly won't help with that) and their work and are satisfied by impersonal but expensive presents at the appropriate occasions. If that's you, then full speed ahead."

118,I wonder if this is something she has seen her mom/parents do? 
119,"Hey, fellow Worm fan.  

I wish with all my heart I could genuinely say ""of course they love you"" but sadly that isn't always the way it works out.  Not all parents *should* be parents.  That your parents are among that number, I know is a very difficult thing to grapple with.

If you can talk to a professional therapist about this, please do.  There is a lot to unpack, reflect on and then work through.  You can't change them but you can work on healing the hurt and working out how you want to be as a person.  It can also help you learn to build connections and relationships with others.

You should also focus on broadening your interests.  Try hobbies, sports or activities you never thought you'd enjoy.  Learn a language, volunteer or join a D&amp;D game.  You'll probably surprise yourself.  While you do that slowly work on your interactions with people.

Don't forget to keep looking forward.  Set goals and work on a few milestones.  Work out what you need to be independent but don't be too proud to use your parents resources.  It's the damn *least* you deserve.

It won't be easy to stop hurting or wanting their love, respect and acknowledgement.  It's a long journey and you'll screw up several times, backtrack and otherwise get a bit lost.  Eventually, though, you'll find people who appreciate you and you them.  I agree fully that family is who you choose to include, not just people who share DNA.

Good luck, OP."
120,"I love onions and garlic but honestly, twice a day? Every day? That would bother a lot of people. There's probably never a time when your small apartment *doesn't* smell like onions/garlic and if someone dislikes those smells, then yeah, it would be pretty upsetting. 

Could do you batch/freezer cooking? Even if you're cooking most of the ingredients fresh, you could cook up a large batch of onions to use for the rest of the week, roast a dozen cloves of garlic, then air the place out and give her a break.

If it were one or the other, my advice might be ""talk to her about if she wants to maintain separate residences and continue to date"" or ""move in together and have your own kids."" But those two things together are a fundamental incompatibility. You guys need to break up.

As to the thing about ""love"" versus ""soul mate love,"" it's a load of hogwash. Love in a long-term relationship is about feeling bonded to someone, and wanting to make the choice to do the best you can to make them feel happy and safe. That's true of romantic, friendship, and family love. The only difference I have found between romantic and platonic love is the willingness to put the other person's wants higher on the priority list. Like, I'm not moving states to live near my best friend. But I absolutely would do that for my boyfriend. There are no soul mates. There are only people you choose to prioritize and people you don't. And it sounds like you're not willing to prioritize her, the woman who is a single mother and whose children are the center of her world, to the degree that she needs. And that's okay. It's going to suck for both of you, but you both deserve to find partners that complement your dreams and goals, and neither one of you can do that for the other."
124,"The turkey thing, a joke if a weird one.

The cabbage incident, a spiteful act that showed her bigotry.

You can't call someone an illegal immigrant and say you'll try to get them deported and then claim it was a joke. The thing about jokes is, it isnt funny if the person who's the butt of the joke (C in this case) isn't laughing as well.

She sounds ignorant and xenophobic and probably hates the idea of thanksgiving since it's not British. And since the majority involved were white British, then she thought there wouldn't be a problem.

I get that no-one can move out, if only it were that easy. But honestly, I don't see any point in talking to her, she's now deliberately shutting herself away so you can't talk to her. Either she's ashamed or she's embarrassed that no-one else shared her views.

I'd say ostracise her, she's already doing that to you. She doesn't exist to you, the only thing she should say is an apology to C and the rest of you for what she did but other than that - she doesn't exist.

Just go about the house as you always have, leave her to feel awkward and embarrassed, she deserves it. "

138,"“Hey, I noticed you’ve been leaving your patch in the window. The directions are pretty explicit about sunlight exposure. Want to tell me what’s up with that?” 

That’s an open ended question with zero accusation. You’re asking her about two factual things: her storage methods and the directions. She needs to explain her thought process or reason.   In her own apartment, she could have stored her patches anywhere. She’s unwrapping them and putting them in sunlight. You’re going to be putting her on the spot but it won’t matter: there’s nothing she’s going to say that’s going to undo what you saw, that you suspect her of birth control sabotage, or that she knows *you know.*

So before you ask the question you already know the answer to, ask yourself this: is there any answer possible that’s going to ever make you trust her again because this wasn’t an “I put $5 in the gas tank” lie, it’s a “I’ve got you for 18 years” sort of lie. This isn’t the sort of thing that just impacts her and you, it would impact the rest of your life.

Sometimes there is this weird thought process that other people have about someone who has lost a loved on resuming their romantic lives and dating again no matter how long it's been. Patton Oswalt got raked over the coals when he started seeing Meredith Salenger after his wife passed away. There's a gorgeous essay written by a woman named Erica Roman that went in on every person who was judging his decisions and his happiness. You might want to give it a read.

Tell her that to act like a united front, you have to BECOME a united front, and that's what the therapist will help with. Or pitch it like the therapist will help ""translate"" what you each are saying into a way that helps you both understand each other better. Basically, use her wish (to act like a united front) as a pry-bar into therapy. She wants a united front, well you say therapy is how that happens, since you're both trying now and it's not working.

159,"Your husband is way overstepping.

He wants the baby to be full siblings with your baby and for you to carry?! This is not an opportunity to have a second child. This is Martins time to have a baby with his partner. 

You using your egg and martins sperm then carrying is the EXACT same situation as you carrying your own child. You’re going to feel completely attached to this baby. Do you know how hard it’s going to be to let this baby go after carrying nine months?

And it’s out of the question. Tell your husband most sorrugact agencies don’t allow this because generally they don’t. You use one woman’s eggs and another woman’s uterus so the woman who gives birth does not get to claim birthright. If you birth a child that is biologically yours you can screw Martin out of parenthood by fighting for custody. I know you don’t plan to but Martin needs to protect himself because it can happen. Contracts have been overruled in the past when the mom was the genetic mother. A surrogate who is not genetically connected is legal protection and it minimizes personal attachment from the birth mother. I can’t imsgine carrying my biological baby then handing them over.

Don’t even bring this to Martin, it’s betond outrageous. This is not your husbands chance to have a second child. Ultimately that sounds like what he’s going for. Put your foot down on this craziness. Martin gave you a gift and I’m guessing he gave you a lot of privacy during your pregnancy and didn’t try to show up at the birth or play daddy in any way. He deserves that same privacy and the same freedom to be a parent without you or your husbands input. You don’t have to donate but don’t spring this weirdo situation on him "
160,"There's nothing for you to do OP. What he did, the way he treats sex, and his history of blowing up and anger problems...
if he wants to keep his marriage is time for him to act like someone who gives a damn and put in work."
161,"Was she attacking you and blaming you? Or just sharing her feelings? I certainly enjoyed pregnancy less once I knew someone who'd had a stillbirth, but it also saved my son's life, as I took the decrease in his movements seriously. Maybe she felt you were close enough to understand the change in her feelings without seeing it as an attack. 

I'd be inclined to just act normal and see how things shake out."
162,"She is his girlfriend now,you have been relegated to being his sidepiece.I take no pleasure in telling you this."
163,"Definitely wasn't a joke, as you can tell by her attitude and behaviour after the apparent ""mistake"" happened. I would keep as much distance as you can, and only speak to her when it is related to house matters. You know you can't trust her, and now she has let her true personality shine. She is a bigot, and very hateful and spiteful. I would be careful around her.."
164,"We are likely from different cultures, but in my opinion, you should say no. You are under no obligation to help them dig out, and you would actually just be enabling them, not helping. You need to live your own life, and not let them ruin it. Stop talking to them in person or on the phone if they lay in to you like that. You don't have to listen to it. They don't deserve to be in your life if they can't be polite and respectful. They are just using you. It's really time to step back, perhaps completely and long term. "
165,"For what it's worth, i think you did the right thing. That girl's parents might be mad now, but in all likelihood she has a better chance at a more successful life because of this choice."
166,"I think you need to stop going to their house for everything. It's possible to have a relationship with parents where they come and visit you sometimes. It's not healthy to continuously go to THEIR home, on THEIR turf, and listen to THEIR bullshit. It's not about cutting them out of your lives, it's about them respecting both of you."
167,"Ask her for the magnets back and money to replace things she took, then just say nothing. She’s kind of garbage, and there’s no point in engaging with her any further. 

I am so sorry about your father. "
168,After two years this is worrying. You should call the police.
169,"Also known as emotional manipulation.  

Denigrate, overreact, guilt trip, convince you you’re lucky someone wants you and you’ll never do better. "
170,"Your sisters being childish and materialistic. The proposal was supposed to be about her and her now fiancé, nobody else. And she's clearly making it about everybody else. Not to be mean, but is she ever pleased or does she always need to outdo you or at least equal you. You're not in the wrong at all and she needs to grow up and be happy she's engaged. You really can't do anything besides speak to your other family if you have reached out to her, and try explain to them the actual story before she tells everyone you ruined it on purpose "
171,"Yeah, you really have to put your foot down here.   Does she not realize that she's being selfish?  I can imagine it's hard to ""give up"" on this but she doesn't even have to give up...she just has to be willing to sacrifice something for you.  6 years is a long time but she's hobbled you for a long time and at this point you're actively hurting your life.  Be gentle if possible, but TAKE THE JOB AND MOVE."
172,"So he was a 28 year old man who started a relationship with an 18 year old because no woman his age would put up with his crap and now he can't hold down a job, refuses to work, and is blaming you for the lack of income? OP you have put up with this loser for far too long. Quite frankly you should have NEVER had had children with a man like this. 

You leave. You leave this guy and never look back. You and your child deserves better. "
173,"Tell her now before she uproots her life. Tell her that you aren’t certain this is going to work and if she moves, she needs to move for her, not for you. Be prepared to end it. "
174,"That's the worst thing I've ever heard - fuck Christmas - you caught your husband, that's the end of it. It happened, you have to address it now. He clearly isn't even trying to hide it otherwise he'd take her to her place, a motel, anything would be more intelligent. He knows your neighbor is nosey, maybe he thinks he's super smart and won't get caught or he finds this to be exciting, the chance of being caught. Its sick, its fucked up. You and your daughter deserve better and you need to speak up now. Christmas gathering has nothing to do with it. This is about you and your husband."
175,"Sex advice columnist Dan Savage often writes that in situations like this the gay child actually has more power than they think. They're just so used to the dynamic of the parent holding the reins that they can't see it.

It will be extremely hard, but Jen should reach out to her parents to say that them not accepting you is a dealbreaker for her. If they ever want to see her for Thanksgiving or Christmas, if her dad ever wants to ***walk his daughter down the aisle***, if they ever want to meet their future grandchildren, if they ever want to receive a birthday card, and if they ever want her to call and check in as they slip into old age, their homophobic bullshit needs to stop now. As you say, the love you two share is going to be the foundation for a new family. It's up to her parents to take the necessary steps to join that family.

With that in mind, I'd suggest skipping out on Christmas this year, as so many other responses have said. Let them stew with the idea that Jen could have been there, if only they'd gotten over themselves. That due to their actions they may lose a daughter instead of gaining one. They might not turn around by next Christmas, but odds are that they **will** come around. It's obvious they've had some sort of acceptance towards Micky and Seth, and with a few other allies in the family, I bet they can see the light sooner rather than later.

Good luck, and nothing but love and best wishes for you and Jen!"
176,"&gt; I'm sorry to tell you that you're in an abusive relationship.

And the baby ain't gonna make it better.

I don't know about you, but I am side-eyeing the hell out of the age gap."
177,"Oh man, this is going to make your daughter rebel real hard in another year or two "
178,This one is hilarious. Especially as you mentioned you are a widower and she is a divorcee. It’s not like you guys are some starry eyed teens 
179,You are taking logical precautions and he's not respecting you and your wishes. That's not healthy at all. 
180,Uh you were FWB at 16 and 24? Dude run. She's a predator. Do not under any circumstances continue to have sex with her.
181,"You don't get to tell him to not make specific foods. What you and your roommates CAN do is make kitchen rules. Reasonable rules would be not leaving stove unattended while cooking, and rules about proper and timely clean-up of dishes, countertops, stove, putting things away after use, timely and proper disposal of food scraps/garbage that might attract pests, etc.

And if he jokes about his burnt friend again, tell him he's being an asshole. Ask him what's funny about her being scarred and in pain?"
182,"I would actually question if he is really divorced considering you've never been to his house and you could see photos of his 'ex' plastered all over the house.

He certainly doesn't sound like a nice guy let alone a keeper. You should take this whole episode as a chance to cut yourself off from him and find someone better who puts you first."
183,"He put you in a really shitty situation with his ex, and they together tried to push your boundaries with group sex not once but twice. She should never have been allowed to stay to begin with much less the extra two weeks. Your boyfriend is disrespectful and you have a right to be hurt. When he gets home from work tonight I would be gone with all my shit. "
184,"As an Irish person, I am really delighted to hear that you had an amazing time even if the circumstances that brought you here sucked.
Well done you for following through and making the best out of the situation! :)"
185,"A lot of people seem to be taking the stance that your GF needs to do something to ""remedy"" the situation and that is just not the case.  You cant (and shouldn't) force her to learn or care about things she doesn't care about just to save you a little embarrassment in front of people who probably shouldn't be your friends in the first place if they're going to judge.

You two clearly don't share the same pursuits of knowledge, there's nothing wrong with that.  The question you have to ask yourself is if you can get over it.  If not, then you aren't compatible and it's not fair to her to be on the receiving end of your derision simply because she doesn't care/know enough about things you deem important."
186,"Let me know where I can get a hundred dollar Rollex...

We also have friends we play d&amp;d with and online friends we game with/have gone to conventions with. Im quite happy with life, its unfortunate my personal friends couldnt just be happy for me.

You're *not* just spending all your time with your husband; you've got a social life you're actively engaged in.  All of the so-called ""friends"" you've described in your OP are jerks.  You don't need them in your life as it's clear you've outgrown them while they still have childish mindsets.  Carry on with the way you're living your life now, and if you feel the need to expand your social life it looks like you've got some board game and D&amp;D pals to potentially expand that life with. "
188,"I am woman working in a technology releted field. Most of my coworkers are men, most of them are 15-20 years older than me.
I want to pursue a career in my current field and not a week goes by without a meeting over coffe or lunch. Sometimes in the company cantina, sometimes outside. 
Sometimes the bill is split, sometimes they pay, sometimes I. It is purely business. It is less stresfull to meet outside of the meeting rooms and have a more casual conversation abut the state of the company, new projects being launched etc. It never ever occured to me someone could take it for a date. I have my SO, my coworkers are mostly married and we just talk about business and some casual small talk about house-keeping, renovating and their like. 

OP I think your wife is overreacting and you should talk to her. I fear it is caused by some deep insecurities or prevoius trauma. "
189,"Dude, your boyfriend is disgusting. Why he's doing it is irrelevant. The fact that he takes pride in being a huge creep and making you feel like shit is an automatic dump.

190,"Your friend is going through... something. I don’t think it has anything to do with you, however, we don’t know the full context. I’m sorry this happened, but it’s possible they’re going through something and taking it out on you. "
191,"The way he responded is concerning. I mean, does he always ""argue"" like this? Flip his stories back and forth depending on which one he feels gives him the upper hand in the argument? Because that's what he was doing... trying to blame you for the situation (you didn't remember fast enough), then deflecting (actually I just forgot to tell you), then blaming you again when he feels he is taking too much blame.

That's fucked up. And yes it's a fucked up thing to do in the first place. Whether or not you remember a ring does not reflect badly on you whatsoever."
192,"&gt;all of that would cost upwards of 100 thousand.

You are talking about this as if it's no big deal but this is an insane amount of money for someone to ask of you.

&gt;I have the money and I'm not using it for anything in particular right now,

You are using it to save for your future life so that you won't be a burden on your children the way your parents are trying to be a burden on you.   This money should be invested and untouched so that you can take advantage of compounding interest / dividends / growth.   

&gt;it feels like the only time in my life my parents have ever given me attention is when they need something from me.

The change you need to make is to stop wanting attention from your parents.   They are terrible people and you deserve better.   Distance yourself from your family and build out your friend group as a support system."
193,"It was a mistake for you to tell her you love her when y'all had established an NSA arrangement. That probably led yet to let her guard down to the point where she is where she is now.

However, you shouldn't try to make this work with her if you don't want to which it seems like you don't. If you don't, let her down gently and en be the arrangement."
194,"Leave.  He struck you and verbally abused you and he made it into your fault.  Code word??? A real apology would be an apology in front of his sons explaining his behavior is never acceptable and therapy for his unacceptable abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

You sound  like a great kid \*\*hugs\*\*\*"
197," Not to sound paranoid but I second this.  Maybe you should find more out about him.  This is a mixed signal, the question is what is the signal?  Also if he is a normal dude and isn’t sure about you after months... then it is okay to move on.  No gift can replace real affection and love. 
Please be safe and take care of yourself.  "
198,"I don't see anyone else mentioning this, so I will - this is the age that mental illness often emerges. If this behavior is out of character for her, be on the lookout for other strange actions. She might just be a rude racist, but her behavior is pretty extreme, especially for someone who's never behaved like this before. 

If you notice other out of character behaviors, try to get in touch with her family and with the university."

202,"Mm....yes, he is this self centered. He feels like if he doesnt make me have an orgasm then its hecause he isnt good enough, which makes him feel defensive and lash out in anger. we dont talk about my wants or my needs because it either launches him into a diatribe about himself or if its different than what he wants then it starts an argument that ends in #10 on the richter scale style yelling. "
203,"""Don't stop for her"", ""Don't waste 20 minutes"" ""she doesn't actually have to go"" and other similar comments are **not actually jokes**. There's nothing funny about them, unless he's getting his jollies watching you in increasing pain and discomfort, which is hair raising to think about. 

It's him prioritizing his own very minor comforts over your very real physical needs and pretty much involuntary bodily functions. 

One of my ""checklist"" items in finding a long term partner was: I AM THE BOSS AND EXPERT ON MY BODY. I communicated this really early with my current BF. We were headed out to an overnight trip, and I sat him down and said ""If I say I'm hungry, tired, thirsty, don't feel good, or need the ladies' room, the answer I'm expecting is ""Okay, let's fix that."" (ie, let's get food, let's find a bathroom). I promised myself I would never live with a man who invalidated my literal body (""That doesn't hurt!"" ""It's good for you!"" and so on) again. It's hell. 

At best he's clueless and being a bit of a jerk, at worst, this is the beginning of abuse. People who dismiss and invalidate your bodily needs ARE on the road to abuse. It's gross and dehumanizing and terribly selfish and I think this person doesn't deserve a GF or a relationship, quite frankly. "

 It might be awkward for him, or might be something that makes him uncomfortable because it makes him horny. You can't force him to do anything physically he doesn't want to.


Is this a change from the past?


Talk to him about why you like making out and his feelings about it. Talk about other forms of physical intimacy that will make you both comfortable. More cuddling? Quick kisses. Shoulder rubs. Etc. "

It's OK to still love and miss him, but don't go back. Don't remain friends. Don't give him your new address. I have no doubt he loves you and you love him, but assault is inexcusable, end of story.

My husband and I 'eloped' to Vegas, except we brought our parents and my maid of honor and his best man.

225,"I had to do this for a while when a girl at school constantly referred to me by a kind of rude nickname. It all came to a head when I very politely refused her present to me, because it was labeled with someone else's name and i couldn't take their present. She literally started crying and the name was never mentioned again!

edit: For anyone interested the nickname was 'curry'. I was a shy kid who got embaressed easily so if my face got red from blushing or I'd get upset about getting called the nickname she'd start saying stuff like ""oh red hot spicy curry huh!"". Stupid but annoying"
226,"One awkward date is not the end of the world, but there seem to be a few places where you could have handled things better:

&gt; she hinted that I was going overboard at times and needed to tone it down, but it kind of got lost in translation and I continued to compliment her whenever I had the chance.

She asked you to tone it down, and you didn't. You were laying it on too thick and making her uncomfortable, yet you didn't stop even when asked clearly to do so. 

&gt;  I was late by 30 minutes because I got lost along the way and then we couldn't find each other for another 10 minutes, so it already wasn't a good start.

This is pure logistics that didn't have to go poorly. Think of the date like a job interview. What would you do to ensure that you weren't late or lost for a job interview? Go early? Look at the map beforehand? Make detailed/clear plans to meet?

&gt; Right after we left she mentioned that I should go home, but I said I had to go where she was going anyways, so we walked together to a nearby bus-stop

Again, she's telling you very clearly what she wants (you to go home), but you insist on following her. At that point she's probably creeped out and wondering if you're going to stalk her. 

&gt; She said goodbye, sat down on a bench and told me to not wait with her for her train, so I decided to check my phone to make sure I was going the right way and briefly left to check if it was actually the right way. I came back a few seconds later and told her my goodbyes, gave this awkward half hug because she did not stand up and left knowing that was the last time I would see her.

And you do it again. She's done with the date and said goodbye, yet you come back one more time. At this point, she's thinking ""How the fuck do I get rid of this guy?!?!""

All of these actions are telling her that you don't respect her requests/boundaries. That's a pretty serious dealbreaker for most people. "
227,My mother raised me like this (I’m 22F) and I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing in life. I’m basically socially incompetent and I have no knowledge of the real world. Being controlled as a child or extremely sheltered has a very negative affect on your life.

/u/throwaway37474728 why can't he take you with him?

There's no reason for you to stay with his mom after several days of being left alone with a woman you don't know and haven't have a pleasant visit with.

It sounds like your boyfriend's family is very gender segregated in their activities when they are together for the holidays. Knowing this, there's no way he should have put you in the such an awkward position of being left with the women of his family for consecutive days! His cheap ass should have paid for a hotel, so you have your own space to retreat and not be ""on"" for the whole trip with his family.

As an introvert, I'd lose my shit honestly. You've been very strong, OP. Keep your head up."
230,"I think it's really good that you picked up on the missing information.  Has OP actually talked to her husband about the fact that this is bothering her?  What was his response?  Has anyone even mentioned this issue to the in-laws yet?  Currently, the top comment is telling the husband to ""grow a spine"", but we don't even know if OP has vocalized *any* of her concerns to *anybody* yet.  I'm imagining that poor husband being told he needs to grow a spine when moments earlier he had no idea there was even a problem...

&gt; whether that's through Google Translate or your husband.

FYI, and OP most likely knows this, but Google Translate is not a good option for trying to communicate something as delicate as this.

Edit:  To be fair, the ""grow a spine"" advice is no longer the top comment at this time."
231,Call. Do it today. It’s completely anonymous. Have examples ready in your head of things that are illegal. 
232,"FWIW I am 100% with you: assuming your portrayal of your SIL/BIL is even remotely honest, they are horrific leaches who are now getting served their just desserts for a lifetime of financial stupidity and social cruelty.

Your wife (on some level) knows this. But she also knows she loves her sister, no matter how shitty she's been. I'm not excusing her poor judgement, but it does bear considering that she is simply going to have more emotional investment in her sister's situation than you are. Basically, you're seeing this objectively and she isn't. And you will need to have **firm** boundaries and **clear** expectations in place no matter how this shakes out.

You should absolutely set boundaries. I think for starters there is no way in fuck they should stay with you. Put your foot down. Your home is a shared space, and your wife cannot unilaterally decide to allow people to come live in your shared home. That should be off the table 1000% and I'd make it a hill to die on if I was you. Show her all the stories on this sub of people who let mooching (or even non-mooching) relatives/friends crash on the couch ""just for a couple weeks til they get back on their feet"" and then end up in a messy, year+ long situation where they have to formally evict because of state squatter's rights/tenants laws. Be sure your wife understands that in most states (and check your local laws to be sure) after a certain period of time people who live with you are considered legal tenants *even if they don't pay rent,* meaning after (usually) 30 days they don't have to leave unless you legally force them to. Is your wife prepared for this? Ask her. Literally ask her: what if they don't get a job after ""x"" amount of agreed upon days? What if they are horrible houseguests (they will be) and don't do XYZ and leave messes or keep us up all night with tv/shouting/whatever? 

Second, if she decides to give them money **it must be her own money.** Not family money. Not money that comes out of shared savings or retirement or from your household grocery budget: money that your wife earned that she'd otherwise spend on herself. What she does with her spare income is her business, but what she does with your shared household money is absolutely your business, and again, this is a hill worth dying on.

Make it clear that you want no part of this: your money and your living space is off-limits to these people. Her own spare income is hers to do with as she wants, but not family/shared household income. If she gives them an inch they will take a mile and a half, so don't let them get a foot in door (literally). And if they do, make sure it's not on you in any way: if your wife makes the decision to support these idiots, it needs to be 100% on her.

233,"Then just give it to your mom in private and tell her to keep it on a down low? When my great grandma died she left my mom 20 thousand and only her. What your uncle got for her is for her.  Your mom is entitled to get that gift because it was made for her. If your uncles are hurt, its not your mom's fault and they are old enough to be mature about it. "
234,"&gt; my boyfriend has always had trust issues

So you compromise your life rather than hold him accountable for his shit?"
235,"Those are bizarre favors to ask of a casual friend.


It's even more bizarre to keep asking them. In a few months he's asked you to go way out of your way to drive him somewhere three times?!


&gt;I was thinking maybe I should just do him one of these favors and that way, he’ll feel less frustrated with me and I will feel less guilty



Nope! Don't do that. It'll just encourage him. 



You're not being selfish. Continue as you're doing and eventually he'll have to stop right? 


&gt; I wouldn’t want to trouble anyone so I’d just catch an Uber home without saying anything. Or I would ask a good friend a long time in advance and offer to pay for gas/buy them dinner in return.


Yea this is what normal people do, don't start thinking you're selfish, you're fine. 


Maybe if he ever asks for a lesser favor then do it, and make a point of saying how this is the kind of favor you're happy to do."
236,"Honey are you SERIOUS?! What kind of partner refuses to wear a condom and makes their SO go through TWO abortions because he doesn’t like condoms? And why the hell did you decide to have sex with him without protection and risk getting pregnant?!

So many red flags everywhere...please DTMFA and GET OUT this guy is abusive.

Edit: for people asking what DTMFA means, it’s a Dan Savage-ism from his podcast and stands for Dump The Motherf*cker Already"

238,"I don't think it's fair to say they aren't respecting boundaries, because no boundaries have been set. No one has told them yet that they don't like what they're doing."
239,This is sick. How could it ever cross your moms mind to be sexual with her daughters boyfriends? This shit is insane. The good news is your daughter was just born and you can cut your mother out now in order to create a healthy environment for her to grow up in.

243,"Maybe she cheated maybe you're paranoid, if your gut says she fucked some other dude, I'd confront her. Just straight up ask her if something is going on if you feel like she's being dishonest pry a little bit,  if she's not this will most likely hurt your relationship. "
244,"I mean, he’s certainly being honest about how he *thinks* about women, so...there’s that. He’s showing his hand and telling you that he places heavy stock on appearances and considers women to be depreciating assets. 

Do with that information what you will. "
245,"You need to set some boundaries with your mother. Don't share your class schedule with her next term. Have a very firm conversation with her that it's not appropriate for her to be doing the things she's doing.

Do not share your syllabi with her. Put her on an information diet. Also, let her call campus police. After the first few times, they will stop paying attention to her. Make sure your RA and your roommate know not to pick up her calls or give her information about you. Go talk to your campus counseling centre--I think a professional could really help you with setting boundaries and forming good coping mechanisms.

It's probably too late for winter break, but next term check to see if your university offers an Alternative Breaks program so that you could spend spring break doing some kind of service learning. Take summer courses and/or get a job, either on campus doing research related to your degree or an internship. Your career services office can help you with this. Start planning now to do a semester abroad, or even junior year abroad. What you need is *distance*.

For winter break, stay on campus as late as you can and come back as early as possible ""to get a jump on reading"". Over the winter break while you're home--did you have a high school job that you could do some shifts at to get you away from the house?

There are a number of subs on here that might help including r/justnofamily and the rest of the just no subs."
246,"There are two things here. Napping, and things she isn't doing because of napping. 

You can't just say ""I don't like you napping."" Especially if this isn't a change in behavior from when you married her. Would you have the same issues if she took that time to watch TV or read a book or go to the gym?


If she isn't doing a fair share of chores around home, you need to have a talk about that specific issue. Come up with a compromise of who does what around the house. 


If you feel you aren't spending enough time together, you can address that, and come to a compromise related to balancing alone and together time. 


But, you should talk to her about the napping and asking why she's so tired, out of concern, instead of resentment. She can talk to her psychiatrist about her dosage. Go to her general doctor regarding blood tests. "

However, the reality of being a housewife isn't exactly what I expected. I feel like I've lost a degree of my autonomy because I am not doing big things like earning money for myself.

250,"As someone who was proposed to within weeks of a close parent’s death (my momma), *this* is how it can be done without trying to be a detached happy moment in a sea of sadness. I couldn’t think back on the (lack of) proposal without associating it with my mom’s death and a horrible time in my life. You’ve made it so that it was not only a happy moment for you both, but a testimony to both of your relationships with her father and poetically ushers her into a new life without him, but with his blessing and his love.

251,"So if she is making minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, at 40 hours per week she should get $290 per week. Which would make $1160 per month. Her share of the bills is $150 in rent and $200 in food, which is $350 total, which is 30% of her pay. So unless the rent and utilities are also only 30% of YOUR pay then she is not paying enough."
252,"please ignore the posters telling you to just make sure you use your own condom but continue boinking her. break up with her, do NOT have sex with her any further. to be safest, you may want to stop having sex and wait until she gets her period, and break up then. this method will limit her ability to lie and tell you she's pregnant in an effort to make you stay with her.

254,"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK did i just read? How... this is not remotely close to normal. I agree with another commenter who said stop looking for ways to make it better, you can't make it better. You can just leave. Is there any way you can move faster? Even if you rent somewhere? 

Your husband needs to understand this is not remotely normal, or healthy. You guys are going to have to be a real team on this and only talk to each other about what your plans are. You saw what happened when you tried to move and they knew about it? So they lose information privileges. Don't tell them what you are doing. Grey rock the shit out of them (be so boring / give non answers) so they don't know what your plans are and can't intrude. 

You are going to have to go very, very low contact with these guys, or even no contact would be better. They have absolutely no respect for your or your husbands boundaries and have shown you time and time again they don't respect you guys or the way you live your lives, so it's time to cut the cord. Its up to you/your husband how much contact you each have with them but the two of you need to present a united front. 

I honestly don't know how you've put up with this for so long. I would've left already tbh. You need to leave this situation and these people and so does your husband. Just because they are family does not mean they need to be in your lives. "

When someone close to us goes through a hard time and they lean heavily on us, we don't walk away unchanged or unharmed and it's the same with your friend.
This isn't about you anymore, she's probably not trying to make you feel bad, just sharing how she's feeling and probably looking for some reassurance.
Remember how anxiety inducing your pregnancy was and remind her that it'll be worth it until the end and be supportive."
260,Have you met and spent quality time with his friends and family?
261,"&gt;Somehow she won over my parents and they agreed to it. 

Can they actually stop you from getting engaged?  Or just refuse to throw the big party for your engagement?   

&gt;Also, she told me I was not allowed to travel with him even if I get engaged to him. She also got my parents agreeing to this.

Can she actually control your ability to travel?  Can your parents stop you from traveling?  Or is this just you not wanted to upset them?

&gt;But my boyfriend’s parents do not care about that at all. They even offered to pay for our engagement trip to New York.

If the only thing stopping you from getting engaged is culture and your desire to make your parents happy, I think you should go ahead and put your happiness first.  Get engaged in the spring and go on your trip.   If they can actively stop you from getting engaged / traveling then you may need to consider other options."
262,"I would suggest you start seeing your school counselor about this, if you have one. This isn't something you should just have to deal with alone. You may never be able to change your parents, but you need some sort of support network."

They’ve made it very clear I’ll always be a part of the family and I want it to stay that way while still living whatever life I can without my husband. It’s not a fun position to be in but if I can bring them any happiness after losing their son so young, I will gladly oblige."
264,He's literally using her as a babysitter for his mother so he can go do what he wants. This is some of the most outrageous bullshit I've ever read on this sub.
265,"Maybe you should go and see a counsellor by yourself or with your daughter, outline your wife’s behaviour and get strategies for how to deal with and perhaps coax your wife into some kind of mental health treatment. 

There is a tendency on reddit to armchair diagnose narcissism, but your wife’s insistence on blaming everyone else, revising events and total lack of self-awareness may point in that direction. "
266,"Dude, you probably put up with your ex for so long because your dad has set you up to take shit from others.  And he gets what he wants, still.

You're doing well.  You earn more than most would in the army for less hours.  Don't martyr yourself for your mother.  If she wants to see her kids together she can choose you over an abuser."

268,"I had a very similar problem. No one liked my daughter’s name and a few people started using her middle name. I was polite, didn’t matter. I was rude, didn’t matter. I started calling them (and more importantly teaching my daughter to call them) the wrong names. And I mean every one. My grandma was one that refused so I dragged my mom into it too and started telling my baby her name was something ridiculous like Fanny and she got offended and I said something like if you all won’t use her right name she won’t know what to call any of you. Took about 3 days to get everyone on board. Now they love my daughter’s name"
269,"My mother went back to school at 30 years old.  She was an absolute inspiration and she found a wonderful career with several advancements, got her masters part time and basically kicked butt - all starting after most people think there life has been set in stone.  

If you can’t completely dive into the education you desire, think about night school classes or other types of ways to kick start the future you want."
270,"I don’t have much advice that differs from the other commenters, but I felt the need to tell you that you’re doing right by your daughter. 

At 14, finding independence away from parents is important, and your wife is looking to stunt that. Not to mention, she’s being totally inappropriate, lying to you and wanting to join teenage girls sleepover in someone else’s house. Also insulting, thinking that other parents aren’t fulfilling their roles as well as her. Could you possibly get a therapist to come to the house and talk? What if you tackled it as a family issue and not just “you’re being unreasonable”. "
271,"Another (potential) prediction: he will start trying to do favors *for you* or start to give you gifts. This is so that you'll feel obligated to do him favors in return (gifts of obligation—it's a manipulation tactic.)

Don't give an inch. This guy is selfish and either completely clueless or not clueless at all and up to no good. Either way you owe him nothing and shouldn't feel bad about saying no and/or backing away from the relationship."
272,"Yep. You are your own family now, and they are proven that they don't get to be part of that. Sad, I know but I definitely think that a supportive community and friends will do wonders to lift your spirits. The lack of validation and outright hostility is so tough.

273,"Yeah . . . I think you're the unwilling side chick. Dude has a family. Maybe he's been at your house so much because she caught on and kicked him out. Or she was out of town.

274,"Piggybacking top comment to say this because it is super important:

Even if this isn't normal for him, the single largest risk factor for the onset of domestic abuse for women is pregnancy. The largest cause of death of pregnant women worldwide according to the UN is domestic violence.

He may never have been abusive until now but pregnancy is often the trigger for abusers to stop hiding and show their true colours. This means they do not care about the safety of you or the child you are carrying and anyone capable of abusing a pregnant woman will not hestitate to abuse the child when it arrives. 

They won't have some epiphany when kiddo arrives and 'change' back to that nice guy because the nice guy was the act. The abuse is here to stay. It only gets worse the longer you stay."
275,"ummmm.....i think it's pretty clear your suspicions were warranted. it's one thing to have a crush. your wife doesn't just have a crush. she is *actively pursuing this guy.* it's pretty clear that she is ready to go the second this guy jumps on board (i know her message says ""take a strong friendship home,"" but she's just covering her bases for if/when he rejects her). 

you definitely need to confront her. because yeah, lines are being crossed. "
276,"This would have ended in a divorce for me. The lock would have been changed after the first time she showed up and your spouse would have made a choice who they were married to. End of story. However, I do have some strategies to assist. Eat when you are not there. Empty the shelves and tell them that they can't come over with out food. If it's going to be their way, make it their way. I used to work in a super controlled environment and every time I'd start working on something some older person would come along and start pointing out how I was doing it all wrong. I came up with screwdriver theory. I used to carry an extra one in my bag and as soon as they came by I would eventually withdraw enough to get them to doy work for me.  My general strategy was to go super slow until they got frustrated and took over. However, I would also stop and game plan on a little tablet. This made them super crazy. It never stopped for 18 months but by the end I literally did nothing but watch them work. Everything from wiring to mopping the floor. If you can't beat them, put them to work for you. "

283,"She doesn’t want to get a job. I’ve been pro-job since our kids were 7-8 since school occupies most of their time and wife would have days free. She thinks a job would detract away from childcare so she isn’t willing yet. Her ideal timeline would be to get a job after our youngest turns 18.

As for hobbies she’s never had any hobbies really, for as long as I’ve known her. Our kids became her biggest project and that’s where she focuses all her energy on. She’ll do all their homework with them to make sure they understand everything. We’ve had fights over this because I believe kids need to have room to make mistakes and learn from them themselves but my wife thinks it’s 100% better to have an adult nearby always."
284,"TBH, while this is correct, it's missing the point. Even if he omitted to explain he was on speaker, how's it ""super embarrassing"" that she wears dentures? It's really unhealthy to treat medical ailments as embarrassments, and it tells OP something about her fiance she needs to know."

When they're both home, **they both do it.** It's not your ""job"" and he ""helps"". What kind of functioning adult has to be **asked** to change a baby?! Parenting is full time, essentially 24/7 - he doesn't get a pass because he's worked that day. Once in a while, take yourself off to a spa, a movie, grab lunch, whatever. Get a few hours out of the house for yourself and leave him with the kids. A) it'll restore your sanity a bit, and b) it'll force him into action, understanding what you do, if nothing else. This is unsustainable for a relationship and is a recipe for major resentment unless he steps up and does his share."

They've already made that decision for you. They are the ones saying they won't accept you. They are the ones trying to ruin your marriage. 

Jen really needs to work on getting out from under her parents thumb. She shouldn't have tolerated the interference from either of her parents and the one on one talks were not acceptable. 

I understand that she is afraid of hurting them, but they are the ones hurting themselves here. They could have made the choice to embrace their daughter and her partner. They made a different choice and are therefore the ones who have to suffer the consequences.

I don’t think it is abnormal you don’t “love” her kids at this point, but it does sound like you resent spending time with them as it takes away from one on one time, and aren’t willing to be involved with them more, which is fine but it does mean this relationship has an expiry date, one that has likely already passed.

You can care a lot about someone, get along with them, and still be incompatible because of very different goals, values, lifestyles, priorities, or even just timing in life. "

Do you have any relatives who are also concerned about her behavior who you think she might listen to? Is her behavior now some sort of overreaction to the way SHE was parented? Is there a way you can leverage some part of her upbringing to relate to her how toxic her behavior is?

I feel like you're at a point where you need to stage an intervention. Not for substance abuse but for codependent parenting.

What are the chances your kids can stay with a friend or a relative for a couple days?

309,"Highjacking the top comment to say this:

Psychoanalytic therapy is *not* based on science. It is largely the fundamental philosophy of Sigmund Freud (the guy who thought babies could become addicted to holding in their poop), who didn't believe in using the scientific method within the field of psychology. The process relies heavily on dream interpretation to try and understand the person's psyche, which is at best as accurate as horoscopes. According to the psychoanalysts themselves, it takes years before the psychoanalyst really understands the problems of the patient.

I personally would suggest you seriously consider visiting a therapist that doesn't use 90 year old pseudoscience for treatment, since your current one doesn't seem to want to do anything else than project ideas to you

Edit: Seems like this point already has been made further down, but I'll let it stand just in case"

You not being comfortable is fair enough and something that your boyfriend should at least take into consideration before making his final decision. Whilst this decision is his and might make the most financial sense, it's good for him to understand how it may affect you.

Why are you giving him gifts if he doesn’t reciprocate? I would cut that out. You should be taking turns paying or splitting costs.

I don’t think you’ve lost your window. You should be able to tell him what his best friend said and that it bothered you and is making you second-guess things. 

But also consider that his “best friend” might have an agenda, too, because why the heck would BF’s so-called friend say something that is so clearly going to cause problems in his relationship? Let’s say everything “friend” says was 100% true, wouldn’t an actual friend be happy for your BF that he has moved on with his life? I think this “friend” is jealous, or maybe he even likes you himself and wants to break you two up. "

I would have cut my losses after he threatened murder / suicide and they gave him access to a gun.  The next best time to cut your losses would be today.   Get out and run as far away as you can."
314,"The mother of your child seems very jealous that you have something meaningful outside of your relationship whereas she seems to have less meaningful encounters.

She also seems really cruel that her solution to your accident was I want to sleep with other people rather than wanting to be patient and help. The patience of your new partner seems much more kind.

How is she taking her anger out on your child? Because that does not sound like something that a good person does. Depending on what she does try and evidence it such as writing the time, date and description of what she does down, in case of custody issues. "
315,"OP, are you seriously thinking about leaving your husband?

A man with serious anger issues who treats you like this is really bad news. Everything you've written sounds like emotional abuse."
316,If I was that girl I would probably be thanking him for the rest of my life
317,"This ends 2 ways. You trust your gut, or you learn to trust your gut. "
318,"He DID do the right thing.

This girl made her choice to have an abortion. It was legally her choice to make. He helped her out of raising a baby she didn't want, and at the end of the day it sounds like OP's parents are never going to see him as changed. What matters is that he did the right thing, he helped two teenagers in need.

My dad always told me and my sister that the quickest way to poverty is to be a teen mom. Thank you, OP, for helping get them out of this. "
319,"Can you imagine if you found out that you had one last gift from a sibling who passed away, and other people just decided that you couldn't have it? 

Give your mom the gift.
"
320,"When you walked in on her smashing the ornaments, what was said? Did you ask wtf she was doing? What did she say and do?

Also, what's the lie she's told your friends about what happened? "
321,"You need to tell her that this is a blanket thing - not just for cops, but for anyone. You do not want her using your name for any sort of leverage, favors, or connections. Full stop. I would not focus on the fact that it won't work (because that could be disputed in her mind) and more on the fact that it makes you uncomfortable. If she's not willing to stop doing something that makes you uncomfortable, that's a respect issue."
322,On a different note I feel like you should apologize to the parents that your wife went to and demanded to be let in. You don’t want those parents urging their daughter to de-friend your daughter since she doesn’t trust your wife 
323,"I don’t think I’ve seen a shitty person lose it faster than when I bust out a convincingly genuine, “Wait, I don’t get it?” It’s kind of incredible. "
324,"Personally, I'd end it, at least for now. You can be grateful for the friendship you had with whoever she used to be, and also be glad that the relationship with present her is over, because it sounds like she kinda sucks now."
325,"I don’t know if it’s just how I’m reading this but he seems to be making a lot of assumptions? The whole thing about being a couch potato and eating lots of chocolate? 

I think that this is a hell of a lot for him to say after two dates - especially regarding future children! Ultimately, you need to be active to the level you are comfortable with and enjoy - he is totally allowed to love walking and cycling everywhere and is absolutely valid in making fitness a big part of his lifestyle. I just worry this guy will not be satisfied unless your activity level matches his completely. You don’t need to be guilt tripped into this, you need to be supported and it seems to me that this could be a breeding ground for a lot of resentment if you feel pressured rather than encouraged, and if he doesn’t perceive you putting in enough effort to match his level.

This wouldn’t sit well with me and I’d be out. It’s up to you but realise that someone is trying to change you to fit their ideals. You deserve better. "
326,"&gt;but its like she turns into a spoiled wife with a powerful husband when I’m not even a powerful husband

This part really got me. OP is hilarious."
327,"Based on your typical conversations, my first thought is that at best, he just isn’t that into you; he doesn’t respect you.

This isn’t going to change. So you should decide whether this is what you want in a relationship."
328,I can't believe he sent you negative messages if you're the 'center of his world'.
329,I'm sometimes amazed how often I see that same question with the same context on this sub.  There isn't some magic way to explain something differently to a person who has demonstrated they don't care about what you think.
330,"&gt; I've paid for our dates since the beginning  

Uh, why?"
331,"That’s a really good idea, thanks. I’ll try it out. She’s definitely been opposed to therapy because she believes therapists will pile blame on her. If I frame it like a therapist will help her verbalize her side better I’m sure she’ll be more open to it."
332,"Is she open to teaching high schoolers? There are lots of prep schools in the DC area, and some will pay quite decent money with benefits for a teacher with a PhD. Maybe it's not her dream, but it's stability and might give her some of the same thrills as her ""dream"" without the insanity-inducing uncertainty you're experiencing. She can always attempt to hop back to higher ed later.

*Editing to add a personal insight: I lucked into a relationship with a prep school teacher, and we currently live in dorms for free. It's awesome, and often people who end up teaching in prep schools are smart, sociable, and fun to drink with. It's all around a good life, including for the partner who doesn't work there. And a PhD will probably help your partner hop right into teaching APs, which have kids who are super invested in whatever subject it is. "
333,"The guy who proposed should run a mile.  

How mean and hurtful and superficial of your sister

You should do nothing other than regret being related to her. "
334,"Just read through your post history and i recommend taking some time being single and possibly going to counseling to have a 3rd party help you make some self-reflections.

From how it seems - you're incredibly insecure, controlling and in need of outside validation. You've probably had several transgressions because you, yourself only posted about a few major fights that were definitely always handled poorly by you, and sometimes both of you. On his side, there were probably more that stacked because you have a very obvious pattern of behavior.

I am not justifying or condoning his behavior, but i am going to guess he was afraid that you'd overreact (ie. You, yourself, admit to stalking) and didn't want to deal with it. His reaction reflects when i began to feel that way about an ex and i was just done with being scared that anything i did could be misconstrued and subjected to unwarranted jealousy and since you think his answer is bs, you should ask yourself why he chose to give you that - rather than be honest about his criticisms/why he's breaking up with you."
335,"This, OP.

You have, in my view, been infinitely patient and even choosing your own positions based on her own joblessness. That is beyond what I even think is reasonable when you are the one with the job that pays the bills.

It’s all very well and dandy to pursue one’s dreams, but one also has to learn to do that in a way that is self-supporting (even if that means working as a retail manager while trying to sort it out) and she is not doing that as she is entirely reliant on you to allow her to do it. 

Go to DC. You have worked hard and if sounds like it will be an incredible opportunity for you, and you earned it, and you earned some financial security going forward too. Best of luck. At this point, the ball is in her court. It very well may the relationship has run its course, but don’t ever think it was because you did not give enough, you gave enough that would break many."
336,"&gt; I was pretty insulted by her audacity but I showed her my ID and showed her an ID my sisters have from a pool club.

Don't ever do that again. You were under absolutely no obligation to show ID to some nosy racist lady at the park. That's private information and you should not disclose it to strangers, especially if it has an address on it. Tell her to stick her opinion where the sun don't shine and to call the cops if she has an issue with anything. "
337,"YES. And then adding biological kids to the mix is an even worse idea for the step-kids. Don't do this to them, OP."
338,"He brought up counseling months ago, surprisingly. 
I literally had that exact same train of thought earlier: you need to show me that you’re supporting me, not them. I get that they’re family, but they aren’t in your life because they chose to be.

Nuptials have been suspended and pushed back for a good while. We both have things to fix and I’m not down to inherit credit problems. "
339,Was gonna comment but this is all you need
340,"""Mom, you have problems with weight. I'm very worried about your mental health and whether or not you have an eating disorder. I know I am healthy and fine, and if you can't see that, you need help right away.""

Repeat as necessary."
341,"I told her it could get me in trouble at work, she promised not to throw my name around to cops anymore. She still apparently thinks I can get her the City Council’s ear or something though."
342,[deleted]
343,"On one hand, your life. Do what makes you happy. 

On the other, you've lost all your friends? Aren't  you the least bit concerned about that or wonder why that is the case? It sounds like you just need friends who aren't interested in partying that much. It's important to have a life outside of your SO and cultivate other relationships. You shouldn't have all your time and emotional needs invested in one single person. That's not healthy. You could look into particular hobbies or meet up to find people who have similar interests. 

These people don't sound like your friends at the end of the day. Surround yourself with people who will bring a positive impact on your life. 

I will admit though, I'm still slightly concerned about you having no friends other than your husband. "
344,Sounds like he is still thinks of you as FWB. 
345,"A lot of people are focusing on how crazy the wife sounds, however this isn't crazy. 

From her perspective, her husband told her he was going to dinner at a place far away with two guys from college. Then you find out not only was he lying about the location, but it wasn't with two guys, it was an attractive, dressed-down female, alone, in a fancy restaurant. He makes up an excuse that the guy was in the bathroom, so you say you waited nearly 15 minutes, and he makes up another bullshit excuse about the guy having a specific disease that makes it so he has to be in the bathroom for long periods of time. 

As OP said, everything about this makes OP seem like a liar from her perspective. I would likely react the same way as the wife if I was in her position. 

All you can do is continue to gather evidence. Has brian ever posted about his IBS on social media? Maybe show her that. That is a start. "
346,"I've seriously never cared about a wedding or proposal in my entire life, but I was tearing up reading this. What a sweet and thoughtful way to overcome this awful event; I hope you two have a wonderful life together! Congratulations!"
347,"That’s fucked up. Probably goes without saying, but definitely let your boyfriend know. 

Sis needs to apologize big time. "
348,"Please don’t stay with someone giving you mixed signals. The man that wants to be with you will not have you doubting the status of your relationship. Give the watch back, tell him you can’t accept something so extravagant from a friend and tell him you need some space. Think about how you want to be treated in a relationship and then you can ask him if he’s willing to give you that. If not, move on. "
349,Huh. Great point of view. Thanks for helping me see that she is the one making the choices. 
350,"“Hey Paul. I wanted to give you a heads-up. I have other plans for my slip this year, so you’re going to have to make other arrangements.  Don’t worry about the lawn any more.”

If he bugs you about why, realest that you’ve made other arrangements et al. "
351,He doesn’t even need an excuse. My dog being let out 3 times would be more than enough of a reasonable excuse. 
352,"Yikes, sounds like he’s getting cold feet and trying to cover himself. I wouldn’t go unless you want to go anyway and could afford to support yourself/leave if it falls apart. 

8 months is really early to move country for someone and be talking about forever, though, so I think it’s understandable he’s having second thoughts. 

That’s not to say it’s doomed- lots of people move ‘too quickly’ and end up happily ever after. But you do need an exit strategy and to have a calm, rationale conversation to agree as a couple what will happen if it doesn’t work out for whatever reason. "
353,"Honestly I'm leaning towards a mental health crisis myself.

Putting food in the dishwasher?  Hiding food in general?  Sudden bouts on anger?   I mean I can see a run of the mill bigot saying he should eat the cabbage....but to pick up a dish and literally pour it all over his meal?  These do not seems like the actions of a mentally sound person.

This is the age some mental health issues come to light.  OP's post doesn't really make it clear if this seems like a fundamental personality shift or not, but given she was a highly recommended tenant I'd ask around first. "
354,"Also, it’s not uncommon for married couples in academia to do long distance relationships for a time. It makes perfect sense for one of you to be stable and saving money by being stable while the other moves if they get a contract somewhere for a few months or a year. One of my best friends did this for 3-4 years with her husband. They now both live and work in the same city, but it took awhile for that to be possible because of their specialities."
355,"He’s 100% married with a family and separate life most likely and that is the least sketchy option possible. OP this is well beyond usual red flags, you literally have NO IDEA who you are with/live with. This is insane. OP you’re 45, put your big girl pants on and kick his ass out. Change your locks and move on. Good luck "
356,"Just be honest, the experiment didn’t work. You’d think these two would realize that they were terrors the last time and say “Hey we’ll get a babysitter” and leave the kids home."
357,"Don’t set yourself on fire to keep others warm. 

I laughed through way too much, but the scalded puppies honestly make me want to cry. 

Don’t set yourself on fire to keep others warm. "
358,"&gt; Our department meeting is coming up in a day and I'm not sure if I should bring this up. I was thinking I'll just email our Senior Manager 

Oh sweet baby jesus please don't do either of those things. Would be a quick way to commit career suicide at this company. You're wayyyy overthinking this. You have done good work, your manager has recognized this and asked you to pick up other people's slack. Whether they face consequences or not has nothing to do with you. Keep your head down, keep up the good work, they'll make you permanent if you continue to prove yourself. "
359,"I find people fall into one of two camps: 1. you didn't mourn long enough 2. you've mourned too long. It's been more than a couple of years that I've been single, so I'm happy to be in a relationship where we both are looking for a more long-term, serious, commitment and have the same goals.My big fear is I don't want to spook her. "
360,"You being intersex is incidental. What's wrong about this is that you didn't tell him about your lack of equipment necessary for childbearing. It's the kids part. It is the most fundamental dealbreaker there is, if he wants them. "
361,"Dylan is an ass, but you should dump any one who doesn't treat you like they value you and your feelings. This isn't a comparison to how he treated his ex, the big red flags here are :

&gt;the **most I've ever gotten from him was a bottled ice coffee that I gave him the money for while he went out**. **I've paid for our dates since the beginning**, and on his birthday and sometimes randomly I'll give him little gifts to say ""hey I love you and I was thinking about you"". Hearing he gave this girl flowers and rings while **I have to beg him to cuddle me sometimes** just let's me know that what D was saying was true.  

&amp;#x200B;

You shouldn't dump him because of what Dylan said, you should dump him because he's actually really crappy to you.  You can do better and deserve more. "
362,"You are THIRTY. No wonder your girlfriend isn't happy. Your parents have NO BUSINESS  in your adult relationship
 They should not know how much laundry she does or does not do. I don't know why your gf would tolerate this. Cut the umbilical cord bro"
363,"I experience this daily and it’s so annoying. I used to be a cashier and people would come up to my register and be like “oMg ArE yOu OlD eNoUgH tO wOrK?” Like no Debbie, I just come here for fun after I get out of middle school. People think I’m 12, I’ll be 22 soon. 


And don’t get me started on the “you’ll enjoy it when you’re fifty thing.” Like maybe I enjoy how i look right now, and I’d enjoy it a million times more if you didn’t treat me like a child just because I look young.


Honestly what I do is just try to ignore them. I have no solution. Someone once told me I should come up with a really snarky joke to say to ppl but I haven’t come up with anything. Sometimes when ppl are really inappropriate or needlessly rude about it I try to act like they’ve embarrassed me and themselves, and that makes some people feel awkward which gives me a tiny bit of satisfaction. But yeah idk what to do, Ive just stopped thinking about and i just know that i enjoy how my face looks no matter what other people say!"
364,"So... he has every right to be resentful. 

&amp;#x200B;

They picked her over him.

&amp;#x200B;

His video games are the only escape from the knowledge his parents don't love him enough to protect him or give him any help since simple homework takes a few hours. Why aren't you trying to protect him from his abuser but are disciplining him like a parent? You're continuing the circle of behaviour your parents started and are being a shitty parent yourself. Video games are a symptom, you should be going after the disease.  "
365,"&gt; we have had some bumps in our relationship

I'm curious what those ""bumps"" were because the way he behaved on this trip was inexcusable. "
366,"100%. If she ever knew how you felt about her children she’d agree that separating is the best. It’s not your fault you don’t love them the way she does and you shouldn’t feel guilty for how you feel. This is a deal breaker. 

Good luck "

369,"I would just stay in the US and not fly back.

Just like him, you can cite cost as the reason. "
370,Why do you care about the family drama? You were a victim of sexual abuse. Why are you so worried about causing a drift? Your parents did you a disservice by accusing you of lying because now it's been 11 years. You should cut your sister and her husband out of your life.

373,"&gt;a make out session


I think kissing, even a passionate kiss, outside of sex is totally reasonable, but a full on make-out session that arouses him might not be reasonable.


I can see why he thought you were initiating during the movie; could you maybe be very vocal before the kissing starts? ""Hon, I'd love to make out a little, but not have sex - are you down for that?"" 


Also, are there other expressions of physical intimacy that don't arouse him that would satisfy you?"
374,"You're creating your own problems by trying to be the ""cool girlfriend""."
375,"Stop deflecting and tell him directly that he's repeatedly asked you. You've told him you don't want to discuss it, and it frankly, isn't his business.  His questioning has become invasive instead of friendly."
376,"Since I haven’t seen anyone else say this yet, OP when you break up with this girl (and you definitely should), you need to change all of your debit/credit numbers, PIN, online banking passwords, email, etc. 

Anything she could use to get access to your finances. Because if she’s willing to use a neighbor’s info to steal things, you better bet your ass she’ll be willing to use an ex-boyfriend too."
377,Why do your parents and girlfriend need to have deep discussions?  What's wrong with talking about TV and books at Thanksgiving?
378,"Yes, you should tell her!! She needs to know who she is marrying. She needs to at least be able to make a decision about it- it's not fair to keep her completely in the dark. "
379,A man who doesn't understand the concept of reasonable requests and healthy distance is dangerous. He's showing abusive signs and you would be wise to take notice. I might be overly cautious but the fact he wants you alone and gets mad when you refuse make me think his intentions aren't good.
380,"PLEASE listen to this!  If they can trick your wife into letting them move in after everything they've done, then there will be almost nothing they can do to get kicked out.  It will be an endless supply of ""oh we'll be back on our feet in 3 months, just need a little help"" and ""you won't believe our luck.  How could we control or have known about (easily predicable and controllable excuse)?!?""  And they are they type that would make you go through the formal eviction process if you wife ever does get a spine.

I normally wouldn't say make ultimatums, especially when there is about to be a child, but you need to stand firm here.  If not, then the relationship is over anyways if they move in.  And even if that wasn't the case, why would you want to be involved with someone who would think so little of you?"
381,"It definitely could be the antidepressants.   Also restaurant jobs can be draining far beyond the number of hours would suggest.  Sadly I have experience with both of these things.  

But I also know how incredibly frustrating it can be to wait for someone to get up!!!  If I were you I’d talk to her about it, approaching it from a place of empathy and problem-solving, not blaming.  See if she’ll talk to her doctor about it.  And in the meantime maybe help come up with some definite plans or projects for your days off together to keep her active and engaged.  Coffee helps.  Good luck!"
382,"Love is a verb, not a state of being.

After 40 years of marriage, couples don't feel the same way they did on their wedding day. Love changes and grows, it doesn't always feel like a Disney movie. Love is making an extra cup of coffee for her while you're making your own. Love is running out at 10pm to Walgreens because she's sick and you just realized you don't have NyQuil in the house. Love is turning to your best friend when you read something funny and wanting to share it with her.

The real question is who do you want to be doing these things for? And who do you trust to do them for you? Being in love is having a partner to go through life with hand in hand, make your decision based on that. Because the rush of a new relationship doesn't last, nor should it. That's not love, that's infatuation. Real love can sometimes feel like it's dying, sometimes feels crummy. That happens if you or they are not remembering to WORK for it. When you decide a love is worth continuing to put work into and your partner puts in as much work as you do, you'll know it's for keeps."
383,"Sounds like your own apartment is a great idea, whatever your BF chooses. He seems threatened and he seems to have a lot of things going on. That's not all on you to deal with.

You can get your place and if he catches up moneywise, you can move into a space together, your apartment can be rented out as well. Why the assumption that he gets a place to rent, but you and him will share your apartment? There seems to be some entitlement and resentment to be seeping in, and it might indeed be that you're in a different lifephase because of money than he is, despite being younger.

Seems like you should keep your finances apart for a while. Especially if he keeps mentioning break ups. You don't have to put your life on hold to keep his going."

387,"I've asked her help a little with cleaning, but she says she does more than I think. I work nights right now and will come home in the morning to filth. Wrappers/empty chip bags on the floor, dirty bowls on living room tables. Not once have I walked in the door and went ""Woah, it looks nice in here!"" She lived with her parents until we moved in together, so she'd probably just go back there."
388,"Make a list of what you each do around the house for a month. My bf was genuinely unaware of how much more cleaning I did than him. He was usually at work when I cleaned and he’s one of those people who seems blind to some messes (he would never notice if they sink wasn’t clean or the apt hasn’t been vacuumed). For one month, we started writing down each time we did a chore. It helped to have something concrete to compare our workloads. There was no “well I FEEL like I contribute equally”, there was a definitive list showing he washed the dishes a few times and took out the trash while I did dishes, vacuumed, dusted, cleaned the bathroom, washed the bedding and towels, wiped down counters, etc. That opened his eyes as to how much I was doing and we now have a chore list for a more even split.

You should focus on moving out on your own and building a stable life for yourself. You don't have to be living with your family to have a great relationship with them.

&gt;

Your GIRLFRIEND is the one refusing to draw and keep firm boundaries with this guy. His behavior keeps continuing and escalating because she let's it.

If I were you, I would be questioning why your girlfriend refuses to tell this guy to shove it. I do not care how great of a friend he was. He is now being manipulative, demanding  and controlling. It is not your place to talk to him. You have a girlfriend problem, not a girlfriend's ""best friend"" problem."

400,"Writing to her isn’t going to do any good because she will deny anything you say and probably DARVO (deny, attack, reverse victim and offender) and make the failure of the mother/daughter relationship your fault. You will find good support at /r/justnomil and /r/raisedbynarcissists, because what you’ve got there is a mother who cares only about herself. You’re just a possession only worth what you can do for her, and your baby is a prop for her to play Grandma of the Year. 

It hurts to have a parent who doesn’t love you but pretends to. It hurts a lot, but once you realize that and can stop seeking that love, you will heal. If you choose to cut her out of your life, that is completely understandable and nothing to feel guilty about, but feeling guilt is totally normal and some therapy might help you deal with the wounds from your childhood.

I just don't have the frame of reference with which to judge.

if a month ago your first response to her second thoughts about leaving were to reaffirm your intentions to leave the country without her, and no intentions of remaining 'faithful', then i would say that's....not love."
407,"To piggyback on my first comment, when he realizes your engagement is most likely over, he is going to try and gaslight you, even with the video. Don't let this happen."
408,"Yes, he is currently sitting on the couch refusing to look at me. I'm scared to say anything because I know he will go off. "
409,"A baby isn't going to make this situation better. You sound like you're in an abusive relationship. I'm not sure what your thoughts are on abortions as that's your choice, but I don't think this is the time or place to bring a child into this world.   

You really should get away from this guy. He seems cruel, and I'm sure this only scratches the surface of how he treats you.  

Please find family or friends who you can trust to confide in to get out. If he'd isolated you from them, reach out anyways and ask for help. "
410,"&gt;In short, he believes they did not protect him from abuse and he still lives with his abuser. 

This is horrific. How is your brother supposed to heal, when your family keeps reopening his wounds every day? Not only did they not protect him from abuse, but they are still subjecting him to abuse right now. He is living in an abusive situation. Of course he has issues, this situation would make anyone have issues. 

Your parents are continuing to neglect/abuse him. Therapy is not enough, without also improving his home life. His health is declining, his mental health is declining, his grades are declining, he is mentioning the idea of suicide (""the only reason he's still alive"")... how many more cries for help does he have to cry before you all take him seriously? 

&gt;I just want the best for him but I don't know what that is. 

Why won't your parents kick out his abuser? Do they realize what damage this is causing their son? He is their minor, dependent child and they are responsible for taking care of him. Have you ever sat them down and spelled it out for them?

Would they financially support him if he moved out? Could he move in with you / could you move out together to a new place?

Also your brother is 16, not 6. He's not a baby. In 2 years he will be 18, and only 4 years younger than you. You will be adults, peers. Why don't you just talk to him and ask him what would best help him? Why don't you try to be his friend, tell him you're worried about him, ask what you can do to help? He probably feels like his abuser and his parents betrayed him, you don't want him to think you would betray him too... you're already acting like a third parent to him, disciplining him like he's a small child having toys taken away, and yet you are doing nothing to make his abusive situation better. He may already resent you like how he resents his parents.... "
411,"yeah, she was only friends with you because you made her look better. sorry. it sucks. she sucks. 

i wouldn't bring it up with her. in fact, i'd just ignore her. certainly act cordial and polite towards her (if only so she can't talk shit about you being ""mean"" to her), but i wouldn't pay her any attention. lose more weight by dumping her as a friend."
412,"Get the fuck out if there dude, don't give her her paper that you wrote she doesn't deserve it, don't send her any money, just dump her ass. She's clearly using you and obviously doesn't respect you as a person, you need somebody who will appreciate you and not demand so much from you. 

If it were me I'd 100% tell her professors about the papers bc I'm petty and it would make me feel good after everything she's done, but up to you really"
413,"It’s not unreasonable but you are both adults. Just tell him the time you want him there and he may show up, he might not. His priorities may be different than what you want and there’s no point trying to force him to do anything."

415,"This is all of academia right now. The trend is insane and doesn't lend to the vast majority of PhD's ever getting a tenure-track position, no matter how many post-docs they have.

&amp;#x200B;

Universities are looking to cut costs by replacing retiring professors with instructors which they can pay an average of roughly $5000CAD per course (but the Arts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower than that - This figure includes business, medicine, and the sciences). That way they can provide experts to teach courses as they become popular and drop them when they aren't (enrollment looks good for departments). They don't have to pay benefits. They don't have to provide sabbaticals or support individual research goals. Less than 2% of PhD's remain in academia (including postdocs) 5 years after completing, and a fraction of a percent ever have the chance at a tenure-track position ANYWHERE. It is now being advised that if you are determined to get a permanent academic job, you should be willing to move anywhere in the world. I had a colleague that would frequently compete with 500+ other people in his specific sub-specialization for every tenure track job he applied for.

&amp;#x200B;

Try telling her some of those things. I've got more truth bombs if you need 'em, feel free to message.

&amp;#x200B;

She's being chewed up and spit out by the system. She is not alone.

&amp;#x200B;

You need stability as a couple, for your career, for your future, and simply for your well-being. It's going to be tough to get over (after investing probably at least a decade into post-secondary education) but it's necessary. She can still keep applying (hopefully nearby wherever you do settle so you can still stay in the same place... perhaps settle somewhere where she can continue instructing if that's something she wants) but there is so much more to life than working yourself exhausted for the hope that maybe, someday, with enough hard work, volunteering, good will, sacrifice in her personal life (because it doesn't stop when you get the tenure track position) to MAYBE actually advance to tenure eventually IF you get the job.

416,"Hey, and thanks. 
Yes, I am hoping that the text where she said ""Hey, relax"" means I am getting them back, no fuss. Even if it hadn't been other things, stupid stuff like boxes of laundry detergent, I feel paranoid about being in the apartment because all I can think is ""what else is missing, what has she taken and gotten away with?"". She's ruined what little energy I had left to deal with all the practical apartment-stuff (dramatic as it sounds). "
417,i think you should listen to your friends. you're going to get replies from people like me (living in western countries by western standards) that just can't get it at all. your friends on the other hand... they know you and your situation well enough to advise you properly.
418,"&gt;Pregnancy is quite often a trigger for abuse to escalate 

Yes, this is so sadly true. The first time my father hit my mother was when she told him she was pregnant with me. The abuse escalated my entire life and only stopped when he lost custody of me when I was 7 because he was raping me. My early life is filled with memories of witnessed and experienced violence and sexual assault.

&gt;Whatever you decide to do, you need to get away from this man 

And I would have gone through none of that if my mom had left him while pregnant when the abuse started. OP, whatever you decide about this pregnancy get the hell away from him. Abuse doesn't stop once started. It only escalates until you leave.

"
419,"I'm a bit older than OP and past the point of trying to make certain family members (mine and his) like me, but I'd have been back at home with my feet up on the couch by the time he returned from his first trip.

420,"I will never forget the sleepover I had at a friend's house when I was a kid.  Her mom was in the room with us the whole night, and I don't think she slept the entire time.  Thirty years later, I still have this image in my head of her seated silhouette peering down at me every time I turned over in my sleeping bag.  It was so creepy.

By the way, she was the school principal.  So this doesn't strike me as a SAHM problem as much as a serious control issue.  
"
421,"Nope. I’ve been there when I had to pick him up once, but never inside. We always spend time at my house. He says his house is too small and cluttered and is embarrassed by it. "
422,"I feel awful for your current girlfriend. She’s a consolation prize to you. That’s messed up and you need to let her go so she can find someone who will considered her as their great love.

As for your Ex, you said:

&gt;and I couldn’t leave to be with her at the time

Well, it’s time to nut up and make it happen. You still love her and it’s pointless continuing to date someone else. Move to your Ex’s home country and give the relationship a try. See if it pans out:

* At best, you get married and have kids with her happily abroad

* At worst, you know you gave it your all and get closure so you *can* move on from this relationship."

The best thing that you can do is ignore this bullshit. Figure out who you are, what your values are and be the best damn version of that you can be. Your success will be your revenge, but by then you will not even care.

I get that they are your parents and it hurts, but they don't get to decide who you are."
425,"Yikes! Your friends sound toxic and your friend-breakup was *a long time coming*...

That said, I think there's more to the story here. To me, it sounds like you and your husband are *co-dependent*..

There's nothing wrong with enjoying your time with your spouse. Being together as best friends and preferring to spend most of your time together.. BUT

* Do you and him have any couple friends? Once you become a couple, it's healthy to seek out other happy couples for friendships instead of keeping separate social circles of single friends.

* Do you and him have any single mutual friends? You know, friends you made together *after* you started dating?

* Does your husband have any pre-existing friendships of his own that continue?

**All in all, the two of you sound very insular.** I'm an introvert, so I can relate to not needing a whole lot of friends to be happy, but isolation can easily set in as you outgrow friends you had at earlier stages of your life! That isn't healthy. You need an outlet of other people instead of just the two of you all the time.

You mentioned you moved 24 hours away and work for the same company. Ok, what about your coworkers? Are any of them good prospects for friends to hang out with outside of work? You can start hosting dinner parties or game nights at your home once a month. Alternatively, what about getting into running (join a running group) or some sort of intramural sport? *Some* socialization with other adults, outside of work is healthy whether you and your husband do it together or socialize separately.

Your mother is right, if something happens to one of you or heaven forbid the relationship goes through a rough patch you will feel very isolated and alone because you failed to nuture any personal relationships outside of your marriage. **Your old friends back home is irrelevant.** Where you live now, nurturing some friendships is important."
426,"I agree!! I think a 15 second kiss or a very quick 2 second kiss are fun but a 5 minute makeout session without any heavy petting just seems awkward. 

OP can you two compromise on shorter but regular kisses?
"
427,"I think you're looking for someone else to blame for unhappiness about your education level. I do think it's weird to favor your older sibling with boarding school &amp; nicer things, and I would resent that too. But I don't think you're giving your own choices enough weight when thinking about all of this. 

With your boyfriend - his family sounds crappy. Their expectation that he marry someone with more education - that's their flaw, not yours. If you really think he won't marry you because of that, then it's time to find someone else.

As far as being able to keep up with intellectual conversations among your siblings, is another 2-3 years of school really going to solve that problem?  I know plenty of well-informed, intelligent people who never went to grad school who will hold their own in a political or philosophical debate. I feel like that's more of a personality thing instead of a level of education thing.

428,"I wonder why she didnt name drop her dad to the cops then 🤔 im a cop, i get so many people try to name drop cop friends and family"
429,"Forum rabbi here. Your boyfriend is an unconscionable bigot. In Judaism we believe that a convert is born with a Jewish soul, and that once someone has converted, they are on the same level as someone who was born as a Jew. To say that your conversion is not enough and that you are not enough because you were born into a non-Jewish family goes against everything I hold dear about the religion. Some people find their Jewish family through falling in love with a Jew first, and if you feel in your heart like you belong as one of us, I welcome you with open arms. If not, it’s for the best that you broke up now. Judaism’s not the easiest identity to carry, and you don’t want it if you can’t love it for its own sake apart from your partner."
430,"I had a similar situation, where I was ""parentified"" (forced to be a parent to my siblings like you were) and it really changes you. You were supposed to be a child at that age, but you couldn't be because you were taking care of people.

So first of all, cut yourself some slack. You don't need to go to grad school right away. Many people don't, and they still are very successful.

Second, look into a different financial situation with these loans. Your parents may or may not be able to help you with paying some of it back, but it sounds like some of your siblings can. Look into this and don't be afraid to ask for help, especially if 70% of your money is going to loans! They don't want that for you, but you have to talk to them about it (which is scary, I know).

Third, I found it takes a long time to build up that self-love, and you need a stable situation without much rejection to do that. It doesn't sound like your current life, with your BF shrinking back from talking about the future and his family being terrible, is going to help you learn to love yourself. You need to seek out the conditions that will help you get to where you need to be. That might be spending more time with certain people or less time, maybe it means saying ""thank you"" instead of ""sorry"" (something I'm trying to change), maybe it means therapy to unlearn bad habits you have about putting yourself down.

Best of luck!"
431,"That really bothered me. It showed me that they don’t argue well, which is a sign of immaturity. My fiancé and I got into a huge fight once before his family’s reunion. The fight didn’t get resolved before the reunion. But I still went, and we tabled the argument until we were alone at home again.  If you can’t still be a couple even when you’re arguing, then you’re probably not made to last. "
432,"If that's a dealbreaker for you, it's a dealbreaker.  You can break up and move on.  You have a cultural difference, and it's on you to decide whether this is something you want to continue pursuing."

436,"My mom went through this with her in-laws, only it was a cutesy nickname of my first name. She finally told them they couldn't see me if they didn't use my real name. (My dad was out of the picture at this point but his parents stayed involved.) 

It's important to set boundaries now, because if they won't honor your wishes with her name, they won't honor your wishes when it comes to other things. (For instance, my grandparents frequently gave me foods I wasn't allowed to have, and, on several occasions, foods they knew I was allergic to, when I was left in their care.)"
437,"I guess if you're refusing to do many of the things that would help - can you talk to your parents? 

What are the ramifications if you just... do what you want? "
438,"I worked in law enforcement for five years in two states and my professional opinion is HELL YES GET THE POLICE INVOLVED.

Step 1 for you is to get your documents in order, including the dates and times he's been calling you. If you can, have your manager write a brief statement of what they saw, especially that you were directed to turn your phone off due to these calls you got at work - that's a huge deal here. If he was only sending you emails or something that's one thing, but the fact that he's repeatedly calling you at your job and caused a disruption of your work is concerning.

Once you have some of this documentation, you can call the police department directly and tell them you'd like to make a report and describe the situation. Make it clear that this is a former intimate partner, which makes your case more significant: domestic violence is taken more seriously by the state. 

Different states have different requirements for what they define as domestic violence and the definition of harassment versus stalking, but what you're describing is not insignificant and absolutely worth being documented at the very least, even if you don't seek criminal charges. You might be able to schedule an appointment to go in to the department to talk to an officer face-to-face, ideally one that isn't going to just blow you off. 

Once a report is filed, you'll have an easier time with the second step, which is to get a protection order from the court. It might seem like a big step, but if he's not moved on after 2 years, I personally don't think he ever will. The court can order that he no longer contact you or your place of work, and possibly that he physically stays away from places that you are known to frequent, including your home, school, place of employment, etc.

If you have any questions for me at all, I'd be happy to answer them. Don't be afraid to protect yourself from this dude - I don't want you to be a statistic."
439,"He’s counting on that. This asshole is using your embarrassment as a weapon to manipulate you.

Your sister might calm down if you said “hey, I was really only planning a wedding to make mom happy, but I’d rather elope than postpone it.  I’m thinking about doing something very small and intimate.  What are your feelings about that?”   I know she’s being a huge jerk, but I don’t think it’s really any skin off your nose to make one minor attempt at being the bigger person.  If that fails, then by all means, she can fuck right off.  "
441,"Thank you for your reply. Just to elaborate a little, when i say self inflicted, she basically punched herself in the face and got upset when it hurt. She, while in a relationship, had an affair with a married man. I have a hard time being sympathetic in a situation where she is not only a cheater but the knowing other woman. If she was going through something less...against my moral compass i would have probably responded less crass. "
442,"To be fair to him, he was up front with you about all of this. 

I think you’re just desperately trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. He’s a passionate person and that leaks into all areas of his life whether he’s actually willing to focus on it long-term or not. Stop listening to his words and pay attention to his actions to see where his priorities are: school. 

Not to mention you are on separate coasts now so it’s not like he’s getting the daily return on being in a relationship that might help curb that behavior. And then he graduated and takes the best job wherever it is regardless of where you are or want to go. 

You got love-bombed and fell for it. It happens. But don’t chase sunk money with someone who can’t provide the type of relationship you want. That’s unhealthy. "

Yes, she needs to get over her insecurities. Insisting you be in the wedding will NOT help with that, it will just cause resentment from the bride... and that is not how you want to start a marriage.

Feel your feelings. Be hurt, be upset. Don't bring it out on him and be nothing but supportive during their wedding. "
447,"I second this, but to add a bit more: Dylan said the ex started as a high school romance. Majority of those are rose-tinted glasses, and it sounds like the whole group had been together in high school except for you.

448,"My husband is a roofer and I am in a cushy government job. I make double what he does. He is perfectly fine with me making more but there is no need for him to be roofing if he is making what he is making.

The issue with my husband is both pride and the perceived inability to do anything else other than construction because he doesn’t know anything else. He has no higher education, has never had a formal job interview and has been roofing since he was 17, he is 36 now. I suspect both things are at play with your husband as well."
449,"This is what I was thinking.   She probably is aware that she has a poor chance of passing at this time.  Her heart really isn't in studying because she knows she won't pass. 

It's time to have a discussion about where her career is headed.   If she still wants to become a dental hygienist, perhaps her school would let her sit in on her old classes again for free.  If not, retaking some of them may even be appropriate.

If she doesn't want to be a dental hygienist anymore, pursuing a different career path could get her income up.  Maybe she hasn't looked because she's embarrassed over her failure to become a dental hygienist.

I would also sit down with her and discuss finances.  If you are sharing expenses it's usually a good thing to use what percentage of your combined income you bring in to determine how much you pay.   For example if you make $50,000 and she makes $25,000 together you make $75,000.  50000/75000 = 2/3 or 67%.  25000/75000 = 1/3 or 33%.  You would pay 2/3 of the rent or other expenses and she would pay 1/3.  This way is fair, but she will still feel the pinch because her income is low rather than just using your income to cover her low earnings. "

452,"There are two things I'd say here:

1) Your BF has a problem that many teenage dudes have, which is that he's repeatedly jamming his foot into his fucking mouth. There are WAY more diplomatic ways to answer the questions you're asking him. ""Man, we had a *lot* of hotties in our class, it's hard to rank them all. I wouldn't even know where to begin. There was Stacy, Kim, Becky, Tanya...hmm...who am I forgetting?* (said, while openly leering/checking you out with a smirk) is a lot better than ""oh don't worry I've given this some thought, let me pull up my spreadsheet. You're #17. That's down one place from last week after I remembered what you look like while you're brushing your teeth."" A lot of this is just your boyfriend being a social klutz.

2) Frankly, it's clear that you're...kind of obsessed with this. You're his girlfriend. He obviously finds you attractive. But you keep finding different ways to get him to 'rank' you, and then 'clarifying' those rankings, and then following up to make *really* sure you know exactly how many other women he thinks are more attractive than you. I'd think about whether there's an answer he could give you at this point that would satisfy you - because my guess is there isn't. Even if he said ""you know, I've thought about it some more, and actually you're an 8,  I forgot about that senior year class photo where you had your hair down and that *sexy* dress you wore the day I asked you out. Unf."" ...You probably wouldn't believe him, or if you believed him you'd ask a follow up question about whether Becky would look hotter in that dress, etc.

So I'd stop bringing it up. Any time you start to feel self-conscious I'd remind yourself that your boyfriend's opinion doesn't necessarily have to change yours; before you knew his ratings/rankings/etc, you were very happy with how you looked, it sounds like. Focus on redirecting your thoughts in that direction. You're happy with yourself. *You* think you're attractive. As important as your boyfriend is, you want validation that comes from within, not from him, right?

If/when *he* brings it up (and he may, because you've kind of made this conversational territory 'fair game' by continuing to talk about it) you should say something like: ""Hey, I know I brought that up before, but I realized that it actually kind of hurts to hear you rank 9 of my classmates ahead of me/rate me 6 out of 10/keep calling me cute when you call other people hot/whatever. Can we talk about something else?"" He'll probably be taken aback and stammer an apology and then stop saying shit like that, and you can both move on.

Take this as a life lesson: it's *actually okay* to not dig in on why your boyfriend thinks you're a 6/10, or precisely what makes your classmates hotter than you. Seriously! As long as you're happy with yourself, he does not need to think you're the hottest woman on the planet. It's probably not going to be helpful to spend time mulling it over and deciding that you'd prefer to have a boyfriend who rates you at least a 7/10. 

It's enough to know that he thinks you're attractive, you think he's attractive, and most importantly you find *yourself* attractive, and be happy with that."

To provide another perspective, I was very angry with my sister for this. I wanted one thing that was MINE. After a lifetime of sharing milestones I didn’t want to share yet another one. She was dead set on getting married quickly, so we postponed our wedding a year. It hasn’t been an issue since, but I’m still a tiny bit pissed.

(And then we ended up having kids at the same time. Being a twin is weird.)"
455,"Same team, please OP try to speak to her. You act like if there was only the fact that you are a quiet guy in the equation, do you love her? If yes you have to try to speak a bit of HER language of love which is attention and talking."

This would be a really difficult revelation for any couple, and coupled with your mental health issues, you shouldn't rush into anything.

457,"Counseling for your daughter and yourself could be really helpful if your wife refuses to go. Similar to how there are family support groups for alcoholics, you can get support as family of someone with an undetermined mental issue.

Set a hard boundary and if she crosses it then move on. You can find a more mature and respectful partner. After all, you have a swanky job in City Government."
460,That's called gaslighting. Making you think you're remembering wrong by lying about the situation. 
461,"On one hand, I understand why he hid being trans. He doesnt want to transition, especially not publicly. Which means, for the foreseeable future, he is completely male presenting. He is obviously comfortable enough being addressed with his male name, dressing male, etc so coming out to anyone really doesnt seem logical. 

But, on the other hand, *he proposed to you* before telling you. That is a huge nono in most trans communities. Non op, pre op, post op, it is always recommended to tell your partner around the ""serious"" mark of dating out of respect and so the other person can decide if this is something they are comfortable with and can handle for their foreseeable future. Your fiance completely took that right away from you by not disclosing his gender to you earlier when it was easier for the both of you to walk away. In a way, what he did is like manipulation. He lied about himself to get you to stay with him, and that is not acceptable.

I think the first thing you need to do is decide if you want to stay with him. Personally, I advise leaving him because of your lack of sex life, his manipulation of who he is, and the fact youre only attracted to masculine *men*. But, give yourself a few days of no contact with him to think this through. Can you handle it? Is it worth it? Will you still stay if he does choose to transition? Remember, that it is acceptable for you to leave him over this. People might give you shit for it, but he manipulated you into thinking he was someone he is not so you wouldnt leave him. 

Second, talk to a fertility doctor and have some tests done. See how much time you have left, and your likelihood of getting pregnant. Talk to your doctor about your options and go from there. 

FWIW, Im nonop trans, but am publicly out. "
462,"I can only tell you that I would get the abortion. I have spent years in abusive relationships and they always get worse over time. There is nothing to save here. He has no respect for you at all. Screaming happens now, but soon enough it will be screaming and hitting.  Abuse always escalates. Sometimes it takes years, but it always escalates. Any children will just be more victims for an abuser and often creates a hostage situation.  Do you want to be in a custody dispute with this asshole? 

There is a whole lot of amazing things you can do with your life, but not if you stay and let this guy beat you down mentally and physically. "
463,"&gt;When he gets home from work tonight I would be gone with all my shit.

And take the cat with you."
464,WHOA! 3 months old and 6 pounds? That is definitely NOT normal and I would say that is a very very sick baby. I would be asking what the baby weighed when it was born. Unless it was premature and has put on significant weight in those 3 months (not likely) that baby... is seriously not in good shape. I would call CPS immediately based on weight alone.
465,"Thank you so much!

I often think back to the proposal and how I absolutely surprised her. The moment when we were both crying and I was on one knee, will always be burned into my mind. Those sorts of loving moments keep me going in the dark hours. "
466,"I agree *but* if he wants to save the relationship he should probably mix in a few ""we"" statements too - couples that face problems as a team tend to stay together.

It's important to set boundaries about his needs, but don't lose sight of the partnership - the solution to one partner being selfish in the past isn't for the other to be selfish now, the solution is to start working *together*."
467,"Why are you dating him? 

Doesn't really matter how he ended up that way. Better to deal with the fact that he's delusional and face that and figure out what you want to do about it. You can't fix him or change him. You can however, stop dating him. "
468,"Absolutely your wife needs to step up, but I'm curious about something.

&gt;only a couple of years ago I've realized what a shitty husband/friend I'd been to not just my wife but our circle of friends too. Since then I've been attending therapy online (I know it's not the best, but I'm better in text than speaking) and getting better. Basically I come from a long proud line of narcissists and while I and my therapist don't believe I have the disorder itself, I had a hell of a lot of the traits and behaviors associated with it. Through therapy and basically just seizing control of my own worse impulses, I'm making good progress. 

How much have you talked to your wife about this? Have you had any frank discussions with her about your revelation and your efforts? Apologized for being a shitty husband and been direct about what you're trying to improve? How were you shitty before and how are you doing better now? It sounds a bit like you may be discounting the effect of 6-7 years of a having a partner who is cruel, or dismissive, or whatever you did.

None of which lets her off the hook, of course. But I'm also curious whether you have discussed with her the bigger picture and pattern of behavior you see in her, rather than individual problems? I mean sitting her down and telling her she seems overwhelmed and depressed and you want to help her feel better and do better, instead of asking her to clean the catbox, reminding her to do her work, whatever? I've had a come to Jesus moment with my partner, and it really was a wakeup call to him, and the kick in the pants he needed to get on an SSRI and go to a therapy session. That was 3 years ago, and we're still together, and happier than ever. So it's possible. And if it doesn't work, you'll know you did everything you could."
469,"&gt;Jen’s family, however, is VERY conservative and VERY religious.

They may claim to be, but clearly they only throw stones in certain directions. 

&gt;The next morning no one said a thing about Sarah and Matt obviously having slept in the same bed, but whatever it’s their life (also, Matt is not yet divorced from his ex). It just kind of upset me that the rules seem to only apply to some people.

These people are giant hypocrites. I do not understand how other religious people can accept dysfunctional, abusive, or adulterous relationships so long as they are between a man and a women. God forbid you meet a person and have a wonderful, fulfilling, loving relationship with that person and provide a good environment to raise kids!! That's not important, gotta look at their genitals first!! 

Bottom line: if they refuse see past the fact that you aren't a man, and accept you for who you are as a person and the fact that you make their daughter happy, then they don't deserve a relationship with either of you. I wouldn't want to attend family events if I were you, and your fiance is amazing for sticking by you and not wanting to attend either. Don't let her go alone, it will be nothing but constant attacks and hypocrisy. Do something together, and get working on your own family memories instead of trying to hold on to toxicity."
470,"I just want to share a couple disjointed thoughts as someone with a very similar experience with my mother growing up.

1) Most important: this is what she is doing in front of you, that you know about. If your impression is this bad and dire, just imagine the interactions, comments, and behaviors your kids have experienced with her when you're not around. Kids don't know what is and isn't normal. Don't assume that you currently have the full picture; its possible that it is far, far, far worse

2) At 14-15ish, I was already making plans and daydreaming about being a couple of years older so that I could move away and go completely no contact.

3) You keep saying that you try things and your wife gets mad. So what? Let her get mad. Let her stay mad. You HAVE to be able to hold your ground. Your children won't be able to

4) You need to set real and concrete consequences for her continued behavior."
471,"&gt; Yes, I am hoping that the text where she said ""Hey, relax"" means I am getting them back, no fuss.

You should clarify that. Respond and make it clear that you expect them returned ASAP on her dime."
472,"&gt; Was hoping things would get better

That's never a good basis for a relationship. "
473,"The fact you felt the need to look out for these things is what's worrying to me here. Clearly this isn't a functional relationship, whatever she did or didn't do."
474,He tries to say I don’t remember things correctly when he does something wrong. I’ve never recorded anything else besides this because I had to make sure he didn’t use that as an excuse.
475,"&gt; If your uncles are hurt, its not your mom's fault

Quoting for emphasis.

The fact that Grand-dad is all about protecting those two's feelings might explain why she was closer to the brother who passed away than the others."
476,"This is bullying and 10000% has to be elevated to the authorities in your brother's school. I would also report those accounts to Facebook or Twitter or what have you and say that not only are they fake accounts pretending to belong to your brother, but that they are saying hateful things towards other users... hopefully they'd pull them down based on that."
477,"Took my wife to South Africa for a cousin's wedding after we'd been dating for 3 months. We've now been together for 7 years, half of that time as a married couple. I'm actually of the opinion that trips like this are a really good way to determine compatibility."
478,"I’m a little confused. If he’s not working and he’s not doing chores and you don’t have children, what’s he doing all day? Is he even *looking* for work? What’s his plan?

If his reasoning for all this is depression, is he treating his depression?"
479,"I understand why the elopement idea sounds appealing and if that is really truly what you want, great, do that. 

However I don't want you to look back and regret the fact that you changed your wedding just because your sister is being ridiculous. 

Your sister is being silly and selfish. No one gets to blank out the time before or after their wedding. There is no 'thunder' to be stolen. Weddings are about commitment, not getting attention, putting on a show or having the most guests. 

Unless there are problems between your fiance and yourself that you are not telling us about, it was manipulative of your sister to suggest that you are rushing your marriage. 

I think you should go ahead with what ever wedding you want to do and your sister just has to deal with it. 

&amp;#x200B;"
480,"Good lord! If I were you, I would keep J around as B-repellant for as long as humanly possible."
481,"Some people...geez. I am SO sorry this happened to you--it is definitely really shitty.

You have the option of filing a police report for destruction of property, and you also have the option of taking legal action. I think you could sue for ""conversion"" as a civil suit, though since your ornaments value was primarily sentimental, I'm not sure how well that will go (intentional infliction of emotional distress may be an option as well). It all kinda depends on the jurisdiction you're in...

I do hope you are able to solve this problem and recover damages for it. Also, probs also good to recommend she get professional help--sounds like she desperately need it."
482,"&gt; My partner is refusing to work full time hours at his job and is blaming me for the lack of income. What do I do?

Go be the single parent that you already are, minus one whiney dependent? 

I dunno, OP. You can’t make him want to work. He never really has. He prefers the Chateau du Mom and Dad, where the meals are complimentary and the bill never comes due and he’s responsible for nothing but wiping his own ass. 

It goes without saying that you need to stop having kids with this guy."
483,"&gt; I guess i dont understand why i should force myself to do something i enjoy less just becuase society dictates its ""good for me.""

I agree that if this makes you guys genuinely happy, you do you.


but 


my sister brings her partner to every.single.goddamn.thing. that we try to do together and I haven't hung out with just her alone in probably two years. when I try and explain that I'd like to spend some quality time with just her and I, she reacts a bit like you. and it kind of makes me not want to see her that much. 


just something to keep in mind. 
I have nothing against my sister's partner but that doesn't mean that I don't want to see my sister alone sometimes."
484,"I would absolutely move without telling him. However, I wouldn't buy. Your name will show up in records that he could find. I would rent for a while first and make sure you're safe before buying a permanent home. (Unsolicited, I also bought with the amount of money you propose, and still wish I had had more in savings. It worked out, though.)"
485,"You mentioned a cultural barrier,  so your in-laws don't happen to be Vietnamese?  In Vietnam the second name is actually the given name of a child. So maybe your in-laws don't really know that the second Name is not the real name? Even if they're not Vietnamese this could be a thing in their culture as well.

But I have to agree with other comments - if this really bothers you,  your husband will have to grow a spine and explain the whole thing to your in-laws. "
486,"Ohhhhh boy. She’s just grasping onto any control she has whatsoever. Just can’t let you be happy. First I think it’s perfectly fine if you had already discussed it to travel while engaged (I’m respecting that you have a very different culture than I) as you will be protected, and it will give you these wonderful memories before you get married and focus on the rigamarole of life.   

If I were you, without disrupting the harmony of the home, and because I’m naughty- I’d allow her to think everything was going according to plan, and I would not share anything I was doing personally with her. I would plan the trip with your fiancé as if none of this had transpired. While I understand your family is very close, once you are engaged and set to marry someone going into a strong field... won’t that set you free a tiny bit? She is in a five month relationship (hey, when you know, you know) whereas you are deeply committed and planning a life with someone, and you’ve communicated every step of the way.  

I’d just disappear one day, and let your parents know that you are safe. I mean on the trip. Don’t make a big deal, just have your bags packed and hidden away and just go. You guys will have the time of your life, and when you come back you get married. No one is going to fight that tooth and nail.  

If your parents are angry with you they won’t stay that way, and she can sulk in the corner all she wants. This is *your* life and *your day* 

You might not have another chance to be naughty and have fun in such a safe and pure way. Give yourself this. You’ve worked so hard for it. "
487,"He's actively sabotaging your attempts to become an independent adult, not helping you with college and making you quit your job. He's not going to let you go. If you lose this job, what's to prevent him from finding excuses to ban you from getting a new one?

Right now, you have employment. You have a shot at this with your savings and a job.

Are you sure you can't move out? I'm not talking about a nice place, but plenty of people live their first independent years in shitty 3 roommate apartments eating rice and noodles until they get clear."
488,"&gt;I recorded the whole ordeal so he couldn’t lie and say that never happened.

Is this something you find having to do a lot with him? "
489,"That was a super unkind thing for her to say. It wasn’t your fault. It’s not like you chose these things. The reality is that pregnancy is terrifying, and parenting is MORE terrifying, so she better get used to it. "
490,"&gt; I know what the right thing to do is, forget what my parents think and move on with my life; but at the same time, it really hurts me that they can't just accept my decisions and my SO as long as it makes me happy.

Here's a harsh truth for you:  Your parents are old-fashioned bigots, and they're never going to accept your girlfriend.  Ever.  So stop worrying about what they think, because you already know they're not going to change.  Live your life for you and not for their approval."
491,"I’ve always thought it had something to do with our kids growing up and needing her less. Our younger son used to be a mamas boy but ever since he turned 8 he became fiercely independent. He plays with his own friends outside and my wife can’t keep up anymore. He skateboards and rides his bike around so my wife literally can’t catch him sometime. 

Our daughter is more of a homebody but still, no one wants their mom at a sleepover. My wife is obsessed with the idea that the girls will talk about bad boys and sex and drugs when left alone and that’s why she thinks she needs to be there. She believes it’s her job to “guide” their conversations and mold their minds before it’s too late."
492,"Simple take away his power by telling your boyfriend about what happened.  

If your boyfriend breaks up with you over that, then he is not a good boyfriend in the first place.  

Can you change your number maybe? 

I would start documenting everything he sends you. 

I feel like this goes beyond simple harassment and is basically blackmailing you.  If you don't do this, then I will do this.  Maybe ask in r/legal for smarter ideas? 

I would recommend seeing a therapist to get a better idea of what this guy did to you, to control you such.  Hopefully, understanding that would prevent you from falling into a similar toxic situation in the future.  "
493,[deleted]
494,"Then do it.

Stop putting your career and financial stability on hold. She is welcomed to join you, but either way *move forward.*

Outcome independence is crucial. She's used to getting her way and you sacrificing your wants to move when she needs to. This is a game changer to that dynamic. She probably doesn't take you seriously and won't until you finalize your plans... Expect a full meltdown: crying, her feeling ""abandoned"", even accusing you of not caring about her. 

**You will still need to push forward because this move is right for you, and what's right for your relationship if there is any chance of it continuing in a healthy manner!** The status quo is untenable."
495,I have to agree. The choice to abort isn’t one to be taken lightly but in this situation it sounds like the best one. Please don’t bring a child into this abuse and avoid tying yourself to this man for 18 years. Please get out safely.
496,"None of those people sound like your friends. Friends don’t take joy in their friends’ infertility, nor do they remain silent when other people in a group chat do so, nor do they send screenshots to the subject of the comments for the purpose of hurting them. 

That being said, actual good friends can add so much to your life. Not just in times of stress like divorce/illness/death of a loved one. They also add a lot of joy and it’s worth making the effort if you find people that you think you could be friends with. "
497,"Yes, this. 

“I love you but I am not ready to fully commit to a family, and I don’t know what the future holds for me.” That doesn’t make you a bad guy, OP, she should honestly expect this from someone so young. "
498,"These other comments are surprising to me. Maybe I'm the only one who takes personal space seriously?

If the mother tries it again, gently &amp; sternly tell her that people dont touch you that way, ever. If your fiance has a problem with you asserting yourself, then the relationship might have a bigger problem. "
499,"&gt; When I tell him this, he admits that he’s known for a few days now that he might have one, but has not gotten tested yet. I ask him why he didn’t tell me this before having sex and he says he was scared I would be grossed out.

That confirms everything she told you, AND it shows that he's willing to lie to you.

You should absolutely run for the hills. He's a liar. 

Get out."
500,"Your parents are able-bodied 50 year olds who *chose* to have five children. Why can't they pay for your (now adult) sibling's care?

This is NOT your responsibility. Look up the word parentification because it sounds like this is what your family has done to you over the years. This often happens to the one kid in a big family who chooses to be responsible. It happened to me.

Don't fall for their guilting bullshit. This is NOT your responsibility and the people trying to put the burden of other people's responsibility onto you are abusive. You should distance yourself from anybody who doesn't support you in this matter.

Don't allow people to yell at you, least of all for 45 minutes. Tell them to call back when they can discuss things like civilized adults and hang up. Don't let this abuse perpetuate and continue. Teach them how you are to be treated, and if they can't get on board, cut them out entirely - the whole fucked up lot of them."
501,Ask her out. Take your shot. Tell her you have a crush on someone with her first and last letter too. 
502,"I’d like to chime in about the ‘best friend’ thing: the closest thing you’ll ever find to a confirmed ‘soulmate’ is a best friend with the same life goals and sex drive as you. Don’t let anyone fool you into thinking you need to have an epiphany or for God himself to come down and tell you: your soul mate is a best friend whom you promise to love and put first and work things out with.

However, this woman has kids already, and that’s not a part of her life you want to share in. Please don’t give those kids a promise of a ‘father figure’ if you don’t love them and aren’t truly prepared to take care of them. You’ll end up resenting the kids, and the mother by extension. You owe yourself, her, and her kids the chance to find someone you click with on ALL levels."
503,"&gt;We have never had this kind of family drama.

You mean ""We have not had this kind of family drama since B molested me and my parents disbelieved me.""

If your sister and B want to imagine that J has a force-field around him that pushes them away, that is their game and you are not obligated to play along.

B is contriving a reason to set your sister against you. If it wasn't J it would be something else."
504,"Your girlfriend just committed a felony. And she's a piece of shit for doing so. What was her plan if they refused to refund the money? Just let your neighbor take the hit? And that's aside the fact that she stole something in the first place.

Oh, and this probably wasn't her first time, or her last time, either. She had to have a preordained plan to *steal his credit card information.* That's not pocketing a thing of lipstick at CVS dude. This is bad, and you need to let your neighbor knows his CC info was stolen by your girlfriend."
505,"If you end up distancing yourself from your friend (which is already starting to happen - you making excuses to avoid her at her house), she's going to feel hurt. If you tell her that her father's behavior and comments when he's drunk make you uncomfortable, she might be hurt. Since she's going to be hurt either way, I'd go with telling her the truth. Don't say it in a way that makes it her problem to solve, though. Just tell her something like ""Your dad made repeated sexual comments to me when he was drunk. I didn't know how to handle it in the moment, so I just pretended I thought he was joking, but he kept escalating his comments. I no longer feel comfortable being around him or at your house."" 

Use your judgement on whether or not to tell her the specifics - it might hurt her more, or she might ""need"" to hear what he said so she doesn't brush it off as ""just a joke."" Do be prepared for the fact that she might not believe you, or that she might pressure you to ""let it go,"" and that he was ""just joking."" It might be hard for her to accept that her father did that, and there's the whole victim-blaming thing, too. But if she's your friend, give her chance to know the truth. You're distancing yourself anyway to avoid her father, so I'd risk telling the truth, even if it leads to the end of the friendship."
506,It’s pretty clear he didn’t want to spend time with his family so I’m not sure why he brought you along just to ditch you. I would break up with my boyfriend if he brought me to meet his family and then ditched me for six days during the trip. No way would that fly. 
507,"OP, you said in one of the comments that your father passed away when you were 16... I feel like that is extremely important information you might want to edit into your post. It explains a bit of *why* she might be behaving this way. 

Grief is a strange creature that can cause some pretty extreme cognitive distortions and fear. She just lost her husband, and she is terrified to lose you, too. But, she needs some real mental help. Help that you can't give. 

She needs therapy to deal with her grief and fear of abandonment. These are all normal *feelings* for her to have, but the actions they are causing her to take are SUPER unhealthy. She can't see that she is actively *causing* you to pull away, so she doubles down instead. You aren't going to be able to just *talk* her into being reasonable - she won't listen. And will likely just take it as further proof that you want to abandon her or that you think she's crazy. 

Does your mother have any friends, family, a church group.. *anyone* who might be able to get your mom to see that she needs help?"
508,What is this trend of people thinking they're over-reacting when they're being legitimately emotionally hurt or dismissed?
509,"Don’t bother with a chance to correct the behavior. He’s well aware that he’s doing the bare minimum, and someone who’s tactless enough to have people all over a property that isn’t theirs with no real apology or correction when you’re impacted by their actions (dog getting out) isn’t actually going to respond to your clear messaging positively. They just won’t. They have shown you that their idea of decency is different from yours. And he’s already labeled as a hot head. 

“Hi Cousin. Wanted to give lots of notice; this summer I’ll need the dock for other uses (a friends boat, maybe you wanna put chairs on it and use it as a porch-dock, maybe you have a hobby that requires it, maybe you’ll be restaining it, maybe a volunteer group needs it, whatever!!!), this will be effective May 1st. Thanks!”

Offer nothing else. If he gets funny about this? “I was really happy to offer it when I could man, I just need it going forward for my property.” Act politely weirded out that he’s feeling so entitled. 

And when the plans for the dock don’t happen and he asks? “Nah it fell through. I’m just gonna use it for my own stuff going forward, it’s a lot to have people in and out.” Etc."
510,"This. She needs a job, a hobby, an art class, anything. If she doesn’t, she will RUIN your daughters young adult life, and your daughter will never forgive her for being a helicopter mother. It has taken me over a decade and a half to forgive my mom for being a helicopter mother, and that was only through years of therapy. "
511,1. No idea 2. It’s a three day drive if you don’t stop driving 3. Nope
512,"
&gt; I believe his attitude is hypocritical, selfish, and somewhat demeaning and controlling. I think it's childish.

That's because it is.

He is acting like your happiness and independence is a threat to your relationship because it's not what *he* wants. It's bullshit. Happiness and your bond with others isn't a zero sum game.

""BF, my friendships and happiness aren't a threat to this relationship unless you make it that way. They make me a better person and partner, so unless you have legitimate grounds to see them in conflict, I'm not indulging this conversation any more."""
513,"I love this advice! Especially the gold ornament. It would create such a stunning affect (and you can get a plastic ball so if she tried this again it won’t be as effective).

Then file a police report against her for harassment, abuse (especially with the walking around half naked and walking in on people in the shower some sort places would count that as sexual harassment at least), and destruction of property.  As others have said even if nothing can be done it’s on file!

I am ashamed to share a name with this creature and I hope OP can salvage her ornaments. I broke one of our family ornaments one year and I cried for the whole day (or at least it felt like it). I would probably murder someone who did it on purpose."
514,"He wouldn't even be with her all day. Only after noon. They'll get some time to themselves, I don't see how this ends poorly if they're both somewhat normal people (like not addicts or narcissists, or love to cause weird issues)."
515,"\&gt; Nothing prior really triggered this, but she proceeded to grab my hand and when I wanted wanted her to let go, after my fiancee indicated her to stop, she proceeded to flick me really hard right in the middle of my forehead. &lt;

This sounds like something that shitty people do, it shows up on /rJustNoMIL usually in the form of pinching or ""horse bites"" and other crap.  It's not directly hitting but it hurts and it's annoying.  I'm not surprised that you didn't like it.  Honestly, if mom is OK doing it to someone she doesn't really interact with, I'm really surprised she hasn't been told off or punched in the face over it by now.  I would talk to her about it directly and explain that while she thinks its cute or funny, you don't like it and could she please keep her hands to herself in the future.  "
516,"Honestly whatever you do with the deported ex, break it off with your current girlfriend. Nice and attentive are adjectives for a waitress, not somebody you are in love with."
517,"I second this, report him to the police immediately. "
518,"""Oh shit, she looks AMAZING. Better knock her down a few pegs."""
519,"This is higher level than reddit. You both need therapy, especially your wife"
520,"Honestly, I’d consider going to the police with this. He assaulted you. They may not be able to do anything, but this is exactly the kind of behavior that people will dismiss years from now because it was never reported.

One of the reasons this guy and men like him feel like they can get away with this behavior is because even though he is the criminal and you are the victim his crime puts you in a lose-lose social and professional situation.
If you report there will be people who tell you that you are over reacting and you may lose work connections and opportunities as a result.

If you don’t report there are people who will act like you are co-signing his behavior and agreeing that this isn’t a big deal (“if it was so bad why didn’t you report it?”). 

This *is* a big deal, and maybe a visit from the cops would help him recognize that.

All that said, you have no blame *at all* in this situation. Please, please, please do whatever feels right to you. This is a time to take care of yourself and your needs."
521,"Imagine how weird the opposite would be. The guys going away for over a week to Hawaii and didn’t bother inviting her, despite her being able to come. How shit would you feel."
522,"Your first priority is to get your sister away from him. 

Secondly, she's 16 and old enough to know the truth. It won't be a fun conversation but you need to tell her what's up. She needs to know why you two suddenly need to move, and that she needs to avoid him in the future. 

Collect any evidence you can. Block his contact once you move out. If he keeps trying to reach your sister or you, record that information and speak to police. "
523,"Whether or not she cheated, your mistrust seems to be running deep."
524,"A lot of people here are suggesting you break up with him over it but I completely disagree. From how you've written this it just seems to me that he doesn't attribute the same value to these photos as you do. He forgets to change/delete them, doesn't want to go through the effort of putting them on his computer, and doesn't see it as a big deal. You also mentioned that he takes a lot of photos (4000 +) which shows he just likes having memories and isn't fussed about going through them. He probably just doesn't understand why you're so fussed about them especially since you've happily been together 9 months. This, coupled with how batshit crazy the ex is based on the first few sentences probably means he isn't holding on to these because he still has lingering feelings for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I still have tons of photos with all my exes all in their separate albums on my computer. Even if some of those ended badly I do like remembering that part of my life, and seeing how I've grown since that relationship. To me deleting those photos would be like erasing part of my life. I hold no feelings for those men anymore but I also can't pretend like they never existed - its not healthy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think you need to really figure out why this is making you so insecure. Yes, you have always had problems with this woman but if you see no other signs of him (other than the photos) having feelings then I really think this is something you need to get over yourself. You need to realize your self worth, and what an awesome catch you are. your boyfriend probably sees it to which is why this is such a non-issue for him.

525,"Yes, you need to tell him. 

Do you want children? Does he? If you both want children, would he/you be open to adoption? Have you talked about your future goals? That's a discussion you should have soon, if you haven't already. (For example, if you don't want children and he does, you've got a dealbreaker regardless of whether you can physically carry a child.) 

Just sit him down and tell him you need to talk to him about something, that you've been nervous to tell him, that it's scary for you to talk about, but he should know. Then tell him about it. 

It's a little strange he hasn't noticed or asked about a period or birth control, to be honest. Though I don't know where you live and what your culture is. But, still, that's something a sexual partner should be discussing with you, particularly the birth control. You don't need it, but he doesn't know that. Does he just assume  you're taking care of it? 

I think there are a lot of discussions you two need to have. If you're best friends and if you are planning to be together long-term, you should be able to be open about these things. It's scary, especially because you've waited so long, but you need to talk about this, and children in general. Give him time to process the info, especially because it might conflict with his expected plans for the future. "
526,"Am I correct that you were buying him more than $5,000 worth of electronics and he snapped at you because you couldn't buy him everything he wanted?  That's a lot to spend on a partner at once.  Why couldn't he put the electronics on his presumably higher credit card?

""I was taking him to a movie and dinner, so the night was super awkward after.""  Is this why it's difficult that you don't have more money, because you're paying for everything?  Your SO should not depend on you financially to this extent.  If he were going through a hard time and you had to pay for the both of you on most occasions, he should me more gracious and appreciative.  You should really break up with him because, as you said, you are not a doormat."
527,"Thank you for your input and kind words.  

I did in fact contact Natalie about it and she was immediately ""on my side"". She apologized profusely for Nicole's behavior and said she'd talk to her mom and ask her about it. She was also shocked that she had let her 3 year old child play with strong magnets that he easily could have put in his mouth/swallowed. Natalie assured me that she would talk to her mom about it so I wouldn't have to deal with it right now, and that she'd find out exactly what she had taken and that I'd get everything back.

528,"As a host of many parties that some people unfortunately brought kids to...the parents rarely realize their kids are a problem. They blame you (the host) for not having enough activities to keep their kids entertained. Some people bring their kids to a party and figure that all the other adults there will be free babysitters, so they can ignore their kids all night because someone else will deal with them. I am pretty strict about parties being adults only now, and if that means people can't or won't come because they can't bring their kid, then they can miss out. "
529,"I’m gonna go against the grain here and tell you that I know some people who edit all pictures of anyone before they show them to people. They have apps that help them do it with just a couple taps. It’s not about finding particular people ugly, it’s like a thing about sharing photos that look “unfinished,” or they feel photos don’t do people justice, or whatever. I personally still don’t really get it but these people do it even to just landscape, food, and pet pics, which makes me feel like it really is more about their “photography” than anything personal.

I don’t know if this is the case with your girlfriend. I would take a look at other pictures she posts. Even if it is the case, it’s perfectly valid to find that weird/shallow and a dealbreaker."

He will continue to do so bc you fall for it (I know it’s hard not to since he is ur bf but .. he sounds extremely toxic and unkind). 

And tbh. Even once for that type of comment is enough. I can’t imagine ever saying that to anyone, especially someone I’m dating. It’s cruel and fucked up.

I cannot advise against this more. It sounds like she's into you. You have that going for you. But the whole vomiting feelings at the feet thing even if you just asked what seems like an innocent question is a bad idea. Even worse if you were going to do something like say ""I've always had strong feelings for you."" 

Ask her out on a date. Call it a date. Let her know its a date. A traditional date. Whatever you can afford to do that involves just the two of you hanging out, doing something fun, then having some getting to know you time over dinner and drinks. 

It sounds like her answer is already going to be a yes. But if its anything but an enthusiastic yes and lets set a day/time to do it then back off. 

This is how a lot of relationships start. People who are friends to best friends who eventually hook up. But if you put too much pressure on it before its even become official its going to die. "
544,"Dont try to be friends with your ex, please. It rarely works and usually only leads to heartache. You are not required to listen to his tirades, you are not required to keep him updated on your life (this is a man that has dumped you and said horrible, undeserved things to you). He said he wanted you dead because you had sex with someone else after you two broke up! Isn't that enough to realize that he's not all there in the head? If he were going to change and treat you better he would have by now. I would cut your losses and make sure he's blocked on everything on your end, there's no point in being subjected to harassment like that.

Also, you were and are never obligated to apologize or forgive him for: breaking up with you twice because he was chasing a fantasy relationship, trying to control you as a person even after you two broke up, saying he wishes you were dead (??? This man is crazy), blaming you for an accident that wasn't your fault and he KNOWS that, using your fears and emotional uncertainty to harm you (breaking up when grandpa died, saying you dont appreciate life because of the accident).

This man is using you as a fallback when his dream girl relationships don't work out because he expects and has taught you to be there for him whenever he wants you to. You deserve better than that. Don't trap yourself with him. If he ever approaches you again just say ""I don't have time for your inability to be an adult"" and leave the conversation. You don't owe him anything."

She said it wasn't appropriate and by going over I was giving the woman the impression I was interested in her. I never went over."
550,"I think this is a hill you die on in a relationship. You might want to cross post to /r/JustNoSo and see if they have any ideas, but my thoughts would be to first, to back up your kids and tell them that their mom is going through some things and you understand she's being overbearing and you've got their back. They 1) need to know that they have a parent who will support their healthy development and 2) your wife may tear the family apart if she can't get help for herself and you need to look after your kids first.

Second, you need to tell your wife that therapy isn't optional for your marriage. I'd suggest starting couples counseling and possibly look into individual therapy for everyone. 

Bottom line, if your wife can't pull herself back and won't get help, you might have to divorce her and take the kids for their own emotional well-being, so keep that in mind and be ready to get your ducks in a row (don't move out, speak to a lawyer on what you need to do to gain primary custody, figure out finances, etc).

These days there's a lot of information about transgenderism. It sort of makes sense to talk about it within a limited group, to figure out how to be a proper friend, if this topic is something one is ignorant about. But talking to more people seems like this is not about being a better friend to you. Noteworthy too: you didn't get an apology, they didn't think they were in the wrong. 

It seems like these people only see your transgender side when they view you, OP, not who you are besides the gender. You've already lost their friendship. Find new friends. "

559,"Sounds like you might've fallen for the 80/20 fallacy. It's the idea that your partner gives you 80% of what you want in a relationship, but you've found someone who has the 20% your partner is missing and it seems like they're better for you overall. But actually perhaps all they have to offer is that 20% and you wouldn't be well-matched in the ways that you and your partner are. Yet that 20% is very alluring and can become pretty all-consuming as an illusion.

562,"I can relate to parts of this.  Feeling behind socially, not connecting to a parent.

In my case, my dad was putting in a lot of hours getting a business off the ground, and I was angry at him because my parents had divorced, and there was a long stretch where we didn't have that father-son connection.  It wasn't until I was an adult and figuring out my own career that I was actually able to have conversations with him where it felt like we were both interested in what the other had to say.  I know my example is different because I think there were some efforts on both sides, but I definitely get you on not feeling that bond and how it can shake you.

Some people don't connect with babies, and it's not until the child is speaking and manifesting its own personality that they start to bond.  For some it takes longer- teenage years when identities and fledgling interests are forming in their child.  For yet others, it takes longer - until the kid isn't a kid anymore.  Maybe that's your parents - they work with adults, talk with adults, and think in terms of careers and work.  I imagine that not-ever-bonding is an easy trap to fall into if you're relying on nannies to raise your kid - people normalize and don't think about things and then they look back and surprise!  Just regrets.

And that sucks- I'm sorry that your great 'what's my birthday' example didn't work to wake them up.  I'm sorry that they aren't putting in any apparent effort.  It's neglectful and you don't deserve that.  

On a level it's been a year or two since your nanny was fired, and that's a year or two where you've come home to nobody, and that wears on the spirit.

I'm kinda sitting here hoping and wishing that your parents are lying in bed at night, thinking about things, but still digesting or processing.  It's from that hope that some of the following advice sprouts:

I'd suggest that you maintain your attempts at a connection.  If you're torn up about this, it might be worth continuing to challenge them or raise questions to provoke some thought or try another wake-up call.  If nothing else, it would keep you from bottling things up inside, and repeated hammering at them with your message/feelings might get through to them.  Listening to you is a skill that they have to develop (sadly) and that comes with practice.

""Why did you have me if you're never going to spend time with me?"" (and then have ideas ready if they say ""What do you want to do?"")  

""Would it be possible to set me up with a therapist?  Because this loneliness at home is fucking with my head a lot right now."" (and if they say no, then say you'll try going through the guidance counselor - the idea here is to hammer home that it's serious - and if they do foist you off on a therapist like they did with the nanny, at least you have a therapist and someone you can work with when it comes to the bigger problem) 

""My friends say this situation is weird.""  (the lack of hugging, talking - this is pretty simple, just highlighting how it's abnormal, where they too might be assuming it's status quo)  

""Where do you see us as a family in ten years?  Do we ever see each other again?  Is it only on holidays?""  (If they say of course you'll spend lots of time together then you can compare to the current situation)

Those questions are only if you're up for it - if you sense the answers won't be too cold or heartbreaking.  Beyond that, you know, just remember the guidance counselor is a starting point if you need to talk to someone or get something figured out, and take care of yourself.  Nurture the relationships with the people who do care about you - so long as you care about your old nanny, you might want to do something for her for Christmas.  Find ways to show people close to you that you love and care about them, and work on that caring as a skill so you can avoid going down the same path your parents did.

The reason I raise the questions is because I think at your specific age you're old enough that you're not a kid anymore, you're self sufficient enough to not need a nanny, and you're not so old that you can be wholly left to your own devices or ignored.  Working with known quantities and having answers may be better than decades of wondering.

As a final note, I wouldn't say you're permanently fucked up.  People come out of being raised in cults or by abusive parents all the time- be that abuse physical, emotional, or neglect.  Many/most manage.  When I say focus on taking care of you, I mean that if you worry this is the case (that you're permanently damaged by this), you should look into getting help from a therapist who could steer you onto the right track or help bring things into perspective, as that one passage in the book did.  But even people without therapists find their way to break the cycle or become warm, loving, well-rounded people.  That may involve a few more starts and stops, but it's doable.  Having therapy or outside advice makes it *more* doable."

567,"When you get serious with someone who is a parent, you take on their children too. It's perfectly reasonable to not be ready for a leap like that at 24, but the reality of it is there is no way around it. There is no compromise when it comes to children.

One of the many bummers with adult relationships.. Sometimes everything is great otherwise, but there's one single (and not even necessarily negative) fundamental difference that can cause it to come crashing down.

You let him know that your body is the holy grail and if he wants access to it he better step up his game big time.

&gt;He says I'm being ridiculous

What the fuck.

Hon, this is all so far from okay it's insane. Your husband is a HUGE part of this problem. He's so broken from his clearly abusive, insane family, he doesn't know what normal is and clearly is incapable of setting boundaries.

Find a new couples counselor. Clearly the current one is not working. 

In addition to that, you need to lay down the ultimatum that your husband get into individual counseling to deprogram from his family's abuse or you walk.

Also, he needs to set clear boundaries with his family and defend you or you walk.

It's entirely possible this ends quickly in divorce. The situation is already really extreme. You can not and should not stay in this abusive situation if your husband will not commit to your defense.

586,"It kind of sounds like there are two different issues at play here. 

1) you are distancing yourself from your friends because because you realize they might not be your crowd. This totally makes sense, as sometimes interests change.  I completely agree that when you’re in a happy relationship you don’t really feel like constantly getting wasted and going out doesn’t have the same appeal once you’ve found your partner in crime. I think it’s valid that you’ve moved away from your friend group because it doesnt sound like you guys had all that much in common and may have grown apart. Plus I agree that your friend having an affair is really awful. 

2) that being said I do think maybe the concern (especially from your mom) comes from the fact that you should have friendships and a support system other than just your SO and with whom you socialize with without him. I don’t think that your relationship sounds unhealthy, but it is important to have friendships other than just your SO. I think divorce is a bit of an extreme example if your relationship is happy and thriving, but think maybe if you were to outlive your husband, you would absolutely need support from people who care for you and vice versa. Friendships are important, and a rewarding part of life, both receiving support and giving. You just have to find your people, and I think you’ve come to the conclusion on your own that your current friend group isn’t it. 

Edit: wording "
587,"My ex used to do this sort of thing whenever we had a conflict. He'd say one thing, I'd respond to it, and instead of responding to what I had said, he'd switch his stance to something completely different. As I addressed each of his arguments, he'd come back around to the first one. If I tried to point out that we were arguing in a circle or that he'd just contradicted one of his earlier points, he'd explode and accuse me of trying to make him feel stupid.

It's a tactic to avoid communication. That's the opposite of how people should behave in a relationship. Also, the ""Can I just ..."" and then going back to playing a game instead of actually talking things over is stonewalling. That's emotionally abusive."

A job won't help.  There was a post here from a 19 year old whose mom called the  campus police when she didn't answer her texts.  Your wife is shaping up to be just like that mom."
595,"This is disrespectful...they don't respect your right to name your child. That's not her name. Have your husband tell them plain and simple since there's a language barrier there. Do they live close, are they over often? "
596,"I know you don't want to believe this, but her behavior is unhinged. She knew it wasn't healthy to start a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old when she was 24. She knows it's not fair to pressure an 18-year-old into marriage and children. This is not a mentally healthy woman. She does not have your best interests in mind. 

The best thing you could do would be to end this and try living a normal teenage life. With some distance and perspective, you will see this situation very differently. Please consider it. "
597,"So he basically doesn’t parent at all and uses you for free childcare?

Boy, bye."
598,"You don't hang out with women alone. Is it possible that she's trained you not to have friends who are women? Maybe not explicitly banned you from it, but at the start of the relationship when you'd mention female friends, maybe she'd grow cold, given you the silent treatment or picked fights?

I'm asking because I've been in that position before. I'm gay, and I have an ex who had some issues with other gay men. He found any of my gay friends, except anyone who he deemed unattractive, to be a threat to our relationship. And like I suggested above, he never outright banned me from being friends, but anytime I would try and make plans with my friends, he would pout, or start a fight, or insist on going with me to meet them but then wanting us to leave after an unreasonably short period of time. So I found myself hanging out with them less and less.

When we broke up after two years (he was cheating on me, surprise projection), I found myself with zero gay friends because he had trained me to phase them out of my life.

I think that if you examine your relationship, you might find this to be true, and that she has maybe trained you in other ways too.

It's pretty apparent that she has some major insecurities, and she should seek out individual therapy to work on her issues, as well as couples counseling so that the two of you can learn how to communicate better."
599,"You are right, and thanks for your reply. I will also talk to the association about it and ask if they can provide me with another therapist, else I will just go away, look for help else where. "
600,"I do not know why people think Reddit is going to give them a definitive answer on whether or not their partner is cheating.

1) I'm not even sure why a mint would help cover up cheating. More likely it would be to cover up drinking (which might potentially go along with cheating, I suppose).

2) Almost every woman I've ever dated has taken off their underwear immediately after getting home. It's common to want to wear ""nice"" underwear for work things or going out.

3) She wanted to feel fresh before meeting and fresh before getting into bed. I've worked half days in the afternoon when I showered before to be fresh and then felt grimy before bed and showered again.

What even is a ""friendly meeting""? Was she meeting a client of some kind with no particular agenda to keep the connection fresh or was she going over to a friend's apartment because they are friends, and he got a new dog? This wording is at best ambiguous, and at worst hostile to the idea that your wife might just have friends she hangs out with with no agenda.

Unless you've had problems with cheating in the past this sounds paranoid. Describing all attractive men in her age range as dudes she might fuck is weird. She's likely to friendly with people her age, some of whom, statistically, will be men and some of whom, statistically, will be attractive. Unless she has a long history of affairs this pretty much sounds like it's all in your head."
601,"So he is ok with you not being invited to anything? That's crazy. What's going to happen if you have kids? They are invited but you're not? He needs to stand up to them and tell them that if he is attending anything, you will be with him. If they don't want you there then he won't be there. Of course you would take it personally, family is as personal as you can get. "
602,"Yeah I was initially on board with her when I thought she just wanted more single/passionate kisses outside of sex but I definitely agree that make out sessions that don't lead to sex are a little awkward. As a guy and all that really does is get you worked up with no release.

I completely agree that they should try to find other ways to physically connect that doesn't leave either of them unsatisfied. "
603,"once you have reached the point of having to preemptively gather evidence to defend what you know in your brain to be a fact, you already have no relationship with this person. you have no trust. you have no respect. you cannot be in a relationship with someone who does not have basic respect for your mental faculties."
604,"""BF, I know there are very attractive people in the world, but it's off-putting when you keep mentioning them. I want you to stop. I am starting to feel insecure.""

605,"I’m not sure you “realized” anything. I think you suspect something. I think it’s a bit unusual for her to go to a male’s apartment alone to “see his dog” anyway. But that doesn’t mean, nor having a mint or taking a shower, anything other than what it is. I think you should talk to her and tell her why you are concerned. Even if she denies it then you will have addressed it and she will be on notice. Her reaction or confession could give you the answer you are looking for."
606,"I was actually in this situation, I forgave my bf when he slept with my best friend, we had been together 3 years and just started uni. It was a horrible decision, the relationship got so bad, I could never let what happened go, he cheated on me more times after then, etc. Get rid of them both now and hopefully if you explain the situation to your dorm they'll let you switch rooms or break the lease."

608,"You chose to give up a full scholarship and took a job instead. No one forced you to give up an education. No one forced you to sacrifice everything for your siblings. This was your choice, and it’s not too late to complete your education. 

Sometimes you have to take care of yourself without worrying about everyone else, and if your boyfriend won’t stand up to his family for you, then maybe he’s not the right one for you. 

I get the feeling you’re not in the US ... is therapy an option where you live?"
609,"The way I read this, if your siblings started paying back their own loans NOW, you could fund your own education sooner. They are also adults now (the older ones, anyway). Consider treating them that way. Three years is really nothing especially if they never before had to pay a cent. "
610,"&gt;Even though I have approaches the subject a few times with her as her manager

You are *her manager*? Start acting like it. You are not her therapist and it's not your responsibility to fix her behaviour. It's her responsibility to start behaving professionally, and you need to tell her that. Or she needs to go."
611,"So if I’m understanding correctly, you have asked him TWICE to delete the pictures. He says they don’t mean anything. But then, after telling you he’ll delete them and that they mean nothing, he emails them to himself?

Girl, that is so shitty of him. It’s not like you’re asking him to delete pictures of them together from normal events, you’re asking him to delete explicit photos. He’s clearly holding on to them for a reason. The reason probably isn’t that he’s still in love with his ex, but he likes to get off to those videos and photos. If you’re okay with that, then it’s not a big deal. I wouldn’t be but that’s just me. Moreover, not only did he not delete them, he lied to you about it. Multiple times. That’s the bigger issue. "
612,"Like u/MainstreamMolly said, we're likely from different cultures. Here's my two cents:

1. Your go to stance should be ""I can't afford that right now"" or ""its not something I can do"". Never discuss money or finances with them again and don't get into specifics where you have to lie. Even if you think to yourself ""yeah I could afford it"", think of it more as an empty investment. Don't make empty investments. Offer alternatives like sitting down with them to figure out to make things work within their budget or recommending a financial planner. They'll scoff but it will eventually teach them not to come to you for money.

2. Never, ever tolerate anyone yelling at you or speaking to you disrespectfully. The second someone gets aggressive with you, no matter who they are, you tell them that they need to speak to you in a calm, respectful manner or you are hanging up. Then make good on that and hang up the phone. Don't pick up when they will call back to hurl more abuse but you do not have to take it. Again: never, ever tolerate someone yelling at you or speaking to you disrespectfully like your brother did.

You are not damaging your relationship with your family, they are. That's really important to remember. Your family and extended family want you to roll over because its easier for them. It may even look easier to you too. But it continues to show them they can treat you badly and that you will eventually do what they want."
613,"Thank you. It’s actually funny.. The friend group I’m in that consists of 3 other girls I grew up with from high school told me the same thing, to leave. They called out his behavior from day 1 of meeting him and are probably on the edge of their seats waiting for the day I break up with him. Shame on me for not listening to them.."
614,"Your bf is just an asshole, and you need to find someone more experienced at being human.

Um, this is a much bigger issue than the birthday gift. It doesn't sound like he considers you to be in a real relationship at all.

Why are you sticking around? This guy doesn't love you and doesn't put in any effort. So what's the point? You could actually be with somebody who values and respects you. You're wasting so much time here.

&gt;I feel like a brat for saying that. 

Why? It's the damn truth. I feel like you might suffer from some pretty severe self-esteem issues that have led you to believe that this is normal for a relationship. It's not. It's barely a relationship at all."
616,"End this dumpster fire of a friendship.

You were used. At some point in your friendship, the bride stopped caring for you outside of what you can do for her."
617,"An important part of being in a relationship is communicating with your partner. If you aren't able to do that, then it makes being in the relationship really hard for your partner. Your current GF is clearly projecting on to you, but it also sounds like you're not giving her much to go on. You should consider whether you and your GF are compatible if she does expect you to be more conversational in general, but you just don't want to. 

As for you being quiet, from the experiences you describe, it sounds like you're not just quiet, but _really_ quiet to the point where people are thinking, ""WTF is wrong with that guy?!?!"" Can you interact with people for basic functional things (going to the bank, buying groceries, work, etc.) or do you simply not talk at times when most people would say something?"
618,"My brother went through the \*identical\* situation as you, so I think his story is pertinent.

He dated this girl for a few years, and they loved each other. But he wasn't positive that he wanted to commit to marriage due to fundamental personality differences. He wanted to spend lots of time with friends and explore new places, and she wanted to settle down and spend most of her time with him. He got offered his dream job on the other side of the country and needed to move pretty suddenly. She wanted to follow him, but only if he was ready to commit (i.e. put a ring on it within a year).

He ultimately told her that if she's going to move, she should move for herself. She said she would only move for him. He dragged this shit on for months. He finally said yes, she should come. He cared about her a lot and had developed a strong relationship over years, so why not, he thought. So she quit her job for him. She started packing up. She was about to book a flight, when he finally admitted to himself that he just wasn't confident enough about their future. He broke up with her over the phone, just two weeks before her move date.

He does not regret breaking up with her. He believes it was the right thing to do. But he hates himself for how he did it. He was horrible to her.

It sounds like you don't want to get married to this woman. Don't let her uproot her life for you. Tell her the hard truth.

622,"After 3 years, I think it's safe to say what he's telling you now is true. I actually am very impressed by the level of trust and comfort you two have to be honest and it speaks volumes in a sense to his sincerity. I was once in a similar kind of relationship where my ex prior did not find me attractive and even went as far to say it to my face but this changed as we got to know eachother. People grow and change, especially after a lot of time together. You have a right to feel the way you do, but in my opinion, just let it be a thought and let it pass you know? After all this time, if he still felt that way I'm sure it would show by now. Best of luck!"

So he honors that agreement.  

Side note, I drove by that house and it’s got Christmas decorations up.  Looks more like a family is there.    

I feel like going to the house ringing the doorbell and seeing who is there.     "
627,"That's your truth. That's not her truth, though.

You had reasons for staying. But his abuse and your staying has consequences for everyone in the family, including you. 

What you seem to be missing with your lists of reasons for staying every time it is mentioned that your daughter is angry, is that you were an adult and you could make the choice. You looked at the danger and made a choice to stay. 

Your daughter was a child - she had no choice. She didn't get to chose to stay with an abusive father. Her childhood was just tumult and chaos and fear and now that's she's an adult, she's angry about that. Rightfully so. She has every right to be furious that adults who should've protected and cherished her and made her feel secure, instead made her childhood terrible.

You need to ACCEPT that your daughter has every right to be angry with you and give her the space she's asking for, and stop trying to dump all your adult reasons onto someone who is essentially an angry kid still in some areas."
628,"So instead of coming to you with his concerns and talking to you about them directly, he tried to play a game with you and manipulate you. WTF? Yes what he did was shitty and you have every reason to be majorly upset with him. Has he ever tried to play games with you and test you like this before? Right now, you have no reason to trust that he can communicate with you directly about his issues in the relationship and that is a big deal. Good communication and trust are the foundation of any healthy relationship."
629,Thank you. The problem is OP - not the poor girl who doesn't care about politics or movies (what an arbitrary list!)

632,"Do you find yourself walking on eggshells a lot to avoid triggering his anger? How has it evolved over the course of your relationship? Does he seem to get angry at many different people in his life and take this anger out in them, or are you getting the main brunt of it?

""Anger issues"" are a thing, but plenty of people who talk about having ""anger issues"" actually have control issues, and anger is just the tool they use to control people around them. 

I can't affirm that this is the case of your husband, and it's a very important distinction: if he *is* consciously or not using his anger to control you, then anger management therapy would be useless (because he can actually manage his anger fine, he just chooses to weaponise it), possibly worse than useless (because he'd be learning tools to weaponise it better), and the therapy he would need would be very different.

The thing is, there are plenty of posts here that clearly depict a person in a relationship with an abuser. This one is a bit less clear to me, but I would not at all be surprised that learning more details of your relationship revealed that it actually is pretty clear-cut. As it is you are in a relationship with someone who ""has anger issues"", is self-centered enough to make your orgasms his problem, mean enough to turn that problem back on you by yelling at you and being completely nasty to you about it, on your birthday no less, is (in a very optimistic interpretation) clueless enough not to understand why this would be upsetting to you (more realistic interpretation: this bit of willful ""cluelessness"" very conveniently lets him off the hook for facing the consequences of that reprehensible event)... And I'm most worried about the fact that he's badgering you into sex you don't want until you give in, which is just this side of marital rape. Again, the optimistic scenario is that he's just *that* self-centered that he doesn't notice or care. But I wouldn't be surprised to find out he knows perfectly well what he's doing and he just thinks he's entitled to sex from you regardless of how you feel about it.


It also occurs to me his anger will make it very hard to work things through with him, won't it? These are things anybody would find upsetting to talk about, and he in particular won't react well to being upset. Again, pretty convenient how it gets him out of you confronting him over how his behaviour hurts you."
633,"It's a big change, it's normal to be nervous. But your husband sounds like a wonderfully supportive guy and you guys can come to a solution that makes you mutually happy. Use the script to help you get over the nervousness and start the conversation (and stop listening to your mother so much). "
634,"I doubt your dad doesn't get bitten. He's just not allergic.

Fumigating works, but it is not 100% effective, and it's disruptive, which might be why he's resisting. He should get new beds, and put the bed legs in containers of mineral oil. The bedbugs cannot bypass that barrier, if you keep things from hanging off the bed to the floor (you don't want bedbugs climbing up the blankets). Bedbugs can take over a year to starve to death, so he would need to keep that up. However, the infestation would mostly clear in a few days, since bedbugs typically feed every few days (traveling from the clothes, etc)."
635,"&gt;We also talk about our relationships and sometimes sex


Honestly, I am not super comfortable with my SO revealing personal information about our relationship to same OR opposite sex friends, but I do acknowledge he has a right to discuss his relationship with others.


I am 100% not comfortable with my SO discussing our sex life with others at all; to me, sex is private and part of my trust in him involves him protecting my privacy.


So if the texts she read involved something she felt was a violation of her privacy, I see where she is coming from. 


I personally would ask myself: does my behavior feel honest to me? Does it feel right? 


And I think you're writing this post because your behavior doesn't feel honest or right to you; you're not lying, but you're facilitating/participating in a lie.


Forget his responsibilities for a minute: how do your own actions make you feel?"
636,Something here sits bad with me. Yes you should say no to the trip and also talk to him how it’s shitty that he framed a trip to DC as a reward when really it was only convenient to say that and was already a plan. This relationship is inappropriate.

638,"I struggled with the same dilemma many times.  I found that the best “politic” answer is to show up, wish folks Happy Holidays, and then slip out early without adieu.  If anyone asks “where did you go?” You simply reply that you had other obligations, but that you really enjoyed seeing your coworkers at the holiday time.

Allocate 1 1/2 hours to the thing, dress nicely, smile, and be gone.

639,"TBH, invading your sister's privacy is the least of the issue.

It's over.  He was horny after viewing your sister's pictures and tried to fuck you as a substitute.  Then when you didn't cooperate, he went right back to her pictures to jerk off.

Yep, pathetic is right.  Get an order for child support asap and tell him to leave.  Do not be surprised if he tries to get with your sister as soon as you put him out

"
640,"This. Please, OP be proactive about your future. Don't let a random girl control your future like this. If she gets pregnant, that is 18 years of being under the control of a selfish person. She will control your time, your finances and your life. You are 19. Go live life! You have plenty of time to find someone else. Also, if she is indeed planning on getting pregnant without your consent that is a huge red flag. It means that she doesn't see you as a partner. She sees you as an object that can be controlled and manipulated to make HER happy. Men, don't let random girls baby trap you!!!! "
641,"Maybe don't have sex for a while and get to know HER for herself?

She probably feels like she has to do it to hold onto relationships and resents it afterwards, sounds like."
642,"&gt;So once she came, Friday night we gave each other stick and poke tattoos of our lucky numbers.

I agree with your boyfriend, you were stupid for doing that. Although his judgement is on the actual tattoo (no it won’t prevent you from getting a job) whereas mine is—dear god, don’t do stick and poke tattoos. Dear god, the staph, the cellulitis (I’m a nurse, I have seen this firsthand)...unless your friend has an autoclave in her house, they are not safe. It is so stupid I actually wonder if that’s why your boyfriend is pissed and he’s just not mature enough to voice that instead of just dissing the whole thing. Or he’s just small minded, hard to say. Now, be careful with your potential cellulitis and be grateful you did a tiny stick and poke and you will probably be okay and DONT DO IT AGAIN. If you want a tiny tattoo, shop around for min prices at tattoo parlor. "
643,"If it helps, maybe let her know that she’ll have a better chance of getting a good position  when the kids are 18 if she’s doing something in the meantime, even if it’s just working part-time or even volunteering?

This is a really weird situation.  I feel like your wife must be having some kind of dissatisfaction in her own life and/or stress about your daughter growing up, but please don’t let this slide, OP.  It will end up being really harmful to your daughter’s relationship with her peers AND with her mom.  

Edit: I know it’s cliche to suggest therapy constantly in this sub, but is that a possibility? Either just for her or as a couple? It’s really not normal to be SO rigid and protective of your older children."
644,"Jeez, how controversial was this name that everyone refused to use it? "
645,"Damn isn’t he embarassed that he basically is like a little kid and you’re more of his mommy than a wife? 

Seriously ask him if he isn’t embarassed because you are and tell him that this won’t work if he isn’t going to help you. 

Love or not I would tell him I’ll kick him out and that he can come back once he starts taking this seriously OR he can stay and he’ll take first job he can and he can keep trying to find a better one while he works there in that “shittier” one. "
646,"You're right that it's okay to sometimes act out during a rough time... as long as you recognize and apologize for it. So, okay, he behaves badly and you call him out on it and he---

&gt; We haven't spoken in a week because I stood up for myself and said it didn't make sense for him to get mad at me for that, it was my money and my car and I wasn't being unsafe.

*This is so far from okay*. He would rather not talk to you for a *week* than give in. He's grooming you to believe that standing up for yourself is ""lawyering up"". 

And this week was Thanksgiving, and you probably had several days off from school, and you have law school finals coming up. He's prioritizing bullying you over loving you. It's reasonable that he feels embarrassed about his younger girlfriend buying him several thousand dollars of electronics, but he should at least react sheepishly and not controlling-ly. 

I know you don't want to hear ""break up"", but at least keep standing up for yourself and demand to be treated as an adult. The silent treatment is not an adult way of handling a conversation."
647,"He's worse than a jerk.  He's seriously creepy.  According to security expert Gavin De Becker (author of The Gift of Fear), when somebody ignores your ""No"" that is one of the biggest and most reliable red flags of a predator.

I'm not saying the guy is going to rob or do something else horrible to OP, but he has already demonstrated he doesn't care how she feels or what she wants.  He doesn't respect her right to make her own choices.  All he cares about is bullying her into doing what HE wants.  In a way, he has already victimized her, albeit in a fairly mild way.  But his behavior will only get worse with time.

According to Gavin De Becker, the best way to deal with people like this is just to ignore them as much as possible.  Don't tell them off or give them any reason to get angry with you.  Just give them the absolute minimum amount of polite contact.  Ghost them as much as you can."
648,"Your description of them being incompetent and probably formally evicting them is exactly why I don't want them around. I wouldn't put it beneath Scott to divorce my SIL and still not move out. I can't live in a situation where my home is a constant battleground. 

I'm not going to back down but I will talk to my wife tonight about this. Use some of the ides others have given me. "
649,That happened to a friend of mine. She got engaged to an already married man after spending lots of time with his family. The family didn’t say A WORD.  She found out that he was married when his wife contacted her. 
650,"I like this response.  Maybe you can also bring up the idea of a new path to use her skills and education in an entrepreneur style of path.  If no one will pay her, surely she can use the beautiful scenery of Washington to come up with online classes to teach, or maybe head up a non profit.  I think the key to getting her on board might be a new, better dream. What do I know though. "
651,"You probably have no idea how it smells since you're so used to it. That smell will get into your clothes and your hair and only washing it will help.

How many smokers realize that they smell?

652,"I don't have too much to add to the excellent advice here already, but maybe this story will help...

My Uncle is gay.  That side of the family is pretty conservative and republican.  Growing up we would see them 2-3 times a year - Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.  My Uncle would always be there, and often with a female friend.  I never thought anything of it; I didn't even know he was gay until after all of this had happened.  Looking back I think people knew but it was literally never talked about, not even once.  And my Uncle was very soft spoken and non-confrontational.

He had a partner we'll call Mike, and had been with the Mike for most of the time I had been growing up and beginning my life, but I had never heard of him or met him.  He died of cancer right around the time gay marriage was legalized, and they were never married.

My grandfather had never met Mike, and never spoke of him.  He came to Mike's funeral for my uncle though.

My grandfather was stunned.  He was surprised to see that so many people could love, respect, and appreciate Mike.  And he was ashamed.  He apologized to my Uncle, and said that he wished he had known Mike, he must have been quite a guy.  And my Uncle replied that he really was.

My grandfather died carrying a bit of that shame.  He knew he had done wrong to both my Uncle and to Mike, for over a decade, by excluding Mike.  And he knew that he could never make up for it as long as he lived.

In retrospect, my Uncle wasn't really that close to the rest of the family anyway.  Family is family, of course, but the only person he was close to was my Mom, who since moved away.  In hindsight, I think my Uncle would have been happier if he had simply created his own family holidays instead of trying to keep appearances up for others.

Toxic people and toxic beliefs have no place in a loving family, even if they are blood related.  And if your Fiancee were to bend to her family instead of understanding the consequences that this toxic behavior will end up having on her... She'll regret it for a very long time."
653,You need therapy for yourself OP.
654,So you have never told them that you want your daughter to be called by her first name?  Like...so tell them?  It sounds like you've really built this up into a much more insurmountable task than it actually is.  Give it a try before you decide that they'll never listen or that your husband will side with them.  
655,"Homie, your dad is a piece of shit who married a piece of shit and unsurprisingly spawned 2/3 pieces of shit.  

I too come from a bunch of shitty assholes, it's hard to cut ties, I know. You will be healthier in the long run. If you don't have a good therapist, find one. Process the shit they've put onto you and push it away. Be healthy, live well.

"
656,Like a girl who doesn't like when her BF has life long female friends? Lol
657,Your parents convinced you to break up with her because they didn't approve of her. You can't unring that bell no matter how much you say they've changed.
658,"Its so cringy when someone start singing aloud in public, especially if theyre being loud. "
659,Just say no. You want to stick with the original date.   Don’t say anything else.  Type that into the group chat.  
660,"Don't give her an ultimatum.

Tell her what you are going to do. ""Girlfriend, I'm going to Washington. I need to move my career forward and start having a stable life. I've put my career on hold several times for yours, but I'm not doing it any more. You can come with me or not.""

If she doesn't come, I'd consider it over. Part of the reason she's not being realistic about her career ambitions is because she doesn't appear to *have* to be realistic. Because from the looks of it, you're her get out of jail free card here.

So stop rescuing her."
661,"Reading this whole thing, I’m struck by a couple of things: how you admit to being a shitty husband for years before now, and how you’re writing this whole post to make her depression about how she can’t keep up with your great life. For someone who supposedly is coming to terms with their own narcissistic traits, it seems like you have some work to do here. You are not facing the same mental health obstacles as she is, so it’s not really relevant to write about how you’re busting your ass to do whatever. All your concern is about how it relates back to your own plight. Has your own therapy and this process of coming to terms with yourself focused at all on the effects you’ve had on her for the years you treated her like crap? You don’t get to declare everything fixed just because you behave better for a few months. I don’t know, I don’t think you’re seeing the full picture here."
662,"You did the right thing. I don't want children and no one can change my mind about that. It drives me insane when people say ""one day you'll change your mind."" I'm 24 and married. I'm not changing my mind. If a guy I was dating wanted children, I explained I didn't and it would be a waste of both our times to continue dating. 
"
663,"The kindest thing you can do for her is to let her go.  Be gentle, but be honest.  I have been ""her"" in this situation and would not want someone who does not love my children and questions their love for me to stay with me out of various forms of guilt.

You are not doing anything wrong by breaking up with her.  You deserve to be happy in life too.  It will hurt and you will feel guilt, but ultimately it is the right thing to do if you are not in love with her and do not love her children.  "
664,"Shes cheated on you my friend, if she truly wanted an open relationship then she would have sat down and talked to you about it before doing anything.

She has given no regards to your feelings and the fact that she has been physically abusive before and is now emotionally abusing you means you need to get out of there sooner rather than later.

Dont make the same mistake i did and stick around, she'll keep pushing boundaries until she cant and then she'll discard you. You are the exact same age as me and in a very similar situation. You owe it to yourself and your kids to get out of there and build yourself up"
665,"Uhhh I don’t understand how you ended up in two sexual situations with this girl unless someone was planning it. And why this was allowed to continue until you or him freaked out? Like nobody just said, “threesome, are you joking? No way”. 

Or you were interested and agreed and then backed out? I literally have no idea what I just read, other than it made me feel highly uncomfortable and I feel like somebody’s still into somebody (girl towards Jack, Jack towards Jill, both?). 

I totally think it’s fine to confide in a third party when crazy crap like this is happening around you, especially since you can’t confide with Jack because he’s involved and he’s defensive over his ex. 

Did I mention this is a train wreck?"
666,She's also being physically abusive.
667,"I think his fiance should work on her insecurities as they will only hurt her more moving forward, but you got an answer. He doesn't want you to be in his wedding party and thats the only answer he has to give. It is her wedding. And his of course, but he clearly has made his choice about it. Weddings are about the two people who love each other and what they want, not what anyone else wants."
668,Your dad sounds fucking awful. 
669,He must be a cringy person if he made a rap song about you. Yikes...
670,STAY. WITH. LEVELHEAD.
671,And hit the bell icon!
672,"Wow- to him the fact that he has the most pleasurable sex possible is way more important than being responsible and honoring your wishes... instead he picks them apart, tries to belittle you for how you feel, and has a huge temper tantrum. I would dump the fuck out of this guy."
673,Probably from a lifetime of being told that they're over-reacting and to stop being so sensitive 
674,"It is bad enough you caught him red handed once. I maybe, possibly could have chalked that up to being drunk and incredibly dumb. But the fact he picked up her phone again, thinking you were asleep... and then was caught red handed AGAIN, getting ready to stroke it... I am so sorry, OP. This is unforgivable. He definitely ruined your family, and I honestly do not know how (or why you would want to) to come back from that.

What a disgusting perv."
675,"She's actually added more info in her other comments; she actually *does* have another friend group, one she and her husband play board games and D&amp;D with.  All the more reason to ditch the losers from her younger days."
676,So wait...why does he still live with his abuser?
677,[removed]
678,I think the 'real' issue here is that this is a terrible company to work for. You are severely understaffed and therefore your colleagues vent their frustrations at each other. 
679,Except it actually does happen. Human trafficking/forced sex labor *is* a thing. Even with US borders; both the FBI and Justice Department have information on this on their websites.
680,"Yeah, there are tons of people asking for advice on Reddit who you can tell will never, ever accept that the problem could be with themselves. I think OP's basic willingness to accept that he might want to work on changing some aspects of how he presents himself already puts him in a much better place than a subsection of other people who have reached out with similar problems."
681,Plus they weren't married and didn't know each other's financial situations.  So many bad decisions...
682,The fact that he's irritated when you say no to unreasonable requests means he feels entitled to these favors from you. That's a red flag - he's entitled and has poor boundaries and is trying to force intimacy quickly.
683,"Ma'am, huge red flag here.

You should be his priority.

I'm a man and my mother was/is a piece of work sadly.  She's an emotional vampire, she abusive, controlling, mean and on and on.

When my wife and I were expecting our first child, my wife told me that my mother was not welcome at the birth of our first child and it was going to be her first ever grandchild.

I knew what she was like etc. so when my wife told me this, it was fine.  I let my mother know she would't be coming to the birth of our child.  Yes, she was beyond ticked.  She came like a week later.

My wife came first.

A birthday party is peanuts compared to the birth of a child.  If this man won't deal with things like this now, it will grow and fester between the two of you.

Imagine when you're about to give birth to your first child and looking around and seeing his sisters and the rest of them there...

How can you make him understand?  You can't.  You can tell him it's unacceptable and it needs to change.  No. Ifs. Ands. Or. Buts. About. It."
684,"Direct quote ""You really ruined this pregnancy for me.""   She then went on to explain that she felt like should couldn't tell me because talking about pregnancy would make the whole situation worse. "
685,"Yeah, unfortunately life continues to prove to me that nothing is fair. I’ve got that down. I don’t have the money, time, or the drive/energy to pursue this in small claims. I might actually be able to dig up some Neiman Marcus receipts from the 60s for a couple of the broken ornaments but even so...I just don’t think it’d be worth it (as much as I’d love to get some justice here)

John and I will take everyone’s advice and speak to our apartment manager to report what’s happened and see what our options are. We will move out of it comes to it. I will also be speaking to my friends about this and let those closest to her speak to her parents about this. A few mentioned that this could be the onset of a mental illness so I want her family to get her help if that’s the case 

Thank you so much to everyone who has read and commented! I am reading them all

687,"They never argue, because they never actually have any serious conversations."
688,"You pretty much just told him you were fine with it. If you aren't fine with it, don't tell him you don't mind it. "
689,"&gt; My big fear is I don't want to spook her.

Honestly, she seems excited that *you* have the opportunity to have this trip, so she should be even happier if you offer to take her along! If you simply say ""I won't be offended at all if you decide not to come"", the worst case scenario is that she declines and your relationship continues as normal. I don't see how it would be a ""HUGE mistake"" to invite her on this trip."
690,"Dude. Ask her. “Girlfriend, why is your birth control patch sunning itself on the windowsill?” Even if it weren’t a birth control sabotage method—and I’m going to take your word for it that it is—it’s a weird thing to do. 

I do weird shit all the time, but I’ve never tried to tan my birth control, and my partner can ask me about the weird shit I do. You clearly don’t trust her and don’t feel comfortable asking her, so don’t have sex with her. "
691,[deleted]
692,"Cop-wife, here. I would be absolutely mortified to mention my husband if I were stopped for some traffic infraction. If I'm dumbass enough to get pulled over, ***I*** want to be the first one who tells my husband, not his buddies.

I would *never* trade on his name to make my life easier... That's just trash behavior.  Being a family of law enforcement shouldn't make you above the law; if anything you should be holding yourself to a higher standard than your average citizen.

If I goof up, I will own up and pay the damn ticket (only ticketed two times in my life. Both times when I was a teen, now in my 30's)."
693,"This. I’m a twin and I’ll just say that I understand the tensions that can arise. 

Do whatever it is that you want; be that what you’d originally planned, a true elopement, or just your parents. Not what everyone else will be most comfortable with. What YOU and your DF want. 

Down the road, with the salve of time on this wound, either she’ll realize her mistake or she won’t. If she does, and is willing to repair the relationship, that’s great. If she won’t, then it wouldn’t ever have mattered about your wedding, because that’s who she is and it will be something else."
694,You know the answer. You don’t need Reddit’s permission to set reasonable boundaries with your family.
695,"Whoa. No. That is not your reality. I see where you think it is, but no. Being in an abusive relationship is not going to get you disbarred (unless you're committing some malpractice, right, lawyers?). Fired, maybe. Get to some therapy TODAY. You have the funds, and I'm assuming, the insurance. You aren't remotely out of options. I know it's easy to go down the road of hopelessness, but you have a kid to think about and your well-being to think about. 

Put a list together of what needs doing. Moving, childcare, lawyer for yourself, support system, therapy, budget, etc. Break it down into small chunks. Move through the list. Every step you take to get yourself and your child out of this will feel scary but freer. It can't stay this way, right? "
696,"Hey OP. I was in a similar situation but did the exact opposite of your girlfriend. My boyfriend paid rent and cable, so I paid utilities, vet bills and pet supplies, groceries and parking. Normally mine was $500 or so less, so I’d do all the laundry, and general cleaning and errand running. Our understanding was time is money so if I can’t help monetarily, then I would help out with the things that needed to be done. "
697,"I wish he had answered this because it's really hard to tell if he he is just saying ""Honey, you NEED to get therapy"" or ""Honey, this is absolutely wrong.  You cannot interfere in every aspect of our daughters personal life because it is creating immense social distress.  If you honestly can't see how that is even possible, then I will demand that we seek family counseling because I refuse to allow your behavior to continuing affecting our child"".

&amp;#x200B;

I certainly home he has said something very much like the latter."
698,"I think batch cooking is a great idea.    I once had roomates that would cook strong food and burn food all of the time. It effected my sleep and made me hate being home.   She should be consoderate of her roomate and limit the times she cooks strong foods. Honestly, it is very rude of OP not to compromise. "
699,"She sounds pretty lazy and you seem to let her get away with it. Your rental agreement is a mess, I mean 150 for rent isn't anything she's going to find anywhere without having like 5 roommates. I kind of feel like you didn't set up good enough groundrules prior to moving in. 

I think you need to tell her how you feel, no matter how rough a conversation it is. Make sure she knows you're serious, but that you love her and want her to work harder for herself, too."
700,"I'm super glad that you're helping her. A 47 year old man dating an 18 year old is an abusive predator and there's no way around that. 

Your mom will still be 'replaced' even after this girl is gone because your dad will seek out another young girl to victimize, so don't do it for that reason.

Do know that doing this will probably end your relationship with your father."
701,"These aren't red flags, dude, someone got a hundred yards square of crimson fabric and literally wrapped you up in it.

LEAVE. What possible alternative advice is there?! Except the additional, which is: 1. break up with her in a public place, 2. block her on everything/switch your phone number asap, 3. make records with dates, times, details, preferably photos +/ screenshots of any attempt she makes to contact you, and 4. take those records to the cops if necessary."
702,"I'd respectfully disagree here.   
A fire is a very hypothetical concern, but in this scenario her roommate being violent is a very real concern. Tackle the problem at hand before concerning yourself with uncommon hypothetical situations."
703,"Lol, some people love to go for the nuclear option at the drop of a hat. This OP hasn't even said a damn word about her concern to her own husband, never mind his parents, and never mind there could just be some innocuous cultural reason for this naming thing. It is utterly bonkers to limit contact with close family over such a minor issue, particularly when it hasn't even been discussed yet. Good lord. "
704,"If you've never been to his house he's either a) still with his wife, or b) really not interested in making you a real part of his life. 

He sounds like an utter arshole. You deserve better."
705,"Well, cheaters are liars."
706,"To this point though, I suggest making a fairly small change at first.

You know you'd like to make a change and take on a new challenge. Awesome. You are probably not exactly sure what you'd like that new challenge to be yet, right?

So maybe don't drop everything and immediately pick up a full time job, for example. It would be harder to make a gigantic change that requires both of you to overhaul your daily lives, then discover it wasn't quite right for you, and have to try again, than it would be to make a small change at first.

Pick up a part time job, 10 hours per week or so, or try some volunteer work in a field that appeals to you. If that works, consider taking a class or two. If that works, an associate's degree and/or a moderate, 20-hour per week type job. If that woks, go full time. Small steps will let you test the waters of what you enjoy, recalibrate if you haven't found the right fit, and let your husband adapt to picking up more of the housework incrementally.

Best wishes. You sound like a great pair of people, and I think it's remarkable that you were able to find someone to be this lasting a degree of happy with when you were barely a legal adult. It's totally reasonable to make adjustments; even at 24 you have a lot of maturing still ahead, and that's ok!

&amp;#x200B;"
707,"Exactly.  Not only is what he doing illegal in many jurisdictions, your BF will likely be pissed as the rest of us.

Hang in there."
708,"“No.” is a complete sentence. Hell, you don’t even owe them that.  Just leave the group. "
709,"I mean. Objectively, sure, it’s a little odd to read about, but it’s a practice that I’ve heard/read about before. 

That being said, if you’re truly okay with her objectifying you (which she is) &amp; fattening you up as means to satisfy her kink (which I guess is feeding you in addition to visibly seeing you gain the weight) then go wild. 

However I will caution that this also sounds like it could lead into some weird power play dynamic that you might not be bargaining for. Not that your girlfriend has ulterior motives, BUT, it could get nasty one day &amp; she could turn around the weight gain on you , i.e. “no one will love you except me because you’re so fat” etc. just something to think about.  "
710,"Yes, i found out over time they were super toxic. Sometimes its hard to let go becuase she and i have been friends since middle school, but shit happens. 

We do have a social life that involves mostly other couples amd a few single nerdy guys from work/d&amp;d. 

He and i have old friends we play games with together online, my old WoW guild from 14 years ago (lol) and his ps4 clan. My mom doesnt consider online people friends but she can suck it on that, we meet up once a year with some of them for conventions and its really great. 

Also, my mom kind of gets a bit of a free pass in my eyes, shes jaded for good reason. My bio dad is a scum bag, they were married for 9 years before she found out about his plethora of affairs. She only wants the best for me, and her judgemental crap is just and extention of her anxiety. All on all shes a great mom and i love her, she just pisses me off sometimes. "

712,"""Hey, while I don't mind not getting a present, I'm hurt that you said you'd get me one after you got paid but instead spent your money on X, Y, and Z. Like I said, not getting me a present isn't that big of a deal for me. But, saying that you'd do it but then not doing it really hurt my feelings."""
713,Does she photoshop pictures of herself too?
714,"This. As I was reading I was actually gasping loud, like what the hell? This is a horrible boyfriend. How does he not see what he did is cruel and inconsiderate? "
715,"I'd beam through the whole thing. ""Yessir, I paid for the entire thing. It was my honor to help a child in need."" "
716,"Regarding kids: if your parents are not raising, supporting or making your kids, they do not need to be involved in the decision making process about having them. Don't tell your parents your girlfriend doesn't want kids. "
717,"&gt; He basically has it in his head that all girls go ""girls gone wild"" when on vacation together

He is way too old for this nonsense.

&gt;  Also, my boyfriend has always had trust issues and I have honestly not gone places before just to avoid reactions like this.

Girl why are you with someone who doesn't trust you and inhibits your life over his own issues? Yes, I have been with someone like this and he ruined many nights for me with his controlling attitude. I only lasted a year before his jealousy drove me away. I don't know how you've done it for five and a half."
718,"You say she's only 21 and has already had breast enlargement and other ""work done"". It sounds like she's very unsure about herself - she sees that you're looking good as a result of your own hard work and that knocks her confidence even more.

Just smile and say nothing to her. She'll soon find another foil for her insecurities."
719,I find people who tend to marry after a short amount of time is because theyre super insecure. 
720,"For a start you have to tell your sister. 

&gt;I’m so confused and have no idea what to do anymore.

You dump him. The dude tried to fuck you while he was hot from your sisters pics. Think about that. He only wanted to have sex with you because he used your sister to get his dick up.
"
721,"He calls you names because he has zero respect for you.  

Break up with him. He is abusive and he is not going to change. "
722,Look man. You either figure out if she likes you too or you keep wondering and regretting you never tried when she gets with someone else. But you do you. 
723,"It is certainly understandable that you would like to start spending major holidays together. May I ask what his reason is for wanting to spend the holidays separately?

You can consider sharing your feelings with him in a non-accusatory way. Something like ""I felt sad when you said you didn't want to celebrate Christmas together, because for me spending Christmas together indicates that we are progressing in the relationship. Can you help me understand your thought process? Why do you prefer to spend Christmas apart?""

Keep an open mind. His reasons for wanting to spend Christmas apart may be unrelated to his feelings for you, and he may not have realized that you would link his response to the health of the relationship. "
724,"Why are you thinking about having dinners with your sister right now? What she did was absolutely vile and disgusting. He would be well within his rights not to want to have dinner with her now. He may not ever want to be around her again. I know I wouldn’t want to be around someone who stole nudes of me and was an all around creeper.

Tell your boyfriend. And encourage your sister to seek therapy. This is predatory behavior."
725,"Ever LDR needs an end date. Some achievable goal or plan. Otherwise doesn't seem like there is one here. Four years long distance is a LONG time. 4 years of commitment, missed opportunity, and logistics. Has he mentioned you going to meet him where he lives? Is this a point of contention between the two of you?"
726,"Yeah, I was already on OP's side after reading her post, but she left a lot of info in the comments that make me even more on OP's side that should be included in the original post.  IE:  OP's ""best friend"" hard times is because she knowingly slept with a married man while she was with someone else and OP has a social life with other couples as well per this comment.  


It sounds like OP is just outgrowing her old friendships.  I have done the same, especially with people who do nothing but party &amp; do drugs.  After a while, that shit just gets old and I stopped hanging out with them.  It's normal, from the way her ""friends"" talk about her and say shit like ""thank god she's infertile"", I'd say just cut ties now and move on with life.  I'd also argue to minimize contact with her cruel mother as well."
727,"Brit here, with some knowledge of how this kind of thing works. It's very possible your uncle only holds financial guardianship for your gran - if she's not been deemed incapable of making care decisions for herself (a formal process, involving a doctor) she is in reality entitled to go where she wants. The fact that you say your gran hasn't got dementia suggests that this may be the case.

In any case, the whole point of guardianship is that the vulnerable person's best interests are always paramount. It's quite clear from what you say that this isn't the case for your gran.

If your father wants gran to come and live in Ireland, and if she also wants to come, I can't see any reason why this shouldn't happen. Living in a loving family home is better than being in residential care, as long as you have enough folk there who can help out. 

I suggest your dad (when he feels well enough) contacts Adult Social Services in the area where your gran is living, and asks to speak to someone from the Safeguarding team. The whole issue needs to be unpicked, with gran at the centre of the decision-making process.

Good luck, I really hope you get a good resolution for gran and yourselves."
728,"I just really want to mention that if she were really a narcissist, this would have been their whole life and the husband wouldn’t be posting here he would most likely be either enabling her or also a narcissist. 

I mean she’s definitely being a little crazy and exhibiting similar characteristics and I hope she gets help, but it sounds like a temporary behavior that is resolvable in the end.

I’m not trying to be nit picky, it just is hard if you have actually lived through parents with serious disorders/issues like that. Saying OPs wife might be a narcissist really downplays how abusive true narcissism is. "
729,"I’ve been very supportive of my kids, but it’s had the opposite effect where now my wife thinks we’re teaming up against her and that it’s so unfair that the kids are close to me now when she was the SAHM that did most of the child raising. 

It’s near impossible to get through to her, because now our daughter makes a beeline for me every time she gets home and wife will fume about it for hours. Then she doubles down on the overbearing parenting to force daughter back which causes our daughter to pull away even more. It’s a terrible cycle.

I’ve tried explaining this to her but she just doesn’t see where she could be wrong. Like she’s in 100% denial over how her parenting isn’t the best."
730,"Maybe ask socratic questions about her parenting style? Like, ""In your opinion, at what age will our daughter be old enough to be at a sleepover by herself?"" and ""What sorts of things do you want to do with your life when the kids all move out for college/their own lives?"" These questions about the longer term might help lead her to understand that parenting must change as children change.

Also this could just get her to blow up at you, so hey, take my advice at your own risk. She seems deep deep in denial and I don't envy you at all."
731,"Remaining friends doesn’t mean you have to engage with her the same way you used to. You don’t have to see her one on one, you don’t have to send texts or snaps. You can remain cordial, polite, even friendly, but not be emotionally open or in constant contact. Just.... be less available. She has a boyfriend; she doesn’t need emotional support from you. Just distance yourself."
732,"I’m very disturbed that your priority in all of this is your brother’s grades and not *his mental and possibly physical wellbeing*. If your brother is living with his abuser, how do you know he’s not *still* being abused. Why aren’t you protecting him? Seriously, I’d really like to know why the grades are your priority here. "
733,"Well you've kind of given him an easy way out. You've said ""Just don't do it next time"". His reply is then ""Ok"".


You should ask why he felt a need to and work out what the issue is here. "
734,"Men and women can be friends, but let's be real, if that mode allowed cross-gender discovery no women would use it because men would be constantly harassing them for sex."
735,"Yes, this seems very sensible."
736,"This is what I was thinking as well. Instead of talk about quitting, talk about finding a nicer job. "
737,"He wants you to fill the ""lawyer's wife"" role....not the ""intimately connected true partners"" role.  His love bombing was the first indication, bragging to others was another, tbe tifannys gift was blatant.  

Think about it...he put more effort into talking up his ""taken by a girl"" status to others than he did into bonding with the actual girl!  He doesn't see you for you, he just sees the role you can play in his life as an accessory.  You will be deeply unsatisfied if you stay with him.  "
738,"The fact that he was lying to his girlfriend at the time about hanging with other girls says it all. He had four years to make a move, only chose to now that you’re happy with another guy. 

Don’t ruin the good thing you have going for someone who’s dishonest, selfish, and disrespectful towards your relationship. Tell him if he can’t handle being just friends then he should leave you alone"

741,"&gt;He grabbed my phone and threw it hard against the wall (chipped the paint on the wall and cracked my phone screen), and then hit me (not too hard) on the top of my head with his phone.

Leave. Immediately. Grab all of your important papers and go. File a police report if you feel so inclined - it will help you get a restraining order later if you need one.

You are being physically and emotionally abused. You absolutely should not stay in this situation."
742,"I would be worried about her uneeded ER visits. However, I would be far far far more concerned about the fact that you are headed to marriage and she has hid a $20k expense from you, while criticizing your student loans (an expense that actually increases your earning potential). If your fiancee is hiding expenses from you, I would be conservative about actually marrying without going over her finances. "
743,OP you need to stop re-paying other people's debts. They are all adults. It is time for them to take charge of their own finances. 
744,Move on. She cheated on you only 3 months in and you have no reason to ever trust this woman again. Being single for 6 years is a pretty shitty excuse for staying with this shitty person. 
745,"OP, I am a stealth trans guy and I would ditch anyone who outed me.  They betrayed your trust in a way that they don't truly understand because cis people never really do, and continue to do so.  My privacy is super important to me and I would feel similarly crushed.  Do yourself a favor and drop them, because I highly doubt they will stop doing this either way.  Find some support among other trans people if possible."

749,"I would want to stuff him in a closet. Why are you dating a thirteen-year-old? And yes, I know it says he's 23 but come on. 

And he's telling you that you don't have the right to be annoyed by him. THAT is a bit worrisome.
"
750,"I guess from his perspective, it could be that because you don’t think her cheating is a big deal, he feels you can do it to him as well. Since you find it as “no big deal”.

So I guess maybe communicate to him and clarify your personal stance on it, as opposed to saying it’s no big deal, period.

Apologizing for giving your opinion? No. But maybe apologize for not being clear and the misunderstanding between you two.

More often than not, your view on one thing is seen as consistent. So it’s not entirely wrong for him to be raise an eyebrow, but at the same time, he shouldn’t jump to a conclusion that you are ok with cheating. But that is the way of the human mind sometimes."
751,"You don’t proceed. He is an adult and can make his own decisions. Leave it alone, it’s none of your business. "
752,"The guy who said it was definitely hitting on me. 

I had to tell him fucking fast wasn’t a good thing. "
753,"Dump the girlfriend, keep the gay friend. "
754,"This isn't The Big Sick. It sounds incredibly fishy, especially with a cousin who is super aggressive to get you out of the picture. Either this is all a lie, which means both your gf and her family have some crazy baggage, or it's true and there's nothing you can do about it, other than removing yourself from the equation until she wakes up."

756,"This sounds to me like a system ripe for opportunity for your sister to ""skim off the top"". It's no wonder she wants you to contribute straight cash. Is there ever an accounting of the gifts?

Don't fall for any of this. You are not greedy (in fact quite the opposite) for living within your means and buying gifts that both fit your budget and you have personally chosen and purchased.

If your family doesn't like it, tough. . ."
757,"One of the main reasons I stopped at my MA and didn't go for the PhD. If you're moving to the DC area, depending on what her field of study is, there's probably a think tank that would take her on considering her background. She'd have to work her way up the ladder but that's true of any job. If she's willing to broaden her horizons there's plenty of work in that area she should be able to find. She can continue applying for university positions in the hopes something will pan out, but she shouldn't bet everything on that."
758,This feels similar to my experience and perspective. I think we may try finding a couple's counselor soon to help us communicate about some other issues. I'll add this to the docket.
759,How did you type that all out and not realize you have to leave him?
760,"Let him ""live his life"" long-distance with his new girlfriend, because he sure as hell isn't treating you like a girlfriend. "
761,"Give your daughter space. By you pushing and texting and emailing, you're making things worse. She's an adult, making an adult decision for herself, and she doesn't need mom trying to fix it for her. She clearly wants to deal with her hurt feelings about all this, and you being around to share your side isn't going to help. Right now, your side doesn't matter. She needs to deal with her resentments and decide when she's ready to discuss it with you.

Yes, she should be in therapy and not being on meds probably is making things more difficult, but right now this is her show. "
762,Stop trying to be cool and tell your boyfriend the truth: you aren't comfortable with it and the fact that he would even consider it is a warning flag.
763,This! I feel for the sister. OP says she doesn't care about a big elaborate wedding but is completely ignoring how important it is to her sis. I hope after both tempers cool they can reach a compromise and still be a part of each other's day.
764,"Thanks, I think I just wanted to vent my frustration. It's not the first time he's done this. I really limit any communication with him. He's a really negative person. He's a bit racist but I think he dislikes everyone. Probably comes from within if you ask me. He's so miserable that he feels like he needs to drag everyone else down to his private Hell. 

I've tried to be understanding but in the last several years I've completely detached emotionally from him. He told me tonight that he wished his kids would never come home. That's fine, but I worry about our mum. "
765,"I'm the kid of a dad who your boyfriend scarily reminds me of. He and my mom's relationship had more passion than yours at the beginning, as she told me, but after the first few years it was all law school all the time. Even the strict schedule and placating her with gifts whenever she expressed wanting more time/affection. Then the wife, house, kids boxes all got checked like clockwork. 20 years later they divorced because he admitted he hadn't been in love with her for years. Once self-employed he'd work till ridiculous hours (10pm-midnight) partly to avoid having to be at home.

This guy's already married to his future career and you're the side chick. There's nothing wrong with having that as his priority, but it really sounds like he sees you as just a prop in the life he's aiming for where it's expected that a successful lawyer will have a nice wife and home etc. If you're not satisfied with that then you know what to do."
766,"The idea that someone simply doesn't give enough of a damn about someone else to even entertain the discussion is fucking scary. I think that's why people go to ""I just have to find the right way to say it"" rather than accept that the other person knows, has heard, and doesn't give a flying fuck. Because it means that there is no point in continuing. "
767,"&gt; It's already pretty difficult for us to hangout because of schedule conflicts

What happens when he isn’t around? Are you eating well and exercising?"
768,"I literally can't stand him. Making her stay late alone with the mom while he ""meets an old friend""!!!! "
769,"&gt; Is this a red flag?

Yes. He's disrespecting you, and continues to do it after you point it out.

It's not a 100% automatic dealbreaker or anything, but you need to put your foot down and insist that he stop speaking to you like a child.  Interrupt him when he starts doing it, and **don't apologize for being bothered by it.**

Hopefully he's mature enough to admit his own bad behavior and address it.  If not...well, that might be a dealbreaker."
770,"I came here to say exactly this. I'm a woman and a gamer and the environment in some online spaces can be incredibly toxic and it's often easier to say nothing/play nice than deal with that kind of shit.

OP, has she had any past instances of men being abusive or toxic? Maybe she's been there/done that and would really rather avoid it? You say she doesn't encourage them and indicates she's unavailable, so it seems to me like she's handling these kinds of advances in a ""kill them with kindness"" kind of way.

Edit: have you spoken to her about any of this, btw?"
771,"You can be consistently trustworthy and loving towards her. In terms of the sex, with a background like you describe there is a good chance that she has been made to feel that the only use she is to a man is for his sexual pleasure. Maybe try declining sex and doing something intimate but non-sexual instead, or make some sessions just about her pleasure, to remind her that she as a person matters more to you than what she can give you in bed.

Having said that, trust issues that run this deep are not something you are going to be able to fix for her. You can support her if that's something you both want, but ultimately she's the one who is going to need to do the work, ideally with a professional involved. "
772,"&gt; noodles with cabbage and butter

In the US, this is called haluski/halusky, and is pretty common fare for people with ancestors from various eastern European countries (Poles, Serbs, Ukrainians, etc.). My mom's people are of Rusyn descent, and they make it too.

Actual Poles wouldn't recognize it because it's a second- or third-order approximation of traditional European halusky, where the dumplings have been swapped out for egg noodles, and the sauerkraut used in strapacky (itself a substitute for the cheese in traditional halusky) has been replaced with plain green cabbage. This was probably due to 19th century immigrants not having access to the traditional ingredients and making do with the closest affordable local equivalents."
773,Talk to him outside of trying to initiate anything. Maybe talk about having more regular romantic date nights out too. Just wanting to put more effort into having adventures together and being physically affectionate. It sounds like you've just got caught up in routines at this point. 
774,"How about you take it in baby steps?

Tell your GF that you, as the ""father figure"" (assuming you are the main father figure in his life), would like to spend some bonding time with him and get to know him.

For example, going forward, Sunday afternoons are time for the two of you to hang out. Her son will be with you, who she loves and trusts and can be sure he won't be in any danger.

Begin by taking him out for lunch, and asking him what his interests/passions are, what does he want to do in college? What shows does he like watching? Are there sports he would like to try?

Discuss these interests with your GF. *""Hey, on our man-date the other day, Paul said he's really keen to try karate. I think it'd be a great way for him to learn some self-defense and build some confidence. What do you think if I take him to a class next week?""*

You don't want it to become you and the son vs your GF (i,e don't discuss this or argue with her in front of him), but privately bring this up.  It would be no harm for him to have some breathing space and freedom and someone to advocate for him."
775,"Yeah I'm jumping on this train.  After reading OP statement, and based on having a quiet spouse at times, it just made me want to yell what I always want to yell, but I know it's not helpful:  ""Just say something!  What are you thinking now!?  SAY IT!  Why the fuck aren't you responding when I ask a question!?!?!""  "
776,"&gt; He was upset and asked if I trusted him or not.

This reaction is why you shouldn't trust him. Shady as fuck. If he's unwilling to make your your sexual health is protected, dump him. Do not even CONSIDER agreeing to this. This guy doesn't care about your safety, he only cares about his orgasm. 

&gt; He didnt show signs of backing down. 

Then you should dump him. This is a dealbreaker. You can't trust him, you know that now, so you should NOT have sex with him. At all. Do not risk pregnancy or an STD because this asshole is pressuring you. This could affect the rest of your life. Don't take any chances with someone who isn't willing to do the bare minimum to keep you safe."
777,"Personally, if I had the option, I'd take a nap every day too.  But to me, this sounds like someone who isn't getting ""good"" sleep.

She should probably consider a sleep study.  

*My mother used to fight exhaustion every day even though she was in bed 9 hours a night.  Found out she had sleep apnea.  Once she was on a C-Pap machine, her energy levels quickly returned to those of a normal woman her age.*"
778,"You and this woman are at entirely different points in life. She entered into a sexual relationship with you as an adult while you were still a child. There's no future for you with her, and frankly her behavior so far has been predatory (and likely illegal)."
779,Ugh you're right! What a freak! Who does something like that! I could barf just thinking about it. 
780,"I absolutely agree that I have trouble distinguishing normal boundaries with my parents. I did go to a therapist at one point for a few sessions, but this whole fiasco is making me think I should go back again and check in on myself and remind myself why she was estranged in the first place."
781,"Wow he sounds insufferable.   

You all need to talk about the way he treats you and excessively criticizes you.  

Presumable you look at yourself in the mirror before you go out and you decide that you look fine.  He is second guessing your ability to decide that you look okay.   His comments are petty and uncalled for.  Yes if you have tp coming out of your pants he should tell you.  Other than something like that he should really not comment at all u less you ask for his input. "
782,"Thank you. I'm definitely not someone who just wants the paycheck without a meaningful relationship. I see those relationships 20, 30 years down the line and the spouses live largely separate, cold lives. You're right about looking forward - there's always the next clerkship, biglaw associate hours, partnership lookback, then partnership itself... it doesn't end, and those can easily take #1 on the list of priorities for the rest of one's life."

784,"&gt;I’ve been asked in recent years to contribute up to $300 dollars to help buy our mom and other sister presents.

Wait, I don't understand what is going on...

Who is buying all the presents? For who? You just give... someone... money and presents appear? I don't understand. Do you not do the present shopping for gifts you get your family? Or is someone else doing that for you?

&amp;#x200B;"
785,Maybe it's pride related? I knew a guy in high school who said he'd rather die than let his wife take care of him. 
786,Why do you care about her friendship? She doesn't respect you and she's not aligned with you morally. 
787,"I would say to elope (it seems like you are very passionate about it) and then on your one year anniversary, have a public ceremony for friends and family. That way you can go ahead and be married and then by your anniversary, your sisters wedding will be over and your ceremony can go off (hopefully) without issues."
788,His house is too small and cluttered for his girlfriend but not for two children? That’s not very convincing. 
789,"Leave your mom out of the equation when you turn down his offer. “No thank you” is a complete sentence. You love your current home and have made memories there. You need space to be able to enjoy your marriage and parent your kids, you are not interested in sharing your familial home with /anyone/, not even him. It’s actually a giant red flag on his part that he’d even put this on the table. It’s extemely interfering and presumptuous. You’d be miserable. "
790,That was three years ago. People mature and grow up especially with how young he was when he said it. I think anyone would be offended reading that at first but just remember that you’ve been together for three years so there is no way he thinks of you as ugly.
791,"Again, is your mother allowed a lesser standard of basic human respect just because she birthed you?"
792,"I don't know how you feel about telling an outright lie, but you could tell him that your insurance won't cover a boat at your dock that you don't own, and your insurance company told you to move the boat.  I like to blame insurance companies to get out of sticky situations.  Want to borrow my car?  Ooh, sorry, insurance won't allow that.  You want to swim in my pool whenever you want because we're neighbors?  Sorry, Brenda, but insurance company says no go.  You need me to dogsit your 120 pound furbaby for a week?  Oh gosh, I'm sorry, my insurance policy has a no large dogs clause."
793,Right?! I’m not super confrontation but I’d honestly probably scream at that point. There *had* to be words exchanged right OP?!
794,"""No, we can't cancel our plans.""

What are the chances that, if you did reschedule, the GF wouldn't make it, anyway?   "
795,"I think the three logical options here are either:

&amp;#x200B;

a) She is in the middle of a mental breakdown/mental illness is starting to manifest

&amp;#x200B;

b) She's on drugs

&amp;#x200B;

c) She's a piece of shit bigot 

&amp;#x200B;

Without further information I'm not sure which is the most likely, but none of these would surprise me."
796,"Uh, how can a divorce **not** go through the courts?  You can hypothetically get one without getting lawyers involved, but you still have to file for the divorce in order for it to happen.  Marriage is a legal contract.  Either he filed for divorce, or he didn't get one. "
797,"Jesus Christ dude. Your SON needs therapy. Urgently. Do you think he doesn’t know what happened? I can’t even fathom how traumatic this must be for him. Something beyond horrifying happened in front of him, he probably knows to feel guilty about it, his sister is gone, and his mother doesn’t Iove him or speak to him anymore.

Don’t lose your other child. Take even more care of him and protect him from his mother’s resentment. It wasn’t his fault.

You and your wife are in agony and for that, I am so sorry. But you are adults and have the autonomy to access resources. After your daughter, your son is the second greatest victim of this tragedy, and he is only four."
798,"Try an experiment to improve your empathy levels.  Stay up all night.  Then, in the morning, do your normal work, come home, do your chores, and see how much you prioritize sleep over hanging out with your wife.  

I went through this when I stayed up all night due to my newborn baby, for months on end.  People are amazingly unsympathetic to sleep deprivation, and also amazingly reluctant to try it for themselves.  I got a lot of accusations of “laziness” and somehow, no one wanted to keep me company during the nighttime baby-feedings.

Edited to add: and she's watching a two-year-old in the morning before work?  You're kidding when you say you don't get why she's tired, right?"
799,"&gt; I realized sadly, that the nicest thing I could do for him, is leave him alone. For the rest of his life. Let him be. And not disturb him ever again unless he disturbs me first. Which...I doubt he will.  

First remotely sane thing you've said all day.  

I think you should start treating this like a serious illness. You're sick and this sickness is warping the way you think. Stop treating it as if it's just a regular unrequited love and rejection. **You're a crazed harasser that's been stalking and harassing this guy for years.**  

Can you afford a therapist? "
800,"Not true at all. She was 24 when they got together. The age gap concern is very real. Much older men with poor relationship skills DO seek younger, less experienced women because older women won’t put up with their BS. "
801,"So. Your wife was raped, aborted a fetus, and tried to overdose. She plays games. She plays games with guys. She gets attention from guys she plays with. She politely deflects advances and lets them know that she is in a relationship.

Big sigh.

Your wife is coping, dude. She is self medicating through online interactions and after a really traumatic experience this is probably how she escapes that. Her body was violated. Her space was invaded. Women react to these things differently, but it honestly sounds like this is how she is reclaiming herself. 

If she’s being honest with you and letting you know and showing you conversations that she’s having with these guys she’s playing with, then I think you should be able to trust her. I realize you (understandably) don’t trust them, but trust her. She is probably still dealing with a mountain of pain and insecurity and uncertainty after the horrific thing(s) that happened to her, and if this is what she does or needs to feel good and disconnect from that trauma, then she should be able to do that. 

She isn’t sending them nudes. She isn’t saying anything suggestive back. A joke here and there is kind of just the nature of gaming and the internet. 

It’s good to be a concerned husband and it’s ok to be uncomfortable with things. But communication is really fucking everything, so if you’re feeling jealous, talk to her. Ask her why she sends pictures, if that’s really the root of all your feelings. 

Just trust your wife. Maybe consider counseling? And for fuck’s sake please do not snoop behind her back. Nothing good EVER comes from snooping. 

Signed,

27[F] gamer."
802,"This may be the hill that your marriage will (rightfully) die on. It's your home too and you have every right to have a say in who gets to live with you and for how long. Honestly, at this point, I think you guys need couples counseling. "
803,You ignored every possible red flag and went on to have 2 kids with this man. People don't change. What did you think would happen?
804,Not to mention she’s—how do I put this delicately?—a complete asshole.
805,"I think it's the timing thats tricky. Had she done this a year or two after his death I could see it being a nice tribute to him. It's now ten years later and while I could see getting the rose design done being a good idea, including the name and years seems a bit different. It's in a prominent place so you won't be able to forget it's there.

The part at play is how does this affect you? Yes of course it's her body and she can do whatever she wants to it, but there are consequences from our actions. Perhaps delve into why you are uncomfortable with it. If you feel it's a bad thing to do, why? What reasons would you have for not getting it done on yourself? Are those reasons in any way applicable to how she feels? Do you feel that her choosing to do this demonstrates something about her personality that might be an Incompatiblity with yours? Do you feel weird about her being close with the family? It might be your own insecurities coming out. "

OH MY LORD this is the best thing I've seen today. Can you get your hands on it?? 

Therapy sounds smart &amp; healthy, good for you! Smashing it!"
807,"as another woman that games, nothing stops thirsty guys from trying anyway. Plenty know I am taken, but still say nasty things because they are nasty people who have no respect for boundaries."
808,"That new 1975 album is incredible.
Tell her she needs to chill and that there’s no need to do a brief (or in this case, obsessively thorough) inquiry into online relationships "
809,"Wait so your dad taunted you into doing exactly what he wanted you to do? You just reinforced his behavior! people like this don’t feel ashamed for their actions, they only see results and you did literally what he wanted you to do. If you really didn’t want to sink to his level you would have bounced and not come back until he apologized "
810,"\&gt; The kids are also technically part of the friend circle and wouldn’t be ok with being sent to a room to watch a movie while the adults hang out. Which is fair cause how can you tell a kid that they can’t be apart of the board game and Christmas craft party?

&amp;#x200B;

It's not fair. Kids are not friends with adults. You tell a kid that they have certain crafts they can do that are just-for-kids, and they have kid games in the game room, but it's an adult party and the adults are hanging out right now. They can go watch a movie, bye. 

I have 2 kids. This is what I do when we bring them to social outings--however I would never bring my kids if no one else had kids?? That's weird as fuck. When we bring our kids to things, we kick them out of the adult party and tell them to go away. We have games or activities for them sometimes. 

Next time you throw a party, make sure to specify it's an adult gathering. Kids don't need to be around alcohol and bad language which happens when I get together with my friends. You are completely within your rights to not want 2 unruly children ruining and damaging your home. ""So-And-So invites you to a board game party! Where, When, details! Reminder that this is an adults-only get together as there will be alcohol and festive language!"" 

I dunno that's all I got. I've been invited to plenty of things that were specified as adult only."
811,"Get out, but rent first. Buying a home costs a ton of money, even with first homebuyer loans that let you put less money down. Closing costs are thousands of dollars, you'll need furniture and other things, you may need to do some repairs (what happens if your furnace or water heater break a few months in, etc). And you don't want to rush into the purchase because you need to get out of your relationship situation. $5k is not enough to have in savings to buy a home. And it really ties you down to your location. It can also take a lot of time to find a house that works for you, then more time for the closing (at least a month, and that's if it goes smoothly). 

Look for an apartment, preferably one that makes you buzz people in. If you're worried for your safety, can your parents loan you money for a security deposit so you can get out sooner? You could also look for a roommate situation, or sublease so you can have cheaper rent and get out faster. "
812,"Stuff like that happened with a family member who was in the beginning stages of early onset Alzheimer’s - inappropriate sexual aggression wasn’t uncommon. 

Your friend’s father may just be an asshole but sometimes when things like this happen unexpectedly there could be other factors involved besides alcohol.

Not by any means downplaying or excusing his lewd behavior - it is wrong regardless but worth looking into a little deeper. "
813,"Did it really never occur to you that most future partners would have a problem with the fact that you’re still living with your EX of a year by choice?  It’s not like you broke up, are stuck with the lease but looking to move out when it’s over. You broke up, ended one lease, and then chose to re-sign the lease and continue living with her, potentially indefinitely. Some people are uncomfortable with their SO being close friends with an EX, *choosing* to live with one is a line that most people wouldn’t tolerate. 

Come on. You 100% knew how much of a potential dealbreaker this would be to most people because you lied to your GF about your living situation. 

If you want this relationship to have a chance (or to avoid torpedoing potential future ones) then you need to move out. "
814,Best case scenario is that the fiance realizes your sister is a nutbag and heads for the hills. 
815,"She is mad because you didn’t protect her as a child.

As an adult she is now reworking through everything that happened with life experience of being independent.   She may not agree with your choice to stay.  

Part of your decision to raise children within an abusive situation means that your relationship with your children was hurt.  This will likely also come up again if she ever chooses to have children of her own.  

The most you can do is be patient.  You patiently choose to stay with someone abusive and now you’re going to need to give your daughter the same patience. "

817,"You haven't been following no contact if you are having 2 hour long conversations.

818,"Agree w this^. I feel you OP. As someone who was bullied in high school, the thought of being near those girls now - even knowing they could have matured, even knowing it could have come from their own insecurities, even knowing it might have all been dumb juvenile stuff - makes me sick to my stomach. I know it completely sucks and is unfair, but maybe everything happens for a reason? Whether you stay or find a new volunteer position, I wish you all the best. "

I was actually thinking this too.  It's full of all the teenage fantasies about love.   And the BF sounds like an immature  asshole.   

The OP definitely has to have a sit down with her boyfriend and tell him what was said and how she feels."
823,"That's the question I was going to ask. 
"
824,"In the future you need to....?

He just presumes he gets to explode like that and have a future with you?

You’re certainly welcome to spend however much time you need looking for an excuse for his behavior and justifying it and/or his actions. If it were me, I’d be packing my bags right now. I have a zero tolerance policy for intentionally inflicting harm. 

He intentionally threw a phone. He intentionally hit you. He never hit you or damaged your property before? Has he ever spoken to you in those sorts of ways before? I bet he’s done them and you’ve rationalized it. This is typically an escalating behavior. It won’t get better. His treatment of you will only get worse. "
825,"I gotta tell you, you seemed to have communicated you're feelings in a reasonable way. Why is it your job to fix this?

Do you really want to date someone who can't take feedback, is prone to using physical aggression when frustrated, and that can't express themselves in a respectful manner?

I would have peaced out a long time ago."
826,I recommend farting in front of her to test the waters before spending 9 days together.
827,"Also he said he couldn't text her back because he phone was on charge the other end of the room?  In a restaurant? So he left his phone charging in a place full of strangers where he couldn't keep an eye on it. Cafes and restaurants are well known for people having their phones stolen from right next to them on the table.

Also he invited her,  told her the location but didn't tell her he changed the location or kept an eye on his phone to see if she was able to leave work to catch up with them later.

It sounds like a made up excuse. "
828,"You need to be honest and direct with her, in a civil way. Tell her that you value her friendship, but you are struggling with anxiety and depression, and can’t handle a one way venting situation. Ask her if you can help her find a therapist to vent with. Tell her that you and your partner are going to start trying for kids soon. Just because she has a diagnosis code doesn’t mean she has a free pass to be a jerk... it’s okay to tell her that her behavior is bothering you."
829,Could just as likely be the people who brought the kid back... no way to trace it back to her

He should have told you he put you on speaker, he should be worried about having embarrassed you. He is placing his own awkwardness at a higher value than your feelings and making you feel like that is your fault. It is not, you did nothing wrong, he did.

Your feelings are totally valid here, you are right to be hurt by his actions in this."

843,"You don't owe anybody a relationship. Ever. 

Parents who want their children to visit have to make it not actively unpleasant to do so. If every time you spend time with your dad and his wife you get yelled at and insulted, then the obvious and natural result of that is that you will stop going to an effort to spend time with them. That's not something you did, that's something they did. 

I do however recommend that you *actually tell them that*. Don't just make vague excuses and not tell them your plans and let them be confused and upset. Say, explicitly, using words, ""Sorry, dad, but every time I visit you, you and Stepmom are really rude to me about my life choices and I'm not interested in subjecting myself or my girlfriend to that, so we won't be visiting."" If they actually apologize in response to that and promise to do better, consider trying to mend fences and seeing if they're able to act like adults, but if they just pitch a tantrum about how you're a terrible child who is supposed to Respect Your Elders? Fuck 'em. "

You want to have the option of calmly saying, if you can't fucking stop then I'm going to leave...and then leave.  Every time.  It takes two to fight, so don't fight.  Just calmly, rationally leave.  Or end the phone call, or stop responding AND READING the text.  "

851,"Invoke the baby card with your wife. It's not a ploy; it's the bottom line. You are trying to protect your primary family, which means her and the baby. That's a sacred duty. Say you know if the situation were reversed, she would feel the same way and would try to protect you, too. Her sister is a blind spot, but you can't allow that huge and damaging a blind spot to jeopardize what should be the most special time of your lives together. Also, take it from one recent new mom: she will be emotional af the first couple weeks. Hormones going crazy. Happy tears, sad tears, I-don't-know-why tears. Throw a cruel sister into that situation and she could very well say something that deeply damages your wife, potentially with lasting effects (like postpartum depression, which is different from the initial ""baby blues""--look it up for more info). Her emotional and physical health, and that of the baby's, needs to come first. Good luck."

854,"\&gt; They don't get it.

OP, I'm an old dinosaur -- 40 -- and literally the first question out of my mouth when a young person came out to me earlier this year was: ""Is there anyone you don't want me to tell?""

Like, that's common sense. Not everyone will be supportive, but let's be clear: supportive people will always figure out the boundaries that you need to feel safe.

That your friends have failed on this most basic step leads me to believe that they are not ""safe"" people. Adjust your friendship with them accordingly. Not everyone can be trusted to the same degree, and this situation underlines that truism."

856,"Let your boyfriend *and* the cops know right away--this guy sounds terrifying. Your boyfriend will want to support you through this. I get not wanting to let him in on it, but it sounds like this guy is pretty persistent. It's likely to come out somehow. 

But rest assured you did nothing wrong in any of this, and you do *not* deserve to be treated the way this jerk is treating you. You need to involve people who can be there for you if this guy gets worse before he gets better (Sorry if that sounds scary--he *is* scary!)."

858,"... you had IVF to have a child with this loser???? Like you went out of your way to have kids with him????

Op, what were you thinking? There’s a reason a 27 year old was interested in a 17 year old! And it’s probably because your maturity levels matched back then.

What should you do? Break it off and move back home. That’s about all I can think of. Find a way to support yourself and your kids because this dude is never going to do that."
859,"&gt;Boss: [gives me a weird look] ""Yeah, but how?""

""Its just a precaution. Once I know more and how it'll impact work, I'll let you know. I appreciate the concern.""

&gt;I genuinely feel like my career here would suffer if I were to say that I wasn't comfortable sharing.

""I like to think of work as a way to get away from all the medical drama. You can understand how exhausting it can be to explain these things again and again, especially when you have no updates.""

""When i get anything concrete, I will let you know. For now I don't want to worry anyone needlessly.""

Then ask them a personal question. A basic ""how are *you* doing/what's new with you"" should do the trick. People *love* talking about themselves so if you can shift the focus off you onto them, it'll help. If you can, try to find individual personal things to talk about. If Karen does crafts, ask how her projects are going. If your boss does marathons, ask her about her next one and what she does for training. General friendly inquiries that should keep them talking and generally make you personable. 

Ultimately if they keep pushing, you should tell them how uncomfortable this is making you. How it feels unprofessional even though you understand it comes from a place of concern. Whatever the fallout may be from that, *you are not being unreasonable*. This could open them up for an HR issue and possibly a lawsuit if they keep pushing. Depends on the state and the department of labour says."

861,"Sweetheart, you’re already alone in this relationship. It’s an abusive one. It will only escalate until he hurts you or the baby. 

Leave him. Get free of him and decide what you want to do with the pregnancy. If it were me, so early on... I’d abort so you never have to see this man again. "

863,"My parents died before I became a teenager, and my legal guardians sound a lot like your parents. They were not interested in being loving or engaged parents, but rather just going through the motions and milestones to get me to a functional adult stage. It was painful for a time, but it made me who I am -- stronger and better for it. 

I also think it's true that everyone has two families -- the one you get, and the one you choose. You'll find people you care about, and who care about you, and you can develop a strong, nurturing, healthy support network that you can rely on when your parents aren't meeting your needs. "
864,"Holy shit.. Why are you still in this marriage?

####You. Are. Afraid. Of. Your. Husband.

This is not a healthy relationship. You can’t talk to him about your feelings and what you need from your partner. The emotional connection has been so badly damaged it’s almost nonexistent. You don’t trust him and are fearful of his reactions to what you say!

You’re in a abusive relationship OP. You know you can’t go on living this way. He needs to fix *himself* — there is nothing you can do to make him a better person. None of this is fair to you. It’s time to leave him. Move in a close friend or family member and contact a divorce attorney."
865,That's really strange to just go on a trip on the day of. How did he coordinate time off work etc. if it was that last minute? He also didn't even try and include you knowing you would have been potentially interested since you discussed it prior. I think you should take some time and write out what your expectations are moving forward so you can come into the conversation and articulate what about the situation hurt you.

867,"4 year old, 2 year old, and she's pregnant.
So the last four-five years she's been pregnant/breastfeeding, and she's pregnant again, so probably isn't feeling great. She's also almost certainly touched out by the kids.

And you have recently diagnosed ADHD...so how was that manifesting? If you're typical, it's probably through housework, bill paying, messiness, forgetfulness. (I personally have ADHD.) So how much of the parenting/household stuff is she picking up compared to you? What did this look like in the past? And be perfectly honest! 

You're over there buying lingerie when really your wife would probably rather come home to a clean house, bills and chores all done, and a father who was fully involved with the kids, giving her a chance to relax and put her feet up. This means doing all of this without her asking you.  "

This is why this woman is ""friends"" with you. 

She is able to manipulate you by verbally assaulting you and because of your low self esteem/weak sense of self, you go along with it.

There's no way to make her understand -- she's a toxic leech of a human being. "
870,"You implied in your post that you drink so much you don't actually remember what you do in that state and have to rely on what other people tell you that you did.

873,"Only you can decide how important this is to you.   I wouldn't consider it unreasonable to treat this as a dealbreaker - or to look past it and move on.  If she believed this her whole life but didn't tell you, you might have been none the wiser.

Having said that, I was in a serious relationship with a woman who had a lot of beliefs that I wrote off - during the honeymoon period - as quirky and harmless.  Mostly supernatural things, like placing a lot of actual weight in horoscopes and astrology, believing she'd been spoken to by dead relatives. Aliens. Things like that. She had visited fortune tellers in the past, and believed them.

These things didn't, for the most part, affect me directly.  But as time went on, the more I saw of her sincere belief in these things, and the more we talked about them, it contributed (heavily, but not exclusively) to a general erosion of my respect for her.  The willingness to believe fantastic claims without evidence (or with affirmative evidence that the ideas are false) made it hard for me trust anything she said.  And she picked up on that, which as you can imagine was awful for the relationship.

So my advice is to think about this long and hard.  By itself, it's a strange but basically harmless idea.  The fact that you're posing this question here, however, suggests to me that this is a significant concern for you.  When the honeymoon period is over, how will you feel about being with someone who is willing to believe ideas that you neither agree with, nor see any reasonable way to agree with?  Will the same thinking that led her to believe this idea, be a problem in other contexts?  Will it interfere with your ability to trust and respect her?

These *could* be dealbreakers, and reasonably so.  They need not be for everyone, but they may be for you.  Especially if it's indicative of how she approaches truth and belief in other contexts."
874,"I work in hotels. Try and contact the hotel directly and explain that you reserved the wrong date, you wanted to surprise your partner and it turns out her schedule changed. Ask them if it would be possible to modify the date of the reservation, and that you would be prepared to pay a fee if the rate is different on the date you would prefer. I hope that you reserved via the hotel directly but even if you didn’t you can give it a shot."
