0,"&gt; 3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down.

Jesus christ kudos for having that kind of outlook on things."
1,"Why don’t you ask her why you didn’t get an invite? If you thought of her as one of your close friends, seems like it would be worth the effort."
2,Your dad wouldn't even let you sleep in his house after your mom passed and your worried about not letting him go to a show? Tell him to piss off.
3,Don't go to therapy with an abuser. Go to a divorce lawyer without them.
4,"Thank you for saying that, it means a lot. I just remember drama from my own wedding that soured a couple of relationships and memories, and I don't want to do that to someone else."
5,"I would just leave this alone if I were you. As you seem to know, every relationship is different, as is every individual and their boundaries. It’s Alex’s job to know his SO and the boundaries of their relationship- what would and wouldn’t be okay. If you did the courteousy of asking and he said it was fine, I wouldn’t press beyond that. If he’s lying, that’s his and his gf problem not yours, and if he’s telling the truth and you make 20 questions of it it’ll look like you have alterier motives.

Just go camping and have fun!"
6,"Based on my understanding of events:

* He asked for an unspecified “snack”, so you brought him a snack. 
* He ate the snack without complaint. 
* He then proceeded to whine and complain the rest of his evening about his stomach hurting, then repeatedly lied to you by insisting that he wasn’t still hungry. 
* He later pouted that you didn’t read his mind and magically know that he actually wanted a turkey burger and not a pastry (which he had eaten without complaint). 
* The next morning he woke up before you and saw you sleeping peacefully next to him. 
* He then got up, grabbed a glass of water, then vindictively poured it over his deeply asleep GF to punish her for not reading his mind the night before, laughing while he did so

Girl if anything you are massively underreacting. How did you not insta-dump his ass the moment he poured water on you?? That was so insanely disrespectful and cruel. 

Luckily it looks like the trash took itself out, make sure he has all his stuff then make the break permanent. Block him everywhere and move on."
7,"Holy shit what the fuck? Your mom sounds ignorant, your ex and sister are both fuckwads, and anyone supporting that relationship should not be your friend. You sister, who should be one of your best friends, was the girl your ex cheated on you with. 
Don't go. Don't ever speak to them again, and if any of your family has a problem with that you can cut them out."
8,"&gt; then got angry I'm ""not working to unlearn biases and he is"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Says the dude loudly proclaiming no one speaks english in Paris"
9,"There was an Ask Men reddit a bit ago about something like ‘Men who broke up with a great girl to play the field - How did it go?’ 

For the most part they regretted it. They quickly found out that sex doesn’t just grow on trees and having a new woman in bed every night just doesn’t happen. At lot of them also said they realised sex with strangers was no where near as good as with someone who loved them and they missed the rest of the intimate parts that make up a relationship. 

I’m not suggesting you tell him any of this or warn him, he won’t listen anyway. I am suggesting you let him go because he has clearly made up his mind already and the whole ‘do you want me to cheat on you instead’ thing was a pretty shitty move. 

I’m telling you this so you can take some solace in the fact he’s probably going to regret it."
10,"&gt; Should I just let it go

No, absolutely not. Don’t be with someone who doesn’t trust you."
11,Your therapist is 100% right. Your girlfriend is a monster. You are being abused in a half dozen different ways.
12,"i don’t even know why this is a question when you’re in a good, loving relationship. 

if a friend is giving you an ultimatum like this, even more so with the knowledge of your relationship, is he really a friend at all? been there. done that; it sucks but at the end of the day it’s their choice to break it up."
13,"You already got good responses to your original question but I wanted to comment about the ""I gave your mom money to take you to that concert"" comment. When you're broke and an adult money doesn't work like that. Absent dads love to give a small amount of money and say it's for a specific thing and feel that they saved the day. Your mom likely had other necessities or debts she needed to use the money for before taking you to a concert, yet she still found a way to  get you there by busking and creating a fun memory at the same time. It's a beautiful story and your dad's an asshole for trying to say it wasn't necessary because he provided."
14,"Never cosign.  NEVER COSIGN.  **NEVER, EVER COSIGN.**

VA benefits aside, that loan becomes your responsibility and the fact that these people can't get a loan on their own demonstrates that they don't have the credit reponsibility to pay it down.

Not only would you lose your VA loan benefit for a house you wouldn't live in but they could cripple your credit score."
15,"Wow, I’m so very sorry. Your mom sucks. Your sister sucks. Your ex sucks. You are definitely not the one acting irrational here, your mother is. She’s upset at *you* for rightfully wanting nothing to do with this wedding but she’s not upset at *them* for completely stabbing you in the back? Honestly if you can, you should think about moving out as soon as possible, maybe even stay with a friend in the meantime if possible. Your family sounds incredibly toxic and I really am sorry that you have to deal with this."
16,"So he gaslights you, accuses you of lying, delegitimizes your achievement and tries to turn it into something to be wary of taking pride in, and uses the opportunity to have a relationship discussion into putting you on the defensive for wanting to have an adult talk? 

You know that survivors of abuse often find another abuser and recreate those patterns right?"
17,"Good lord, who are all these grown adults giving in to Candy's tantrums? Yes, Candy is a pain in the ass, but the only reason she's getting her way is because your BIL and your wife's parents are constantly bending to her will. I would have a frank talk (as a unit) with your wife's parents about the fact that their acquiescence to Candy's behavior is damaging your relationship with them, and while you want to continue seeing them, either Candy needs to stop getting her way when she is being unreasonable, or you need to have separate get-togethers with your parents-in-law when she is not there. Candy obviously isn't going to change, it's the response to her behavior that needs to be modified if this is going to ever get better."
18,I'm so sorry. I think your husband is doing all the right things with regard to their interactions. You wouldn't want to hamper his career. Don't give her any more power over your lives.
19,No. Nooooo. I am so happy and proud of you for not getting in that car. That's 100% inappropriate for him to try to get you into s car and away from the city. You did the right thing and you honestly shouldnt continue meeting up with him. Your senses and intuition are valuable tools. Don't ignore them for someone elses sake!
20,"I agree with your girl friend, medication should never be tampered with. But not only that, he didn't believe you and watched you get sick. He tested you to make sure you were telling the truth. 

I won't ever want someone who tested me that way, especially if it had to do with my health."
21,Because he's 26 and her daughter is 19 I assume
22,"You should stop dating this guy. He doesn’t trust you, and you can’t change that. Don’t build a relationship on such shaky ground... it is not going to end well for you. He is going to keep bringing it up and throwing it in your face when he gets upset."
23,"I think the people who have suggested talking to her about the invite have the right idea, but because of the other issues you mentioned (mainly the seemingly lack of reciprocity and care), I wanted to mention something additional.

I have no idea if this is what is happening with this person, but something I've slowly come to realize over the past few years is that - due to my nature - some people come to see me as a kind of Attention and Care Utility. Like just open the tap and you'll get a pretty good listener, and someone who can be counted on to really try to be helpful and empathetic.

Because I am so reliably this, and because I do this right off the bat, regardless of how  \*I'm\* treated, two things often happen: 

1) a certain type of person realizes that this is a service I provide that they don't have to do anything more than activate it. Consciously or un-, they realize I do this \*regardless of what I'm given\* so they realize they don't have to use energy to be reciprocal with me.

2) I do this automatically and without ever evaluating if the other person has earned this level of attention and care.

Now, part of why I did this is because who wants relationships to be transactional?? And if I am a generous person, doesn't it require me to live my own values regardless of what I'm given??

Well, I've started to realize that there has to be some middle ground. It doesn't have to be transactional, and I am going to continue to be a generous person who wants to provide a lot of deep attention and care...but  I need to make sure I'm not burning up that energy on people who can't help me renew it by returning some attention and care back to me.

Ok that's a lot about me, I'm sorry, but I just see in your description of what you've now realized if this might be a mechanism at work with this person and in your life. And if so, I've realized a by-product of this dynamic is that this kind of person, in addition to not feeling a need to reciprocate, per the above, also never feels the need to, for lack of a better word, do anything to earn my friendship. 

So I could see this kind of person seeing their invitations as currency to spend to increase intimacy or impress someone they want to cultivate a relationship with but since you're already on board with providing hot and cold running care and attention, she doesn't need to ""spend"" an invitation on you.

Something I've had to do with some of these relationships is just re-frame them. I need to not think of this person as someone who can give me the kind of empathetic warmth and concern I might like, but they might be fun! They might be interesting, or they  might help the work day go by faster. But I no longer expect them to meet certain emotional needs, and I also, frankly, have put a bit of a limit on the hot and cold running care I was providing. Not punitively, but as self-protection. (And usually they don't seem to even notice! So I was wringing myself out for...what, exactly?!)

Anyway, I hope I haven't gone too far afield of your original issue, just some things that the additional details really made me think of in my own life."
24,She's your sister. Of course you tell her. Tell her before you tell him and if she doesn't believe you it's on her. If he's stupid enough to kiss his wife's sister with her in another room who knows what else he's done.
25,"He doesn't see you guys as women, he sees you as the little girls you were when you were first born. There's a ten year age gap between my baby brother and I and I know he's a teenager now but by god I still see that big eyed baby boy that called me ""sissy"" and wanted to snuggle with me all the time. Thats hard to let go.

But you shouldn't be afraid to remind him that you aren't that baby anymore. ""We're adults. We love and appreciate you, but it makes us uncomfortable to be treated like children."""
26,"How awful! 

Why didn’t she just not invite you in the first place? The whole thing is really mean. I wish people would say what they mean instead of tip toeing around and making a spectacle of someone for no reason."
27,"This type of instantaneous false intimacy is absolutely a bad sign. Red flags should be going off all over the place for you.

I think you should just grey rock her. Don't text her. Be polite to her when you see her in public but do not accept any further invitations. You are always ""busy"" from now on. Be as uninteresting as possible when you have to see her.

If the girls want to hang out, great. But if she shows up to pick up her daughter, you meet her outside and hand her daughter to her and say that you have to go because of whatever."
28,"During my wedding a bunch of people didn’t RSVP and I was foolish enough to be irritated and not nail them down on an answer. I got upset they couldn’t even RSVP and was similarly hurt. 

Turns out the indications never made it to majority of them that didn’t RSVP. We all sat around having our feelings hurt for no reason"
29,"I'm totally liberal about porn.

This isn't about porn.

This is about a man who actively seeks to insult and demean you. He didn't just choose something that hurts you. He chooses it because it hurts you. This was spite.

It's unlikely you can, or should, recover from something like this. He is fundamentally correct that you get to decide if you accept this or not. He is daring you not too. Call his bluff. End this relationship."
30,Do you understand what it's going to look like having your family along on these trips? It's not professional and makes you look incapable. You need to put your foot down and especially move out if you're still living there
31,"That kind of treatment does not just come out of nowhere. If your relationship had not changed in the months leading up to the wedding, had something big ever happened before? Did you not invite her to your wedding? Did you ever date her husband?

It seems like she was setting you up for a fall, and you're getting out just in time."
32,"So she doesn't want to have sex, but enjoys masturbating?

I think some very uncomfortable introspection needs to happen.....but not on her part. What are *you* doing to try and make it more pleasurable for her? 

If she doesn't get pleasure out of it, she isn't going to want to do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is above Reddit's pay grade. You need to seek professional couples counseling. If she refuses, I think you have your answer."
33,"Her mom brushed off her daughter’s symptoms and blamed you because she feels guilty. Honestly, her mom sounds like straight trash. 

Stay away from that dumpster woman."
34,"&gt; He wants to go to couples therapy

**Never EVER go to therapy with an abuser.**

All that will happen is that, as you unburden yourself in a supposedly safe space, he will use the information against you afterwards.  He will gaslight you, insisting that the therapist didn't say what you know damn good and well she did.  He'll try and wear you down and have you doubting your memories and feelings.

If that doesn't work?  He'll insist that the therapist is biased against him and refuse to go.  He'll counselor shop until he finds someone he's sure will side with him--i.e., someone incompetent who will do the lazy, ""the truth is somewhere in the middle"" bullshit.

Please, PLEASE, get therapy for yourself, alone.  Your husband is abusing you and it's only going to get worse.  You will reject the ""a"" word--victims always do at first--so if you want to call it ""toxic behavior,"" that's okay.  Having said that, can you look up the following terms for me?

* cycle of abuse

* trauma bonding

* gaslighting

* Issendai sick systems

Your husband's sudden change is par for the abuser's course.  They always wait for a moment when they believe that you are well and truly ""caught"" to start the bullying, the insults, the long slog to destroy your self-esteem.

I know, your first instinct will be to fix him.  Please don't.  You can't.  And no, it doesn't matter why he does what he does:  the important thing is that he IS doing it and that it will destroy you.

Please visit either/or Thehotline and loveisrespect.  Read through their resources. **Do not use any of your personal electronics to do this.** Get a copy of *Why Does He Do That?*, **but don't keep it anywhere that he can find it.**

This man will not only destroy *you,* he will destroy your children as well:  growing up in a home with an abuser is...abuse.  If you won't save yourself, PLEASE save your children.  If you don't, that will resent, even hate, you for having done nothing to protect them."
35,"I was (and still partially am) just like your bf. I always hated my birthday, for lots of reasons similar to his. 

One year, by happenstance, I was getting groceries on my birthfay when the person in front of me in line at the checkout didn't have their wallet with them. I opted in that moment to pay forward all the feelings I wanted to feel about my birthday (being loved, wanted, cared for, validated, etc...) and tried to give those feelings to a random stranger and bought their groceries for them. To this day I still do something kind for a random stranger or volunteer or donate on my birthday. It's saved my birthday and helped me prioritize what's really important for me. 

Maybe something like this can help him too?"
36,"You are lucky to have found out they would both value your relationships so little as to kiss with you right fucking there, before you got married.  Just imagine if they were drunk and had a little privacy.  

If you think she will be more worthy of your trust after getting married think again.  Could you imagine trusting her if you or she had to go out of town for a week for work?"
37,"Producer here. TBH, since you guys didn't apply as a team, and based on the details you've given about what they want your participation to be, I doubt they intend to show your private space at all. I can't imagine that would be a dealbreaker for them, and it's perfectly reasonable to ask for that accommodation.  

As for your on-camera involvement, I think the idea of having the friend do it instead could be totally fine. If they were intent on having specifically just you involved, they would have had you sign a release or contract already. It's more likely that they're just looking for a peripheral character in your sister's home life to give some additional commentary in what they call an OTF -- an on-the-fly interview of a few questions to give more depth to your sister's story from another perspective. So instead of you saying, ""My sister keeps saying she never has enough closet space for her shoes"", they'll get the friend saying, ""I told Jane she has to stop buying shoes until she gets her closet organized because every time I come over, I'm tripping over high heels."" 

In an ideal producer world, it's a neat, clean situation to have everyone in the home on board and ready to talk. Butttt 90% of production is finding another solution when things don't go exactly like clockwork."
38,"There was similar case here some time ago, with few suspects. Poster had a talk to each one of them and said something like: ""If i find money by that time at place XYZ, I will not report anything to the police"". Trick was that place XYZ was different for everybody, so that she could figure out who took the money."
39,"I’m gonna speak as a person who is generally super direct. But I’d like to offer you some advice. 

If you are so nonconfrontational that you don’t bring up issues that you are having with people, you are actively destroying the relationship. I’ve had people whom I considered friends just stew and fester in their frustration and resentment. I can tell something is off, but they won’t say what. I had a friend who I literally begged to tell me what was wrong and she kept insisting things were okay when they were not. 

I’m very aware I’m not perfect. I can rub people the wrong way. And that sometimes my mouth moves before my brain. If someone brings up something I’ve done to hurt them directly, about 95% of the time I agree with them and apologize and try to do better (5% saved for the people who are just clearly wrong??? Or trying to stir shit ig). And then I thank them because I realize that they value my friendship enough to trust me when they have issues. 

Drop this habit like a hot potato. You’re doing a ton of mind reading and looking into intentions that you don’t know. You’re deciding the type of person she is for her. If she’s really one of your best friends, you need to actually treat her like one and not a time bomb ready to go off. 

Maybe she didn’t invite you purposefully. Then she’s a jerk. 

But what if it was just a mistake. An oversight because weddings are insane and take up your entire life when you plan them and you have about ten thousand different things to do. Relatives to juggle. Events to coordinate. And people are capable of making mistakes. Especially under stress. 

What if she sent it in the mail and it got lost? Accidentally messed up your address. Or maybe it fell out of a stack of invitations and is under her couch. 

Or maybe it’s some other reason I haven’t dreamed up. 

Then you’re the jerk for assuming the worst about her. 

So go talk with her. The people whom I stopped caring for the fastest were the people who described themselves as “nonconfrontational”. If they decided how I reacted for me, they don’t deserve a second of my time or a fraction of a space in my brain."
40,"&gt;Well you aren't dead, are you?

Thank you, because I so badly wanted to say that as well.

You got lots of good advice already, so I just want to say that I'm sorry any of this happened at all."
41,"Listen, he can wait until you're comfortable. Sex is always best when both parties are into it."
42,"I, too, work at a law firm as a legal assistant and any one of us would be fired for those actions. That is very childish and unprofessional. She should be fired immediately. At first she didn’t seem that bad but because of the email that she sent back to the client potentially makes the firm look really bad."
43,Why is your mom not a big fan of his already?
44,"It takes a really mature, good person to step away from the hurt you are obviously feeling and just let it be for the sake of someone too selfish to do the same. I hope you find friends that are deserving of you.

I'm glad that you are feeling better about the situation and I wish you all the best!"
45,"When i took my kids on a 4 day trip w/o my husband he showed up at the train station at midnight, muscled his way on to the platform even though the train staff said it wasn't allowed. He said i was traveling alone and it would be impossible for me to get our kids and luggage off the train by myself. He waited until 1:30am with our stroller and baby carrier b/c of the delayed train. 

WHEN THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILDREN NEEDS YOU TO PICK HER UP AT THE AIRPORT, YOU PICK HER AND YOUR KIDS UP AT THE FUCKING AIRPORT."
46,I'm sorry is there a typo here? because you say he's 29 but you describe the behavior of a literal 9 year old.
47,"How is your response causing more of a scene then her asshole comment? 

She made the scene. You shut it down. ""That's just her personality"" is the coward's excuse for continuing to hang out with assholes and letting their asshole comments go unchallenged."
48,"You’re 33. At no age are you too old to go to concerts with friends. My mom is 60 and my dad slips extra money in her purse for drinks when she goes to see her favourite band and then sets an alarm for 1am so he can get up in his pajamas and drive her and all her friends home. 

Your husband has weird hang ups that aren’t your problem"
49,"""I realized recently that I have said and done things over the past 15 years that mocked your difficulty reading, and that hurt your feelings. I'm sorry that I did that, I won't do that again.""

And then don't do it again."
50,"Hey girl - just wanted to chime in and say that triptans arent as big of a deal as you think. I used to be really anxious about them as well, and it’s correct that you shouldn’t take more than the prescriber has advised in case of rebound headaches, but if you are in pain ffs take one. Agree with another commenter about seeing a migraine specialist. If they are keeping you from work there are other long term treatments that you can get in a doctors office, so your husband doesn’t have to be involved ."
51,This guy is 23 trying to lure a 15 year old into his car. I'd stay safe and stay away brother.
52,"Look, he shouldn’t be living with you. You sharing a bed? Then telling a 6 year old that you’re a special friend is inadequate and suggests a real lack of boundaries on his part. And we see that confirmed by his behavior. 

Is this an apartment well suited to a family, which you are? No. Should others be respectful, yes but not to the point of policing the content they watch. 

“Listen, we have a lot to navigate together and a lot we need to get right for (daughter). These past few weeks have shown me that we can’t continue this way. As a household with a child we will make significant noise, which means complaining about regular noise like a tv is going to create issues with our neighbors. I’m asking if you want to plan to look for another apartment together, better suited to families since this building is mostly young professionals.” 

Not a fan of how he is navigating this with his daughter and he’s got poor boundaries. Be wary."
53,"Just say you follow the stock market. It reveals your interest without giving away your personal financial info.

It's probably not a good idea to be revealing your net worth to people you're just dating. Usually people don't reveal their salaries either, which is a comparable thing."
54,This is exactly what I think is happening and I'm irritated that OP and her friend won't just communicate.  This is the kind of crap you see in books with lazy authors.   It shouldn't be happening in real life!
55,If he was hungry he could've cooked his own fucking dinner. Nothing about his behavior is acceptable.
56,"Don’t stay with a man who uses his penis as a weapon to hurt you.  He’s jerking of in front of you yo upset you.  It’s not uncommon in sex offenders to enjoy the distress they cause.

He oughtright told you he cares more about jerking it whenever he wants than you.  Believe him."
57,"That is such good advice.  Don't go to therapy with an abuser.  

Also, with the extent of the games that he's playing I have to assume the therapy idea is some other fucked up 'prank' or whatever you call his jerky actions.  

OP, look up 'grey rocking'.  With someone like this it might be your best way of handling them.  You just give them nothing, like a rock.  


The worst reason he could have for acting like this is he's planning to leave and is trying to get ammunition for custody by making you seem crazy/angry.


The best reason he could have for acting like this is he's an abusive jerk."
58,"It sounds like you make enough to be out on your own? Especially if you get roommates. Why stay at home with lazy parents when you can have your own place, and only your own responsibilities to worry about? (And if your parents aren't taking proper care of their pets you should anonymously call the animal control hotline on them after you have safely moved out those animals don't deserve that)."
59,You’re an awesome person and anyone would be lucky to have you as a friend.
60,"He pretty much is breaking up with you but doesn't want to do it because of his low self esteem. He wants to see if he can do better. Your relationship is over. He just doesn't want to let go in case he can't find someone else. He doesn't want to be alone.

Break up with him, permanently. The longer you hold on to this relationship the harder it is for both of you."
61,A really mature response! Well done OP for how you've handled all this.
62,"Take a breath. Now another. The guy you are with is insecure about himself and that has very little to do with you.

You aren't crazy. You haven't done anything wrong. You aren't over reacting.

You have every right to be proud, over the moon happy dance proud of yourself. Someone who is right for you will be cheering right along with you and telling you how much you deserve to be recognized for your hard work. They will be happy for you, not threatened by your success.

You need to break up right now.  At no point in a healthy relationship should you be made to feel the way you do right now.

It's going to be ok.  Please don't date for maybe a year and settle into your new program and life. Make an appointment with counseling on campus and keep up with those appointments. 

Stop excusing red flags during the screening process of boyfriends. Trust your instincts and give yourself permission to walk away. Just because you were abused once doesn't mean it can't and won't happen again. Figure out what attracted you to both partners (what they had in common) and what red flags you chose to ignore.
You obviously don't trust yourself yet, and that's normal after abuse. Work with a professional until you're confident you can avoid the same patterns going forward, or at least run when you see them.

And seriously, Congratulations!"
63,"You didn't really have a choice but to make a scene - she was very blatantly being rude to you. It's the verbal equivalent to her smacking you and you pushing her away in self defense - you did nothing wrong. I hate when people use the defense ""that's just how they are,"" uh no, it's not, they're rude. 


Good for you for putting her in her place. Roommate is probably just defensive to avoid her anger. I wouldn't worry about it."
64,Why not go kayaking with your kids and friends? I definitely didn't do everything with both parents growing up.
65,"It sounds like you never fully processed it, and for whatever reason, your brain is saying now is the time. Even if you don’t resent your husband for it, and even though it has never happened again and you know it was a mistake, it can still impact you. Having a partner hit you is scary and breaks the trust -even if it was a one-off, it can still be traumatic. I’ve had traumatic events in my childhood that I didn’t even realize were traumatic until much later in life when I was able to acknowledge that fact. Sometimes we don’t acknowledge things as traumatic so as not to let them get to us, or to avoid admitting to ourselves that that trauma might have had an effect. 

Talk to him about it. Let him know that although you forgave him, you can’t stop thinking about it. Getting it off your chest and talking it through with your husband might make it stop hanging around in your brain. Maybe you need a second apology? Maybe you need him to assure you it was a mistake? Or maybe you just need to know if it haunts him like it’s haunting you?"
66,"Becoming independent from your family should be your first concern right now.

1) Make a budget
2) Start looking for shared accommodations (near your workplace if transportation is an issue)
3) PM me if you need help with figuring out how to move out. I'm pretty decent at logistics since I moved out at 16 due to a shitty family.
4) Enjoy your new freedom without your garbage family!"
67,"I hope that means there isn't any abuse, not that they just got better at hiding it. Do you ever see the children?

You don't need anything about attachment theory to know that verbal or emotional abuse is bad for children."
68,"Carl is a pretty massive asshole. No means no. And it's good your friends are standing up for you, but he's obviously not taking the hint. At this rate he might be kicked out of the friend group"
69,Court ordered paternity tests are a thing.  This is also a situation better handled by legaladvice
70,"""It isn't racist, it's just biased.""

Yeah, towards Hispanic women. What an idiot."
71,"He’s a manipulative jerk. You are not overreacting. What he did was childish. He’s a grown ass man. He can make his own food. 

Dump this loser now."
72,"Would you have cried like that if he hadn't been your ex? It sounds like at this point he was just a friend that you cared about, so it's totally normal to be very upset by a sudden death like that."
73,"&gt; I know some of you are gonna be like “girl go to HR” but my field is still very sexist and conservative and Paul makes a lot of money for the firm. They are going to pick him over me 100 time out of 100.

You already need a new job. Don’t wait for shit to hit the fan. Get out of there. 

Your boyfriend also sucks. You don’t *need* a new one, but you don’t need this one either. Consider this a valuable piece of information about his character. Thank u, next."
74,"This specific incident may never happen again because he's satisfied himself that you're telling the truth about your personal health. But the fact that he did this -- and lied to your face so calmly and cold-heartedly -- represents a deep character flaw that *will* manifest itself in other ways over the course of your relationship. If you stay with him you're teaching him that his behaviour has no consequences and you will let him get away with hurting you.

Honestly your description of how he acted during and after gives me chills. He had many opportunities to come clean and give you your meds before you were in pain, but his need to be right about your health trumped your pain -- nevermind the awful physical pain, but the mental pain as well. Even if you *had* been a hypochondriac, or exaggerating your pain, or a bit of a baby about it (that's me) what he did was still so wrong.

I don't mind if my partner rolls their eyes when I complain about how much feeling sick sucks, but I know they would never, ever deny me medication if I asked for it because we have a relationship built on mutual trust and respect. And if they were concerned they'd sit me down and have a fucking conversation about it like a normal, non-psychopathic human being."
75,"Agreed. If you’re not close enough to ask, then you’re not close."
76,"Remind yourself that her joy doesn't come at a cost to you. That you aren't in any kind of competition with her and if your family is getting bigger it only means more love will be coming into your extended family lives. 

Lean on your husband and talk through your feelings, just being able to share them and commiserate might help. Maybe consider talking to a doctor together about conceiving if you haven't already to see if you've explored all your options etc."
77,"I’m most concerned about your husband’s inability to talk to your teenager daughter like a person. 

If she’s normally very polite and acting rude is out of character, maybe she was just having a bad day? Or a bad moment?? 

The lesson your husband taught your daughter has nothing to do with her not being rude; he taught her that the slightest slip up — the slightest sign of having a bad day or a bad feeling, means being punished. 

I grew up like this. It was incredibly damaging. I’ve had to do a lot of work in therapy to undo the damage. 

All he had to say to her was, “we don’t speak to people we love like that.” Instead, he decided to humiliate her. That’s troubling. 

TL;DR - I agree with you, OP. Your husband’s punishment was extreme and unnecessary."
78,"I think you need a slightly softer touch if you want your daughters to stay friends. You might try something like: ""It was nice to have lunch, but I want to give you a head's up I am really busy, so you won't hear much from me."" 


Then just mute/ignore her texts. See if she starts backing off after a few days. 


If she doesn't you might have to just suck it up and be blunt, even if it does make things weird between your daughters."
79,I think the correct phrasing should be: sex is only okay when both parties are into it.
80,"Yeah, this was pretty shitty of your boyfriend to do. He got jealous OF A DEAD GUY. 

I would go to your bf and say ""I understand why you were upset at the funeral, and that you're worried that my feelings for my ex are bigger than they are for you. They are not. But the way that you treated me for mourning a tragedy in a perfectly reasonable way was not okay. It was petty and was not supportive of me during my mourning. I deserve an apology.""

See how it goes when you emotionally validate him but then call out the bad behavior and ask him to remedy it."
81,"It’s not the same story but my sister in law slept with my ex boyfriend while we were dating and she was dating my brother. It was awful, but my brother chose to forgive and marry her anyways and my mom just told me to get over it. I said, “she didn’t sleep with your husband did she? No, so don’t tell me to get over it.” It’s a betrayal, there is no trust. I’m sorry family can be the worst, the ones who are supposed to have your back, sometimes never do. I don’t blame you, I wouldn’t go to the wedding, they are all disgusting for acting like it’s not a big deal."
82,"&gt; I can’t call the police because there’s really no proof I had that much money.

You should still call the police. You should also *tell your BF and roommate* before you do.

By which I mean: tell them that you're going to file a police report. The police will be coming to investigate, check out the crime scene, interview your BF and roommate, etc. Also remind them that this will (most likely, depending on where you live) be considered grand theft, which is a serious charge.

If one of them is guilty, they can come forward now, and you can sort this out without police involvement. And if they're not guilty, they should be fully onboard with cooperating with the police to find the real culprit.

The final step is to *follow through with calling the police* if no one comes forward. It doesn't matter if you have ""no proof you had that much money"" - let the police decide how much they can investigate, that's part of their job.

And of course, as others have pointed out, moving forward (a) don't keep large sums of cash in your room, and (b) consider setting up a cheap camera in your room, to get harder evidence on any would-be thieves."
83,Being a parent is an *earned* position. He didn't earn it.
84,"Perhaps enquire with your parents as to how they think they will be regarded by their peers, when everyone learns that they were so willing to disown their daughter over a Facebook post."
85,Cop here.  This is a civil matter but here are some tips.  You have established residency there.  So she can’t kick you out.  She is the registered owner of the car so it is hers.  It is possible to establish co-ownership of the vehicle but that would most likely come down in court.  I would recommend not making payments in it.
86,"He is being AWFUL. Just inexpressibly shitty. 

He's mad that you're spending a lot of time with your mom after suffering terrible losses *within the last two months??* What are you supposed to do, shrug it off? A good partner would be trying to make this easier on you, not hounding you for attention and threatening to break up with you. 

Also, truly, who cares if he decides that you've broken up with him and not the other way around? He's playing on your desire to not be the bad guy. Don't fall for it. Go ahead and say, ""Yeah, after you said you wanted to break up, I realized that was the right thing for me too. I'm sorry you've changed your mind, but I haven't. We are broken up."""
87,"She was invited to my wedding, and I was alrwady dating my now husband when she met her boyfriend so we definite did not date.

I don't want to imagine how much worse it would have been if I had stayed. I just wish I knew why, since no one seems to know."
88,"Man, imagine being ""disappointed"" with your child for wanting to study math.  I can only hope that my son causes my such grief when he grows up.

Since you've already done 1.5 years of engineering, could you get a minor or dual degree?  Giving yourself options is never a bad thing."
89,"Yes, you can tell him not to come. I know it sucks and seems awkward because he’s family but you get to choose who you want and don’t want in your life and he’s frankly not invited to this event. I hope your show is amazing and It sounds like your mom would’ve been hella proud ❤️"
90,just...stop leaving clothes there?
91,"Just end it. Nothing you wrote indicates there is anything worth salvaging. 


He’s 25. If he was serious about your relationship he would at the very least be actively keeping you in the loop in terms of major plans on your shared birthday weekend. He sounds self-centered and taking advantage of your willingness to put up with crap. 


You are 20. Go out and have fun and meet all sorts of people. There is no point in being tied down with a ldr with someone who shows very little interest in you and who you have nothing positive to say about either."
92,"OP, I think you should go to unsocial counseling for a while to help you make this decision. One question I have for you: What do you think would happen if you stopped trying so hard? Would he be upset and take it out on you? Because I think you could try that for a while. Just try caring less about his feelings and stop trying to make him happy. Try doing things that make YOU happy, and see if you can just let his grumpiness roll off your back.

If you think he relies on you to keep his mood even as stable as it is, and would become angry at you if you didn’t bend over backwards, then that’s a big problem. But you might find that it’s just liberating. And it might help you shed light on your decision."
93,No it wouldn't be weird. She'd be very happy most likely hearing how she was a positive influence on one of her students. Go far it if you wish. Nothing wrong with it and could make her really happy.
94,I think it's time to stop inviting Candy and Joe to your wife's birthday dinners.
95,"Tell Velvet you need to be scheduled a week ahead of time. Your schedule has changed and you're no longer as flexible. You have to be more strict with time, so you can no longer do such chores for her that cost 5 min. 

You don't view this as a business as you should. This is a side gig, but it's a service that costs you time and money. Imagine, with those 15 min. you spend a week on Velvet, you could walk another dog for 7 bucks. Velvet is not going to like it and she might even cancel ultimately. Some clients you shouldn't want to keep. She considers you her exclusive walker, but she doesn't pay you in the same way nor appreciate you as such. If money is tight, heck, a home made cake is a nice gift. So be a lot less flexible for Velvet. 

Also look carefully at what other dogwalkers offer and how they price themselves. Do they ask extra for training? How do they organize that? If you don't educate yourself, you could get into trouble. An unruly pup that attacks someone, will be on your head. So make sure you are organized properly, also insurancewise, but stick to very firm rules about expectations and reality."
96,"Man, don’t date someone who gets jealous when you are sexually harassed at work. Just... don’t."
97,"That's absolute bullshit. You're doing the right thing putting your kids first. No question. It's unfortunate to be pulling this after you've been together for so long, but better now than when you'd have moved in together and committed all the more."
98,"About ten years ago (when I was 23-24) my entire group of best friends completely ghosted me after I moved to my hometown for health reasons. It killed me for years because I had no idea why, and they clearly did it as a group decision. I found out literally a decade and several big moves later through a completely unrelated mutual friend that one or several of them decided to convince the rest that I had BURNED MY APARTMENT BUILDING DOWN???? Which is especially hilarious because that specific fire they blamed me for fire did happen - while I was no longer living in the building but still had almost most of my belongings inside.  I trust the way this info got back to me, and I find it hilarious now. 

Anyway my point is this is awful, and I’m sorry she did this to you - but she has proved what a shitty friend she is. Even if there was some previous issue that had been compounding, there’s no reason for this kind of childish bullshit. Even if she hadn’t blocked you, she’d clearly be unable to have a basic conversation with you about her feelings."
99,Throw the whole boyfriend away.
100,"She is ""that bad"".  

She came into my office a little while ago with a file and started off by saying ""I know this is going to get back to (my boss), but I HAVE to ask you ..."" and I stopped her right there and said ""Why on earth would you preface a question to ME with a statement like that?  I don't need the attitude.  Just ask me your question and I'll answer it.  Stop it with the nonsense.""

I don't know how she ever kept a job before."
101,"You need to find who to report this to on campus right away.  He is a stalker and these things can escalate.  For your safety you may need to report him to campus security and someone from housing.  

Tell them everything you shared here.

Document everything."
102,"I mean easy solution is to stop paying for this leech’s expenses full stop whether he lives with you or not. 

Problem solved. 

Why the hell are you putting up with this?!"
103,"DO NOT move out. She can't make you do so, and if you leave you'll severely compromise yourself when it comes to a custody fight."
104,"I wouldn't go over. 

I can't believe how awful they were to you when you were having an operation. It's staggering that you were ill in that way and they wouldn't support you. 

I don't think you owe them honesty. I would just tell them you are working all weekend and that you don't have the time or money to make the trip down for the foreseeable future. 

Study the JADE concept which is don't Justify, Argue, Defend or Explain."
105,"Your friend is right.

Look on the bright side - at least you’re not diabetic and didn’t die because your boyfriend hid your insulin.  His decision that he has the right to control your body only caused you some temporary unnecessary intense pain and vomiting this time.

I don’t believe this will be the last time he decides not to believe you (or the medical community) and decides he has the right to control what happens to you (or any children you have).

If you decide to stay, it would be wise to give a medical power of attorney to someone you can trust, especially if you are going to give birth.  He might also decide you don’t need an epidural or c-section."
106,This sounds like the behavior of a guy that’s trying to get dumped so he doesn’t have to do it himself. No one who’s actually into their partner acts like this.
107,"So, this is what's happening here.  Candy rocks the boat and everyone runs around trying to stop the boat from rocking instead of making Candy responsible for rocking the boat.  Your MIL just wants peace, but - much like handling a toddler - giving her what she wants will just make the problem worse.  

You need to sit your MIL and FIL down and tell them that getting along isn't about constantly giving in to someone who is engaging in emotional extortion.  The person then learns that it works and continues to up the ante.  You need to create some boundaries and make those clear to both Candy and your MIL/FIL.  

Unfortunately you cannot control anyone else but yourselves, so create your boundaries and hold to those boundaries.  People like Candy eventually out themselves to everyone.  Sometimes it take time, but until that happens, you have to be consistent.  You do not have to continue to invite her to events to 'keep the peace'."
108,"Considering the fact that you have had sex three times this year and he jumped straight to blaming you for giving it to him via oral sex, I’d personally assume he had recently cheated.   I’m rather jaded though,  I admit."
109,"Maybe do it via text, and phrase it as 'I just wanted to double check I'm not invited, instead of my invite getting lost in the mail and you thinking I' m rude for not rsvping. Obviously I understand if I am not and its fine either way, weddings are expensive and guest lists can be so difficult. '

Obviously you don't mean the second part, but it gives her an easy out and should help with the awkwardness."
110,"Exactly what I thougt. Of course it's not easy to tell somebody he is not wanted, but in this case it is more than justified"
111,"If the furniture is yours and you are paying rent, set a boundary and let your bf know you aren't comfortable having him over in your shared spaces until he address his smell. I think it's reasonable and is there any reason they would have to hang out at your apartment? Not having him over doesn't mean they couldn't still see each other and you shouldn't have to pay to store your furniture because of just one of his friends."
112,"When someone genuinely isn't really interested in food or doesn't really have much awareness of it, there's not much you can do about it. Some people just... don't. 

What you can do - what I think you need to do - is not tie your love of food to him. Invite friends over for dinner regularly, have Open House Sunday Lunch with friends, have a regular Wednesday Friendsday Dine-Out.

If where you go doesn't matter to him? That's okay - you have to accept that there's no magical answer that'll change that, and pick based on what you like. He can have veto, maybe, if there are things that he thinks will be unpleasant, but pick based on your own enjoyment."
113,"Of course you aren't overreacting, Jesus. You deserve to be upset and if you want to call things off with the both of them, 100% valid."
114,Aside from being a fully grown adult dating her naive teenage daughter?
115,"Your husband is the one who needs to deal with his parents, and he very clearly has not. Sending angry texts messages is not how he should have dealt with the post. Allowing them to literally replace him in the NICU before he had held his own child is not how he should have dealt with that. The conversations you need to have with him are about how he deals with his parents, not about the two of you. It is his job to reprimand his mom, set up boundaries, and help smooth things over between you and her. He is doing 0% and needs to be doing 100%"
116,"Ok, this is a little weird and goofy - but can you practice?


Get a close friend you trust and have her practice announcing pregnancy to you. Then you can practice your reaction.


It won't be the most authentic happiness you've ever performed, but it should help you."
117,"I was listening to a podcast and someone brought up how couples are ""supposed"" to sleep together in the same bed. The guest replied ""who made that up though? Why do they **have to** sleep in the same bed? They went on to talk about how decades ago it was completely normal for couples to have two separate smaller beds but sleeping in one was somehow more romanticized. Imo do what makes you happy. You literally can't sleep well and it's effecting your relationship and your physical health. Try to explain to your husband it's not that you don't want to sleep with him you just want to be able to sleep period."
118,"Your husband doesn't seem to give a shit about you and your feelings at all. He is abusive and if you don't want to subject your kids to his abuse, you need to leave."
119,"They'll soon notice how much you did when you're not there to do it for them.

This isn't right. They have responsibilities and whilst you are an adult now, you've been doing this shit for years, when really, you should have been doing kid stuff.

I would advise that as soon as you get the opportunity to move out for good, you do so. Whether that means college or when you graduate, it needs to happen. They're not going to change because they've become so reliant on you and your siblings over the years. 

I hope college goes well for you and I'm sorry to hear about your recent break up"
120,"Has he gone with you to see the migraine specialist (you need to be seeing someone whose expertise is migraine) and had the doctor explain to him about your condition, the purpose of the medication and how your husband can be of help? 

Do that plus some couples counseling. Right now this is your new normal and it takes some adjustment that counseling can help facilitate."
121,"\&gt;""I realized recently that I have said and done things over the past 15 years that mocked your difficulty reading, and that hurt your feelings. *That was a shitty thing to do.* I'm sorry that I did that, I won't do that again.""

I would add that you know it was a bad thing, outside of just hurting your feelings. Sometimes an apology is better if you explicitly acknowledge that what you did was bad, it can alleviate some worries on their part that they're just being sensitive."
122,"My best friend of seven years ""ghosted me"" when we were both 24, blocking me on all social media after we hadn't talked for a while. No explanation. In the end I wasn't even upset because who wants a friend like that?

This ""friend"" of yours seems like an immature drama queen to not confront you about what was bothering her and then throw you under the bus at her wedding in front of all of her friends. You're better off."
123,"I have an ex-friend who has said that she will makes plans with people then cancel the day of because ""it's easier for her than saying no"" in the first place. 

Maked absolutely no sense at all."
124,"Also pregnancy, trashing him publicly, calling him an abuser, promises of change and apologies, tears."
125,"100% If Frank is ok being smelly, then he can go through life being smelly. But don't let his smelliness ruin your things. That's the price he pays for his lack of hygiene."
126,"You should be glad this loser is moving out. Stop paying for all his stuff, except the loan you cosigned. You're stuck with that until it's paid off."
127,"C is **NOT** your friend, she a co-worker who you are friendly with, don't be confused."
128,she may have some sort of mental issues that cause these delusions. she should consider seeing a doctor. what does her mom have to say about all of this? does she know??
129,"You guys absolutely did the right thing. Your wife's family sounds just as toxic as yours, just that she hasn't drawn any boundaries with them yet so they haven't had the chance to show their true colors.

What kinds of awful people cut off family members because they won't co-sign a mortgage? What kinds of awful people expect you to give up your own shot at a mortgage and give it to them?

I'm glad your wife is in therapy. This is probably going to escalate, so just make sure she has as much support as possible, reinforce that you guys made the right decision, and help her as she grieves the fact that her family is full of shit people."
130,"He at least owes you the complete truth about why he doesn't want to do it to you. Sex and communication are two pretty important factors in a relationship. I don't think anyone would blame you for wanting to breakup over this. While it might seem like a small thing,  the fact that he can't be honest about it makes it a big deal."
131,I bet he’s laying the groundwork for his cheating so she owes him a forgiveness
132,"This is very good news!

Also must comment on something that’s driving me nuts. Your spelling and punctuation are great except: 

You filed a REPORT.

Rapport means a close relationship between parties where they understand each other well. “Steve and I work well together as we have a pretty good rapport.” 

Just wanted to let you know as you used it about 5 times. Not sure if English is a second language for you but if it is, it’s otherwise fantastic :)"
133,"You’re right, They don’t have good credit because they weren’t responsible with previous purchases they made. They insist that it’s different now but I’m way more skeptical than that and i don’t want our future tainted because of failure to pay."
134,"&gt; You think he’d take the hint. 

Why are you just dropping hints? Tell this man you blame him for your friend's death, tell him to get fucked, then block him on everything. If he drops by your house tell him to leave, if he does not call the police. If he reaches out publicly, respond that he caused your friend's death (publicly shame the ever-living shit out of him) then block him out of your life."
135,"OP, you're awesome. I wish I had a friend like you, your colleague is missing out!"
136,"I really wish you hadn't left out what happened to him earlier that day. 


Did they do finger painting before or after nap time? And what flavor was his juice box?"
137,He admits right there that you've been generous in the past. Tell him that it's time for your sister to be generous for once and that you won't stand for one-sided relationships anymore.
138,"Here’s how you know he’s lying, aside from all the other obvious flashing neon signs—a person whose girlfriend has just found a used condom in the closet, twisted up in his filthy clothes, doesn’t start calling that girlfriend a psycho for wondering where it came from. The person who does that is panicking, and has reached that point where the executive brain shuts down and totally stupid, batshit gibberish just starts falling out of their mouth.

So. There’s that."
139,"Well, if you let her, she certainly *can* take advantage of you. But you have all the power here, so I'm not sure why you're letting it happen. 


If you do the small chores, and she doesn't pay you, then ask to be paid. If she still doesn't pay, you're no longer available to do small chores. 


If you're feeling taken advantage of because of the discount, let her know that you were able to do the reduced rate for a time but you no longer are. If she wants your services, from now on it needs to be the full rate. If she can't pay it, oh well, best of luck to her."
140,"""Hey, I have real concerns about Frank. I do not want him visiting our place and stinking it up when we move in together. Can we talk about it? I will not be ok with that smelly person in our home ruining our stuff."""
141,I’m pretty sure he’s cheating on you. I’m very sorry but no grown man gets drunk weekly with another woman after his wife says she’s in comfortable if there isn’t something more happening.
142,"Dude, your girlfriend has a girlfriend."
143,"So....you don't even know why she's unhappy.

You are guessing it's stale.

First off:  you need to communicate.  It's pretty obvious from your post that the communication is lacking for a relationship of 10 years.

Then there is the fact that you quickly point out ""stale/boredom/mundane"".  I'm gonna say....if you are so able to identify that it's likely gone to the point of no return in this relationship.  This is the classic issue seen around here where you've done nothing to work on the relationship until one person states that they are done.  Too little to late.   You can try, therapy would be a good start.  But, if she's out, let her go OP."
144,"I think that it might be in the husband’s best interest to say something at work - maybe speak to his manager and get some written evidence that Rachel is starting to cross boundaries. I know that’s not usually the best idea, and she hasn’t done much at this point, but she’s shown that she willing to fabricate evidence to hurt people, and I worry that she may retaliate against your husband because he hasn’t fallen into line. Even if he just creates a paper trail of their interactions (maybe keeping a journal), so that if the shit hits the fan you’ve got some kind of evidence that backs up your version of events."
145,"Exactly. This is such an important point - your mom had little means yet helped make your dreams come true. Your dad scarcely knows you, yet scrambled to take credit for the very beautiful story you'd just shared about her on live TV. 

You are fulfilling the dream life she hoped to help create for you; these moments are about you, and her. He is a brief footnote at this point, at best. He certainly has no reason to be included in this chapter."
146,"\&gt;he kept asking me if I would come back to his car, and we could drive to someplace better in his neighborhood. He actually didn't ask, just said it in a matter-of-fact way.  


This exact situation happened with a coworker of mine. I take public transit but everyone else at my company drives. Just like 'L', my coworker 'offered' to give me a ride home...and just like 'L', he actually didn't ask, just said it in a matter-of-fact way. And kept stating that, even after I repeatedly declined the ride. He was so persistent that I asked my boss to walk me out of the building just in case L showed up &amp; tried to keep pressuring me (which is exactly what happened, but thankfully my boss had my back).

&amp;#x200B;

His ride offer made no sense--he would have to drive significantly out of his way, during rush hour, to take me home. L's behavior left me so unsettled that I went home &amp; googled him. Turns out, he had recently been released from prison after serving 10 years for trying to kill his wife. L had a history of stalking &amp; domestic violence that went back longer than I've been alive.   


Six months later, he was arrested again for installing a tracker on a woman's car. I'm really glad I didn't get into his car. You did the right thing. Nobody deserves your trust--they have to earn it. Please don't doubt yourself, or feel guilt. Even if your L is perfectly innocent, you aren't a bad person for prioritizing your safety. Have a (non creeper) internet hug &amp; stop worrying about this. You handled it very well."
147,I think that sadly you will likely not find an answer to this. She has treated you horribly and you’re better off without her. I think the best thing you can do is to try and move on.
148,"Holy shit! NOPE.  Nope nope, this would be a massive deal breaker for me.  This is a huge breach of trust.

He treated you like you were an “experiment” and took away medication you **need** just to see if you were faking or not.  Thats absolutely uncalled for and is a huge red flag.  It was already uncool that he didn’t exactly believe you had migraines, it’s completely crossing the line that he actually hid your medication.


I have ADHD, so I take stimulant medication daily.  It would be an absolute deal breaker if my boyfriend tampered with my medication."
149,"Can you approach it as looking for guidance, not looking for credit?  Your boss might be more receptive to something like that.  Maybe something like ""boss, do you have a minute?  I would like to know how you want me to handle a situation.  Co-worker asked me for help with X project, and since it was already overdue I agreed and spent several hours over the weekend conducting interviews for him.  Now that he has been given a larger project I am unsure if he is going to expect my help or not.  I want to be a team player, but I also have my own responsibilities here.  If you would like me to help him I can, but that means [other project] might be delayed.""  That way your boss is aware of the situation, and you hopefully get to learn how they would prefer you to handle it."
150,"I think you've probably guessed correctly.

I agree with OP's interpretation in that I think it most accurately reflects what marriage does: it legally, officially makes somebody your next-of-kin. Next-of-kin = closest living relative.

However, I bet you're right that he just pictures a family as being a group, whereas two partners are a couple. It's probably just an issue of OP and her husband having different semantic interpretations."
151,"You should flat out say you're not interested in him and if he keeps literally stalking you you'll talk to the gym management and get him thrown out. You owe this man nothing and he's stalking you trying to get you to be interested in him. Tell him to stop and if it keeps happening get a restraining order. Full stop. That's creepy as all hell, he legit found where you work out and is now gaslighting you to make it seem that you've initiated it. Get out now."
152,"Why would he change when yours doing everything and enabling his lazy ass.

You're 19, dump this chump.  He's a literal parasite bleeding you dry."
153,"I'm confused.  Do they not have a living room?  Why is she staying in his room?  How is she paying rent when she's ""carless and jobless""?

Why isn't he letting her use the room and staying at your house with you? 

What is he saying about how he'll be staying over at yours and making time for just you while she's staying? (Sounds like he's not)

Seriously what does this place look like that there is no other room she can sleep in?!  Its called "" couch surfing"" for a reason."
154,"&gt; Is there anything else we can do?

  
Yes. You can work hard to ensure that you stay focused on your bright future with your loving partner. 

The history you describe with Rachel sounds horrible. That she still referred to you by that name and seems interested in worming her way back into your sphere speaks to her lack of growth as a human being. You're right to feel the way that you do about her and I don't mean to take that away from you. 

However - there are a few very important things that you need to keep in mind;

* It is in the past and she is out of your life
* You have a loving husband who takes your concerns about this seriously and is on your team
* Social media is an inaccurate way to gauge someone's life

You need to work hard to avoid playing this game;

&gt;After he told me this I got curious. I looked her up on social media. I always assumed that with the amount of drinking, weed and coke she did at school she'd end up ugly and ruined by now. Instead, she's even more beautiful than she was before. Her facebook profile says she went to a great uni. I googled her name and she's made a complete success of her life. She was always effortlessly smart in school days but by now the reputation she has in her field is unbelievable. I know I sound jealous and petty, and I am satisfied with my life. I'm happily married to a man I love and work a job I enjoy, but it feels like Rachel has everything she's ever wanted, and the fact that she still calls me the name I hate means she's just as nasty as before. I had to have therapy for years because of her, and it just seems like nothing bad ever happens to her. I still sometimes the fat girl who nobody feels sorry for because the bully is a pretty girl

I know that you can say the words ""I don't mean to be jealous and petty, my life is good and I am satisfied"" out loud and mean them. That doesn't make ruminating on her success in life despite being horrid a healthy exercise for you. Block her from social media too. Excise the toxin from your life and your mind. Don't give her any more power over you and your happiness than she's already stolen. Some people are just bad people who lack empathy and the ability to treat others well. No amount of medical lisences, flashy Instagram photos, or money can fix that shit.

Your husband has taken extremely reasonable steps to back you up and defend you from this person. His leaving his job to avoid her would cross the line into unreasonable. Unless Rachel starts escalating her efforts to interfere in your lives, it's time to start to think about this less. You've identified the threat, it's been responded to appropriately, time to get back to loving your husband and enjoying your life!"
155,"There is absolutely no difference between your girlfriend flirting with another woman or another man.Would you accept her pursuing another man?If you are okay with an open relationship then ask her is that what she wants,otherwise she is looking for your permission to cheat."
156,I know others have said it but if your name isn't on anything attached to said apartment just pack up and move out. You don't owe her anything. It doesn't sound like she felt guilty when dropped the bomb on you. That's what I call karma
157,"“Look, it’s been on my mind and I’ve just got to ask: You’ve delivered all of your wedding invitations and I didn’t get one and why is that?”"
158," Just coming back to the ""not wet enough"" point, you've mentioned that was the case with past boyfriends to so grab some lube! 
If anything it will help you to relax not having that part to worry about.  (not to mention it drastically reduces the chance of condoms tearing and helps the fun for everyone) 

On the other point, wait for as long as you want, he sounds like a decent guy that would be ok with that."
159,This is spot on. You've given me a lot to think about here because you've completely described me too. Thank you for this.
160,"You owe these people nothing. 

You don't owe your sister being at her shitty sham wedding, for a marriage that isn't going to last, because she's marrying a cheater

whether she wants to admit that or not. 

Your mom wants to keep the peace and not have her daughters and each others throats, and thats understandable, 

but she doesn't get to demand that you act like these people didn't hurt you severely, just because that would make her life easier."
161,"This. All day. Part of recovering from abuse is legitimizing and trusting your feelings again after you've been taught to doubt yourself. If his behavior doesn't feel kind, it's not."
162,"Unfortunately these things take time. While I'm glad that you guys have opened the door to reconciliation, it sadly won't happen automatically. You both have to make the effort as well. I'm rooting for you!"
163,"Sometimes people need a reality check to truly become better people in life.  Remember youdidn't create this,  she did. Be honest,  be tactful and kind,  but be firm.  And you can always add that if she sorts things out that she can reach out later; she may not hear that now but she'll remember later when she matures."
164,"FYI, with some abusers, doing the grey rock triggers them to ESCALATE. They will escalate to crazier and crazier behavior until they can get a reaction.

So there is also something I think of as a managed reaction or deliberate reaction. If I am stuck with an abuser, I will give them the reaction they are looking for, FAKELY. I will cry and beg ... over something they did that I don't actually care about. That will often satisfy them long enough for me to get out of the situation if I am stuck with them."
165,"Don't be torn about this.  He is 10000000000000% in the wrong here.  His anxiety is not your fault or your problem to fix.  What you want to do is TOTALLY NORMAL.  My parents still go to concerts and they are in their 60's!  It's not an age thing to want to enjoy live music.  

&gt;  He thinks I'm still going to return to my ""old ways"" 

That is another HUGE problem.  He's judging you for a totally normal past, and he's projecting about your trustworthiness with zero reason to.

These are serious issues, OP.   You cannot allow him to start dictating your life or manipulating and controlling you this way.  Put your foot down, go to the concern, and if he causes a fuss, insist on marriage counseling immediately.  These are RED flags that you cannot ignore."
166,"This has to stop. Bringing your family along on business trips is a terrible idea. It makes you look incompetent. You need to become independent, move out and keep your business activities private. You do not need to tell them where you are going. You are 22."
167,You're relieved that you're away from your abuser. You are under NO obligation to feel bad about this.
168,As far as I'm concerned trying to reason with anti-vaxxers is a lost cause. If I were you I'd focus my efforts on convincing new baby's parents how serious the danger is.

170,"Lay out the budget, lay out what her HALF of the expenses should be, and tell her when she has 6 months worth of expenses in savings (she lives at home so this shouldn’t be a problem) you can discuss moving in together."
171,"After 16 years you don't 'take a break', you just break up. 16 years is plenty long enough to see the forest for the trees. You guys aren't young adults whose lives are diverging for the sake of career, schooling, etc. You are grown adults who have been together almost two decades and should know everything that needs to be known by now. 

What he did was some weak tea. He took a break instead of breaking up, he lied to you and downloaded a dating app. 

I'm so sorry for what you're going through."
172,Trust your gut. You did the right thing.
173,"Is he from a different cultural background?  I have never heard of anyone western saying ""wives don't behave this way"" about going to a concert.  Who does he think goes   Also, if he'd like to meet one, hi! I'm old, married, and I go to concerts both with and without my husband.  If I'm going to something without him, he may have some general safety concerns (that we then discuss and work out), but he would never dream of outright banning me from going.

&amp;#x200B;

It's also hugely troubling that he won't even talk about it.  I would go, and if he's mad, that's on him to work out since he won't offer any kind of compromise or solution.  I feel like this is him testing whether he can control you, and trying to get you used to a ""his way or the highway"" way of doing things."
174,"&gt;&gt;""I shouldnt have to ask you more than once to do something so of course I got mad and I have every right to be mad"".

This is an abusive statement, OP. His mindset is that he is the boss, he gets to order your behavior, you have to comply, and if you don't, he is totally within his rights to yell and swear at you. Lundy Bancroft, Why does he do that? -- please read it."
175,"There have been posts here where the person who 'knew better' ended up killing someone.  I've also read posts here where emergency care wasn't called because the male partner didn't think it serious, despite their female partner being in agony and/or incapacitated.  

After something like this?  I think the OP needs to very carefully decide if trust can be rebuilt.

u/Stolen_meds I know you love your boyfriend but his actions cannot be safely minimized.  He arbitrarily decided to withhold medical treatment.  He watched you suffer so he could be right.  This is pretty chilling.  The problem is whether what happened is part of something larger.

Maybe he won't hide your migraine medication but what about something else?  

It doesn't even need to be medically related, although u/wemblewobble is completely correct about those.  Think of all the decisions that couples make together.  Careers, lifestyle, finances, where they live, children, retirement etc.  Will he really listen to you and take on your opinion?  Especially if you have experience in something he doesn't?  Or will he know better?

OP, take some time to really think about this relationship.  Have there been other incidents where he has doubted either you or others?  Where he values his opinion over taking a moment to fact check?  This will tell you a lot about whether you can rebuild trust with him.

Also put some thought into how to rebuild trust if you do stay with him.  Therapy together?  To be honest... I think most people would find it difficult to do given the circumstances."
176,"&gt;we’d always agreed we weren’t going to last forever and we take it Day by day.

Hmm. You lived together for a year, then he moved out, then you had the above conversation? It's like your relationship is moving in reverse, like you're breaking up in installments. Are you two still exclusive? I wonder if you are both on the same page when it comes to this relationship.

You're not crazy. The fact that he stayed out all night would worry me too. Does he know you get notifications from his security system? Ask him what's going on:

""Hey boyfriend, I still get notifications from your security system. I noticed you've been out all night, and that's not like you. Everything okay? Do I have anything to worry about?"""
177,"This. Family is fucking overrated, especially these days."
178,"You're asking for convenience services, but what you *want* is more time together as a family.


Maybe change the tone of the requests: start expressing your dissatisfaction with how little time you have together and as a family, and start really pushing him to make changes that allow that to happen. He can come to the conclusion of how to make those changes himself. 


Right now he thinks this is a problem surrounding a housekeeper, but it's not. It's a problem about the intimacy and bonds of your marriage starting to be quietly and gradually undermined by the lack of time and prioritization of the marriage. Framing it as such might help him understand."
179,"I disagree. Facebook is never the answer to any reasonable adult’s problems.

She was told her presence was not welcome - so she left. What reason does she have to apologize to the cousins? It was not their event or the brides sister’s. None of them know why bride acted the way she did and it’s no longer their business. 

Hitting them up on FB would be seen as an attempt to fish for info/garner sympathy/look like the “bigger person” to people who have absolutely nothing to do with the situation. Everyone is just as clueless as OP but it’s really none of their business outside of the awkward start to the wedding reception. 

If the bride is too chicken shit to explain why OP is no longer welcome in her life there is nothing OP can do but move on completely and cut ties with the entire family. Trying to recoup her hotel costs and rehash the incident on FB is not a healthy use of her time."
180,"I have to side with your friend. While he may not repeat this specific stunt again, but what other kind crap would he pull because he doesn’t think that you know any better."
181,"If you’re still living with them, it’s time to move out. They will hinder your professional life by always interfering. Once you move out, you don’t need to let them know what trips you’ll be on."
182,"Kids come first.   
Kids come first.  
Kids come first."
183,Did you not discuss any of this before getting married together? It's clear IMO that your husband will not be able to prioritize your marriage and family together over his parents. Do with that information what you will.
184,"Why in christ’s name would you put up with this? Wow. And now he’s going to start freeloading. He sounds like a petulant child, not a partner."
185,"Maybe he can tell him just that.
You're as wanted at my concert as much as i was wanted by you after mum died.
If the father feels rejected, maybe this will give him clarity to reflect on his selfish behaviour &amp; empathise how much more a young boy would feel, having his umbilicus to the world severed, &amp; the only possible support link he needed virtually tossing him to the nearest relative so he didn't have to deal with him. 

Sometimes ~ having your behaviour reflected back at you is the wake up call you need, because this poor guy needed more than a few dollars now &amp; again, he needed his dad."
186,"&gt; and I feel so much guilt for not allowing him to see my cat. 

Your cat, I guarantee, does not give a flying fuck. And that’s the only opinion that matters."
187,"Yeah, I think would have. 

It's a terrible thought to have, but if it had been any of my other friends from high school, I would have been distraught too."
188,"Mentioning to her that he is going to take a nap is basically the prep for the ""i slept through the alarm"" excuse.

I promise you, he just didn't want to spend time with your family.

How will you know? If it was truly a mistake, he will be apologetic and understand that his behavior was upsetting. If he planned it, he is going to be angry at you if you mention how it made you feel."
189,"Agreed. OP should not be leaving her belongings in a friend's dorm anyway. Generally dorms are cramped to begin with, let alone having an extra person (who is not contributing to rent) sleep there regularly, on top of that OP leaves her belongings there? This problem is easily solved if OP takes some initiative."
190,"I would just recommend that you don't interact much for a little while, you have to learn how to live without each other. Find some hobbies to take your mind off of her, talk to your close friends. It's going to be hard, but it's good that it ended well!

I'm actually in a similar boat. I don't think I'd declare us co-dependent, but distance is kicking our asses and I'm hoping it's not the beginning of the end."
191,Tell them if they are upset to take it up with Grandma
192,"The fact that she went around this the way she did tells me that she really doesn't have a ""good enough"" reason to uninvite you. Most likely the real reason makes her look bad so she went around making these lies. Maybe you are more beatiful than she and she resents that? Maybe you got more attention than she back in uni and in her mind she doesn't want anyone to upstage her in her great day? In any case, this is on her and there is no reason to treat anyone like this. No matter what her motives are, I would not have anything to do with her anymore."
193,"Your MIL has conditioned your husband to allow her to get away with crappy behaviour. She needs boundaries set by your husband that it's your way or the highway. You are the parents and you get to decide together about anything to do with your child.

It may mean a period of no contact if she doesn't respect your wishes. She uses guilt and manipulation to make your husband feel bad because that's what she's always done and it's worked."
194,Why did you get back together with him?
195,"My son was like this. We moved after he graduated high school because we couldn't afford to stay where we were. He knew for almost a year that we were moving and I told him he should get a part time job so he can save up money to possibly get an apartment and stay in the town we were in. I knew he would be miserable in the small town 2 hours away that we were moving to. He didn't get a job. 

So he had to move with us. He hated it, as I knew he would. But he refused to get a job and save up to move. He just complained that he was unhappy.

I finally sat him down and told him he wasn't allowed to complain to me anymore until he had a plan of action. So you don't like living here? What are you going to do to change that? You don't like the car you drive? What are you going to do to change that? Sleep to much and don't like that? What are you going to do to change that?

It's okay to be stressed and being an adult sucks. But if he hates his job, what is he doing to change that? Is he looking for something else? Missed the bus? What is he doing to change that? Perhaps he needs to get up earlier.

When he starts to complain ask him... okay, so what can we do to change that? There is a problem, let's find a solution.

If he can't do that he should see a therapist. Perhaps he should anyway. 

Good luck."
196,"Just tell her. If your hair is the breaking point of the relationship, then she was with you for the wrong reasons. You may be young now but give it some time and there will be more and more balding guys around you. It's not like women are leaving their men left and right when they start to lose hair."
197,Pack up all of your clothes and start making the commute.  35 minutes isn’t that big a deal.  I drove over an hour every day to get to school.
198,"This, OP. Every relationship is different. Don't make a decision for him. He is responsible for his part of the relationship - just respect his decision if he declines."
199,"We've talked with my in laws about Candy's various behavior several times and it doesn't do much good. They do what she suggests because they don't care either way themselves and it makes Candy happy. 

Candy is manipulative over them to such an extent that they routinely favor Candy over their own daughter (my wife). As an example, I only half-jokingly told Joe and Candy to ""get a room"" when they were making out an an event we all attended. Rather than agreeing with my sentiment that their behavior was inappropriate in that situation, my father in law turned to Joe and Candy, gestured toward my wife and I, and said ""They're just jealous."" I was floored. First, because there's nothing to be jealous of. My wife and I have a great relationship and her father knows it. We can make out in public too - we just choose not to do so because we're not ignorant that way. Second, and more importantly, I don't get how he can insult his own daughter like that, implying she's jealous of that kind of behavior when he knows better.

Anyway, my in laws entire lives are built around avoiding conflict, and this isn't just with Candy because I've heard stories of how far they will go with others in the same regard. Just let things go, they say. God will deal with people, they say. Let those people dig their own graves, they say. 

If that works for them, good for them. But it isn't working for us here, and they know it, but they care more about their own peacekeeping than resolving it. My mother in law wants it resolved, but she's done all she will ever do to make that happen."
200,"I think escalation is a fair concern and a simple “sorry, dad, we have to work and won’t be able to attend” would be the simplest answer. “I’ll let you know when we’re available”

203,"Why wait until you’re “there” which means what, crisis mode? You’re posting on Reddit so things are already pretty hard for you. Counseling can prevent things getting worse."
204,Let him go. He's not a real friend if this is how he acts. This is manipulative as shit. You have a man.  It's understandable that he needs space to get over you but this is now how an adult should handle that at all.
205,"I should really, I'm a very non-confrontational person so it's hard to ask awkward questions. It would give me a clear answer though."
206,"Your poor sister, she's made so much of herself with a successful business and you have hurt her in one of the most profound ways. Illiteracy is a real and crippling problem for people and causes so much shame, anxiety and low self-esteem. Here she is, rising above all that, and you tore her down. 

Here's what you need to do:

1. Do your research on adult illiteracy and learning difficulties. Learn what you can do to support her going forward. Talk to advocates or non-profits if you need more resources, or your public library. You need to show that you are serious about being an ally and the first step is to educate yourself. 
2. Apologize profusely, for the shame you placed on her as kids and for your pigheaded interrogative and insensitive questions now. You take ownership of this, do not place any blame at her feet for her literacy problems.  Acknowledge that you failed her but that you want to do right by her going forward.
3. If she's receptive, tell her that you would like to support her, if that's her wish, in finding adult literacy groups and show her willingness to work with her. If she enrolls into a program, be present and help her with reading assignments. 

Illiteracy is so very stigmatized and it's such an unseen problem. People with literacy issues find all sorts of ways to cope, but she really does need to get up to a functional level as it could have severe consequences for her health, her business, and her adaptability. You were so very lucky that you got to go to college, she never had that chance if she has been struggling with her literacy all these years, but she has proven herself to be so resourceful and clever just by learning how to run a business on her own. She's probably worked harder than you'll ever know and she should be praised, encouraged and supported."

*holy shit*"
208,No you are right. The worry would eat me up
209,"I can't believe they timed their arrival to coincide with the induction **without telling her**!

OP, did your husband, *seriously* invite his parents to be houseguests, without telling you--the person who was undergoing the medical procedure?

Wtaf?

OP if you want permission to stop being a doormat, I grant it to you. I believe the phrase you will want to introduce is ""either you deal your mother and ensure our boundaries are respected, or **I** will deal with her how I see fit""

I'd say it's way too soon to be planning a trip back. Guaranteed as soon as you hear her voice your going to get annoyed. Seeing her hold your baby is going to be infuriating. Every little thing she does--you are going to scrutinize for malicious intent (warranted or not). 
It's 100% going to make this worse (trust me--Ive been where you are minus the NICU stay).  You have to heal. You have to tell your husband that you are still angry and sad about what happened. You'll never get your baby's birth announcement back. You'll never get the golden hour with your husband and newborn back. You need to come to terms and let it go before you invite her back into your home. She inserted herself into some intimate family moments without care or concern and you shouldn't provide her with another opportunity until you feel you are up to it. Ask him to come to marriage counseling to help you work through it. 

If you don't do therapy and you let her come as planned then try to make them stay in a hotel. Try to keep them at arm's length. If they have to stay with you, get a rubber door stopper and take breaks. If you are breastfeeding I would retreat and lock yourself in the nursery when you are nursing so you can get a break. Get into baby wearing and wear the baby as much as possible. Allow her to hold the baby on *your* terms. **A PARENT CANNOT HOG THEIR INFANT** so don't let anyone guilt trip you into thinking otherwise. Make it abundantly clear to your husband that you will not be pacifying his parents, not will you or the baby be sacrificial lambs for him getting their approval. When she is holding kiddo, take advantage of the chance to take a shower, get your hair done, do any self care you need. Talk through with your husband exactly what he should do to show he is on the same team with you (e.g. if baby is crying and she isn't giving baby back, he should intervene. If she walks out of the room with the baby he should redirect her, if she's not being helpful he should ask her to do something specific like make dinner or do dishes, if she is doing the annoying ""criticize mom via baby talk"" he should shut that down). 

If you want to confront her, or if she confronts you, by all means, be honest: ""Karen, I still cannot believe you thought it was appropriate the way you behaved when I was in the hospital. I will not rugsweep your actions. You have not apologized or made any genuine attempt at reconciliation with me. So I am not happy with you. I love your son. I will not stand in the way of your relationship with him. I will do my best to facilitate a *healthy* relationship between you and [kiddo] but do not mistake civility and manners for affection or friendship. I would like for us to have a better relationship, but I am still hurt by your actions and until you make a genuine, remorseful apology healing and reconciliation is not going to happen""."
210,"Stoo thinking in phrases like ""love of my life."" She's not. You will have other loves, different kinds of loves, and all of them will be loves of your life.

It's hard to see past this at your age. Most of us older folk {I'm 47F} have a similar story, though, or 5. I didn't get out of bed for two weeks after one long distance relationship, and I wouldn't believe my parents when they said it will get better.

Hang out with friends. Watch movies that make you cry and laugh. Get outside in the sun and just look around without thinking anything.

I think you're going to be fine. Save this post somewhere to look at years from now.

And i have to be honest... It took me the entire time it took writing this post to remember said boyfriend's name. (hi, Eric!) 

The 28 years since we broke up both informed the rest of my dating life and have been totally eclipsed by it."
211,Given the limited time y’all have together I can see you wanting his attention over a game. I can also see that if y’all have spent all day together he may need a game to destress/relax from a busy day. I can see both sides depending on the context of the day and also agree he can do most gaming without you unless y’all have something you ca play together.
212,"&gt;Anyway, my in laws entire lives are built around avoiding conflict

Well, it's clear where Joe gets his passivity from.

It's time for you and your wife to fight fire with fire: Start making plans that exclude Candy and Joe, but don't give any heads up so she can interrupt.

* Drive over to your in-laws and pick them up for dinner at your place. Do it a random weeknight.

* Make birthday plans for your wife one week beforehand, grab the in-laws and do a day trip (drive out to wine country for a tasting plus lunch or dinner, etc)

* Celebrate your in-laws' birthday before or after the actual day.

* Hell yes, post pictures after the fact on social media

I would also look for ways to contact Joe which Candy can't control: drop off a ""thinking of you"" card at his office, text him on messenger, etc. Have your wife reiterate to Candy ""He's been my brother longer than you've been his wife. You cannot dictate my relationship with my blood. You don't control me; stay in your lane.""

She will eventually do another blow up that shows how crazy she is. Maybe eventually her tantrums will be enough to wake Joe out of the fog. She is a toxic person and you shouldn't give into any of her demands."
213,"Why would you go through with this wedding? Everyone is warning you and you are going through with it despite knowing yourself that things are ruined. He can’t even take responsibility for what he did. You are making the biggest mistake of your life and you will regret marrying him, id bet my life on it"
214,"I'm just going to say that my abusive ex used to tell me that he forgave me for cheating on him (even though I never actually cheated or even came close to it) not only as a way to gaslight me, but also to get the upper hand in arguments by painting me as the bad-guy who cheated on him while he was just this poor saint who tolerated me and forgave me even though I didn't deserve it."
215,"He is trying to be protective of his daughter, but he’s going about it the wrong way. A 6 year old should not be living in building with students and young professionals. The way to protect her from the PG-13 behavior is to love somewhere kid-friendly. That is his job as a parent. He can’t move into a new environment and try to change it to suit his preferences.

Also, you taking them in and sharing a bedroom with her dad definitely makes you more than her dad’s good friend! He’s in denial if he thinks this is taking it slow. You’re entering stepmother territory."
216,"Your SO doesn't respect you.  Don't play the pick me game.  Will you ever feel secure if he does pick you?  He was walking a very close line and then threw the break card so he could sleep with someone else.  Let's say what he's waiting for is to see if she wants him.  Do you really want to be someone seconds?  

I know you love him, but you need to have the respect for yourself to not allow the people you love to treat you like a doormat.  Be someone's clear first choice.  As much as you hope, he isn't going to wake up and decide - within a time frame that's going to matter - that you were just the one for him all along.  He felt so little about your relationship, he left you for someone else.  

What you know is he has decided.  He has decided that whatever relationship he had with you, he was willing and able to torch it on the chance it works with someone else.  Find someone who would never even consider that as a choice."
217,"&gt;I didn’t really get any answers as to why I wasn’t a part of this


Well I mean, you kinda did. He wants to do his thing with two women he knows you’re uncomfortable with, kinda in a secret way but not really because fuck your feelings. Then he uses threats and manipulation to twist your arm to do exactly what he wants you to do. Cut your losses here and find a real, loving, kind, mature partner who values you. Don’t waste your youth on this"
218,"I’d reach out to her and say something like, “Hey! Hope everything is going well! I just wanted to check in with you because I didn’t get a wedding invite and I wasn’t sure if it had maybe gotten lost? But I understand if things have changed and you guys had to cut down the list, just wanted to make sure I wasn’t missing anything!” 

Invites do get lost. Spreadsheets get screwed up (I forgot to add someone on my online RSVP list so that person got an invite, went to RSVP, and couldn’t. Oops.). 

Also, contrary to what most people posted here, I don’t think it was completely out of line to ask if you had a plus one, especially if you only know the bride/groom. It’s actually standard to give a +1 to people who won’t know anyone else/will know very few people. 

And if it makes you feel better, my cousin (who did not get a +1) texted me and asked “hey, how do I change my RSVP to include a +1” — your ask was waaaay less entitled/presumptuous haha."
219,"Oof. Reminds me of a couple I know. Her and her husband are so socially awkward that they have trouble making friends, so they latch onto any small kindness/polite response as a sign you’re eager to be their friend. What I’ve found helps:

1. Never, ever give a “maybe” in response to getting together. It will only make the person try harder because “maybe” gives hope it will turn into a “yes”.
2. Don’t provide an excuse as to why you’re saying no. “No thank you,” “it’s kind of you to invite me, but I’ll have to pass,” etc.
3. Be polite, but firm. 

Best of luck!"
220,"Honestly I feel like this was so avoidable. The moment you noticed that this partner was not doing her fair share of work, you should have spoken to your professor. 

But you waited until you finished all the work, presented, THEN you wen’t to your professor. Theres nothing she can do for you now. You’re grade will be a reflection of all this nonsense.

In regards to school work, throw anyone under the bus, this is YOUR career, YOUR grade, YOUR tuition money, don’t let others drag you down like this. If partners do not show interest/initiative/drive to get a good grade, difficulty meeting up, doesn’t respond to communications about work...you HAVE to tell the professor."
221,Thanks for the reply. Yes I know I should tell her and I will but I’m sure its going to start a drama. She deserves the truth though
222,"You are really being the bigger person here. It absolutely sucks to realize that someone doesn’t value your friendship as much as you did theirs, but you’re 100% right that it’s a reflection on her, not you. Great job handling this!"
223,Yes! I don’t see why OP and his wife can’t go out to dinner alone with her parents. Why do Candy and Joe always have to be included? This whole situation is so nuts.
224,"1. You urged GF to see a doctor before starting diet. Mom and GF both ignore your advice.
2. GF doesn't see doctor, starts diet anyway. You responsibly suggest going to the hospital when things turn south. Mom ignores your advice until things get much worse.
3. Mom ignores all the previous things you had said, blames you for all the resulting problems that were a result of *her* negligence. Mom suggests you should be beaten when you stand up for yourself.

OP, this should be a real eye-opener for you. Is this really the kind of person you want in your life? She's your GF's mother, she isn't going anywhere. Just hop on over to /r/justnomil if you want a forecast of the life you could be heading toward.

I would never, *ever* speak to, help, or otherwise assist someone who spoke to me like GF's mom did to you. She owes you an apology, at the very least. Your GF and her mother are responsible for how this scenario played out, and they need to own it. Even with two minutes of Google searching, I was able to learn that Keto + T1 diabetes is risky and requires *very* careful management."
225,The false intimacy reminds me a lot of *love bombing*.
226,"I would let him go, but not take him back after he is done having sex with other women. If he was truly happy with you, I don't think he would want to date and be intimate with other people."
227,"Your girlfriend is cray cray and you are going to end up with a sexual assault charge if you don't get out of this. You shouldn't be having ""lots of issues"" only six months in, and the behavior you describe is unstable and concerning."
228,"The reaction of the sister to all of this clearly tells me that she knows ""Bride"" isn't quite alright. If she were to think her sister is completely normal, wouldn't she have immediately and strongly assumed YOU'RE the one full of shi*? 

Good judge of character or not, usually you'd side with your sister above all else. She didn't, so I bet this isn't any new behaviour."
229,"Thanks everyone for the kind words and advice. Have felt so low since this happened about 6 hours ago. Ì appreciate all your responses so much, as it has helped me with perspective rather than thinking about the urges to do something stupid. Much love kind internet strangers"
230,"Consider this a bullet dodged. He's 29? What other life-altering events will he make all about himself if the two of you remain together? If he wants to make you the heavy here for ending the relationship, then own it; tell him you can't be with someone as selfish as him that would take a family catastrophe and try to minimize it because he is temporarily inconvenienced. Count yourself lucky that you haven't wasted more time on this child in a man's body."
231,"I usually like to clean up and make sure my embarrassing stuff is put away before people stay at my place. Maybe she's frustrated that she didn't even have an opportunity to do that. I also don't like people staying in my space without knowing about it beforehand. I'd have no problem with the situation if I knew in advance, but I'd be upset if I felt like it were sprung on me. She's probably extra frustrated since she's on vacation and you can't deal with it face to face. Moving forward, just try to talk beforehand, and it'll probably be fine."
232,This is a great point.  When the boss finds out the family is coming on every trip he's going to seriously rethink why he hired OP to start with and her great career potential will be gone.
233,"Honestly I didn't put this im my post because I think this word flags posts for removal. But several times, we left because someone there was very likely a r*pist, or a part of a group that we've heard gets r*pey at parties they host.

Nothing's going to make us wanna stick around when that's the case. Maybe there's no problem yet, but we don't want to stick around and find out."
234,"He is after her. He is a definite threat. It was an unprovoked written attack which included a specific threat to your marriage.

This guy is a pro, he already knows your wife is somewhat interested (or more) and he has contacted you in this way as he knows how it will play out (as it has) and how that will serve to push her towards him.

The trick now is to be cool and calm about this. Make your point again calmly that his reaction to you is a massive over stepping of boundaries and that her reaction is not one of a supportive and loving spouse. Then leave it be, don't threaten and don't make demands at this stage. She is a grown woman and should know how to behave in this situation.

Watch the situation closely and be prepared for this to go south. Go see a lawyer quietly to make sure you know your position just in case.

Give yourself a set period for her to sort this out. After that period has elapsed, if the situation is not resolved say that you expect for her to come to counselling to resolve this issue as you are not sure about how you feel about her anymore because of her disrespect and lack of support. Hopefully that may put the rocket up her. If not the counselling may help or at least allow you to move to a separation more easily.

If she decides to escalate things during your evaluation period then don't hesitate to kick her out (if you can) or even serve her papers (as you will already now the position from your consult with the lawyer).

Sorry this sounds grim, but these situations are serious and have all the hallmarks of a woman on the verge of having an affair."
235,"I don't blame you for being wary - not telling you where the venue, no invitation and not even noticing or saying anything as you pull back on the friendship at work seems to point towards you possibly being more invested in the friendship than she was. How does she usually react to confrontation or awkward situations? My one bit of advice would be to keep in mind that you'll have to work with her after all of this, if you think she'd react badly to you even asking then proceed with caution."
236,"My now ex-BIL is 6 years older than me.  When he and my sister were still married, he was very much an older brother to me, and sometimes I went to him for advice or venting when I was your age, since he was aware that my family simply viewed me a lens of ""baby sister"" and hadn't noticed I'd grown up to be a fully-functioning adult, so he tended to give me better advice (or at least advice without dismissing me as if I was a 6 year old). Know what he never did?  KISS ME.

Tell your sister.  That is not normal BIL behaviour."
237,"Report him to HR just for the paper trail, OP, on your way out. And if you work in the industry I suspect you work in, consider reporting him to the bar as well."
238,"He wants you as the fall back girl,plan B in other words. Don’t ever be anyone’s plan B."
239,"I'll admit to some bias here, but I'm concerned that maybe if he's a 30yo dating a 23yo, he's probably immature, and that would be an issue. I think there is further evidence for this in that he feels stable enough to buy a motorcycle but not stable enough to settle down with someone he claims to want to settle down with. 

It seems like he doesn't want to take the next step with you. He's probably grown comfortable with the way things are now."
240,"&gt; he said he will try to stop when we get married

So you went into this marriage knowing full well that he can't set boundaries with his parents. At this point, I think you guys need couples counseling. I don't see this marriage surviving if you guys can't get on the same page regarding his parents."
241,"I can only speak for myself, but I will just say that if I was on a first date with a woman and she asked me about things that seemed to be aimed at getting an idea of my ""financial situation,"" my gold digger alarm would be going off big time and that might well be enough in and of itself to make me not want a second date. I understand that it's important to you, but it's not an appropriate topic of discussion until you get to know someone better."
242,"He's putting too much emotional labour on you, and honestly it's not healthy to have one person as the only outlet for your emotional problems, especially when he clearly has such a low threshold for stress. He needs to start figuring out ways to deal with stress other than talking to you. Maybe have a conversation with him about what makes him feel better after a tough day - maybe having a cup of tea and watching a movie after work or going for a walk, just something to redirect his complaining towards. He should definitely try to work on getting more friends - building a support network outside of your relationship is just a very healthy thing to do. 

When you next confront him about it, try to frame it as you guys working on this together to make him stronger and happier rather than framing it as him needing to change for you. I think it'd be very easy for him to get defensive over this, but clearly it's important for things to change for the sake of both of your mental health. Be positive and affirming, but let him know that this is very serious and therapy might have to become a solution if he continues to put his emotional labour onto you alone."
243,"I don’t get these posts. 


“My relationship is a flaming dumpster fire of odious excrement. Am I overreacting when I ask to be treated with a basic level of decency?”


Jesus Christ. OP, he’s gots to go. Talk to a therapist because your baseline is way off."
244,"Of this whole thing, what bothers me the most is his blatant disrespect of your feelings. You are thinking of marriage and being with this person forever, do you really think it's such a good idea with someone who doesn't care at all about the boundaries you both have agreed on?"
245,"I am a man but this advice comes from my mother, who is a pretty successful business woman. 

« If your voice is not heard specifically on sexist topics, you need to blow up before it escalated into something more serious and hurtful ». 
Basically, next time he behaves inappropriately, scream at him. Your friend group need to fully be aware so that they have no choice BUT to take a side. Every time he tries to make an innuendo , call him on that and say it as loudly as possible , make fun of the situation and insist that you are not interested in him at all, that you prefer James. 

My mother worked in a bank (now she is the general affairs director) and she had an issue with sexual harassment at work. She tried to talk with HR but they could not really do anything about it. One of her female boss advised her to blow up, cry in the middle of the workplace and make as much noise as possible. So that’s what she did. As soon as she heard her boss say : « you are dressing sexy for me again? » she basically threw a tantrum. She screamed and made it known in the workplace that she was sexually harassed, that this pig was threatening her etc. The other employees had to take side and they stood with her (+ a few other employees supported her claim as they were harassed as well) , HR had to intervene and in the end fire him. No one ever tried to mess with her again."
246,"&gt; Yeah, I think would have. 

Of course you would have. 

&gt; It was the first time I'd been faced with the death of someone my age.  

For me, this happened when I was in high school and the person who died was, in fact, an ex. After an immature breakup, we weren't close but I still cared about him. He was hit by a car. I ugly cried the whole week for a whole bunch of reasons that had nothing to do with the fact that we were previously romantic. All of us spent that week (and the funeral) crying about it. Dealing with the death of someone who's young is extremely difficult because it makes you realize how quickly things can end for you, or for anyone you know. It's jarring. 

The fact that you feel like you have to explain yourself (and your crying) is honestly terrible. 

&gt; He commented on how I didn't cry like that when we almost broke up before going long distance,  

Like, what? how is this even comparable to SOMEONE DYING. I wish I had better advice but I just wanted to reiterate that the way you're processing the death of your friend is completely normal. You don't deserve to have to coddle your boyfriends insecurities on top of it all..."
247,"&gt;I don't know what to do anymore.

I think you know exactly what you need to do at this point. He lies to you, conceals finances from you, you said he lost his job over this. He's an addict pure and simple. He gets into a treatment program and *works it* with all intention of stopping or you leave him. Those are the only reactions that make any sense."
248,"Girl he just wants to keep living off your money while living the single life with his buddies. He doesn’t want to give up the cushy parts of dating you but he DOES want to dial back any obligations he feels like he owes a live-in partner. 

You should probably kick him to the curb. But if you’re not ready yet, you tell him that he is in no way obligated to live with you, and in fact you’d prefer he didn’t - but that means that the perks of living with you are no longer available. He is no longer a member of your household, so you will no longer treat him like one. That means giving up his key and taking over his own bills."
249,"Tell him you wouldn't want it to ""destroy your band""."
250,"Throw him a conception day party. 

Seriously. 

I overheard these two women in Walmart when I was twelve or so. It seems that one woman's husband was born really close to Christmas. So close that he's never really been able to celebrate *his* birthday.

So on his birthday in March or whatever she threw him a conception day party. Balloons, cake, gifts, guests. The whole thing.

Because it was still *his* day, but not his *actual* day he had no preconceived (heh) notions about it, had fun, wife got lots of brownie points. She said they do it every year now.

The other woman thought it was brilliant and so did I. Obviously. Because I still remember that conversation almost three decades later! (It may help that my birthday is at the beginning of December, so I understand some about getting lost in Christmas)"
251,"I’m a veteran that has yet to use my VA loan. Me and wife are hoping to use it within a few years.

There is no way in hell I would co-sign on a mortgage to let someone use MY hard earned VA loan. (I wouldn’t co-sign someones mortgage no matter what anyway).

Also Whoever would ask a veteran that is a selfish asshole that doesn’t understand how hard being in the military actually is. Screw them. You did the right thing, don’t feel guilty."
252,"&gt; It's a embarrassing at work.

It's more than embarrassing, it's going to eventually get you fired. No employer wants an employee that can't be an individual and show enough maturity that they can't be alone without their parents. You need to make plans to move out and become independent on your own."
253,"This is gross af and would 100% be a dealbreaker to me. At the very least, stop sleeping with him (if you are) for your own health. You can get vaginal infections from sleeping with someone so unhygienic. 

He doesn't care and you can't make him care if he doesn't want to. Is his lack of hygiene a dealbreaker for you?"
254,"Update: I took video of him last night and told him “we need to have a talk”. He felt bad and said “I didn’t know it was that bad, maybe we should go see a doctor.” I told him that was all fine and dandy but I needed my own bed before I end up on Snapped.  He said he felt bad and would be setting up the bed this week."
255,"&gt;...  I'm fairly confident that if I do forgive this it'll never happen again. 

You're bordering on delusional. This isn't just about your migraines, this is about him thinking he knows what's best for you *more than you and your doctors do.* He listened to everything you had to say about your condition and how it affects you and he decided that he's smarter than you. And he risked causing you a significant amount of pain so he could say I told you so. What does that tell you about how he values you?

Get rid of him before he decides to get weirdly controlling in other ways."
256,Anytime I feel like “finding my own happiness” I go for a weekend hiking trip with my girlfriends. Gives me time to remember what my own interests and likes are. I tend to sacrifice my wants and needs in a relationship to make the other person happy. I know it’s not healthy and also pretty draining. This little get away reminds me how much I love my SO and makes me realize that you need to be your own happiness
257,"Yeah it sounds like a strategy George Cosanza came up with.

""You didn't book the flight?""

""She ended up booking it herself Jerry!""

""So, what's your next move?""

""I'm going to do absolutely nothing for her birthday..  and then order food she doesn't like""

""If this doesn't do it then I don't want to know your next move"""
258,"No, you can't ""always"" be there to warn girls.

But you can warn this specific girl. If he puts her in the hospital or kills her, how are you going to feel?"
259,"Judging from your past posts, you've been through some rocky times with your girlfriend.

If this sort of petty back and forth is a constant issue, you have to have that conversation. If you're considering her as a 'life partner,' you have to be comfortable bringing up contentious issues and you both have to learn to work together to get past them.

Schedule a time when you next see one another to bring up this issue. Tell her you really care about her and aren't happy with the way you *both* communicate sometimes and want to learn how to fix it. It's not about making her feel bad for being passive-aggressive or calling her immature, it's about finding a way you both can feel better about communication and what you both need.

If you don't think you can work together on it to improve, you may have to reconsider the long term viability of this relationship."
260,"Hey Girl - friendship is Yin and Yang - it's ok to spend time with Jane but also be looking for other friendships that are a better fit for you. Maybe you could find somewhere to volunteer. I've found volunteering to be the BEST thing for my own personal development especially as an introvert. It gives me connection and support to those in my community, gives me something to talk about with others, a place and time and events to look forward to. I've also found a book club which has been really great as well. Best of luck!"
261,"Yes!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Tell each of them, I'm going to call the police unless SOME money is in X place. Have X place be different for every single person. If the money shows up in a certain place, you'll know who took it."

263,"It sounds like you want permission to prioritize your child’s safety over your sister’s privacy. I don’t see anything wrong with that. If you are so close, she should trust your judgment."
264,"""I can't stand my husband"" IS a big thing, and you should be at least considering divorce! I think he needs to know that you are seriously contemplating divorce because of how bad things have gotten. Maybe it will motivate him to go to marital counseling if he knows there could be consequences for not working on the relationship."
265,Don’t marry and/or have children with someone who is still being controlled by their mommy.

267,He still sees you guys as babies. My sister is 11 years younger than me and I tend to do this kind of stuff to her. I try to stop but it's like this weird instinct. Did he have to watch you guys a lot when you were all younger or did you guys have a tough childhood that would explain a lot as well.
268,This. He will never stop using that against you.

270,"Listen. I know Rachel has obtained success in her career and shes pretty and shit. But none of that means anything when shes still a nasty, immature, petty, evil person. You think someone like her can truly love anyone? Have healthy relationships? Feel happy without tearing someone else down? She cant.

YOU, on the other hand, survived her torment. You even went to therapy and bettered yourself afterwards. You're happy and content with your life even though it would have been easy to fall into despair.

You've already won this. Dont pay her any mind. Block her and stop checking in on her social media.

Stay strong, lovely."
271,"I'm so sorry, OP, but you've all created a monster. What adult actually thinks she can tell another adult to stay away from their own parents? What sort of Twilight Zone shit is this? 

The only way to fix it now is to have zero tolerance for her bullshit. You and your wife can't control the rest of her family, but with the behavior Candy exhibits I'm sure they'd eventually get sick of it as well. Especially seeing someone else, you two, not putting up with her."
272,"Well, I hate to suggest an old r/relationships stand-by, but have you tried telling him that you are trying but his bad mood makes everybody miserable? Like, bluntly, exactly that. 

&amp;#x200B;

If it were me, I would give it one more year. I'd tell him: ""Hubs, I know your birthday has some bad memories attached to it, but I'm doing my best to help you make some new good birthday memories. Frankly, every year, you are so miserable and such a downer that it makes everyone uncomfortable and unhappy. You don't even thank me for the effort. This year, I will try to plan something you will enjoy - but if you can't at least be civil/polite/grateful to me/the guests, I will not be planning any more birthday celebrations for you, because it seems through your behavior, that you would rather not celebrate."" and follow through."
273,Look up the term “grooming”. He might be trying to do that to you
274,"It shouldn't really be a question even if she wasn't in a relationship.

275,"""Husband, I'm experiencing a documented and scary health crisis. I need you to stop trying to control my medication. This is very scary for me, and I need you to listen to my concerns without brushing them off.""

It's completely inappropriate for him to try to assert whether or not you take meds. You are a couple, but your body does not belong to him. You need to take the meds prescribed by your doc, and hard stop him from having any influence over it -- he is lacking boundaries here. You should not be fighting in the middle of a migraine. Take your meds, detach from him, tell him you will discuss this later, and go lie down."
276,"Good. You're better off without him. 

Did you report this to the police?"
277,"&gt;It has happened at least once every week for the past two months.

Your husband is treading a well worn path and having a workplace affair.  He's fallen into the trap of consoling a lost/lonely soul and has become emotionally involved.  He may or may not be sleeping with his boss yet, but he has already violated his marriage vows emotionally and if he shut this down, it's just a matter of time.  

&gt; His irritation at my unhappiness is making me question 

He doesn't like to be reminded that he is violating his own moral values and has taken up with another woman

&gt;I'm at a loss as to how to handle the situation productively when he honestly seems to think there's nothing going on that should concern me.

Ask him to leave.  Tell him he can't be married to you and have a girlfriend on the side. Tell him that you've given him months to shut down his affair and it keeps escalating.   Do not accept promises to do better, tell him his promises are worthless and that you will be taking care of yourself from now on.

Then see a lawyer and have him served at work.   Do not suggest couples counseling -- the problem is not your marriage, it's his behavior.  If asks what he can do to save the marriage, tell him he has to start looking for another job immediately and get himself into counseling.

You (and he) may think this is extreme but you have to do it now if you want any chance of saving your marriage.  Half-measures will not work when someone is this out of control.

278,What I can’t fathom here is that you pay for all of the food with your own money. That’s an enormous financial burden on you!
279,"That's a weird outlook but I have seen it expressed by some more conservative people. Some people really believe you aren't ""actually"" a family until you have kids. I think that's crazy and also insulting to childless couples but it's what they believe.

Does your husband come from a more conservative family/background?"
280,What the fuck? This girl doesn't respect you at all. Yes you are being abused and it will not get better. Leave. She is a classic abuser.
281,"I don't know what country you're in right now, but what this guy is doing is stalking you, and it is a crime. 

I know you are hoping we can tell you of a kind way to let this guy down gently so he says ""okay, I understand, I'll stop."" But what he's doing is a crime. He KNOWS it's wrong, and that hasn't stopped him. You already talked to him, and he got defensive and dismissed your concerns. 
 
You need to think of your safety. Stalkers tend to escalate their behavior. Keep your door locked. Never leave a drink unattended around this guy. Call him out loudly in public if he won't leave you alone. Document EVERYTHING. 

Please take this seriously."
282,"He’s moving a whole other girl into his room...I can’t actually believe the balls on this guy. If my boyfriend pulled something like this, I would genuinely ask him if he’s lost his mind. I can’t even imagine he would display such poor judgement.

You say the girl has suggested in the past that he break up with you, doesn’t like his girlfriends, and now she’s manoeuvred herself into a position where he will most likely be partially supporting her since she’s jobless and can’t afford the rent? Come on. Neither of these people respect you or your relationship. This is going to be the first in a long line of headaches for you, the bedroom thing is just the first red flag."
283,"If she was a virgin shen you met her, but her ex made her orgasm, it sounds like you need to step up your outer stimulation game..."
284,"Please don't confuse being a woman interested in finance stigma with people generally being uncomfortable with talking about finances when they first meet you. Many people have been taught that finances are personal and shouldn't be a topic of polite conversation.  

So it sounds like you'd be interested in FIRE, and lucky you...there's an internet full of like minded people who get you!  Finding them in the wild might be a little harder though. 

Let's be honest, the discipline it takes to get where you are and want to be isn't going to be for everyone.  It's going to scare some people away but as they say...there's a lid for every pot.

 Be careful to not let finances and the pursuit of financial freedom become your self worth or the only thing you can think or speak of.

Don't let people get the idea that *all* you care about is money. What else are you passionate about?  

You can talk about it as you date for sure, but watch body language and cues if your date seems bored. Just because they are bored with the conversation, doesn't mean they aren't fiscally responsible.

You may have a harder time finding a partner who is just as serious. Look for networks of like minded people (events,meets-ups etc) to help you find a closer possible match. I'd focus more on building friendships and less on finding a lifelong match at this point. 


Dh totally geeks out to spreadsheets of our personal wealth, retirement savings, kids 529s etc. Talking about our budget/goals/and making plans has become one of my favorite weekend activities. Living largely debt free (still have mortgage)  and meeting our goals does mean some lifestyle sacrifices that not everyone is going to be game for.

Best wishes!"
285,I would have said the same. Just say “well I guess responding the way I did is just my personality.” It can’t go one way right? You didn’t start it. You finished it. It sounds like they are making it a bigger deal than it is.
286,"I think both of your approaches aren’t the best. I’d venture to guess that he’s correct when he says your yelling and anger aren’t helping anything.

But the silent treatment doesn’t help either.

Like I know that this is the cliché answer for this sub, but it might do your marriage some good to seek some couples counseling to both develop healthy ways of communication and working through problems together.

Look, this is the nitty gritty of relationship stuff. Poor or abusive communication around day to day things add up and resentment begins to fester.

Good luck to both of you, I wish you guys the best."
287,"This would be a horrible experience  for people who are chill with guests and strangers, let alone someone who's made it explicitly clear it's triggering for them. 

Your roommate fucked up. She might not have understood how serious you were about not wanting to be surprised by strangers or what you're reaction would be but once she realised she should 100% not have brushed it off. Sometimes our fuck ups have consequences far bigger than might be forseeable. Doesn't mean we shouldn't feel bad.  

I think a sit down chat when she gets in where you explain you were in fight or flight mode through no fault of your own is best to have here. A stain on a table/ wall is really no big deal in the scheme of things. 

Also tell your landlord communication need to come through BOTH of you in the future. But hopefully that's a lesson already learned"
288,"Well this is a mad one. Might as well tell him you know. Doesn't sound like you stand to hurt anyone, or out them in any way."
289,"Couple of thoughts. 

First, this is sexual abuse and harassment on the part of this guy. You'd be well within your rights to be bringing this to your Title IX office. If you're up for the work and rehashing of this incident that this would entail, then I say go for it. If you think you'd be happier and healthier moving on from this without going down that route, power to you as well. 

Secondly, your girlfriend's response to this is disturbing and borderline sexist/homophobic. Let's flip the roles a bit. If one of your GF's friends came to you, showed you nudes of your GF, and asked you to keep it ""in confidence"" - would you **ever** consider concealing your GF's sexual abuse / revenge porn from her? Would your GF **ever** forgive you for protecting the identity of someone who had nudes of her against her will? Would your GF find it even **remotely acceptable** for you to make the issue about you and not about the gross violation of your rights? 

Of course not. Your GF looks at this differently because she is either (1) an immature / bad person, or (2) views heterosexual relationships / sexual abuse of women differently than she does homosexual relationships / sexual abuse of men. Either one of those options should make you seriously reconsider whether you'd like to continue dating her. Her reaction to this situation is deeply, deeply fucked up and deserves more attention from you than you've given it in this post."
290,"&gt;  Am I in the wrong here? Should I be prioritising my sister above D no matter what, even when I feel like she's being unreasonable? 

OP.... you really need to face reality at this point. There's a reason your sister has basically no friends left. SHE's the issue. 

Whatever you do, do NOT enable her. Stop prioritising her needs over yours and simply call her out on her bs."
291,"When people cheat, not everyone tries very hard to hide it. Your husband is dating his boss in front of you."
292,"You just told your husband that you care more about where you live/stability than you do about him, and you're surprised that was hurtful? You've got some thinking to do about your communication."
293,"That's a good idea, it gives her space to make an excuse but I still get my answer"
294,"I think it's pretty normal for each parent to have special activities they do with the kids. My mom read me and my brother all of the Harry Potter books when we were growing up and it was a really wonderful bonding experience that I cherish to this day. You can have that with the kids even if she isn't interested in going. In fact, it might be a nice dynamic for you to get alone time with them every so often and let her have a day on her own to relax as well. I would talk to her about what she might want as a special activity with the kids so that you ensure you both get those pockets of bonding time."
295,Still you can ask and if it makes her feel uncomfortable -- good. It is tacky to hand deliver invitations at work when not everyone is being invited. That is a very poor way to handle company/business relationships.
296,"Seriously what's wrong with this woman.

She might try to change her ultimatum once she realizes you'll choose your kids first.
Don't let her. She's already proven herself cruel and selfish, don't get caught in a trap that might seem easier than splitting."
297,"Please please get a bank account.  You will always lose and get cash stolen, misplace it.  I learned the hard way also to never put all your eggs I'm om basket.  You learned from this,  this is something you will never forget.  Never trust anybody with your money.  Dont go telling anybody about where u hid your money or how much you have.  Good luck!"
298,"Why would her sister reveal any of this to you at the wedding itself?? Why not just quietly deal with the situation and get you a seat instead of potentially causing a spectacle?

Why would the bride openly admit she only did this elaborate child-free scam on the assumption that you wouldn’t get a babysitter in several months’ time — all to keep you from the wedding? Then the sister comes right back and tells you all this? Huh?

There are a lot of parts to this story that don’t add up."
299,"Does it matter whether you're the asshole or not? Regardless of right or wrong, this entire relationship sounds exhausting. Something needs to change, and if you feel you two can't work it out, do yourself a favour and leave."
300,"Can you and your child visit his dad? He might appreciate the visit from your little one. Also, you may regret visiting him before he dies. Maybe your visit will spur your SO to visit his father."
301,"I started saying bad idea when I was first starting to read the suggestion but the person put it very well. This text is a great idea. Try to avoid talking to her in person, it would be hard for you not to have a reaction if she says anything remotely hurtful. Better to deal with it on your own once you read what she responds to the text. 

Even if she does invite you to the wedding, you should definitely write off this ""friendship"" going forward. You have already woken up to thrle telltale signs. People who have no interest in your life, provide no thoughtful feedback about it and always find a way to pivot to their own stuff are very common. And they are always bad news whether they are parents, spouses or friends. Not to say you need to cut such people out of your life but you definitely need to monitor their usage of you."
302,"&gt; He is one of the most logical people I know and I always feel like an asshole for not listening to him when he tells me I'm wrong, but what happened today just feels unnecessarily authoritative on his part?? 

The interesting thing about self acclaimed ""logical"" people is... 

&gt; he went off telling me that it's normal to want to fix someone's hair and that if the roles were reversed, he wouldn't be freaking out like I did. 

They use logic as the reason they are right and you are wrong."
303,"I would be thinking that their inhibitions just left them while they were drunk, and they almost forgot you were there. I’d be thinking about what they had been doing sober, behind my back.

Past actions are a good standard for future events—personally, I’d feel like I could never trust either of them again."
304,I was thinking the exact same thing. He doesn’t give a shit. Thank you I know what I need to do
305,I think you need new friends.
306,Please take all that energy you put into fixing him  &amp; loving to yourself. He might have been codependent &amp; felt the relationship was working for both of you. Sorry you took on all if his emotional baggage to be left in the dust!
307,"To be honest, I wouldn't even do them for her. They're a little too small to charge money that makes it worth the time and effort for you - because while the chore is small, the pain-in-the-ass-ness of dealing with Vevlet is big. 


I'd say something like, ""I don't have time for any extra chores, sorry!"" and just leave it there.


Otherwise I would charge a flat rate per minute; a dollar a minute, maybe?"
308,"That's a good question. A 27 year old dating a 19 year old raises some red flags. Not saying it can't work, but that's a massive gap in maturity and experience."
309,Maybe the wedding is no longer happening or they've had to cut numbers and she feels awkward about telling you.
310,I have left multiple parties on my own for these reasons. You are so in the right. I have friends who were assaulted/raped at parties. I got shit for leaving early and they got shit for not leaving.  I get how your boyfriend feels but he doesn’t have to worry about these things near as much as the average girls does. The constant threat of potential sexual violence (and blame ‘because you were drinking/partying) is something a lot of people don’t fully understand. Good for you.
311,"Alex knows the boundaries of his own relationship. You’ve done the right thing by asking if his girlfriend would be comfortable with this, and he said she is, so it’s probably okay. It might help ease your anxiety if you got to know her? Perhaps having a Skype session with her and him would help ease any potential jealousy from her side. Other than that, I’d say it’s totally fine to go. If he’s lying to you then it’s his fault, not yours."
312,That's a brilliant response that I may in fact use word for word. Reading through yours and other responses here has helped me see sense a bit more and stop any doubts that I was being unfair towards him! Thank you
313,"&gt; I’ve had thoughts of divorce, but to me, I feel like divorce is for things like cheating, abuse, and BIG things

My mum felt the same way, and stayed in a miserable marriage for 30 years. She was 50 before she divorced. Do you really want to spend the next 10 years being just as miserable as you are now? 

&gt; Moving out of our house (Neither one of us would be able to afford it alone), splitting up my family, shuffling kids to different houses, and living single mom life sounds equally miserable

It actually wasn't miserable for us. After the divorce, after we were away from the impact Dad had on us and the household, our days were full of laughter. We felt truly liberated. Our rental house was smaller than the house we left behind, and we didn't have as much furniture, but we were happier than we had been in years. We had belly laughs on a weekly basis, just from relief if nothing else. 

If you stay in this marriage, you'll stay miserable, and you'll have nothing to look forward to except getting older. If you leave, you have a chance to reclaim your life, and to introduce your children to who you are when you are not weighed down with misery."
314,"Sounds like your Dad was worried that he was going to harm himself and in the heat of the moment did what he thought was right. Stop trying to punish him. It isn’t your role to be the parent. 

As unpopular as my opinion may be, just give everyone space to sort themselves out."
315,"There are going to be crappy people our there who try to tear you down, don't date them. You could choose to talk to your bf again and let him know how inappropriate his comments are and that instead of being the type of guy who you can turn to when in trouble he is making himself out to he the type of guy who you have to run from. 

I dated a guy like this. His view was so skewed that I could talk myself blue in the face and he would neither understand nor change his behaviors. He had a lot of good qualities but I had to get rid of him. 

Good luck."
316,"Putting monogamy up for negotiation and saying any relationship with this guy is worth it makes me seriously question your self esteem. This sounds like misplaced desperation given all the context. I’m sorry but it doesn’t seem like you’re as well adjusted emotionally as you think you are; at least with this guy. 

You’d be better off going no contact and finding someone that wants what you want who is your age.  There is a chance he will give you that, but experience tells me that this will most likely end in some degree of heart ache. It’s very likely he takes you up on the non monogamous relationship and you slowly get crushed inside.  There are things that people do to each other in relationships that can change them for the worse for the rest of their lives. Is trying to make this all work REALLY worth, potentially, years of therapy afterward?  Step back and try as best you can to separate yourself from this situation and ask yourself if a friend came to you with what you brought to us, and what advice you would offer her/him with their best interest in mind."
317,"Basically sounds like he is wanting a way out saying that if YOU don’t come back he will deal with it. If this guy truely loved you it would kill to lose you. This isn’t how you deserve to be treated.
Drop him and go enjoy your life show him what he’s missing."
318,"I suggest half-birthday for the reasons you said, but with less “the day my parents had sex” overtone."
319,"* Apologize

* Offer (and then follow through) on being whatever sort of support system she wants (dont presume you know)

* Step back and realize if it was this easy for you to be a jerk for this long with this intimate a relationship and only realize it when you are smacked in the face.... there's a decent chance you are less of a jerk but still a jerk to lots of people around you. 

* Consider therapy to help you rebuild your relationship with your sister and serve as the sounding board / accountability mechanism you may need to do so."
320,"Have you considered the possibility that it's not actually *about* you?

Maybe she has something going on in her mind that she wants to be alone to deal with."
321,This time is different is the mantra of people who always manage to get someone to bail them out.
322,"Also maybe stop sleeping in her dorm that often because all together a 35 minutes commute is not that long and a perfectly reasonable commuting time in the adult world.

I guess the friend is being rude but so is OP, overstating her welcome and sleeping at her friend's place so often for what is really a minor inconvenience. And OP doesn't even clean up after herself using her friends' dorm as her second closet.

Maybe the Friend felt like she was due something from OP which I can't blame her for."
323,"&gt; Remind yourself that her joy doesn't come at a cost to you. That you aren't in any kind of competition with her and if your family is getting bigger it only means more love will be coming into your extended family lives.

This is a really excellent reminder, thank you so much"
324,I know very few nine year olds who would be so blatantly disrespectful and malicious.
325,"I'd say leave him alone , as harsh as it sounds gmt he heartbreak is his personal problem . He hasn't grown either if he's still getting blacked out drunk . 
Also main point is if you contact your ex , you risk stirring drama between the four of you and maybe mutual friends .  Just tel his friends to be there for him , it's fucked up how his friends exposed him anyways (I wouldn't want my friends telling my ex I'm getting blacked out drunk over her at an engagement party....)
DO NOT talk to him . Trust me I been there"
326,"Seriously no more sex and if there are any pregnancy ""scares"" that MAGICALLY HAPPEN, consult a family lawyer.  You can protect your rights as a father without having to return to the abuse."
327,He sounds like a sexual predator. Look up his name on the sex offender registry.
328,"She is 6. She understands you’re a girlfriend. 

And I’m sorry to be blunt but you don’t really get to say that your bf and his child are moving in with you but you won’t be a family unit. It occurs by default. I think you’ve both put the cart in front of the horse here and think that because you control the definitions, it’s all good. 

She’s 6. She understands a lot more than we would think. She lives with dads friend and they share a room. The jig is most likely up. You also are running the risk of her repeating this arrangement to a friend who will scoff “that’s his girlfriend” and now she knows she’s been patronized."
329,"&gt;  I would be causing so much trouble in my family that I doubt any of them would forgive me. 

&amp;#x200B;

OH NO the abusive trash and the people who enabled him for decades might be mad at you for saving someone from his wrath, oh no"
330,"Woah - okay, OP. *I* feel uncomfortable for you, just reading through your post. I think the biggest issue here is that your gf is pretty consistently prioritizing her friendship with Ruby over her relationship with you. You then end up feeling that you're having to ""compete"" with Ruby for your gf's attention, and that sucks. And, it's not going to get better.

Unfortunately, your gf has made it clear where her priorities lie (with Ruby), and their (super inappropriate, imo) friendship has evolved. Whatever is going on between your gf &amp; Ruby is beyond friendship now. There aren't any boundaries, and worse, when you try to draw some, she balks. It feels like YOUR needs are kinda falling by the wayside here, OP.

Is that a theme? In your post, you spend an awful lot of time talking about Emily; her history, her health, her needs, etc. I'm curious, when are your needs prioritized? If you're being regularly back-burnered, maybe it's time to reconsider some things? Regardless of where you decide to go with this, OP, please keep in mind that you're not responsible for anyone's mental health. You're solely responsible for your own happiness. PLEASE make sure you prioritize that, because nobody else will."
331,"Gut feelings shouldn't completely be ignored, but they're also not fully reliable. Sometimes they're our brain subconsciously picking up warning signals, subtle differences in someone's behavior that indicate a problem. Sometimes they're our brain picking up problems that aren't really there. Like, someone may look like someone who caused us past trauma. Usually I'd say pay close attention, but try to examine the feeling and the person. Can you think of anything in particular this guy does that makes you feel this way? Do you have any past trauma or anxieties he could be triggering? Does he remind you of someone?

The Gift of Fear is a good book on how our gut feelings can protect us and pick out creeps."
332,"If you’ve been together for a decade, did you actually get to live put your 20’s and do everything you really want to do? With no inhibitions? That’s a common thing to happen with couples that have been together in this age group. You’ve been together for so long, and not being married and with a family (idk if either of you want that so I’m just throwing things out there) but maybe she’s not happy because she feels like she’s missed out on a big part of her life and being independent while doing it? Just ask her; communicate and comprehend. 

In that case, counseling can come in very handy, or be proactive (based on your relationship) and do kind things like write down 52 ideas and put them in a box. Dedicate an evening to picking an idea out of that box and sticking to it (for example, salsa dancing classes on Groupon for one night or paintballing, brewery hopping, etc). 

Every relationship is different but I agree, with the lack of context, the advice given can be all over the place (like mine, lol)."
333,"There is no future in this relationship.  He believes the word of someone else with no proof and doesn't believe you.  He will always think you are a cheater and will just keep bringing it up.  What if you start working late nights for work?  Probably cheating. What if you get texts from a male coworker?  Probably cheating.

It's not going to get better.  You're only 20, don't waste time on someone that doesn't trust you and believes the worst."
334,"Frankly, if I were in this situation, I would laugh at the very implication that I even MIGHT attend this wedding or have any involvement in my sisters life. She did a fucked up thing, and now she just wants to have her cake and eat it too and act like nothing was wrong. ""If she wanted my support as a sister, she should've acted like a sister"""
335,"Agreed. OP sounds like a person I would like to be friends with. 

OP... I'm sorry your friend wasn't as good of a friend as you thought."
336,"So the first thing to do is to recognise that you aren't responsible for her emotional state. She is an adult. This is how work goes. We can try and try, and fail and fail, and yet, it's still not appropriate to treat colleagues like emotional dumpsters. So as much as she huffs and puffs and cries and whinges, that's not on you and it's not your fault. 

The second thing is, take a step back from helping her wrangle her emotions. Practise saying things like, ""I appreciate it's been difficult for you,"" or, ""It sounds tough."" Nice, inane, bland sayings that don't invite her emotionally dumping on you. If she cries, say things like, ""wow, that's obviously hit you hard. I'll come and speak to you later."" And **walk the fuck away**. Part of her routine is that she comes in and someone else pats on her on the back and mops up her tears and makes her feel better. Don't be that person. Disengage. 

And to be honest, this kind of reaction is probably *why* she isn't getting promoted. If there's any kind of management or control over other people and processes, she needs to show good judgement, self control, and willingness to deal with difficult or stressful conversations. Everything about her reaction to being told no shows *none* of those qualities. 

Management will be looking at how you interact with your peers if you're going for a promotion. They'll be looking at whether you get sucked into her mess or if you rise above it and continue being an exemplary employee. That's what you need to focus on. Not what she's doing or how she's feeling."
337,"There are so many people out there that would love to appreciate your feelings, just remember that. This guy is a grade A ahole and he's only starting to show his true self now. I'd get out before you guys can become even more used to being with each other."
338,I think 6 is old enough to understand. And it’s TOTALLY fine to be dads girlfriend and NOT a stepmom. I’d recommend you check out r/stepparents and search “disengage” for a lot of really helpful info on this.
339,"Unless he can set boundaries with his mom, I would not have kids with this man."
340,Move out.   You’re 21 bro.   Start your life.  Get some roommates.  It’s not impossible.
341,“Dad you realized it’s because she’s never apologized to me first before that she is the way she is now right? You’re not always going to be around to protect her. Her attitude is going to get her no where in life”
342,"Curious as to why you continued trying for a baby when this was all going on? 

I think your marriage is over."
343,DO NOT MOVE OUT!!! She does not get to solely make that decision and like others have said it will severely hurt you when it comes to custody.
344,"Yeah, he let her suffer needlessly. He let her vomit! All just to prove some point that doesn’t even matter. The whole thing makes my heart hurt for OP."
345,"&gt; Why Does He Do That?

Seriously OP this book changed my life and you need to read it. If you google it in quotes one of the first hits that comes up is a free PDF you can read online or download."
346,"Yeah, he’s getting off on upsetting you by forcing you to witness him jerking off."
347,"It’s a power trip.  The only lesson your husband is teaching your daughter is “I have power over you so I can make you do whatever I want.”  It’s bad parenting for several reasons.

First of all, it’s not teaching the kid any moral values whatsoever.  The kid is not learning why it’s rude to do whatever it is that she did.  She’s not learning to not be rude - she’s just learning to not displease her father.  That means that if your father doesn’t find out, she can be as rude as she likes.  Moreover, this will apply to any other life lessons your husband would want to impart - if the only reason to not do “bad” things is because she’ll be punished if Dad finds out, she’ll just lie and do all the bad things anyway. 

Second of all, notice that your daughter submitted to an unreasonable authority figure asking her to do an arbitrary thing for no reason at all.  What do you think she’ll do as an adult when her professor or boss asks her to perform a different arbitrary thing for no reason at all?  Do you actually want to teach her this particular life lesson?"
348,"Is he the same about his birthday whether or not it involves his family? If his family treated him poorly on his birthdays growing up and now every birthday he has a dinner thrown for him, kindly by you, and the people who treated him poorly are there (and he knows/thinks they're only there because they Have to be) maybe that puts a damper on the plans before they even begin? 

It sounds like you put a lot of time and thought into trying to stay positive and make sure he is celebrated. Good luck!"
349,"&gt;  You're as wanted at my concert as much as i was wanted by you after mum died.

Short, sweet, and *to the point.* I like it."
350,"&gt; Let me also say that I have never liked baby showers

So why are you having a baby shower at this point? If they're not for you, cancel everything and move on with your life."
351,"As part of my job, I work with victims of domestic violence. Abusers LOVE to fuck with their partner’s sleep schedule. It’s part of their M.O. a lot of the time. 

I’m not trying to tell you what your situation is, just pointing out he shares that trait with them. It’s not okay for him to do what he’s doing."
352,"It may only be one of those communicating moments when words aren't expressed correctly. Don't over think it.  If he loves you and you love him you are a family. Words can get in the way sometimes. Of course, let him think about this too and maybe bring up the topic at a later time."
353,"Congrats on your job, that's fantastic! 

That said, I'm not sure how to reconcile ""22F"" with ""[your family] won't let me"". You're legally an adult, and are able to go where you choose. Of course, if you live in their house, there are probably rules (no smoking, drugs, orgies, blood sacrifices, etc.) to a point. Maybe you need to move into your own place, or somewhere with a roommate if you can afford it. It seems logical that you need to limit the information you share and set boundaries to move forward. Sure they're your family, they love you with an intense paranoia over the what-ifs, but you're their family too. All you can do is try and convince them to back off a bit."
354,"Good point-she's upset at OP and not sister because the more empathetic, reasonable person in a conflict is always easier to get to bend. As they say, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. In disfunctional families, parents usually ask the good ones to bend over backwards because they know they won't be able to get the difficult person to act better."
355,"Yeah, I was going to say that they managed to make The Osbournes without the participation of one of the family members, so surely they can get by without you."
356,"He doesn't love you, he feels entitled to you. People who love you don't voluntarily cut you out of their life when you've done nothing wrong.

I know it hurts right now, but in a few years you will be glad to be rid of him and his fake friendship."
357,"She has. They say that's rude. 

I find it funny, though, when Joe and Candy just show up at their place with food or show up and take them out, they don't suddenly call us to let us know."
358,It's not your aunt's place to tell your daughter to do a chore - I would be annoyed if I was your daughter too.
359,"I'm confused why, if you see and talk to her every single day, you didn't mention when you never received an invitation?"
360,You have been robbed. Ditch this asshole. Be angry. But leave it behind you as you move forward in your life sans cheating suckers and focus on yourself and how awesome you are.
361,"Op, I would let her read this thread. Honestly I really would. It seems like she needs to realise that whilst yes, you should stand up for your friends at times, you should never let them cross boundaries with your spouse or call them names. Like that's basic relationship 101. She needs to ask herself why she's so desperate to appease friends over you and what sort of person that makes her. Probably a doormat."
362,"OP absolutely did the right thing. 

But the thing about crying and psychology... just, ugh.

My two-year-old will cry, sometimes hysterically, if he doesn’t get something he wants. No way am I indulging every time just to get him to shut up. 

The verbal abuse is definitely wrong, but kids are going to cry. The best way to teach them boundaries is to ignore it so they learn that having a tantrum isn’t a worthwhile manipulation tactic."
363,"Yeah, I would have never made it as long as you have.  The Facebook thing would have been a deal breaker for me.  So if she tells him she wants to give it another try with him it sounds like he's going to tell you that you don't understand about their connection."
364,"I can understand you're hurt, and honestly taking a step back from both friendships isn't a bad idea. However, she sounds like tons of drama..."
365,"wow 25 and unemployed? and a teenage girl is propping him up? LMAO what a loser

366,"This is an unresolved trauma event. Unresolved trauma can effect an individual ongoing, or can come back in many years time and begin to effect an individual. 
Have some therapy sessions to deal with this situation. Although in your mind you’ve resolved it with your husband and forgiven him etc, you haven’t resolved it psychologically. 
Some symptoms of unresolved trauma is 
- anxiety 
-panic attacks 
- shame / feelings of worthlessness 
- sleeping issues
- addiction or issues with eating 
- flashbacks or recurring memories of an event 
- hypervigilance (feeling on guard)"

Is this considered flirting these days? In my book she's really minimizing what she did here. Flirting and dirty talk my ass.

How would she feel if you started sending dick pics and masturbation videos to women? Not good for your marriage. Something's broken with her or your marriage that you two need to fix."
373,"That's what I was thinking too reading it. I just can't think the other woman is that crass to keep blabbing on about wedding stuff if she hadn't invited her, even if she is narcissistic and talks mostly about herself. She might be but it just seems more likely she invited OP and OP didn't receive the invite considering the wedding is big and others from the office are invited and she feels fine continuing to tell OP all about it."
374,"What, your parents aren't footing this bill? At your age that's bizarre. I'd bow out."
375,"I’d tell her to put it on YouTube and build a following. There’s that J J Fish guy who sounds horrible yet makes $$$. If she can put it out there, she can see what it takes."
376,"You need to go right now down to your Title IX (Title 9) office and ask them for their advice on how to proceed.  Seriously, tell your GF you have a stomach bug and go to the Title IX office right now.  This will get your side of the story on paper first, and honestly, when it comes to sexual misconduct accusations, the first person to get to authorities is usually the person who gets believed.

Hell, you might even want to call your University Police right now and ask them for advice."
377,"After I calmed down a little, I called a lawyer friend who referred me to someone who does family law.  We set up a talk for tomorrow."
378,Awesome! As a homeowner from a purely financial perspective of course it makes sense for him. He is paying 100% of all those costs right now anyways so anything you contribute saves him money. Obviously he had other reasons to want to live with you as well.
379,You don’t know C. She is not a friend. C is a work acquaintance. You trusted too quickly. Use a service.
380,My gf has asked me this.. for me the truth is I was assaulted. I passed out at a party and woke up to someone sitting on my face
381,"&gt;He tested you to make sure you were telling the truth.

I don't think he thought she was lying to him, but maybe to herself?  

I have problems with gluten, and I've learned to tell the glint in people's eye when they want to ""test"" if I really am.  Assholes.  But in their own way, they think they are helping because they are imagining this magical moment where I realize I can have their cupcake and live happily ever after.  I don't think it's driven by a belief that I am lying, but rather a belief that they know better than I do.  It's not doubt, but pride."
382,"&gt;He watched you suffer so he could be right.

Just pulling this out so it doesn't get missed. OP, read that sentence a few times."
383,"First, calm down. Get a lawyer, file for a court ordered paternity test. 

Second, and this is pretty important. Babies are literal balls of flesh that haven’t been exposed to the real world yet. They change DRASTICALLY, and can appear extremely different at birth than they will actually look in a few weeks or months, or years. There have been documented cases of this exact scenario, and it turned out the baby was the father’s, just a weird/random draw of genes. So while I know the circumstantial evidence supports your claim, I would advise you to try to take a deep breath and wait for results to confirm. 

I’m curious as to why the hospital staff would pressure you to sign the birth certificate if it’s as “obvious” as you say it is. Like I said, babies change DRASTICALLY. They would know this. Did they perhaps think you are jumping to conclusions?

Just imagine, no matter how little the chances are, if you were wrong. You may well never repair things with your wife and it’d all be for nothing. I don’t think I could forgive my husband for abandoning me and our newborn if he indeed were wrong. 

Look, I know it seems bad. And it might be bad. And if it is, I’m very sorry and that’s an awful thing to go through. But until there’s absolutely no chance... just be 100% sure."
384,If it bothers you then it bothers you. Just tell him that you really find it unappealing. It could have something to do with his upbringing.
385,I’ve had to move around a little and I have found that for some reason it would take me 12 months for a place to feel like home. Hang in there you’re half way there.
386,"**More info for those who want it (sorry if this gets buried!!):**

It's the way he is around girls. He's VERY touchy feely with girls. They're okay with it, though. It's..'just how he is' as they say. In my personal opinion, the reason he gets away with it so much is because he's got an extremely good job that is very looked up to by others, and he's also very wealthy to match that. So naturally, he does get girls coming up to him all the time and he does bring up his job every 3 seconds and everyone is all woo'd by it.

My worry is, not \*every\* girl is like that. Not \*everyone\* is going to like him being touchy feely just because he has a cool, high paying job. But that's just how he acts and so far has gotten away with it. He's very cocky. It worries me because I think, how many girls DON'T approve of the sexual harassment? And kinda just go along with it? They have to exist. His actions must not be okay with just everybody. That doesn't make sense.  I get a rapey vibe, or a, I'm very smart and successful I can do what I want with you vibe.

I just can't help but think the way he treats woman is acceptable. There are girls out there who are going to reject his advances whether it be on dates, or what if they're alone and he just doesn't care? Like, again, I don't know him. It's just the vibe I get  and I can't shake it.

  
I feel as though if I were talking to him, he'd make moves on me and bring up his work, money, etc..and if I rejected him, he may not take it so kindly. That's why my gut just says to not even be near him at all."
387,"Wow. So this poor lil' abused darling gets triggered by your remarks, but the screaming and wrestling sessions behind the wall leave him unaffected?
Ooooohhhkay.
I don't trust his story at all.
And I don't trust any dude who is okay with acts of domestic violence commited by his pal. No decent man is okay with that."
388,You shouldn't have given them a time frame for your safety. What if they have something planned for then? Is there any way you can leave sooner?
389,GET HIM PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL HELP IMMEDIATELY!! These are no signs of an average mentally stable child.  If anything right now would be the time to do something at a young age.
390,"You're right, the reason I'm hesitant to address it directly is that I really don't want to make my work environment really uncomfortable. When she's had issues with people before she's tended to self justify and then cut them off."
391,Thank you.
392,"&gt;he turned up uninvited to my house to ‘make sure I wasn’t doing anything I shouldn’t be’ and to check that I was just at home with my mum like I said.

That is scary af.  

You've had multiple tragedies and drama in two months and he thinks you're fucking another dude."
393,"Controlling people generally aren’t controlling about *everything*. They pick out a few areas to control and flip the fuck out when they feel like they’ve been challenged.

Your boyfriend doesn’t actually think you were doing anything shady. I guarantee. He just doesn’t like to be disobeyed. He feels like you challenged his “authority” by not rushing home to him. And now he’s going to punish you so that next time you’ll think twice about going out at all. 

And that’s a dynamic you should absolutely refuse to entertain in a relationship."
394,"""If you don't want to tell me, that's your business.  However, the idea of going without oral for the rest of my life gives me pause and it's doing a number on my self-esteem.  I think you should know that I am thinking of breaking up over this."""
395,Thank you!! :)
396,"No. 

Tell your roommate that the gf can’t always be there."
397,"&gt; Should I insist she be fired today?

Yes."
398,"Once you give up the leggings, he'll ask you to give up working out next.  ""Who are you trying to look hot for?  Other men?"""
399,Please tell her not to do this. This is how women get kidnapped and trafficked. Beg her not to go. She is in acute danger if she chooses to do this.
400,"Wow, that’s a HORRIBLE thing to do. I’d be scared of someone that tried to control me like that."
401,"Regardless of whether he is cheating or not,
1. He made a promise to you and broke it
2. You have expressed your unhappiness with the situation and he persists. That alone suggests to me he isn't taking your feelings seriously, which is a massive red flag. 

At the end of the day it's your decision whether to put up with this behaviour or not. If he won't change, you'll continue to be unhappy, you'll have to leave the marriage. It's his decision whether to change this behaviour or not. If he chooses not to, meaning he cares more about spending a lot of time with this woman instead of your feelings, then that is his choice."
402,"OP, this is more than a gut feeling. This is a very specific and legitimate concern. I've met a few guys like the guy you're talking about, and actually, I did happen to learn later that one of them raped a friend of mine. I would really trust this instinct and stay away from this guy."
403,They've been together for 10 years and they're 30. Couples therapy isn't the worst suggestion.
404,"It may help you to Google abuse and look at all the hallmarks for more confirmation.  Many people think they have to be hit to be abused, that isn't the case.  Your height and gender won't make you less vulnerable to abuse, I promise.


Please don't be like me. I was told the same thing before I was ready to hear it. I didn't go back to that therapist and wasted years of my life with an abuser, which I deeply regret.

Stay with your therapist and dump your GF for your sake.  She may make it hard and may get nasty and then confuse you by begging you to stay. This would all be a normal part of the process and you have to stay strong to save yourself.

The next time someone says you they will break up with you if you don't bend to their will, break up on the spot."
405,"During the 1.5 years that you were broken up were you not with anyone yourself? No dating or anything?

Honestly, I think the first thing you've got to do is stop yourself every time you decide to start actively thinking about these other people. You're right, this is a 'you' problem and unless you're going to stop making it worse, then you can't expect it to start getting better. With time, assuming you can make yourself stop actively obsessing about these things, it will stop feeling so immediate to you."
406,"I know a couple who was in a similar situation. Except I believe the mom wanted the test done. He wanted a divorce as the baby was black and they were both white.

In the end, it was his. Something like 3 generations back he has a black relative. 

I agree with the others, court mandated paternity test. Maybe also try to talk to her again, raging hormones and what not. Talk to a lawyer first so you’ll know if it is best to let her know what’s coming or if it affects your case."
407,"It does not need to be a confrontation. Next time he texts respond with ""In my view you bear responsibility in X's death, husband shares that view, stop contacting us."" Then block him."
408,"I'd replace ""not comfortable"" with ""not interested"". The first one leaves her room to argue why you shouldn't be uncomfortable, whereas the second leaves her no wriggle room. Although given all the red flags in OP's story, this woman will find wriggle room regardless. OP, you're going to have to be polite yet very firm and the biggest grey rock with this woman."
409,"Definitely do not contact him. Maintain radio silence. I know it can be jarring for someone to move on so quickly, but there's nothing you can do about it except move on and know that you made the right decision to separate because he clearly wasn't right for you. 

Just keep trying to stay busy. Take some time to spoil yourself with something luxurious you'd like to do (like a spa treatement). Spend time with your family and friends.

Lastly, tell your friend you don't want to hear anymore about your ex because it will only upset you and keep you from moving on. It's not your business anymore what he does, and it doesn't matter. He is not part of your life anymore."
410,He's not family. He wouldn't even let her stay after she lost her mother.
411,"First of all, I want to thank you all for being so helpful and constructive— several people have pointed out so far that they must be similar people (this person and my abuser) and I’m recreating my abuse for myself.

This caused me to sit back and think for a bit about the two of them, and what really terrifies me is that other than their latent anger issues (which I wasn’t aware of at the start), they are dead opposite in every single tiny way. In fact, I was attracted to this person because he seemed so completely different from my ex. 

I also waited a year and a half after my abusive relationship to start dating again, so I thought I’d given myself time, and I guess I don’t want to accept that I put myself out there again and did everything right... and still ended up with another abusive person. It’s a difficult thing to contend with, and it really puts me on edge to think that no matter how I approach this, it will continue happening.

I think I’ll just exit the dating scene for a few more years. I was just so excited to finally get back out there after taking so much time to reflect, but clearly it wasn’t enough time at all. 
Thank you for the congratulations on my grad program as well!"
412,"&gt; I don’t want to start over at 26

Would you prefer to do it at 35? 45? 55?

How about if you could go back in time and do it at 18?

Sometimes relationships just don't work out.  That doesn't make them a failure, it just means that they're part of how you grew up and became the person you are now.

Do you want to spend another few years turning yourself into a person you'd hate, turning your life into one you can't live in, just to cling to a fantasy you created? Or would you rather bite the bullet now and just start moving on to a person who won't think, at age 35, ""I should have started over at 26""?

Also, I know it doesn't feel this way, but 26 is not too old to start over.  It is in fact a great time to start over for a multitude of reasons chief amongst them the practical fact that you're old enough and experienced enough to make your way through the world on your own."
413,"I have no idea why you are getting so many sceptical reactions. Honestly, I suspect these are men and they do not realistically understand what we girls have to deal with. I have had a similar issue with my boyfriend plenty of times. For example: dealing with the situation might cause things to escalate or you are not feeling confident enough to do so. Your girl policy is absolutely excellent, stick to it. Your best bet is to thoroughly explain to your boyfriend why the policy is in place, be explicit about things that have happened in the past. If you get through to him he will understand. If he doesn’t, though, I’d consider dumping him. Don’t get into uncomfortable or dangerous situations because your boyfriend throws a tantrum."
414,"Triptans are [insert your favorite deity]'s gift.  I had migraines before triptans were introduced; back then they could only treat the pain.  After the triptans were introduced, I started being able to abort the migraines.

They're no heavier-duty drugs than anything else.   They're specifically targeted at the chemical/neurological process that is migraine.  Your doctor is telling you not to take more than ten a month because if you take too many migraine medications -- of any kind, from Tylenol to triptans to medical marijuana -- your nervous system adapts and you get rebound headaches on days you haven't taken a painkiller.  I've been there.  Sucks.  

Note: If your meds aren't triptans, be sure to ask about triptans at the specialist."
415,"I slept through an alarm for 8 hours once when I was exhausted from overwork. I still wouldn’t say it’s an acceptable excuse for missing an important commitment, however. I set two very loud alarms if I’m napping when especially exhausted now."
416,"There’s nothing wrong with hooking up with good looking men. But it IS shallow. Shallow LITERALLY means seeing something on the surface. All looks are shallow... the way someone looks doesn’t tell you about their values etc. 

You’re equating shallow to be something bad or good, but the meaning is different."
417,"i dont like when people kiss my kids on the lips and i have specifically asked them not to. i also teach my kids that we don't kiss people on the lips so we don't spread germs and always go for the cheek. i'm not a big fan of it either and also, you never know if someone has a cold sore sprouting up or something."
418,"&gt; I'm flattered that he really can't live without me 

Flattered?! That should *terrify* you. You need to set **and enforce** boundaries. You are not his support animal. You're taking on all of **his** anxieties and stresses, which are not your responsibility! And yes of course, you're married, you care, but there's a world of difference between caring and taking on the full brunt of all this shit. What's HE doing about all of this? ""Being on the phone with you 24/7"" isn't a viable answer, by the way. Medication? Therapy? It's his job to find a solution, and you can work with him to support that, but it's not your job to just suck it up forever."
419,I feel sooo bad for that poor baby. Having a family that doesn’t even knowledge him. Wow just awful
420,"You stated she has a long history of not compromising. 

The ultimatum didn't make her unwilling. She is just an unwilling person.

Your wife has previously been in a relationship where she was two-timing her partner(s). She is not a compromising person, and she does not seem like she is a loyal person.

You gave her an utltimatum. She did not abide. If you do not follow through with said ultimatum, she will continue thinking she can do whatever she wants because you will go belly up anyways. 

She is not caring about your feelings. She is not caring about YOU. It is time to take some time away from her. Stay somewhere else. Let her feel it. And while you are letting her feel it you need to consider if this is really the kind of relationship, and the kind of person, that you want to be in for the rest of your life.

If you feel like ""oh but we have a kid,"" let me tell you: growing up with divorced parents is far better than growing up with toxic parents."
421,Also paralegal who started on reception. Yep fire her for sending that email. Immediately.
422,"""I found this evidence that you are a terrible person. I do not want to be in a relationship with this kind of person. I am ending this relationship."""
423,They're old enough to use chairs
424,"Yay for you! I said last time you were amazing!

What's truly sad is this dummy has you right there as a potential awesome friend and is blowing you all off and we are all sitting here wondering how we can find our way to you to become your friend!

Also, I sympathize. I am more like you in the friend department and it sucks to be so aware and nice and giving and most peope do not reciprocate."
425,Your comment was incredibly neutral. Hers was incredibly rude. You didn't do anything wrong. Your boyfriend has some pretty messed up ideas of right and wrong.
426,"* This is a girl he says he will always love because she was his first love
* He lied to me about where he was... he said this was to protect my feelings
* now he has unblocked her off Facebook because he wants to ""see how it goes""

No, I don't think you're overreacting at all. If he'd simply grabbed coffee with his ex because they'd parted ways amicably and maintained a friendship, that'd be one thing. What you describe sounds much more like a guy who isn't over his breakup and would drop you in a heartbeat if he thought he had a shot at getting back with her.

How/why did they break up? If he's so hung up on her I'm guessing she pulled the plug, so you don't necessarily need to worry that he's going to cheat with her because that takes two... but he doesn't to cheat to make it clear he's not valuing you."
427,"&gt;He gets angry with me and says he wants emotional support.

That's because he has no intention of trying to better himself.

He also doesn't want therapy because he doesn't think he has a problem.  The reason that you're the only person left who's willing to listen to him is because everyone else is sick of hearing him complain."
428,"I think you handled this great!! I am similarly conflict avoidant and get very anxious during serious conversations, so I may be biased, but I think that as she's a work colleague your approach was probably better suited to the situation than a direct confrontation. 

That said ugh I'm mad for you! You're handling the situation great and all in all she's just not worth it if that's how she acts, but it's such a let down when someone you consider a friend turns out to be less than. I hope you develop friendships with your other coworkers (if that's what you want) and find people more deserving of your time!"
429,"Do not go to r/legaladvice. I wish people would stop recommending that. Hire yourself a family lawyer who will work for you, study laws relevant to you, and give you guidance for your specific situation. Call a lawyer!"
430,"If you tell them, ""hey, I can't feel comfortable with the rest of you guys if he's around"", I think they'll get the point"
431,"I cried reading this, as right now I’m in almost the exact same position as you were. Except he is the one that wants to break up, and I am holding on with everything I have. Logically I know he isn’t good for me, I know our relationship isn’t working. But it’s been 7 years and I always thought we could be happy and make it work. It’s all I ever wanted. But 7 years and he won’t commit to marriage. He won’t do anything with my family, he constantly lets me down and puts almost everything in his life before me. 

I know I should just end this but I can’t let go. We built a life together and I never want to give it up. I keep thinking of ways to make it work and though I know relationships take hard work and I’m willing to do it, I don’t know if the outcome will make me happy because I’m always just thinking about how to make him happy. 

I’m sorry I’m rambling, I just can’t come to terms with all of this because it happened so suddenly for me. One day I was on family vacation and he missed me so much, and the next he wouldn’t speak to me. 3 days of not speaking and he asked for space to think. So I’ve been at my parents house for the last week stuck in this limbo that I just want out of. I want my life back. I don’t want to start over at 26."
432,This to me says he isn’t actually that understanding of you having a low sex drive. It seems like he’s started to think you guys don’t have much sex because of your “secret sexuality”  or you’re into one of your friends. It sounds like he’s feeling really insecure and maybe you guys should talk it out but I agree that it is his problem he has to fix because you aren’t secretly gay.
433,"Sounds like you might need to take off the kid gloves and press her into explaining why she thinks it would be weird if you met this friend.  That's not you being paranoid, that's you taking an interest in a friend of hers who she is spending a lot of time with and communicating with regularly.  From an outside point of view it looks like she's purposely keeping you two apart for whatever reason.  The fact that she can't explain her reasoning is a little concerning as well because it makes it seem like it's some kind of secret she doesn't want to let you in on."
434,"Just because you can it doesn't make it right. :-)

From reading your original post I get the sense that some boundaries need to be set. And only you can set boundaries for yourself. It'll take some time and effort, and probably feel uncomfortable for awhile, but do it. This isn't just about now, but later in life and for other situations that arise outside of your parents.

You can Google around for ""boundary setting"" and ""discussing boundaries"" and the like and turn up some wonderful resources. Good luck!"
435,"Agree agree agree! Just because she’s family, does *not* give her an automatic “I forgive you”. Blood is not always thicker, or however the saying goes. 

I’m sorry that you were betrayed by your family and that essentially, this guy gets to be included into the fold even though he (and your sister) were wrong in going about it. 

Don’t go to the wedding. You have every right not to."
436,"Yes your roommate screwed up BUT honestly, a landlord should knock/buzz the door before coming in so there would be no surprises.  I hold both of them responsible. This has nothing to do with your childhood trauma


And yes, your reaction is completely normal when seeing a strange man in your apartment.  Don’t let your roommate minimize this."
437,At 26 no matter what shift you work you should be able to set alarms and make it to events you promised to attend. And if he knew he was bad at waking up to alarms he shouldn't have napped. I used to work weird shifts so understand the sympathy but like you have to have some accountability/responsibility.
438,"I don't think it's inappropriate to ask a friend for help entering their career path. People ask me that regularly, and I'm happy to refer or recommend people who'd be a good fit. For the others, you can always be frank - ""Here are the qualifications you'd need in order to be considered"" - or vague - ""I'll let you know if anything opens up that you'd be a good fit for."" 

If people are constantly hounding you for job help after you've already had this exchange once or twice, it's okay to tell them that you'd really like to talk to them about something other than work, then change the subject. If they persist, it's okay to say, ""It's weird that you keep bringing this up after I've asked you to stop."" There's a lot of middle ground between hiring all of your friends and cutting them out of your life!"
439,"Does he in every other way treat you as family? Does he share with you like family, is he there for you like family, does he put you as his emergency contact and come to the hospital with you and everything else you want/expect from him as family? If so, it’s disturbing and I too would be hurt, but I wouldn’t sweat it. 

This sounds more like an issue of semantics, he’s not the first I’ve met - there are people who think you become a ‘real’ family once you have a child, and see the phrase ‘starting a family’ a little too literally - and till then you are a couples or husband and wife. He likely hear people saying ‘this is my family’ to introduce their wife and kids, whereas they’d introduce their wife alone as their wife/by name. Invitarion cards say ‘and family’ to mean and your kids, whereas your spouse will usually either be addressed on the card or be included as a plus one."
440,"Been there, done that. A (now ex) male friend of mine without warning sent me a series of furious texts telling me I was just 'using' him as a friend and I'd better make a decision as to whether I was going to date him or not because he was 'tired of me messing him around.' 

Dude, WTF?

We'd been friends at that point for 5 years (what a coincidence) and all I'd done is treat him like a friend. He clearly thought we were going to date all along and that was his sole intention. Pretty hurtful to realise he was probably only being nice to me to try and get into my pants. 

That was the last contact I had with him - I didn't respond to the texts and I haven't spoken to him since (this happened over 5 years ago). I found out through a mutual friend that he is *still* bitter about it, because he genuinely thought I'd drop to my knees and beg to date him. What a dick. 

In short, ditch him. He's a manipulative twat. Other more genuine friends are available to you."
441,This is also why they're blaming OP. She's the softer target and they're counting on her not standing up for herself like the other girl who started it.
442,"I haven't seen a migraine specialist yet, but I'm on the list. I'll definitely take my husband with me to that appointment when it comes! As for couple's counselling, I'm not sure we're there yet but I'll definitely keep it in mind if we can't figure this out on our own."
443,"sounds like a great time to talk about the other issues you're noticing in your friendship, too. Some people don't agree but I really think you should look at friendships like romantic relationships, in a sense of how you both need to be accountable and keep it mutually beneficial if you want it to continue. 

Just a thought, but it could be that her fiance is jealous of your relationship with her and didn't want you there. She still should have sat down and talked to you about that if it is the case, but it would be less of a blow. Purely speculation though. 

Definitely talk to her and be honest. I hope all goes well!"
444,"I'm probably just going to end up telling them that if he's around, I won't be because if he can't respect me and my boundaries then I won't associate with him."
445,Is it just me wondering what the dudes wife has to be thinking right now too? Is she even aware of what happened OP?
446,Who. The. Fuck. Keeps. $5000 IN CASH IN THEIR ROOM!!!!!
447,Oh yes. Three days is the time to do it. She will only get worse.
448,"I gotta say...you are all being RIDICULOUS. Like, dramatic and flouncy and desperate. 

You talked about one her friends. In front of her. Maybe you were harsh on the friend, but it *sure* doesn't sound like it from this post. Unless you said that Friend is probably a child beater, it was just venting. AND YOU APOLOGIZED. You asked and asked in like four chat scenarios what was wrong, she FINALLY (Dramatica!) deigned to reply to the fricking question, and you apologized. Profusely. You apologized like you guys punched her dog. You APOLOGIZED. 

Should I repeat that for Tanner? 

If I overheard my friends saying something hurtful, I would call them out. For the non-confrontational folks, an appropriate reaction would be to compose yourself, and when able, do the same exact thing...maybe in a text even. 

Instead, this chick left you a cryptic (immature) note (causing you to worry) and flounced, flounced, flounced down the street to *a different hotel*, for f@ck's sake. A different HOTEL. Her reaction to some shit talking and hurt feelings was to move. She could not sleep in the same BUILDING as you two over this. 

I cannot believe you and Tanner have, for two days, cancelled activities on vacation because you hurt your friend's feelings. You apologized. This non-event is over. She accepts your apology and her pants, or she doesn't. It sounded heartfelt. That is all you can do. Stop freaking panicking over when/if/how she will EVER get over your ~~kicking her dog~~ ~~stealing her husband~~ ~~burning her house down~~ being rude about her friend and go enjoy your damn vacation. 

I'm sorry she's sick, but it would have to be like meningitis to explain her...delirium? 

Oh. You've known her a MONTH?? FFS, go sightseeing, kids. This is so beyond not worth it."
449,"You don't think he hacked your accounts, you know. It's obvious he's just never going to admit it.

1. Change all your passwords, including to your email address that would get sent a password change notification.

2. Dump his ass. He's a liar and a spyer, and petty af since he clearly thinks you shouldn't be allowed to talk to any men but him, including famous comedians on Twitter. Dollars to donuts that's why he's done this: because he wants to make sure you're not taking to men. I'd be willing to bet he's been deleting pretty much any message or comment from a man that he's seen before you did. This is just fuuuucked up."
450,"My SO had this happen. He planned a trip, and another guy he had invited, who had originally not wanted to go, decided at the last minute to go AND took over trip planning. He says he deeply regrets not standing up to that guy in the moment and taking back control of *his* trip. Tell your bf that you were planning this trip, that it was supposed for the both of you, and that you are deeply  upset that it's turned into a guy's trip and that he is going along with it. If your bf has any juice, he will not go on this guy's trip and still go on a trip with you."
451,"I like the gentle let down approach. I really hope it doesn’t have to come to me being blunt, but it’s worth a try if nothing else works. Thanks!"
452,"Yeah, this one's no good. Put him back in the ocean and find another."
453,"He's trying ro flirt with you in a creepy ass way. Just let it be known you're not interesred by giving him a crappy response, saying you're not interested, or not replying at all. Leave it at that. He will get the hint"
454,This isn’t a dog problem. This is a boyfriend problem. He is not a good pet owner. This is not going to go well. Good luck.
455,"I'm reading your replies here, and you sound very selfish. When your girlfriend approached you to tell you that she wasn't interested in sex anymore, instead of you asking how you can make it better for her, you started listing off the ways intimacy felt good to YOU. Way to dismiss everything she said because it wasn't what you felt. No wonder she's uncomfortable having sex with you, I can imagine her mid-coitus saying ""ouch, please stop, this hurts,"" and you saying ""no it doesn't, it feels great!"" 

When a person comes to you and says that something doesn't feel good to them, you don't immediately turn it around and say ""So? It feels good to ME. The intimacy, the rising of the emotions, the teasing, everything. I like those things, so I really don't care about what you think.""  You should have asked her more about how she feels. Ask her about a compromise. You don't just immediately force your own feelings down her throat as if she has to deal with them just because you feel that way.


If she won't go to counseling, that's a big problem, it means this is probably unresolvable.

There is no right or wrong here. Sex is a very important part of a healthy relationship for most people. It won't work if a person feels guilted or pressured into it. It won't work if one partner is selfish and bad in bed and the other person gets nothing out of it. Sex may be important to you, but it sounds like you haven't done very much to make it important to her. The fact that you were completely unaware that he wasn't enjoying sex is a huge red flag. How could you not have known? Read a couple of books on sex advice so that you don't make this mistake in your next relationship."
456,"I'm going to chime in to agree that so long as you are dependent on your parents, you shouldn't rock the boat.  The people who are saying they won't disown you, probably aren't getting all the cultural expectations and undertones.  Survival comes before all else.

That said, that doesn't mean that you can't talk with your fiance and explain the situation and work out a timeline.  

Set on a series of goals to be achieved before announcing your engagement.  The most obvious one is to be independent.  Living together for a year is another one.  Some other good goals would be to do per-marital counseling so you can develop some extra tools for communication.  It can be really helpful in problem solving and identifying potential areas where you need to compromise.

I know it's hard.  Their rules are excessive to most.  Just hang in there and don't jeopardize your future.  When you move away, make sure you have all your documentation and precious things.  If they do react in the worst way possible, you'll have what you need."
457,"Dude, that one ""small"" thing is so big that you don't even want to touch him. Why do you want to build a life with someone you don't want to touch? Your boyfriend is gross af. How can you bring him around your family when he doesn't shower? Your friends? Do you think they don't notice?"
458,"Anytime my son has a scratch/bruise/bump, you ask him where he got it, he says a shark bit him."
459,"I was in this exact same situation! We broke up and now I’m dating a new guy but him feeling the desire to have sex with other people is something they isn’t going to go away. I dated my ex for 3 and a 1/2 years and honestly, being in a new relationship has been really good because I realized no matter what I do he will always go “what if”.. not a fun game"
460,"In theory, platonic friends go do activities together and gender's not an issue. That's why it's platonic - it's just friendship. That's also how it is in practice, unless there's something else going on.

&amp;#x200B;

What could the possible exceptions be?

\- If Alex's LDR asked him not to do things like that, or turns out to be weirded out by it. This isn't on you to goaltend, Alex has to handle this stuff himself.

\- If you or Alex have non-platonic intentions.

\- If you or Alex have religious or other additional restrictions on dealing with the opposite sex outside the norm.

&amp;#x200B;

So do you think you or Alex one has non-platonic intentions? Then you should cancel the trip until you've clarified the terms. Otherwise, go for it. It seems like your best chance to go camping any time soon."
461,"Honestly, you didn't really give the ""truth"". You gave him ""your"" truth.  

While I think your parents are going too far with their control over your brother, as a parent myself I'd be annoyed too. It's fine and dandy that you gave him a job which is definitely going to give ""A"" start up in life but to tar all colleges with the same brush because of your experiences may have hindered his own growth. 

Also ,  

&gt; he’ll be miserable so unless he wants to be in a profession that absolutely requires a degree like an engineer, architect, lawyer or a doctor,

This was way too simplistic and you forgot a whole lot of different fields that requires a degree. The sciences for one."
462,My dad used to take me camping. My mom didn't always go. It's fine.
463,"They had a daughter who was a few years older than the kids who were in the show, and she refused to appear in it-- if you watched the show, you might not have even realized they had a third kid."
464,"I think I’m going to move forward with all of this. I’m bummed I didn’t think of the camera earlier. I wish I would’ve done that first and then came forward that the money was missing. Especially since the thief has been taking money little by little. I have a feeling the thief won’t be back now because they’ll probably assume I moved the money/won’t keep money in my room anymore? 

What are your thoughts on me sending a group text saying “if you have the money return it. There will be no questions asked and no hard feelings. You can put it back in my room where you found it”

By this time I’ll have the camera set up and if the thief does return the cash, I’ll have them on camera doing so"
465,"Maybe just be cool and accept that the relationship wasn’t working and that’s fine. 

It’s a small town and you know how gossip travels. Do you really want to run into her 5 years from now and set the community ablaze when you run into her at the church pumpkin patch? 

Consciously uncouple and be done with it."
466,"Generally the *only* reason people want their kids to do well in math is because it could help them make more money later.  Many STEM degrees lead to careers that are in demand, stable and pay well.  Of course not all STEM degrees are created equal. 

OP, you should do something you enjoy for your career, but don't go in without considering the practical side of things.  Keep in mind that the job at the end of your degree may be much different than the classes to get the degree.  I've known people who loved their college classes and hated the job it led to or who struggled everyday in college to get good grades but loved the job their efforts landed them.  Look beyond college to what you will do after.  College only lasts 4 years but a career can last 4 decades.

You should be looking for a career that: 

1) You enjoy doing - it does not have to be your passion, but if you hate it,  you won't do it for long. 

2) Pays enough for you to live the life you want.   There are plenty of people out there who feel stuck because they can't afford the things they want in life - and they may never be able to. 

3) Is a job you can realistically get without excessive competition.  If no one will hire you because the market is so flooded with people who want that job, you won't be able to use your degree. 

4) Is stable.  Having to go out and look for work or self promote constantly is difficult.  If finding the work is more than half the work, it's not a good career field.

Short answer: don't pick a job you know you'll hate, but don't discount things like money and stability either."
467,I feel like I got more heated that he wouldn't acknowledge it was racist than him saying it in the first place
468,Also 9 year olds are normally able to verbalize the difference  between their tummy hurting and being hungry.
469,"He isn’t the problem, you enabling him is the problem.

When you are ready to admit to yourself that he chose you based on your willingness to support him, you will rightly walk away.

You can’t save him.

You can’t hope your way patiently into having a good boyfriend, he either is or isn’t worthy of you.

At 19, you are the perfect age to skip lightly out that door and never look back.

But it’s up to you, to build your best life.

You."
470,"Don't message him. He deleted you, he’s trying to move on and you’re still long distance. It’s not like the relationship-ending-problem was solved, so there’s nothing to be gained by messaging him."
471,"Asking him out isn't a terrible idea.  One way or another you'll have an answer and that will take out the uncertainty.

Just be aware of one thing.  From your post it seems like you've also built up Jake as a paragon of virtue in your mind.  You know him... but not as a partner.  He may be a genuinely good person but that doesn't make him *perfect*.  It may not even make him compatible as a partner.

So, when you ask him out, and if he says yes, take things slow.  There is a lot of intimacy forged from personal strife and personal disclosure.  It may make you feel like accelerating the relationship timeline.  Take your time instead.  Get to know him as a boyfriend and as the person he is, rather than the ideal you created as a comparison for everyone else.

If the instant appeal gets too much, remind yourself he's a person who has flaws.  He won't always know the perfect thing to say, has annoying habits and you may even find there is a deal breaker.  Don't let yourself gush over the man you *want* him to be.  Let him show you.

Good luck, OP."
472,"I really have a gut reaction that he may be having an affair or affairs. It’s common for guys to start putting down their partner when they do this. Running 2 hours late to a family event because he needs to go shopping ?! please. I’d loose my shit on my husband instantly in that situation.

He’s looking for excuses to be away from you and the kids... I think you’re better off moving on just based on how he’s treating you but I’d bet money on an affair being the catalyst for how he treats you. 

Rather than realizing the affair is their problem and their flaw they put the blame on the other person ... my partner is so (fill in the blank here) that’s why I’m incapable of keeping my pants on... it’s sad but I’ve seen it happen so much it’s kind of a classic tell tale sign. 

God I hope I’m wrong though. I was cheated on and I’d wish it on no one!"
473,"She also stole a dress from you OP, ate your food, and took who knows what else. I have a suspicion you'll find more things missing when you pack. She wanted to play things this way, so this is what she deserves."
474,"I'd rather my husband yell at me than give me some passive-aggressive silent treatment bullshit and pretend that isn't anger.


We're human.  Humans get angry.  We especially get angry when our partners are supposed to be responsible for certain things but we end up having to take care of it ourselves.  There's not a thing in the world abnormal about that, but his tactic is to deflect accountability away from himself by instead making it all about you and your ""abusive"" emotions.  Tell him to grow up and take care of his responsibilities and you won't *have* to get angry."
475,“Alterier” is actually spelled “Ulterior”
476,Sounds like he is an asshole who is becoming physically abusive. You deserve more than that.
477,"&gt;My wife would never ever say anything like that to anyone, including Candy. I can't even picture her doing that. She's passive too, and it's entirely out of character for her.

Well it sounds like you guys just signed up for your lives to be ruled by Candy.

Your wife NEEDS to stand her ground, or she is going to lose not only her brother but her parents as well."
478,"You tell him ""This isn't working out. Good luck with everything"" and then you put as much distance between you and him as you can."
479,"I think it would help if you could get some therapy for your daughter. Make sure you check the background and qualifications of the therapist.

I also think that you need to listen to your daughter and let her handle this relationship in the way she sees fit. It might be that she decides to go low contact or stops speaking to her mother all together. You have to support her in her choice. 

Your Ex made her choice to be absent for much of her daughters childhood. Her daughter not liking her is the price she has to pay for that."
480,"As someone with a PhD in developmental psychology please do not worry about letting your child cry. What OP said about attachment is very basic and also just one theory. You should ignore a child when they are distressed, like they fell over, but you certainly should ignore them when they are crying to test the waters, like they want to watch more tv or in your case want to sleep in your bed."
481,Is he really annoyed if my aunt chimed after my dad told me to do something too. This punishment goes way too far. It seems very humiliating once you know why she was rude.
482,"&gt; People keep telling me not to pay her anything, move out, and just be done, but I feel guilty leaving her with the payment of breaking the lease

**She is the one who broke the lease**, when she moved out in the first place.

She agreed to pay the rent on the apartment until August, and signed a document promising that she would.

Just because she irresponsibly planned on part of that payment coming from you (someone explicitly not on the lease), doesn’t make you at all obligated to continue paying.

She also already even broke your “handshake deal”, by moving out early and then expecting you to pay more than the agreed upon amount!

There’s a reason everyone is telling you not to pay anything and move out, and it’s not because we’re all cruel heartless individuals.

*She* tried taking advantage of both you and her landlord, and now it’s backfired on her. It is not on *you* to financially hurt yourself to cover for *her* selfish, shortsighted decisions.

Move out, block her number, move on, and be happy. Stop spending so much time/energy trying to accommodate someone who literally stole from you and tried to take financial advantage of you."
483,"It was wrong of her to continue to wear the clothes, especially your boyfriends jacket after you told her you were uncomfortable. 


But maybe it's just me, but I don't see why this is such a big deal though. Get the clothes back, I doubt she would keep them, otherwise that would be stealing. Wash the clothes, the ramen stain should come out if you hand wash it and don't leave your clothes at her dorm again. Or just don't sleep at her dorm again."
484,OP should consult an attorney about whether or not to make payments.
485,"Why the fuck are you ok with your boyfriend being so close to someone who doesn't respect you and your relationship and supported your boyfriend's cheating? What the fuck dude? You are not being the ""cool girlfriend"" here. You're being a doormat who has no self-respect. At this point, I'd be leaving the relationship if he can't cut this person out of his life."
486,"Just remember it’s her husband that started this drama, not houz"
487,Seems like a small price to pay for taking over her dorm room and leaving your stuff there
488,"OP, what happened wasn't your fault. He just felt you two weren't a good fit for a romantic relationship. That doesn't make you ""deficient"" or anything, just incompatible. You need to move on from this guy and honestly, I'd suggest dating someone closer in age to you. You will probably end up having more in common"
489,"When you were a kid, he was worried you'd ""ruin his marriage"" if he took you in. now that you're becoming successful, suddenly they want the whole family to come to your show... how convenient. people like that are leeches. keep them away from you and your success."
490,"Couples counseling. MIL only gets to stomp because your husband is an ant to her. He's throwing his wife and his child under her bus. Way too keen on keeping mommy happy, how dare you not obey! Your MIL is unreasonable, so i wouldn't be resolving anything and start telling the husband to grow a spine. He's worshipping the wrong vagina and you don't have to accept that. And you have to start standing up for yourself today, because that baby is growing and the older he gets, the more boundaries must be trumped to please granny."
491,"You should recognize this as abusive and manipulative behavior and advise her to break up with him. If he was my friend and I learned that, I would lose so much respect for the person."
492,"Wowwww, and not a single one of them even tried to reach out to you, even after believing that story? Christ, you'd think ppl would be all up on your business after hearing you BURNT A BUILDING DOWN"
493,"It sounds like you're not super familiar with wedding planning, so a couple things that you may not realize:

1. The two months or so leading up to the wedding are typically pretty busy, and

2. Invitations can become a political game having nothing to do with who the couple *actually* wants to invite, and everything to do with ""Our venue has a limit of 150 and mom just had to invite Great Aunt Susan and her sixteen children so now we have to cut all our friends.""

3. Invitations do occasionally get lost in the mail, or people have the wrong address, or whatever. Out of 120 invitations, we had two that bounced back to us as a ""return to sender"" and one that didn't make it at all. If that happened, and she had to re-send, you're still well within the window of when it might be arriving.


I would try reaching out to her one more time and confirming. If it turns out you aren't invited, don't take it as a reflection of your worth, but rather assume that it's just due to family politics. 

Also don't ask people for plus ones, especially if it's a rando and not a serious SO. Your average run of the mill middle class wedding runs $100-$150/guest, so you're literally asking someone who is already paying out the ass to spend $150 on some person they've never met. It's different if it's a SO who has been in your life for a while, but at that point, they will be invited by name because you're a social unit."
494,"A mix of both might help too. If she continues asking about the mental health workshop, that's one you could easily shut down in a kind way. ""I gave it some more thought and I'm not comfortable with attending the workshop."" Don't give her a reason because it will just give her something to argue against or hope that the circumstance will change. Making sure that you don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) is going to be key with her."

Guess what."
496,"Given the power dynamic their relationship started under, their whole thing weirds me out. If Ruby was ever in charge of sensitive material for Emily, this sounds like something that should be professionally problematic. Ruby should be aware that the optics of using a high school to either find pseudo-partners or groom them for this dynamic are pretty terrible."

“Carl if you have me figured out then you’d know by now I’m absolutely not interested in you.”

Make it known in your friend group that he’s overstepping boundaries and you resent he’s not taking no seriously. This is making you uncomfortable."
499,"Now you're becoming more successful ""suddenly he pops up. He probably wants to make everyone believe he's an amazing dad and you got where you are because of him. Fuck that. Tell your dad to fuck off, block and tell the security."

I hadn't consider the rest of what you said and it is very useful. Thank you."
501,"Honestly, there's no way I could ever talk to this guy again. That's not just regular cheating, that's *advanced* cheating. And how could you ever spend time with the two of them behaving as though you support their relationship after all this? I'd just stop reaching out to him and if he reaches out to you, let him know you're disappointed to hear that he was unfaithful to Megan and leave it at that. Or brush him off with being busy if you don't feel like mentioning the drama at all."
502,"Abusive people will unfortunately always be a part of the dating scene, it's up to you to recognize red flags and not proceed further.

A) being upstaged by you
B) having her past life exposed from the time you two were roommates"
505,"There's nothing you can say or do to fix this, other than tell him he's destroying the relationship with his paranoia.  

He is suspicious and accusatory over a nonexistent issue.  He is punishing you for something he believes you did, or will do.  His jealousy is irrational and his response is overblown.

Don't stay in a relationship with someone who doesn't believe you and doesn't trust you.  

If you try to talk to him again, tell him this has zero to do with your sexuality.  The problem here is he is constantly accusing you of lying, sneaking, and thinking about cheating.  If he can't see why he needs to cut it out, he's hopeless."
506,Your family is just telling it like it is.
507,"&gt; It also came out that his mom believes I hate her.

This is pure, 100% weapons grade manipulation on your MIL's part.

If she were *actually* interested in mending the rift, her approach would be ""I handled that badly and caused damage to the relationship with my daughter-in-law. How can I make amends?"" But ""bawwww my DIL haaaates me"" is just victim-playing, trying to frame the problem as being with *your* emotions, and trying to get you and her son to jump to prove her wrong. At absolute best, I predict you will get a ""I'm sorry you may have been offended by events that occurred"" type of fauxpology from her.

And your husband is not the apple of her eye. Or rather, he's only the apple of her eye when he obeys her. She just showed him how fast she'll withhold that ""love of family"" from him, and he fell into line. 

I agree with those who have suggested couples counseling. Having your child end up in the NICU is traumatic. That trauma alone is a relationship stressor, and on top of that, his mom basically kicked you while you were both down. That is a lot to deal with, and it's something you should deal with *now* before the lingering feelings start to really corrode your marriage. If you get a counselor worth their salt, helping your husband unpack the unhealthy parts of the relationship with his mom should be a part of getting past this."
508,"I think culture is a HUGE part of the situation that most commenters are going to miss or dismiss, but imo it’s the driving factor here. 

You are at a crossroads. If you stay with him, you have to accept you’re prioritizing being with the man you love over having the maximum resources to care for your parents. This might mean they have to work longer and push off retirement, or downsize a home. It will mean their old age is, to some degree, less comfortable; they may resent you and your husband for that, and that resentment could be a stress on you and your marriage.  You will also have to witness him in weakness, in pain, and become a caretaker for him decades before you expected to. 

On the other hand, if you leave him, you have to accept you’re choosing to walk away from a future with the man you love, and you’re leaving him at his most vulnerable. You will be giving up the time you do have with him; you will avoid the pain of losing him, but at the cost of forfeiting all the love and joy of your relationship. If the disease progresses slowly, you’ll experience the pain of seeing him living a relatively normal life without you in it; if it progresses quickly, you’ll have the pain of knowing you lost moments you could have shared with him, moments you’ll never have another chance at after he’s gone. 

There’s no path without pain here, and there’s no clear answer.  I don’t think you should tell your parents until you’ve made a decision, and I think you should, as an individual, have a few sessions with a therapist familiar with the cultural obligations at play. There is a lot to unpack, and you need a safe, non-judgmental space to talk it out— and you also need support that isn’t your boyfriend, because he’s got an enormously stressful situation to deal with on top of whatever happens with your relationship. He can’t be your primary support on this, and he might not feel comfortable with you sharing the details with your friends if he’s not ready to make his diagnosis public. Please reach out to a professional to help you work through your feelings so you can make a decision which reflects your core beliefs and values rather than one based on fear or guilt. 

I’m so sorry that you two are in this situation— my heart goes out to your boyfriend, who sounds like a truly wonderful person. I wish you both all the best, whatever that ends up looking like. 💜"
509,"Let me tell you that in my experience, onlookers never care about the original aggressor. Something only becomes a scene when the victim responds, even if it was completely warranted. This is why bullies get away with everything and their targets get punished too."
510,"Thats just a manipulation tactic to get you to stay. And honestly that's how I used to feel. I used to get into these horrible relationships, they would manipulate me and I would feel crazy when I finally snap on them. I thought I was horrible at relationships but in reality I cant put up with being called names, and feeling like my emotions are worthless. My boyfriend and I now have been together for over a year. Never once has he gotten mad at me or even annoyed. He always let's me know how much I mean to him and makes me feel special. I also have depression and bpd and no matter what mood I'm in he Is always there and has brightened my overall life. 
I can tell you that it does get better, you just have to find the right person that you click with, and know their personality before you start to really get serious."
511,"Right.  This is the classic ""I know but I'll pretend I don't know."" He says he wants to show commitment to work on his issues but doesn't ID them.  In my experience when someone can't name the issues it's because they are still at the point of arguing why XYZ isn't an issue."
512,"Yep. I'd favor the dude moving out with little Emily, over OP and him finding a place together! Dude sounds intolerable. Sometimes when living with someone, their true colors appear."
513,If you used a word wrong would you rather know or look like you don’t know what word you’re using?
514,"Sounds like you're just completely incompatible in this area. If physical intimacy is a big deal to you and he's not able to give it, there's not much you can do other than break up."
515,"Thank you. I just knew it had to be some mundane, trivial bullshit that would never get back to your boss in a gajillion years because why the hell would you bother your boss with that nonsense?

517,"Ugh, I have a sister who would take pictures of me at events (like meeting an Instagram famous dog) off my personal Facebook page and would tweet them to celebrities that she regularly tweets at. It annoyed me so much. FWIW, I don't post on Facebook anymore nor talk to that sister anymore (due to other drama), but that shouldn't stop you from posting on Facebook."
518,"&gt;I’m so used to everything moving extremely fast with my previous boyfriends. But all of my first times with them were kinda shit cause I wasn’t wet enough so I’m trying to convince myself that it’s a good thing we didn’t do it today.

Well, yeah.

Having sex you don't enjoy because your partner doesn't care about your comfort or pleasure isn't good. Being able to say you don't want to have sex because you're not comfortable or enjoying it is good.

&gt;Anyway I kept apologising and he kept telling me to stop saying sorry because it’s not something I should apologise for.

Sounds like this guy understands that.

It also sounds like you *are* having sex. You're not having PIV sex yet, but if you're getting naked together and getting each other off, that counts in many people's books. It's not like the two of you have incompatible sex drives or he's feeling starved of touch or intimacy (based on what you've said here). You're just nervous about a specific sex act because you haven't had good experiences with it in the past, and it'll take time for you to relax about it. Reframing it in your mind in this less all-or-nothing way (as opposed to: but we're dating! that means we should be having sex! we're not having sex! I'm failing as a girlfriend!) may help with performance anxiety in the moment and relationship paranoia in general."
519,"You shouldn't down play your achievement. Getting accepted to a grad program is an incredible feat, and you should be proud of yourself. 

I think that, if your body is reacting to his going off at you in those ways you described, then I do think that's a red flag. It also sounds like there may be something else bothering him. 

But, congrats on making it to grad school."
520,Yes it is a huge red flag.
521,"I'm in my early 30s and including me there's 6 bald guys in my friends group, when we stand together we look like a box of eggs.

We are all either married or have long term girlfriends, chicks for the most part don't care and if she does then there's fuck all you can do about it anyway."
522,She'll lose you more business than having a bell at your reception desk ever will.
523,"It’s a tactic you use to shut down narcissistic types of people.  Basically you say as little as possible to them, do not ever engage emotionally, and basically be... dry if that makes sense. Your goal is to give them nothing to work with and basically bore them so that they love on from you."
524,She hand delivered all the work invites so I know it hasn't got lost.
525,"If she is withdrawing from the friendship anyway, what have you got to lose? Might as well give it a try."
526,"I will add, it’s not really fair for you to say “it’s up to you if you want to play games” if it’s really not. If there is a “wrong” answer, tell him. You’ve gotta be honest and straight forward in saying what you want, bc saying it’s up to him kind of implies you will accept whichever, which you clearly won’t."
527,He couldn't stay off of fat fetish websites in front of your mother and nieces.  Is this really something you want to expose your child to?
528,"Thank you so much. That made me tear up. At one point he convinced me that no one would be able to put up with me and my feelings. I genuinely fear not finding someone who will love me that much or was even that much of a fit... but for my own sanity/health, I know I probably should get out now."
529,"If you aren't OK with her flirting with a guy you don't have to be OK with her flirting with a chick. Don't listen to people who sprout the whole 'two chicks, hot' crap as being female doesn't make her any less of a threat. I say this as a married bisexual woman who's husband is OK with the idea of me flirting with a chick but not a guy (but I don't)"
530,"&gt; I tried telling her that if she relaxes it'll be better, but she disagrees.

This is terrible advice on your part.  Telling someone to relax never makes them relax.  Plus you are suggesting you know her body better than she does which is incredibly condescending.

If she likes masturbation there's a very good chance that you are not good at sex and you need to factor that into how you handle this and how you approach her.   Maybe she would be open to letting you help her masturbate?  Maybe the two of you could do sexual things with no attempt to reach climax?"
531,"&gt;.Trying to recoup her hotel costs and rehash the incident on FB is not a healthy use of her time.

I agree completely! Take the high road on this one, cut your friend out, and never look back. Your friend sounds unbelievably cruel, and rehashing things would no doubt play into her taste for drama. I'm so sorry you were targeted in this way."
532,"Just chiming in because I've been there, and I was struggling so hard to be ""fair"" that I was putting every penny I had into bills and he had tons of disposable income left over.
After we talked it out we actually decided it was more fair to try a third option .. besides lump sum or 50/50 split, which  would be a percentage split.

You have to play with the numbers a bit but for a very simple example, 

If you make 1000 per month and he makes 3000 per month, and rent is 1200.. he can pay 30 percent of his income per month, 900. Then you pay 30 percent of yours, 300. It sounds like he is paying alot more but really it's pretty fairly split as you both then have the same percentage for fun money, ect. 

If you eyeball it you might agree to pay 500 per month to his 700 because it SOUNDS more equal, but then you're actually putting 50 percent of your income into housing and he's doing less than 30."
533,"This.  If I knew how important it was for my SO, I'd make a point to be there."
534,Why can’t your wife ask her parents to not invite them?
535,"You can only resolve it if both sides want to resolve it.  If one side counts 'resolved' as only on her terms, it doesn't matter what the other side wants."
536,"WTH is your boss gonna think?!

*""Oh these people? They're my family! You see, I'm not allowed to travel by myself, not even on job related trips! Lol, you should just be glad they don't hang around at the office!""*"
537,"I mean.....listen this is an opinion so take this as a grain of salt but: 

My boyfriend makes it a point not to get into situations that could even give the perception of infidelity. Regardless of friend levels, regardless of convenience for himself, he would never do something that would give the perception that something inappropriate was going on. Why? Because he respects me. He respects the trust I have in him, and he knows how fragile trust can be. Why put your partner through anxiety like that if you don't have to? Intentions aside, motives aside, it's not a living situation a guy should so willingly take up when he's in a relationship. Especially if his girlfriend has reservations. That's not right. It wouldn't be right if she we're trying this with him, and it's not right now. She can be a legit roommate, with her own room, but that's weird to be in the same room. It's just weird and stinks to high heaven."
538,"""Hey, I felt uncomfortable with X thing you said for Y reasons. Can we talk about it? I feel like you want me to become someone I'm not. While I have no issue with smoking weed, I have no plans to become a regular smoker myself."""

541,"First of all, in any management position, you may know things that need to stay secret and/or you aren't the one responsible for delivering that information. So it's a good practice to learn how to keep a lid on it and be discreet and recognize where your own responsibilities are. You aren't responsible to share or deal with this information with her. If she does come to you sad, it won't actually help if you seem to have that info already or offer constructive advice.

&amp;#x200B;

If she does come to you, try to keep it out of work and offline. Her public presence of toxic comments is not helping her, and you don't want to get involved. If you want to be a shoulder to cry on, really just let her be sad, but don't offer advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Try to keep your head down and be professional at work. That's the most important thing. You may have learned a lot of skills from her, but you aren't responsible for her career trajectory or her emotions. You certainly can't do anything to change her, not her drinking or her complaining. So don't engage with it."
542,"&gt;He said if I was so unhappy I should probably just leave and move back (without him)

This is concerning. Is this out of character for him, or does he often go with the ""nuclear option"" when you express any unhappiness?"
543,"He either thinks your a cheating liar or he's gas-lighting you. It doesn't matter which, because you can't build a future on either of those things. 

It sounds like he's playing some weird games, thinking he can get ""the upper hand"" (another insight into his warped view of relationships - that he thinks there should even BE an ""upper hand"" in relationships) by magnanimously forgiving you for something you didn't even do, thus putting you on the defensive, or making you feel like you have to ""earn"" his forgiveness, or prove your loyalty to him, or something. At BEST, it just shows that you two have a broken relationship, because you've been back together for however long, and communication is so busted between you that you didn't even realize until now that he still believes you're a cheating liar."
544,"I like how you put that.. “managed reaction or deliberate reaction”. I totally get that. When I was stuck with my toxic ex and more so when it ended, I’d react the way he wanted me to in order to “satisfy” him, meanwhile I was detaching and moving on. If you cry and beg it’s sick how it pacifies him but it’s like the only way to make him move on. No one I knew could understand it. They all thought I was “too nice” or that I “still cared”, no not at all, I just knew how to counter his manipulation without him figuring it out. Obviously begging him to come back was just going to push him away, so what happens? I get the distance I need. Thank you for the way you put it!"
545,"I’m a 21 year old  and I could think of a million things I would rather do than hang out with a 15 year old kid.

He is really showing signs he cares about you a little *too much* from where I’m standing. Your subconscious as a very powerful tool designed to protect you. 

Fuck is this guy ever creepy though, please never hang out with him again. “I’m not gonna take you in a back alley” if I found out someone had been afraid that I was going to rape them, I would seriously never hang out with them again, that’s so fucking weird.

To me (a non rapist) I would be so offended that they picked up on vibes like that, that I would consider them weirdos and never hang out with them again.

To him, he wants you to put that fear on the back burner and be his friend... i dunno... is he not offended because he *was* being a creep? Yes IMO"

This is also an effective strategy for maintaining personal space on public transport, and getting people to stop telling you to have children."
547,"You don't talk about your brother's past mental state - That makes a world of difference here.

If my kid starts crying uncontrollably and I'm worried about his mental state, a locked interior door isn't going to keep me from making sure he doesn't do something teenage-angst inspired stupid. I don't care how broken up a kid is, they can say something along the lines of ""I need some time alone"". As long as they aren't locking themselves away during an intense emotional battle, I'll give 'em their space - as long as I'm sure they're safe."

Every time a student does this I’m reassured that I’ve done good work at the very least. There is no negative to reaching out if all you want to do is share that this person was important in your growth as a person. 
Do it."
550,"First of: You can drop out.

Yes, you can drop the whole thing.

Sometimes bride and grooms planning their weddings and everything surrounding it forget that the people they invite to be a part of the whole shindig are going to have to spend money to be a part of that celebration.

When you agreed to be a bridesmaid, did you know what you were getting into? That is something that should have been talked over - what sort of travel was needed, what sort of attire was going to be part of the wedding, etc.

If you really feel pressured to stay on as a bridesmaid, time to start looking for cost savings. Could you and some other guests split a room? Could you get a cheaper room down the road? If she's picked out $200 shoes, are there look-a-likes that are acceptable for $40? 

Also, where are the parents in all this? What parent would be OK with one adult child of thiers asking their teenage child to shell out many hundreds of dollars (*months* of income), for their wedding?"

Need lunch? Go make it. I’m not home.

I think setting boundaries will help.

It’ll soon be over."
555,"I see three separate topics of advice here.

**Your relationship**

It's time to accept that your relationship is over. You've had zero physical affection for *nine months*. She's been pushing you away for a long time now. And her recent responses make it clear that a breakup is imminent.

It's for the best. She does not sound like she's in a place to handle a relationship right now. Plus, you two have been together since 16/14yo; you've unsurprisingly grown into two very different people from who you were when you started.

On top of that, you're so dependent on her that you define yourself by this relationship (""I don't know who I am without her and I don't know how to be myself""). That's unhealthy even if you weren't breaking up.

Leave her a message saying that it's best for everyone if you end this. Ask her to move her stuff out while you're away for work, and go no contact for a while.

Then, take some time to figure out who you are outside of her.

**Your dog**

Sorry to be harsh here, but if you travel so much for work that you're gone more often than not, then you are not in a position to own a dog. And split custody with *her dad* seems like a very bad idea; not only does it keep her in your life (which will make it extremely hard to move on), but it's also logistically difficult, and potentially rough on the dog (who has to constantly say goodbye to you for long stretches of time).

Unless your job is going to change in the very near future, it's time to do what's best for yourself and for the dog, and let your GF and her dad take care of it.

**Your future**

You might also consider taking a hard look at your career. You're traveling 17 days out of every month; realistically speaking, you just don't have the capacity for things like a dog or a serious relationship, which require *consistent and frequent* time commitments.

If this is travel volume is temporary, then just keep your head down and focus on getting through. There will be time for relationships and pet ownership once you're done.

On the other hand, if this is just the nature of your career, then it's time to reconsider your own priorities. It will be extremely difficult to ever have a dog or a meaningful relationship if you're gone more often than you're around. Are you okay with that?"
556,"&gt; “she didn’t sleep with your husband did she? No, so don’t tell me to get over it.” 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so sorry for what happened to you. To be able to say something like that to your mom while dealing with so much pain is amazing. That sounds like the perfect, succinct thing to say to make it clear exactly where you stand and why she should back the fuck off."
557,"Why on earth would you do all of his work for him??? Fool you once and all that. Yes, he should have thanked you for your help but this is what happens if you help incompetent or lazy people appear competent. Next time let him survive or fail on his own. If he asks for help, you can say you are busy, or tell him that you don’t appreciate the fact that you did all the work and got none of the credit.

But yes let this be a learning experience for you!"
558,"Oh yeah, it's brought up constantly. But he doesn't care. It's a big'ol joke in the friend group. But those people don't have to live in the house after he leaves."
559,That is so nice. My husband does that kind of stuff. he'll drive me and my friends to our outings and then come get us so we don't have to worry about it. He's the best. He'll text me to tell me he hopes I'm having fun and send me pics of our puppy when I'm out or out of town.
560,"From your description it does sound like there’s a decent amount of emotional abuse, and mom’s BPD is no excuse. 

- she yells at you.  
- she scares you.  
- she insults your size.  
- she’s a racist and will probably make your life hell if she finds out about your black boyfriend.  

That said, the answer is not to move in with a guy you’ve known for only a few months, and if he’s pressuring you to move in, that’s a bit of a red flag."
561,"I don’t think you’re invited, but here is why I think you should send the text...

You don’t want her saying to others in the office that you just didn’t RSVP or didn’t show up. It’s easy to say that the invitation got lost in the mail AFTER the wedding. I know she hand delivered the invitations to colleagues, but if she was sneaky, you should just continue to pretend you don’t know she did that. Put the ball in her court before the wedding, or else she will spin this around like you’re the bad guy. 

If she does end up giving you an invite, she’s doing it out of guilt, or because you’re on the “B Team” list. You don’t need this in your life. When you do pull away, be prepared for her comments and pettiness. She will say things like you’re jealous of her, etc. Rise above and don’t participate. Live an amazing life and shake this friendship off, and use it as a learning experience. It is good to identify the traits of a narcissist. You sound like a very kind and thoughtful person. Don’t change. 💗"
562,"OP, this is who your husband is.

You're never going to get him to rant and rave about a dish with you.

But you could try and find something that you are BOTH passionate about."
563,Wow.  He is the worst.
564,"Filipina here. I have an extended family like this. But since they know how cheap I am, they don't expect much or anything at all. lol.

My advice is to tell him the consequences of what he's doing. That's having little funds when emergency happens and when you start to have kids, where does he think he's going to get that money from? He has a new priority and he has to start focusing his attention to that now.

Another thing I'd tell him is if he want his family to forever ask money from him. He's training his family to be lazy and they're going to be asking for more. I know he might be offended by it but family isn't investments or an ATM."
565,"My guess: It's not about the money. He's just not ready. He talked about the money because he felt like he needed ""logical"" reasons to have this feeling of hesitance. Also, he did directly tell you he's not ready for that step... after you argued against the money reason.

It's not about reasons. It's about his feelings."
566,"Giving you a lot of props for handling it so maturely, and despite being hurt - being respectful of her decision. It sounds like you learned a lot and that will be really valuable in building relationships going forward."
567,"Ok, I'm gonna respond from my own point of view of a 30 yo guy, in the midst of dating. 

This is an awesome life skill ! Like really, it put you miles ahead of most people your age. 

BUT : 

- It's f*cking boring, let's not kid ourselves, I have a friend that is a plumbing nerd, he loves plumbing, he will spend a weekend at yuour place if you give him the opportunity. One thing he has learned it that it is not good date material talk. 

- Depending on how much your live revolves around it some people may be putt off. For example I tend to avoid super thrifty people because I love to enjoy the nice things in life and I want a partner that will be OK with me getting quality products instead of the cheapest ones. 


All in all, if I were you I would probably put it on the backburner or put another hobby in the forefront."
568,"Remember:  *you don't actually owe people a relationship.*

That person at work who wants to be your friend?  Whose desire you do not return?  Well, sad for her but you *don't owe her a friendship because she will be sad and stuff.*

That person you are dating?  *You don't owe them the rest of your life.*  Truly, you don't.  I can PROMISE you that there are no laws forcing you to continue a relationship you do not want anymore.

Don't believe me?  Well then, wait until he hires a Relationship Lawyer and takes you to Relationship Court.  Oh, wait--these are things that don't exist!

Fuck him.  Block him everywhere and when that One Friend (and you have one, even if you don't know it yet), whines about *luuuuurrrrve* and *giving him a second chhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaannnnnnnncccccce?*

Remind her that he's single and looking to mingle!

You are going to feel so free, and sooner than you would expect."
569,"To be blunt, his behavior seems sketchy. I can't fathom why he would be on the verge of crying, and have clammy palms, if he was not involved in the crime.

It's also weird that, instead of trying to brainstorm how to actually *recover* the lost money, he's immediately focused on ""moving forward"" and earning it back from other sources. As if he's trying to draw attention away from the fact that someone just stole *thousands of dollars* from you.

It's impossible for random strangers on the internet to decisively identify the culprit here, but in your shoes, I would at least have a blunt conversation with your BF. Tell him you don't just want to ""move forward"", you want to try and figure out where your *thousands of dollars* went. And you'd like him to support you with that as you take next steps (such as calling the cops, per my other comment)."
570,"Oh, dear, don't be fooled by little old ladies--They are master manipulators and now you're being targeted. Drop her as a ""client"" and just stop taking her calls. Trust me, she'll be looking for another target soon enough."
571,"Exactly. It's a form of emotional abuse. All it's going to do is fuck with you emotionally and mentally, drain your energy, and you're going to have to go out of your way to continuously defend yourself. Relationships require a lot of work. If there is no trust, communication, patience, understanding, or compassion, it'll fail. Better to walk away now rather than 15 years in with a family. He's not the only guy out there. There are so many other men out there that would come to you and have a mature discussion if someone accused you of cheating, or ignore it because they trust you. They wouldn't just jump the gun and leave."
572,"At first I deliberately avoided asking if I'd be invited because when I was getting married people did it to me a lot and I hated it. It's almost like they're demanding to be invited and you feel guilted into it. I didn't want to put that kind of pressure on her, but I did just assume I would be included. Now I feel like addressing it would make things really awkward and just make things worse."
573,"Tell your father IMMEDIATELY.

He needs a therapist (or two, or three!) yesterday!

He is a dangerous little boy who will grow up to hurt humans (not just animals) if his behavior is not curved. He needs psychiatric help!!! 

This is EXTREMELY SERIOUS. You must make sure your father and step mother get him help AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

This is terrifying! This is an EMERGENCY!"
574,"I would add: ""Your jealousy and insecurity has led you to criticize me for mourning a friend being cut down in the prime of his life by an irresponsible asshole. You need to do some self-reflection about what kind of man you want to be, and how to tell when your fears are getting the better of you.""

Frankly for me, if he can't acknowledge how out of whack he was to want you to cry over a break up the same way you cry over *somebody dying*, I don't know that I could continue the relationship. I would have lost so much respect for him, have serious questions about whether his idea of love is actually healthy, and have doubts about his ability to keep perspective."
575,Problem #1 is that your doing the “mean” part of disciplining a kid you met less than 7 months ago. You should not be doing any disciplining at all. I think your girlfriend should handle this alone and you should do nothing more than enforce whatever she lays out.
576,"Aw, please don't believe that you're doomed to end up with the same kind of person again and again. You sound like a wonderful, thoughtful person and I'm sure you'll find a great match.

One thing stood out to me in your original post - you mentioned that some temper issues stood out to you in the beginning. It sounds like your red flag spidey sense went off then, too - but he (temporarily) modified his behaviour to appease you. So to me, that sounds like actually you are very aware of red flags! And maybe you should be listening to that gut feeling even more when dating in future. It's perfectly fine for any temper issue to be a dealbreaker, even the first time it happens."
577,Everyone has expressed their opinions about his lack of respect for boundaries but no one wants to act on it. It’s so incredibly frustrating.
578,"Although herpes can manifest years later, or not at all... an outbreak typically occurs within 10 days or so of contracting the virus while your body tries to fight it. Not to mention it is noy passed via saliva, only skin to skin or mucus membranes. So your theory is not unplausible. His defensiveness is also skeptical."
579,Just block him. On everything. Change your phone number if necessary. You don't have to confront him. He is abusive. It is perfectly fine to ghost an abusive person.
580,"Since I was about 6, if I wanted to do something with a friend my mom would have me plan the get together. She would of course help figure out availability and any special preparations, but I was responsible for calling. It's a nice way for your kid to learn responsibility and you can avoid mom."
581,"Ah. Indeed. Which is how I know I won't be able to ""just sue"" as some people are well intentionedly advising."
582,"OP, please don’t pollute the ocean. Pour him onto your nearest dumpster fire."
583,"Does your bf know this? If he’s annoyed that you wanted to leave a party because an abuser was there, that’s a pretty decent red flag."
584,"THANK YOU.

This is exactly how I've felt. She has been tormenting me by hiding the name for the last month. I've had to see a psychologist and miss class over this. I've been devastated.

I feel like both of them have harassed me. I am still shellshocked that both of them would do this to me. And, by the way, she has made ME feel like that bad person through all this by saying that I lied to her about my past. (It was none of her business!)"
585,"- Stop eating her food. When she cooks for you, tell her “no, thank you” and eat your own thing. 

- Don’t ask her permission for your boyfriend to come over. “Boyfriend is coming over in a few weeks—just wanted to give you a heads up!” If she says she doesn’t want guests, say you’ll stay out of her hair.

- Stop telling her your schedule in advance.

- If she tries to scold you for anything, tell her you don’t appreciate being spoken that way and then leave the room."
586,The ARROGANCE of it all is just astounding. I feel like he has a few character flaws here that OP needs to run away from.
587,"She doesn’t have a rational reason or she wouldn’t have lied to both you and her sister.

Having said that, this story is completely bizarre and I am wondering if you potentially misunderstood some part of it. It is unusual for a liar to just openly confess to having lied multiple times, with no excuse, and then for her sister to just tell you that she lied and why. And at what point did the bride tell you that she didn’t want you there? And she blocked you from all social media and your phone number, while her wedding reception was still in full swing?"
588,"Rapport is pronounced ""ra-poor"" too, if it helps. It's one of many words we stole from the French."
589,"Is this an unusual attitude for him? Is it common for him to be rude to you, to demean you, to start fights?"
590,"She sounds like a very selfish and cruel person.

Thank God you found out and got away before things got more serious or you married her and had more kids.

You did not choose this. She chose this.

&gt;She believes kids should be with their mother and I should be gratefull that she is letting me have them for 1 night like most Dads.

She sounds like a very toxic and negative person. She is ""letting"" you see your kids? Like she could stop you seeing your kids if she wanted? Who the fuck does she think she is?

I can see why she is divorced.

Have a little break and do some ""me time"" stuff, then dust yourself off and see where you want to go next."

593,Snapchat notifies you when someone screenshots your pictures so she definitely got a notification for it unless he used some outside extra app to prevent the notification. Either of those scenarios aren't great.
594,"This should be higher. It sounds like your life revolves around trying to make someone happy who says they aren’t unhappy. Go with that. He says he’s fine? Then you be fine too! Go shopping. Read a book. Cook what you feel like cooking. If he says don’t worry about him, don’t! See what happens."
595,"""Unfortunately we will not be able to attend this year. Maybe once we get back on our feet, we can plan a date to visit.""

Ignore every text/call. This is your answer and they are due no more. While your dad may not be the one doing the yelling, is he even defending you or enabling your mom/bro to yell at you? It's probably best to avoid all of them. 

As a grown adult, having a life and partner of your own, there is a certain level of respect THEY should be giving YOU. I know we are raised to ""respect"" our parents but this crosses so many lines. You're not a child, living with them, or helpless. You're on your own and that is where you should stay. Draw lines, make consequences for crossing them, and stick to your guns. You're never going to get what you want or deserve (a loving, hostile free relationship with mom, dad, and bro) so create for yourself the best you can have.... and that's a relationship on YOUR terms, where you keep your sanity and money. 

No need to feel bad. I know they will play cards at you ""buuuut we RAISED you.....  buuuut we're FAMMMMILY"" ...Don't fall for it. You have a partner who is supportive! Use that! Let them be your leaning tree thru this difficult time of creating these lines. You already had to suffer your family's horror...dont make your partner suffer too. 

You will be much happier once you make those lines and follow them. There are no words that you family is going to say to make any of this better. But there are words to help that your partner will say (and have already said!) ""I love and support you. I will go if you want to go"". Use that support to CREATE the family you want, rather than the ""FaMiLy"" you have. 

Standing up for yourself will prove who is on your side and who is not. If you cut off mom/bro and dad doesnt like not seeing you, HE will MAKE ways to see/talk to you. If hes in with the other 2, then he will let THEM dictate terms to see/talk to you. Then you can confirm if hes enabling or not. There are PLENTY of stories on this sub of children only seeing one parent by sneaking lunches/text. You're not alone! I'm sorry this is happening to you, but you are in a sub of supportive people who understand the heart break of what you feel."
596,Your boyfriend went looking for a fight to pick with you and found it. He needs to do some introspective thinking and figure out why he acted the way he did. Is there some deep rooted insecurity he has about your relationship? I don’t think there’s anything you need to do except be there to listen to him and talk to him once he figures his shit out.

Our babysitter is VERY Christian/religious.  Normally for my husband and I (Aetheist/Buddhist), we can't roll our eyes back enough, but this lady is different.  She says NOTHING about the church unless we ask her (which we sometimes do, but nothing about her practices, more like if she's working on a craft or is doing a play there) and she doesn't try to recruit in the slightest.  She just is a good person.  And our daughter loves her.  We love her too. I'd rather her sit for our daughter than my mother in law!"

And they'll think ""Great, super communicative, very helpful."" They'll just be worried that you wouldn't want them to be in the apartment at ALL. There are reality show stars that never have their parents or siblings in the show. It's not at all a big deal."

604,"I would just be honest with him that you are a bit surprised his girlfriend is okay with it because you know your own views/comfort levels around such things aren't the norm.  So while you know that platonic friendships like yours are possible, not everyone thinks so.  Ask him for reassurance that it's fine, and to elaborate how his girlfriend feels about it so you know you aren't making anyone uncomfortable.  Own up to overthinking it a bit but deciding that it's better to be safe than sorry, because his relationship with his girlfriend sounds lovely and you don't want to feel like you were the catalyst for any issues.

607,"I'm sorry you're being mean-girled by your in-laws! I don't think it's petty for you to want some distance. You have made an effort to be friends with these people, and it isn't working out. 

Your husband isn't very sympathetic because these people have been his family his whole life. You're being thrown into the whole mix ""by choice,"" and you don't have those deep connections. That's okay, you're not doing anything wrong. There's also no reason for you to subject yourself to anxiety and discomfort regularly, just for your husband's sake. So, skip the ladies-only get-togethers, and only go to casual family hang-outs, say, once a month. Don't skip holidays or big events, just stop going every week. Your husband can go without you, and you can stay home and read, or get your nails done, or catch up with friends who are actually kind to you.

If your husband makes a fuss, tell him it's making you absolutely miserable to be around people who don't like you, and you will have a much better time if you don't have to go as often. I really hope he will be understanding about it, but stick to your guns no matter what."

This guy is in a relationship with you and now wants to be wishy washy after cheating on you? Fuck that. Cut him off hard. 

On this being the best relationship *so far*. Relationships get better with each experience. You grow as an individual and a partner. You learn what you like and what is unacceptable. You learn how to communicate. You learn red flags.

612,"Also...has anybody ever told Frank he stinks? He might know and think people should deal with it, but if he lives in a hippie commune and doesn't wash up or wash his clothing, and everyone stinks, he may just not be aware of it. It might be a kind thing to let him know that his hygiene and laundry habits are insufficient to the task of keeping him smelling okay."
613,"This happens *every time*. Also with the guys who pressure their reluctant girlfriends into an open relationship and then discover that their girlfriend is getting laid on the regular and their own fantasy of banging that hot receptionist at work is just a fantasy.

615,"My parents have a similar issue, and have for longer than I have been alive.   Their solution is to have a spare bedroom.   It is not either of their ‘main’ bed, and they both tend to start the night in ‘their’ shared bed.

If dad snores or tosses too much, Mum will slip away to the spare bed.  If he doesn’t, and she can sleep, she stays put.   Similarly, if mum is up too late reading or watching TV, dad might bed down in the spare room.   If either works a night shift/are on call they will often sleep in/return to the spare bed so as not to wake the other.   Basically the idea is just that they have an optional second place if either needs it, but default is still their shared bed.   It has worked really well for them for nearly 40 years.  

Sleep is really important.   It’s important for your health, and the health of your relationship.   Just having a second bed doesn’t mean that every night will be separate - and in fact you might even find yourself tolerating him better if you know you can duck across the hall at any time.   Get the daybed for your study and be happy and rested."
616,"Uh, done. 

What the heck.

How do ""YOU"" not repeat this again?? You are not the problem.

617,"It's not a realistic goal. This isn't like trying to climb a corporate ladder or training for a trade or building up a university degree. Trying to achieve internet fame is like trying to capture lightning in a bottle. 

Sure, it *might* be doable, but this is like trying to make a ""job"" out of playing the lottery, while refusing to work a real job. 

He's delusional, and it sounds like he needs to be kicked to the curb so he can be made to realize how selfish it is to mooch off of others rather than responsibly support himself.

Or does he really think people work normal jobs because we *like* to? Fuck no, I'd *much* rather be able to work on my hobbies full-time and make money off of it. But that *isn't* a realistic goal, so I *do* work.

618,"You will get more relevant help in r/survivinginfidelity.   There are though a couple of concerning things about your post  You are asking the wrong questions.   

&gt;Should I be trying to work with her, when I'm not sure she even wants to stay?

Healing a marriage from infidelity is primarily the responsibility of the cheater and your questions imply that she's actually not taking responsibility for her behavior.  Unless she has explicitly said she wants a reconciliation, you are wasting your time and need to find a lawyer.

You say that you are in marriage counseling but it doesn't sound like you have a specialist in infidelity.  Counseling for infidelity usually combines individual counseling for both spouses with joint counseling about the marriage.  Furthermore, a counselor that starts with the premise that the cheating was caused by the betrayer,in any way, is a counselor to avoid.

Is your wife still involved with boss?  If so, there's no point in counseling; you can not counsel your way out of an active affair and you will get involved in the humiliating ""pick me dance"".   Is she looking for another job?  If not, why not.

&gt;If we do work things out, what future things should I do to make sure our marriage is a safe space? For her and I?

Again, this is on her.  If she isn't intentionally doing everything Linda MacDonald lists is *How to Help Your Spouse Heal From Your Affair"", your counseling isn't going as well as you think.

Also, realize that even with the cheater is 100% committed to reconciliation and healing, it takes a *minimum* 18-24 months for the betrayed spouse to feel safe in the relationship and you will never again trust her completely   That's the cost of infidelity."
619,"this times a thousand. He needs to say something now. I hope he documented that she tried to add him on social media.

I think OP's husband may need to start looking for another job. This lady isn't going to stop.

u/nowtwrongwithchubby I'm so sorry for what you went through. I was bullied in high school severely too, in a bullying campaign led by a psycho girl as well. I totally get what you're going through. PM me if you want to talk."
620,"There might be deeper levels to your girlfriend's insecurity here, but just taking the conversation at face value, your phrasing might have set her off. ""I was horny"" or another 'I statement' might be better than ""Because you didn't want sex"" since then it could sound to her like you're saying ""Well you were my plan A for getting off tonight BUT YOU DIDN'T HELP so this was my plan B."" 

If you got home from a long hard day and she said something like ""I'm going to my friend's house because you don't want to spend time with me"" it could be taken differently than ""My friend invited me over so I'll be back around midnight!""

I think for this situation, just reiterating that you weren't mad at her and that you didn't mean anything by going to have some alone time should be enough. If she has a strong aversion to porn, then there's a larger conversation to be had not immediately following her walking in on you watching it."

I mean we all are going to find attraction in others, voicing it constantly in front of your partner is awful although he might just be a bit daft and didn’t realise how insecure it makes you feel? After all, he chose to be with you, therefore he would find you attractive too! But if you have brought up the fact that you would rather not hear about the other comments and he keeps going then that is solidly being disrespectful."

630,"That’s the thing about racism. When you say someone is racist you imagine a hate filled ignorant loser picking fights with any minority. But racists are regular people. They aren’t the angry evil people everyone thinks.

631,"Are you planning to accept his poor treatment of you for the rest of your life? Do you have any reason to think that he will treat you better in the future? 

Posts like yours (""My partner recently treated me badly in this one recent incident"") almost always lead to the discovery that the partner routinely treats the OP badly and the OP has become accustomed to their partner's contempt and abuse. You don't deserve to be treated like this once, and you definitely don't deserve to be treated like this constantly."

My husband does this all. The. Time. It actually makes me moan and winge about his moaning and wingeing lol. Anything and everything is negative to him. It could be as simple as a restaurant not serving tuna when he was in the mood for tuna. That’s a shame, move on. But to my husband it’ll be 5 minutes of agitated verbal diarrhea. 

For the short term maybe just say something short and blunt like “you complain about everything and it’s kind of annoying. I’m drained by constantly hearing about tiny things that don’t matter. Can you try and see the silver lining sometimes?” He probably isn’t even aware he’s doing it."
635,"So clearly she hadn’t invited you and there’s no missing invite as she hand delivered to other people at work. So at this point I don’t think I’d bother asking. It’s pretty clear that she’s using you as an ear to yack at over lunch but she doesn’t see much actual friendship between the two of you. So if I were you I’d just continue doing the fade.

636,"Your fiancée has spent months planning a party that she's already being judged about and that she will continue being judged about even after the wedding is over.

Clean the damn suit, give her a hug, tell her it's all going to work out okay on the day."
637,"You can absolutely ask him not to attend your show, guilt-free. You have *every* reason to feel the way you feel about him.

The only thing I want to add is, maybe give yourself 1-2 minutes to really think about what it is you want to experience over the next 24 hours (or more specifically, before, during and after this show). It sounds like your dad took a moment where you were truly shining, being recognized for the awesome work you are doing and are about to do, and he pulled you away from it into a shitty place with the comment he made. If telling him not to come to your show could lead to MORE stress and drama for you (rather than less, which is obviously the goal as it relates to this show), consider saying nothing at all to him, letting him come or not come, who frickin' cares, you're not even thinking about the guy or giving him any attention whatsoever. If you have a friend or bandmate who might be good for this kind of assignment, ask them to run interference and help keep your dad away from being able to talk to you after the show. If he's upset or confused at all by not getting the chance to talk to you, well, you can explain why later. The next day. Or some other distant day, and/or any/many days after that... whenever you've had a bit of time to truly think about what YOU want from this relationship with him, if anything. 

OR, if that scenario sounds like more a headache, give him a quick call or send him a very clear text asking him not to come, and then try to detach from the situation there... basically... don't let your dad rob you of any more shining moments this weekend. You don't owe him anything, but he's certainly given you a lot to deal with and has a hell of a lot to make up for now."
638,17-year-olds don't need to hold an adult's hand to cross the road.
639,Thank you. I thought so
640,"So first off, you need to tell your daughter that she should feel absolutely no obligation or guilt from not want to interact with the lady that gave birth to her. That person made the adult choice to not be a parent during the critical stages of your daughter's life. Your ex decided and decided again that her 'wanderlust' was more important. Now that your daughter is older, your ex wants all the benefits that come with having raised a child. It blows my mind that she wants your daughter to recognize her as a mother when she's not even remotely close to what a mother is. And that in itself is an insult to mothers. Either way, let your daughter know oure there for here no matter what. 


Now about you and your ex. You need to take your daughters side, and do not talk bad about your ex unless your daughter comes to you and says ""she said this, true?"" you're allowed to absolutely defend yourself from lies. If it were me, I'd straight up tell the ex that of course daughter doesn't love you. You're a stranger to her. But that's because I'm vindictive. If you want to be polite, I'd suggest just being civil and accepting what your daughter chooses."

That being said, for your specific questions, if she doesn't want to talk about problems that's a generally immature way to handle problems. But you can't force it, so it just get to decide if that's a quality you tolerate or not. If she's dead set on her position then yes, it is a compatibility issue. If you want it to be. If you're willing to compromise on this then it's not. 

Idk what to tell you, a lot of this comes down to what you're willing to tolerate. You're certainly not going to get any clear moral guidelines from Reddit."

I mean I guess it is by definition, the way you describe it, but for me if early on in dating someone said, for instance, “my hobby is having a really great skin care regimen” I’d think “errr wut.” And I like when partners take care of their skin!

Maybe I’m being pedantic, but my advice would be just reveal in bits and pieces that you have your shit together. If it comes up say “oh yeah I’m very rigorous with my budget”, if investments come up say “oh yes I take that very seriously” and go from there. I think unloading it all at once as a “hobby” just comes on a little strong"

He lets you be around his kids often despite you being non-exclusive fun timez hookup palz? You definitely want kids but have no idea if a guy 20 years older than you, who has already raised two children, does?

649,"In most leases, the landlord would have to let every tenant know if they intended to enter, and in many places the law says you have 24 hours notice as well. So yes your roommate should have told you but also you need to get in direct contact with your landlord, first to apologize for scaring him (yes he shouldn't have been in there, but it's good to start fresh with a kind apology), and also to clarify that all communication needs to go to both of you all the time.

In regards to the announcement, I personally feel it’s selfish of your parents to worry more about image that what will make you happy especially as an adult. If a Facebook announcement is enough for them to disown you, I feel like you should really reevaluate how much you want to let their opinions become your choices. I think you should do what makes you happy it’s your life not theirs. Whatever you do I wish you the best of luck and again congratulations on everything!!"
652,"I’m shocked and disgusted. I think setting healthy boundaries and communicating in a relationship is so important, and everyone has different feelings about porn, masturbating, sex, etc. I don’t really think there was anything wrong in how you two worked through your issues with porn. Looks to me like you were pretty open and honest with one another. 

But to masturbate to porn in front of you, more than once, out of *spite* is just... really shocking and messed up. Not to mention that just hours before he was insulting your body type.

I understand porn addiction is so real and causes so many problems for relationships. But he didn’t even feel bad afterward. He said he didn’t care if it hurt you. And he would continue to do it. 

Whether it has to do with porn doesn’t really matter to me, if someone were this blatantly disregarding my feelings, I would leave them."
653,"Ugh yeah maybe it’s because I’m black but the slave tattoo is off-putting and egregious. Her relationship with her dom was consensual and not at all in likeness of slavery. It almost mocks those who have been enslaved and have these horrible markers they wish they could be free of as well. I feel like there could have been a better choice there, but what can you do...?

On another note, her relationship was consensual, and I think communicating your feelings with her and hearing her out would be a good first step. My ex was running around undiagnosed with Bipolar and BPD, and abused and mistreated me throughout our relationship. While my current partner hates that this happened (and my ex tbh), it hasn’t tarnished his view of me. If anything, he has said it encourages him to treat me and others with respect no matter what, as you don’t know their history.

 If you can’t get past it, that’s okay too."

Like I have some real news for him about the average age of the concert attendees at say a Stones concert. 

Or Dolly Parton. I went to a Dolly concert and I think the average age was like . . . At least 55. An entire stadium of retiree baby boomers in pastel polo shirts. And then me and my friends in our late twenties.

656,"I think there’s something more going on with them. I would literally die for my best friend, who’s been my bff for 15 years, but I honestly can’t imagine talking to her like that. ‘Baby I need you’??? That’s a gf text. Straddling, holding hands, cuddling. It all seems too much and I have to wonder if maybe ruby is even taking advantage of your gf if they met while Emily was in a compromised emotional state. 

There’s no good answer but you have to be aware of what you’re comfortable with and stick to that."

To be blunt:  you guys were *children* when you first got together.  To me this sounds like she's just not happy with her life.  There is a chance she's abusing substances to escape the life she has.

661,"&gt; I have had some personal health issues that lead me to believe that I may have trouble conceiving.

So have you ever actually talked to your gyno about that and gotten a check up? This would be the first thing I'd do. Being overly anxious never helps.

&gt; I know that women have babies in their 30s all the time without an issue, but I've always wanted to have kids before then. 

So do you really want kids before 30 or are you just worried that you'll have issues when turning 30? Might be time to get a check-up and really think about what you want."
662,"If OP hasn't, I would strongly suggest using these exact words with her boyfriend. This is not a guy hitting on her at a bar, this is a superior sexually harassing her in her workplace. If he can't understand the difference between those two things (not that jealousy would be a good look in the former case either), then I would question not only his ability to be supportive, but his ability to think critically on a basic level."
663,"Hey you guys just keep the communication going. That’s the most important factor and the foundation to long standing lifetime relationship.

My boyfriend and I have the same situation. I make significantly less, and recently my contract with a company is up and transitioning into a different t industry. That being said I handle the “domestic management” e.g laundry, dishes, ect. He handles “financial management” we check in with each other and ask what we can do or what goal we can set to help the other that week.  

My check in consists  of us reviewing our finances and savings goals, and keeping our groceries in our budget, what ever we have left over in surplus goes into a fancy vacation fund.  When I am pulling in money most of it goes to a savings account. I recommend putting a portion into amex saving account. The interest is amazing. Also we use YNAB. 

I ask him to do dishes a few times that week, or sit with me to fold laundry. If I cook he cleans the kitchen, if he cooks I clean the kitchen. It’s fun to do chores together and help each other. I never thought laundry would be fun but after a busy week sitting there and just talking can be really romantic.

There will be times in your relationship where one is contributing in any area more than the other and times where you’ll need to lean in for support. You got this.

I’m excited for you two. Sending you virtual high five. 


Be well 🍀"
664,"She's the one who decided she's in love with you, exactly as expressive as you are. It's not your job to worry that she's wrong about what she wants. 

But even if you were right, and she wants an expressive guy... is opening up for a relationship with this person  you're so fond of really that daunting?"
665,"It's because his mom did an awesome job raising OP. But you are right, he should tell him to fuck off and notify security."
666,"&gt;I told him to have a nice life

Good.   I hope you also have a nice life."
667,"If this has only been an issue for the past few weeks...I gotta assume it has to do with the stress of the wedding. 

My best friend’s wedding went beautifully. Everyone had a great time, everything that was supposed to be delivered was delivered, everyone was on time, really just a smooth day. And she *still* had a meltdown after it was all over, because it was just...a *lot*. She couldn’t stop fretting about what everyone else thought, if anyone was unhappy, if anything had gone wrong and she hadn’t known about it, etc. And she is not a person inclined towards meltdowns. Weddings are pressure-cookers and there’s a reason that lots of people decide to forego them. They’re *stressful*. 

If this is abnormal behavior for your fiancée, do your best to be patient and keep her grounded. Make time for the two of you to relax with each other. Make time that distracts you both from the wedding and lets you focus on something else for a while. Make sure some of that time is built in to the actual wedding day. Even 20 minutes of quiet time between the ceremony and the reception could make a big difference in everyone’s mood. This shit is tough and I’m unsurprised that she’s fragile right now. Remind her that you’re on her team and that you’re here to help."
668,"Honestly,just tell her. My OH is the same age as you and has the same issue. 

Bald can be hot. I actually think he looks amazing bald (though he disagrees and has spend thousands on treatments, transplants etc). In the beginning he hid his hair loss with topical concealer and whatnot too.

It is not a big issue (at least not to me). The fact is that you hair is a small part of you. It doesn't make you who you are. 

Your hair will not be the reason she is with you. Tell her."
669,"So why aren't you holding him to the promise he made? ""Hey, you said things would be different after we married and they aren't. Why aren't you keeping your promise you made to me?""

The bottom line is that I think you two need couples counseling at this point for the marriage to survive. I would not have children with this man if you guys can't get on the same page when it comes to his parents and finances."
670,"Yeah... I tried to use the solution route.  He gets angry with me and says he wants emotional support. 

Trying to convince him to go to therapy is another thing altogether because it’s “so inconvenient” “troublesome” “i don’t want to waste my weekend” 

I’m so drained!!!"
671,"Agree, but I would take a little of the focus about how shitty he's being, and shift it into how his behaviors make you feel and what the solutions are. i.e., instead of ""you don't even thank me and you're grumpy and mean and just ruining everybody's time, I'm not even gonna bother if you keep being so shitty about this"" which will feed into his victim complex/view as just another way that everyone is shitting on him at his birthday, I would say ""it feels like a slap in the face when I am putting forth a ton of effort to make this good for you every year, and every year all you can say is how awful it is. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough, and like I shouldn't even bother because you're telling me I'm failing, over and over. I need you to decide if this year, you want to just avoid your birthday because you genuinely can't enjoy it, or if you want me to put the effort in. If you want me to plan something nice, I need you to promise me you're not going to shit all over it. If you can't do that, then we need to agree that we're just going to skip it this year."" 

The problem isn't that he hates his birthday. Lots of people hate their birthdays. If he wanted to feel like shit and sulk in a depression hole on his birthday, that's his right. Lots of people would rather go home, do something distracting alone and go to bed early so that it'll be over as soon as possible. But to insist that you do effort, and then implicitly tell you the entire time that you did a shitty job, that it's not good enough and your efforts are pointless year after year... he's being actively shitty to you, and it being his birthday is NO excuse for that type of behavior. He needs to decide if hurting you is"
672,I have to return some video tapes.
673,Maybe you can ask her sister?
674,"Your family is crazy. This is going to make it close impossible for you to form healthy relationships. No one wants to date someone that brings family along on dates. A job might fire you for your family making it difficult for you to do your job. 


Move out as soon as possible. And no, you don't need their permission."
675,"Your dad is treating you poorly because he’s on meth. I’ve tried it myself and it turned me into a monster. The issue here is that you have no control over your dads life. Even if you confront him, that doesn’t mean he’s ever going to stop. He very well might kick you out. The best thing for you to do is find a way to support yourself quickly before everything goes to shit. You are an adult now and you need to be responsible for yourself because your parents clearly aren’t willing to do it for you."
676,"Your husband has no reason to be livid. LIVID, JFC! And he is 100% wrong when he says that other wives don’t do such things. I am 49 and I STILL go hang out with my BFF for overnighters. Hell I’ve even spent a week away on vacation (in my 20’s)! And guess what, nothing untoward happened! FFS if your marriage is strong, then there is nothing to worry about. If your marriage ISN’T strong, there STILL doesn’t have to be anything to worry about! I’ve been married 31 years and still going strong. My husband encourages me to go out and have fun with my friends. He wants me to get that fun energy from my friends, whatever it is. Bar hopping, concerts, drag shows, theater, ballet. All the things. I come home re-energized and happy and I bring that positive energy home to him. Which makes our life together better. And I do the exact same for him.

OP, I am SUPER worried about you. You are isolated from your family and friends. That is not good. Do you have access to your bank account, or does he take care of all of the fiscal responsibilities? His anger (livid, gah!) at such a small thing is super concerning as well.  There are so many things in your message that I’m worried about. :( 

You absolutely should stand up for yourself and NOT let this go any further. I think this will only escalate.  If you do end up going, and he throws a tantrum and throws you out, then you dodged a GIGANTIC bullet. Please, please, please know that. He is exhibiting really, really concerning behavior."
677,No you need to tell her. Her behavior is unacceptable and if you can’t tell her someone should. You people are adults and thus need to act like it and adults tell other adults why they can’t come to events. The only way people change is by being told about the things the do that is offensive to the group. Be honest and even tempered when talking to her. In fact I would take her out to coffee.
678,"All good questions. (She answers below that she lives with her parents, so they can't spend the month at parents' house.)

I have another one: 

&gt;and his best friend is supposed to take that room even though she probably won’t be able to afford it.

Soooo, what's the plan, Phil? She lives in room with BF for a month and then moves into spare room...only to not pay rent?"
679,"Yeah,,, fuck that. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, you know....you, uh, shouldn't wear those khakis, you look like a white piece of shit racist who makes racist comments and then, uh, doesn't want to own up to it"" lol"
680,You're effectively teaching your kids that this is what a relationship is supposed to be like.
681,"100% 

OP, go to counseling and find your “normal”. I am also a survivor of an abusive marriage and I HAD to do this in order to develop healthy relationships."
682,"&gt;My \[28F\] boyfriend \[9M\] woke me up by pouring water onto my face. He then walked out. Am I overreacting here?

This is a very problematic post title."
683,"File the restraining order. Do not wait. Get it done, that way if the situation escalates you don't have to start at square one. 
I know you want to appear kind and generous in the situation, but he's starting to show up to and from her way to work? Heck no. He's showing escalating stalker tendencies, and I would not feel completely safe with her being alone until he's taken care of. He's already trying to get her family involved, and he's pathologically lying. Please bring the law in on this immediately."
684,"All of these are major red flags and honestly, I don't think the person you're with is capable of having a healthy relationship. All of what you've written are signs that he is not at a point in life where he can handle being in a healthy adult relationship. Dating is a series of auditions to find out if the person you're with is someone you can build a life with and IMO this guy has failed his auditions. Red flags are red flags for a reason and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring them."
685,"&gt;And if the worst comes to pass and I need another job,

You need another job as soon as possible. If Paul is so influential in your company, you also need to start thinking about how influential he is in the wider field and how/if you can counter that. 

Also, you might think about whether you need this boyfriend too."
686,"I’m a lawyer. Please talk to an employment lawyer in your jurisdiction. Most offer free, confidential phone conversations to assess your case and give you an idea of what the process looks like going forward and how to document any adverse treatment at your job (or other relevant events). Before going to HR, the EEOC, or your state’s equal employment agency, talking to a lawyer will help you know what to expect. Please don’t worry about paying attorney fees, and don’t make any assumptions about the immigration issues. I am not telling you to “just sue.” I’m telling you that you shouldn’t assume legal options are not a viable pathway so early on, and by assuming so, shoot yourself in the door regarding things like documentation and knowing your rights and options. It’s overwhelming, I know, but talking to a lawyer does not commit you to anything, even to working with that particular lawyer. 

None of this is legal advice, obviously, just practical advice. 

I’m sorry about your unreasonably jealous boyfriend. He’s taking out his insecurities on you, and that’s not a kind or loving thing to do, regardless of whether he says he loves you. Love isn’t just a feeling, it’s a set of actions based in respect."
687,"As a Criminology grad student, I can tell you that harming animals in childhood is one of the major predictors of later violent behaviour. You need to tell your parents NOW and stress how serious this is. He NEEDS intensive therapy."
688,"Yep. Same here, my baby sister has legally been an adult for some years now, but I moved out of my parents house to go to travelling and eventually to college when she was 9. She's still a little girl in my head and it takes a lot of effort sometimes to take her for an adult. She has a job. She's way more responsibke than I am or will ever be. But I still call her by the name she used to call herself when she couldn't pronounce her own name yet. Once a baby sister, always a baby sister."
689,Dude you shouldn’t be dating someone who you feel this way about. And it sounds like you’re totally justified but still.
690,"I agree, because I  have to work with her and see her every day, a frosty and awkward atmosphere between us would really suck. I'm sure we will settle into a new normal of just acquaintances."
691,"I think that everyone shares culpability here.  You didn't like the college life at your institution.  Instead of advising your brother to consider the different lifestyles of different institutions -- smaller school, big city vs. small town, you painted all colleges with the same broad brush.

Your parents are right to be upset.  Encourage him to enroll in some local community college courses and do more research on finding a college that will be a better fit for him than you had.

Your"
692,He doesn't really sound like a bf. Sounds like some guy she knows.
693,You need to get into therapy first and only make any big life decisions with the help of a therapist that you trust.
694,I just found out. I’m ending it as we speak.
695,Or maybe she should have left him the second the douche bag had the audacity to complain that she wasn't serving him. What kind of piece of shit would expect that from someone?
696,"So blocking doorways is often how physical abuse starts, then they move up and it gets worse.

Basically when they block a door the woman is likely to try to leave the room, squeeze past him, push him (gently) to get by, or in your case close the door. Once the woman makes any sort of light physical contact they use that as justification to strike back. Sort of a you hit me first mentality. They *always* hurt the victim back more that whatever happened to them. Then they blame the victim for the abuse for “starting it” or touching him first.

If he hasn’t started already I bet you he will blame you for getting hit with the door."
697,"The only boundary we've created thus far is simply not interacting with Joe and Candy at all. My wife is fine if that stays that way forever, but her mother wants it resolved, and I'd actually prefer Candy's behavior to improve but I don't think it will."
698,I mean yeah he sounds racist and his family sounds ignorant tbh.
699,"OP, I'm an attorney and a lot of this is state specific. Dont take legal advice from redditors. Dont even go to r/legaladvice. Get your own attorney TODAY."
700,"&gt; typically am the one who does the ""mean"" stuff like making him clean up his mess and what not

 Saved the big one for the end huh? This is the main problem. You should not be doing any disciplining, hell, you shouldn't be doing any PARENTING after 7 months together. That's insane. At this point in your relationship, your girlfriend should be only very gradually introducing you to the kid.

 I suggest you talk to your girlfriend about you slowing this down and taking a much more hands off approach with the kid. There's still time to form a good relationship, but you're going in the wrong direction."
701,This 100%. So many people instead of admitting they were wrong need to find someone to blame. She chose you. You're what's called a scapegoat.
702,"What else should the sister have done? The sister only discovered what was happening on the day of the wedding, so it's not like she could've helped OP ahead of time. She tried to help OP settle in so OP wasn't embarrassed, then went to find out what was happening on behalf of OP. Upon discovering the truth the sister told OP, and let OP go quietly (which is what OP wanted) rather than embarrassing OP by making a scene. I can't think of anything more the sister could've done to help OP. Did you expect the sister to ruin the wedding or something in revenge? Remember the sister has just found out about this, so it's reasonable for her to want to get more information and hear the bride's side of things before just going off on the bride. For all we know once the sister had more information she may have scolded her sister (the bride) for her behaviour."
703,"Thanks for that.
The following was eye-opening.

""In order to overcome this type of abuse, it’s important to start recognizing the signs and eventually learn to trust yourself again. According to author and psychoanalyst Robin Stern, Ph.D., the signs of being a victim of gaslighting include:

You constantly second-guess yourself.
You ask yourself, “Am I too sensitive?” multiple times a day.
You often feel confused and even crazy.
You’re always apologizing to your partner.
You can’t understand why, with so many apparently good things in your life, you aren’t happier.
You frequently make excuses for your partner’s behavior to friends and family.
You find yourself withholding information from friends and family so you don’t have to explain or make excuses.
You know something is terribly wrong, but you can never quite express what it is, even to yourself.
You start lying to avoid the put downs and reality twists.
You have trouble making simple decisions.
You have the sense that you used to be a very different person – more confident, more fun-loving, more relaxed.
You feel hopeless and joyless.
You feel as though you can’t do anything right.
You wonder if you are a “good enough” partner.""

All of those things apply to me. :/"
704,"It can be hard to reply perfectly in the moment!


I think you should sit him down and say something like, ""I was so stunned by what you said about our trip that I just said 'okay' without thinking. But I want to see if we are both seeing this the same way. The way I see this, you just uninvited me from a trip I planned with my boyfriend and replaced me with your friends. How do you see this?""


That gives him room to both consider your perspective, and to explain his own."
705,"You've done enough. Your MIL wants things to be all fine, but they never will, because there is no reasoning with Candy. 

Something else: in their attempt to keep the peace your in laws seem to be more and more favoring Candy. The only thing to do to prevent that is to keep being vocal about it. Basically, rock the boat yourself as well. Otherwise Candy *will* keep getting more and more attention, simply because she is the one demanding it the loudest, and your inlaws want to keep her quiet."
706,"My sister went behind my back with my live-in boyfriend of 3 years. I found out when they announced they were getting married (I was still with him). It was the most hurtful, humiliating thing they could have done. On top of that, my (narcissist) mother supported them completely, and helped plan the wedding. She forced me to go, and it ended up being me alone on one side of the room, and all these people that my sister and I had gone to school with on the other side, laughing at me.  I was so so devastated. I cut contact with my sister for 15 years, during which time my ex cheated on her and dropped her (shocker), and then died shortly after. I recently reconnected with my sister, but things will never be the same- she has not once said she was sorry.  If I were you I would just go no contact with those people, and don't let them back in unless they approach you will sincere regret and apologies."
707,"So your SIL is a mess and your BIL might be in an abusive relationship. Isolating a SO from their family is a classic abuser tactic, so you guys not being able to spend time with him alone is a huge red flag. Combine that with your BIL's vulnerability after his divorce and it seems like he might be in more trouble than you guys seem to think. I realize that this isn't really what you were asking about, but please make sure your BIL knows you guys have his back if/when he wants to get out from under Cindy's thumb."
708,How on earth does picking up corn teach her to be more respectful?
709,I reread my post and trust me. I’m embarrassed that I even wrote this this.
710,Thanks. You think a drunken kiss is an unforgivable mistake? I am so torn. Thanks for your words
711,"As an expressive woman married to an unexpressive man... 

I like it this way. I draw him out, and he keeps me grounded. As long as he's honest, we're okay. He'll let me talk myself out without getting caught up in all the WORDS and FEELINGS and CAN YOU BELIEVEs and EMOTIONAL OVERLOAD - like the more expressive guys I know inevitably do. 

There has to be a good foundation of commonality - which you clearly have, because you guys are each other's main person - but there's a reason for the 'opposites attract' phrase. :) Don't overthink it. Tell her what you've told us."
712,"Thanks for that, you put what I was thinking into words really well."
713,I would be out. That is insanely controlling and deeply limiting.
714,"Stop worrying about being nice. This guy is a creepy fucking stalker, and this is **not a safe situation for you**. You need to find out what you can do or who you can report to to get this guy away from you, and then you need to completely cut off contact. I'll add that you need to have safety plans in place, and other people looking out for you, and if you see or hear from him one more time after cutting off contact, you need to contact the police and begin seeking a restraining order. These situations turn violent on a regular basis, so please be careful, take this seriously, and seek help."
715,"It's very simple. Candy in no way gets to tell your wife that she can't see her own parents. If she isn't okay with that, she can fuck off and stay away. 

Stop giving in to her, because that's the imitr way she'll stop steamrolling you and your wife. As for Joe, well, he's on his own because he's obviously too scared to stand up for himself."
716,The younger sister of my highschool best friend recently reached out to me...worked out for her.
717,"Your Dad’s behaviour here is so weird to me- it’s like Mean Girls levels of involvement in a drama that doesn’t concern him, and I think he’s actually making it worse. 

Tell him to stop being an intermediary, you and your sister will sort it out if and when you want to. 

I would look into narcissism if I were you, there’s something not right here. 

Look after yourself, trust yourself, believe your version of reality."
718,"I’m a lesbian and I have a straight best friend that we hold hands and cuddle. I’ve asked her to stay at my place and sleep in my bed when I’ve been upset before. We’ve also drunkenly made out. I fully recognize that’s not normal. She does, too. We’ve done a check in or two where we both are very clear on our boundaries. She is one of the most important people in my life.

I’m seeing a girl I like A LOT right now and when I told her about me and my friend she got visibly uncomfortable. I very much got the vibe she wanted that level of emotional/physical intimacy with me. So, I’ve made more of a point to go to her, not immediately my best friend for those things. And to tone it down with my friend, who completely understands and loves the girl I’m seeing because she’s healthy and makes me happy.

That’s how this situation should work. Also, as a WLW, I’m side eyeing this whole thing. Someone is in love with someone - money is on Ruby. A frank conversation about boundaries and how this makes you insecure, but also about how supportive you are? You sound super reasonable. If you get rejected in that talk, I feel like it will tell you a lot."
719,Your comment makes a lot of sense. It's hard not to resent Rachel due to everything she put me through. I don't want to be this petty person and will need to keep her out of my head.
720,"You've in no way broke his trust, its your finance""s brother who's done that, you have to tell your finance if this keeps up because he deserves to know what his brother has been doing behind his back. You're right it may not go well however its not right that his own brother is doing that behind his back especially when you've told him multiple times its not okay."
721,"Yuck. I have no idea if he cheated or not, but I would feel a little bit uncomfortable if my bf was masturbating to a picture of a colleague. I'm ok with porn, and I certainly can't tell anyone what to fantasize about, but I don't think I'd be down with him having pics or video of people we knew in his spank bank."
722,"It's on you to set and maintain some professional boundaries here. Treat it as a business transaction and stop worrying about being nice, because she is the one overstepping. Stop doing small chores for her, or ask her to pay the extra upfront. Do you keep your other customers in the loop about your schedule? If not, then stop doing it for her too. If you can't walk the dog and she wants you to, just say you're not available, no explanation needed. If she's really really counting on you to walk the dog on a certain day, then just tell her to check in with you at least x amount of time beforehand.

If she goes all

&gt; ""I give you such regular business you shouldn't be taking on other dogs right now.""

Just go with a ""Thanks for your concern but my business is doing just fine""."
723,"&gt; but that they won't turn on Carl because he's ""different"" when I'm not around. 

OH HOW REASSURING. 

Your friends have a funny notion of “having your back” if it means “do absolutely nothing and keep hanging out with Carl.” I hope they all cringe looking back on this decision in a few years."
724,"OP has been abused and helicoptered for so long, she doesn't even realize how not normal this is."
725,"Of course he’s terrified of it, it will require that he change his behavior, and why would he want that? 

You’re indulging what is, genuinely, an astronomically insane expectation of another human being, and his requiring that you abandon every need or desire of your own to function as his emotional landfill. You are not helping him, despite what you may think. Quite the opposite. He’s a thirty two year old man for dogs sake, not a helpless sickly infant—if you want this to stop, then make it stop."
726,"The fact that she went over your head with a client's family only 3 days in should be cause to immediately terminate. She clearly doesn't have respect for the way her job works, and ""she didn't tell me"" is one of the most unprofessional excuses she could have used."
727,"What I am hearing is that he wants to fuck other people and doesn't want to feel bad about it. So he's being ""honest"". It's almost like he is saying ""you either let me fuck other women or break up with me so it's not my fault. It is heartbreaking to think about but I wouldn't be surprised if he has backups lined up already."
728,Just pointing out that I don't think we should make any assumptions like that. OP seems very genuine but we only know one side of the story and jealousy isn't always the cause.
729,"My thought exactly. Her husband probably mentioned in passing he thought you were a hottie, or something similar. She got Bride-zilla Syndrome and hated you out of no where."
730,"As a frequent camper, this doesn't seem that weird to me.  I mean don't share a tent or anything, but beyond that it's no different from hanging out in someone's hard for an evening."
731,"My husband does this when we're at home, or at his parents' home, and there's a sauce on the food that is just too delicious.   He knows it makes me twitch, I know that my WASP sensibilities of *what if someone sees* are a bit unreasonable when it's just us.  The compromise is that he'll just step into the kitchen and clean his plate his way, whole I'll take a bit of bread and clean my plate my way.

We make a bit of a joke of it -- ""Avert your eyes, dear!"" -- but he's never had a problem with making a small adjustment to make me comfortable, just like I made a small adjustment of not pushing to outright banning the habit.  It's also something he'd never do in public, or at friends, it just seems to be a bit of familial oddness.

And, in the interests of full disclosure, we had a maple sugar pie last week that sent *me* into the kitchen to get every last drop."
732,"This is the problem with people who don't ""believe"" in medicine--they'd rather see you suffer than admit that they've been wrong about the whole concept of medical treatment their whole lives. Now you know what you can expect with literally any medical problem you'll ever have--he won't care, he'll accuse you of faking, he'll roll his eyes at you, and he will actively sabotage your health by trying to talk you out of taking your prescribed medications. As someone with chronic illness, I see these as deal breaking behaviors. I don't think he's fixable, because this is about his fundamental belief system and a deep lack of empathy. Just my opinion. Like do you want to be dying of cancer one day and he's over there telling you that you just aren't *thinking positively* enough?"
733,"That's what r/legaladvice would tell him, lol."
734,"I am planning an offsite meeting for work and one of my coworkers is taking her 2 daughters out of school and bringing them with her husband because she hates to travel alone. My boss and I were having a side conversation around it and it's just such a pain. We only have to travel for work as a team once per year and we seem cold when we say her husband and kids can't come to the larger group dinner. 

It's such a waste of time and money to me."
735, Just want you to know he made the strapless dress comments to hurt you and he escalated the fight when you didn't take the bait. He is trying to get you to leave him.

And in terms of you and your husband.... have you considered couple's therapy? Especially the fact that your husband is set on having a bio kid due to being adopted.... what if it doesn't work out? Better to work on this now."
737,"Incredible update.  One caution though. I am not sure it would be a good idea to revisit the issue if she brings it up. Short of a full on apology beforehand, i am not sure sharing your feelings with her will be beneficial. 

Goos luck on your journey to be more of whatever you want to be."
738,"Your post and all your replies shows that you know what he's doing is effed up. 

You need to put your foot down on this matter. You either prepare yourself for a future of disrespect and your feelings being disregarded or leaving him."
739,“Does anyone here have any objection to this marriage ?”&lt;———— your time to shine
740,"It’s totally up to you man. If you don’t want him there, don’t have him there. And don’t feel bad about it either. If it helps, I’d do the same if I was in your position. I hope the show goes well though, no matter what you decide to do. I bet your mom would be proud of you"
741,Did you speak with his wife? What was her reaction?
742,"Doesn't matter. Make an anonymous call to police, let it be on record. When someone shows up on the hospital, they will have that at least."
743,This! The only time I’ve EVER been wrong when I thought someone was cheating he never pushed it back on me. He never called me names. he set out to show me I had nothing to worry about and he proved me wrong and didn’t fault me for worrying.
744,Yes she was
745,What does an open door *mean?* It sounds like you mean either one of you could end it at any time but that's...all relationships. It isn't something special and specific to yours and so doesn't in any way exclude cheating.
746,"Wow that is harsh... firstly she cannot legally kick you out of the house. If the lease is in her name you are sub-letting and by law she must give you notice (usually 30 days) to vacate.   
With regards to the car, it is legally hers if in her name and was gifted... However whether it paid for in cash or through finance makes a big difference.  

If it was financed I would stop all payments immediately and notify your bank of the situation and ask for some advice. A financed car is not technically yours to ""gift"" - it remains property of the bank until it has been completely paid for. So you could argue that it is an incomplete ""gift"" as you didn't have full legal ownership of the car to gift it and she would have to either give it back to you (presuming the transaction is in your name) or take over the payments."
747,"I think you're taking this reach out a little too personally. 

You admit yourself that you didn't make any attempts to keep your relationship going, so it's not really fair of you to be butthurt because they didn't either. 

They probably reached out to you because y'all used to be friends and they still think of you fondly.  

Besides, I find it very hard to believe that they're asking you to actually plan their entire vacation. Just be kind and give them a couple of recommendations. 

Sure, you could completely ignore them, but would that actually make you feel any better?"
748,"&gt;but I feel like I can't get through to him, and to respect me when I ask  for him to not do a certain thing whether it's not touching my hair or  **not doing a certain thing during sex**.

This statement took this conversation to a whole different level. WTF. You need to leave."
749,have you asked her? An invitation could have gotten lost in the mail.
750,"u/ladygrey90 i am really worried about you after you read the comments to your post. So i wanted to take the time to say PLS PAY ATTENTION TO THIS COMMENT. Especially:

&gt;i think any normal person in your situation would have expected an invite

I agree with this 110%. I for real do NOT know what the ppl below this are on about that you are being passive aggressive and dbt/cbt therapy ASAP. They are acting like you are just some person she chats to act work and somehow completely ignoring the following:

1. Yall grew up together

2. She cried to you DAILY when her breakup(?) happened.

3. And this one really grinds my gears SHE IS A THIRTY YEAR OLD WOMAN who was tactless enough to share EVERY SINGLE GODDAMN detail of her wedding planning to someone she wasnt even planning to invite! Like how fucking self-centered do you have to be to do that??? Which leads me to:

4. Her reaction when you brought up wedding invites. She KNEW she fucked up and it was written all over her face, you said yourself that you saw it. WHY this didnt occur to her before idk, i dont understand ppl who are that obliviously self-centered and ive given up trying to.

With all that being said therapy is def something i wpuld recommend for everyone. Its helped me immensely. Best of luck sweetheart 💜"
751,"Holy shit, most spot on description of myself I’ve ever seen"
752,You should probably move out of your shark-infested house.
753,"

Cold sores don’t have to be visible to be present, diseases are easily spread through saliva, and “culture” doesn’t mean you have to accept something that makes you uncomfortable.  

It’s absolutely fine to quietly ask them not to kiss your baby on the lips.  You can say it’s a health issue that you’ve discussed with your pediatrician or not give a reason at all.   You don’t have to justify the request.  

But I would advise that you do so quietly, and away from other relatives, before they greet the baby.  This will prevent others from trying to step in and force the subject and may help save them a little embarrassment.   

“Grandma, I have  a small favor to ask of you and Grandpa. Would you both mind not kissing Baby on the lips? I realize that she’s adorable and it’s hard to resist but we’d really appreciate your support on this.  We’re trying to set an example so that everyone else doesn’t start kissing her on the lips too and your help &amp; example would make all the difference”"
754,Seriously. OP sounds like such a lovely person.
755,"I see your point but it wouldn't make sense for this situation....like she isn't depriving herself of anything. Either way,  people need to stop thinking they know more about someone's else's body or doctors!"
756,"It gets me. I've gone without any sleep, prioritizing whatever plans he and I have made together, just because I found that more important and knew I'd sleep in if it weren't the case."
757,"Yes you are being abused.

Stop taking her shit.  Stop letting her control you.  Go see your family more.  Go see your friends.  

Do whatever the heck you want with your time, and if she has a complaint she can leave (or if you live at her place, you leave).  Offer to end the relationship if she has complaints.

And in 3 weeks, move out and block her on everything.  Have your parents call the police if she harasses them at their place.

Be aware that she can escalate to violence, and something like a knife or gun can be deadly regardless of the physical strength of the  wielder.  Be aware that she can also escalate to lying, to the police, about you abusing her."
758,"She knows. Everyone knows. You’re bald. And that’s fine. 

I wish men would understand that the only thing that is embarrassing about being bald is when men try and pretend they aren’t bald. Crop it close or go full cueball. Just don’t try and fake a full head of hair."
