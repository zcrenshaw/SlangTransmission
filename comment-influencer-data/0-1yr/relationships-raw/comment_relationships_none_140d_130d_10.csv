0,He needs to go lay in kids bed with him. He can be the one that is uncomfortable not his wife who is pregnant with his two children.
1,"&gt;He made one last comment like ""it's not my fault your girl doesn't know how to talk.""

Wow. Dude, huge props to you for kicking him out. 

You were even nice enough to do it on his street so he could still get home safely. Getting in trouble is his own fault, he was being a total shithead and you are a great boyfriend."
2,"Instead of seeing the vacation as a gift from you, he sees it as that money belonging to him, which in my opinion, is wrong of him. 

You didn't offer him the option to go on vacation or pay is loan (it's not your job to pay them anyway), you offered him to go on vacation because you would like to spend time with him... 

Basically what you're doing is for yourself first, he just gets to enjoy the ride, not tell you what to do...

He's wrong for thinking this money belongs to him unless you're not mentioning a previous agreements between the two of you..."
3,"There is no logic. She is abusive, i know this is hard to hear but you need to leave. A partner should not ask you to give up your work, your friends, and everything you enjoy so they can be happy. I am sorry you are in this situation."
4,have you asked your son if they're dating?   have you made sure he's informed about safe sex protocols?
5,"Oh, honey, no. Throw the whole man out."
6,"Your dad has utterly failed you.

I would tell him so, and that would be the last time we spoke.

You need to move out and focus on building a life separate from them. They are weak, toxic, evil people."
7,"Either ignore her when she does it, or ask her, ""Why are you talking weird like that?"" 

The shock of being questioned will at least make her think twice about how she talks to you."
8,"Once upon a time when I was a little sister that suddenly had new much older brothers (our families blended and moved in together), there were a few things that really helped me warm up to them. 

1) One of my new brothers privately told me that he was really excited to be part of my family and for me to be part of his. I had been worried about him not liking me because his parents did and had some confusing fears about being replaced. It helped to know that he didn’t see me as competition, but as a teammate. 

2) It’s great that you’re making an effort to do things with your parents around because she’s getting more comfortable with them. I’d suggest also purposefully spending time alone with her. Find something for just y’all to share. For me, my brothers and I would watch Dragon Ball Z together and act out the fights. Maybe for y’all, check out the new She-Ra. It deals a lot with choosing who gets to count as your family and it’s 100% geared towards kids. 

3) get creative together. Make up stories together, play pretend. Some kids like to imagine a world where you are already close, like best friends or dogs together. It lets them explore the idea of friendship/siblingship while keeping a bit of a safe distance. 

I really hope this works out for you. You sound like you’re going to be a great big brother."
9,"Your problem isn't your MIL or SIL, it's your partner.  You need to sit him down and have this out with him.  He then needs to handle his family."
10,"I would tell him over text, something along the lines of:

""I had a really nice time the other night. I'll be honest, I didn't realize that you were interested in me like that, so it sort of took me by surprise, but I'd love to go on that date with you! There's something i want to tell you first, though. I'm not sure if you realized this, but I am a trans woman. I understand this might be a surprise for you and you might have some questions about it, so feel free to ask me anything.""

Something like that. Good luck, OP! I don't think it's naive to hope he'll still want to date you, that's kind of what dating is all about--showing other people who you are and hoping they're into it. But I DO think you should tell him over text for your own physical safety, and because I think it might be less awkward for you both."
11,"You need to have an honest conversation with him with the child out of the room about this.  Totally unacceptable.

Stick up for yourself."
12,"If you're in the same friend group, make sure those friends hear about it from you before they hear some watered-down nice version from them. He dumped you and immediately started seeing (or had been seeing while you were still together) one of your closest friends. Don't let them go to your friend group saying some shit about how you're ignoring them and pushing them away before those friends find out who betrayed who in the first place."
13,"I'm so sorry you're having to go through this OP and I hope your situation gets better soon.

&gt;stepmom has ruined my family and I don't think it is fixable.

I'd reframe this as your dad ruined your family because he is a weak, weak man who is attracted to abusive women. He wouldn't protect you from your bio-mom and won't protect you from step-mom. He doesn't deserve you."
14,"Wanting to avoid unnecessary drama (even if you aren't the one being unnecessary) isn't childish, it's just reasonable. But you also can't really avoid it.

""Oh, we can skip shopping, I found a really amazing deal on a dress so you don't have to worry about it! What do you think about chinese for dinner?"" Repeat ad nauseum. Redirect immediately. Mention that you would feel guilty if your mom put herself out just for a dress, and then ask if she heard about that new netflix show. When she presses, and she will press, brush her off. ""Mom, I already told you I got the dress taken care of, so you really don't have to stress about it. I've been meaning to ask, what's your book club up to?""

Honestly I don't think this is a situation you can ""win"", just one you can manage. She's a narcissist, there's no outmaneuvering that, so if you're committed to her being involved your best bet is to just be cheerful teflon and act like she's being silly when she tries to pitch a fit about it. She's going to act like you're being unreasonable or mean to her either way, you can't stop that, but you can keep from giving her the attention and drama she's looking for."
15,"This is what my dad did. I wanted to go camping at 16 in a group of friends - boys and girls. I wasn’t dating anyone. Dad whipped out a box of condoms and had a hugely frank birds and bees discussion. When my friends came to pick me up he had the same talk with them and gave them condoms too. I’ve never been so embarrassed. I also never got pregnant until I was 39, so his talk worked wonders!"
16,"About 15 years ago, a friend of mine got laid off at 53 years old. Gov't paid for him to go back to school, then he started looking for a job. Never found one. Ended up having to take early retirement.

Age discrimination is real, and there's not much you can do about it. All I can suggest is to just be there for him as best you can. Take him to movies or something and get him out of the house."
17,You are dating a child who wants a mommy to take care of him and throws a tantrum when you ask him to lift a finger.... this isn’t going to change any time soon
18,"Best thing to do is to have the talk. Make sure he understands the dangers of teenage pregnancy and whatever you do do not suffocate him. Encourage him. Talk to your wife and advocate for her to follow similar advice. If you cut him off completely from her he's going to become upset and likely have emotional issues (especially considering how well he took the move). Also understand that your wife is stressed because of the move, environment change, and the fact she's seeing your son grow. Reassure everything is okay and remind her not to be too constricting. Let your son figure things out on his own, just make sure he's aware of what could happen (especially with unprotected sex) and be encouraging"
19,"&gt;I feel like I'm losing the person I married and they've been replaced with someone that I wouldn't have wanted to date if I were single.

My dude, this is exactly what has happened. It's wonderful that you're supporting your spouse. You've clearly educated yourself on  But you are a straight man. And you married a woman, not a masculine nonbinary/trans person. You have lost your wife, the person you married, and you are perfectly within your rights to grieve her loss.

You are also - and I may be crucified for saying this - not in the wrong for not being sexually attracted to your spouse now that they are no longer presenting as female. You are not wrong for leaving the relationship, if that is what you ultimately choose to do. The person you are married to now is a person you did not choose to marry, and a person you are not attracted to.

That's okay, and unfortunately par for the course in many relationships when one partner changes so drastically. It's nobody's fault - your partner is a new person now, and there is nothing wrong with them, but that new person is just not compatible with your orientation."
20,Your friends are jealous. Enjoy your relationship.
21,"What the fuck. 

&gt; One of her brothers apparently didn't lock the door when he left in the morning. My husband went in, then into her bedroom where she was sleeping and sat on her bed.

So exactly how many times has your husband tested that door, waiting for the day it would be left unlocked? This is 100 percent predatory behavior. 

I'd tell her to call the police while I started calling around for divorce lawyers."
22,"You said you would leave.

Leave and go from there. There is a world of difference between leaving temporarily, like a separation, and leaving for good.

He needs to understand that you mean your ultimatum, so you need to leave."
23,"&gt;I guess I could give him the talk. I just know he won't like it.

Tough shit, Joey! Not everything in life is pleasant, and indeed many necessary things are not.

Have the talk. Look at it this way, if you are wrong about him not dating this girl and he does knock her up because he didn't have access to birth control or information about safe sex, then your wife's worst fears will be confirmed and you'll never hear the end of it."
24,"Your needs trumps the kid's wants. 

You *need* bedrest. Bill *wants* to sleep in the big-person bed, but really, he just wants comfort from his dad. That can happen in Bill's bed or the couch.

You, and the two little people growing inside you, currently deserve to have your needs recognised far more than Bill's wants."
25,Sometimes people are mad and it's not because we did anything wrong. Give her time to let it blow over.
26,So big family friend that's like a sister to him but he's never mentioned to you before? You've been together for 3 years and this super close friend has never been mentioned? Typically all inclusive resorts require 2 people to a room- are they sharing a room? It sounds like he was seeing her while you two split and hasn't really stopped.. You have every right to be upset. The birthday thing not so much. It may have been the only time.. but honestly it sounds like a romantic get away... I can't imagine they're not sharing a room and a bed.
27,"Also

&gt; I feel like this event led to the breakdown of everything. She started to have no trust in anything I did, constantly going through my phone, and she would constantly lock her phone, or lock herself in the bathroom talking to someone on the phone.

MASSIVE red flag - this is textbook ""I'm cheating on you and am reflecting that back on you because I assume that if I'm cheating, you must be too""

That isn't necessarily the case, but it's very common, particularly when it's a change of behaviour and the two changes (hiding their own behaviour, investigating yours) happen at around the same time."
28,"Use that money for him how? What are his plans, is he starting a business? I’m confused does he also want you to skip the vacation? I could understand him saying “hey I’m not employed and I’m really struggling I don’t think I could take a vacation right now and I might still need your help so I would hate for you spend money on a vacation for me, why don’t you go enjoy yourself and I’ll be here when you get back” but if he doesn’t even want you to go that’s a bit much."
29,"Yes, you're being disinherited (not disowned), but it feels like you are being disowned.  


He (or his new wife) is saying that they will not treat you the same as your brother and stepsister.  And reasons don't matter. 


While love doesn't equal money, it's more about the intention. He's not helping your brother pay off college debt.  He's helping your brother who's already in a financially better situation than you.  It's not about the wife's grandkid; it's about your relationship with your dad.  And I'm really curious (and worried) why he would allow his wife to make such an announcement, which indirectly means that she views you, your GF, and your GF's kids differently than the others.  AND was he a coward to tell you? 


I think you need to take a step back from him and the new wife, and talk through your feelings with a therapist - just for a session or two. 


After you calm down, I would suggest you ask your father a few questions:

- Is this what he plans?  Why did his wife, not him, make the announcement?  You plan to marry your GF and adopt her kids; will they be included in his will, like his wife's grandkid?  You love these kids and want to ensure they are treated fairly like the other grandkids.


The last question is the important one.  If it's all about the grandkids, then there's no issue.  BUT I suspect there will be issues.  And that's why I want you to have a therapist on hand - to discuss next steps. 


Sending you lots of hugs OP.  Hang in there."
30,"Well, he's definitely over reacting. Even if you DID spend all that money on a designer bag- it's your money! If I was at the get together, I would be so excited for you and asking you all about it. I am all about the deals! 

Just out of curiosity- are these bags ACTUALLY trying to pretend to be MK or Gucci or what ever (and even the seller says they're real), or are they just inspired to look like that? Since you said they're super good quality- I'm wondering if it's more of the inspiration and therefore you wouldn't even have to call them ""fakes."""
31,"I work in the medical field and am bound by HIPAA. I always tell people they can say they saw me but I can't say I saw them.  You are 100% in the right, I'm sorry your friend is so upset.  I think you may be right about her feelings being displaced"
32,I’d renew your plan to move out. Tell them you appreciate them letting you live under their roof rent free but that it’s not worth the trade off of their controlling behavior towards you. You worked hard to buy the PC you wanted and you should be able to enjoy it.
33,"Soooo true. The socially acceptable response to “I love your dress!” is “thank you so much! I found it underneath a dumpster, a mouse was living in the right sleeve so I gave him a piece of Wisconsin cheddar in exchange! And it has pockets!!!”"
34,"You should remedy this mistake by losing the whole girlfriend. You're 19. No offense, but most normal 26 year olds think of people your age as children and would never date them. Now you know why your girlfriend is with you....because 26 year old guys don't put up with her tantrums and bullshit. They know most adults don't act like that, so they dump her and move on. She can't find someone her age to date, so she started looking at much younger, inexperienced guys who haven't figured out what they want yet.

Don't buy her a diamond, that will just ensure she'll throw a fit every time she wants something in future. She'll know all she has to do is be mean and cry, and you'll give her anything she asks for. 

You making a ring was a very thoughtful gift, and she doesn't deserve it"
35,"Yeah, my wife is pregnant. I would have slept with the kids."
36,"This is absolutely divorce time, this would have been change all the locks and pack his shit time."
37,"&gt;or had been seeing while you were still together

This.. sudden breakup after things were going well.. he was already seeing her, I guarantee it."
38,"She likes chocolate ... awesome. 

Find her a chocolate based activity you can do together. 

7 year olds in general prefer to be doing things with people, than talking to them. 


Try making chocolate eggs, decorating cookies. 

Make sure one of your parents is around, as being adopted at that age means she will have abandonment issues, so she will be much more relaxed around people she knows. 

Thank you for allowing her to go at her pace."
39,Yeah. Usually I would be against involving other adults. But her mom isn’t dumb. No one assumes a 300 dollar new make up set randomly shows up in their bathroom that they “forgot” they had. Tell your boyfriend and his mother to call her out and to return the gift and then have him take it. If you need to use it to go out go and get ready at his house.
40,"Girl, go find someone who isn't so selfish. Life's too short for weak coffee and bad sex."
41,"Thing is.. fear of abandonment, but he has already pretty much abandoned the relationship. You can try to live with scraps to keep this human in your bubble or you can say, I deserve someone who wants to be here as much as I want them to be here. 

I did this as a much younger girl. I dug my claws into men who were MEH at best towards me. I survived on scraps and lived in constant torment and feeling like never enough because for whatever reason they didn’t want me how I wanted them.

Years later with clarity that maturity brings, I can see they weren’t all in because they were all messes in their own right and I had no business trying to build a life with them anyhow. They couldn’t handle it.

You need to just let it go and remove all the stigma of abandonment or whatever from it. It doesn’t make you unlovable, or unworthy that this one guy didn’t jive with you. Those are his issues, not yours. It sounds like you’re a good and devoted partner and he isn’t prepared for that kind of commitment. Don’t try to hold that against yourself. 

Looking back, it felt like winning if I managed to convince one of these guys not to leave me in that moment, but really it was a loss, prolonging staying in a really unhappy and unhealthy situation. This is a spot where you need to gain the security to choose you. He isn’t willing to go all in with you. To me, that says enough."
42,He might be cheating on you. My brother is like that with all of the women he’s been with. He cheats all the time. I had an ex that constantly accused me of cheating and I later found out he cheated throughout our relationship. I really think it’s a way to deflect suspicion.
43,"So ... he's happy taking your money to pay his bills, but not happy to take your money to go on a vacation?

On one hand, OK, great: he looks at his financial situation and thinks ""Man, it would be totally irresponsible for me to spend $2,000 on a vacation - that money would be better spent on all these bills that are piling up!""

But it's not his call ... BECAUSE IT'S NOT HIS MONEY. He doesn't get to call the shots about your money. It's really nice of you to pay his bills, and on top of that, to pay for his vacation with you. Want to have a vacation? Go on a vacation. If you want to pay for him to join you, that's super nice and way above fair. What isn't fair is for him to demand that you curtail your enjoyment of life because of his financial issues."
44,"&gt;I am a man of my word and I would have been there for you BUT you could have called one more time/ wrote yet another message / shouldn't have allowed Friends to stay / etc

I don't know what promise he had made but he obviously isn't a man of his word. If he promised he would be there for you, then he needed to be ""there"". Blaming you for not calling him, which you did, is indefensible."
45,"You do know that you are under ZERO obligation to stay with someone who makes you feel bad about yourself, yes?"
46,"You can't really build a life with someone you can't trust, especially on finances. How will you ever be able to trust this man enough to save for big purchases with him or do something like buy a house? You can't make your boyfriend change to be better. You have to be realistic that he may never change and grow and decide if you still want to build a life with him if he never changes.

OP, you may be waiting around for a long time for him to finally ""grow up"" (if he ever does)."
47,"Generally speaking, in the Midwest, a good deal is more  socially impressive than dropping coin on clothing and accessories."
48,"So who decided that you should home school all those kids, what type of qualifications and curriculum do you use? It doesn't sound like a good situation for a 25 yr old who has ""inherited"" all those step children. Why can't your home be ""homey"", it's your home too, does your husband get to make all the decisions ? Sure sounds like you'd be happier if you and the baby lived elsewhere."
49,"I'm about to graduate med school and had a similar schedule as yours. I do get the struggle but while I may be shit on for this but I honestly think you're overestimating how important it is that you spend every single hour of the weekend studying. 

I mean, do you want a girlfriend or not? You've been dating her for FIVE YEARS and she wants to hang out with you for one day on her birthday so she won't be alone. If you seriously can't spare a few hours on Saturday to go see some flowers then I honestly, not trying to be mean but seriously believe you should just break up with her. Of course med school is hard but it shouldn't be your entire life, and if it is to you then stop leading her on. 

I've met a LOT of ""martyrs"" in my class who seemed very stubbornly into the idea that it was impossible for them to have relationships or do anything fun, and almost seemed to punish themselves on purpose when there was rarely any need to. Are you ACTUALLY, literally going to fail this course if you do poorly on one quiz? 

Study for the final next week and study for the quiz on Sunday after you've hung out with her Friday/Saturday. If you'd rather make an A on every quiz than have a girlfriend so be it. I don't mean that sarcastically or harshly but that's the decision you're making."
50,"Your much older girlfriend doesn't respect and appreciate her teenage boyfriend, color me unsurprised. Yes, break up with her and don't try to appease her."
51,"I like the idea of redirecting and not engaging in the drama. My first instinct is to justify and apologize. This time I'll try being dismissive until she escalates, then I'll take u/christiangreyisdraco 's advice and ask her to leave."
52,"Good comments here. I'm kind of shocked at the audacity to say:

&gt;if it's apparently something I'd love to do myself(phrased as if I have never mentioned it before), it would be cruel to take it away from him because I'm jealous

So, she's asked him to go hiking a bunch of times, and he's refused. Now, his friends invite him hiking to her dream hike, and he's all...hiker-y all of a sudden? 

AND they've never gone on vacation together. 

AND they're doing nothing for her birthday next week. 

AND anyone who works outside the home and claims they ""carry the family"" makes my eye twitch."
53,I have to ask: why are you the one worried about looking like the bad guy when you are surrounded by people who have zero concept of other?
54,"So he'll judge you and throw you under a bus for wearing (he thinks) designer clothes.

And then he'll judge you and throw you under a bus for not wearing designer clothes.

He sounds incredibly shallow and immature."
55,I don’t think there’s really a need to fully disclose details until you are considering marriage or children together. You can deflect questions by saying things like you don’t have debt and that you live within your means.
56,"I used to work at an exotic rescue years ago and we took in 2 large tortoises. One of the gentlemen had his for 40 years and broke down sobbing the day he surrendered him.  A couple months later he called us and asked to visit his turtle friend.  If a tortoise could run he would, as each time the man came he would turtle run to the fence for a visit.  He and the other females tortouse ended up paired and mated and the man told us he could tell his childhood pet was much happier.  I know your sister is upset but perhaps you can arrange for a regular visit to the reserve so she can see his new home, friends and bring him his favorite treats.  It might help both of them with the adjustment."
57,"She needs space and she needs emotional support without practicality. 

Yes of course logically it’s best for the turtle, she probably even knows that in her heart. 

But she’s 14 and experiencing all of this intensely. It’s fresh, it’s new, and it’s probably her first loss like this. 

She doesn’t want to hear how much better it will be for the turtle. She wants emotional support of someone just listening, and not trying to make her feel better. She probably also wants some space too, as teens tend to do. 

If you want to help I would look up articles on how to talk to kids about losing pets, or how to offer emotional support. That way you can get some key phrases to say and maybe some explicit instruction on what not to say."
58,"His excuses are weak as hell. He's blaming you for ditching you during the birth of your child. It's all YOUR fault in every way, according to what he's saying. 

Pathetic."
59,"&gt; He came straight home and explained he was never into it, (and honestly by the text it doesn't seem as if he was.) He said it was just something to do. 

That's worse, not better. He risked your heart and your relationship for someone he doesn't even like. He's unfaithful \*and\* stupid. Stop focusing your rage on the other woman, she didn't owe you anything. Your boyfriend did."
60,"Have you explicitly told him, ""This is bad for the baby""?   Because it is.  This is not about whether you should be grateful for the good things your MIL does, it's about whether she should stop doing something that makes the baby cry harder.

Maybe if you frame it that way, he'll get that this isn't about you being unreasonable, it's about good care for the baby."
61,"&gt; 1) One of my new brothers privately told me that he was really excited to be part of my family and for me to be part of his. I had been worried about him not liking me because his parents did and had some confusing fears about being replaced. It helped to know that he didn’t see me as competition, but as a teammate.

I legit teared up reading this. Sounds like you hit the big brother jackpot."
62,"&gt;I get called a lying whore, cheating slut, etc.

I think you should consider devising an exit plan, this has the potential to escalate"
63,"Second chances are for people that recognize &amp; regret their mistakes, &amp; who truly want to improve. Second chances are not a second opportunity for an unchanged person to hurt you again. 

Your cousin’s parents failed miserably in raising her. Now they’re stuck with an insufferable adult that they’re trying to offload onto you. Realistically speaking, if her own parents weren’t able to raise a decent adult human, what do they think a younger cousin is going to do? They don’t think you’re going to fix her. They just think you’re going to resolve the issue of her spending THEIR money &amp; doing drugs in THEIR home."
64,"Not wrong at all.  You are the mom.  She is not.  

I would have a talk with your ex about how his young gf needs to learn her place.  She is greatly overstepping boundaries."
65,We 👏 don't 👏 sleep 👏 with 👏 people 👏 that 👏 yell 👏 at 👏 us 👏 about 👏👏 sex.
66,You absolutely did the right thing.  Telling her would’ve been a HIPAA violation which is a big deal and had anyone found out you most certainly wouldn’t have been able to continue with your pup.  And people need pups.
67,"Whether keeping your exes’ nudes is appropriate is sort of irrelevant. The more important question is how your partner reacts when you tell them that something makes you uncomfortable. Every relationship is different and together, you define boundaries that apply to your relationship. What everyone else is doing doesn’t necessarily have to define what you do, especially when something upsets you."
68,"Oh man - that's really rough.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an answer for how you deal with Harry's people!  Who are you?  You're Harry's cousin!  And if you're asked why you're staying with Harry, you're staying with Harry because Harry is totally awesome.  Just keep telling people that Harry is the best.  Harry is the man.  Harry's house is the best house.  Harry only, not Harry compared to home.  After three statements like this about Harry, any reasonable adult and even most teens will get the picture that you are simply not gonna talk about your parents and they'll change the subject.

Hey, how's school going?  Get every bit of help you can there!  Can you pull decent grades?  Visit the career office?"
69,"So you're pregnant, the breadwinner, picking up more shifts at work to keep your family a float, and the thanks you get is to be called a lying whore by your husband? There are so many things wrong with this scenario I don't know where to begin. Frankly, it sounds like your husband is the only one who has time to cheat, so maybe  keep an eye on him. Or just leave, you don't deserve to be verbally abused."
70,Seriously. Buy Joey some condoms and teach him how to use them. You can't stop it if they want if to happen. You can help them make responsible decisions.
71,"You're not overreacting, not even a little. You need to get out. Things will only get worse down the line."
72,"He doesn't respect you, you deserve someone who does.  

Girl who wants sex 2-3 times a day, welcome back to the dating pool.  You'll do just fine."
73,"Dad's not a ""pacifist"", he's a spineless coward with absolutely no bollocks between his legs."
74,"Why cant your husband take care of bill in his room? Look if there isnt room for the 5 of you in that bed you have 3 votes so you win the bed. 
I appreciate that you are sensitive about the stepmother position, which is great!! But even if you werent pregnant and your husband was asking you to peace out from your  bed I would say it's a serious problem."
75,"This! I know some parents might get pissed, but kids are gonna fuck wether their parents tell them about sex or not."
76,You aren't doing anything wrong. These guys just aren't being your friends.
77,"She's 7, she probably doesn't want to talk. Find fun activities for you two to do together. Make cookies, build a pillow-fort, color out of coloring books, play with blocks. Just choose a fun activity that you know she likes and invite her to do it. She might say no, but do the activity anyway and let her watch. Over time she'll want to join in."
78,"This is not good. Your SO no longer even discusses things with you and just makes decisions.You should point out that he doesn't get to make unilateral decisions when he has a partner and kids. He needs to discuss every plan ahead of time.

I also don't like his phrasing. He ""carries"" the family because he works!? I suppose all that childrearing you do is just for fun. No one person fucking carries a family, at least not unless you are a single parent. Now, it sounds like from that he resents you a bit. Did you both agree to you staying home? Because if you did, him saying that is completely out of line and you should remind him that that is the agreement he made and if he has second thoughts then he should sit down and talk to you about that. But if he likes having free labor for his kid at all times, then he has no right to ever say he is ""carrying"" the family.

Nor does he have the right to throw that in your face because he didn't think to discuss a two week trip with you ahead of time. It really sounds like he thought he would just sneak out the door the day of!! Has he shown other signs that he is over this relationship? Left out other more minor things? Coming home late and visiting friends more? More distant to you in general? If not, then maybe he needs a wake up call.


Also, men tend to start taking Sahm's for granted because they don't see the work being done and just assume it's not hard etc. One way to combat that is to have him do everything you do for a week. (He can either take off work, or do labor in his after hours). This always gives them a better understanding of what you go through and generates more respect for your labor and time."
79,"I agree with the other comments about contacting child services in your area, but does your BIL think all this is normal? You say he works 9-5, but is presumably there on evenings and weekends. Have you seen him interact at all with his son?"
80,"Your kids are old enough that they'll have a say in whatever custody arrangements get finalized in your divorce, and what you've described here sounds like emotional abuse AND parental alienation, which judges don't really like. You have a very strong case to insist on full physical custody, with unlimited visitation for their dad, but no contact with the in-laws. 

There are plenty of ways that your husband can see them without his parents around: he can take them on day trips and vacations, he can help them with homework at the library after school, he can go to their sports games or school plays or choir concerts or whatever, he can take up an activity with them like karate classes or rock climbing or something, and maintain his status as their Dad without exposing them to this kind of harmful BS. I've even heard of parents getting hotel rooms for their custody days with kids when their living situation isn't great. 

If your kids have to be mistreated to see their Dad, it will poison their relationship with him no matter how great a parent he is individually. And if he IS a great parent, he'll understand why exposing his kids to this kind of bullying is so harmful."
81,"He just told you not to take a vacation and instead spend the money on him.  Really?! seriously?

&amp;#x200B;

It's your money, and you are not struggling.  Plan the vacation and if he wants to go fine, but if he doesnt then you go without him.  He's a moocher"
82,"My mom always hit us with ""talk like you're (insert age here), not like you're 4."" when we were kids and whining. Very effective."
83,I'd cancel my name change in that situation. It's a pain in the arse anyway.
84,"I’d definitely give him the talk but DONT connect it to his new friendship with Kelsey, it may confuse him and his new relationship with her at an early age. At 14 their relationship is probably fairly innocent and if you give him the talk directly about Kelsey it could sway his view of her massively. All the best!"
85,"You should get it put into your parenting plan that he gets father's day, you get mother's day, no matter whose weekend it falls on.  That's usually the way I've seen it done."
86,"I would do it via text to (1) give time to process without an immediate expectation of response; and (2) for you own personal safety.  If it turned out he was . . . not so nice, it's best if you're not with him and he can't lash out over it.

Personally, I think I would want to know my date was trans prior to anything physical happening, but that's just me."
87,"&gt;I AM SO OVERWHELMED AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO

Call the hospital social worker and tell them that your dad was discharged without an adequate follow up plan.   Get some referrals for additional in-home care or a short stay nursing facility."
88,"&gt;she feels like he doesn't give a shit about her.

Well, his actions say pretty much that.  They say ""I don't care that you just lost your mom and that you're my daughter, I'm putting MY needs and MY girlfriend first.""

Look, there is nothing you can do or say that will magically make him see straight.  I think she needs to lay down the law and tell him either he comes alone, or he doesn't come at all.  If he's not putting his daughter first, why should she put his girlfriend first?"
89,"“I’m so glad niece is getting married and I hope she ends up with as happy and committed a relationship as the one I’ve had for the past 28 years. As you know, having a wedding is one thing, but making a relationship work for multiple decades is a whole different ball game. Plenty of marriages don’t last, plenty of long term relationships that don’t end in marriage do. I’m hoping niece gets both the wedding and the many years of commitment. So excited to celebrate with her!”"
90,"I wouldn't let my wife try to split them apart. I wouldn't stand for it because it would just make him hate us. I'm not sure if they're dating, but I guess I could give him the talk. I just know he won't like it. If a sex scene comes on in a movie he walks out of the room if I or my wife is there."
91,"&gt; He said it was true but she ""overdramatized"" it

What the hell is the non-dramatic version of sneaking into someone's house, entering their bedroom, and offering a massage?"
92,"She told you her feelings when it comes to the ""appreciation"". She doesn't ask for it and you do it because you want to do it. If you're tired of the lack of appreciation, then stop making her breakfast. I'm sure she'll figure out something else."
93,"&gt;*boyfriend humiliates me persistently and systematically, claiming it's funny*

&gt;I want to know if this is normal in long term relationships.

No."
94,"I do alright at school. Takes my mind off things. I'm doing my spanish homework right now. I've got this to do and then Math. At around 8 I'm going to do some studying for the biology quiz in a few weeks. 

I pull good grades. Harry's wife has a rule that I need to do at least 2 hours of studying a night for a class+ homework. I know that sounds time taking, but I have 3 hours of relax time."
95,"You break up with her, because she's being abusive and controlling and needs to figure her shit out before she's in any relationship."
96,"That's completely uncalled for by him.  Is this out of character? ""i dont like it when he calls me names"" suggests he has done this before."
97,"&gt;She burst into tears because she thinks the two of them are dating


I mean it's possible.


But why have a meltdown over it? 14 year olds date. Some even have sex. I mean it wouldn't be unheard of, especially in a year or 2 it'd be expected.


Why is she so worried about him getting her pregnant? Just make sure he knows about safe sex, knows about consent. Knows he can talk to you if anything goes wrong (like her getting pregnant!)."
98,yeah the reason why he keeps getting declined is definitely due to age because he has plenty of experience and a good resume. I should ask him to hang out more when I have time.
99,I have sat him down and explained it to him but because he isn't home with her all day he thinks I should just be appreciating the help she's offering.
100,"Holy fuck what a a pleasant person. 

You’ve been dating 4 years, is this new?
Sounds like he hates you."
101,Go back in there and have your husband sleep on the couch with the kid. There’s enough room. I used to fall asleep with my dad on the couch all the time. YOURE LITERALLY MAKING TWO HUMANS INSIDE OF YOU RN AND AS IM LAYING ON MY COUCH RN IM SURE YOUR HUSBAND AND KID CAN DEAL WITH IT
102,"So, I don't have a child but my two best friends are male (I'm a woman). One of said friends has a baby, and while I'm always willing to provide any support I can I make sure not to intrude upon Mom's space. If Friend ever said ""you're making my partner uncomfortable"", there would be no debate. I'd step back in baby-related things.

On the other hand, if I had a kid and my happens-to-be-male-BFF was over all the time making my life easier, I'd really struggle to ask them to come around less if my partner had a problem with it.

I think the main issue here is that Carl seems to be filling a gap in his life with your family, and your wife is going along with it. It's great that your kid has Uncle Carl, but this is worriesome to me:

 ""But he loves (daughter's name) so much - He says he misses her terribly!""

I would *never* pressure my friends to let me see their kids. My friends kids are awesome! But they're not *mine*, I have no claim to them, and they're under no obligation to see me. 

I think it's a good idea to talk to Wife and Carl and try to focus on the positives: say things like ""I'd really like to be the one to do the home improvement jobs around the house because it relaxes me"", ""I know Kid loves Uncle Carl, but I'm hoping to increase the quality time we have alone as a family"", etc."
103,"That update is so shitty. :/

OP partnership should be PARTNERSHIP, working together towards common goals. You're not getting that and if he's not willing to fix it the only things you can do are drop him or get used to having a man baby."
104,"You did what you thought you needed to do for her safety and hopefully she can see that...but being involuntarily admitted can be very traumatic, and there's no way to gauge how she's going to feel after this.

The most important thing is, you know she's safe."
105,"&gt;An absolutely wonderful man. 

You didn't say a single positive thing about this guy, and you listed off multiple extremely negative characteristics.

Lazy, shiftless, entitled, untrustworthy, stingy, irresponsible.

If he can't pass Intro to Business he is definitely not the sharpest knife in the drawer.

A dependent child.

Blames other people for his mistakes.  This is a big flashing sign that he's not ready for a serious relationship.

Whatever it is you see in him, it's not going to outweigh his faults."
106,"&gt; My first instinct is to justify and apologize.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

""Oh yeah, I already got a dress, no worries.  What about pizza tonight?"""
107,"This would drive me INSANE and I am a girl too. My god, I wish I could help you out here. Somebody above me suggested you question her, something along the lines of “why are you talking like that?” Which would definitely throw her off guard and unless said in a rude tone, would not make you seem like an asshole. It would seem you are genuinely asking because you have no idea why she’s doing it. It MUST bother other people where you work too, I can’t imagine many people not noticing it"
108,"The tough thing here too is that grandma May not fully understand Twitter and blocked in the context of Twitter means someone can’t see your profile but the word blocked itself is sort of a mean sounding one. I think you need to talk to her and stress how much you love her and just be honest. Tell her that you didn’t want her to be upset by language you were using, or something like that, and it doesn’t mean anything."
109,"""Honey, I know that you request the I join mommy groups come from a good place, but it just doesn't work for me. If you respect and love me, please stop.""

Then you can go into how there are other ways for you to learn how to be a better mother and how there are other ways to find play dates."
110,"&gt; My husband is not backing me up on this because of course it's his mother so now I have to talk to her without causing a rift.

The issue here isn't your MIL. It's your husband and his unwillingness to set boundaries with his mom. Honestly, if you and your husband can't get on the same page with how to deal with his mom, she will always get in the middle of your family. 

Has he always had issues setting boundaries with his mom? It honestly may be time for couples counseling. Why are you with a person who can't prioritize you and the family he is building with you?"
111,At least you found out BEFORE you have kids. Shit like this rarely gets better. And here's the really bad news: it's not that he can't control it. I'll bet he doesn't act like this with his boss. I'd be contacting a lawyer.
112,Can’t you report it and continue to denying being gay to your parents ? Being sexually assaulted by a person of the same sex does not automatically make you gay.
113,Dont know how to have that conversation without him feeling like I'm putting myself above the kids.
114,Wanting to sleep in your own bed is not putting yourself “above” the kids.
115,"When my kids were about 4, I convinced them that I literally could not understand them.  I would play completely dumb. They weren’t getting anywhere by whining. So they did that hilarious thing where they instantly go from a baby to an adult.  It was a parenting win. 

I still do it to other little kids I know.  Their parents are like “Holy shit!  How did you just do that?”  So they tried it.  It never fails.  If it does, that kid is either a serial killer or a diabolical genius."
116,"Why are you going to the same college as her? I think it’s important for your mental health and future relationships that you go to a different school and put distance between you and your sister.

She will very likely treat you this way for the rest of her life, so moving forward keep your relationships absolutely separate from her. Do not introduce friends or crushes to her. She has lost that right."
117,"It sounds like your wife has major issues regarding her jealously. 

I’m currently with someone who works away from home, up to two months at the longest. Without the trust between us, then it would be a nightmare. 

Your wife is making totally unreasonable requests that are purely out of jealously and nothing to do on your part. Her threatening to try and break up another happy marriage on what is essentially a lie, it also very distressing and is drama that is not needed. She also can’t make any demands about what you do for a living. I’m assuming you have been deployed throughout the entire relationship, or knew you were going to be, so she should have learned to cope with this fact. 

I say that either your wife acknowledges that she has a problem and tries to make a valiant effort to change, goes to therapy etc or that you should start thinking about how the relationship has run its course. 

I’m sorry you’re in this position. I wish you the best."
118,"Man perspective here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please throw the trash away. I always make sure that my girl is always satisfied when we are done. You need the intimacy, the sexual connection and if that isn't there, then good luck. Seems to me that he just want's to feel good and just throw you to the side, when he is done. Go out there and find a man  that can do this for you and make you feel amazing about yourself. Trust me, there is a lot of men that can do this. Hope for all the best."
119,"Really bad joke but I can see his innocence through it - I thought he was going to try and fake diagnose you or something which would have been outrageous but he owned up literally straight away. 

You have a right to be a bit pissed but not majorly pissed (IMO)."
120,"Yeah, 14 is PLENTY old enough to have had the talk."
121,"She needs to be reminded she is an adult and it's her decision to have sex. When she tried to guilt you, just calmly repeat ""You made the decision to have sex.""
And have a chat about it when she's in a better mindset."
122,She's taking out loans to pay her credit cards?  That has got to stop.  That is some seriously reckless financial behavior.  You two probably need counseling and your wife shouldn't quit her job without something else lined up.
123,I would be thrill to sent a night alone with my boy in his room. We can secretly play and stay up past 10.30!!
124,"Very bad memory of faces is common yet a lot of people who have no trouble remembering faces have no idea that it's a thing or how difficult it really is. The best thing you can do is sit your boyfriend down and explain to him what happened from your point of view just like you did in this post. You could even just send him the post itself.

I've always had trouble with faces, and my roommate is even worse (he sometimes couldn't even recognize his own significant other in a crowd), but a lot of people don't understand it and assume it's because we don't pay attention, or are lying about how bad it is. You need to explain to your boyfriend that you really are not exaggerating and you're not good with faces at all."
125,"You’re being PLAYED. This is ridiculous and absolutely unacceptable. He’s going on a week-long vacation with JUST one female. Girl, what else could this be? I don’t care if she is/was or isn’t/wasn’t a family friend, he is seeing spending money to be with her, on a week long vacation on your birthday. You’re trying to convince yourself it’s something other than what it is because you love this guy. But if you step back and try to see it objectively, you’ll see what everyone here is saying. It’s very obvious he’s seeing this other girl. It’s also very obvious he’s keeping you as a side-chick. Honestly, he’s probably just keeping you around in case it doesn’t work out with this girl. He’s spending money to go away with her over your birthday. How much more clearly does he need to tell you what his priorities are?"
126,"Time and time again, and throughout the entire course of history, only two things are certain: death and horny teens gon fuck.

This is why abstinence is the worst form of STD/pregnancy prevention. OP and his wife need to give the talk, the kid is 14 now ffs."
127,"Yep, my dad was the same, pathetic little man that put his balls ahead of his kids.

I have long ago got past this, as a parent to two girls I understand his behaviour even less.

OP move out and move on, minimal contact with dad from now on, he ain’t worth it."
128,Have you ever talked to your parents about how they met and why they decided to marry?  That would be an opportunity for you to ask about their age gap.
129,"How can you even be attracted to a guy like this? 

If you're not ready to break up, then please take all of the time you've invested in doing his stuff and instead use it to go to therapy, read self-help books, go for walks, and visit with friends. Your life doesn't have to be this miserable."
130,She was 39 and he 18-17 when she pregnant ?
131,"I think you need to think very carefully about what you are doing here. 

There is a stereotype that women must love weddings and that every women has planned her ideal wedding since she was a little girl. For many women that actually isn't true. I'm married and I wasn't particularly interested in the wedding part - to me it was just a burden that we had to get through and I was glad when it was done. 

I was very excited to be married however, and that's the important thing. 

In your case it might be that you just don't really care for weddings. Or you feel pressure over it because women are expected to look a certain way. Or you are apprehensive because your family are rude to your fiance. 

On the other hand, it might be that deep down you don't want to get married to this man. You mention that you are worried about how this will change your life and also some concerns about your career.  Do you think you are ready for marriage?"
132,"I think you have to talk to your wife about setting boundaries because it definitely sounds like he’s overstepping your boundaries and tour wife should respect that especially since it’s your house and baby as well. 

At the same time, if she says that she feels overwhelmed with the baby then you’ve got to help her out because that might be part of the problem. If you can’t take time off work then finding a nanny or a family member that could help out would be a good relief. 

When you come home from work just taking over for a few hours so your wife can have time to relax would be helpful too. 

I definitely think it’s a weird situation so definitely start by setting boundaries and if she can’t see why it bothers you then idk."
133,"&gt; If a tortoise could run he would, as each time the man came he would turtle run to the fence for a visit. 

That's....adorable."
134,"Try this, or something similar, you can back it up with the doctor if you feel like your need too.

&amp;#x200B;

""Honey, I love you and the kids so much, but my pregnancy isnt easy on my body right now, I know that fact that I can still do things and not have to be in bed ALL the time can be misleading but I AM on bed rest and for the most part I need alot of quiet and rest, especially at night or we're going to be making my pregnancy harder and thats not good for the babies I'm carrying or for me. I know Bill wasnt feeling well \*insert date here\* and your his dad and I've always respected your relationship, but you asking me to sleep on the couch wasnt okay. I need rest and I need to be in our bed. From now on, If Bill is having trouble I need you to go to him in his bed, I cant rest well with him in our bed right now, he tosses and turns and kicks, which is all normal for a 8 year old boy, but its not working for a pregnant woman with twins on doctor bed rest. Imagine if he kicks my belly in his sleep (if he sleeps on you side that is)"" 

You love these kids too, and 'Bill' is probably having some emotions about the new babies and is needed his dads reassurance that hes still important too, (something I went through when my mom remarried and had my sister when I was 12) But your on bed rest. 

When I was pregnant with my daughter, I was also on modified bedrest but wasnt getting the rest I needed. I ended up in the hospital on bed rest and having an emergency c-section 10 weeks early. I dont want that to happen to you."
135,"I'm so sorry, OP. Please disclose. Just keep in mind:
* Your sister will not be happy to hear that her husband strayed. Folks in her position often (inappropriately) react by resorting to denial and/or blaming the victim. Before approaching your sister, please be mentally prepared for a negative initial reaction, and be prepared to remove yourself from the conversation immediately if she reacts inappropriately by (verbally) attacking you. Please do not feel any duty or familial obligation to sit there and take verbal abuse.
* I advise keeping your disclosure as factual, concise, and bare-bones as possible (without omitting any relevant information). In particular, I suggest resisting the urge to speculate about her husband's possible thoughts or motives for what he did. His act was wrong, regardless of what he was thinking. Speculating about her husband's possible thoughts/motives would merely give him an easy opening to attack your narrative by claiming, ""no, I wasn't thinking that at all!""
* On a similar note, I recommend refraining from speculating about anything else her husband may/may not have done. That again provides an easy opening for her husband to discredit your report. I suggest limiting yourself to only the facts you know for sure.
* I also suggest that you refrain from making any excuses for her husband's actions. Trust me, your sister and her husband will be more than able to come up with excuses/mitigating factors themselves. You don't need to ""help"" them with that by, e.g., blaming yourself for getting too close to him or anything along those lines. You didn't ask to be kissed against your will. That's the bottom line, and that's what matters here.
* Please keep in mind that your duty as a good sister begins and ends with disclosing the truth to your sister. It's **not** your duty - and in fact beyond your ability - to force your sister to accept the truth of what happened.
* Once you've disclosed the truth to her, what to do with the information is entirely up to her. Please try not to feel any guilt or further obligation if your sister decides to ignore your disclosure and pretend nothing happened.

Again, I'm so sorry you've been put in this situation, OP. You're a great person and I hope your sister recognizes your bravery in coming forward to her."
136,He was negging you.  Your instinct to not waste time or breath was a good one.
137,The fact that he's trying to make you feel guilty for HIS choices would have me running for the hills.
138,"You go back to the courthouse and do whatever paperwork you need to do to get your old name back? 

That's what I would do. 

And you two need to talk some more. You do have a good reason to feel betrayed, and he needs to see that."
139,"I don't think he should expect you to spend your money on his kids, especially after only a few months together. 

But I also think it's natural that he would feel guilty and weird about being treated to nice restaurants and vacations when he can't afford his kids medical bills or treatment costs. 

If this starts looking like it's going to be a long-term relationship, you definitely need to have a discussion about finances and the kids and how much if any involvement you both want there."
140,"Dude knows you're going to stick around and do all his cleaning for him! Your options are:

1. Stay with him and clean after him
2. Stay with him, don't clean after him, lve in filth
3. Leave and find someone who actually cares about you and is not disgusting"
141,"It's been 2 months! Of course you're still not okay. I lost my mother somewhat suddenly almost 4 years ago and the pain is still there.


Has he ever lost anyone? It seems like he doesn't understand the process of grieving the death of a loved one."
142,So...what's good about this relationship?
143,"OP, just wanted to chime in real quick- I’m AFAB non-binary and I disclose that very shortly into my romantic relationships. It absolutely is okay to not be sexually attracted to your spouse if they’re nb and you are straight. And it’s absolutely valid to feel like you are now married to someone who is not who you initially married. There is a fundamental part of them that you both know is now different than y’all thought."
144,"But also imo, keeping nudes after a breakup seems like a breach of consent to the person who sent them"
145,"Just reinforcing here. 

The ""standard"" etiquette for these kind of international family things is for the host to treat their guests to some of the finer places in their area. 

Not to use them to buy beer"
146,"This same thing happened to me, except it was with a girl he had met at work... he left me randomly (there were no warning signs) 3 days before our anniversary... they now share the same dating anniversary and are actually getting married 2 years to the day we broke up. We were also engaged... he proposed to her within 7 months. Blew my mind. I'm much better off and you will be too."
147,"Honestly the shit he pulled alone ditching you to clean up for the movers should show you that he just does not care. He thinks it's your job to clean up around him while he sits around on his ass, and then he punishes you emotionally when you reasonably ask him to help. 

It creates a dynamic where he gets out of the work either way. Either you avoid asking him because you don't want the fight, or he avoids doing it because he 'wins' with his temper tantrum. This is not a partner, this is a dependent. 

People like this rarely change. Make of that what you will."
148,"Youre pregnant. You deserve to be put above his 8 year old. You are making two tiny humans and wont be able to get good sleep for months after this. Set the rules, you are mom, you need to own this. If he doesnt like it he can sleep on the couch."
149,"Hello: my husband just got back from two weeks away while I was home with our two year old. It was a unique career opportunity that cost our family money in the short term, and it was super stressful (I work fulltime outside the home) even with family and friends to help. The difference: we talked about it for ages, he strategized ways I could be supported while he was gone, we talked about how to make up the gap in our budget and he STILL felt super bad leaving us for that long. He’s continually expressed his gratitude and appreciation for my support and at no point felt it was a given that he could just pack up and leave for two weeks, even for a probably-never-repeated opportunity. If he had acted the way your boyfriend is acting, I definitely would be looking seriously at separating. It’s so disrespectful of your time, your budget,  of both you and your child’s emotional needs, and your connection as a family. Please PM me if you feel like talking about this more! I’m so sorry your partner is being so unsupportive."
150,"He is taking the steps to begin an affair right in front of you, while somehow bamboozling himself and you into believing it's not that serious. I applaud his level of self delusion, but you need to extricate yourself from this mess ASAP."
151,the fact that your husband has put his 8 year old sons neediness in front of his pregnant wifes pain is ridiculous. he can go lay in in the kids bed with him. and the kid is 8. he shouldnt be in your bed at all.
152,"Sounds like your mom needs to be on an info diet so she doesn't have gossip to spread with the family.  She doesn't really need to know all the details of your driver's licenses, job status, etc.  Tell her the highlights, the good news, things you want to brag about and keep information to yourself whenever possible."
153,"Kind of late, really."
154,"I mean what kind of asshat tells his wife with a very tiny baby that she is 'not a good wife and mom', seriously? Not someone in lime for husband of the year for sure.

At two months you should both be all hands to the pumps and be so tired you are just grateful that there is someone else in the world who understands just how tired you are."
155,"Age is definitely one of the reasons why he's getting rejected. However, its not always about age. It seems he has a long working history and skillset to go with it, but have you seen his resume? Maybe you can do a mock interview with him pretending that you are the interviewer and helping him refine his points, interviewers nowadays want to know very specific answers not drawn out rambling that old people tend to do. The last time he went for interviews was many years ago, he must have been out of touch now.

Its easy to feel down when all you do is failing. However, failing shows you are actually doing something wrong and until you fix those you would likely keep failing.

Other than that, you can get him to attend free interview classes, help with writing and improving resume. Last but not least, connections. He's been in the industry for so long. Does he not have any connections or references he can leverage on to get a job?"
156,Get lawyers involved ASAP.
157,"Definitely go enjoy yourself. 

What does he do with his free time?"
158,"Your PC, you paid for it with YOUR money, it's YOUR PROPERTY. End of discussion.

But I'd consider taking extra security measures until you move out (which you should do ASAP.) Like packing it up and leaving it in safe-keeping with a friend so they can't steal it. Also, write down all of the serial numbers and take a picture of your setup in case they DO steal it, that way you can file a police report and recover your property faster."
159,I will talk to my husband again and will ask him to talk with his mother and sister.
160,"You should be speaking to a lawyer, about the slander and the possible breaking and entering from making a copy of your key without permission. Also, get your locks changed."
161,Thank you everyone for taking ng time to comment. I'm sorry I can't reply to each one. Today has been crazy. I'm moving back into my parent's house and getting my stuff right now. I have an appointment with a lawyer for next week.
162,"&gt;So today they took him and she cried when they left, and it is now in her room quite literally crying and eating ice cream

It's been ONE day. Let her grieve. Her grief isn't maladaptive at this point. Even if she agreed that it's the right decision, it's still okay for her to feel sad."
163,"This entire event is because two adults *forgot* that this wedding is not about them. 

I think if a discussion with the father and girlfriend happens, they need to be reminded of what the wedding *is*: it’s a celebration of you and your fiancé and your lifetime commitment to one another. It’s not an opportunity to present a new girlfriend to the world or make the event in any way about anyone other than you and your fiancé. You don’t invite last minute guests, you definitely don’t do it without talking with the couple getting married and you definitely do not throw a shit fit when they do not acquiesce to your desires.  

I’m usually  a positive person but I have an almost irrational protective streak when it comes to what *should* happen on a couple’s wedding day and people who want to take a giant stinky dump on it. Your future father in law would be 100% correct to guess there would be a strained relationship if I were your girlfriend: if a long time family “friend” and new love interest invited herself to my wedding and then tried to pit my father against me? Strained relationship? She couldn’t even begin to guess just how much strain she’d experience."
164,"nope.  Stop doing his laundry, stop cooking for him, stop grocery shopping for him. Stop picking up after him. Only pick up your own shit. When its obviously gross tell him ""I've tried everything I know to get you to act like an adult and treat me like a partner, not a maid. Im done-Im going out for 5 hours-that is to give you a chance to decide if you want to clean up or if you want to break up. Im not lying the rest of my ilife with someone who sees me as his personal bang maid.'

then follow through. be calm and firm."
165,"Everyone else gave you great advice about bonding (I second watching She-Ra if she likes it, it’s age appropriate and all about trust and love), so I want to drop something in that might be uncomfortable but necessary to consider. Do you know her full history? Is there a chance she was mistreated in her past, possibly by someone in your demographic? 

If you’re not positive just double check with your parents whether they know of any reason she might have a harder time feeling comfortable with you. Hopefully this is just pure new-family adjustment, but if there was something like that contributing, it’s something to keep in mind when approaching her boundaries. Whether that’s part of the reason or not, though, it sounds like you’ve been doing everything advisable: respecting her boundaries, being patient and not taking her hesitancy personally, continuing to interact with her without giving up on her...she’s lucky to have a big brother like you in the family. It might take years, but you’re headed in the right direction."
166,"I can't really tell from your post how you feel about this. Yes, she should have told you in advance (and it sounds like you would've been fine with it based on how you're a little proud of her.) It also sounds like she really was doing this for wedding money and it was strictly online. 

If you can handle it and you just want to get over the trust breach feelings, ask her to show you the messages and what she's been doing with the money. Then decide together how you want to move forward.

If you can't handle it and it's a dealbreaker, then you know what option you have left."
167,"Hun, you  want to know why I will always feel resentful towards my otherwise fantastic mother?

*Because my father was abusive and she did nothing to protect me.*

What you are doing right now?  It's a kissing cousin to ""I don't want to take sides.""  You don't want to *take action.*  There will be consequences and you shy away from them--understandably, sure, because humans tend to be conflict averse.

Here's the thing.  The people who ""don't want to take sides?""  *They are taking a side.*  Even inaction is ACTION. 

You aren't sparing your children from anything.  YOU, however, get to spare yourself a lot by continuing down the same path.  You can wring your hands over the behavior of your inlaws and feel virtuous:  *you* recognize that this is wrong, *you* feel your children's pain, so you must be doing great parenting here!

Nope.

By refusing to do something that takes *real effort,* **you are siding with your inlaws.**

**Every day that goes by where you refuse to take concrete steps to get your children out of an abusive situation is you agreeing that abuse is okay.**

Do you, OP, agree that abuse is okay?

Your words are pretty and righteous, but your lack of concrete action says the abuse has yet to rise to the point where you are willing to make sacrifices to end it.  Going to court in any way, shape of form frightens you.  Own that.  And once you have owned that, gird your loins and do what has to be done.

Sure, your kids won't like admitting things to an officer of the court--who does?

You know what they REALLY won't like?  That moment when they are old enough to realize that you *could* have done something to help them, to protect them, but you were too scared for yourself to do anything.

And you can't walk that back with handwringing and claims that you just didn't know what to do.  Tomorrow, as I write this, is Monday.  Contact your divorce lawyer, or whoever is handling custody matters for you.  Spend the money.  See how to shut down visitations that involve your inlaws in any way, shape or form.  Do that.

And therapy.  Your kids need therapy."
168,How many times has he called you a bitch? Because once is enough to dump.
169,"I’m going to be honest with you man, I didn’t catch a glimpse of love in here from you. Are you sure she’s the one you want to marry?"
170,Has he tried structuring his CV/resume very carefully so it doesn’t reveal his age without looking obvious that he is doing that? For example having a section for “key qualifications” where he writes recent qualifications and gives dates for that and then “other qualifications” where he writes older qualifications that would reveal his age giving less detail including no dates.
171,"Her father is a jerk.  The idea of using his daughter's wedding as a platform to introduce his new girlfriend was the first sign and now he's made the wedding all about his new relationship.  That's what you should say to him.

Tell him that everyone will have to work on the relationship going forward and that he has to remember that this day is for his daughter.   If he never does anything for her again, he should try to make it joyful for her."
172,At this point you should probably just call CPS. This child is being severely neglected
173,I would add to this that it's usually easier to be angry than sad or scared. She may be focusing on this rather than dealing with the fact that her dad was in the hospital.
174,"Girl, he is a child. If you cant trust him even when going to pump gas how can you trust him with chores? Taxes? Holidays organization? House management? He dont even want to help himself, how do you think he is gonna help you? And your kids? Do you want to have a man or a 10 year old? This is the choice."
175,"&gt;have him do everything you do for a week

Sounds like this should be two weeks since he's taking two weeks to be with his friends.

OP, tell your SO when he gets home that you're going to go see your distant friends/family for two weeks this summer, and that he needs to figure out childcare/take time off/whatever, and it's going to be super cheap because you'll be staying with them and just hanging out and sightseeing and hiking."
176,"I'm not even sure it's cowardice at this point, just apathy. He *did* just leave them with an abusive mother until he had no choice but to take them in. OP is just so used to abuse that she underplayed his enormous flaws big time ."
177,"I am Belgian, from a small village. This behaviour is absolutely not normal. In our culture you respect guests, not name calling them, make them pay for everything. I would have a big talk with your fiance, and book a ticket back to USA. Also weird she doesn't support you more"
178,"As someone who has been disinherited, I understand how you feel. For those who are giving the OP a hard time about the money, it’s not about the money at all. 

It’s about the process of how the decision to disinherit was made and the delivery (whichever way you look at it was appalling for the OP). It’s about inclusion (or not), it’s about the perception of having no value (nothing to do with money) within the family unit, it’s about feeling very alone.

The suggestion to seek counseling is a good one and I highly recommend it.  Your feelings of being disowned are valid because this is an action that is punitive and much more to do with family relationships and dynamics than any monetary value.

In the end you won’t be able to change the decision your father and his wife have made but you will be able to make peace with it. Then you can deal with it appropriately."
179,"Dude! It's absolutely fine. Nothing to be embarrassed at all. You like her taking charge, and it's cool. 

If you want to reverse, then you initiate, but only if you want and not because of what x-y-z thinks."
180,This red flag could be seen from SPACE.
181,"It will ruin your abusive relationship? Good?

You can't take care of someone 24/7. He will not get better if you don't get help. This isn't a discussion. This is for his health more than even your own."
182,"Yea, not to make this worse on OP but what the actual fuck."
183,"If he can ""see both sides,"" why won't he explain her side for you?  He either doesn't know why she's acting the way she is or he does, there really isn't a way for both."
184,"Sounds like my parents neighbor. The wife home schooled all 5 children while the husband worked, we thought they were happy then one day she dissapeared. An the husband was forced to send his kids to public school. We saw her again a couple years later, she was much skinnier, and only came to get him to sign the divorce papers. Sucks for the kids, but it's probably for the better. No one wants to be raised by a miserable mom."
185,"Wake them up.  Have them take the sofa or the kid's bed.  This is just utterly beyond comprehension.  There is no excuse for kicking you out of bed.

Once you wake up in the morning, it's time to start assessing the state of the relationship.  Right now it sounds like in every scenario you are the one to sacrifice, to suffer and to be denied basic respect.  This is not an imbalance of power that any relationship can survive.

Yes, his kid is important but so are you.  Not all situations can be solved by a 'kid first' mentality.  Look at each situation in all its details.  Work out what the core problem is, evaluate if it's a need or want and what the options are.  Then consider the consequences of whatever sacrifice or compromise.  In this case, a minor inconvenience for him and the child is a massive imposition both physically and mentally for you.

Go claim back your bed.  Then in the coming days consider how to address what has brought you and your husband to this point.  For the sake of the kids, if not your own sanity, you cannot allow yourself to be the family doormat."
186,I didn't even imagine a scenario where I excitedly told her about the dress. I kept picturing the apology I was going to give her... You're so fucking right - I have every right to ask her to leave. She should be excited for me like a normal person.
187,"Depending on the type of lock on her door, you might be able to get it unlocked with a paperclip or something. 

Would your boyfriend consider involving his parents? It might seem childish but I would be SUPER pissed if my kid saved up money to buy his girlfriend something and a grown adult stole it."
188,"I would have loved to bring my partner training. Even if just to see how much it lights up my life and makes my soul sing. I’ve brought partners in the past n they loved it. So yea kinda odd he is being evasive, but honestly never assume. Just be vulnerable and have an honest conversation about it. Tell him how you feel and if he isn’t an ass, he won’t be upset and will put your worries at ease"
189,Honestly I’d leave. He cheated on you with a woman he didn’t care about and to me that says a lot
190,"Dude, Gary isn't ""losing it"". It's just that for the first time, his nastiness is directed at you. You've made excuses for this horrible person for years; and associating with him has undoubtedly impacted other people's opinions of *you*. 

Cutting him out is the right thing to do, and you should've done it years ago. Good luck with everything."
191,"Jumped out at me too.   I know we throw it around a lot on this sub, but these *are* the classic signs of projection."
192,"Ha! I just realized the line I have heard the most after complimenting someone's clothing is, ""Thanks! I got it on sale!"""
193,"I’d tell your dog owner friends. Tbh, I probably wouldn’t continue being friends with someone who hit my dog. I don’t hit my dogs so I’m not gonna have some rando screwing up our behavioral status quo with her hitting. And it’s beneficial for your friends to know why their dogs are suddenly fearful of their movements."
194,"Yeah, give him the keys to the street and do it tonight."
195,"&gt; We text every day and tend to text quite a lot, 

That might be why. If you're both always texting, it might be an annoyance having frequent notifications popping up constantly, especially when she knows to just check your messages regularly."
196,"If you are actively planning a wedding right now, I think the first step is to put the brakes on that. Getting married never, ever fixes existing problems, so you’ll be having the same fights when you’re husband &amp; wife. Once the marriage is on hold, you should have a come-to-Jesus talk. Go into this talk knowing that your fiancé may refuse to change anything or may promise to change but only do so long enough to convince you not to break up. I wouldn’t be comfortable marrying someone that is so dependent on his mom that he can’t attend his own doctor appointment without her. (If it’s a worrisome appointment, then he would hopefully want YOU to be there with him; if it’s a routine appointment, then he should be able to do that by himself.)"
197,"It makes complete sense that you find this distressing. When your father was a year old than you are now your mother had sex with him. Unfortunately, there’s not really a solution here (besides you going to therapy) but know that you are valid in your feelings.


It also makes sense that the gap bothers you more now. When you’re a kid all adults are the same, but now that you’re roughly what your father’s age was when you were born, you can recognize how disturbing it would be if a 40 year old had sex with you."
198,"&gt;I hate the idea of bringing my brother and SIL into this conflict and forcing them to take sides, but I'm starting to think that's the only way this is going to get resolved

There is no way you can go through with the adoption without getting on the same page with your brother and SIL.   Tell them that it's crucial for the three of you to engage in some family counseling now to prepare for how you will relate going forward.   Use those sessions to get your brother to understand how poisonous your mom has been to your well being and you do not want to end up resenting him as well."
199,"People who have affairs in their history are not necessarily irredeemably terrible. 

People who *stay in touch with their affair partners* while attempting to establish new relationships are irredeemably stupid."
200,... I’m kinda waiting for you to explain why you’re with this guy at all before I spell out why he’s not interested in changing.
201,"Listen, I have about $2,000 worth of makeup and I would know instantly if something, even a lipstick, wasn’t mine. Your mom is a liar and a thief. Get your boyfriend’s parents involved."
202,"Ooh, I didn't even think of that when I read the post..he's probably been going to that house every day, seeing if he could get in or not. This is the first time he's been able to find an open door. That is freaky!  Unless someone told him it was unlocked (which I doubt), there is no way he would have known he could get in that particular day. Unless he's just a super ""lucky"" creep and the day he just happened to go over was the same day the brother forgot to lock the door."
203,"I’m trans and if I came to terms with my identity that is literally the opposite of what my previous identity was, and what my partner was attracted to, I would IMPLORE them to be honest and just end it.

I’ve had people not want to date me because I am trans and some gay men or straight women don’t want a trans man and that’s fine with me. 

You don’t and won’t like what you don’t like and I’m sorry to say, but your relationship doesn’t sound possible if your partner is becoming someone you don’t find attractive and that’s okay.  

LGBT counselor or not, they won’t and shouldn’t convince of a stupid train of thought like “It’s the same person as before!” because it’s NOT. If they transition is any way through hormones or as you’ve said, more masculine ways, it’s not your cup of tea. You married a woman and now they are saying they aren’t."
204,"You want a quick tutorial on lock picking by an ex locksmith? It is WAY easier than you think, i guarantee your mom has a crappy lock on her bedroom :D"
205,"My advice is to:

- Move out of your marital home, but NOT with your boyfriend. 

- Get a divorce from your husband 

- Get into counseling. It sounds like you have learned a lot about yourself and relationships through this experience, but it also sounds like you still have a lot you are figuring out for yourself.

- Continue the relationship with your boyfriend on independent terms. 

Get a roommate. Craigslist is where I got all mine in my early 20s and I am still friends with a few to this day over 10 years later. You are not obligated to finish your lease with your husband and his boyfriend. You can do what I did in college and get someone to fill your part of the lease when you move out. They can go on Craigslist and find a roommate just fine. They're grown men and will not starve on the streets. 

Remain independent. You have a lot to figure out and lots of loose ends that is going to take time to sort through, and I just don't think that jumping into a cohabitating relationship simply because a lease is up and you don't want to be lonely is a good idea. Your current relationship situation is a jumbled clusterfuck mess, you need to prioritize YOU right now and figure things out on your own terms before moving in with someone. 

You can end your marriage without being enemies with your husband. Get a lawyer. Divorce doesn't have to be monumentally expensive. 

Your whole post is about your husband and his boyfriend's lease, and your boyfriend's situation. You are a footnote in the whole discussion. You need to get out on your own, get a roommate, and live on your own for a while until you figure yourself out and your breakup settles a bit."
206,"I mean, she takes advantage because you let her. Why don't you call her out on stuff?

As far as the dinner goes - if you insist on going, I would get a nice card and something small. (A magnet, perhaps?) And make it clear to the server that you're on separate checks."
207,"You can set up a clear boundary. Something to the effect of ""John was pretty rude at our house, and I didn't like the way he treated you. I care about you, and you are of course welcome any time, but not him. I don't let people like that into  my house, it's the one place I can count on to be safe and relax.""

She'll be hurt of course, and probably defensive. Just reiterate that \*you don't appreciate his behavior.\*  You aren't telling her what to do, you are letting her know that you won't accept his behavior."
208,"&gt;How can I get through to them that I'm NEVER sleeping with them, I don't ever want a relationship with them, but I don't want to embarrass them and I'd still like to be friends? 

You can't. What they are telling you through their actions is that they were only friendly with you because they find you attractive and hoped to get a chance with you one day. You're suffering and they're thinking about their dicks. They're not your friends. I know it hurts, but you're better off without them."
209,"My husband is in the 6th year of his MD/Ph.D, which means right now he's in third year of medical school, with one more to go. 

Over the years, there have absolutely been insane stretches for us. There was the several months he came home smelling like his Anatomy cadaver (it turned out the ass wasn't preserved properly, so he literally smelled like rotting ass for months). There was the stretch after his big ""sure thing"" manuscript was rejected, and he thought his Ph.D was going to be derailed or worse, utterly useless. There have been countless quizzes, late nights, and of course Step 1 of the Boards, which meant months of Firecracker and moaning with his classmates. 

Not one time in the entire near-decade of our relationship, from premed to now, would he consider missing something as important to me as a birthday. Med school is obviously incredibly important to him, and it's obviously very demanding, but his medical degree isn't going to hold his hand on his death bed. He doesn't sleep next to his medical degree at night. His medical degree doesn't cook him dinner. 

If your priority right now is school and not your relationship, that's well within your rights. But you're being a shitty partner to someone who loves you. So either you need to chill about medical school a bit (you sound wayyy too wound up about these quizzes) or you need to take a break from your gf, after leveling with her that school is your priority over everything else. 

I really wouldn't recommend that second option, though. By far, the people without relationships were the people who cracked the most in the first few years of med school. Life is about so much more than work, especially since I would imagine it's only going to get harder to find a partner when you go into residency."
210,"The kid thing is a total dealbreaker. You need to end this before she gets pregnant accidentally, and so she can find someone to have kids with while she’s still fertile. I don’t think there’s any magical way to tell her. It sounds like she’s thinking the same thing."
211,"There is a lot of comments in this thread about the age gap between your parents, and they are a bit justified. You are at your father's age right now when he was with your mother, and I think you would probably be put off the idea of a relationship with a man in his 40's.

However, from what you have said, the relationship between them is happy, supportive and loving. That is the most important part in any relationship and you should never forget that despite their relationship not being the social norm. Your parents were adults when they were together, and even if society might frown upon it, it is noone else's business and playing by the ""rules"" that society set isn't necessary.

As for how you yourself could come to term with your parents' age gap, you definitely should try to speak to both of them. Hopefully, you can do that as a family together. Bring up your concern in the most calm and collected way you can. You should try not to be upset with them, and let your parents explain themselves. If your parents are as loving and supportive as you have described, I'm sure they wont have a problem doing this. In fact, I'm sure your parents would have already thought about all of this for the past 17 years of their relationship and raising you.

Once you have spoken to them, it is then up to you how you would handle it. You may even want to build a closer relationship with her, or not, depend on if you can accept their reasons."
212,"Your mother is a horrible human. She's not convinced it's hers, she just wanted it and claimed it. She knew it wasn't hers. She is a thief. I hate that you are only 16. I'd never do this to my daughter, and I feel strongly that your mother is a piece of shit for a parent. Just bide your time, count the days, and make a new path for yourself."
213,"The building manager isn’t going to take this seriously unless you make her. In her eyes she can take her sweet time, drag her feet (ie not really do anything) and still collect her pay without a problem. Make yourself so annoying that she’s going out of her way to fix this, of course within reason. Start contacting her everyday he does it, or keeping a log of the incidences (time specific and verbiage if it’s not random) and start emailing it to her once a week as an update. Stay polite, and continue to just reaffirm that it’s disturbing and these are the incidences you can site.


Alternatively, you could completely go over her head and contact the police and start filing noise disturbances, especially if this is happening at night while you’re sleeping."
214,"There is no reason for two healthy unpregnant males to need to share a bed at the expense of a woman who is literally 3D printing two tiny humans your husband put there. I'm assuming the kid has a room and if dad wants to hang out with him they can either share the couch or dad can camp on the floor in the kids room. 

Where does he expect you and the twins to fall in his priority ranking for the coming months? Because one baby is hard and two are brutal and you're gonna need a lot more than ""little 8yo had a bad day so I cant do anything but cuddle him right now.""

Show this post to your husband because he needs a damn sanity check."
215,"Tell her now before she comes. That way if she flips out and starts blowing up your phone you can tell her ""Mom, it seems like this is probably not a good time for you to come visit. Let's postpone your trip for another time.""

Whatever you do, don't show her the dress, she'll hate it and make unpleasant comments about it and you'll feel badly or start doubting your choice. Just tell her that you found a great dress that you're happy with it. If she asks to see it, tell her that no one is seeing it before the wedding. Leave it at a friend's house while she's visiting so she doesn't snoop.

Text her and tell her you found a great dress, but you'd love to go shopping for a mother of the bride dress with her when she visits. If she's wise, she'll be happy with sharing that experience with you. But don't count on it. It's far more likely that she's going to be angry and tell you that she TOLD you she wanted to buy you the dress, etc. ""Sorry you feel that way, mom. I'm the bride and I chose a dress that I'm happy with it."" is really all you need to say in response."
216,"People who say shit like ""I carry this family"" are usually ignoring the fact that there wouldn't even be a family without their SO."
217,My experience as a smoker... you don’t buy a brand because it’s on sale u less you are a smoker of on sale cheap cigarettes and you always smoke the cheapest. Most smokers are brand loyal.
218,...and to piggy back this...DON'T SEND HIM NUDES!
219,"&gt;I brought this up to her last night and she pulled the same guilt trip of how o never care and **how I'm giving up on her.**

I hate when people say this. I mean, it's a terrible, manipulative phrase, and it's such a guilt trip. But sometimes, you kind of have to accept that you have to give up on some things when they're not worth it or when they're destroying you, and that's really okay. I'm not ever going to climb Mt. Everest. It's better for me to give up on that than to kill myself trying. In the same way, you have to think if it's worth allllllll of these sacrifices when nothing is going to actually assuage your wife's insane jealousy. She will always find something to blame and take away from you, because she hates seeing you happy when she isn't (which seems like it is always?). If you keep giving and giving to her and she keeps taking and taking, you're going to end up an empty shell, and is that worth it? What if your child grows up and becomes your wife or married to someone like your wife? Are you going to be thinking ""Well at least I didn't give up on my wife""?"
220,"To answer your questions...

The sellers generally don't act like they're real, but they don't out right say that they're fake either. It's basically unspoken knowledge that if you're buying a $2000+ bag for $40 from a street vendor... It's not real. 

They often are a precise replica of a real designer bag, close enough that you'd have to put them side by side and look at small differences in the color, or the exact size and kerning of the writing on the tags, or other extremely small details, to see a difference. 

They do have labels/logos/embossments of the brands, but I tend to go for things with extremely small logos or no logos on the outside at all because I think that huge logos look tacky."
221,"So you are having a breakdown in communication. Your bf could have suggested going to your gym because he didnt want to inconvenience you/ didn't realize you were trying to watch and get an understanding of his training. It could also be true that he thinks you'll overreact at seeing all the women who go to his gym. Either way, you need to have a discussion with him about jealousy, his training and everything in between"
222,If you interview well you can overcome preconceived ideas due to your age.  It worked for me - I'm 52 and just got my dream job by structuring my CV carefully despite everyone else at the company being much younger than me.
223,"&gt; But he's not their biological father, and **he's proven to be very reckless and untrustworthy**. 

Absolutely. And manipulative.

&gt; He accuses me of using the girls as pawns.

**They are your daughters**. 

If your daughters were older and you broke up under other circumstances, a relationship between them could be something you could consider. But this man has treated you horrendously (cheating, lying and gaslighting), and I honestly think he would be a damaging influence on your daughters. He lost all rights to your daughters when he decided to treat their mother this badly. If anyone is being selfish and/or attempting to use them as pawns, it's him.

However, be careful. As much as your daughters are still children, they have increasing independence that your ex may exploit. He may attempt to get in touch with them via social media, attempt meet-ups, or even spread lies about you to them (""I miss you, but your mother won't let me see you because she hates me. I didn't do anything wrong."") So I would tell your daughters the truth about what happened (as much as is age appropriate), and keep a close eye on their social media and their phones."
224,"Well, I called up there and at first they thought I was asking about a patient and said they couldn't talk about them without their code and I said no she works there and the woman I spoke with said no one with that name works there. I asked about the other unit and she told me she knows everyone who works in psych. I thought maybe she goes by a different name, so I started to describe her and the lady got upset and told me she had to go. I guess she thought I was fucking with her. I don't know what to think."
225,"It's really very simple. This isn't now nor has it ever been about you, not really. 

She had an illicit affair with your father. When you were a small child, you called her out on it. There's no way for her to pretend to you that she never did that bad thing. She can smooth it over with the rest of the world, pretend it didn't happen or was justified, but deep down she knows she did something most people would consider very wrong, and got away with it. In her head she can rewrite history so she's a good person and deserves good things. 

Except that every moment she spends with you she is reminded that she did a bad thing and you called her out. That's all about her hating herself and feeling guilty, and shattering her fragile false mythology and self image. It's not about you."
226,"&gt;  he explained to me that he wanted Ruby to get some ''life experience'' and stop being dependent on them 

Then she needs to go do that.

He's asking to make her dependent on you.  You could try to argue from that point...that its the same situation, just you instead of them.  You doing all this for her is still coddling her.

&gt; She started partying, drinking heavily, smoking weed and sniffing cocaine. This was a few years ago, but since then the drinking/drugs have really taken a toll on her mental health. She's still smart AF but she's now impulsive, paranoid and has these weird mood swing 

Honestly, she sounds unsafe to be around.  That could be another point.

In the end.....she's your freaking cousin!  She's not your responsibility.  And from the sounds of it your aunt and uncle refuse to accept their role in all this.  Again...not your rodeo!"
227,She expects a 19-year-old to buy her diamonds?? 🙄
228,"I'm sure I'll get plenty of downvotes for this but I believe it needs to be said.

I understand you're feeling lost but you need to move on with your life without her in it. She's cheated on you. She's allowed herself to form an emotional bond with another person and she's moving that towards a full on affair, which is going to lead to the end of your relationship anyway. If she's kissing him repeatedly she obviously has no regard for your relationship.

Yes, reading her private diary is bad. Allowing yourself to have an affair with someone behind someone's back is worse. She's broken your trust and she's actively deceiving you about it. There'll be plenty of people that want to focus on what you did to her by reading her diary. That'd all be really valid except it proved she had abandoned your relationship *first*. As far as I'm concerned, you pretty much lose all ability to cry foul when you're the one caught cheating. 

You need to move on, period. Own up to what you did but do not let her, or anyone else, turn the story around and make her the victim; she is not. Hopefully you both can learn from this and gain something that will make you a better partner for your future relationships."
229,It's also textbook emotional abuse. This is the exact same tactics of mental/emotional abusers.
230,"Sounds like you answered his question honestly and he was expecting, or hoping, that you would respond differently. It kind of seems like he was fishing for an answer along the lines of you wanting to have more sex and you didn't give him what he wanted to hear.  That's not your fault, that's on him for reacting poorly to an honest answer from you.  You say he has a low libido, so when you two do have sex who usually initiates?"
231,"Jesus, I love sex and the idea of being expected to do EVERY NIGHT like its a chore sounds exhausting."
232,"She’s on bedrest with twins, which means any undue stress is very bad for the pregnancy. Bedrest is a serious matter. My sister had her placenta detach and couldn’t leave the bed for weeks. We, including my youngest step-niece who was only 3, all could understand that Mama needs a safe place to lay down for her to grow the babies. 

Doesn’t matter if the 8yr old ‘needs comfort’—she needs a place to rest or she could lose a baby. An 8yr old also is far too old to be inarticulate, and quite old enough to be non-maliciously emotionally manipulative when he sees his step mom with an ice pack."
233,"These things can feel so small at the time, like even bringing them up after the fact feels kind of like an overreaction, but it's been my experience that partners who have ignored my sexual boundaries in those ways only get worse. 

He's 30. He knows darn well what you told him about what you do or don't like, and knows that you don't surprise someone in bed with choking. He's pushing your boundaries on purpose, and if it's occurred to you that he's possibly punishing you for things he's angry about, then you know how you're feeling about how he's relating you in bed. I'm not sure if that idea is coming across coherently in that sentence, but here's the important summation: this guy isn't going to stop on his own, blows you off when you try to talk about it, and you're feeling increasingly gross about the whole thing and worried you're seeing a really bad pattern. You're not overreacting, and I'd encourage you to get out and find someone who respects your boundaries because he respects you."
234,"For me this, 

&gt; He used to be in a long-term relationship with someone, but after that person left him a few years ago, he kind of clung to my wife 

and this is the most telling part of this whole thing.... 

&gt; Carl himself has given up on dating, so the chance of him hooking up with someone else and creating a family for himself in the future is 0.

Even if he 100% does not have romantic feelings for her, for the past couple of years he has been using her as a platonic stand in for a romantic relationship and he is now using her child as a stand in for his own family. 

Op mentions he has relatives willing to help, so I would go to them and get some distance with the friend. Not just because of OP's feelings. But because this dynamic isn't healthy for the friend either.  He hasn't been able to move past his breakup after years because he is just using his friend as a stand in partner. He has no desire to find a family of his own because in his eyes he already has that with her.  

But this isn't his family."
235,"Your boyfriend is an alcoholic with anger issues. Run. Run very far away, yesterday."
236,"That's not acting ""inappropriately"", inappropriately is giving her too long a hug and then nuzzling and sniffing her hair a little.

What he did is so far past ""inappropriate"" I'd go straight to reporting the behavior to the police and filing for a restraining order.  That's the sort of thing you see in the build-up of an episode of Law &amp; Order SVU.  Right before someone comes across her body stashed in a trunk.

I mean seriously, if this was totally out of the blue, I'd be wondering if he suffered a psychotic break or something."
237,"Dump him. 

He’d rather run errands than pleasure you. 

OP, you know you deserve better. Also maybe a better vibrator after you dump him."
238,"Exactly. The offer to give $ instead was never an option- it’s no different than, “let’s grab pizza, my treat”.  Like it’s a vacation for you, and you don’t want to go alone so you are covering him."
239,"On top of this, if the ex or the friend ask why OP isn't talking to them, *don't tell them why*.  They don't deserve it, they don't deserve your time, just let them fall out of your thought process.  It's better for OP and if she's feeling a bit petty know that it'll bother them for a while."
240,"&gt;My first instinct is to justify and apologize.  
&gt;  
&gt;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Just want to pipe in and mention that depending on how your parents treated you as you grew up, some of us end up programmed to respond this way. My parents aren't as bad as OPs or like insane narcissists, however I absolutely felt like I was always having to explain myself in order to get them to ""allow"" me to have or do the things I wanted. I'm 26 and now I'm trying to like ""break the habit"" of JADE-ing. It's hard. This sub has helped me try to understand this concept a lot though..."
241,Are you sure it's not the dog digging them out of the trash and hiding them under the bed? We had to have a trashcan with a lid to keep our dog away from used feminine products
242,There is clearly a lot more to this story that he is purposely leaving out. I highly doubt it was just that one simple message..
243,"&gt; but mom just told me that whether it was or wasn't doesn't matter because I don't need it.

People are not this clueless. If you buy a 300 dollar makeup set you remember."
244,"It's only been a month, and your girl is allowing someone else to control her. Also she loves you already? Come on man."
245,"Not even a little. I also have a bit of speech impediment, different from what your girlfriend has, but it still causes me anxiety. What you did was good no one should be allowed to make fun of other people for something like especially in front of their significant other. I bet she appreciated what you did especially later when she was probably over thinking everything. You did a good thing"
246,"&gt;feel very distant from him      

&gt;haven't had sex in age

&gt;hardly even kiss or hug             
 
Even ignoring the condom, it doesn't sound like you're living the dream. At 23 you shouldn't have to worry about these things, if it's time to move on you are allowed to move on."
247,"Its definitely weird and creepy and I agree that hes been grooming her. She thinks its romantic that he ""waited"" so long for her and thinks that their thing at 11/20 was fate and it means they're soulmates. It's all very worrying.

Luckily they will be having premarital counseling as a requirement of their church they're being married at. He is very against it but she said she 100% is doing it so that's one thing he's caved on."
248,"You did the right thing. HIPPA is there for a reason and you’re right, it was  not your place to tell her. I’m sorry she’s being that way to you. I think you’re right in that she’s projecting her fears/nerves into you. Hopefully she chills out, realizes the situation and apologizes. I hate fighting with friends. Give an update if you want/can. Good vibes your way."
249,"I think I might have misrepresented what I'm doing. I've cut contact. I'm not spamming her or trying to make her talk to me anymore. The first few days I tried everything I could think of, but I do respect that she needs space and I've since cut all contact unless I absolutely have to talk to her and even then it's only about logistics.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know why I posted this thread at all. I just needed to dump it out of my brain and examine it and maybe hear other people's opinions. I've examined my financial situation and I've made plans on how to move forward and I plan on doing it. I'm going to the gym to help with the anxiety and stress, I'm eating healthier, and I'm trying to find a therapist for myself. I'm doing everything I can to actually move on and get through this. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is just that I feel a lot of guilt about, what if she's actually in crisis and I leave. Everyone else is ready to just let her self destruct so they can pick up the pieces later and I feel like that's not what she needs. The other side is she won't let me help so I don't have a choice but to go and that hurts too."
250,"So he doesn’t want to be one of those couples that never have sex. But he’s also unwilling to do anything about it. That’s like me being upset that I am chubby while refusing to go to the gym.  It’s on the person refusing to do the work. 

I don’t think he brought up the topic to restart a healthy conversation about your sex life because he wouldn’t have reacted that way if that was his intention. A reasonable response in that case would be, “Ow, that stings, but I really want to do something about this problem.”  Instead he is a pouty, angry jerk. So it’s kind of like me asking my fiancé if I look chubby in a dress and then being upset when he tells me the truth.  Truth hurts sometimes. 

Maybe the way to approach this is to tell him you are sorry you hurt his feelings but your answer was from an honest place and not made with intentional malice. You can then say, “If it hurts you, then it must be bothering you. I love you and I want to help fix that. Let’s talk about what we can do together to get to a good place.”"
251,A 2 year old that’s that developmentally delayed needs immediate intervention. CPS.
252,Box up his stuff and let a mutual friend hand it over.
253,"Here's how you handle it:

You sit him down and you tell him that if he doesn't clean up after himself, you will dump him.

Then you stop cleaning up after him.

Then you dump him."
254,"This dude is a mooch. He doesn't care about the experiences you do, or about what you want, he has made it clear that he only cares about the your money."
255,"This so much, say things how they really are and then leave, dont even wait for an answer. You're young and you have your lovely dog, you can find your own family and friends to love and support you."
256,This is sick.  A partner who wants to tear down your efforts to improve is not someone you will last with long term.
257,This all seems very odd...you’ve only been dating for seven months and are thinking of moving in together. On top of that your boyfriend is pushing to ha e you get rid of your pet over what might be a hypothetical issue. Honestly it might be easier to just get a new boyfriend because it looks like the honeymoon phase just wore off and he doesn’t seem so great.
258,Stop making him cum. Simple as that. I'd just throw the whole man out. Sounds like a real dirtbag.
259,Get a summer job. Tell them you want to be responsible with your finances and earning some money and filling up your resume is your goal for the summer. Make this about your responsibilities to your education. Leave out the privacy issue with the new RV. They don't care about your privacy or comfort. They might care about your interest in getting a job.
260,"Definitely not unreasonable at all. Similarly, my dad has called me ""pumpkin"" my whole life. One time my boyfriend called me that and I was like NOPE that's weird haha.

I would just let him know that you'd prefer to have your own nickname/pet name. I'm sure there are loads of other cute names he could think of! You want him to associate this nickname with YOU and his love for YOU. Not you AND his sister, since that's two different types of love."
261,"You absolutely did the right thing. 

If you had violated HIPAA or hospital policy, they would have ended your association with them if/when they found out. 

Your actions preserved the most good for the most people. Because therapy dogs in hospitals are absolutely amazing for patients. 

I'm assuming you have, but just in case, have you emphasized that violating medical privacy would end your pup's therapy dog days? 

Just wait her out. I'm hoping, with everyone else, this is her own anxiety and that she'll get over it."
262,"That crossed my mind also. The term for it is ""projecting""."
263,"Courageous work and you didn't recognize it.

You acted like a **BOSS**."
264,"Oh god, this makes my insides squirm just reading it. I hate that shit. 

I was going to say ignore it, it's not your issue to fix. However, my kids have all gone through this phase where they adopt that voice for those kind of situations. One at 9, and one recently at 7.

I learned ignoring it was just prolonging the bullshit. I asked them to stop and they didn't. 

So, when they kept at it, I would simply say; ""I don't understand what you're saying.""

Over and over, until they got pissed and changed their tone to a more natural, albeit more chapped, voice.

It only took a few encounters to understand I was drawing a line by not engaging with it. You want my help/compliance/attention? Cool, not until we talk like normal people. 

Not sure how that would go over, but there's honestly no way to go about this with the intent to fix it without kind of looking like you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I really get where you're coming from, but if you bring it up to anyone above you, it's going to sound kind of petty. Best of luck, man!"
265,"It's like how they say free babysitting is never free when parents complain that their mom or MIL isn't following the babysitting rules. You are always paying for something even if it's not in cash. 

The trade off of living home is being under the supervision of controlling parents. OP has to consider if it's worth it or not."
266,"&gt;Also understand that your wife is stressed because of the move, environment change, and the fact she's seeing your son grow.  

It's very nice you put a bit of perspective from the wife's point of view.  To further expand on it for u/wife20_7, he mentioned the wife got a great opportunity at a ""big legal firm.""  Does that include long hours?  More stressful working conditions?  A longer commute?  It could be wearing on her more than she'll admit, and it's causing her to lash out.  Maybe her adjustment to the job isn't what she thought it would be, and she's scared of admitting it because Joey will be like, ""I told you this move was stupid!"""
267,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I've had dogs my whole life and those pads have only been used when they are puppies and not housebroken. Then they should roam the house and not ""stink.""

She must train them to go outside. It's not that hard to walk a dog approximately 4 times a day, especially if you only work 16 hours. 

In my relationship, whoever works does more housework. You're so lenient, I would have no patience for any of this."
268,get him out of the house and into volunteering work. when you have a job or keeping busy its easier to get a job. and the act of being busy will help liven his mood.
269,"&gt;He says that all he wants to do on his day off is relax. 

Well, no shit. Every adult would like to relax on their day off. However, studies show that men are socialized to think they have a \*right\* to uninterrupted free time with no chores, and women are socialized to use their free time maintaining their household and catering to the men in their lives need for uninterrupted free time. Women in hetero relationships, as a consequence, have many fewer hours of actual free time per week than the men they live with.

But basically, every day that you live together and you provide all the household maintenance, he is stealing money right out of your pocket. It's wage theft for him to abandon all his adult duties, that would he would have to pay for a stranger to do for him, and let someone else (you) do them for him for free.

I would argue from both the ""hours of free time per week"" and wage theft stances with my partner in your situation, and if things didn't get better, I might start charging him for my time spent doing his share of the household duties, because I don't work for free, ever."
270,"WTF.... YOU, my lovely, are baking 2 brand new babies, you are 7 months pregnant and ON BEDREST!! Not couch rest... And, btw, you are on bedrest for a reason so WHY are you running around going to the grocery store, picking kids up from school etc?? You are putting you &amp; your 2 babies at risk by doing all of this, and if your hubs is too selfish to see this the he needs a massive kick up the arse now!! What do you think it's going to be like when those babies are home?? There will not be enough hours in the day if he doesn't engage &amp; put you first.... because he won't be able to cope if, the Gods forbid, you struggle to get back on your feet after the birth. You are the priority right now... and right now, you need all the rest you can get sweetheart... 😍🌺💖"
271,"&gt;Oh, so she feels justified in STEALING your makeup because you ""don't need it"". To be honest, even if your boyfriend does somehow manage to find the receipt, I'm sure she will lie or manipulate it so she's the victim and you don't get your makeup back anyways.

As a parent I'm saddened by this parent.  Jealous petty parenting sucks."
272,"You two sound like ideal candidates for an amicable divorce. It doesn’t have to get all War of the Roses to end a marriage. Kudos to you for taking an honest look now, before resentment creeps in."
273,Yeah what's up with this? Working isn't an excuse to be just as neglectful as the mother.
274,"&gt;""you can have her this year. But you should think about it"". 

It's not up to her to let you ""have"" your daughter for mother's day.  You need to talk to your ex about this woman's overstepping and make it clear that she's not part of the decision making.

&gt;Mind you, neither of them reached out to me to discuss how I'd feel about her being referred to as ""mom"" prior. 

You can come up with a nickname for your daughter to use for her and refer to her that way all the time.  Your daughter will pick up on that and put an end to the ""mom"" meme."
275,"I am Italian, and even though you don't have a lease, you can still legally put her in trouble if you are able to demonstrate you are paying her a rent. are you able to produce any document? can you pay her rent via bank transfer for example? I want to help if I can"
276,"You should leave. You are a free nanny for your husband. He doesn’t care about your happiness. He is clearly selfish and domineering. 

Once you are put you can get therapy and that will help you figure out why you didn’t see that this guy was a human red flag. Good luck to you. You don’t owe this guy a thing."
277,How did your wife even know there was a text conversation to begin with if you deleted the size matters comment before she read it?
278,"damn I didn't even think about the evolution of interviews of a reason. he's had the same job for the last 25 years, so changes in that process have definitely happened. 

I don't think I know enough about his job to be able to interview him myself but maybe I'll look into some classes for him to take.

and as for connections, I'm sure he's already tried everything he's got or else he would've had a job by now. thanks"
279,He’s worked at the same place for 25 years so that alone would make it obvious. Then you usually have to state when you received you qualifications...
280,"This would be a great question to send in to the “Ask a Manager” blog, just in case you’ve never encountered it / if you don’t get a final answer here. No affiliation, only a reader. :)"
281,"Or maybe it’s jut “cooking” in kitchen together. She seemed very enthusiastic, so perhaps her comfort zone right now would be learning to cook and bake with you. Maybe that can be your thing,"
282,"&gt;&gt; however, he says we can use that money for him.

Hun, you're not married, but your bf is acting entitled to your earnings. That's not how this works. All of that money you're spending on your bf -- how is that moving you forward financially? If you broke up tomorrow, what would you have to show for it? What you have to show for it is a man who doesn't work and who is successfully guilting you into not enjoying the fruits of your own labor. The boundary should be: ""Person I am not married to does not get a say in how I spend my own money"" and ""I don't pay for things for another adult who I am not married to."" Go on your vacation."

Four months doesn't seem like too long or short a time to bring up serious cohabitation plans, and how that will definitely involve your son.

It's not a bad thing to bring it up sooner in the future if you'd like to ensure this doesn't happen again."
285,"Yeah, and his reaction is “I’d rather not have pizza and just take the $10 you would’ve spent for myself”. Think about if someone you’re close to and would get pizza for said this to you. It’s not right."
286,"Tell your brother that you need to talk to him about something important, in private. That will get his attention.  Then tell him your concerns about being outed to your parents, and that you are just not ready for that yet. (You are going to have to do that at some point, but I get that you may not want to do that now while you are still dependent on them.) Then tell your brother whats going on. Tell him you don't want to have some big confrontation, but that you really don't want that guy over there at your house. Ask your big brother to be a big brother and protect you. You are family. They may have been nominal ""friends"" for years, but real friends don't abuse their friend's brother."
287,"I find myself wondering if your boyfriend is such the committed, trustworthy guy he claims to be, what does he get out of these expensive trips to Vegas and Ibiza? How does he connect with his friends when they are so busy getting off their face and picking up women?

He's already trickle-truthed you about the fact that women came back to their accommodation at Ibiza so with that in mind let's look at his other claims.

All his friends drink and do drugs but not him.
He is happy to stay out until 5am with a bunch of munters while he is stone cold sober himself. At age 32.
He spends all this money on these trips just cause he likes to hang with the guys - who would be alternating between off their faces and severely hungover the whole time he is with them - but he's not partaking himself.

Pull the other one. It has bells on.

You already know he's a liar. He let that slip. Now he's trying to set you up to be ok about his next big time/money/energy sink into ""spending time with the guys"".

LOL sure.

You are correct, truly committed people show up, put in a few hours to catch up and then go home again. Very occasionally you might have an all-nighter but it would be rare. Especially if you are sober."
288,Why didn’t you say something when it happened.
289,"There is no way to know that OP, but if she was at the point where she was involuntarily detained, then you did the right thing by getting the authorities involved. Tbh, it doesn't sound like this person is at a place in life where she can handle being in a relationship and a break up may be the best thing for her and allow her to get the space she needs to work on herself."
290,"huh, good point there."
291,This is sound advice.
292,"Who could’ve imagined that a 26yo who dates teenagers, would be so childish as to *throw a tantrum* about her birthday gift not being expensive enough?

Hopefully OP can take this as a learning experience, to stick with people within his same life experience range. And that when older people pursue much younger partners, it’s not because the younger partner is particularly mature; it’s because the older partner is *immature*."
293,"seconded


It's fine for him to feel guilty or not ready to go on a vacation if his health is bad, but it's not fair of him to expect you not to go, and on top of that, expect you to throw money at his debt when *he* isn't even tackling it"
294,"She's your sister, call her out, she's being embarrassingly immature for a woman her age. But I have to assume she's always been like this. Some things I'd say 

""you got married AND divorced before me too! Isn't that funny?""
""oh, I don't think I could catch the bouquet since I'm not single. Maybe they will allow divorcées?"" 
""I don't know why it bothers you that I don't want to get married but stop making your daughters wedding about me""

But honestly you should still attend your nieces wedding, if you don't feel like calling her out, ignore her or avoid hanging out with her. Sorry you're dealing with this, good luck"
295,"&gt;It's more the fact that my parents raised me to value kindness and second chances, 

There's a difference between being kind and being a doormat. A warm heart is not the same as a week spine.

It is no kindness to your boyfriend to bring Ruby into your lives. It's no kindness to your employers to encourage them to hire someone unstable, unreliable, and addicted to drugs. And was it any kindness to do nothing to protect you while you were being bullied? The difference between being one and being a doormat, is that the doormat gives in to whoever pushes hardest- meaning that they tend to enable and doesn't support bullies and toxic people at the expense of decent people.

Unfortunately, I don't think you'll get much support from your family. They all seem to have more than a touch of doormat disease - notice how they never pressured Ruby to be not be a bully, but are now pressuring you to ""be kind?"" Expect to hear phrases like ""Be a bigger person"" and ""we raised to to be better than this"" too. Ask them where that compassion read

Make no mistake, your no Uncle is just looking to pass the buck here. How is she ""more independent"" if *you're* getting her a job and *you're*  giving her a place to live. He's just sick if dealing with her shenanigans, but doesn't have the courage to be the bad guy. 

Your parents don't want to be stuck with her either, but probably don't want to think of themselves as the sort of people who would say no to family. So pushing her onto you is  the perfect solution for everyone -except you of course. But you're the ""reasonable"" one, and therefore can bullied into accepting it"
296,"They are already both asleep. It bugs me because earlier in the evening I needed an ice pack on my belly for some round ligament pain and fell asleep on the couch for about 20 min to waking up to Bill with an ice pack and when I started to cry my husband said ""why didnt you just stay on the couch?"""
297,"Have you called her on it? “Why does Theo get priority? If we are staying with you, we should be able to use the crib. We planned this in advance, you knew we would be there, and I am not comfortable having my child sleep on the floor in the first place, never mind so that Prince Theo can have the crib.” Call her absolutely out on it."
298,Your boyfriend is an unemployed alcoholic with rage issues. RUN. Run far and run fast. You will not regret it.
299,"It took until I was 32 years old to realize I could get my haircut whatever way I wanted.

It took that long also to realize I didn't need to pick up the phone, that I didn't need to explain my choices, that even if I were to do everything perfectly and be a clone of my father in every way and be subservient to his every whim, that he would still be perpetually, clinically self-centered and *NOTHING* would ever make him happy.

The thing about narcissists is they train you to constantly think you need to get their validation and approval by giving you a sense of guilt and debt to them, by training you from childhood to never feel like you did *quite* good enough, and that next time if you try just a little harder, that maybe, just maybe they would drop you a kernel of praise or respect as an individual.

The only way you win their game is to not play. The only way you come out as a winner is to escape. You will never please them, you will never win, you will never get that long, heartfelt talk where they finally understand and respect you and apologize for treating you like a disappointing child your whole life. You have to accept that and understand that if you want to live on your own terms, you have to do the hard thing and start looking at them as a person who gave you genes, not a parent that wants the best for you and actually loves you the same way you might love your own children.

You don't owe anyone explanations for your own decisions. If you allow this feeling to foster and nurture this narcissistic relationship you will lose people around you, you will not be able to love yourself, you will not be able to love others and build your own life and you will become anxious and less of a person.

I'm a 40-year old man and my life was wrecked by a narcissistic father but I didn't know even a shred of peace until I stopped responding to him and got some therapy and changed my phone number. People who seek to control you won't have less than that. That's the nature of abusers."
300,"Yeah, I'm sorry, but your mother sounds like a narcissistic sociopath. I can't believe she is willing to trade your relationship for a set of makeup. I don't think that loss of trust can ever be fixed, but if you never get the makeup back, you'll at least know what kind of a person your mother is. It's a shitty exchange, but it's also a headsup for you. Good luck."
301,"His behavior is abusive and all your friends can see it. Don’t be embarrassed that he mistreats you, be embarrassed you put up with this and dump him."
302,This and I would pack his stuff up and deliver it to her house. Send him a text to let him know he can find his belongings at her house and then never talk to either of them again.
303,"That's rough. It sounds like the best route is a modified custody agreement, with your children testifying about what they've experienced at their grandparents' house. There are so many ways for him to stay involved in their life without exposing them to that kind of mistreatment. 
Separately, you sound like a great mom who's really committed to advocating for her children's needs and respecting them as individuals, and I hope you know that, no matter what their grandparents do to them, you are doing your kids a world of good by sticking up for them."
304,"I'm also a mandated reporter. Please let me clear up some confusion you have. If your therapist heard something and decided she needed to report it then it IS bad enough and it DOES constitute abuse. I understand that you are doing everything you can to minimize whatever she's done, but if a mandated reporter has told you they are legally required to report it then it IS ""that bad."" Full stop."
305,"Melissa is drama. That means he has to be extra mindful of boundaries with her. That’s it. He can understand. 

She doesn’t treat you kindly, she’s booting people from her wedding party and oversteps with your husband. She’s drama. And if he’s smart he will shut down the intimate conversations."
306,"When someone does something nice for you, you should thank them even if you didn't actually ask for/want that thing. 

BUT, imagine her doing something for you that you didn't care about (making the bed every day when you've never cared about making the bed, for instance). Yes it's a nice thing and you might say ""thanks"" the first few times to be polite but do you really have to gush and thank her EVERY single morning for making the bed when you don't even give a shit if the bed is made? I would say no. 

She clearly doesn't care about getting breakfast in bed. Yet you insist on doing it every single morning, and get upset when she isn't appreciative. If you think she's an unappreciative partner in general then talk about that. If its just this one thing then just stop making her breakfast in bed."
307,Why on earth are you paying for everything? Is this a cultural expectation? Why doesn't your fiancee pay? I would stop that immediately.
308,"That's the difference right there.  From what I've been told, some Beijing fakes are art in and of themselves, and not the cheaply-made knockoffs you think of in the US.  I've known people who travel there *just* to go shopping for designer copies.

Maybe your boyfriend isn't aware of this and now associates your clothes with embarrassingly poor-quality and tacky New York knockoffs, but it's still shallow of him.  Tell him if he wants to buy you an entirely new wardrobe of the real things, he can, but otherwise you're going to spend money on the clothes that you want, just as he does."
309,"&gt;&gt;Due to me being the only working one, I’ve been picking up extra shifts at work to save up money

And he isn't working because?

Your husband is probably cheating on you with all the non-working time he has on his hands."
310,"And she's not their mother.  I think treating the kids to things when they're with them is fine but therapy and treatments are the parents issues, not OP's.  I feel badly for the parents and kids but OP is not a co-parent.  I can't imagine signing myself up to take on the burden of co-supporting the three kids for life.  It might even mean if they have their own kid, that kid would be short-changed because of the needs of the other kids.  The SO needs a better paying job."
311,"Go on your own and take that time to reevaluate whether or not you want to be in a relationship with someone who so brazenly expects to mooch off you. This is your money and it's not his right to dictate how you spend it, especially when he is expecting you to forgo a fun experience in order to pay his debts."
312,"Right now you just need to work on changing your narrative. You describe him as your wonderful boyfriend, but he isn’t a wonderful boyfriend. He won’t say he loves you and you barely get told you’re liked. He isn’t wonderful. Start that narrative. He isn’t wonderful."
313,"Honestly, who else does he think took the piggy bank? 

Write out a list of things that have gone missing. When it’s in front of his face, it feels a lot more concrete. Then ask him where he thinks she’s getting money. Then ask him where he thinks she’s going to be in 5 or 10 years. If it’s “on your couch”, then you have your answer. 

And yes to security cameras. Put some where she can’t see them. Especially your son’s room."
314,"Frankly he doesn't seem to respect you as a person or view you as an equal, and I would suggest therapy, 

but also, remember that you deserve a partner who can at least give you the basic respect and empathy that one working person would give to another."
315,"What your bf is doing isn't cool... And if I were you, I would watch out for more behavior like this. 

Why are two 30ish year olds dating girls who are 20/21? I don't like to invoke social norms but this raises a red flag to me. I'm in my late 20s, and I've been in my early 20s. There is a big difference and relationships like this seem to innately carry a big power imbalance."
316,"This definitely sounds like a weird situation to me.  It's like they have 3 adults running their household.  Only one of them is okay with that situation, therefore it's not okay."
317,"Married 27 years. My husband and I never call each other names. Ever. 

You’re telling this guy not to do something because it bothers you. And he keeps doing it. Repeatedly. Come on, OP. My four-year-old nephew knows better than that. 

My suggestion? However much this guy weighs, you should lose exactly **that** amount of weight. By dumping his immature ass."
318,I am going to let her make that decision but will support her either way.
319,"And honestly it should be a series of talks, not just one. You should keep talking about it and be available for questions!"
320,"Yeah, I got that feeling too. I imagine there is a whole lot more to this and OP is minimizing his behavior so he can get validation that his wife is being crazy.

Most times, when the OP writes a post that includes sparse details, they're not being honest about the whole situation. Especially when they admit to a tiny thing that is bordering on inappropriate, but not quite there. That is a super common manipulation tactic; admit to a tiny thing so you appear honest, and then people don't look any deeper. 

I am thinking OP has more of a history with this colleague than he's letting on, and his wife was *already* upset about it, and then the ""size matters"" comment + the deleted messages is what pushed it over the edge."
321,"I considered that but I've seen their stance on the victims of molestation in the catholic church and in the michael jackson situation, and they'd definitely think Im gay :("
322,"&gt; ~~Kind of~~ Years late, really.

Irre-fucking-sponsibly late. God damn, dad, what the fuck? You haven't had the talk with your 14 year old?"
323,"I'm a lesbian who had male partners during my denial/confused phase, and it felt a bit invalidating that my partners had such a different attitude towards me finding a woman on the side than they did towards the hypothetical of me seeing another man. It was like they didn't consider lesbian sexuality to be as real as heterosexuality, or even that they were fetishizing it. Honestly I think it hurt my ability to take my own sexuality seriously. 

I relate to so much of what you talked about here, from not understanding how your female friends can be attracted to men to the feelings of guilt and like you're living a lie. Even though I deeply loved and cared about the last man I dated, and we discussed my confusion thoroughly and thought we had it all worked out, I could never shake the feeling I was doing something wrong and false. Eventually those feelings grew more and more intense until they became agony. Breaking up with him was one of the hardest things I ever did because I felt like he'd only ever been kind to me and he didn't deserve to be hurt by me. But you can't stay inside a lie of a relationship just to save your boyfriend's hurt feelings. He deserves to have a girlfriend who can be sexually attracted to him.

Internalized homophobia is a fucking headtrip. I spent so many years so terrified of being a lesbian I was willing to do anything to convince myself that I had romantic and sexual attraction to men. It's crazy to me how many lesbians share my story and your story.

PM me any time if you want to talk. It took me an entire year to sum up the courage to face the truth and break up. If I'd just been braver about how breakups will always hurt, I could have saved a lot of his time and my own."
324,"\&gt;“While I am biologically a woman, I was born as a man,” or, “I’m transitioning to female in a biological sense, but am a woman and have always been.”  


This is confusing.  I think the original comment was better.  Modern medical procedures don't give MtF trans folks wombs and the like (""biologically a woman?""), and we don't know OP's past ops or plans for transitioning operations.  IMO, this line of thought makes things complicated very quickly, and is more likely to turn someone away."
325,"Exactly!! He can sleep in his sons bed with him. 
Pregnant Mumma (&amp; with twins) trumps all!"
326,"You shouldn't even have to think twice about taking Lucy off of the pick up list. You need to get the school staff member to make an official statement verifying everything they told you, and that needs to be with your lawyer like right now. Work on getting your court order amended so it specifies who is and who really really isn't allowed around your kids - if your children's father is as good a dad as you think, he'll prioritise seeing his children over his new wife."
327,"Is home school the beast choice for you? That's a lot of interaction, a lot of work, and almost no break. I think what you're feeling is more normal than you think. I know I wouldn't be able to make it."
328,"So here's the thing. Everyone is trying to make your boyfriend out to be a bad person here. I don't think that's the case. 

I've personally dated the trust fund baby that didn't try to make his own way. You know what he did? He ran out of money, and I had to teach him how to manage what little he made when he got a job. Your boyfriend seems to be good with managing his money, good at budgeting, and so he has a safety net for you both. You seem to be a giving person. He tried to suggest cheaper options that wouldn't require you spending money, and you took him out anyway, and that's not something that he should be villainized for or you should feel bad about. 

If he starts dipping into that savings and spending it on things like video games and expensive cars, I'd bring up issue with him not going 50/50 on rent. But as you're both living on what you bring in, I'd keep that dynamic going. It'll be good for the health of your relationship moving forward-- and then when you're married, you can use the money as you two see fit."
329,"&gt; This is the first time he's been able to find an open door.

Or the first time someone was in the house/woke up to him being there."
330,"Your therapist is a mandated reporter.  That means that if she becomes aware of the possibility that a child may be in an unsafe environment, she is legally required to report it.   That's the law.

You and your boyfriend may not think things are ""that bad"" but that's why there are professionals tasked with evaluating the truth.    If your boyfriend asks, tell the truth and let the process proceed.   Your already know that the mother in this case doesn't like you and so does your boyfriend.  Just deal with the consequences as they arise."
331,"I think this is a winning choice.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t understand that, can you repeat it?”

“You hurd your widdle teeny tiny...? Sorry, can you repeat?”

The more they have to repeat the nonsense, the more uncomfortable thet’ll Become."
332,"I’m shocked you’d classify these as minor resentments. He sounds insufferable. The guy who gains 100 pounds, is quasi choking to death in his sleep every night, and perpetrates small but pointed acts of cruelty also has the nerve to criticize the way you dress and act as the self appointed white glove dust police? Um. I’d ratchet those minor resentments up to a much more meaningful category of grievance.

More importantly perhaps, why would you tolerate this? I know it’s often easy to sink into a groove where things like this accrue to create an odd kind of baseline, but...yikes. Are you uncomfortable telling him to back the eff off? To get his own house in order before taking pot shots at yours? For some reason he’s given himself license to behave this way, and it’s unacceptable, and it’s shitty, and you deserve better. The next time he finds something to criticize about you, perhaps you should rejoin with one of these beauties, there certainly seems to be no shortage of choices.

P.s. there’s something so incredibly infuriating to me about people who have no problem ruining someone else’s sleep and then have the gall to pout and sulk when, for fucking self preservation, the other person takes some basic steps to keep from keeling over dead of exhaustion. He can destroy his health, but he doesn’t get to take you down with him. End sermon. Go in peace."
333,"Wtf? Why does your husband have this amount of disdain for you? 

Was this a planned pregnancy? Is there some kind of lingering resentment? Because this is not normal behavior of a man towards his pregnant wife - I don’t care how close he is with his son."
334,"You put thought, time and effort into your gift. You are in no financial position to give diamonds and would even be foolishly damaging your future to do so.

Let's break down a few more facts: 
   you didn't get to give this to her, she found it by going through your drawers (why was she doing that?), 
   she hasn't been honest with you about how she feels about this gift but has told friends who have told you, 
   she supposedly cried for hours about a gift, 
   she believes she deserves diamonds when you are working two jobs. 

Don't give her expensive stuff- you would just be buying a little peace until she decides she wants more. 

Take a deep look at your relationship and what kind of person you want to be with. Is she it?"
335,Talk to your fiancee about how you're feeling and ask her to stick up for you with her family. It's on her to make sure her family treats you with respect.
336,"The first thing I wouldn’t like is that ‘I’m not a sucker’ comment, that’s just kind of aggressively nasty and uncalled for. Second, what a doofus. It sounds like not a single person there was anything but sort of impressed by your clever back alley foraging so this is all your bf’s stupid issue. Let him be humiliated, how freaking absurd, btw, you just keep on doing you. This is all his problem, not yours."
337,"Building on this, look where you find any Japanese foods for candy kits. They have some chocolate ones like Cookin' Make Kinoko No Yama where you make chocolate mushrooms out of white, strawberry, and milk chocolate. They’re cheap and girly self contained if for whatever reason you can’t do other things with her. Depending on the kit she’ll need you to translate the instructions (you can usually find them in English online)."
338,"You stay way the hell away from this situation. ""I'm not the father, no way I could be the father, you're mistaken, please leave me alone""."
339,"You should see a reply I recently wrote elsewhere but the gist is: for every mother who has to work to support her kids, there are two women who can't work right now because the family can't afford the cost of daycare and/or babysitting.

Of course he would have to agree to the last part. I wasn't suggesting you just dump it on him. But just sitting down and saying ""I don't believe you know just how much work I do and I would appreciate it if you found some time to do even half of what I do everyday to give you a better appreciation and respect for me and my job. Childrearing is not easy and neither are everyday chores especially when I am doing the work for three.""

Some men will do it just because they are so sure you are exaggerating and want to prove how wrong you are and how easy it is."
340,"Call when she's supposed to be working and ask for her. If she works there, shell answer and you can bring her food or coffee or something.  If she doesn't theres a communication error in your relationship."
341,"I'mma be honest, her comment about you getting an enlargement surgery, whether it was a joke or not, was kind of a dick thing to say. 

Idrk what to tell you except explain it as un-accusatory as physical possible. If she can't understand it, that's her problem, and she needs to understand that when something makes you uncomfortable it's really spiteful to act as if you are attacking her."
342,"What do you mean ""fair""? There is no ""fair"" here. Your money is your money and he needs to get his unemployed ass a job."
343,"My wife joined some of those mommy-kidlet groups when our children were young but they never led to real friendships. It wasn't until our children were old enough to make their own friends and then we got to know their parents that we finally had parent-friends. These friendships developed organically and naturally.

&gt; My husband hasn't had as much trouble finding friends who fit a family lifestyle, one of his buddies from college has a 5 year old girl, and some of his work friends have young kids too.

Great! Then invite those people over and see how things develop."
344,"So basically, you supported him through med school and his residency, and now that he's a fully-trained (or close to being so) physician, he's emotionally cheating on you because that's something he can fit into his hectic schedule. (And seriously - if he's that depressed over his music, WTF did he go to med school for?)  Of course he doesn't want to break up with you - I bet you take care of all the domestic stuff for him so he never has to worry about grocery shopping/food-prep or doing laundry or cleaning the house.

Classy.  Super classy.  Kick him out - you should not be forced to find a new place if you can afford where you're living on your own.  You have lit yourself on fire to keep him warm, and in return, he's erasing you for a fantasy.  You are putting far more energy into this relationship and his mental health than he is, and you deserve better."
345,"Yo, this. This woman is wilfully and maliciously trying to replace you in your children’s lives and isn’t pulling her punches.  Don’t be afraid of appearing as a bitter ex— this is serious. Document everything. Send photos of it to your ex husband and tell him to ask your kids what Lucy said. If you live in a one party consent state for recording calls and conversations, record everything. This woman is out to get you."
346,"I'm wondering what his redeeming qualities are too. 24 years old, unemployed, alcoholic, lives with his mom, and throws tantrums over video games. He sounds like a total loser."
347,"To be clear, your ""BF"" is sexually assaulting you.

Before you get on my case for being extreme, he is performing sexual acts that you have not consented to. That is sexual assault.

Make it clear with him that if he ever engages in any sexual act that you have not consented to, if he ever ignores the your ""No"" again, you will dump him. (You should also file a sexual assault charge with the police, though I doubt it will go anywhere.)

And yes, you do need to dump him, because if he is not willing to respect your boundaries, he does not respect you. If he does not respect you, he does not love you."
348,"Your father is a weak personality, without self-awareness or self-confidence. He craves respect, but does neither deserve nor get it. So he's playing the role of tyrant at home, instilling fear as a surrogate of earned respect among those he has under his thumb.

&gt;He gave a 30 minute lecture and tells me how I need him and the world doesn't care about me, then walked out of the room.

He has to make you feel small to appear big in comparison.

Since for now you are dependent of him, your only option is to play along for the time being and get independent as soon as possible. Good luck."
349,"It sounds like she needs professional help and rather than figure out why she is unhappy or what she can do about it she projecting her insecurities and anxieties on to you and trying to solve them by making you solve them. I would encourage her to see a therapist or start up couples counseling together before doing anything else. The more you enable her to externalize her feelings or give in to her demands, it means she won't learn to self soothe and will continue to escalate her demands of you."
350,this is the only answer. domestic violence that starts during pregnancy is very likely to get much worse very quickly.
351,"Never JADE (I believe Justify, Apologize, Defend, Explain). It's your wedding, if you wanted to get married in a trash bag she'd just have to deal with that."
352,"This is exactly right.  She is having an emotional experience and to help her respond with emotion.  If you respond to an emotional experience with logic, it will make her feel misunderstood (which would be accurate in this case).

&amp;#x200B;

""Susan, I am so sorry,  I know that losing Fred is horrible for you.  I'm here for you.  Can I give you a hug?""    ""Susan, I wish I could help more.  Sometimes it can be really painful to do the right thing.  I just want you to know I am in your corner and ready to help if I can."""
353,"Run your full credit report asap. Unfortunately, in situations like this parents get desperate and put bills im their children's name. 

Next step would be to separate any joint accounts you have with them. Full zero financial connections to your parents.

Their money problems are not your money problems. They are adults and can clean up their own mess."
354,"Why can't he sleep with his son in the son's bed?  If the son's bed is too small, tell SO to get a bigger bed as you will no longer ever be sleeping on the couch in your own home.  He can buy an air bed if you don't have the funds for another bed or the space.  You will not put your body on that couch ever again.  Please hear me.  Never, ever again.  If you come to bed and he's already set up with son, tell him to move to son's room, you need a comfortable bed tonight.

What he's gonna do with the twins, put them on the couch too with you?  No.  Your hill to die on.  You're not saying he can't comfort his son but just not in your bed.  End of discussion.

If he still complains, tell him counselling is on the table if he wants a happy home with you and the two new babies."
355,"Yes, yes, yes.

I am a child of divorce. My step mother NEVER got mother's day. She asked to split it with my mother and what she got was a resounding no from my little self and from my mother. 

My father would make me bring her a card the next time I saw her, and say happy mother's day.

OP, you aren't unreasonable for saying no. You are the mother. You are the one mothering this child. You are the one raising this child. She's been living with him for a year, that doesn't make her entitled to mother's day."
356,"My dad always says ""do I need to call you a wahhhmbulance?"" 

I'm 22, he still says it."
357,How sad it is that getting another adult involved seems to be the best advice
358,"Lot of stuff going on here.

He doesn't respect you enough to involve you, he's willing to ditch his kid and let you baby sit,

apparently he doesn't think that you being a housewife (I imagine because of his ""carrying the family"" comment that you;re a stay at home mom, correct me if I'm wrong) as if carrying for a house and a toddler isn't fucking work that plenty of people get paid good money to do.

If I were in your shoes, I would stop trying to convince him not to go and tell him that I've told him how I feel and give him the chance to decide that he respected me enough to not go.

If he decided he didn't respect me enough, after he left I would send him a text letting him know that I too am packing my bags and going away fro a while."
359,"This isn't about your kid. Talk to him about safe sex and then do it again in a month and maybe buy him a pack of condoms for good measure.

Then talk to your wife about why she's *freaking out* that her 14 year old son might have a girlfriend. This is not a reasonable reaction. She's blown it completely out of proportion for some reason and it's got nothing to do with your son or the girl. From the little I know about 'Big Law' it's a stressful environment. Your wife might be getting pressure-cooked at work and still scared that she moved the family to a new place for a job that... might not work out? That she might not like? That she's nervous she might not be able to actually do successfully?

I think this situation with your kid is just an outlet for something else. Something else is bothering her, because this response doesn't make sense. Find the root of the problem."
360,"I like breakfast in bed once in a while, but I think every day would be a little much. Some mornings I'm not hungry or I might want cereal or pancakes instead. Plus I'm often grumpy in the mornings and want to be left alone.

Personally I think it would feel more special if you just brought it to bed once in a while. 

I had an ex who would make me coffee every morning and leave it quietly beside the bed, maybe kiss my forehead. That was super sweet, but a full breakfast would have been overwhelming.

If you want to make her feel special and loved, ask her what would make her feel special and loved. Read about love languages together. Maybe she doesn't give two hoots about the breakfast but she would be over the moon to have a short cuddle or a sweet note every morning.

On the surface her comment sounds ungrateful, but she has a point - you're doing something she hasn't asked for and doesn't really care about, and expecting her to be happy because you're doing it. If the roles were reversed (not with breakfast but with something you don't care much about,) you'd probably have a hard time feeling really thankful too."
361,"Catboy generally works the drive-thru in the PJ masks tower, batman pulls up and my son says ""Happy meal service, what you want?"". I put on my best Christian Bale voice and order a happy meal with extra toys. After batman gets his cheeseburgers he goes and eats them in the bat cave."
362,"Stop doing joshs work. Stop paying for joshs stuff. Stop doing joshs schoolwork. Stop talking to josh. Dtop stop stop. That is most important thing.

As for prom, you could still go. Is there anyone from class you have done group work with who may bendown to hang with you? Any clubs you can still join?  Or go alone and tlak to people there but i know that isnt for most people, especially in high school.  You spent money on prom already so i would go still. 

Main thing from your post is that you need to cut josh out of your life. Stop doing everything for him. He doesnt care about you. Stop paying for his shit and letting him ride you through courses."
363,"&gt;That I wasn't a good example when my sister was little.

Excuse me, they were and are bad parents to condone  either of you to assault the other.  I wouldn't be keen to go on a trip with someone who attacked me and her enabler.  Your parents can't force you to go, you have to stand up for yourself sometime.  Maybe this is that time."
364,What about his relationship with your twin babies? Where will that fall in the priority list.
365,"I've actually asked him to do that about 5,000 times. I genuinely want to know if he thinks I did anything 7ish years ago that made her hate me. I've told him he won't hurt my feelings but he never has an answer. I think he genuinely has no idea why she dislikes me. If pressed, he will say one of the following:

1. ""I don't know why she is like this"" 
2. ""This is just who she is. She doesn't handle conflict well.""
3. ""She is just really stressed. No one eats her dinners and it hurts her feelings (this one is super paraphrased but basically he says that she acts the way she does because she is stressed about housework and money. I get being stressed about those things and feeling under appreciated, but I felt the same way when I was raising my sisters and I didn't treat them badly. They were kids.)"""
366,"I think it's important to have people you can trust and who support you in your life, don't make the mistake of throwing good friends away. 

  
A couple of things to note though, A: you will probably have more ""mommy friends"" once your child goes to pre-school/ school. B: You and your husband have a 6 year age gap, people in their early to mid-30s are more likely to have young kids than 26-year-olds. Some of your current friends may become future ""mommy friends."" I don't think that'll be an answer your SO will be happy though as I suspect he is just looking to get rid of your current friends."
367,"&gt;some moms have to work to support their families and do everything at home too so I should be grateful.

Those moms are called SINGLE. If you work too why would you expected to take care of everything at home? He lives there, he's part of the family and made that baby too. That line would piss me off.

I've been a working and now I'm a SAHM. When I was working it was a little harder to make him realize that he needed to help around the house. Getting free time was a challenge too because I have anxiety and don't like leaving the house much. It took a while but I got him to realize that I need a break too. 

Now that I am a SAHM there has been issues with him expecting me to do everything but I finally checked myself into the hospital and he was left alone with all 3 for a week. He is a whole lot better now. He finally realized how hard it really it. It's not like a job you can check out of, there is always something and even if you don't clean the house that day you still did all this other physical and mental work to take care of the kids.

Don't let him treat you like a single mom. Talking about it after he makes a decision is not acceptable. You need to be apart of the decision making process. I feel the same way about wanting my husband to go out and have fun, there has to be balance."
368,"You also can’t build a life with someone you can’t trust to follow their own mental health treatment. I know that sounds really harsh but this guy isn’t following through with taking his medication etc. Maybe that’s the cause of the problems but even if it is, it’s as much his responsibility to make sure his mental health issues are managed as it is to study. Even if he suddenly becomes financially capable, it seems like a deeper pattern of not taking responsibility for himself that I wouldn’t stick around for if I were OP."
369,"Playing hot wheels or ""Batman wants cheeseburgers"" until 11 then watching Pokemon until my 3 year old son falls asleep are definitely some of my favorite friday nights."
370,The last guy I was with who did that stuff eventually ramped up to raping me. Took a few years but I never said no and had it respected. This guy doesn't care about your boundaries or sexual comfort. He just wants to do what he wants to do.
371,"&gt; I ended up in the hospital on bed rest and having an emergency c-section 10 weeks early. I dont want that to happen to you.

You're so right. This is a much bigger issue than her feeling like she is putting herself before his kids."
372,"I think when you do something as... blunt as that, you open yourself to blunt questions.

Tell her what you told us - you were putting some stuff under the bed. You could probably even stop there. Or keep going and ask.

I figure she has some explanation. I can imagine a few. Or maybe it is the dog. Who knows.

If you're going to get married to a woman, you're going to have to get comfortable talking about uncomfortable things and you're going to have to get comfortable talking about women's health stuff. And seeing it - just... Not under the bed."
373,"&gt; There's a lot of times where I think it is appropriate and the right thing to do to obviously put your kids before yourself.

Sure. When there is only 1 serving of french fries left and you and the kid both want them? Give them to the kid. 

When you script and save to make sure they have decent clothes and shoes for school, maybe putting off hair cuts and new clothes for yourself? Yup. 

Sleeping on the fucking couch while pregnant with twins, WHEN YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ON **BED REST**, because an 8 year old child is being baby-ish? HELL FUCKING NO."
374,"&gt; but her roommate kept buying her drinks and got her drunk

Sorry, but your girlfriend CHOSE to drink those drinks. She's an adult. She could have politely refused to accept the next drink. She could have demanded her phone back. You're acting like she was in a hostage situation; she was at a bar and stayed out later than she intended.

Basically, your roommate can't force your girlfriend to do anything she doesn't want to do. If your girlfriend is unwilling to set boundaries, then your issue is with her, not her roommate.

&gt; Her girlfriend would purposely invite her to the bar with a few friends without telling her, and throw a fit if she wouldn't come with her

I'm not really understanding what this sentence is supposed to mean."
375,"If you want out and it's 100% reasonable for you to want this, then start planning now.

Set up a bank account at a different bank that you currently use.  Set it to sent electronic only statements etc. to a private email address.  Then start putting aside a few dollars here and there.  Save pennies and spare change and deposit it when you can.  Some women deposit money on gift cards and prepaid credit cards and the pay it into their account.

When you get closer to leaving, re-rout your mail to your grandmothers or get a post box.

You might also want to start checking out lawyers.  Most will have a free consultation.  Many also work on payment plan or with have options for payment.  As there are children involved, you'll want to have a clear understanding of all the issues.  You also want to be sure to get the support payments you deserve.  You've spend years out of your life taking care of his children and acting as his unpaid nanny, school teacher and maid.

Also look into what online courses or certificates you might be able to do.  Or online work.  A little extra money, a few qualifications or a certificate saying you know how to use Excel is better than nothing.

OP, get out.  This is slowly crushing you.  There is so much better you deserve."
376,"On this sub I see so, so many posts telling people to do exactly what your girlfriend does; ""if you want flowers, ask"" ""if you need physical affection, tell him"" ""if you want him to get you a certain gift, say so."" The idea is to communicate and to ask for what you need so your partner knows how to give it to you. There's nothing wrong with that! It's better than being disappointed all the time because your partner isn't a mind-reader. It may be that her past partners weren't as forthcoming with thoughtful gestures as you are so she's used to communicating explicitly about what she wants, it may be that your styles are just totally different. I'm gonna guess it's a combination, especially if you take her asking you for specific things as giving you orders; to me, those are very different things, and which it really is depends on the specific tone and phrasing.

I've also read some articles about how different people make and respond to requests, on an emotional level, that might be a helpful framework for you. They describe it as ""askers vs guessers."" This is from an Atlantic piece about it:

&gt;In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.  
In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer.

I would guess, based on your description of your girlfriend and yourself, that she's an Asker and you're a Guesser. For you, requests feel like pressure, and putting specific wants into words feels wrong. There's nothing wrong with that, exactly, but you run the risk of reading selfishness into other people who are just trying to be direct about what they need.

Anyways, if she's not actually ordering you around, you should be careful with how you approach this- if a guy told me he was fine with giving me things but not fine with me asking for them, I would feel pretty uncomfortable; it would seem like a weird control thing and I would feel uneasy about how he perceived our roles in the relationship. If she IS actually ordering you around (and I think you'll know the difference by how she responds if you can't do what she asks), then she probably is just selfish and you should act accordingly."
377,Why are you in a relationship with him still?  You're 19. Best thing for you is to break up. What you posted in far from normal and healthy. Your bf hasnt shown any remorse. Just leave or continue feeling bad because of him
378,"No this is between you and the father.  You two agreed to this and she needs to stay out of it.  You and the dad have the standing agreement about fathers day/mothers day, just stand firm like you are.  She's trying to make you out to be the bad guy and put your ex in the middle of it."
379,So he's running off for a week with someone he hasn't known since he was 19??
380,She's living in fantasy land and needs to understand that. This has nothing to do with your lack of support as a partner and everything to do with her burying her head in the sand about your joint finances. If necessary you could break your budget down line by line and show her why not working is not feasible. Given your situation it sounds like she's going to have to do what most people do when they want a new job - find a new one before quitting the current one.
381,"Actually, OP noted in a comment elsewhere that the kid ""suddenly"" developed a pain that needed an ice pack after seeing her with an ice pack on her stomach from a ligament pain. So it's very likely that he was copying her and faking it for attention/sympathy.

Which definitely isn't malicious from a child of that age, it's perfectly normal and attention-seeking when there will be new babies in the house, etc. is totally normal, but it's dad's job to recognize that this is what's going on and figure out how to deal with it in a way that doesn't put his child's need for attention over his wife's *literal health and well-being*.

But the dude (OP's husband that is) sounds like an emotionally abusive ass anyway, so I doubt he's too interested in doing his job in that area unfortunately."
382,"&gt;I can’t get my partner to listen to me, he doesn’t think there’s any point in me going to college. There’s no respect in the relationship and I don’t know what to do.

383,"Sex addiction can be real, many of the symptoms of withdrawal are in line with hard drugs.

Of course, the symptoms are self reported but they seem to be taken seriously by psychologists and medical professionals.

Having said that, if this were, say, a heroin addiction you would not be obligated to stay and deal with that.

He’s betrayed your trust.

The fact that he did this in a way that went beyond simply watching porn takes it to another level entirely and that’s to say nothing of him doing it while next to you on a romantic vacation.

Only you can decide what’s right for you. Only two people know what it’s like to be in your relationship and only one knows what it’s like to be you in your relationship.

The lying, the deceit, the betrayal, and the spending are all pretty terrible if you ask me.

If you were to be sympathetic towards his addiction that would be understandable but it would also be understandable if you were to decide it was an intolerable situation that he’ll have to deal with on his own.

Sometimes, you can help people but sometimes you jump in to save someone and you both end up drowning."
384,"He isn't a great parent, though he's considerably better than his. Other than the clear fat-shaming comments he doesn't understand the severity of the problem. He also thinks that since he turned out ""fine"" they will be, too."

387,"&gt;Do not be the bad guy to his mom. That is his job to do.

Good point. I'd imagine that she's more likely to take it from him than from me."
388,"That is exactly right. A normal person's reaction to ""I found a great dress!"" is ""OMG I want to see it! Try it on!""

My mom is just like yours. I strongly encourage you to get some therapy - it will help reduce your fear around her and reinforce how to draw healthy boundaries."
389,"For sure. My dad loved video games and taught me how to boot them up in DOS back in the day when I was like, 3. My mom basically had no idea how to use a computer. It was a special thing I grew to love with my dad. I had other things with my mom. 

OP, you can take your (eventual) kids camping without your partner. She can do other fun things with them without you. It sounds like that’s already not a problem for you guys... I’m not sure why it would change with marriage or kids."

393,"Let me tell you something as a woman who is more than ten years older than you....

There are SO MANY MEN out there who have had sex with a lot of women, and still suck at sex.  Because they are more concerned about what feels good to them then learning how to make the women they are with feel good.  Experiences DOES NOT equal mastery when it comes to sex.  If you are someone who wants to make your partner feel good, and aren't too proud to ask questions and take suggestions, you will be decent at sex.  

I guarantee there are women out there who are like ""He asked me what I liked, and then he DID THAT THING, and he didn't even get all upset when I suggested a slight adjustment.  Best.Sex.Ever.""  Yeah, the first few times may be awkward, because it just is when you learn any new skill.  But having sex isn't like learning to shoot a basketball or something. It's just as important to have a connection with your partner and truly want to please them, as it is to be practiced at the mechanics."
394,It's not that kids are having sex at 12. It's that you should be having these conversations with your kids before they hit puberty so they have an understanding what's going on with their body.

396,"I’d suggest;
Remind him that being unemployed especially with a payout is an opportunity to do things you can’t do when you need to attend an office. This time will end so don’t waste it on the couch. Understand he won’t want to spend money but there of lots of things that take time not money. 

Remind him that while age prejudice does exist experience is important (otherwise grads would
Run the world) so there is a large element of right place right time. Keep applying and interviewing. It’s a numbers game. 

Consider recruitment agencies. They work better than direct application sometimes. 

Probably most of all just remind him that to you he isn’t a cpa, he’s your dad and to you he isn’t defined by his employment status."
397,"Same thing here. My stepmother was horrible, and my dad knew it, and did nothing.

I have children of my own and would never let anyone treat them less than stellar, and after all the dust has settled, I blame my dad more than anyone. You can expect people to be horrible, but you should never expect that your own parent will refuse to protect you from being mistreated."
398,"Forget the paper clip. If it's a standard door knob with a lock, and there's no extra deadbolt or slide....grab a credit card or putty knife and wedge it right at the slot where the catch sits to slide it back and push the door open at the same time. Done."

For a whole year I wasn’t allowed to talk to them or see them. But every time I thought about them I thought about what they’d said and ultimately it gave me the confidence to stand up to his gaslighting and call him out as the abuser he was. Sometimes it’s just important for the abuse acknowledged by someone outside the relationship, it’s especially valuable in this scenario she’s been able to witness yours."
401,"When someone is trying to give you their condolences and love and support as family friend of the person who is ill — regardless of sexuality or race or simply anything you should separate your feelings about them. He is so disrespectful.

Don't kid yourself. The situation is already nuclear. You really do need to call a lawyer and get out ahead of this situation. Now. Don't wait until she starts making anonymous reports to CPS and you've got social workers involved, because that's the direction this could be headed. Don't wait until an actual emergency custody order is in place. Don't wait until your kids come home looking at you funny because she's been whispering in their ear that you don't really love them. 

I don't meant to scaremonger, but given where she has already gone, it really does sound like she has the potential to get much, much worse. Her behavior would scare me."
406,"Don't marry someone unless you really, really want to marry them, specifically. Not because it will make them happy, or make your family happy, or because you think it's time to get married, or because it's the 'next logical step', or because it would be easier than not getting married. And do you really, *really* want to marry your fiance?

Because what stands out to me about what you wrote here is that you don't seem to have any compelling reasons *to* marry this person. It seems more like you're looking for 'good enough' reasons not to marry him. ('I'm pretty confident I'm a lesbian' is a good reason not to marry a man, for what that's worth.)

You sound like you're trying to talk yourself into being okay with this marriage. There are, I'm sure, successful marriages that started with people convincing themselves that being married to their partner wouldn't be an unbearable amount of suffering. I'm also pretty sure that those marriages are a small minority compared to the ones where it turned out that it was actually unbearable. A marriage can be a long, long time.

Here's my advice: go find your people. There are LGBT+ support and social groups almost everywhere. Online communities can also be good. Go talk to other women who love women. Explore the question of who you are. And don't get married until and unless you actually *want* to get married, to whoever you end up wanting to be married to. Maybe that will be your fiance. Maybe it won't. But I think you'll be a lot happier if you can answer the question you're asking yourself about who you are and what you want before you get married to anyone."

410,"&gt; You're probably right (about finding the spark again) but it's very hard, he is an excellent person 90% of the time.

Abuse victims say the same thing about their abusers.

Most people can be good 90% of the time. That doesn’t matter one bit if they’re dangerous, selfish, disrespectful assholes the remaining 10%.

It’s like when Brock Turner’s dad called the sexual assault his son committed “just 20 minutes of action in an otherwise great life”. It doesn’t exonerate or excuse Brock’s horrific actions committed during those 20 minutes. And neither should you let your husband’s mostly excellent behavior excuse this repeated, dangerously selfish and moronic behavior, which crosses your very clearly stated personal boundaries."

It sounds like he has zero care for your health and wellbeing, which ought to be a base level relationship deal breaker. 

For the record I don't let my cat into our bedroom for no other reason than because my husband find it annoying, and I love him and want him to be happy in our home."

It sounds like this guy has never had to work for anything. How’s that gonna go when you guys need to start your adult lives? Is he going to have a career? Hell, even just a job? Do you want to own and maintain a home? Save for retirement? Because all of those things require planning and follow-through. Is this the wagon you want to hitch your star to?"

420,"Your husband is enabling his ""baby"" who is clearly feeling left out of the situation between you, your husband, and the twins on the way.

He's doing so at the expense of you.

That's not okay.

You need to talk to him. Make the bed off limits if need be. Make your whole room off limits if need be as most parents I knew growing up. These are things your husband should be able to understand and get behind, especially as his wife is pregnant with his new actual babies.

An 8 year old doesn't need to sleep in your bed. You do.

Once the twins come you're going to feel better physically but probably worse mentally and you're gonna need your space and your bed. Most especially if you are gonna be breasts the twins. Having an 8 year old forcing their way in at any time with the full support of the dad is not gonna fly. Set some boundaries sooner rather than later."

426,"So he's wrong, 100%, I just want to make that clear. 

That said, is it possible that he's actually in so much pain over losing his wife that he's trying to cram this lady into the giant void her death caused, as a way to avoid dealing with how heartbroken he is? 

He seems almost manic like ""I'm fine! This is great! I'm already in love again, see! Everything has gone back to normal!!"" Maybe the thought of experiencing his daughter's wedding without his wife by his side is terrifying and he can't deal with it?

Not that this means you two should invite her. Nope. When the wedding stuff is over your wife and her dad would probably benefit from a few sessions with a family/grief therapist. 

As for the wedding, can she have a true heart to heart with her dad and explain that she understands he will date again, and she'd like to have a good relationship with whomever that is, but introducing his new girlfriend at an event where his deceased wife's family will be both celebrating a marriage and grieving the fact that she isn't there to celebrate with them is incredibly selfish of him. I cannot even imagine how gut wrenching it would be for your wife to have to deal with that *at her wedding*. He needs a cold dose of reality, asap."
427,"Unlike everyone else in the thread, I'd advise against having this conversation over text. Text has a hard time conveying nuance and emotion, is extremely easily misinterpreted, and given that it's not in real-time and there might be delays could turn what's already a fraught and intimidating conversation into something that leaves you extremely anxious.

Having said that, I'm not oblivious to the truth that many men react violently and abusively towards trans folk they're dating (even though, from what you've described, this guy seems sweet and gentle).  The last thing anyone would want is for you to compromise your safety.

I think the best approach is a phone call. Yeah, yeah, I know... millennials don't talk on the phone etc. But it's a way to have an honest, complex, nuanced conversation while still remaining safe and secure.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems also that there are really two issues at play here: firstly that you're anxious about how he'll react to your being trans, and secondly about your romantic and sexual inexperience. I think it's possible to address both during the same conversation, in a way that reinforces to this guy that you're genuinely interested in him and willing to lay your cards on the table. I'd lead with something like:

""Hi \[guy\], I know we usually text, but I wanted to call you up and talk to you about something. You might have noticed I was a bit awkward and anxious when you kissed me the other night, but I just want you to know that it was great and I really like you. The truth is that I'm super inexperienced romantically, so wasn't sure how to make a move, but I'm really glad that you did.""

At this point, assuming he's a decent guy, he'll probably be reassuring and comforting towards you. How he responds  to you making yourself vulnerable in this way will give you a lot of information about him, and insight into how might react when you bring up your transness. If he has a high degree of sensitivity and emotional awareness he might even preempt you by asking if your anxiety was due to you being trans (or potentially, explain that *his* anxiety in the car was that he'd never kissed a trans person before). Either way, the discussion will hopefully prompt him to ask why you were anxious, or if there were any other factors at play. 

At this point you can say something along the lines of ""I'm not sure if you already know this, but I'm transgender and just wanted to be upfront with you"". I think you can be this quick and to the point, and I'd recommend not wringing your hands about it or being apologetic. In the words of Dan Savage, don't roll it out as though it's a cancer diagnosis. This is your life and your identity, and he's the one who's missing out if he decides to bail on you or react badly, so directness is your friend here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having said that, I think there are some factors to consider before having this conversation:

* is he generally informed about queer issues? Does he have friends who fall under the LGBTI umbrella, and does he move in those circles and spaces? 
* is he someone who has a vocabulary around trans identities? If you just say 'trans' will he know what you mean, or will you have to spell things out and educate him?
* How are his politics and approach to life generally? Is he typically someone who's accepting, nonjudgmental and open to life's rich tapestry? Or is he narrow-minded and xenophobic? 

These will help shape your approach and the language that you use. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck with this conversation! I know it might be intimidating, but it's also you speaking your truth, and regardless of the outcome at least you'll rid yourself of the anxiety over not knowing. I really hope it goes well, and that you'll give us an update afterwards. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I suppose this question is more geared towards cis men. How would you want a trans female to tell you this sort of news? What would make you most comfortable especially if you are not interested in dating a trans person and would be thrown off by a potential girlfriend telling you this? I just want to cover all bases.

Although I'm a cis guy, I'm also a sexual omnivore who's adventurous as fuck. I might not be the best person to answer these questions, but hopefully some thoughtful redditors who are your target demographic will stop by the thread."
428,"This whole thing could have been written by me. I've been in therapy for several years now about it and my therapist told me that I just needed to mourn my father, because he is no longer my father the way a father should be. That's what I've been doing and I don't even talk to my dad anymore and it's all because of my stepmother who treated me horribly as a child. 

I'm so sorry you are going through this, but I think you're right...it's not fixable in the way you want it to be. Same for me. At this point I just keep up the status quo so I can still see my siblings that live at home. It's sad but that's how it goes sometimes."
429,"Does your husband often give you the silent treatment or take things out on you when minor things go wrong? Do you end up making excuses for him to other people because his behavior is so over the top and embarrassing? Do you feel you have to walk on eggshells around him to keep him from exploding, but nothing ever seems good enough and he blows up anyway? These are serious symptoms of a toxic relationship. This sort of thing often escalates into more overt abuse. He could be depressed and need therapy or medication, or he could just be an asshole."
430,"I think most people would understand that at age 16 that you might not have been ready for a relationship, that at age 30 you can now handle.

I don't think you should feel any guilt for your past decisions. As a teenager, her coming into your life would have been much more difficult than it will be now as an adult.

As an adult you will probably also be much more capable of assessing the situation with her and whether she is stable enough to develop a relationship with.

If you'd like to reach out, I think you should and I believe she will understand."

432,"No, you should break up with her!!! So many problems here.

First off, the age gap. Anyone her age who is going after someone your age is red flag city. She's clearly very immature. 

Next, you *handcrafted this ring*. Even if it wasn't to her taste, she should be appreciative of the effort you went to. I think it sounds pretty, anyway. Her reaction to a gift is completely immature, petty, and inappropriate.

Third, you are 19--just because you can't reasonably afford diamonds (most 19 year olds can't!) does not mean you don't consider your girlfriend to be ""worth"" diamonds. She's so materialistic. And she's planning to SELL IT??? 

Ugh she's the absolute worst. Please leave her and don't date people who treat you like dirt in the future."
433,"Don’t buy her a diamond!! Don’t reward “bad behaviour”

Her reaction is irrational. Sit down and talk to her, if she’s calling you cheap and is ungrateful, keep the ring yourself and lose the gf. Even if she genuinely doesn’t like the ring, fine we all have different tastes, her reaction is what is concerning here"
434,"Thank you for taking the time to word this response. There’s a lot here I hadn’t considered. Weirdly enough, I’d always operated under this assumption that she was FINE when I was kicked out—I realize now it must’ve been hard for us both, and I can’t imagine the stress of suddenly being left alone with our mom. I’ll see if I can’t start a gentle dialogue soon."
435,"I will definitely ask about the rooms because yesterday I was in too much of a shock to really ask everything I wanted. 

Also about not mentioning her, he said that since she was in her 5 year relationship he and his family haven't heard about her and now that she's out of it she came back to then, that being the reason he didn't speak about her. And I do know for sure that his family does know this girl, as she was working with his aunt. 

But at the same time I feel weirded out by not hearing about her ever before and by him jumping in to go to holiday with her."
436,"It’s hard to be the sibling of someone with mental illness. I’m saying this as someone with mental illness. While my parents (or half of them because my dad is a d*ck) were worrying about me and trying to figure out what was wrong with me, my little sibling was pretty much ignored the entire time. From what I understand, they got good grades and were well behaved all so that they could please my parents/take some stress off of having to raise two kids with “problems”. To them, it felt like whenever I did a little better (and I effing struggled, there is no doubt about it) I got a trophy but when they performed well, they just got a “good job”. Resentment can really breed from that. I’m not saying it’s okay for your sister to behave this way, but this might be some insight into why. It might be worth something to recognize what your sister had to go through, too? Validation and recognition go a long way.

BUT at the end of the day, it’s not your job to “fix” everything. I hope your sister can go to therapy so that she can stop taking all that sh*t out on you and get some support. 

I know this probably won’t be the “popular” response to your problem but I felt like, as a fellow person with mental health problems and a sibling who used to resent me, this might resonate."
437,"She for sure is going to be renting your room. Move out! It might be hard, but your sanity will thank you."
438," Also there's some saying about a drunk man's words are a sober man's actual thoughts lol

You earned some good brownie points with your girl, proud of you for standing up to your friend. What an asshole."
439,"For almost every culture in the world, the responsibility of hospitality, entertainment, and food is in the host, not the guest.

This is not a cultural thing. OP’s in-laws are just being assholes. 

If his fiancé cannot see that, then they have bigger problems than this one trip."
440,"Same here. Dating almost five years. He was in a specific program at university and had to spend lots of time with his classmates. I was worried about one girl who openly flirted with him (even in front of me). Turns out he was actually fucking her roommate... who i hung out with more than once...who I helped on a project...  
After a weekend spent with his parents who had come up to visit us, he told me he didn’t love me anymore and dumped me. He immediately made his new relationship public. I moved back home, but my friend told me she saw them together multiple times starting the day after he dumped me.  
I got trickled truth-ed for a while until all the pieces came together that they’d been together for the last 10-ish months of our relationship.  
Not sure if they’re still together, but the bitter part of me hopes he cheats on her, too."
441,"&gt;He says he makes an effort to wear jeans rather than jogging pants when I am around.

That's not making an effort."
442,"Every custody agreement I've seen - and I'm at the age where most of my friend's are divorced, it's a 40's-50's thing I guess? - mother's day and father's day are treated completely different than the standards days - they are set aside for the mother or father, no matter if it's the other's parenting time or not. 

She's making a power play. If your ex doesn't step in, it's sign that he is going to let her keep this up."
443,"I am sure you mean well, but it sounds like you're treating her more like a child than an equal partner. She is an adult; she is capable of making her own meals and getting up on time to go to work. (And if she isn't, is that really the sort of person you want to spend your life with?)"
444,"Try ""Either you get help or I file for divorce. Your choice. I can't live like this anymore."" Be prepared to follow through though."
445,"&gt;I really don’t, I’m shocked at this behavior.

You're six months into your relationship. This is usually around the time that the 'honeymoon period' starts to wear off, and people become more comfortable to let their guard down and show their partner their true self, rather than the sanitised, polished, homogenised version that they do when they're just dating.

And tonight you learned what this guy's truly like - he's a cat-kicker. Is that someone you want to be with?"
446,"Omg no. I has this same thing happen to me when I was dating my ex husband. He planned and paid for a trip to Las Vegas for him and his ""sisterly friend"" and didnt tell me (we were also long distance at the time). When he finally told me about it, it was 1 week from their trip. I, like you, was totally shocked by this and told him I needed to think about it. Back then, I wanted to be the ""cool girlfriend"" and not be jealous by someone who was supposedly just a friend. 

I agreed to let him go, then I asked about the room situation. He said that to save money, they were sharing a 1 bedroom hotel together. I about lost my shit. He then follows up with, ""well I was going to sleep on the couch and let her have the bed"". LOL. So, after that, I told him I was absolutely uncomfortable with it, but he still wanted to go. His friend is actually the one who ended up cancelling, since I wasnt comfortable. He was pissed and ended up breaking up with me about a month later....we got back together and got married. 

Even after marriage, this girl was still an issue. He would flirt with her and want her to go visit him while we were still long distance. It was clean she wasnt ""just a sisterly friend"" as he assured me he was.

We ended up getting divorced, and before our divorce was finalized, they were dating.

To summarize this, DO NOT let your boyfriend make it seem like it's okay if you feel like it's not. Do not feel like you have to let him go on this trip. Yes it's his money that he's spending, but if he had respect for you, he'd be taking you and not some other woman, regardless of how close of ""friends"" they are.  Your feelings are valid, do not let him make you feel like they're not or make you feel like you're crazy and controlling for not wanting him to go on this trip. 

His reaction to you confronting him about this will be telling. Try to stay calm while talking to him and keep a clear head to properly evaluate the situation in the moment. Good luck &lt;3"
447,I don’t even know if this is sarcasm
448,"I had a similar situation with my boyfriend. Like you, we split all bills 50/50 but I did all the cleaning and cooking. Was pretty sick of it, so I used our joint account to pay for a cleaner. He went nuts, but I just explained if he wasn’t willing to help physically, he would help financially. 

May not be appropriate or practical in your situation, but I wasn’t putting up with it anymore. The cost is worth the peace of mind. Not really a victory, but at least he contributes in some way now."
449,"I made another comment,  but he needs to see his doctor. Loss of bowel control,  not being able to take his own blood sugar/inject himself/administer his own meds, deal with his own catheter,  ambulance on his own (even if he needs a walker isn't normal) . Most people, kidney transplant postop, do not need that level of care. They need some help with housework, cooking, and changing their dressing,  not what your father needs.

I used to do home health nursing, the nurse's job is pretty much just to check his progress/incision sites, perhaps some aROM exercises.  Unless, something else is wrong, it is doubtful his insurance would authorize nursing care just to take blood sugar/give insulin/administer meds/help toilet - unfortunately,  this is the patient's/patient's family's responsibility.  If he has issues other than a routine recovery, CNA care may be authorized. 

Contact the hospital social worker and his nephrologist and tell them your concerns. As you say he cannot afford an aid, out of pocket, this is your first step to have him re-evaluated."
450,"I think it's definitely too much to ask someone you've been dating less than a year.  Seems pretty heartless to me actually, and especially from someone that has pets of their own.  There are also a ton more options to go through first than ""get rid of the dog""; that should be the final option.  

I would see how this plays out when you talk in person.  If he apologizes and is willing to try other things first, then I would let it of.  If he doubles down on getting rid of the dog and won't try other training things first, then I would break up."
451,You can’t believe that they are young they will wait. I know two people who got pregnant at 12/13 TEACH SAFE SEX !!!
452,It seems like less of a dog issue and more of an issue with your girlfriend. Have you told her you want the house cleaner and you dont mind the dogs if the it is kept clean?
453,"Oh fuck that. 

She's about to get married. For probably at least half the time since she lost her mom she's been planning a wedding. Generally a thing the bride's mom helps out with quite a bit. 

I bet every step of wedding planning, especially dress shopping, made it all fresh again. 

No matter how long ago the death happened, there are certain milestones that will make it freshly painful. A wedding, a holiday, a grandchild being born. Grief can't be measured as a linear decrease in pain. That's just not how it works."
454,"That’s a really long time away from responsibilities with a young child, that aren’t for work.  He is full of shit that he doesn’t see why it’s a big deal."
455,"My mom would say ""act your age, not your shoe size."""
456,"She needs to be in counseling and you need to think about ending this until she gets her shit together. You can't make her trust you because she wouldn't trust ANY man. This has nothing to do with you, this is all her."
457,And OP don’t you dare buy that it Oman a ring. Do NOT reward this behaviour. You’ll just get more of it.
458,"&gt;So Baby is Born for abouth 30 minutes and bf asks me: can I go to work and the feed the stock (he is a farmer). Me - thinking he will hurry and I know the stock has to be fed nomatterwhat - replies : yes. Him: Can Friends still stay overnight? Me : yes

He should not have even been asking you about the friends! By putting the ""Can friends stay?"" decision on you, he was making you do emotional labor right after you'd gotten done with the childbirth kind of labor. He should have just handled that shit on his own -- and any ""friends"" worth their salt would understand that a sudden intense labor trumps whatever get-together they might've wanted that weekend.

By making you the ""decider,"" in his mind, he shifted all the responsibility for the situation to you. That mental trick lets him do whatever he wants and then say well, you didn't tell me not to. He basically still has the mindset of a child, wanting to be told what to do, and trying to squirm out of it if he doesn't like what he's told. The fact that he's still saying ""well I'm sorry BUT"" and laying on the excuses tells you that his mindset has not changed, and if the mother of his two kids feeling betrayed at her most physically vulnerable time of life isn't enough to shake him out of that, do you really think anything else will? 

You might give couples therapy a shot, but that will only work in so far as your boyfriend is willing to adult up and take responsibility."
459,"I think it's worth pointing out that there's another layer here. Her tortoise didn't die, he was given away. It wasn't a twist-of-fate kind of situation, it's a direct result of decisions made by her family. She probably feels that her needs were ignored, and even if her family did the right thing, that's still deeply hurtful. She's not only grieving her pet, she's probably upset with OP and her other family members for creating the situation that hurt her.

I don't mean to say OP and her family didn't do the right thing- it sounds like they did- but feeling like you have no agency really stings at 14. You're old enough to notice it and old enough to feel ""adult"", so it feels awful when people disregard you like you're a child and act like your feelings don't matter. OP, this is probably why she's lashing out at you when you're attempting to make her get over it- you're reinforcing to her that nobody cares about how she feels."
460,"&gt;The only thing I have “better” than him was that I’m an attractive female and he’s average looking 

This sentence really highlights how your view of a relationship is skewed and unhealthy.

When you're with someone, it isn't about having the upper-hand on things. Relationships aren't built off a checklist. They are built of shared values, beliefs, compatibility and chemistry."
461,Yikes I missed that. You’re right. Moved in with kids at least part of the time after three months??
462,"It was only 4 months, that's not very long.  He told you he didn't want kids and didn't want to meet your son so not sure how much more clear he could have been about his views on children.  If anything it seems like you didn't listen to what he was telling you."
463,"He's intentionally causing you physical pain and trauma and doesn't care what your boundaries are, get out because he's starting to escalate it into more scary shit."
464,Thank you. It made me really angry too.
465,"&gt; Text her and tell her you found a great dress, but you'd love to *go shopping for a mother of the bride dress* with her when she visits.

OOOH! This is a great idea!"
466,"He's an adult. He could have said ""No, I want to work on my marriage.""

He chose not to. I'll bet his marriage was just fine."
467,"This is a pretty great way to put it, imo. Maybe add something to let him know, ""I know some people may consider this a deal breaker and that is understandable. I didn't want to go any further without being honest with you about it"" at some point in there.

Also I'd like to double-down on doing it over text/some kind of private message like that. Not only is it for your own safety (which is the number one reason), but also to give him time to think about it or process it if he needs. If you do it in person, he may either react strongly in a bad way or he may just feel pressured to make a decision about it right away. I imagine if he'd never had a reason to consider whether he'd be interested in dating a trans person, it would probably be something he'd want to think about a bit rather than making a split-second decision."
468,"Man, the day your wife went behind your back and dropped a bomb on a relationship you have had for half your life was unbelievably disrespectful to you. Big red flag. 

Other posters have said this as well, but usually when a person lashes out this hard on their parter for cheating it means that they are actually cheating. Maybe not physically but emotionally for sure. Locker herself in the bathroom for hours talking to someone. Who is it? Being protective of her phone while invading your privacy. Ask to go through her phone? I bet she freaks out."
469,I think this is the crux of the matter. He judges you for one thing and then he judges you for the opposite thing. He doesn’t sound like he is a person to be with in the long term. He sounds like he has no problem putting you down. Asking you not to wear certain things is a red flag. There will be more things in the future he will want you to change about yourself.
470,"&gt;I just want my dad to still like me.

&gt;I think they are being a little much on this one. 

Wow, they are really doing a number on you.   You absolutely should move out to exactly the area that you want to live.   Honestly, just go do it.  I promise you they will get over it and you will not lose your relationship with your parents."
471,"Look, you really need to cut your mum out of your life. However, the only thing that actually makes sense is for everyone to sit down and write down concretely how this adoption is going to work out, who's going to tell the kid and when etc. Every legal aspect should be discussed with a lawyer

&gt;  Whether the kid ever finds out I'm the birth mom is completely up to my bro and SIL. I want no part of that decision. I don't want to be this kid's parent.

Look, your mum is going to cause trouble if you and your brother don't set healthy boundaries. Hence, having a talk about how to tell the kid will be essential. And be prepared to talk to them why you made this decision."
472,AND he's only looked after the kids for her to do something with a friend once... for two hours...
473,Looking for work/ trying to restore vintage computers to re-sell. He's been looking for work since January 2019.
474,"Yeah, I've had enough good information from parenting books and the internet that I think I'm making it work.

Plus, it's easy enough to find other kids to play with by just going to a playground and introducing yourself to other parents and introducing the kids"
475,"So he’s damned if he goes and you’ve decided he’s doing it for the “wrong reasons” if he doesn’t go. You’ve said on a few different parts of your post that you trust him, so I’m not sure where your discomfort lies."
476,"Thank you, I'm thinking the same. I brought this up to her last night and she pulled the same guilt trip of how o never care and how I'm giving up on her."
477,"Yeah. This isn't a breakup worthy prank...I was expecting a story like

""I got a call from someone saying they were a doctor and they had my test results; it's serious and I need to come in right away,"" or something, only for the boyfriend to confess his prank when she called him panicking. 

I think his prank was a bit insensitive, but he owned up right away and apologized. As long as he is actually sorry and he understands why it upset you, this is forgivable."
478,"I'm so sorry that happened to you. What a horrible situation.

I'm going to suggest a non-traditional solution. Do you like animals? I feel like you were at your happiest when you were caretaking people and had a busy house filled with life. Perhaps consider adopting a couple of dogs or cats. Maybe even a special-needs animal that requires a lot of love and attention.

Only do this if you feel you can overcome your depression and financial situation to adequately care for the animals, obviously. 

But I know when I'm my lowest, my animals get me moving again. Their love soothes me, their needs force me to get off my ass. Their play in the house and companionship is comforting."
479,"The fact that he lied to you about it is reason enough to be upset, even if it was a lie by omission and his mom did come and visit. He even projected and led you on bringing up seeing other people but didn't tell you he was actively sleeping with others. I would probably just move on at this point as it will be hard to come back from him breaking your trust and you breaking his by snooping. Tell him you saw the photos and apologize and just end things there."
480,"yes! why should everyone just give in and accept Frank and his smell?! if he is choosing to smell, then he has to deal with the fact that not everyone wants to deal with him and his stank!"
481,"""We are totally fine except he rapes me anally and chokes me during sex.""

Escalation. No respect for boundaries. Lying. False promises."
482,"FUCK! I thought it was only happening with me, turns out, nope! There are more people like me going through the same shit. 

  
I'm going to hang around here for advice, I do not have much to say but only big hugs and lots of good wishes."
483,There have been no previous issues with his mother but ever since we got the baby she has been like this. I get that she's excited to be a grandmother but she's being disrespectful.
484,"As someone who used to have an issue regarding body odour (my issue was caused by a mix of living in a house that was rotting and full of damp and also depression from living in such a situation causing me to give up on myself) , you need to lay down the law with both your partner and Frank.
If he wants to see Frank then he can go visit him or go somewhere public. If Frank wants to come round then he needs to shower at most an hour before he leaves the house and make sure his clothes are clean. 

My friends laid down the law for me and it helped me massively. Joking about it pushed me further into my hole but telling me straight helped sort myself out.  

If he comes round and he smells then tell him to go in the shower, and if he does it again then he has to leave."
485,"To his credit, he only pretended for a few seconds before revealing his identity.  I don't think this is enough to ruin the relationship, but you need to be firm with him and tell him how you do not like these pranks and you will not stand for them ever again."
486,"Even if you ignore the stealing, you're left with a woman who has never been responsible, whom you have invited into your home indefinitely until such time that she suddenly, spontaneously, decides to turn into a responsible person and start doing all the unpleasant things that adults have to do, i.e. get a job, pay rent, etc.

This was *never going to happen.* She has *absolutely no incentive* to do those things when you are willing to allow her to stay in your house watching TV instead. She will literally stay there forever.

Even telling her that she has to get a job and move out is not going to have any impact if your partner is not actually willing to give her any consequences. There are two paths here: one where your partner is willing to force her out of your home, even when she doesn't have another home lined up, because of her choices and her actions; and one where she leeches off you forever. (Or there's a third path, where she leeches off your partner while you nope your way out of this.)

People like this do not ""get on their feet"" as long as they have people like your partner who will carry them."
487,"I would not let him know that you know he's lying about everything.  No idea how he would react, because he's contstructed quite the story about him and his background.  Get through these 2 months, and don't live with him again.  In fact once you are no longer living together I would completely ghost him.  No explanation needed."
488,"All the comments are talking about how she should do what she wants with her body if it makes her happy .. 

Am I the only one noticing that OP’s girlfriend seems to think she was cheated on *because* she had small boobs? It almost sounds like she’s gotten this boob job to *prevent* being cheated on. 

This is just coming from a fellow B cup, Bee Sting girl. Having small breasts really takes more of a toll on a girl’s esteem and well being than any guy/bustier girl might realise. I’ve definitely actually avoided relationships and sex altogether due to them. 

So I’m more worried about the idea that she’s gotten her boobs done ‘for her’. She might totally lose self confidence and sanity if she finds out that her boyfriend actually prefers her *without* something she’s constantly been told by media, society and her exes that she’s been *lacking*."
489,"Everyone is embarrassed by the talk. It isn't pleasant, but it's necessary. And honestly I wouldnt even connect it to him hanging out with Kelsey, because that's irrelevant. Give him some condoms, talk to him about consent, how things work, how it's ok to not want to have sex or to be really curious about it, birth control,etc. And please don't assume he's straight, mention it's ok if he's not. even if you don't think he is, it'll mean the world if he's ever even thought about what would happen if he was. Then ask if there's anything he has questions about or is scared of and to come to you if he thinks of anything or wants to talk about dating anyone, etc. I'd also refer him to Scarlett Teen because he might prefer to look things up online than ask you and you want him to look at a reputable source, not some skeezy website. 

Good on you for having your son's back and not letting your wife's anxiety control him. I'd also talk to her about how she feels about your son growing up and being a teenager. I'm sure moving and seeing him grow older has brought up a lot of things for her."
490,"What did you do to support that was so vital and critical it supplanted your need for a career????? Seems like your whole identity is your girlfriend and hers isn’t you. I doubt convincing her to need you as much as you need her is the direction she’s looking for. Be interesting, have your own life and ambitions - be someone someone else would want, not just need or like having around"
491,"So the poor kid has to move across the country, deal with all this crap, and now get cockblocked by his own mother?

Get ready for kids that never call when they’re grown."
492,"If you stay with him, you know he wont be faithful to you. And will put your health at risk with risky secretive encounters. You know what to do here."
493,"Rock on! That’s awesome!!!!!! 

Believe in yourself! You were dealt a shit hand in life, but you can rise up and have a great life.  You’re worth it."
494,"Did she ask you to do those things for her, or did you decide to do them every day after she made a one-off complaint about not having enough time in the morning? 

It sounds like acts of service is how you show your love, but acts of service might not be the thing that makes *her* feel loved. You guys might want to go over the 5 Love Languages and see what you can do to get on the same page about what each of you wants and needs to be satisfied."
495,"I think this is a red herring. How is your wife coping? Is she overly stressed about other stuff? How are her moods?

I ask because focusing on one thing like this and the overreaction kind of read like a depression/anxiety response and maybe your wife needs some different help. Moving and change plus a new job? Those are all triggers. I know because I'm depressive too.

I agree that nothing your son's doing seems weird, even if they are dating. For your son, don't get sucked into your wife's obsession here. Be a calm and steady adult he can talk to."
496,"OP I am confused by your timeline you’ve posted in the comments.

It seems that 

- You made a mutual plan to stay until end of July 
- She acted on that plan under the impression you were on board as you had previously agreed 
- You then told her you had changed your mind and wanted to leave in June 
- She is now annoyed because she feels you broke that original agreement 

If this is the case it really depends on how firm the agreement to stay through to July was. 

If it was a serious discussion to do so and that was agreed, and lease extension was agreed to be necessary in order to action that, then I don’t see why she would need to check with you again re the extension. In that case I think you are in the wrong because your friend took on a significant financial obligation on the basis of an agreed plan with you, and therefore you should pay your share of that obligation (even though you gave her notice if your leaving, she won’t be able to sublet for one month). 

If there was never an actual agreement between you to stay to July, for eg just a casual / very quick convo and no settled decision, then she of her own accord decided to act on that by getting an extension without consulting you, then I think she’s taken on that financial obligation by herself and you don’t need to pay. 

So I think you need to be really honest with yourself about what is the fairest representation of the situation and decide accordingly. 

I would also consider just paying to preserve the friendship though if that’s something you want."
497,"this. my stepdad went batshit insane on me when I got my first bf and all it did was cause more problems. if he would have had a different approach, I would have been in much safer and more informed conditions"
498,That's shocking to me. Their kids is 2.5 years old and he's only been solely responsible for her *once*? And only for *two hours*?! But he's the one carrying the family. Sure buddy.
499,I would also suggest you tell your uncle Jesus is compassionate and kind and your uncle is cruel and a Pharisee.
500,Kind of sounds like he might fire you. Whatever you do don't quit. Apply for unemployment if he fires you and definitely keep sending your resume out.
501,"He's selfish.

True, maybe this health scare is affecting his train of thought, but it would be more likely he would want to go and do things with you, kind of ""life is short"" mindframe.

Once he mentioned saving it for him, uh uh.

Especially since he's looking for a job only in his field of study.

I think this has shown his true self.

He selfish."
502,"No, he’s an adult. He went there with the hot people comment.


That’s a straight odd comment to say, and he went right to commenting on other women’s bodies.

All this hand waving is bullshit. It’s a weird comment specifically targeting her looks in reference to other women, about a hobby she’s feeling neglected about."
503,"Change your locks.  To something they can't get a key for.  Go about your business.    
You can choose to sue them or pursue legal action but I doubt you'll get far.  It's probably going to cause everyone tremendous heartache and accomplish nothing.

Unless your country has a law against homosexuality, or they can put you in jail for adultery, or you are in fear of being stoned if others find out, just ignore them.   Any energy you invest in the parents is energy you don't have for yourselves and your own relationships."
504,"Your sister sounds like a leech to be honest. I would rip her out of my life very quickly. Try and get a separate living arrangements like a dorm if you can. Start grey rocking her, and don't tell her your plans. Be that for the evening, or your life. If she asks if your going to an event

""Oh, I don't know! I have so much to do!""

See if she goes on her own or sticks around. If you make plans, don't share them with her."
505,"This gets into a bit of counseling techniques, but...

I think you need to consider that attempting to make her feelings go away, 'making her feel better' is basically about *not* letting her feel bad, is actually being inconsiderate of those emotions. You're not giving her space and time to process them or talk to you about them. She doesn't get to be sad with you about it or experience the loss. You're trying to explain reasons she shouldn't feel that way at all. In a sense, you're explaining why her feelings are wrong and she shouldn't feel them.

Which makes a kind of sense, because you want her to be happy and not sad, but is actually kinda bad. Because people feel bad about things all the time. That's not a bad emotion to feel. Sadness isn't supposed to go away in an hour or day or week. It can just be ok to be sad sometimes.

You can help by being sad with her. Accepting the emotion and understanding it. Pull out all the pictures you can find of this guy and make a collage of them or something. Dwell in it a bit. You're not throwing yourselves a pity party. You're processing a loss. Your family had this pet for decades! Let yourself be sad about having to give him away.

And maybe go watch Inside Out."
506,"It won’t be easy, because you’re pretty much addicted to him and the hopes of attention from him. Whenever one of my toxic relationships would end I’d go into a legit withdrawal feeling where i would be obsessed and put myself through horrible, painful, ridiculous situations. 

Humiliating myself to try to show them I love them sooooo much so can’t they just get with it? Crying and begging at the front door? Check. Showing up to the job? Check. Spamming phone calls and texts? Check.

Don’t do this. Fight it with everything you have. If you have the means to leave the physical area for a while, do it. Ask for help. Tell your family. Tell your friends. Find other things to do. Don’t sit and wait with bated breath for this dude to feel out his feelings for the week. Go silent. Ghost him. 

If he suddenly wants in, it’s because you fluff his ego with all of this begging and pleading and he wants more of THAT but not you, not the actual you. Cut him off at the knees and suddenly you take back the power of your own life. Choose you. You’re wonderful. You’re a good partner. You deserve someone who wants you so much. YOURE the catch. Why are you worried over this idiot who treats you so wishywashy? Release yourself and release him. It doesn’t need to be any harder than you make it. Change your mental narrative starting now."
507,"If she’s truly manic she isn’t in her “right” mind and is not going to be able to listen to you and be rational. Psychiatry is basically a “must” with bipolar disorder. It’s ok to tell her she gets into treatment and sticks with it or you can not trust her. She has done nothing to “fix” herself, she is likely going to cheat on you too."
508,"Regardless of your pregnancy or bed rest prescription, It’s your bed too. If your husband thinks his son needs to sleep with him, he can make arrangements to do that elsewhere; you should t give up your bed if you don’t want to or physically need not to."

This was my thought. Party girl needs funds."
510,OP read this comment from Stephiej17.  Reflect. Do not repeat this nightmare cycle. Deep down you already know who he is and what you guys are. No amount of money will ever change that. Stop making excuses for him!
511,Yeah. I think the comments are being too hard on Op and calling him greedy. If my father’s new wife suddenly announced something like this while my father sat quietly I would want answers too. I find it a very human response.
512,"Block her on everything. Her threats are not serious. And even if they are, you can handle your parents better than her blackmail. She is a predator. You could easily go to the police. I dont know the exact laws in germany but I imagine there is a lot of protection for someone your age. You need to block that pieve of shit on everything and dont worry about what she does. She is a sicko preying on teens. Please block her everywhere and do not message her again"

517,"This post should be saying ex-GF. Please break up with her. She lied so much.

Do not work things out. You'll be hurt again. She kept texting him and wouldn't tell you the truth if you hadn't noticed something unusual. This is not how a loving relationship works.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;She only lied about him.

For now...

&gt;  I really do believe her and that she regrets it and she knows she made a huge mistake 

Yes, because you saw her hiding her phone. Next time she might do a better job at hiding it.

&amp;#x200B;

You're not too deep in and it's already hell. You met her in November and she cheated on you in the first few months.

You'll find someone who will surprise and treat you even better than her and will also be faithful and respect you. Nobody deserves the treatment you got from this relationship. Cut all contact and don't let her manipulate you with ""but I really miss you"" messages.

Good luck!"
518,Drop off lil gifts to her once in a while 🙂 even cute stickers would make her day
519,"Of course you shouldn't get over this and ""be happy"" that your partner and the father of your child is abandoning you for two weeks without even consulting you on it! In 2.5 years, you say he has given you a break ONCE, for only two hours, but he gets to just stop being a dad for two weeks? HELL NO. He's extremely selfish and immature. You are supposed to be a FAMILY now, but apparently in his mind it's all about him and what he wants.

Two main points:

* Neither partner can just take off for two weeks without discussing childcare arrangements and loss of income with the other one. If he's taking two weeks unpaid leave for this, that needs to be a discussion TOGETHER, not a unilateral decision he makes.
* If he gets a vacation from the family, so do you. Tell him you two need to look at the calendar and decide when you get to go on your two week vacation without the baby. I bet he'll freak out and claim it's not the same, because he's a selfish jerk."
520,"It's actually kind of heartbreaking that you think asking your husband to stay by your side during the birth of your child is somehow ""silly."""
521,"There's a lot of times where I think it is appropriate and the right thing to do to obviously put your kids before yourself.

But this situation just feels wrong to me, especially how my husband reacted to it. 

Bill has always been the youngest, and the most spoiled of the 3 kids. His 2 older sisters and parents have always spoiled him. Qhen we told him I was pregnant he BAWLED his eyes out. (He turns 9 next month). And I knew there was some emotion to it but when we asked why he said he didnt think he would get all the things he wants anymore.

I've always been a little leery with the parenting of his kids, especially Bill since he is always 'the baby' of the family.

He has an 18 yr old daughter and a 15 yr old daughter who both have boundaries (18 doesnt live with us). And recognize how hard being pregnant has been on me. So his other 2 are very well adjusted to boundaries, it's just Bill."
522,"“If you’re going to be lame, I’m going to go back to my parents’ house, where I live at age 24, and hang out with my dad.” 

No, you’re not wrong in thinking you’d be better off with someone that hasan interest in improving themselves. You’d probably also be better off with someone who understands what “lame” means."
523,"I used to work with a lot of French and Belgian guys and besides the good natured shit talk of France/Belgium being the better than America because &lt;insert reason&gt; I never had a single experience like this.  When they’d host they’d pay. They were always welcoming. Honestly they were no different than anyone from any culture as far as hospitality is concerned. I feel like being a good host and fussing over guests is almost a universal human trait. I hope you can bring your wife back down to earth and get her on your side. I’d definitely stop paying for shit at least. People can talk shit all they want to me, but I’m not paying them to talk shit to me. Good luck OP"
524,"I'm so sorry, dude. I hope you get some answers as to why she did this, and I hope that you get to tell your friend that he was right."
525,"&gt;I was like ""wtf what about your wife"" and he told me his marriage was on the rocks, they were only together for the kids, they were basically like roommates who got on each other's nerves...I told him that despite all that, I wasn't getting involved with someone married. 

Congratulations on being like, the first person on this sub who hasn't fallen for that line. So many people post here asking for help with their older, married SOs and they all bought the ""loveless marriage"" story hook, line, and sinker. So seriously, good on you for calling his bluff and refusing to get with him until he actually left his ""miserable"" relationship. 

Now, onto your situation; you don't owe him anything. You didn't end his marriage, he did. He decided that dating you was worth blowing up his family. But dating is essentially marriage tryouts...you're testing to see if you're compatible long term. But you've realized you aren't. So tryout over.

He was ready to cheat on his wife with you. The only reason he didn't is because you wouldn't do anything with him while he was  married. Deep down, you know he'll end up doing the same thing to you. 

It doesn't matter what he's sacrificed. He did all that by choice, and if it ends up biting him in the ass, that is a lesson he has to learn. Next time he might not be so willing to blow up his life."
526,"I would focus on a positive request not a negative one. You want to make sure you get time as a family and a couple. When exactly do you get quality time with your wife? When are your nights with your wife, where you are actually having focused couple time and not just being exhausted?

I think you're both right. I think this is meant entirely platonically *and* is a dangerous situation. Awareness is key here. Google ""relationship walls and windows."" You both need to be opening windows of connection between the two of you and building walls of space around your relationship."
527,"Yeah, he might have to radically reconsider his options. Fortunately, he's got a professional license so that should help a lot.

Contract/temp work, starting a tax prep or consultancy, or looking for a startup who need to develop all of their procedures could all be on the table. The typical corporate gig isn't probably going to work.

He's probably going to need to network pretty hard, so I really like the idea of volunteering."
528,Exactly. I was 14 and my brother was 13 when my dad gave us the talk together while on a boys road trip. Awkward as fuck but I’m 24 with a girlfriend of 6 years and we haven’t even had a single pregnancy scare. Talks about safe sex are the best prevention
529,"I wouldn't bother responding. 

I'm a mother so I can sympathise with her decision to drop out of being a bridesmaid - although I do think she left it very late to tell you - because you can't always know how having a small baby is going to affect you. 

However, once she had committed to come to the reception it was rude of her not to inform you that she wasn't going to make it. Emergencies happen, but that doesn't appear to be what was going on in your case. 

She should have written to you and apologised for not turning up. Her parting comments to you are very rude. 

It's not worth your time to respond."
530,Just tell them it’s because they aren’t good people. Better than dodging the question
531,"&gt; But why have a meltdown over it? 14 year olds date. Some even have sex. I mean it wouldn't be unheard of, especially in a year or 2 it'd be expected.

Some moms (or parents really, I've seen dads get weird with their eldest daughters, or weirdly controlling over their eldest sons) can get emotional over their kids growing up and becoming more independent--especially with firstborns. Sure it's a little dramatic but it's pretty natural and I guess (as a guy) a little understandable."
532,"&gt;And it has pockets!!!

&amp;#x200B;

This line. I never knew women would ever be excited about pockets in a dress until I saw my wife. We were out one day, she's wearing a beautiful dress. I don't remember exactly how it happened but she realized it had pockets. Her reaction to it, it was like a kid on Christmas morning who just opened the gift they wanted most of all. I will never forget that reaction."
533,"I'm a cis girl, I know you're looking for cis men to respond but something stuck out to me. You say that you're not always cis passing to some people, so I'm just wondering is it possible he already knows but just hasn't said anything? Do you have any friends in common that may have already told him? In regards to actually telling him you can text him if you want, but if you want to do it in person please make sure you're in a public place! I'm sure he's a nice guy but you can't be too careful as a trans woman.

I really hope it works out for you!"
534,"Same here. My Dads wife hated me. Apparently because I looked like my mum. Even tho she’d never met her. Ended up with me just stopping seeing my dad. The last time I spoke to him was when I got engaged and he told me he wouldn’t come to my wedding because it would be awkward with my mum there. I never contacted him again. He died about 2 years ago and I hadn’t seen him for about 20 years. He never met his granddaughter  
I lived with my mum and step dad. He also hated me &amp; my bro. Nasty, mentally and physically abusive. Kicked me out a number of times. 
Both my parents wouldn’t stand up to them. When I had my daughter, who’s 14 now, I understood it less. There is no one on this planet that I would put ahead of my daughter.   I’m a single mum now, but any relationship I’ve had in last few years I’ve made it clear that this is also my daughters house so I’m not keen on someone moving in or giving her a step father. I make it completely clear to her that she is safe and has a home with me forever. 
My whole upbringing has left me with distrust of people and a default setting that people don’t like me. I still can’t shake that and I’m in my 40s now. 
How I feel about my daughter... I just can’t understand how both my parents let my step parents treat me like that.  I would never ever let my daughter feel like I did"
535,"I’m an ex sex worker and I’d be uncomfortable with this because take the sexual service for money side out, she’s lied to you for months without you having any idea she was lying and for me that’s the issue.

Sex work is hard work and it takes a lot of effort to keep it secret and she has managed to do that for months while living in the same house as you. You don’t mention her being different in the time since as stressed or snappy or anxious but basically the same apart from you both having side hustles.

So there’s a couple of options here: 

1. She really did do the online retail stuff you knew about and didn’t make up clients and details and she topped it up with the findom while still hiding the fact it was a pretty quick go to option to do sex work for wedding cash. 

2. She didn’t really do the WfH stuff and she invented a huge cover story for you about that for nearly 5 months and only earned money from findom. Which if she made up $1000 a week over the last roughly 16 weeks is a serious chunk of change.

How up front is she being now? Has she got accounts showing what she earned and where is that money now? Where you contributing set amounts or as we hustle it amounts to your wedding pot? How much was the wedding budget? How much did you earn in this time and contribute versus what she earned and contributed? 

Because I presume you’d have noticed her putting up 16k in your wedding fund. So where’s the cash? How was she going to explain the high income? Or did she contribute the same amount as you and keep the difference because then her ‘for the wedding’ story has some serious holes.

I’m concerned as someone who has lived the double life of sex work making up a big chunk of my income but not being crazy money so having to have a cover job in retail and never slipping up that she’s managed to do that without any tells, any increased exhaustion or stress and not making any rookie mistakes that you get from learning sex work etiquette on the hop.

I loved sex work but the amount of emotional energy the work and covering my tracks took was exhausting. I made lots of small errors and was lucky no one guessed. It took trial, error and a learning curve to get a work mentality going and pretty much every sex worker has similar rather than going straight in no sweat, no mistakes and no risk of getting doxxed or identified.

And a lot of this is up to you to learn because while there is sex worker support, it’s a freelance job at heart. You never give rivals your contacts and hard won tips in full. You’ll share safety tips and client moaning but I’ve worked across porn, camming, custom clips, full service sex work and pro-subbing and never met a sex worker who gave all the info if you asked. So how and where did your GF get so slick and secretive so fast?

And what are the income implications here? Sex work incurs taxes. How does thousands of dollars appearing in her accounts impact her IRS wise in your state? Has she broken any laws under SESTA/FOSTA that could cause issue? 

How safe has she been with identifying detail on her payment accounts because it’s fucking hard getting paid for sex work online with people like Paypal banning and SESTA/FOSTA making it hard to access legit sites where you used to submit ID and they took a cut in return for kerping your identity safe and using money wire systems you could access easily. 

Just giving janedoe@ domme dot com to Venmo is incredibly risky safety and IRS wise and it looks like she linked her Venmo to this for you to see it which puts her at risk for hacking and blackmail or just a massive tax bill.

So there’s so much she’s lied about or risked your household safety or financial stability over without informing you first and for me that’s massive and would be massive if it was findom, MLM, buying china dolls from magazines, drug dealing or whatever.

But for a lot of people they aren’t cool with partners engaging in activity that put bluntly is solely designed to get other people horny whether that’s sex work or flirting or slow dancing. It’s generally good sex work etiquette to let a partner decide if they are happy with it. I didn’t date people who weren’t and if I didn’t feel safe telling them, then I shouldn’t be dating them.

The idea of doing sex work, not telling my partner and planning to get married is a huge red flag to me because deception is never a good basis to a marriage. I would need full disclosure to proceed with her giving all this info upfront, no trickle truthing, finances laid out and proof (while not breaking her clients’ confidence or identities either.) 

She better be spending til Tuesday getting her ducks in a row to provide open, honest communication and not hiding anything else because this is a huge breach of trust."
536,"You would not be petty to ask your divorce lawyer that. I might even say something to my ex along the lines of, ""I'm so glad we have been able to keep visitation flexible and work together to coparent our daughter, but you have to understand that my recent conversation with GF is making me very nervous about our flexible arrangement and I wonder if we should come to a more formal agreement. Naturally, I prefer our current flexible arrangement, but....""

Your answer to her needs to be the same - some variant of you are only discussing the visitation schedule with your ex."
537,"“How did you feel about John’s behavior at our home?”

When she laughs it off get direct. “He made me feel unsafe. Do you ever feel that way?”

Keep asking questions til she makes it clear she’s done talking. Because yes you may push her away but she also needs to see the truth and she walked that truth into your home and forced you to be exposed to it."
538,"&gt;My FB messenger is logged onto my wife's I pad because I broke my phone some months previously, no biggy, I don't have anything to hide or anything interesting for her to read. About a week later I'm going through my messages and think, you know what, that ""size matters"" thing could be construed as suggestive if my wife reads it, so I delete the thread, just to save hassle.

I can see why she’d be nervous. She had probably already seen those messages and you confirmed her thoughts for her, however innocent they may be."
539,Do you talk to her?
540,"Your partner's inability to hold a job and your increasing non-attraction to them aren't overblown issues IMO. For the former, you are a partnership and it seems as if during this time they are unable to pull their weight as a partner."
541,"I should explain about the insulting thing...

I work in a super male dominated industry and honestly it's the culture there for everyone to rag on each other. Trading insults and stuff, not about anything too serious of course.

The part about calling my coworker a dumbass; stuff like that gets thrown around every day. No real offense meant."
542,"""Husband, while I do appreciate that she is willing to help me out, what she is actually doing isn't actually helping. If anything, she's just getting in my way and it needs to stop. I need you to set boundaries with your mom and if she wants to help, she can ask me what she can do. I do not like her trying to run the place like she owns it and it needs to stop. Especially when it comes to handling our kid, she needs to ask before she can pick him up. How can we communicate this to your mom?"""
543,"""Oh, and the horrible stress of this situation has exacerbated my health issues."""
544,thanks for the advice. I just rehearsed my trombone solo in front of him and he had a proud dad moment Im pretty sure lol
545,"You did nothing wrong. Your husband is upset because either:

1) He is angry that rather than begging for his affection, you have simply moved on and accepted reality. He misses the ego boost. This is a lame, and frankly somewhat narcissistic reaction. 

2) He wanted to continue to live in denial. He doesn't want to face the reality that he is a man with a low sex drive. He is ashamed of himself, and rather than taking responsibility for those feelings, he is projecting it onto you. This is an incredibly immature and self-centered reaction.

The biggest problem in your marriage is not the lack of physical intimacy, it's his inability to take responsibility for his choices like an adult. And by the way, none of this has anything to do with how you look. Neither of you were supermodels on your wedding day, right? He had two working eyeballs when he promised to be your husband, right? This is on *him.* Plenty of us non-supermodels do juuust fine in the boudoir dept. 

I think you need to sit him down and ask him whether he wants to change your sex life or not. If he does, options include him seeing a doctor or you both seeing a couples therapist. What's NOT an option is putting the burden entirely on you to initiate and then throwing a tantrum when you get tired of being constantly rejected."
546,He calls you a b*tch because...you had the ability to sleep in a bit later today? That’s bizarre. I wouldn’t stay with someone who calls me a b*tch period.
547,Ain't that cool when the trash takes itself out?
548,"Dump him via text, he hasn't treated you well enough to dump in person"
549,"&gt; No one assumes a 300 dollar new make up set randomly shows up in their bathroom that they “forgot” they had

I get what you're saying, but there really are clueless idiots with more money than sense out there who genuinely do stuff like this, especially if OP and her mum use the same brands and hit the sales. 

Admittedly it sounds like she knows her daughter received a high value gift and decided OP shouldn't have it, though. Which opens the door to whether or not this is a parenting thing or a control/jealousy thing."
550,"Honestly, there's no reason your husband has to like your friends or want to befriend them himself, as long as they haven't done something to disrespect/insult him or you. (*Also couldn't help but notice he wants you to discard this friend group, which comprises some dudes, for a new mommy friend group of ladies.)* **He also shouldn't be insulting your parenting as a means to get you to change up your social circle.** 

Your description of him makes him sound like he has this preconceived idea of what ""moms"" are or do, i.e. ""Moms have mom friends! They join mommy clubs and write mommy blogs! They not only do 80-100&amp; of childcare, but they LOVE it, too!""

He's also assuming that your kid will *want* to be friends with these other hypothetical children.

I think you should sit down with your husband and tell him how it makes you feel when he makes you feel like an inadequate parent for not fitting into this mom stereotype. If he has separate concerns  about parenting, then talk about ways to solve for that (research, parenting classes, whatever) that don't involve you trashing your friends and starting over with a bunch of moms."
551,"You aren't over reacting.  Sometimes people pay zero attention to what comes out of their mouth.  My SO is pretty emotionally intelligent, but there are times I'm like, did you just hear what you said?  Once I point it out, he realizes it and it's typically because it didn't cross his mind.  Unfortunately sometimes it should.

This comes with a lack of emotional awareness.  Part of that is recognizing how what you do and say impacts those around you.  I'd probably not go one another date.  Not because he said what he did, but because he's kind of obtuse."
552,Ask him to help you with something. He just wants to feel useful and valued.
553,"Unlock her door and go take it and hide ot in your room. 
She got jealous of you. 

This is coming from a mother. She knows its yours. She just doesn't think you should have it. Doubtful she has makeup like that herself"
554,Jesus man your the adult. And you were a teenager once. No one likes watching a sex scene with their parents at that age. Has nothing to do with not being ready for the talk and in all likelihood means you waited to damn long. 14 sex scene could mean an awkward boner with your parents around better to leave the room. Or for some kids worse the thought that your parents did that again better to leave the room at that awkward teenage stage.
555,"How long did she know him?  Grooming takes time, they could have just hooked up at a job, ended up with child, and decided to try and make it work.  Sometimes it just works."
556,"Stop making her breakfast in bed.

If she gets upset or complains that you stopped, then she was being entitled and ungrateful.

If she doesn't care, then she didn't actually want it and you were just assuming that ""breakfast in bed every day"" = ""amazing boyfriend.""

Doing nice gestures for your partner is great, but you've got to do the nice gestures that they actually want. That's going to be different for each person."
557,Only a crazy person would steal a $300 makeup kit because her daughter “doesn’t deserve it”
558,I was going to suggest op check out r/raisedbynarcissists  for this reason because this whole situation is completely ridiculous and selfish of her mom
559,"Yes, exactly this. He does this on purpose and it gives him a thrill. If she stays with him, it will only get worse., not better."
560,"Woah! I wouldn’t talk to her either. Instead of an apology, she attacked we all understand that kids get sick and etc, but no explanation is beyond rude"
561,Tell him exactly what you have written here. Perhaps he has a problem with porn.
562,"I mean....depending on how sensitive your family is....say that.

Be blunt:  *she's a mess and you are trying to push a grown woman off onto me.  A grown woman I don't feel safe around and have no authority over.  I'm not her parent.  If you can't handle her that is your burden to bear, not mine.*

Could you suggest having her go to therapy?  or ... rehab?  maybe try to push that angle too.  In actuality, if she's with you, she'll likely fall even deeper into these toxic/dangerous habits since her parents won't be there."
563,"&gt;I think if he could afford a nanny, a maid, and a high class escort he wouldn’t miss me at all.

That tells you everything you need to know. Not all men are like this, and it's not helpful that people say it all the time as if it's true, like saying ""men only want one thing"", ""they'll put their dick in anything"", etc. You've been asking for a change for so long, so we know he's not unaware. Unfortunately, he just doesn't give a shit."
564,"&gt; I've generally never really liked him sleeping in our bed, but also understand that he is only 8 and needs it sometimes.

I don't know, 8 seems pretty old to sleep in his parents' bed."
565,"She started crying because you insulted ""the wave""??? And now wants you to make powerpoint presentations stating pros and cons about the ""wave""? Yeah, this is definitely very weird. 

Best-case scenario, she is pathologically obsessed with doing the wave. Worst-case scenario, she has absolutely no idea how conflict in a relationship works. I think you need to talk to her and explain that it's normal to have arguments sometimes, you're not always going to agree on things and that's ok. But you need to be able to apologize to each other and move on when it happens."
566,You married a person that now no longer exists. Of course it’s normal for you to wonder if this is sustainable. Can you find yourself a therapist to talk this through?
567,"I think staying where you are is the best choice. His parents are out of the question. Moving closer to your parents would mean not only relying for their physical help, but also financially. You would put double burden on them. Staying also doesn't create any drama and doesn't have any risk to your bf's career. Further more your parents are only 2,5 hours away, not at the far end of the world. They can still come provide some physical help."
568,"You are not wrong at all. Stay firm. I'd be particularly pissed about 2 things 

1) Your exhusband not handling this - i don't think it is appropriate for her to be the prime mover in this discussion 

2) The short amount of time they've been together

I could actually understand a step-mother wanting a little bit of validation around Mother's Day. **\*After they've been a step-mother for a few years.\*** Sounds like they have been living together for about a year and aren't even engaged. Yeah, no -  there's a certain threshold for these things that she hasn't met yet."
569,You're not the bad guy. Your uncle is for trying to pawn off his daughter on you. He can give her life experience from home. She would be better served getting a job and saving up to move out of paying rent at home. That's his responsibility not yours. Disregard whatever input your parents have on the situation; they're not going to have to deal with it. Do what's best for you. What you have right now is fresh and new and most importantly it's working. Protect it at all costs.
570,"They probably don't care otherwise they would have asked you about your stuff waaaaayy back. I think your boyfriend puts too much on some good bags and clothes. I don't see why he thinks he can forbid you from wearing things you've been wearing for a long time.
Besides: what is weirder? Wearing things you've always worn that are good quality without spending an extreme amount of money because you liked the item or suddenly not wearing your usual stuff that people have seen you in a lot just after you told them it's fake? 

Personally I would notice someone not wearing their usual things and I would think something is up/weird."
571,"&gt;I don’t think he brought up the topic to restart a healthy conversation about your sex life because he wouldn’t have reacted that way if that was his intention. 

I agree. I mean, she says in a comment that he frequently rejects/has rejected her, and he has to know that their sex life has dwindled. Her comment wasn't mean, it wasn't hurtful, it was a statement of fact but also with a positive spin in that she's accepted the new status quo, she's not bitter, resentful or hurting. She's okay with it. 

The absolute *only* thing I can think of is that he believes, up until this recent dry-spell, that they did have an active sex life (ignoring prior discussions and higher libido) and is hurt that she doesn't agree. But that doesn't even really make sense in context because they *have* discussed it, and they *have* worked on it so he has to know.

Instead, I wonder if he misses the ego boost of her initiating and him rejecting her? I had an ex who used to complain all the time that I never initiated things, but 9 times out of 10, he'd shoot me down. I think he enjoyed feeling wanted and sexy, even though he wasn't necessarily interested in sex in the moment. So I wonder if this is more what he's missing, rather than the sex itself.

I also agree that your approach is reasonable, though I would caution OP against being too apologetic. I think he was unreasonable here, and she needs to express that while his feelings are valid, his reaction was unfair."
572,"""We discussed it and since other guests have already booked their travel, we can't consider rescheduling.  I'm sorry for the inconvenience to Sis.  Although we would miss her if she can't come, we would completely understand.""

Actually, on second thought... Tell all of the above to your sister, not your Mom.  Something makes me suspect that Mom is using your sister as an excuse to cause drama or get attention."
573,"&gt; You're the side girl in this situation.

Even if she isn’t, the fact that he *treats her* like one, shows what he thinks of OP and this relationship.

OP, **you are a fling to him**, whether or not it’s cheating as well. He knows you won’t last, which is why he doesn’t want your lives intertwined whatsoever.

If you want more than a casual fling, find a new boyfriend."
574,I doubt he's good in bed considering how lazy and entitled he is in all other aspects.
575,"Wow I’m so sorry :( I genuinely feel for you. Your “friend” sucks and so does your ex. I honestly think you shouldn’t be there when he picks up his stuff. I would cut off contact with the both of them and block them on social media. You *could* confront them for closure but I feel like that’s just going to hurt you more. Good luck to you, you deserve a lot better."
576,My parents have said they will help me pay for a lawyer. I will all one today. I can't believe this is happening.
577,I can't believe your therapist recommended your husband move out and leave you with a 6 month old. Who doesn't struggle during a newborn's first 6 months?
578,"&gt; Me being lazy and not having much experience cooking much else is on me though, and I take full responsibility.

Not sure why it's on you to master different cuisines, or why it's ""lazy"" to not cook in a different cuisine than what you are used to? Why isn't he cooking the American dishes he wants to eat?"
579,"""She didn't rob the bank, she just helped plan the robbery and drove the getaway car."""
580,"You should let him know that the moms who work and do all of the stuff at home are called single mothers, because they left their husbands for not carrying their weight.

When you go back to work, childcare and home tasks should be split an even 50/50. (Even now, a good husband would still be helping out in the evenings and weekends). But it sounds like your husband isn't going to pick up any of the slack even if you do start working again. If you don't get this sorted out soon, you are well on your way to a very miserable marriage. He clearly already does not appreciate any of the hard work you put in every day."
581,"Talk to your ex. If your ex isn't immediately on your side within about 4 minutes into the conversation, get your lawyer involved."
582,"&gt;EDIT: Well coincidentally, she just messaged me saying she wants to quit this week and asked what I thought. I told her that we should talk when we get home from work. Any last words of wisdom reddit?  

""With our current spending habits, if you quit this week we'll be homeless within about 2 months so thats probably not the best idea.  Can we sit down and come up with a plan together that works best for our family?""  

I would insist seeing a financial counselor, as well as marriage counseling.  Maybe even bringing this up to her OBGYN if you have noticed significant changes in her personality since the birth of your kid."
583,"&gt; He said that he gets bored with people very quickly – he says I’m the only person he doesn’t get bored of, and he thinks he’ll get bored of Sarah once they’ve had sex or whatever. 

Wait, what? *What the fuck?*

He's even said that? Talked about having sex with her? Goddamn. He cheated on his ex, he's cheated on you before, and given they have already kissed the chances are very real that he's cheating on you now. You still want to be with him, of course, you love him and all that usual stuff, but that doesn't change the fact that he's not only *willing* to put you through this, *he's actually putting you through this*. There's a point at which you need to wake up and acknowledge that you shouldn't be with someone who cheats on you repeatedly."
584,"Given your comments about him being unwilling to even discuss it, I think it would be appropriate to explain to him that you deserve better and to leave. But first, does he display a disregard for your feelings and desires outside of sex? Does he make an effort in other ways?"
585,"Matt is not a cat person. He's just a Matt person.

Young dogs require training but you are taking care of that. You did everything right IMO. Matt has shown a really hypocritical, unfeeling side of himself. And it's downright disturbing he was jealous of Scout. 

So I think his attitude towards Bella is more than the frustration of waiting for a dog to grow out of the puppy stage. You're better to his cat than he is.

And he is going to keep up his hostile behavior until you either rehome Bella or dump him...and I think if you rehome Bella you will never get over it even if you don't dump hm."
586,"Is your spine made of wet noodle? Jesus Christ. Wake that fucking kid up and send him to bed. 8 year olds do not NEED to sleep in their parents bed.

588,"Nope! Not at all okay. I have had dogs most of my life and there is absolutely no reason to do that to a dog. Training is much better by rewarding positive behavior and hitting a dog will not correct bad behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, not sure the best way to handle this, but I would at least tell your other friend C (along with any other friends with dogs that E hits) that you have witnessed E smack their dog and you just want them to be aware of it so their dogs aren't put in harms way. More than that is up to how confrontational you are comfortable with getting. You could ask her in a more ""curious"" way, ""How are you coming along in training your dog? How did you learn how to train dogs? Have you watched Cesar Millan?"" or something along those lines to try to get her to self reflect. I really don't feel like the type of person that is screaming about how obsessed she is with dogs while hitting them will do this though. You could also take a more direct approach and next time you see something say, ""Whoa, damn doesn't that hurt the dog?"" and if she tries to feed you BS about training them, you can say, ""I heard positive reinforcement is much more beneficial and hitting them will only make them fear you."" Totally up to your comfort level, but I would do the more direct approach. Kids and animals can't stand up for themselves. Someone has to have a voice for them."
589,But she extended it to July FOR YOU.
590,"Damn, either she was looking for a reason to break up and found literally the worst one, or valued your race more than you as a person.

I guess that remembering your uncle being white disillusioned her to the idea that you dont fulfill some strange quota of family history, either way you dodged a bullet.

Deciding that your suddenly not Native enough to date is straight up racist when shes been with you for so long. She is also judging you for the passing comment your uncle made...wtf? Just be glad that your next relationship will probably be better than whatever that was."
591,They know they have a large age gap. They know it is weird. This isn't new information to them and they have had 18 years to learn how to talk about it with people. What they don't know are your feelings and I am sure they would like to help you if you are distressed.
592,"She's probably extremely embarrassed. Give her time to get over it, she'll start talking to you eventually"
593,"Just to clarify he didn’t leave his wife for you he left her because his marriage was broken. You were a soft place to land after his divorce. Stop feeling guilty this relationship doesn’t work for you it’s not what you imagined it to be you have no obligation to stay with him just because he’s divorced. 
Also integrating you into his kids life months after their work was turned upside down that just terrible parenting"
594,"I don't have kids so I polled my coworkers. Three dudes, each with 1-2 kids ages 5 and under. One said he'd be uncomfortable but let it continue, the other two said they'd give various body parts to have someone like Carl over helping out.  You usually have to pay for a nanny and handyman.

As a woman who has platonic male friends and a husband simultaneously, I'd trust your wife that she's not going to be susceptible to any of Carl's charms on the off chance he isn't being a sincere friend. 

My first concern with this situation is actually that your wife is taking advantage of Carl's loneliness for free housework and childcare.  My second is that you feel attacked by another person's presence.  That second one is the doozy, of course, but I think it really is exacerbated by stress. 

Both of these should be brought up next time you talk to your wife.  Don't beat around the bush here, please be honest. Tell her that his presence is making you insecure and unhappy.  The positives she listed are good ones, but they don't outweigh your discomfort. Hopefully a heart-to-heart will get her to realize you need more control in the situation.

If you were the one telling Carl to come over and babysit or fix things, would that help?"
595,I try to stop myself from saying that and realized just how hard it is to not say that. It's so much a Midwestern thing too.
596,"I’m so happy I finally found a comment that says this. Regardless of severity, she wouldn’t be in the foster care system without some form of abuse or trauma occurring in her life - hell, just being in the system is traumatic. Trust is a hard thing to give when you’ve been abused, especially at an early age because that may be all she has known. 

Give it time. Keep finding small ways to interact, be involved with fun activities she does with your parents and let her know you’re happy she’s your little sister - but also let her take her time to build that trust. One of the most important ways to recover from abuse or trauma is regaining a sense of empowerment."
597,"Seriously, I got married almost 2 years ago, and I'm still finding stuff I need to change my name on."
598,"You bought a computer, not heroin. Tell them you need it for your school assignments (you do), wanted something that won't be obsolete right away and playing games  is a safe way for you to unwind between studies."
599,That’s not your problem.
600,"Sorry to hear about all this, it does sound rough.  FWIW, you seem to chew over the past quite a bit.  This is understandable, but it usually comes from a place of trying to relitigate the past.  If you could just figure out that one little thing that started this, that one thing that explains it all, that makes a woman in her 30s and 40s act like this, that makes a man not give a crap about his kids, that explains why your life went the way it all did, then you could rectify that and things would get better, right?

Well, no (as I'm sure you can surmise).  Something I've found is that forgiveness isn't about letting the person off the hook.  Hell, I can ""forgive"" people, for lack of a better word, and still would look them in the eye and tell them I'm going to shit on their grave.  But it comes from accepting that as a child, people who were given charge of me didn't have anything remotely close to my best interests in mind.  I was a bartering chip, a useful tool at times, and a nuisance when I wasn't presented as something useful at that moment.  In short, some people who shouldn't have had me around did, and things happened that shouldn't.  The explanation is simple, they're broken people.  No logic will fix this.

Something that started me on this is a mental exercise.  Go to a playground.  Find a girl around 8 years old.  Imagine you split her family (big step, but bear with me).  She says something hurtful.  Now I want you to hate her with all your might.  

It's hard.  Stable people will have trouble with it, at best.  They usually should find it impossible.  But there it is.  You have a crazy woman and a gutless man that cares more about not being alone than his own kids' mental health.  It's not a reflection on you.  It's not anything that excuses them.  It's just an explanation that gets you out of those mental loops and helps you move on to bigger and better, hopefully with your sisters."
601,"If his relationship with his son is so precarious that it entirely rests on the kid getting to kick his heavily pregnant wife out of bed, he has problems.

My siblings and I were big bed sharers as kids. We started learning it was a no-go the same time we started school. By the time we were 8?! Nope.

If you can't bring yourself to wake them up, take yourself to a local hotel. You need a decent night's sleep in an actual bed. (Unless you fit in the kid's bed?)"
602,"I am definitely going to have this conversation with him. He is the kind of person who lives his life with unintentional blinders. It's one of the reasons we didn't work out. I don't think he really conceptualizes the inappropriateness. He may have suggested her reaching out to me thinking we will all come together and sing proverbial campfire songs about it. 

Her youth is something I did judge him about. Love is love, yadda yadda. But there are certain quirks and habits that he has which would be less tolerable if he was with someone closer to his age. But at the end of the day I keep those comments to myself."
603,"If you're miserable and they're mocking you and draining your wallet, you have every right to go home. You don't owe the family any explanation at all but you should probably tell your fiancee that you aren't enjoying the trip and you think it would be good for her to enjoy time with her family alone. That you don't mind if she stays but you would prefer to leave. 

I lived in Europe for four years and had a lot of the same beefs with people I had to spend time with. It's really uncomfortable and they can be really rude about their dislike for Americans. There's good reason to dislike our nation's policies but to take it out on the individual guest is out of line. If you stay you'll probably end up resenting your fiancee for having to be in that situation in the first place. There comes a time you have to do what's best for you, and this sounds like one of those times."
604,"I totally agree. Especially since the impact on your (OP) self image is so damaging. There is so much negative self talk in this post. You are so hard on yourself and, as a woman who dealt with this same thing for several years, I'm guessing it's you internalizing his rejections. I know I did. He wants you to validate his need to feel sexy and virile and he couldn't give a damn about yours or the impact his rejection has had on you."
605,"None of his points make much sense to be honest. And I don't believe that those are his real intentions for a second. Your kid can and will find plenty of friends of their own. And there's no reason to go out of your way to replace your friends with other parents who could be just a clueless as you are.

Sounds like somebody just wants you to ""settle down"" and leave your ""past"" life behind. Don't damage your old friendships for this thinly veiled attempt."
606,"He was also willing to use another person for his ‘high’. He feared this person would not talk to him if she knew he was in a relationship - so chose to lead her on to get it.  That’s the ‘best case scenario’ where he is being honest about not truly being interested in her. 

He’s lying to and using other people, toying with their emotions to make himself feel better. If he constantly has to seek validation from outside sources, he won’t ever be a trustworthy partner. Nor a complete person or companion to *anyone*. His self worth needs to come from within.  Until he works through these issues, he’s in no condition to even be *in* a relationship. OP cannot give him his self worth and her questioning herself as not doing enough or being enough for him is heartbreaking - because that’s what we do. But it’s not her fault and what a terrible position to be in. How would she ever relax and feel happy and secure in this relationship? I know I couldn’t."

Tell her she has 48 hours to sit him down and tell him the truth. All of it.  Then you are going to him, to confirm she has done so. Or tell him yourself if she has not. She has two days to be the right sort of person here, after that, well, you are going to out her."
609,"FtNB here

1. You are attracted to WOMEN, yes? Of course you won't be attracted to someone who is not a woman.

2. Your partner needs mental and emotional support. These are signs of depression and not acceptable behavior for a grown adult. Enabling this behavior really hurt me when I was younger so I stand firm that depression needs to NOT be enabled.

3. Being misgendered sucks. If you're non binary that's life. Life sucks. Deal with it.  (I'm the sole breadwinner and have 2 kids, get misgendered daily because its literally impossible to pass as NB, short on sympathy)

4. You should consider consulting with a divorce attorney just to know your situation and options. This relationship may get toxic fast for you.  Therapy for you as well!


Okay.... 

So coming out as trans is rough.  Its a lot like a second puberty. If they start testosterone it LITERALLY triggers a second puberty.

Remember how stupid you were at 13?  Your partner is back there on some levels.

And being non binary fucking sucks. It does. There's nowhere in the world you fit. You can't pass. It just sucks. 

So the good news is that in 3-10 years, your partner will settle into their new identity and grow a thicker skin and be able to weather this world we live in.

The bad news is: you will never get your wife back.

Your partner also may grow a small penis (look up testosterone enlarged clitoris. No really, do it, is that arousing or boner killer?)

You're likely headed to divorce either way, the question is whether you can help your partner live a healthier life and if so how."
610,"WTF?

Let me see if _I_ have this correct.

You husband was home.  
Because he has no job.  
After you left, he got up.  
Left the house.  
Went to another house.  
Entered that house.  
Went into your cousin's bedroom.  
Sat on her bed and watched her while sleeping.  
Then asked if she wanted a massage.

And when presented with this story. He fucking confirmed it?

Fuck lawyers, call the goddamn police  first. I believe that's still unlawful entry."
611,"don't ask. tell him your needs, and be open to hearing how he will meet them. but this is not you asking him for a favor, please, sir. this is you telling him what the end result needs to be and him telling you how he's going to get it there."

613,"Generally at some point in relationships, usually about the time of moving in together, finances become more combined. When you sit down to figure out how bills or rent are getting paid or trading bank cards for tampons, that's probably a decent time to mention it. Otherwise it's not really relevant."
614,"Oh. Just tell them you never fucked their daughter, dude. Also, you gotta wonder who DID if she's lying about it. I hate putting my money on incest, but I'm in a foul mood today."

617,I think I am ready to follow through.
618,"&gt; ""You really don't get how shitty it is to hear that from your own wife?""

And he clearly doesn't get how shitty it is to EXPERIENCE it with your own husband...for years. You were absolutely not wrong. You were speaking the truth. If he doesn't want to hear it, that's his problem to sort out."
619,"""Mom, I appreciate that you're worried about me, but I'm an adult. It's not reasonable or healthy to expect me to be constantly in touch. I want you reassure you, but I need to live my life and have my own space. Let's agree that if you don't hear from me at all for X days, you can assume something is wrong. Otherwise, I'm not going to respond to your texts about where I am."""
620,"Wow, that is quite the novel. Honestly if this was r/AmItheAsshole I would say Everyone Sucks Here. Your wife for not communicating with you when you repeatedly asked her to, and you for pretty much everything your wife said to you being selfish, angry, and unempathetic. It's is clear neither of you feel appreciated for what you do for each other, the kids, and the household. Maybe couples therapy is in order if you want to fix some of the communication issues and mend your relationship because it will be a safe space for both of you to air your concerns."
621,"I got to that point and said ""No wonder her last marriage failed."""
622,"Yeah, but those reactions are usually, at least somewhat unhealthy. I think culturally, there's a lot of excusing of dads displaying this kind of behavior."
623,"Your husband's are friends so you need to stay civil. But I don't see an issue of distancing yourself from someone who doesn't like you anyways. It's your home, you can invite whoever you want. No need to feel obligated for anything (unless her husband is invited, then obvi she should be too)"
624,"&gt;She is currently not receiving treatment due to some complicated issues (she said she doesn't want to be on medication, and she wants to wait until she moves back to school in a few months).

If she's refusing treatment, she's putting you through hell, and her life at risk.    Refusing treatment for bipolar is a dealbreaker, get away before she decides to turn your life into a nightmare.    It's non-negotiable, you cannot fix her, and it will not get better if she ""toughs it out""."
625,"Yep. The worst part is, is that he's otherwise a genuinely good guy. His infatuation with this woman has legitimately made him a bumbling idiot."
626,"Yeah, this is really burying the lede. He not only insults her and doesn't think he should be woken up from a nap(??) to ""help"" take care of his own children, but he's given up on the relationship?

OP, you said you didn't want us to tell you to divorce, but he's got one foot out the door and has *told you this*. What else is there then?"
627,"&gt; ""youre not fat, you know that, why are you offended at these jokes""   
&gt;  
&gt; ""I apologized what else do you want from me"" 

He is 100% not mature enough for a relationship. Also 55kg is like 120 pounds and he's trying to tell you to lose more?!"
628,I strongly agree with this. Otherwise you could and up seriously embarrassing him and ruining a great friendship. If my parents had the talk with me about any of my male friends at that age I think I would have melted into the floor from embarrassment.
629,"You seem to be very incompatible, and then it got complicated by adding a child to the mix. Consider if you could be just co-parents and friends vs lovers in a relationship. It sounds like either way, you're going to be mostly responsible for your child as he isn't as interested in parenthood. Maybe you should return to your family/support network. Continuing to stay in this situation as is, is making everyone unhappy."
630,"Im kind of getting a feeling that from your few replies, its something deeper than just being outdoorsy with your girlfriend. It seems like you have no intentions to give that part of yourself up, which is fine, but it was never threatened in the first place. Your phrasing it a bit...off. Like it seems you’re expecting your girlfriend to take care of your future kids on a trip while you’re off doing whatever. And that you’d be the sort of dad who’d be like “I enjoyed this thing so you have to enjoy it too”. Idk you’re giving off weird vibes about all this"
631,Agree with this.  I was in a similar situation and only started mentioning numbers when I was engaged. I hinted at it at the time before we moved in but with no numbers
632,"Yeahhh, he said she didn't talk to him for the rest of his deployment. That probably means months. Something something Jody."
633,Exactly. The kid has 3 parents and wife has 2 husbands. Extra help and friendship is great. But I see how it's bleeding into being inappropriate.
634,"This, seriously. He's garbage."
635,"Yeah, people know what trans people are, theres no need to go bumbling around like this."
636,"Let them know how your parents feel and their views.  Tell them you don’t feel safe telling your parents because they will kick you out and disown you.  

You are very strong.  But please do not think it’s ok for this pedo to keep abusing you.  

I really hope you can find a safe place.  Do you have any friends who could help?  Would their parents be willing to let you stay with them temporarily. 

Please tell your brother.  He needs to know his “friend” is abusing you.  

You don’t deserve this!  Please get help."
637,I don't know a lot about adoption but one of my best friends has two adopted sons and a biological daughter. All of his kids have always known about the adoption. I don't think hiding it and revealing it later is the way that these things go anymore.
638,"1. Do you find HIM attractive? I only ask because you referenced attractive guys and it felt like you were saying you dont feel that way about him.
2. Why dont you feel turned on? Is it the lack of spark? Variety? Something else?

I think you need to understand why you dont want to have sex with HIM. That's what matters, then you have to decide if its fixable."
639,"Stop trying to be the ""cool girl"" and stand up for yourself. You're so worried about looking jealous that your boyfriend is **openly dating another woman right in front of you** and you're just sitting there taking it. Like, he isn't even hiding it. You're telling him what he's doing is hurting you, and he's just shrugging his shoulders, saying ""sucks to be you,"" and continuing to do what he wants. 

Is your self esteem so low that you are okay living like this? You're miserable and sad, your boyfriend is openly cheating on you, and you want to stay with him anyway?"

As far as damage done, I'm afraid you'll just have to let it fizzle out. People will get bored of it, and the people who know you won't drink the koolaid.

You should have left her the moment she did that to your friend. She has isolated you, made you give up your career, and then physically isolated you by moving you. 

What she did to that friend was completely 100% not normal, not okay, and should be a deal-breaker. I cannot believe you were okay with this. Your normal meter is broken. You deserve better than this dumpster fire of a wife. You said you don't have a support circle to talk to. Your wife is 100% the reason why.

Get. Out."
644,"Congatulations, your boyfriend is MASSIVELY emotionally withholding! And in his withholding, emotionally stunted bullshit, he's making you chase him. He's making you do all the work. He gets the ego boost of someone as wonderful as you tripping over herself and screaming ""pick me! pick me!"" and he can just go ""I don't knoooooooooow,"" It's bullshit, is what it is.

A thing I used to say to myself when I was younger and dating and not having a lot of luck is, you can always do better than someone who doesn't want you. As in, no matter how good of a person someone is, no matter how kind or sexy or brilliant or exciting, the most important thing is how much they want YOU and to make YOU happy. Without that on both sides, no relationship can last. I am sure that you will find someone who is just as good as this dude in all the ways that he is good, and also wants you as much as you want him."

Neither of these are really preferred ways for trans people to explain their gender!

I think, at this point with people of these ages, saying ""I'm a trans woman"" says enough on its own. It's certainly not anything but be ashamed of, and it speaks for itself! She needs say nothing more unless he has questions."
648,"&gt; This morning he said. ""I should have just left you on the couch. You were acting like a big baby.""

Girl, I'm starting to see why his previous wife dumped his ass."
649,"I think this bleeds into a larger situation of women spending their free time with a tiny human who can't talk and has many needs, and being stuck inside a confined space. OP can go from work to home with some relative freedom. OP's wife is strapped to a child that needs her body for nourishment and is a barf/shit machine. Leaving home is MUCH more complicated when you have tits leaking food, and a wailing child.   


(To be candid, I am childfree and would NEVER choose children. But I can see how women catch shit or are socially programmed to continue these things.)  


OP needs to realize the larger issue. His wife is fucking drowning and here is Carl, handing out lifelines like candy. Yay! Another adult to talk to! Yay! Someone who can feed a completely helpless human while I take a dump in private! Yay! A no pressure conversation with an adult!  


Shit, they're lucky Carl isn't asking for money at this point.   


  
Get a nanny, schedule a date night, shit, take the baby for a weekend and tell your wife to scram and hang out with her relatives or girlfriends, thus giving her some freedom. Seems like Carl has tapped into that void that OP is willfully or not clueless about."
650,He’s in denial about his condition. He’s not a good source of information about his health.
651,"You could go on vacation with a friend that can pay their own way to if he doesn't want to go sith you. 
I don't know the history between OP and BF but he definitely doesn't sound like a winner letting OP pay his bills for 6 months and thinking racking up $150G in student loans was a good idea. His field better pay fucking awesome."
652,Sounds like he only wants you for sex really.
653,"This. She does NOT appreciate it, as she has plainly said. Maybe if you stop doing it, she will re-evaluate her attitude and appreciate it in hindsight, but maybe not. Some people are givers and others are takers. She sounds like a taker."
654,I went through this pregnant. He was the cheater and it did get worse. He accused me of screwing men before work and put a gps tracker on my phone to follow me. Beware. Get out. Best decision I ever made was to leave. Controlling @$$hole.
655,"the problem isn't her job, it's her spending habits. Getting a short term loan to supplement her excess spending is truly SO bad- if my partner was secretly doing that it'd be an absolutely break up worthy offense. Please see a financial counselor immediately or divorce her immediately."
656,"He is horribly abusive and you did nothing wrong. Of course you broke down crying—he was screaming at you! He is a horrible person and you should not stay and get treated like this. I’m sorry that no one stuck up for you, but they were all probably in total shock. Someone should have told him to knock it the fuck off."
657,"This is good.  I would add to remember that mom and dad are around her, being there for her, like 16 hours a day, 8ish of them awake, but I’d be surprised if nightmares and nighttime illness hasn’t come up.  You come by once or twice a week, so like 8-10hr./week?  That’s a lot of time to spend with someone you don’t live with, but nothing compared to the time mom and dad have in.  Not knocking you, just making you consciously aware of it.

Also, you don’t mention her history before being adopted.  Consider that you may remind her of someone who hurt her/ scared her, (same age, same hairstyle, same nose shape, might not be much) Don’t force her to be alone with you, but you can certainly offer opportunities.  And maybe start with not being alone exactly, but interacting one on one with mom or dad in the room doing something completely different.  Play a video game while mom folds laundry, make cookies while dad updates the family calendar at the kitchen table."
658,"I’ve only ever seen fake bags out and about, where did you find shoes and coats? I’m so jealous honestly, especially since you’ve mentioned that they’re good quality

Your boyfriend is overreacting in my opinion. You’re fashionable and smart (why spend 2 grand when you can get essentially the same thing for $40!) and clearly none of your friends thought your stuff looked tacky- they thought it was real, and they thought it was cute"
659,She doesn't have a very good relationship with her mom but her mom hates him and says he makes her uncomfortable.
660,"She’s definitely checked out to some degree. There is a reason she was flirting and enjoying the attention from this guy. I’m not blaming you but it sounds like the time you two were making for each other had been scarce and she therefore enjoyed the attention she was getting from this guy. 

Because it doesn’t appear to have escalated to more than electronic flirting, so the relationship is certainly salvageable with therapy and a mutual agreement to try and work it out."
661,"We share finances but I am more thirfty and earn more than she does, so a lot of that shared money should be jointly decided on. Not spending 500€ on an uncle who calls me Marcel Marceau all the time."
662,"&gt;  I just know he won't like it. 

What's he going to dislike more, a talk with a parent about safe sex? Or a talk with a parent about becoming a teen dad?"
663,"Yeah, including one about consent"
664,"Thank you all for your advice I greatly appreciate it, for my first time wanting to talk to someone it was a massive load off my mind!

You've all been amazing, thank you."
665,"You aren't man, its weird that he is over so often and he is kind of stepping on your toes your wife should respect that and work with you to find a mutually agreeable solution."
666,I don't know what to say except that I'd be uncomfortable too. Could you talk to your dad about it instead of your mom?
667,"As a lifelong Midwesterner this is A Serious Truth. 

And a friend who cares about them being knockoffs is just silly. No one should put that much thought into other people's clothes. If they fit the way you like and you feel good wearing them...then it's a win (especially when you didn't have to drop thousands on them)!"
668,That would be far too easy for Reddit
669,Is it just me or is 8 way too old to be sleeping in a parent's bed/with parents in his bed?
670,"But at what cost? It doesn't really do them that much good to be grades ahead. It's not particularly healthy to be one of these 14-year-old prodigies at university anyway. So why are you turning yourself inside out for it? I do personally understand the appeal of homeschooling, especially if the kids are thriving, but it isn't worth it if it is stifling one or more members of the family. I sincerely doubt it's the *only* place they can thrive."
671,What creeps me out is that he got YOU to change the sheets
672,"&gt;But if he’s bed bound, and can’t move around with risking serious injury, he needs more care. 

He needs to be professionally assessed to determine what level of care would be appropriate - more home care, assisted living, nursing home.   The easiest way to do that is for the bath aide to report the recent fall and request an evaluation -- ask him/her to do that and arrange the evaluation for while you are there.

Also, what is his financial situation?   Does he have the resources to pay for whatever extra care he needs?  Will the house have to be sold to afford care for him?  If so, would your sister and her husband be left homeless?  Can they afford to buy it as a seller financed deal?  

Think about your options in all of this before you see your dad.  Then go in with what you know he would hate the most and negotiation down to something reasonable.  In other words, tell him your sister can't take care of him anymore and you think he should go into a 24/7 skilled nursing facility that would cost $X   Then negotiate down from there."
673,She needs the talk.  She's about the right age.
674,"I would let him contact you next and it better be with a big apologies. Otherwise, sayonara sucker.

No one should talk to you like that and make you feel like that."
675,"Coming to terms with the fact that he has an awful *sense of* smell might help him come to terms with the fact that he has an awful smell (sorry OP's dad).

Maybe he'll realise how bad his sense of smell is if you give him a whiff of something objectively pungent that isn't him."
676,He wants you to say hes so damn sexy and you'll never get over that and you'll always want more of him. But how do you maintain that for years and years? Time to have a frank discussion.
677,Just quit. Why even bother working any hours at all at this toxic place?
678,I don't think he was sorry for being caught. I think he was sorry his ex girlfriend wouldn't take him back so he ruined things with his safety girlfriend for nothing.
679,Yeah. People don't just wake up one morning and decide they are going to enter their spouse's relatives home and walk to a sleeping person's room. This was not the first time he did this. It's the first time he got caught.
680,"Yeah everyone is pushing the John angle. And it’s valid, he’s certainly no friend of OP. But what about his GF? She’s back in town after a trip and doesn’t call her BF to let him know? Then there’s an impromptu party from her perspective and she didn’t think it was strange her BF was missing? These are minimum expectations for a relationship and as a result  I’d be much more disappointed in your GF."
681,"Yes, I’m thankful she’s safe and being well cared for I hope,

But I know she’s going to be going through such a rough traumatic time. I’m so worried for her"
682,"Your wife is controlling and manipulative and abusive.  Nothing you do will ever be enough.

You need a divorce attorney.  In the meantime, separate your finances as much as possible.  And ignore what she wants you to do with your career and personal life.  Stop making your decisions based on fear of your wife being upset or angry.  Follow what gives you joy."
683,"I think with someone her age it should be enough just to say ""why are you speaking like that?"" or ""what happened to your voice?"" etc.
The ""I don't understand what you're saying"" and saying that repeatedly could come of as condescending."
684,"Exactly! I feel this is a typical case of expressing boundaries and respecting them. Also, kids at 8 yo doesn't need to sleep in parent bed anymore. It is not normal. 

If Op husband really want to nurse his kid, then he can setup himself a bed in the kid room. 

Speak with you husband and setup clear boundaries. Do not tolerate anymore kid sleeping in parent bed ever. It's the other way around."
685,"I really like this answer. Give it some time, OP. It sounds like you are a good big brother."
686,"I still don’t understand where she finds it appropriate to text you asking this in the first place. She’s the girlfriend, and until she’s upgraded to wife status, she is disposable &amp; not to be taken serious at this point to even think talking about custody / holidays are appropriate."
687,"He needs to look at therapy for his insecurities. Could be a symptom of hiding depression or another anxiety disorder. Untreated they can get worse. 

Either that or he has control issues and is using this paranoia as a way to try and control your behaviour. Isolating you from other people. Has he ever been jealous of male friends or had issues with you hanging out with friends without him or on a girls night out?"
688,"He's beyond a porn addiction.  The conversations with this reddit person show an affection to them, more than a pure porn relationship.  That's more of an emotional cheating.  That's beyond a porn addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

Throwing away a hard drive did not deal with his addiction in any therapeutic way.  He still had access to plenty of it through the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is going to work he's going to have to deal with the addiction through therapy, and you will have to start watching all the bank accounts like a hawk, because he  has been spending hundreds of dollars that you didn't notice.

&amp;#x200B;

And don't snoop through his phone.  You either trust him or you dont"
689,Damn hit me right in the feels with that one...
690,"Shut that shit down right now. Both of them naked in the spa as if he's an adult? He isn't. Far from it. Maybe he's mature for his age, maybe he's physically developed, but he's still very much a child. This goes beyond inappropriate. Look, this isn't about imposing your view on him but keeping him safe from clearly suspect behavior on your SIL's part. She's either grooming him or she has all the goddamn sense of a brick. Don't let this continue."
691,Sometimes they say the best way to leave is in silence. It will leave her wondering (although she would be an idiot not to know). She showed her true colors and she’s not worthy of a place in your life. Cut her off and go on living your happy life with your new husband.
692,"He had literally just told you that if you did the same thing to him it would be unacceptable.  The hypocrisy is what I couldn't forgive, and I would leave because of that."
693,"???????

What is wrong with you lol, your sister lost he pet today and is ""quite literally crying"" yeah no kidding. Big freaking surprise she is crying and eating ice cream the day she lost her pet! I cried every night for weeks when my dog was diagnosed with bone cancer and we had to put him down and I was in my 20s.

Her reaction is completely normal. Your reaction to her is not. Let the girl cry. Jesus."
694,"Yep. It took me a while, myself, to find a way to incorporate grace into this situation.... but that's exactly it. She has planned this day in her head for her whole life and every conceivable plan involved her mom. So many times she's broken down and just said, ""mom was supposed to have the answers for things like this"""
695,"It's more the fact that my parents raised me to value kindness and second chances, and due to that feel that I'm abandoning Ruby in her time of need."
696,"&gt; some, if not all men, are dense. Your husband should know that you are in a vulnerable stage.

I mean, he knows she's supposed to be on bedrest and still expects her to be the primary caregiver for his other kid and kicks her out of her own bed. That's not dense. That's disrespectful and callous. Nobody is that stupid. He's doing this on purpose. If a doctor ordered her to be on bedrest, for him to allow her to be doing all the work with his other child shows total disregard for her health and the health of the unborn babies."
697,I feel like there's a lot more going on than just Easter weekend. I feel like both of you need individual counseling and couples counseling. Best of luck.
698,"We agreed that I will go back to work after our child starts school. He says some moms have to work to support their familys and do everything at home too so I should be grateful.

As much as I'd love to do what you suggested in the last paragraph, he won't take time off for that. And if I don't do the dishes or laundry for a few days, I'll end up having to do heaps of it later. Thank you for the suggestions and taking the time to reply."
699,"Also, who are these people that they assume if OP has something nice, her boyfriend bought it for her? I buy my own stuff. If I'm wearing something cute, it's because I bought it. None of my friends would assume my husband (or boyfriend, before we were married) bought it and I would find it weird if they did. That's not to say he doesn't buy me nice stuff as gifts, but that's just a weird assumption to me."
700,"&gt;I’m considering just buying her a diamond ring to appease her

DO NOT

The only thing I can think of in terms of why she's throwing a tantrum is because maybe she thinks this is supposed to be an engagement ring and so she's upset it's not fancier. But frankly anyone throwing a literal tantrum because their BF made them a ring instead of buying one is acting extremely immaturely, and you don't need to reward that."
701,"Yeah, it’s important not to say it’s definitely the case, but there’s a reason it’s a red flag - it’s very common particularly in that exact combination of events happening around the same time"
702,"I’d actually say the work issues are almost as important as the no longer being attracted issues. I’d have a really hard time being married to someone who was ghosting jobs (that’s extremely irresponsible, even with dysphoria or mental health problems that’s extreme) and who was sitting home all day with no motivation. Clearly there are some things going on but that doesn’t mean you have to stay married to someone who has changed so drastically and who is being so horribly irresponsible about things that are a big deal. Like having a job."
703,"I don’t respect people who lie to get out of hard situations. My sister does this and I just don’t know what is a lie and what isn’t anymore. How can you take his word that he isn’t going to lie about anything else in the future, couldn’t that also be a lie to get out of this situation?"
704,I've always felt like when my SO came to my training it was a distraction. I was painfully aware of her being there and it would take away from my focus. Still though I would bring her every once in awhile because she liked to be apart of my life and I knew it was important to her. Compromise.
705,If that nurse truly doesn’t do anything then you need to call and report them and get another one.
706,"I feel like you should take this up more with your mom than anyone else. If cousin A is just in l o v e with her boyfriend, but my sister keeps saying stuff against him, it’s kinda suspicious and we have heard so many stories of how love is blinding. 

Also the whole reason they see you as a child is because they don’t see you. My cousins up until they moved back from across the country had three kids, and all of them were still toddlers in my eyes instead of big kids (like 9 years old). They aren’t seeing you make these grown woman decisions, so you’ll still be little until proven otherwise (as with your aunt)

Also with this part
“basic-ass shit that anyone with half a brain of foresight”

A lot of people DONT think all of this through, or haven’t had genuine conversations other than a light two comment thing. Just be happy that your aunt will probably now pipe up and say otherwise when your mom tells them things.

Overall, still congratulations on your engagement."
707,You don’t risk your marriage and your job to finger a chick you don’t even like out of boredom multiple times. There’s something more going on with your bf. Don’t let him tell you it was just “something to do” because a dude might break a woman’s heart for that reason but they will not fuck up their job for that.
708,"&gt;Yet I’m expected to spend my free time cleaning up after him.

Since you are in fact doing that, it seems to be a shared expectation.  Your whole post is framed as asking him to help you rather than expecting him to act like an adult partner when it comes to managing the household. Why are you choosing to live with an adolescent?  Does he behave that way at work?  Why is it okay to do a half-assed job at home?

The first thing you need to do is reset your own attitude.  Your relationship is not good.  There is a level of basic disrespect in your relationship that will eventually erode anything good you feel about him.  Women leave 5/10/20 year marriages over just this ever single day.  Start by reading  ""She Divorced Me Because I Left the Dishes by the Sink"".   It took Matt's wife 12 years to decide that she was tired of the disrespect inherent in a non-participating spouse.  At that point, she took their 7 year old son and left.  Read ""She Feels Like Your Mom and Doesn't want to Bang You"" too.  

Send him links to the articles then talk about ways to change things permanently.  That usually means sitting together to develop a joint chore chart then each owning certain tasks (not leaving it to you to assign him task). As you list tasks, you should discuss what ""meets requirements"" means in each case -- eg. ""laundry"" includes drying, folding and putting away, etc. In the beginning, you should review the chart at set times to readjust and confirm that you are both happy with the way things are progressing."
709,This is the kind of petty-but-not-crazy I aspire to be
710,"Ugh, that reminds me of the ""I'm a sexy baby!"" episode of 30 Rock.

But really you can't change or train other people, and unless she specifically requests professional advice, you've just gotta deal with it. Especially because she has self awareness about it and it's cultural for her."
711,"Gotcha gotcha. Honestly though, I think it's cool. I bought my winter coat used for $13 and I love shouting that to everyone! You do you girl."
712,Counseling.  You need another adult in the room to be able to get her to understand the consequences of her behavior.
713,"He needs to go to Bill’s room because you’re not teaching Bill anything if he just gets what he wants and sleeps with his father. I don’t know. You should mention this to him. You’re not against your husband sleeping with Bill, but you should set boundaries and it’s more appropriate that your husband go into his child’s room if he needs/wants attention regardless of you being pregnant. (But of youse you also need to be comfortable and have needs while being pregnant)"
714,"Get him to a couples therapist so fast he has vertigo for weeks. 

Get your head on straight OP’s husband. Your wife is pregnant with twins, you should do everything humanly possible to make her life easier. Get that 8 year old out of her damn bed pronto.

Your husband is clueless. He needs a stern therapist to explain “Buddy it’s time to get your head out of your ass and treat your pregnant wife like a queen.”

Seriously, this isn’t rocket science OP’s husband! Get a clue!"
715,"Yeah. Reading the title I thought she wanted him to drive there which I could understand him not wanting to do if he has major exams or whatever coming up. But if she is driving there and just wants him to accompany her to go watch some flowers for what can't take more than an hour or two on her birthday after not seen you for a month...then yeah I understand where she is coming from. If you can't make time for a relationship where you are right now (which is fair), then you shouldn't be in one and should just let her be with someone that can."
716,oh wow this might be a very good fit for him. he's a CPA. thanks
717,"""Hey boyfriend. I love the nicknames you have for your sister, it's so cute. But it's a lady boner killer to be called the nickname as your little sister. Can I get my own pet name?"""
718,So basically he wants a 50’s housewife but also feels resentful that you aren’t working? Not good at all. You need to have a chat with him about his expectations and his treatment of you.
719,"So he cried over something he misheard and that somehow gave him a debilitating backache that required a woman heavily pregnant with twins to be kicked out of her own bed?  

Come *on*, OP."
720,"&gt;  A partner should not ask you to give up your work, your friends, and everything you enjoy so they can be happy. 

IE: Do not set yourself on fire in order to keep others warm."
721,"If she wasn’t your sister, would you spend any amount of time socially with her? If all she does is alienate you from friendships and romantic interests, she’s not a very good sibling/friend. 

My best friends in college were twins. We all lived together and had the same friends but for the most part they had their own lives and separate groups of friends from one another. Like them, you might be accustomed to doing EVERYTHING together. You can leave her out of her social life if you want to. And if she is around and starts belittling you in front of new people, return the favor."
722,"My husband and I are big movie people. We LOVE going to see movies together, do it quite often and watch movies at home all the time. Despite our best efforts, our kid *HATES* movies. Won't go to the theater and leaves the room whenever we try to watch one at home.

However he loves camping with just me. He loves playing video games with just his dad. He loves playing in the snow with both of us during the winter.

My point is that you don't get to decide what your kid chooses to bond with you over, and trying to force it is just going to disappoint you and anyone else involved in the process."
723,Sugar mamas are entitled to vacations as much as other people.
724,Or leave his stuff on her porch
725,I think the best advice on here would be to have your BF’s parents contact her. It will embarrass her and you’ll hopefully get your makeup back.
726,"Wtf kind of overreaction could that be??? He went into a sleeping woman’s bedroom and offered her a massage?!? Wtf! No, she’s sleeping, she’s as relaxed as she can be, and you’re in her bedroom!"
727,You should cut back on your gf
728,"According to your own words you've spent whole afternoon entertaining 8 years old kid. That's an action lasting much longer than 30 minutes and isn't a small thing. 

The bottom line: you are supposed to rest. You don't do that. Your husband doesn't seem to give a shit. Do you see where the problem is?"
729,He's not capable of ethical nonmonogamy. He's not worth it.
730,"Yes, please consider that she might have triggers that have nothing to do with you. Things like standing in a doorway so that she has no way to exit seem totally innocuous to the average family member, but for someone with trauma they can be frightening."
731,I don't see anyone mentioning this so I'm going piggyback on this comment... OP please use a condom if having sex and get checked out in case he is cheating. STIs passed to you during pregnancy can be really harmful for your wee one and you :(.
732,"I'm going to be honest here. As I was reading your post, I was thinking ""that sounds like the basis for some really fun roleplay...""

If you're comfortable enough with the guy you're currently dating, have a chat about your teenage fantasies and see if you can't act some of them out. Granted, you won't be able to change the whole relationship style - as you said, that would be pretty unhealthy - but you can have fun with the fantasy if your partner's up for it."
733,"There have been scientific cases of children who did not develop properly because of so little interaction with other people. If the parents are literally not talking to the child, that can cause development issues that resemble autism but are actually not."
734,"&gt; They said it would be stupid to pay for a place to stay while they would let me stay for free

The price of staying in their house is living by their rules, which you're aware of. So, now you have to decide if moving out and paying rent is worth the freedom of having and doing things you want like buying and playing your gaming PC. As someone who dealt with similarly strict, conservative, Christian parents, moving out was definitely the right decision for me. My relationship with my parents was a lot better once we weren't living together."
735,"It's \*your\* bed, \*you're\* the parent, \*you're\* the one pregnant, \*you're\* the one who really needs extra rest right now, and \*you're\* the one actually in pain. It's not ""putting yourself above the kids,"" it's about fairness and making sure that you are taken care of. 

If your husband actually reacts poorly to this discussion, that would be a big red flag on him. And I'm concerned about whether you're ever having your needs respected and tended to if you're this scared to broach this one relatively tame topic. Start speaking up clearly about your needs, without apologizing."
736,"She's not attracted to you, you two aren't sexually compatible anymore, so the relationship is on it's last legs.  But also:

&gt;She's not some random girl I won't see again, I have no issue doing kinky shit with those. 

Work on getting rid of your Madonna-Whore complex before it damages your future relationships."
737,"This was also the impression I got from the story. OP, I think allowing her to get comfortable with you with parents around is the best plan. Even if nothing happened, kids who get adopted later tend to have a lot of issues with trust and fear of attachment. Gaining her trust will be a slow process even if this isn't a factor, but it very well may be."
738,"You're out of rope, OP. Life has no obligation to conform to your fantasies."
739,"I can speak as someone who has a 10 year age difference with my brother. Include her in the conversation as much as possible. I loved when my brother used to talk to me like I was an adult and ask my opinion. Gifts are always special and you never have to be extravagent. I still have a bandana that my brother gave me almost 15 years ago. It sounds like you are doing really great already. 

The one thing I caution you against is acting as another parent. With the age difference, it's really easy to discipline her if she does something wrong. Don't. Tell your parents and let them handle it. Be her brother, let her confide in you, keep her secrets secret (within reason, of course), give her ice cream before dinner, break some rules. It will mean a lot to her to have that bond with you, and it'll be fun for you to get to be a big brother, with the added bonus on experience/maturity."
740,Yeah stress could literally make her lose one of the babies. Going against doctors orders for this guy is a joke. If she loves them like they are her own why is she so afraid to talk to him?
741,"&gt; No one likes watching a sex scene with their parents at that age 

At that age?  Fuck, I'm in my 40s and there's no way in hell I have any desire to watch a Game of Thrones episode in a room with my mom."
742,"I really have to question the way your conversation progressed vs how you presented it here and other conversations about race. Everyone is jumping to the fact that she is a “racist”, but I think that’s an overreach. 

“I’m tired of taking shit from white men” is a very telling statement. This is not something one says after one racially insensitive comment. It is something one says after numerous circumstances of racial insensitivity and/or prejudice. 

While you consider yourself Native American you admit you were not raised that way, nor do you look it. 


Which to me means, however you identify now, you probably were raised the same way many white people are - to ignore the experiences of people of color or minimize them. 

I wonder if this is something that has been building for a long time - after a series of incidents - and you simply didn’t notice. If you honestly can’t think of anything to support this (outside your uncle being racist) then perhaps you should take her at her word.

The current political moment is hard for people of color - particularly for those of us who cannot pass. 

Certain groups feel very comfortable putting their prejudice unapologetically out there. People previously thought of as allies are showing their true (racist) colors. We have taken this huge step backward.   It’s painful. 

I think living through this moment as a POC does have a tendency to make you want to close ranks. To insulate yourself from the prejudice and the justifications people are making for the mistreatment. It’s a defense mechanism. 

In any case, I’m sorry you were hurt, especially if it had nothing to do with your treatment of her specifically. I would just let her go and work on your own ethnic development. 

That feeling of being rejected by two worlds never goes away btw. At least, it hasn’t for me. I wish you the best of luck."
743,"We get fed a load of bullshit by society about how men are supposed to act and supposed to be dominant and all that crap. It's not true. You do you. Teenage boys are trying to figure themselves out, and thus resort to stereotypes of masculinity to define themselves. You're breaking the mold and doing what feels right for you and your girlfriend. Enjoy it and ignore the idiots."
744,"You should consider significantly scaling back your involvement with your mother and father AND developing a support system outside of your biological family.  

Honestly, your parents will die one day.  You need to develop other supports.  

But the way your mother is treating your child is harmful to him."
745,Assigned female at birth.
746,"I imagine she's uncomfortable because she doesn't really know you were half asleep and didn't react very fast because of that, so she might think you were purposefully staring at her and is weirded out. 

From her perspective, she was naked, and you came out into the hallway and stared at her until she covered herself and ran away. And then you just mumbled ""sorry"" and laughed.

I know how being mostly asleep can fuck up reaction time, and I am totally not saying you were intentionally staring af her. But a 17 year old girl who, in your words, you weren't close to before she moved in, might not realize that. She's probably feeling extremely self conscious and embarrassed.

Just give her time and space, don't try and force a conversation, eventually she should come around and be willing to talk about it/laugh it off. Like another commentor said, maybe leave a note on her door saying something like ""I'm really sorry for the awkward situation the other night. I didn't mean to see you like that and I was still mostly asleep, so I didn't react very quickly. If you want to talk things out, I'm ready when you are."""
747,"St. Louis here. Found some wicked cheap loose-fit knee-length women's workout shorts with pockets. Someone complimented them while I was out walking and my response was ""Yeah, paid about six bucks for them, they WERE 20. And look, pockets!"" The next time I saw her she told me she bought four pairs.

We roll with the comfort and the cost."
748,"Ooh, she talks so much shit about techs. I think she'd rather die than cop to being a tech."
749,"According to your telling, you backed off and he initiated pursuit of you while he was still married. That's something he did all on his own. So was choosing to divorce his wife. And even if you'd rejected him completely back then, I bet dollars to donuts he would've tried the same ""oh we're practically divorced"" line on some other girl. 

You seem to have learned a lesson from this situation about the kind of person you want to be in a relationship, and the kind of person you want to be with. Take that lesson and go forward. Staying with this guy won't un-make the life choices he chose to make. 

Frankly, although I'm sure it doesn't feel like it for her, I think Kenneth's ex-wife might've gotten the best outcome in this situation to be rid of this manipulative cheater. And I wouldn't be so sure that ""ugly, drawn-out"" divorce wasn't at least partially thanks to Kenneth's own behavior. If he's playing victim over how he was fooooorced to give up his family to be with you, I guarantee he pulled exactly the same victim shit with his ex."

751,"You are on a bedrest. Not on a housekeeper-rest. How comes you are babysitting your husband's children and running errands? Bedrests are nit recommended by docs without reason. Without actual rest you and babies can get harmed. 

Let me say that: the Couch Affaire is only a symptom of something very, VERY wrong in your marriage."
752,"I told him recently that he makes me feel like I’m just a hole, and he was like “Awww, baby, that’s not true.” But then literally doesn’t do anything to make me feel differently. I don’t think it’s being high maintenance to want to feel like he cares about me for more than just sex. I think if he could afford a nanny, a maid, and a high class escort he wouldn’t miss me at all."
753,"It's not his 15 year old daughter's duty to ""fix"" a grown adult man.  Keep far away from him, never be alone with him."
754,"Wow she sounds fucking annoying. I'd reframe it as if it's a different problem that will be less offensive to her. A problem with your understanding of her, not a problem with her. In other words, lie. My suggested lie would be to act like you interpret this as a joking voice or even mocking voice towards you, rather than a whiny baby voice, and tell her you find it hard to tell when she's joking. This puts you in the vulnerable position, not her, as being the dum dum who just can't get humor. And she can't explain she's not joking without basically saying out loud, ""oh no I'm not making fun of you or making a joke, I'm just uh acting like a weird whiny baby I guess"". At which point SHE'S brought it up, so you can say ""oh okay well I'd rather you not communicate with me in that way"".

Example: ""sometimes I'm not very good at understanding when people are joking. When you use that voice I tend to think you're doing a bit or making fun of me or something and I don't really get what you're trying to ask me or if you're being serious. It makes me confused with how to help. If you need help with something or are trying to communicate with me about work stuff can you just say it straight? It would help me out a lot, thanks!"""

757,"Imagine if you had a female friend that chose to ""free bleed"" during her period so she left period blood on everything she sat  on for that week a month and your boyfriend didn't want her to sit on his couch/floor/bed/chairs. 

No one would even entertain the idea that it's fine, we should just deal with the stains.

Frank is choosing to have poor hygiene. Washing your clothes and yourself isn't a costly exercise. It just takes a bit more effort. If he isn't willing to put in that minuscule effort he can't soil other people's belongings.

Actions have consequences. You smell, people won't want you to be around them and their belongings."
758,"You're taking her too literally.  She said it as part of her outburst in order to intimidate him from retaliating or talking back.  No one is expecting you to ape out at a stranger in a public place he belongs in.  You can be unfriendly and cold to him, and even say something to encourage him to leave, but don't assault people.

The situation was sudden and unexpected, but sometimes situations end up like that.  She wasn't planning on sitting across from a guy facing credible accusations of sexual assault any more than he was planning on being outted.  Getting mad at her for it being sudden is pointless, it's like being mad at her because you got wet from the rain.  She has a reasonable expectation that you will back her up and support her in a ln emergency (which this qualified as), so don't be an idiot and start questioning her judgement and checking her work.  Presumably this kind of thing is out of character for your girlfriend?  If so, good, then it must be very serious and very important for her to have done it."
759,"I have no patience with ""undiagnosed"" mental complaints. She either goes and gets the fucking thing diagnosed and treated, or she behaves like a normal adult and sucks it up.

I have to say that (armchair diagnosis) this is almost certainly OCD, which is TREATABLE. So sit her down and tell her: I love you more than words can say but your OCD will severely harm you, me, our relationship, and our future kids *unless you get it treated*

And if she refuses to get medical help, save yourself and walk away. Because OCD does not get better untreated, it gets worse"
760,"Shit, my husband thanks me constantly for being ok with him going to play disc golf with his friends for a few hours most weekends! Iknow mine is small peanuts, which is kinda the point. It's ridiculous to think he can just up and leave for 2 weeks without any conversation. (OPs SO, not yours, yours seem to be a great guy.)"
761,"You work and are expected to make big money, AND keep the house perfect? What housework does he do? Oh right, he sits on the couch eating junk food. And then he vindictively shoves your pillow on the floor?? Who DOES that??? OP, your husband really and truly sucks. He probably bullies you so much about your clothing and housekeeping to make you feel inadequate, so you won't realize you're too good for him and leave. You're only 29, you can find a guy who isn't married to the couch and an asshole about your clothing choices. 

Like seriously, the only correct response to ""you're wearing THAT?"" is to walk out the door. 

Finally, if he's so sad about feeling unloved, he could try having some lovable qualities."
762,Why was is he in a relationship in this first place if he cant develop attachments. Not as amazing as u think he is. You can do much better
763,"You're under reacting.

Forget the attraction for a minute. Throw gender out of the equation.

Imagine you got in a car crash and were in a coma.  What would happen to your partner?  Unable to get a job, they'd be fucked.

Your partner isn't functioning as a healthy adult of any gender. FtNB here, look misgendering sucks but you gotta eat. 

I was a lot like your partner when I came out and enabling it didn't help. I needed real help, and honestly I needed to pull my head out of my ass and face the real world.

Your partner needs real support. Are they going to trans meetings? Making IRL friends who support them? 

If their mental health is genuinely so severe they can't work, are they taking the steps to qualify for disability?"

765,"I’ve heard the interview process has changed quite a bit even when I was going through university. Although I do not have anywhere near the years of experience he has, I do work in accounting for a big company and about to finish my CPA. In my job interviews, I’ve noticed that companies love asking behavioural interview questions. Responding in a well thought out STAR (situation, task, action, result) method is KEY to a successful interview. Since he’s probably solid on the technical side, he just needs some practice with this type of interview."
766,"I think if it were just my dad, this might actually work. Actually, if it were just my dad we wouldn't be talking about this. 

But... if it really and truly is about the kids, I suppose I could mention it. Though 2 things irk me about this: I don't know if I'll ever have any of my own (biologically) and I don't know if he'll accept the ones I have now because they aren't mine."
767,The respective ages stuck out to me too. I suspect these guys are losers.
768,"Say nothing to her father.

If he chooses to speak up, tell him point blank that this discussion is closed. He has deeply and profoundly hurt his daughter and insulted you both right before your wedding. Unless he wishes to apologize for the terrible position he put his daughter in when he attempted to make the wedding about himself and his new GF, there is nothing to say.

Also, who the hell invites a plus one to a wedding one month out? An asshole. That's who. 

Tell your fiance she's a rock star and that she has been treated poorly by her father. Tell her to hold her head high. She can be happy her father has worked out a relationship that is important to him, but still hold him accountable for the cruelty he subjected her too.

You can't fix this for her, but you can stand firmly in her corner and be on her team, and tell her you don't believe she did *anything* wrong. Her father was cruel and selfish. His GF was petty and self-adsorbed. 

You may also want to ""assign"" a family member to dear old dad at the wedding. Now that he's going stag, he may need to be managed and have any nastiness he chooses to share directed away from you and your bride. Having people who are a bit aware of the issue doing some handling might be helpful."
769,"Dude she wouldn't care about this thing at all if you hadn't framed this as ""I'm a super-patriot and whatever my country asks of me I will do, oh and by the way my country goes to war every 50 years so this will probably happen in my lifetime."" You basically told your pregnant, incredibly vulnerable wife that she is your second priority and that you may (will probably) die in service to your first priority. And you're surprised that she hates this idea? 

You could have simply told her ""hey, I have this legally required training back in my home country I need to be at for a couple weeks, I asked friends A B and C to check in on you while I'm gone, I'll miss you but I'll bring you a souvenir!"" In fact, I STRONGLY recommend you reframe this in that context.

STOP TELLING YOUR PREGNANT WIFE YOU'RE A PATRIOT WHO WOULD DIE FOR YOUR COUNTRY. She needs to know that she and your unborn child are your first priority. And for their sake and yours, since it sounds like they are NOT your first priority now, I hope you reevaluate your principles. Because that woman and the little baby inside her need you more than your country's army ever will."
770,Then he told you to fuck off and leave him alone after you gave your opinion on the movie. This isn't someone who's mature or mentally healthy.
771,"Yeah...he went over when he knew she'd be alone, and then climbed onto her bed while she was sleeping and vulnerable. That is straight up predator behavior. He left when she asked....this time. Next time he might take longer to leave, or maybe he won't leave at all. 

This is ""report to police"" behavior even without the creep behavior, anyway. He didn't have permission to be in their home at that time, that's trespassing at the very least."
772,Not telling the kid he’s adopted and letting him treat you like a regular aunt and then finding out later in life is a TERRIBLE idea. Studies show kids are better adjusted adults if they know they’re adopted from the get go. Lying to this kid about who his biological parents are for years and then him finding out (with all the 23 and me/and medical records for the kids health etc. it’s nearly impossible to keep these things a secret forever. Not to mention the possibility of your crappy mom telling just to fuck up your sibling relationship even more etc.) y’all need to talk to a child psychologist or do some research etc. and figure out how to go about this. Playing it all by ear and planning to lie to the kid indefinitely is a great way to have them end up with a huge therapy bill and serious trust/abandonment issues once they’re grown.
773,"Yeah that's child services territory.  The longer your nephew is in that situation the worse the long term effects will be.  Just be aware that your brother almost certainly has to see signs that his son is not well, and is either not stopping it or actively participating in the neglect.  So don't expect to get rid of your SIL and have everything suddenly be peachy."
774,"Of course she doesn’t know how to help you. She’s you’re fucking partner, not a psychologist. Go invest in therapy."
775,"First, thank you for your kind comment. :')

My fear is that testifying will be traumatic for them. For example my 12yo will have to admit to other adults that people that are supposed to care about him call him fat. His self esteem is already struggling from this. My 13yo is not ready to out himself to anyone he doesn't trust. Plus - to a lesser extent than his family - their dad can be a bully himself. Any hint at me ""taking away his rights"" would not go smoothly for any of us. The children might be likely to do things that would please their dad because they constantly seek his approval, whereas they know and trust that I will love and support them no matter what."
776,Thanks this is really good advice! You are right about the breakdown in communication- I’m sulking in bed he’s playing video games! Also our native languages are different so that makes it harder sometimes especially when things are tense. Thank you for taking the time to respond! Much appreciated
777,Cigarettes also don't really go on sale lol
778,"Good call. I think you know this, but it's worth repeating that one should never force a sexual harassment/assault victim to report, or report the incident without their consent."
779,"Maybe her ex doesn’t communicate with her for a reason.... she is being unreasonable and you are being a pushover. If you leave now, you’ll be much happier two years from now."
780,"Bro, this chick is a trashy golddigger. You can do better."
781,"if you don't think you can handle an animal at home, you could consider volunteering at your local shelter. 

or volunteering in general until you have a job again. it gets you a schedule, social contact, and the good feeling of helping someone else. 

another idea is to grow a garden. even on a balcony or something. just to see things grow and flower? very hopeful. 

could you go visit your brother? how come your ex got all the friends?! have you asked if they would like to hang out separately? 

try to do one nice thing for yourself everyday. one thing to make you smile. it will get better :) our hearts are so resilient and you will find a new job, new friends, and eventually new romance."
782,"She isn't snarky at you because she's going through a phase. She's snarky at you because you didn't handle this properly. 

&gt;She always protested form the beginning, but we told her it was the best for him

This was appropriate when explaining to her why you were choosing to send away the turtle and explaining to her that it was not negotiable. 

&gt;I finally told her this was the best for him even if it hurts us 

This was not the appropriate thing to say when the turtle has already been sent away and she is feeling obviously sad. 

Things you could have said:

""I know you are feeling crappy because of turtle. Do you want to talk about it? or would you prefer to be left alone?""

""It's okay to be sad. I'm sad too, and you had an even stronger bond with turtle so this must be even harder for you."" 

Calling her ""snarky"" and attributing it to a ""teenager phase"" and saying that it's easier for you because you're older... that's all very dismissive and patronizing and yes, inconsiderate. The loss of a pet is real and intense and emotional even for adults. Instead of expecting her to just get over it, maybe try to imagine how bad she must feel and then how you could support her through that - not just wanting her to get over it and stop being sad, which is what it sounds like you want right now."
783,Ya I get that. But now you gotta do it.
784,"I’m dating a single dad for the first time, and we were both very clear when we started dating that his son always comes first. 

His son is the most important thing in the world to him, as he should be. I would never try to steal that spot! I’m a fucking adult, for crying out loud. I can be envious of a child, but to treat them poorly out of jealousy is cruel. 

And I refuse to date a parent who doesn’t put their children first. 

I don’t understand how it’s so common, but it keeps happening because of shitty parents."
785,"&gt; He says some moms have to work to support their familys and do everything at home too so I should be grateful.

Nope. You take care of your child and home, he takes you for granted."
786,I don’t know what to say other than you two don’t seem compatible.
787,"As others have noted, it sounds like he wants you around to train this new hire and then you're ""excess to the company's needs.""  So, get that resume sharpened up.

What do you say/do?  If he fires you, be cool.  If he's ""taking things in another direction but needs you in the transition,"" say ""of course, whatever you need"" and crank up the job hunt.  There's no point in quitting without the next gig lined up, don't get angry and don't cry.  Your mantra: You're a pro and it's their loss.

Here's some advice for all the next jobs (you can stop reading here, it's depressing in hindsight):

1. If you want a job, don't waffle.  ""Absolutely, sir, I know this work and I'm ready for it.""  Don't check with partner until after that.  You can always say ""Due to personal reasons, I regret I can't accept the promotion at this time.""  (Never say ""I'm not ready for it."")  Then don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain).
2. Never even hint at potentially relocating unless a transfer is possible (even then, watch the weather vane).
3. If at some future point after getting a job you need to relocate, be honest but vague. ""My personal situation has changed and I must move out of the area.  My last day will be X.""  Then don't JADE.
4. If it's really soon after your hire/promotion, they will be angry and there's nothing you can do or say to change that.  However, if you can do so (whether they're mad or not), offer to stay on to train your replacement.  They may take you up on it and pay you for it or they might escort you out.  At the end of the day, you gotta do what you gotta do.  It's not personal, it's just business.
5. Keep your private life private.  Your ""issues"" may've played into his decision, depending on what they are.  If your mom is sick in another state, that's your business, not your employer's.  Never seek or expect sympathy.
6. Don't confuse desperation with admiration.  You'll be ""such a good fit here"" if they need a butt in a seat rtf now and ""not working out"" when their vision of the perfect candidate (or their nephew) shows up next month.

The work world isn't like it was when I was your age.  There's no expectation of loyalty from either side and employers have most of the negotiating power.

Your power comes from the façade you show as the eager, capable employee.  Any chink in that armor could be viewed as a future expense (Sick mom? More PTO taken, less time working someone out there could do this job for less, anyway.)

Sorry for this...*thing* I wrote.  I've been on your boss' side of the table and seen how it is today and it saddens me that your generation seems to be viewed as replaceable drones, each one just like the next.  I think it's harmful to all of us.  Societally dehumanizing."
788,"This will not get better. It will get worse. When/if you have kids are you going to be the only one taking care of kids too? 

Im not for ultimatums but I definately would do this. Let it get nad and make him face his issue. I would also talk to him when he wakes up. 

This would he my hill to die on."
789,"Absolutely. Even with adults, I find it's easier to build rapport/affection with someone by sharing experiences than by just talking/intentionally ""getting to know"" them. I wonder if it's the relational version of ""actions speak louder than words""?"
790,Then you have to decide if it’s worth staying with him. As nothing will change if you don’t at least have the conversation about it. And you are so young - don’t waste these years being unhappy.
791,A confrontation will likely go nowhere. I don’t think he would ever own up or admit responsibility for way he treated you. Just block him and move past it.

Do they run together every night?"
794,"Yeah we honestly haven't talked/hung out really since like December I think but he was still kind of there since we have two classes together. Haven't talked to him since and this just kinda broke the straw. Honestly there's not many people but my friend Adam just told me if he can get work off he will go with me. He graduated last year, thank you for your comment."
795,"Make no mistake, these issues end marriages. In all seriousness if you have done this stuff already then it may be time to suggest to your wife that she has a problem that requires professional intervention. The problem with many people who are terrible with money is that they have been raised that way and it's all they have ever known. That's an incredibly difficult thing to break out of. I wish you all the best with resolving it."
796,"You're saying you're confident, but you're still letting these people make you insecure. I would put more effort into ignoring these losers and focusing on what's important. Living well is the best revenge, so when shit like this happens I'd just take it as a challenge to have the most fun and awesome day, and make your relationship the strongest and best healthiest relationship you can, because their goal is to make you feel like shit and undermine your relationship and right now, whatever you're trying to tell yourself, they're slowly winning. It's up to you to rise to the challenge of fully enjoying your life and relationship and quietly proving to yourself how fucking stupid and shitty those people are."
797,"\&gt; Adults are mostly just aging kids trying to do the best we can while having more responsibilities and trying to appear like we have our acts together. It’s a big secret but I’m going to let you in on it now because your mom seems like she’s working extra hard on it.

800,"Is your main worry that you're going to have to take care of your own kids by yourself sometimes?  It might be a good idea to just hash out what your view of a mom's parental responsibilities vs a dad's, and see if that aligns with your girlfriend."
801,"Dude, I hate to break it to you, but she is probably projecting her current cheating onto you. She probably is Jody hunting as soon as you leave for deployment, it's probably why she didn't talk to you your entire last deployment. Even taking the cheating possibility away, she is insecure, petty, emotionally abusive, and an all over Dependa. Sorry but this sounds like the stereotypical dysfunctional military marriage I've seen many times in my life before, and it's likely to get worse the longer you prolong it."

803,"You’ll probably have to do what a lot of straight cis women do - appreciate the moments that come close to sweeping you off your feet, and indulge in fiction for the rest.

If someone doesn’t do any of that, ever, you may not be compatible. But if the person you’re with does make the occasional display of assertiveness and desire, make the most of it and encourage more.
You may have to ask specifically for behaviours that you want. If he’s comfortable with eventually doing those things spontaneously, that’s gold.

804,"Doesn't go to sleep? Has she actually spent a week or more not actually sleeping? When I was her age I actually went through a manic period the not sleeping was part of it along with other things, so this could be a bit more than bad behavior but she may need some serious mental health help. Take pictures of your wounds, call CPS, go to the police, force your parents to help her."
805,Maybe trust OP that she knows these people better than you? 🤷‍♀️
806,Would you want your kid staying with someone who did this to them?
807,"ok I need to know about ""Batman wants cheeseburgers"" immediately"
808,"&gt; she's horny all the time but doesn't want to have sex with me.

It's over dude. She doesn't want you anymore. Don't lower yourself to staying with her just because it's been a few years. Why waste any more time?"
809,"This! First, don't change your own name. Second, I suggest counseling. It doesn't sound like you and your husband are quite on the same page about how seriously you should each take your promises to the other, and how, if push comes to shove, he's gotta choose you over his parents (let alone the mere *possibility* his parents will be disappointed). My biggest concern isn't even the name-change agreement renunciation specifically... but about what your husband's backtracking here signifies about his future willingness to prioritize his parents' (real/imagined) preferences over yours. What if you've mutually decided not to have kids, but his parents begin pressuring him for a grandchild? Or to live and work in a specific city, but he thinks his parents would like him to move closer to them? Etc.
