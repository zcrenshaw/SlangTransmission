0,"This is one hundred percent the best solution here--she definitely needs a therapist and she definitely needs someone on her team (so that she learns how to properly deal with her issues rather than continuing to do very dangerous and illegal acts). Be on her team and also push for her to get into therapy, because while you can be on her team, she needs a therapist to help her change these behaviors."
1,"Why are you so intend on forcing your partner to stay in a relationship with his mother who abuses both you and him?  The poor guy had gotten some space between the two of them and here you come, wanting to okay happy families with her, and it’s not working. Drop the rope, OP."
2,I told them what another Redditor said about how they're taking this out on an innocent animal that they agreed to care for and they told me I was ungrateful and they're taking him to the shelter tomorrow. I'm going to see if anyone can hold him at their house and I can fix this.
3,"No one else can decide what you should do, but something that might help you: pretend these women are two sides to a coin. Your ex is heads, the new girl is tails. Now flip that coin and say it lands on tails. Are you disappointed or relieved? There's your answer!"
4,She's a wack job. Most married people I know have used condoms at some point. It's none of her business and her behavior was intrusive and rude.
5,"Love is not all it takes for a relationship to work. It also requires generosity, understanding, and acceptance. Three things I'm guessing he has in rather short supply."
6,"&gt;	true, how does shunning love help you love yourself? 

It doesn’t but that’s not the goal. The goal is not wasting the guy’s time or setting him up so he sad when I finally work up the courage to do the right thing. 

Me loving myself is impossible. You may as well ask a snake to give you a high-five."
7,"Yeah I can't take the pill because I'm lactose intolerant so I used condoms for years in all my relationships. They were never really an issue. I got an IUD recently and it's great so we'll see how that goes. Incidentally, my Dr told me the opposite of yours, that if my body expels the IUD, the replacement one is far less likely to be expelled. Anyway, your friend needs to back up and get her nose out of your sex life."
8,"Have you raised your concerns with Kyle previously? If not, he's likely upset that you went over his head before talking to him. It'd certainly annoy me.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, how moody are we talking here? Has anyone actually complained about him, or simply made comments? As long as he does his job and those that he supervises do their jobs, I'd recommend leaving it to the higher ups to deal with his moodiness. Unless it's actually causing problems in the workplace, it's not really your place to try to change him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would recommend speaking with him about it directly, and trying to reconcile your differences. If you think he'll react badly, try to have someone from HR or a supervisor within earshot."
9,I dated someone once who said they hated cats. That was the end of that relationship. To each his own but for me it was a big red flag of the character of that person.
10,"To quote the great Ron Swanson:

""Live your life how you want, but don't confuse drama with happiness."""
11,Maybe she uses cocaine
12,Why does she care so much? It is literally NOTHING to do with her. Other methods of birth control dont suit you so your picking a more suitable option.
13,"You want more time with him. He can’t provide the time. 

Either you accept the quasi long distance relationship or you find someone new."
14,"Next summer is far enough away that way think you can safely rescind your offer. Do it sooner rather than later, though, because the polite thing is to give as much notice as possible."
15,How does he treat you in daily life?
16,"I probably would have said something along the lines of not wanting to be a baby factory, or since when did you guys join our relationship and family planning... then again I can be an asshole.

Your productive choice does not involve her.  She needs to butt out."
17,"Ignore the ones from old acquaintances/HS friends. Just delete them and move on, imo they aren't worth mentioning since those people don't affect you or your BF.

His friend, however... how close is this friend? If you have photos of you and BF on your page, then I think it's worth mentioning. ""Hey BF, I got a random message from _____ today, do you think this is a little odd?"". I've gotten follows from random friend's of my BF's that I haven't met yet or people he doesn't really talk to anymore and he just tells me ""eh, that's really weird but they're harmless"" or something to that effect. Never gotten messages though or else I'd 10000% tell him."
18,"As many comments have already told you he isn't good for you! Red flags all over this controlling dude. Leave!

Find a new roomie that would be fine with pets asap! Check if there is a subreddit for your city and ask around if someone wants to be your roomie."
19,"Don't worry about it failing! I know that sounds like silly advice given your dating history, but sometimes you know in your gut when it 'feels different' than other guys you have dated. I was your age when I found myself in the exact same situation.

I've had a string of horrible almost-boyfriends and guys I've dated who 1) ghosted 2) fizzled out 3) ended up being shitty for the last I'd say 2-3 years. Every time I'd tell my amazing, supportive friends about the newest guy, I could see them trying to be happy for me  but also that kind of look like... oh here we go again. I met my current boyfriend on Tinder (all my friends thought I was crazy) and 10 months later I'm the happiest with someone I've ever been in my life, and he's expressed nothing but the same. From day one he communicated with me clearly, made his intentions known, and we share the same values without a doubt.

When you meet someone you feel it 'click' with, you know. You've learned from the past and hopefully can apply some of the red flags and negative traits from the other guys into this situation. Does this guy communicate clearly? Plan dates? Reach out first? Talk about future dates/hangouts? I knew my BF was the one when after just a few dates he bought us tickets to a concert the following month- it proved to me that he saw himself with me. Pay attention to these signs.

I hope this works out for you (: and even if not, I'm sure your friends will be supportive. A true friend won't ever told you ""I told you so"", they just want to see you thrive. If possible too maybe keep this guy under wraps for just a little bit longer so you can put your energy into this relationship without worrying about what other people are thinking- your friends don't need to know everything quite yet!"
20,"Ugh yeah. I tried telling him , I asked a friend to reach out to him , things like that. He told me not to contact to him so f*ck. I hope that in a month things will be different. Because I do like him, quite a bit.  And all I want is my friend back. It hurt me when more when I he sent me a picture of him, because that means he saved pictures of her. 
 It hurts not only because he is dating a girl that is quite a b*tch , but he won't listen to me, and used to tell me up until this happened that he'd like to date me, that I'm an amazing girl, etc."
21,ya he tries to help and i don’t blame him bc i haven’t even been able to make myself orgasm yet so he wouldn’t know either but we don’t see each other a lot so we don’t have sex for like months sometimes so that also contributes i guess. so none of us are really at fault here. i guess i just need to experiment
22,"That just refers back to what follows. If you genuinely feel yourself too much a burden and can't live with it, then you have your answer. If you're okay with him being okay with your problems (if he is), then where is the issue?"
23,"You did right by the both of you, OP. You listened to and advocated for yourself. Keep at it. You'll find someone.

And good luck with your career. You seem to be doing well and I really hope the best for you."

25,"Have you asked her how she likes to be seduced? It sounds like you may be doing things that **you** would like and then getting angry when they're not what **she** wants. (Speaking personally, sex at 7:30am is the last thing in the world I want. I know many people feel differently!)

You use phrases like ""catch hell"" to describe her response to you turning down sex. Does she get angry with you for turning down sex? Because if so, that's a problem all on its own. The answer isn't for her to put out more in return, it's for her to cut that shit out."
26,"&gt;First things first, I do not know why I felt so wrong and anxious after making us official/exclusive. 

It's very simple. Because you don't want to be exclusive with her."
27,"I feel like this illuminates a lot. Her own life is garbage, so she is searching for ANYTHING she can about you to put you down so she doesn’t feel so inferior. It’s very petty."
28,"It's not ending because of your cat. It's ending because of this:

&gt;Yes, he is not great at conflict resolution and his responses often feel childish to me. He says stuff that shuts down the conversation. 

This type of behavior is incompatible with long term happiness."
29,"You're both right. I agree lack of sexual happiness is a valid reason to end a relationship, but given that I'm really quite fond of this relationship, it would be dumb to end it without making an effort to improve the sex life."
30,"As others have said, you can’t just remove yourself from cards or mortgages. I had a joint account in my ex and we both had to physically go to the bank with our ids to sign stuff to close it when we broke up. And it took a week once the paperwork was done to actually be actioned. You are being lied to by your whole family.
You need to stop believing them and let them deal with it.
You said that you can’t support your brother and your mum, but why should you? They’re both adults and capable of getting a job to support themselves!"
31,"I doubt what he said was a lie - just saying that “the pussy was good” and that you’re hot isn’t exactly an offer to see you again, though. I’ve had guys say I’m fun in bed (which I know I am lol) but still never speak to me again or sleep with someone else immediately afterward."
32,"You know there are other dobies in the world, right? Just...get one."
33,"Anne, go fuck yourself....no condom needed."
34,"Does it really matter if they hate you? Like, do you think that once you turn 18 and leave amicably on their terms that they still won't treat you poorly and suddenly respect you and treat you well? I wouldn't get your hopes up about that or you're going to be disappointed. I'm not saying that the relationship with you won't change, being independent from them will cut out a lot of the crap they can pull and get away with, but that won't stop them from trying to manipulate you nor will it make them treat you with respect."
35,"Well, you're only 20, so you don't have to be in a relationship that's going to be your end-all be-all marriage and kids type of commitment.  You have some time to have fun if that's what you want.  It's up to you if you want to get back with your ex, but my suggestion is that you don't get together with the girl you already think you will have a boring relationship with.   Being with someone who you already know doesn't excite you will only get her hurt in the end.

At 32, I love my comfortable relationship and can't wait to be boring with my boyfriend for the rest of our lives.  But it's because I had almost a decade of the rollercoasters.  Eventually you get tired of it and you just want to laze around in pajamas with somebody you love unconditionally."
36,"Out of one toxic relationship and into another. Your pets come before any person. Do you not see these red flags waving in your face like a wacky arm flailing inflatable tube man? First off, dude doesn’t even want to provide for you or himself. I’d move into a nice house with a S/O for cheap rent, vs living in a pig sty with 3 other men for free. Also, 6 months seems awful soon to be talking about moving in, especially with the criteria that he has set. I hate cats and their smell but I don’t tell my bf he has to get rid of his cats, and he doesn’t enjoy dogs like I do but he doesn’t tell me to get rid of my dogs. Also that stupid ass reason he gave you for why he hates a fucking dope ass lizard, should have rung a bell in your head to realize how fucking stupid this dude is. Get yourself away from him. He saw a little girl needing saving, and he swooped in. Stockholm syndrome is a real thing and you have it."
37,This does not make it any better. 19 year old dudes are not close friends with 14 year old girls. Creepy and disgusting. Run from this guy. Gross
38,"If you let him move in, you will be supporting him for the rest of your relationship, and also doing the majority of the chores. Do your plan instead and maybe get a better boyfriend."
39,Yeah I wondering what this person offers OP at all.
40,They were getting frustrated with the smell. My dad was cleaning it as soon as he used it but the smell is too much for them and it makes everyone in the house sick because even if you clean it asap there's a period of smelling the poop and that's what they were tired of.
41,"""Was it the lack of freedom to sleep with other girls (which as a 21 y/o I still want to do)""

Do not underestimate this feeling. SO many couples fall apart because of infidelity and cheating. The last thing you want to do is go into a relationship and feel the need to cheat on this person. Part of dating is learning, then acknowledging, then accepting each other's flaws. I can promise you, as you get older, you will see more attractive women than your best friend (it's just life). A committed relationship establishes a boundary that even if someone new who is more attractive or someone who treats you better than how she treats you shows up at your front door, you are a man of you word and choose your SO, and that's a commitment a lot of people underestimate and break. Being honest with her was the best decision you could have made."
42,Loveisrespect.org is a great resource.
43,"There is nothing you can do except to tell her if she needs help leaving him, you'll help however you can. Tell her she's always free to call you/ come to your place even if it's the middle of the night. Say you'll come and pick her up if she ever asks. You can call a women's help line and ask what they recommend. I'm sure they get asked this a lot by caring friends."
44,"And he knows what this girl did to make your school life hell? If so, then how good of a friend is he even if starts dating her and blocks you?

One wild thought, I wonder if this girl isn't just using him to hurt you, like she's not really interested in him and got with him and convinced him to block you (it sounds like you both like each other as more than just friends, so it's not an unreasonable thing to ask of him).

You don't have much choice other than respecting the fact that he wants some space. I guess hope for the best (that she is just playing with him) and that he realizes what an ass he was and apologizes so thoroughly that you can be friends (if not more) again, but expect the worst that he isn't who you thought he was and that your friendship and hopes of being with him romantically are over."

46,I don’t think you’ll ever know the truth.
47,"My advice is: get all new friends. Throw all the old ones out. 

They should not get mad at you or make it into some tragedy if you pull away slightly. This is a sign that they are bad people. When my friends pull away from me, I ask them if things are OK between us or if I did something wrong. Or I just feel a little sad and say nothing and hope it’s temporary. Or I just stop hanging out with them. I do not try to make them feel bad or guilty for being distant. I do not feel entitled to their time. I feel lucky if they choose to spend it with me.

Your friends are taking advantage of you and taking you for granted. They are not good people. Toss em. 

Make new friends, and take it slow. Match their level of interest and care, or go slightly beyond, but only slightly. If they communicate maturely with you, listen and keep them around. If they ever get mad at you and try to bring you down, toss em."
48,"Hey Anne, mind your damn business"
49,"Your dad is clearly and obviously lying about the financial elements. Seemingly, you can’t trust anything that comes out of his mouth. Unfortunately, your mom has either fallen hard for his lies, or is actively helping him lie. Either way, that means that neither of your parents can be trusted to give you *reliable* information about their situation (or your relationship with them)."
50,"Oh god, please don't validate the ""I can't be racist, I have a black friend"" nonsense."
51,"They agreed to smelling cat shit every day when they agreed to getting a cat (if it's an indoor cat)

Well they sound like shitty people, the fact their taking him to the shelter in the morning just proves your point that they don't care about him even further"
52,"I definitely understand why she wouldn’t say something at the end of the night. Whether she told the bride/groom right then &amp; there, or told them the next day or a few days after, the mantle is still broken. It’s not immediately rectifiable. So waiting so that the bride &amp; groom can remember their wedding night as it should be (going off without a hitch) makes sense. No one wants to leave their wedding reception party pissed off at their friend for costing them money."
53,"I totally understand that as time goes on humans change. But I don't think that it's a great excuse for being stubborn, irrational, or acting poorly in public."
54,"You're in another toxic relationship. Dump the guy, keep your pets."
55,"The only reason that I suspect something is because someone thought that they saw her with someone else, but they didn’t seem quite sure about it.  I’m not sure I know what to believe."
56,it might help for the op to a be a bit more emphatic and say that she won't look after the dog.
57,"While nobody is actually perfect, she sounds like she was good to you and good for you. It seems like she had to do what was best for her, and she decided that the best thing would be to move on and away from you. If you love her as much as you say you do, the best way to show her that would be to respect her wishes and no longer make it her problem. I understand that moving on is difficult and you say you don't know how to go about it, but she's made it clear that she doesn't see you as a healthy addition to her life anymore. That love you have for her needs to translate into respect, and you should respect her by staying away. 

Good luck. Wishing you the best. 

This isn't the end and it can sometimes get worse before it gets better, but looking for the answer in someone else isn't a solution."

59,100%. If it wasn't this it would be another made up issue.
60,None of that is acceptable.
61,clean it out after he uses it. I don't understand why it has to be an issue with them. My parents have a cat that is dying from liver failure. They wish his messy litter box was his only problem.  I
62,"omg, i am LITERALLY watching parks and rec right now. But thank you for your advice, as im watching parks and rec, Ron became my role model, i just want to avoid all the Tammies, you know"
63,"I told my parents just now a little of what you said that it's not nice to rehome him for something like that they agreed to and they said they spend hundreds on a cat therapist for the first cat and lots of money to get the carpets replaced and that if they didn't care about this cat they wouldn't have spent so much money on his vet bills and they didn't agree to smell cat shit every day. 

They told me that he goes to the only board certified vet in the city (I thought all vets were certified) and that it costs them thousands each visit and since it means so little to me I'll now have to pay them back for the vet costs. They said paying them back won't be anything at all to me since when they did it it meant they didn't care about him and it just a small thing anyway.

I can't afford the vet bills! They said that I can maybe sell my car or the cat can give me a loan.

They told me that I was ungrateful and didn't appreciate anything and they said they're taking him first thing in the morning to the shelter.

This isn't fair at all and I'm going to ask my uncle and my aunts if they can temporarily keep the cat until this is better."
64,Opening the relationship isn’t the answer. I coach people on how to open their relationships for a living and the first requirement is you have to have a stable relationship and trust to begin with. See the therapist and see if she would be willing to attend couples therapy. Depression sucks my friend and I hope you focus your energy on that self care as a priority.
65,"Ask yourself very seriously why you want to stay with him. When you put up with bad treatment, you get more and more of it. You need a relationship with a man who treats you the way HE would like to be treated."
66,"She is WAY overstepping even after you told her it was inappropriate the first time. Jeeze. I don't think it's an overreaction to block her number.


She may realize how badly she fucked up after some point and if it were me I'd also be open to her reaching out and apologizing for having bet head up her ass one day. If she 100% owns how rude and out of like that was and apologizes like a lot and promises not to say anything like that again then I'd forgive her and stay her friend but that's me and you're totally justified to drop her arthritis no matter what."
67,[removed]
68,"Either you both agree you're 'seeing each other' which is much less of a commitment than 'boyfriend/girlfriend' or you stop seeing each other because he's just not that into you.

It's probably reasonable of him to hesitate if he's leaving and your relationship is going to be cut off soon.

If you can enjoy the moment, label it as 'seeing him' aka 'hi, this is John, I've been seeing him for a few weeks -- if you can't, let him free."
69,"You’re boyfriend is a dink. Wait.. what’s the question on this letter? Oh, what do I think? I think he’s a dink

What does your attractiveness have to do with future plans? Is he just dating you holding out hope that some hotter chick will come along? 

I’d bet he’s a 6 at best too. That’s probably the worst part. You’re 24. You go find someone who’s nice and wants to be with you because he likes ALL of you."
70,"I was glad to see your added note about going no-contact. It might help you to do a net search on ""setting boundaries with a parent."" It's a really common problem and if you read a bit it might help to know how many people share your difficult situation. Also, you might very well realize that being reasonable and consistent with boundaries might not ever be possible with your mom. The best you can do is control your own behavior to make things better for yourself. I really wish you well."
71,"NTA - omg, run away from this “man” as fast as you can."
72,"You don't need his permission. If you leave and he breaks up with you because of it, then that's his choice. Do what's right for you."
73,"&gt;I think I love my gf unconditionally 

I stopped reading after this."
74,"I love cats, I wait on my cats and the household cats hand and foot. and even I think you are being a little oversensitive.  If your boyfriend physically hurts the cat the. dump his ass. But the bf sounds pretty normal to me."
75,"Please do not share details of something so personal. This information isn't yours to divulge. Respect your partner's privacy. If she wants to tell them, she will. If you'd really like to give your friends and family a heads up, you could say ""she's excited but also nervous about meeting new people,"" as a way to let them know to be accepting of her."
76,"She's a person, not an investment bond. It's great that you supported her and that she's a happier and stronger person now. That doesn't mean that she owes you a relationship. 

If she's not happy with who you are, and it sounds like she isn't, then it looks from here like this relationship has run its course. 

Next time, look for someone you think is already great and who doesn't want to change you either."
77,Just throw away the whole boyfriend at this point
78,"&gt;How can I handle this situation? No matter what choice I make, it seems like there is at least one person that suffers.

You are a person. You are one of the people in this situation. *You do not deserve to suffer!* So my vote is for the choice that has the least suffering for you! 

Do not move in with this guy. It sounds like a terrible choice in almost every meaningful way.

Break up with this guy. He doesn't like your pets, and your post is a parade of red flags that would do Communist China proud. 

Realize that the three decisions here (re-home pets, move in with this guy, keep dating this guy or break up) are mostly *independent of each other*.

If you choose to re-home your pets to have more housing options, that does **not** obligate you to move in with this guy, or even keep dating him. 

If you decide to keep dating this guy, that does **not** obligate you to re-home your pets or move in with him."
79,"It is not your responsibility to fix your parents marriage or handle their finances, being that they are adults who are capable of doing it on their own. As others have said, your dad can't just turn over shit overnight. I feel like both your parents are trying to manipulate you but with different tactics: your dad with threats and your mom with victimhood. 

You don't live with them, thank goodness. Lend your mom a sympathetic listening ear but whatever you do DO NOT fix shit for her. And don't move back home."
80,"Oh that's all gone  for good. he made it over to her, he prob doesnt have a legal case at all"
81,"Sounds like you don't know anything whatsoever about psychology / human behavior. No point in me trying to explain it to you. Intolerance and ignorance are every bit as unappealing as OPs BFs ""personality"" ... there is almost always a reason for someone's CHRONIC behavior, especially like OP described. 

That being said, I still think she needs to leave. But all the ""he's an asshole"" commenters probably barely graduated HS, but let's leave my word vomit opinion here! Lol and comparing a grown adults behavior with a child is just well word vomit...

 Leave psychology to those who actually understand it."
82,"The reason I trust this one is because she is different from the others. 

I’m not perfect. The thought of leaving my friends and family and hometown of 22 years is terrifying to me. I guess I let that determine where the relationship would go. Probably shouldn’t have done that, but I realize my poor judgement. After my last couple relationships I focused on being a lot more independent and perhaps that got in the way. Hence, why I’m trying to correct that mistake because I do believe I made one"
83,What in the world. That’s not a very good thing to say. &amp; then you ask for clarification &amp; she says that? I would talk to her in person about how she feels about the relationship. Don’t waste your time on someone who doesn’t appreciate it.
84,"I know your gf, shes a cheater."
85,"&gt;  I am always walking on eggshells around him as he can go from 0 - 100 in about 2 seconds flat. He has a very short fuse and lets his imagination get the best of him, getting mad at me for things he THINKS to be true (that aren't true) and not giving me the chance to explain my point of view.

I don't even need to go past the second paragraph. You are only doing yourself and especially your child a disservice by staying in this relationship."
86,interesting. I assumed she was stealing
87,"Sure,  I was just trying to offer a possible perspective of might be going on in her head."
88,Wow. Thank you so much. I'd love to talk to you more about this if you're willing to PM me.
89,Your first paragraph was a punch in the gut. Have you been spying on me? Because you know exactly what's going on. Please feel free to PM me if you'd like to talk.
90,Your answers to 1 and 3 seem to contradict lol
91,"I don't know the definition of a Nazi? He didn't dress up in a Nazi uniform or  attend Nazi meetings or anything but I know he approved of the guy. Thing is, she says she hates her dad and she doesn't agree with his views so it's not like SHE is a Nazi, but I can imagine she has some bigotry ingrained into her because of him."
92,Sounds like you have more pressing personal issues to deal with than getting into a relationship
93,everything has been said... But let me throw in another voice... Please leave. I hope you do. :(
94,Well it's mainly extreme right-wing politics that support racism so I guess its a case of 'where is the line drawn?'. Right-wingers tend to want to conserve the country as much as possible and if that is taken to the extreme is basically saying only natives should live here.
95,"Oh yes, he'll never see that. I don't think he has any legal right to it even, since he made it over to her"
96,Don't share an apartment together.  You have only spent 2.5 weeks together.  Don't rush it.
97,Don’t (shit) mess up your good work situation because that’s where you (eat) make your money to live.
98,"She likes you. Also it sounds like you're doing things that would indicate you're together anyway, so that's why people are asking."
99,"They are just trying to make you come home to control you and marry you off again. I sincerely doubt a single word of what they’re telling you is true. Why would your coming home suddenly make them able to support a big house, car, bills, etc.?  It’s a trick.  

Go back to your apt.  Tell your mom to see a divorce lawyer.  Tell your brother you can’t pay their mortgage and your lease at the sane time.  Then cut off contact with them for a week. See what happens then. I bet dad comes back."
100,[removed]
101,"I say she should really think about what she wants, get the pros and cons down, think about what would happen if she stayed with her parents or stayed with her boyfriend. That's what I did when making my decision and it helped me figure things out. It's all in the plans you make in situations like this."
102,"1000% could be. I'm known to over analyze things. Rather then ""annoy"" her more I thought I'd ask for other opinions first. Thanks for the answer"
103,"You’ll probably be making 20% more but you’ll be paying 20% more for living in the city. Trust me, I live in a big city"
104,"Just curious... what role is your boyfriend playing in trying to fix this mistaken opinion she has of you? What role did he have in establishing it? To what degree has he let her believe this, to what extent has he challenged her, and to what degree is he wanting to defend you because you're on his team and someone important to him?

If he's not standing up with you, for you, if he's okay with his mom saying unfair things about you, if he's okay with you being unhappy with this because it doesn't matter to him that you're happy or unhappy, I'd be very concerned about his priorities and where your happiness fits in it."
105,"Is the rumor true tho? I mean, even unintentionally so?"
106,"Have you even thought about the timeline here? Your dad on Monday contacted the bank and a lawyer, was able to get bank approval and your mother's agreement and then get all the paperwork done in two days? LOL never. The bank would never take his name off a mortgage unless your mother refinanced it in her name. She couldn't do that without adequate income and never ever would it happen that fast.

You are being played."
107,"how often could this possibly happen? weird that this is an issue.

also why don't you just do the correction?"
108,If you do this you are going to look back ten years from now and really regret throwing away pets and giving up independence for a weirdo older man.
109,"""Now open your textbooks.  Woops, I dropped my monster condom, that I use for my magnum dong"""
110,"&gt;I just saw that brother is 23. IDK why, I must have skipped over that part but I thought he was an actual child. Or at least a minor. Him also being an adult makes this whole thing even more bizarre. You two are 23 and 25 crying and getting hysterical over your parents' obvious manipulations and mind-games. 

I can only imagine that growing up with parents this insane might skew your sense of what is normal and what is not. My parents are nowhere near as dramatic as this but they get allllll worked up and stressed out when even the smallest things go awry, and now at 26 I'm seeing MYSELF do it and I'm working towards trying to ""undo"" how they basically raised me to react to stress. When I read stories on here that are more extreme I definitely feel empathy for people like OP who are just so used to being treated/manipulated like this by family. 

I think what OP needs reality checks from commenters about how not-normal all of this is, and specifically how it's literally all a game her dad's playing to get her to come back. You did a great job of outlining specifically why the story has a bunch of holes and physically isn't possible. Thank you for writing it up in a straight forward way for her."
111,"Yeah a department within our company all but collapsed after two coworkers started dating, things turned sour (*very* sour), and the aftermath was splayed out to all the customers and staff for months"
112,"Talk to him! Relationships don't work without communication. Try this: ""you seem kind of sad, what's wrong?""

But also - what if it is about his ex? Be thinking about what that means to you personally in the relationship."
113,"Dude, she decided that you guys didn't have the same priorities in life and didn't want to waste her time with you anymore. She was free to do that and went through with it. I'm sure that was a difficult decision for her to make as well, but she didn't want to waste anymore time or energy on someone she didn't see a future with. 

Your ex owes you nothing. The relationship is done and no, you don't deserve a second chance. Be grateful if you get one. It took her literally ending the relationship for you to get your head on straight. Break ups suck, I'm sure it sucked for her, and my guess is she's wondering if she's going to have to go through it again because you're going to flip-flop again. 

You are the one who decided to change their mind after the fact and try and get back together with her, not her. She was fine with accepting the break up and moving on with life. You're the one that flip-flopped and initiated contact again instead of letting it be and move on. So while she's been consistent, you're the one saying you've changed. Why should she trust that the change of heart you've had is for real and not just you lashing out because you're scared of being alone?"
114,What a loser. Dump this chump.
115,Don't make the same mistake I did. I moved in with my BF 7 years ago and while it has been great I've let time slip away and I never got to do the things I wanted to do when I was younger.
116,"thank you for making the joke I wanted to make

much easier this way"
117,"&gt; I recently got out of an incredibly toxic relationship

You're still in one. This guy is manipulative and abusive. Ditch him, don't EVER get rid of your pets for anyone."
118,"Hi. I'm going to suggest that you contact a domestic violence support organization. They can provide you with emotional support that you need right now and help you work through your feelings. And, unlike randos on reddit, they won't be all tough love. And they can connect you with other women who have been where you are and left successfully. You can't put links in this sub, but the National Domestic Violence Helpline is good place to start. You can find the sit by googling the name. 

Also, please pick up a copy of Why Does He Do that by Lundy Bancroft. It explains why abusers act the way they do and why you, by yourself, can't change him. Lundy also has videos on youtube. And if you google the title and ""pdf"" you can find a pdf copy."
119,"1. Dump her. 

2. Write to the companies and explain it was fraudulent. 

3. This is identity theft. I'd be half tempted to call the cops."
120,"You're talking like you're still in a relationship with this woman OP. News flash: you aren't and there is no guarantee that she will want to get back with you. It literally took her to break up with you for you to realize that, no, being with her is actually want you want. There is no reason for her to trust that she won't have to go through something similar again in the future. Break ups suck and your flip-flop here leaves you untrustworthy. Your inability to give her space when she asked for space is even less reason to trust you at this point.

Leave your ex alone and start moving on dude. The situation is out of your control now and there's nothing you can do about it. Expect the worst so you can be ready for it if that is what happened. Things have changed and this isn't a relationship anymore. You need to stop thinking about this as if you're still together and be ready for the fact that she may not want to give you another chance."
121,"The irony in your brother telling you to let it go while doing nothing but making it worse himself is killing me. It sounds like hes projecting  and honestly with people like that (people who cant accept they truly did something wrong, apologizing to your friend was not a genuine apology but a way to make you out to be the bad guy) its not even worth trying to get an apology. He is too far in denial to ever admit he did something wrong. Your brother sounds like a raging narcissist tbh. Good luck to you."
122,"Yep, in you help yourself and invest in yourself, work and relationships and family just become that much easier to manage. If you bring your angst and self-doubt into those things, it just makes them worse.

FWIW, I've got anxiety and I had a pretty stressful spring and summer this year (working full time, finally graduated with my masters, wife and two young kids, canceled travel due to sickness, then international and domestic travel back to back, my grandpa and an uncle passed away, my dad's declining health) and even though I was super busy with all of that seeing my therapist helped quite a bit. One thing that helped me was seeing some light at the end of the tunnel, at least with some of those things, and to also appreciate the moment, the ""now"" when you're in the middle of what seems to be like a life hurricane."
123," &gt;And it would not kill you to say I love you before I go to sleep.

I audibly gasped when I read that. Who says that to someone who just lost a family member to suicide? A narcissist, that's who. She has no empathy or compassion, or even a shred of tact, because the only feelings in the world that matter are her own. 

I'm so sorry you're going through all this now, and I don't even know you."
124,I think that a threat is attention and he is desperate for OP's attention. He doesn't deserve ANY attention.
125,"All of my friends not in this friend group have moved away. This is only my second year living in this state and I guess I was partially concerned that my roommates/new friends would choose him over me and I'd be alone again, but I see that's no reason to stay in a relationship that I'm not happy in."

127,"I'd go the opposite from the other advice...if you're going to try it, go for it before you get married.  See how it goes after that.  Easier to call off a wedding than a marriage.  Especially if you plan on having kids along the way..."
128,"You seem to have reflected very little, instead being pulled around by your feelings that this isn’t right. 

First: it’s always harder to move in to someone’s existing home. Best to make a home together. 

Second: you don’t outline “wanting to build our lives together” or “wanting to spend more day to day time with each other” as reasons for the move. Why would you have been so short sighted as to base this on finances and commute?? 

I hear someone who likes to position their life like it’s happening at them. But it isnt; you’ve made choices based on very little self reflection. And you owe your partner better answers than what you give here. 

Do you want to be with her?

Do you want to build a shared home?

Do you see any benefit to staying? 

Or are you checked out? 

Either way take some ownership and recognize you owe both her and yourself some actual reflection beyond “doesn’t feel right”. And maybe some action to combat those feelings of being a guest."
129,"That seems like a really weird rumor to spread. If you are working shifts, it stands to reason that everyone will be “following their coworkers” out to the parking lot every day.

UHHH is this a joke or is her father a literal Nazi? 

Right-wing politics are one thing, and while I disagree with many right-wing stances I also understand that it is *possible* to support some of these political stances *without* being personally bigoted - but if she's driven by a viewpoint that originates from pro-Nazi sentiments, that *requires* personal bigotry."

137,"I was in a similar situation in grad school. The most important thing is to not change your schedule to accommodate someone else. If you're busy, act like it. Don't answer the door when she knocks, only respond to texts when necessary, etc. If she asks when you're coming back, say you don't know because you're busy and have a lot to do. Take down your schedule from the fridge because all you're doing is letting her know when it's a good time to bother you. Every time she asks to hang out, reiterate that you're busy and she might be able to make friends by joining some clubs. It's not mean to make it clear that you don't have time to hang out with her. At some point you're just leading her on by making it seem like it's possible you might become friends in the future. You can be more explicit as well, but in my experience it's kindest to just lead by example."
138,"&gt;If they just wanted to filch some cash they would be likely to be LESS controlling and exact, so it would be easier to miss.

Exactly. If it was just about skimming from the account, they'd be encouraging the boyfriend to spend on whatever. If he's buying what he wants when he wants, he's less likely to notice the odd $100ish disappearing every now and again, and if he does it's less likely for him to assume it's been stolen and more likely to just assume he spent it. 

If they were ultra strict he'd know he didn't spend it (because they wouldn't let him), and he'd be able to confront them for theft."

I think adding in a journaling component would be a cool idea e.g. writing about a favorite/unique/particularly pleasurable memory that stands out from your relationship. Then you can share and reflect on how you can create similar feelings foonf forward. 

I hope you post a follow-up (maybe on r/marriage?) about how it goes."
144,"Okay, I'm going to tell you about an experience of mine that is NOT the norm but I feel it might be useful.

I too understand that things are just not that simple when in love. I was in a relationship where we were absolutely in love, so right for each other, felt i had found my soul mate. There were no red flags really except occasionally when he would drink too much. One time, ONE TIME, we got in a bad argument while drunk (i was tipsy, he was near black out) and he prevented me from leaving the apartment. 

It was frightening. I felt like I had no control. I managed to get out, literally ran away. 

I didn't know what to do, couldn't confide in our mutual friends and wasn't on Reddit at the time. I knew people would say to leave him and I didn't want to, even though I was really shook.

We spoke the next day. He didn't remember anything! Vague recollection that we argued. We met up. I told him in great detail everything that had happened. He was horrified at his own behavior and immediately apologized profusely. He begged for another chance. I said I would continue the relationship if he didn't drink again. He didn't like it and tried to bargain but I held firm. Nothing like that ever happened again and he (almost entirely) held true to the promise not to drink. The relationship ended for other reasons and I never told anyone what happened. 

People are fallible. Humans can be psychological messes. However, if that human being has no interest on working on themself, there's nothing you can do to make them do so. 

You need to ask yourself:
1) does my bf have my best interest at heart?
2) does he feel bad when he makes a mistake?
3) is he working on improving his own issues?

The issue is not so much his behavior, but the repetition of it with no remorse. 

Good luck."

146,"step one, change direct deposit

step two, hopefully have agreement in writing but by putting his money in her account, it's now her money"
147,You're expecting too much. Have you never had a tough job? Why must he constantly ask about you to make you feel secure?
148,"Doesn’t sound like he needs to move. Just shift his commute directionally. 

&gt; making about 20% less than I could if I drove the same distance in another direction"
149,Cause then I'll be the loser of my group of friends if they see me with an ugly fat girl and I'll be humiliated and embarrassed
150,"Yeah, we’ve been discussing it for a while now and both understand the boundaries we’re both comfortable with. I think because I didn’t feel like it was a normal feeling, I’ve felt weird about it."

156,"I get what you're saying, but I feel like another person's wedding is really not a great time to test those waters."
157,You can't really have a healthy relationship with someone that you can't communicate your issues with.
158,"Sometimes, the simplest things are the most affective. Everything you've listed above sounds excellent, but having bullet points doesn't scream intimacy to me. Does your wife love schedules and itineraries?

I wouldn't over organize your time; cook a meal, talk about things in bed, fuck a lot, sleep in, go for a hike, find some beautiful scenery around where you're staying for a picnic. Just enjoy each other. You can guide the easy enjoyment without having bullet points - let the conversation flow naturally. If you'd like to illustrate that you have planned and put thought into things, suggest X, Y or Z activities and decide how you feel day of.

You're young parents, you're exhausted. I hope you have an excellent time, and having things be quiet, simple, might be best."

Not exactly.    
Thanks for your comment though. It is giving me a lot to reflect on.  I think we have all of the pillars but not all the time, if that's possible.  There are scenarios where he doesn't respect me and scenarios where I don't trust him."
162,[removed]
163,"I see a mix of 2 of my ex’s. One I left a couple years ago (he also literally threw my clothes into a toilet when I was trying to leave). And one that broke up with ME in February a month after my dad died because “I had a week to grieve and needed to get on with life” and “my dad was a loser so I shouldn’t even be upset” .... 

I see a lot of similarities in the walking on eggshells and the temper and oh god so much of this. Like you, I have a hard time leaving these situations. I know how trapped a person can feel. You are your own prison, much like I am mine. Logic says leave but the crushing anxiety of walking away keeps you there. 

In the months since my recent breakup, it’s been a rollercoaster. I couldn’t even eat for weeks I was so emotionally fucked up. I felt so so alone. I took to YouTube and found Coach Craig Kenneth. I started out wanting to win my ex back. But I gained a lot of knowledge on relationships and why I am the way I am. Turns out I have an anxious attachment style, explained so much about me. 

Looking back, I am better off not being with these guys. Once you get past the initial shock and horror of being alone, you get to reflect on the horrors you were living. My more recent ex was not quite as abusive as the one before, he never got violent. But all the emotional abuse left me feeling completely depleted in the end. I’m working to rebuild that now. 

Time, space, supportive friends, counselling, medication, and a lot of introspection and research on my own psychology have been helping me so much. 

I have my bad days where I think I miss him, then I read a post like this and see the similarities and how commenters react to the behaviour and I’m reminded “Oh right, yeah, that was kinda fucked up.” 

I’m still healing. Each day that passes I appreciate more and more that I am free to just be me. No one is breathing down my neck. And as I tackle my own internal struggles (which let’s be honest are the reasons we stay in situations like this) I am feeling stronger and more whole all the time. 

You know what you need to do. I promise there is light on the other side. It will be hard, but isn’t it hard being WITH him too? You and your kiddo deserve better. All the best."
164,"Agreed. It can also come off as a guilty mind. If someone started a rumour you knew definitely wasn't true, you wouldn't think twice about it."
165,"If it's a dinner date there will be conversation... he could ask how her first few weeks have gone... telling stories.. he could tell her how, in his first few weeks,  he had to go to HR about a creepy rumor, and that HR cleared him but he thinks it still pops up from time to time.   Just don't make a big deal of it."

No relationship is perfect and they are hard so why should I quit if I found a possible solution? I am attempting to fight for something good as opposed to letting it die. Why is this bad? I have not been overbearing to her and sent a measly letter that clearly defined how I felt and a sign of commitment. Now listen, nobody wants to be alone. But I’m not treating her as just another body to keep my company. I have friends and family for that consistent interaction. But she is important to me and worth fighting for, so for the love of Christ try to at least find something not positive. Like even if it does go downhill from here and doesn’t work out, I don’t need someone to completely shit on my decision making and efforts"
172,And what about my other question?
173,"luckily I start my new university course next week, so this was the last month of free time I had available before that begins. Hence, I *really* wanted to make the most of this time before things got hectic.. unfortunately this month was pretty much wasted in terms of time spent together.. it is what it is though. I already go to the gym but I can imagine once I start my course, we'll be in the same boat and our relationship will really be put to the test then."
174,"What you should not do is have children with him. People will tell you it's wrong to lose interest in someone because of their weight, but it happens all the time. It's possible your relationship wasn't strong enough even when he was slim, and his weight gain is just one more thing.Please don't ignore your misgivings."
175,There’s a book called “Why Does He Do That - Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men” by Lundy Bancroft. There are a number of websites that have a  free copy of the book. I think it will be illuminating.
176,"Anecdotally, look into taking zinc and selenium supplements with your antidepressants. It helped me have a better sex drive when using antidepressants."
177,Everyone else has already hit the nail on the head - this is another toxic relationship. Do not get rid of your pets if you are able to financially support yourself and them. I also rely on my dog for my mental health. How much time is in your current lease? Could you find a roommate and move into a two-bedroom for about 1400-1600? It would be cheaper and you would still have some private space.
178,Ask for camera footage?
179,I have no issue with BYOB by the way. That makes sense
180,Seconded by this ginger as well.
181,My first question to her would have been WHY are you in my garbage can? 2nd question is how is this any of your business? 3rd question when are you leaving?
182,"Oh wow, this sounds like a nightmare. What you and your husband do is up to you two. My girlfriend of 7 year and I have been using condoms the entire time. Originally it was because the pill really messed with her chronic migraines and was s nightmare, now we just keep using them because it's easier and less damaging than any other type of birth control. 

Your husband still feels things during sex, that's just s stupid story men say to avoid using the condom. Bont buy into it, you do you."
183,"she'll enjoy her bad choices in time.

my wife and I don't have kids and don't want them.

we've just bought our third luxury-class car, and thinking of taking a second vacation to Hawaii this year instead of just one.

""joys of raising a child"" my ass, I'll take the cash.  :)   ;)"
184,"I would let this go. You will never get money out of these two, but I would re-evaluate the friendship. The honorable thing would be for them to admit to the damage and offer to pay.  But since they didn't, I would put the friendship on the back burner...meaning you can still maintain a superficial friendship (almost AS IF they are acquaintances rather than friends) because you likely will see them again as you are probably in the same social circle.  Just don't ever count on them to really have your back."
185,"While I agree with you, understand how much this post is filtered through impulsive emotions. Given what we've been through, I don't care who she fucks; I just want her to want to fuck me. The rest of the marriage is really good. The sex has sucked, but mostly because of issues we are individually bringing into the bedroom. We're both seeking individual counseling and the safety of getting some sexual conquest we never got the opportunity to before ""settling down"" (if you can call it that)

It is risky, but I also know if we don't try, as far as my wife is concerned, the future of this is questionable. I'm a Taoist, so I'm just going to see how this plays out. Worst case scenario, this marriage is over and I pen my generations seminal divorce rock record. I can hear the gated drums now..."
186,"Good girl/ bad girl sounds weird and creepy.

She’s young and she either made a crappy mistake and has remorse OR she doesn’t have remorse and thinks she can do what she wants. It depends which one she is showing ?"
187,Why are you ok with fighting a lot?   Sounds exhausting.
188,"Take it as a learning experience and don't let it happen again. It's a shitty thing to do, and you're both hurting afterwards so it is nowhere close to worth it. 

Respect your GFs wishes and let the ball be in her court. If she wants space, don't keep running to her for an apology. If she wants to work things out, be open and let her talk about it to you as many times as she wants."
189,"I get this all the time because of my looks and fitness. I also hate being accused of bragging. No clue how to deal with it short of taking a weapon to my face and getting fat though.

Pity because I clicked with this women recently and enjoyed having a friend. Then she tried to get flirty and was like, really?"
190,"Ok. A few things:

1. You do not have to check what's inside your rubbish bin.

2. You do not have to explain yourself to anyone. Yep, anyone.

3. Your choice of birth control is yours and yours alone.

4. Ffs, please get rid of this Anne. If she is a respectful friend, she would understand the definition of the word boundary. 

5. Please get new, cooler friends. 

6. Keep using condoms if you're comfortable with it."
191,"Neither of us are religious and she pays for herself. 

But yes you're right my happiness is important. Time will tell, I think I want to give her a little longer"
192,"Apparently this man has a *face tattoo*, so really his opinions on literally everything are just irrelevant at this point anyway"
193,Exactly. We all should do what makes us feel the most safe and comfortable.
194,imma try this i just hope i wont be coin flippin for 5 hours straight
195,IT IS.
196,"you sound like you might be codependent. it happens to people who have experienced trauma, we fawn for love and place our validity on caring for other things- 
i’ve been in the same situation. i used to have a LOT of animals. i could cope with it at the time but looking back i would have had a lot more opportunities for living situations if i hadn’t.

look at it this way- you move in with your boyfriend, and you take your animals, which he resents already anyway. things get shitty between you. you now have to find a way out, but you also have to find a way out as well as find a space for your animals too.

you’ve already expressed the only reason moving in with your boyfriend would be to save money. not because you want to live with him and his roommates for the fun of it. i get that more money is an attractive option but it’s not the only option. and if it is the only option it comes with a price of rehoming some of your animals. 

write a list of pros and cons to living with this guy at his place, and what options you will have if it doesn’t work out (can you sublet your apartment for a while so you could take t back if necessary?) and if the cons are too high just don’t make he change and find another way to afford your lifestyle."
197,So you expect the host to foot the bill?
198,"That's an adult party, you bring shit over and leave behind whatever you don't eat or drink. It's sad that it even has to be asked for people to bring stuff but kudos to her for making it known. I have a few friends that mooch all the time, it's annoying."
199,uhhhh that's how adult parties work. welcome to the world
200,"Easy kid... sounding pretty defensive there, guess I struck a nerve. How about this, the money she has it how she spends her money is none of your damn business. Also every damn woman that wears heels complains stop nit picking and judging the lady"
201,"Well, in that case I'd say take it to HR. You've done all that you reasonably can before escalating it to them."
202,"The rent is free for a REASON! Because it's a super lousy situation! You get what you pay for, OP."
203,That's what confused me most. Ah very good to know for the future then!
204,she definitely dodged a bullet

206,Welcome to being an adult. Don't show up empty handed.
207,"She sounds like a perpetual victim. 
I think as long as she doesn't ask you for money, then there's no harm. Unless she shows herself to be violent or toxic toward her kid or you or your partner.... I'd leave it alone. 
She is probably just a selfish weirdo."
208,Your pets will always be with you and love you. Your guy...who knows? Why do you want to move in with him if it sounds like you would have to give up almost all your stuff? Get a roommate who is an animal lover and then you might have a free pet-sitter in the future.
209,Leave him OP. Get a nice roommate and stay away from men like him for the rest of your life. He’s toxic and terrible.
210,"Yes, these are things she has listed as still good things to do (her suggestions). Along with back rubs, foot rubs, couch cuddles, fairly usually stuff."
211,I don’t believe there is security footage. There was an eye witness account of OP’s Friend/Her BF being there/holding the broken shelf. OP gave them photos of her friend which the employee confirmed were the people she saw.
212,It's almost like it's none of your fucking business.
213,"All his reasons are for his benefit, not yours (you or both of you.) It sounds like he’s found a meal ticket and can’t wait to take more advantage of you. Seriously, why waste more time to observe and see if he’ll eventually grow up. He’s had enough time to do so. Cut your losses and so that you can meet someone who’s worthy of you."
214,Then your next step is therapy because she's being ridiculous.
215,"Nope. Just nope. Nope nope nope, and then some more nope."
216,thats a good point. it is what it is now. ill just remember it as a fun night and thats it
217,What is the principle? You’re acting like a child.
218,the national domestic abuse hotline's website has a lot of good information about abusive relationships and healthy relationship. you can also call the hotline and speak to a counselor 24/7.
219,"Anne is beyond rude and inappropriate. You asked that she stop, she escalated to her own fiance'. I would cut her off, she is not a good friend or good person."
220,So true! And also weird to be commenting on someone else’s trash!
221,"Doesn't like the bearded dragon because you purchased her when in a different relationship..... BIG red flag, NOT normal. Oh God he's ten years older than you and criticising you every day? Maybe you don't have anyone around you to tell you this and you need to hear it from someone so I'm telling you now, that's not healthy."
222,"We did, I updated the post and made a new one"
223,[removed]
224,"Ah yes, the ol' 33-year-old-who-can't-find-anyone-his-age-to-date situation.

Listen to everyone here: you're in another toxic relationship. Anyone who tells you your parents don't love you (gaslighting), that your pets aren't important (no concern for your mental health), and controls you in ""domestic situations"" (this will change to ""all situations"") is not worth keeping around, let alone moving in with. 

Get out."
225,"She wants good snacks at her parties without having to foot the bill all the time.

Welcome to adulthood."
226,"Perhaps you’re the reason she sends an invite like that. To make it clear that it’s expected. Besides, when it isn’t made clear, people just bring an assload of beer and nothing else. She’s creating a better party environment for everyone. Would it really kill you to grab some chips and salsa or volunteer to order some pizza? Jesus."
227,Thanks so much for your reply - I think you described what I’m feeling pretty dead on and I appreciate the time you took to share your thoughts. It definitely feels toxic with no resolution except cutting back my interaction with her.
228,"Is it possible she has been assaulted? Sometimes people do drugs as a means of coping, even if they wouldn’t otherwise. She definitely sounds like something is wrong with her mental health, or some sort of hormonal/neurological imbalance. If she’s not like this at all until lately, *something* has happened to her, emotionally/mentally/physically. People do not become like this for no reason. There is something wrong."
229,"Ummm....you're 28.  Stop acting like you're 12.  They didn't betray you, they didn't upstage you, they weren't inconsiderate, they weren't disloyal and they weren't selfish.  Would it have been nice if they told you?  Sure...but you didn't get shotgun on the dog just because you've ""wanted one foreverssssss""."
230,How does the pill affect lactose intolerance?
231,"This is my thought too. It seems sketchy that they're just informing OP that the deposit is gone, but without any repair bills."
232,"I mean, it's not the default way to invite people and I could see getting slightly turned off by it if it was a constant thing. But if you think contributing to the party someone else is hosting makes it ""uptight"", then I'd honestly believe that you're the uptight one. Especially when nobody else in your friend group seems to mind."
233,"Just leave it. It's not worth to dump so much into a relationship and not get anything back. She is possibly going through some stuff that makes her angry, jealous, or bitter. Maybe she is depressed? Who knows, but it isn't your problem.

I would send her a message and say you love her and how much she means to you. Then I would say that you get the impression she isn't into having a relationship at this point, but if she ever changes her mind in the future you will remain open to it. Then let it be. She might deny it and in response just reiterate you love her and hope to have a good relationship. Then leave it. Let her make the effort for a bit."
234,"I think you should ask him on a date, and use the word ""date."" It's not easy to carry on a relationship with a grad student because they have so little free time, but you can see how it goes. If he's hesitant, just tell him the offer is open and he can let you know. SOmetime with shy people, you don't get any signs...you just have to initiate."
235,Im not well socialized.
236,"Sure, maybe, but maybe she doesn’t want to be patient and that’s also okay. All you need to take away from this was that she did not feel like you were moving at the pace she wanted to move at, and therefore you guys were not compatible."
237,[removed]
238,"You didn’t need that whole middle part explaining why you’re using condoms. It’s your body and your choice :) 
This is pretty basic: Anne sucks. I would dump her as a friend. 
If for some reason you don’t want to, then let her know that she was extremely out of line talking to you about that and getting her husband involved and then... dump her as a friend. Sorry I can’t help myself!"
239,"Yeah no. The guy asked you get rid of family to save on rent. After 6 months. I mean this kindly, but it's seems like your taste in men is almost as bad ass my taste in women (it's horrendous). 


If it's too expensive then it's move somewhere cheaper. He said no pets for the weakest reason I've ever heard of. He didn't even make a hard no lie for a believable reason. He basically said ""cuz I don't wanna"".


There's so many toxic control issues at work here I'd travel cross country to intervene if you were my daughter. Please take all the advice about red flags here and leave him."
240,"Seriously, these ground rules should've been explained to OP way before now. Nobody liked the college kid that expected to contribute nothing to any party. It's even worse for the person her age doing it."
241,Sounds like you have too much time on your hands stalking her Facebook and analyzing her life 😂😂😂
242,Well why do you wanna continue the relationship then? If he annoys you to the point where you lash out? It must be very bad for you to react like that.
243,"Ultimately, it doesn't matter what her reasons are. She has the right to determine the level of contact with her biological mother.

I think this is largely adoption-specific. It's difficult for people who aren't adoptees to understand tht unique struggle of maintaining a relationship with people who are biologically your parents... but not your parents. It's difficult. Her desire to have special occasions be reserved for her family is perfectly understandable. It's perfectly reasonable for her not to want to have to explain to people why someone other than her mom is referring to OP as 'daughter'. She should have the right to celebrate with her family without having to constantly take into the account the feelings of her birth mother. It's complicated and difficult and unique to adoption."
244,"It's okay to ask her to stop or tell her you're uncomfortable with her acting out her feelings toward her ex this way. She should be doing this alone, or with a therapist. It's selfish of her to do it with you."
245,"Listen, Josh shouldn't contact Mark, but you are not handling this correctly by ignoring the issue entirely.  Mark's behavior is very alarming.  Print out everything he has sent you, and take that with the letter to the police.  Talk to them about what your next steps should be to stop this harassment."
246,"He calls and sends emails and letters.  It is a little too early to call him a stalker.

And even if he is a stalker - Having you BF call the stalker is still irrational.

So take your pick, point still stands."
247,"Dude, you need to start moving on now after shooting your shot. That's all I'm saying. Expect her to not want to get back with you at this point. This mentality that you need to keep on fighting no matter what is pretty toxic. You took your shot and now you need to start moving on with the assumption that she isn't coming back. Stop waiting around for something that may not happen. That's all I'm saying."
248,"You should end it because he's a loser that can't get a woman his own age, because she wouldn't put up with his shit. Why are you?"
249,"Popular girls tend to be charming 24/7...they know how to have fun on all occasions. You are young, make contact and hope for the best; most likely this will be one of many highs and lows as you mature."
250,It'll be far more valuable to let all of your mutual friends know those guys are thieves.
251,"OP's husband could use some help, but ultimatums of any kind are always a bad idea"
252,Pet ownership can’t be taken lightly. I would never even entertain the idea of giving up mine for a guy I dated for only 6 months.
253,"You need to see a psychiatrist for your depression to get both therapy and medication if necessary.  As for your relationship, I think you should end it because you don't trust him anymore and you can't have a relationship in which you don't trust each other."
254,"Keep the lines of communication open and be super clear about expectations and boundaries! Make sure B knows how much you appreciate her working to incorporate your needs and C into her life; be patient as she navigates this. Determine if one person is a primary partner. Determine if you'd be okay with B and C being friends or lovers without you present. Be open to the fact that one or both of them may change their minds at any point and you'll need to respect and deal with that if it happens.

&amp;#x200B;

Time management will be critical. TBH, the biggest reason I've observed many poly relationship scenarios not panning out long term is because of a lack of time/good time management, especially if you're a person who needs any significant amount of time alone, too. Make sure you guys talk about how many nights everyone is expecting to spend together, solo, all together v one on one.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally-- are you still going to pursue seeing other people beyond B and C, or are they fulfilling all of your needs right now? Definitely figure that out.

&amp;#x200B;

The caveat I would tell you to look out for is if B is playing the 'cool girl' in an effort to ultimately win your undivided attention. I know that sounds a little insane but I have seen it happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that... enjoy it! It's nice to read someone's post who seems  happy :)"
255,"If you give away all your pets and move in with a dude you've only dated 6 months, you will be setting yourself to be in another toxic relationship. He's already making demands for you to abandon your beloved pets and be essentially dependent on him for housing. This is a textbook way of creating a toxic environment by creating a massive power imbalance that you feel isolated in."
256,"DO NOT move in with this guy. 

Look on FB Marketplace, Craigslist etc for someone who's looking for a roommate/subletting a room in their home. Having pets will make the search harder, but not impossible, and you'll save hundreds of dollars a month."
257,"You wouldn't be the one to split friends up in this situation. The friend is responsible for his actions. He would be to blame for ruining the friendship if he continues acting like this, not you."
258,Lol I don’t think I would have enough to ask for any form of restraining order. If you saw him on the street you would never match this behavior to him. He’s this super tall but super thin guy. He legitimately only weighs 20 more pounds than me. This kid has never done anything physical in his life minus the “tons of sex” he has told me about (we never did anything more than makeout once for ten seconds because I timed it haha)
259,Don't do it.  He refuses to meet your family.  He is a control freak and he has a ton of rules when it comes to you sleeping over there.  He also wants you to ditch your pets and your life to move in with him and two other men.  It would be a disaster if you did it.
260,i think it's the other way around but not sure tbh
261,"I think you know you are not overreacting. I also think you know that the relationship has to end. 

I’m really sorry for the way he is treating you and acting. I have been through a similar relationship, and no matter what you do or say he will not change. 

If there was a phrase you could have said to make him more compassionate, understanding, sympathetic etc. you would have said it. No matter how much you explain it he will never understand and he will never be the man you deserve. 

You used the term gaslighting so you are aware that that is what he is doing. You are not crazy. He is projecting everything he does to you on to you, and turning it around like you have done those things. 

When you can’t give him your completely undivided attention because you are actually doing things for the whole family he blames you for not listening, for not being present, which is actually the way he is. 

He decides when the conversation is over, he decides when to act sympathetic, he decides when to stop punishing you. He decides all of this based on what is convenient for HIM. 

A relationship is a two way street and from what you have explained you have done a lot of compromising while he thinks that it’s his world and you just live in it. 

I know that these types of relationships are hard to leave. I know it’s easy to get confused and find yourself wondering what YOU did wrong. 

I’m telling you, you are not the problem. He is the problem. Your problems will go away if you leave the relationship while his will remain. He will continue to treat every person he is close with like this. 

Take the extra stress off of yourself and do not stand for this. You are not responsible for his actions and feelings. He is a big boy and should have already learned how to control himself. 

You should be able to say what you want and need to say without fear of a major tantrum. 

This type of relationship is extremely toxic. It’s dangerous. Not only is it mentally draining, it could become physically unsafe as he is already throwing things and yelling. 

You mention you have children, and I urge you to think about how all of this affects them. I know it may seem like it’s impossible to leave with kids involved, but many people do it. And I think you’d set a better example for your children by leaving rather than by staying in this situation. 

If he gaslights you he will gaslight them, and they will grow up and continue this cycle of generational trauma. 

You are the most important person in your life, and in your children’s lives. You were not put on this earth to endure this abuse.

You deserve compassion, respect, sympathy, unconditional love. Everything you give your children I am sure. 

I know it’s extremely hard to leave relationships like this, I stayed way too long in mine, but I promise that you’ll be much much much better off without this so called “man” in your life. 

You will not regret leaving, but you will regret staying. Please consider what i’m sure everyone else is saying and what I am saying. Get out as soon as you can. 

Also, I am sorry that you lost your mom. I just recently lost mine and I understand how you feel. The weight of grief is unlike anything else, and it is something we all must learn to carry with us. 

So, on top of learning how to navigate life with grief you are also carrying the burden of trying to fix a situation that is not in your control to fix. 

The only thing in this entire world you have control over is YOU. Which is a great relief because that means you are only responsible for you. Focus on what you can do. How YOU alone can change this situation. 

You will come to realize that leaving is your only option. You have tried to change yourself, you have tried to change his perspective, both to no avail. Meaning that there is only one thing left to try to change, your position in the situation. 

Once again, i’m so sorry you are going through this, and I wish you were not. But you have the power to change it. Take the chance."
262,just push him with your foot and see if he likes it . rude ass bf

264,I guarantee he will be thrilled...just let him know you are interested....guaranteed!
265,"Are you happy? Are the kids happy? Is he happy? 
Then it’s working. 

This is such a non-issue. Peoples opinions don’t belong in YOUR relationship."
266,"&gt;childish cunt

His words or yours?  Because that will be a big factor is how this should be handled.

But either way.  His priorities are out of order - Your happiness and well being is more important.  If, which I assume, you both are financial stable with your current situation - then I think he needs to back off.

If you are not financial stable and you choices are negatively affecting you and your husbands future, then you should probably make a logical choice instead of an emotional one.  (i.e get a better job now as opposed to the job you want)."
267,"In that case.. this is pretty low ball move. But you're better off telling your Aunt then about the whole situation. Based on your description it doesnt seem like your mom and her sister will be patching things up anytime soon... but make sure you're telling one of them the truth atleast.. sorry I don't have any other suggestions. But this is quite a difficult situation. On one hand you need help and the other you're trying to satisfy  your mother. So just realise that if things go south, you had no choice and you're in a corner and tangled in a web created by everyone else. Hopefully you get through this man!"
268,Not necessarily. Some women don't show until pretty far along.
269,"Here's how I would have done, I would have asked ""duck-cracker, the cat is in the way and I don't know how to make it move, can you please help me move the cat"".


Or have a piece of string to lure the cat away, it's not that hard... 

If my boyfriend shoved my pet out of the way like that he would be out of my life."
270,"&gt; she took it upon herself to make an account and apply for jobs using my resume ...   She feels like I should be making more money because she feels it will help us move our relationship forward quicker 

That's controlling as hell, and would be a dealbreaker for me."
271,"Why would you need to tell anyone that? I have bipolar disorder and people never would know unless I told them. People can be extremely judgemental and just straight-up stupid about bipolar disorder. 

If you had IBS is that something she needs to disclose to her family? 

Honestly it seems pretty fucking weird to me that you think her bipolar disorder is such a huge part of her and soooo important that you think you need to share your gf of 2 month's mental illness withyour family as if she has some terminal cancer. Grow up."
272,I actually can't stop loving him.
273,"People with anxiety can get triggered by all kinds of things. He stated that she has body dysmorphia. That’s a diagnosed illness, not just her feeling a little self-conscious. Your comment is dismissive and seems to display an ignorance of how mental illness works."
274,I feel so sorry for the kid if or when they find out dad knows nothing about them and mom is a lying pos.
275,"&gt;BF [33] wants me [22F]

Alarming age gap for your life stages

&gt;BF [33] wants me [22F] to give away my pets so that I can move in with him (rent free), and he refuses to move in with me.

Your boyfriend wants you to discard your family and make your dependent companion animals homeless so that you can live with him, but won't live with you so that you can keep him. 100% bet he's doing this to control and isolate you and make you dependent on him

&gt;We’ve dated seriously for maybe 6 months. 

Why would you even consider getting rid of your pets for a relationship where you've only just reached the maybe you actually know him a little mark? I'm assuming you've had your pets for longer than 6 months and that when you got them you intended to care for them for as long as you were able to provide for them. Seriously, why is this a question and not an instant boot to this guy? It's not like it's ""get rid of your pets because they have behavioral problems"", which might be reasonable, but you've still had them your entire relationship and your relationship is still ONLY SIX MONTHS LONG.

&gt;I recently got out of an incredibly toxic relationship

Open and shut case. OP, you need to be single, in therapy, rebuild your support system, and break the chain of abuse. You are in an incredibly toxic relationship and I haven't even gotten past the first three paragraphs."
276,He moved away.
277,"How he treats the cat is how he would treat you if he thought he could get away with it, IMHO.

One of the things I love best about my husband is how wonderful and nurturing he is with our animals.  We have a bunch of pets and they all just adore him; one of my favorite things is to watch them together with him because it's just so loving and great.  Find you a guy who can do THAT with your kitty!"
278,"Dont be nervous about it. If she likes you enough to go on a first date with you then she will probably doubt the rumors. Also yours is easily more harmless because following a girl to a car is often easily misunderstood. So even if you were seen in the parking lot with another coworker nothing is to say your car wasnt a little ahead. Peoples imagination tend to run wild sometimes. If you ignore the rumors and act like your normal self the rumors will go away on their own. 

If you let the rumors bother you it makes you look suspicious. I would laugh if ever it is brought up. You have to see some comedy in going to the parking lot and being mistaken for a creep. So if people pester you about it you can just shrug it off without an accountable witness or video evidence or even a police report they will seem like A holes if you dont let it get to you. Just dont let it get to you but be forward and honest if asked.

I would love to crack a joke about helping a girl to her car because I heard there was a creep. Then coming clean admitting that I dont even know how the rumor started."
279,"Wait wait wait.

What culture is your gf from? This is hugely important. In some cultures, it's expected of the child to take care of the parent at a certain again. 

Gf's mom is from another country? Does she speak the local language or even have a way to work?

There is a lot missing here."
280,Malikight is insisting that the bf is acting this way because he's mentally ill and not because of a bad personality.  You can read the comment they left me for more of their galaxy brain take on how I'm an idiot for saying assholes aren't inherently mentally ill.
281,"Even if this one incident hadn't happened, it would be bad. He has a short fuse, you're walking on eggshells a lot of the time. He mocks you, throws your stuff, and yells in your face during arguments. He's dismissive and he insults you.

He's not treating you you with respect at all. It sounds like he doesn't care about your feelings and he doesn't even like you. 

Please, please -- I know it's hard to leave after all the time together and after holding onto hope that things will get better. Giving up hope is a huge loss. But you need to show yourself the care and respect that you're never going to get from him. It will be painful, but you need to break up with him."
282,"His response to me telling him that he has to respect my rules about Marshmallow was ""fine, I just won't ever touch him again.""


He doesn't like cats to begin with. He says he ""barely tolerates"" my cat. I wish that he had simply responded with an apology and said he would do as I asked in regards to Marshmallow's treatment. 


It hurts extra because having this bond with my cat has really helped my mental health, and that doesn't seem to register for my BF at all."
283,"No, it isn't wrong to break up with him.  He doesn't appreciate or care about you at all."
284,"Your mother wants to use you to punish the relatives she's refusing to interact with. You're an adult and you need to do what feels right to you. Visiting elderly grandparents is a kindness, and shunning an aunt who's helped you hand showed faith in you is very harsh. I know you don't want your mother's anger to be directed at you, but think very carefully about your values and your future relationships with the rest of the family."
285,"Yeah, it's totally a crush.  An annoying one for sure, but you're 100% right.  Thanks for encouraging me to do the right thing.  So glad I posted - I feel better already."
286,"No, that's silly. There are plenty of reasons a condom could be missing even if one WAS missing. Maybe it fell out and dropped behind a desk. Maybe you looked earlier and one of the packages was damaged. Maybe you used one for yourself. Maybe he miscounted the first time. Treating them like a limited thing and watching their count is absolutely a huge insecurity thing."
287,"You are not in a normal relationship. A normal partner don’t go from 0 to 100 in two seconds. You are not supposed to feel like you need to walk on eggshells around your partner. 

If you pick a random guy in America as your next boyfriend, then the chances are the random guy will treat you better than your current boyfriend."
288,"I'm just laughing at the ""diddle"" part, forget the rest......lol"
289,"I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this, and I very much appreciate hearing your perspective. 

I guess my answer is that I've been clinging to the good memories so many years that they've become worn and tarnished. I tried so hard to hold on to the happy times that the sadness has completely infected them. I've spent so much energy and so many emotions trying to fix us that my tank is absolutely empty. I have nothing left to give, I have no love left at all. If he'd stepped up even two months ago, we might be in a very different situation, but unfortunately it's too late. I have often thought about how I'd feel if I saw him with someone new, and the fact that I can picture myself relieved and happy for him more than jealous and hurt was another nail in the coffin. 

If your husband treated you that way, to leave you like that, you deserve so much better, and I hope you can find peace in who you are and use the experience to create a more fulfilling life for yourself. Whether you knew it or not, if he's been feeling that way for awhile, you haven't been in a healthy relationship. Once you're in one, or maybe just becoming enough for who you are like I hope to be someday, you'll realize you're in a much better and happier life."
290,[removed]
291,I guess im the only one that thinks this is insane? You guys met 8 months ago and hes spent a lot of that time in another country and havent discussed anything serious like finances and future plans but are already planning on moving to another country for this guy and getting married?!? What is happening. Am i misunderstanding the situation?
292,"If that's what you're into, more power to you. I know of at least one friend's partner who is also into this, if that makes you feel better! But ultimately if it's something you like and it's consensual and not harming anyone, it's a-okay.

You might want to experiment with something less physical to begin with, though. Maybe you two post some naughty photos of her online and read the comments, see how that makes you feel before having her actually get with someone else?

Nothing wrong with your kink, but I've definitely heard of people for whom the actual physical act ended up being too much. I think it's easier to move past ""that time some random dudes jerked off to your photo"" than ""I saw/heard about a man putting his penis in you.""

Good luck!"
293,"Watch ""Mallrats"" together. During a particular scene, say ""well that doesn't sound so uncomfortable to me"" and he'll get the picture."
294,"When you assert your boundaries: ""you're too clingy, it's making me uncomfortable"", ""your behavior is making me doubt this marriage"", ""the 'jokes' you make are scary and gross""

The proper, responsible adult thing to do is for the other person to *acknowledge* the boundary and find ways for both of you to fit within the boundaries. He has a *repeated* pattern of ignoring your boundaries and pushing you until you're uncomfortable - but not uncomfortable enough to leave. This is an absolutely classic abuse tactic. By constantly overstepping your established boundaries and making you feel bad for having them, he's establishing that your boundaries aren't as important as his. This is a MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR issue, like red alert drop everything and get out issue.

You cannot teach him to respect your boundaries. Any adult knows what boundaries are and that compromise is the lifeblood of relationships. He is casually disrespecting you to a horrific degree and you need to break this off NOW. The longer it goes in, the more time he has to erode your self-worth and bully you (or to use the adult word: abuse you) into staying. The line ""you'll never find someone who loves you as much as me""/""it doesn't get any better than this""/ ""I'm the best thing you'll ever have"" is absolutely hallmark emotional manipulation. Get out. Surround yourself with friends and family."
295,"Cause every dude is the same right?

You like anal so everyone else does?

You live in a small world."
296,You shouldn't have married him in the first place.  Leave.
297,"When the original commenter said ""that's his personality"",  Malikight was contending that the original commentor was confused in calling the bf's behavior his personality instead of calling it mental illness."
298,"How are you monogamous if you are a swinger and was sleeping with a FWB while dating this guy?

This sounds like another emotionally abusive relationship to me.

Not sure if you should want to continue it, but if you do, you probably need to step away from the FWB and swinger friends."
299,"Sorry for the delay, I went a posting spree.

I hope you're well and I hope that things are a lot clearer than they were when we last had our reddit encounter.

People with severe depression rarely understand that people like us are just content with who they are as people. Of course it's awkward and it's unbelievable. We can't fix them and we don't want to. They are capable of doing that themselves and hopefully they'll figure it out.
After all, it's their battle.

To answer your question, I don't know if it does mean anything. Depression doesn't make you stop caring about people or the desire to make connections. It takes away the ability to do that on a more constructive matter. 

I had a good friend and lover cut me out of their life and honestly. It sucks but if it makes them feel better then maybe it's for the best.

The best you can do is assure him that you'll back off and let him know that you're going to be there for if he needs it. That's all you need to do.

I'd advice against it though, the abuse is too much."
300,"Perhaps an obvious piece of advice, but save the MDMA for the last evening of the retreat (hopefully alongside the Pleasure them) and have a good playlist picked out ahead of time and a space set for dancing together, some fuzzy blankets on the couch, and water bottles and good fruit in the fridge, and/or the LSD for the last day (I think LSD is better during the day and allows you the night ahead to connect on the shared experiences once you've sobered up).  You mentioned it has been a while before you used, and you may or may not remember how powerful and consuming those experiences can be.  Molly can also have a bit of a hangover for some people which might make it difficult to focus on much else so that is why I think it makes sense for that to go hand in hand with Pleasure theme towards the end of the retreat.  Plus it just feels so darn good to cuddle in bed together as it wears off."
301,"It took them 15 months to have sex, wouldn't guarantee anything"
302,"OP: I was in a relationship like this for years. I ended it in December. One night in May I woke up and realized that anger wasn’t in my life anymore and won’t ever be again. 
I cried for hours, relieved. 
I hope you feel this too someday. 

Please listen to yourself. You *have* reached your breaking point. Leave and get into therapy to start healing from all the rage you’ve been hurt by."
303,If you're a Kratomho you know that can be quite difficult. Lol #IAMKRATOM
304,It’s like he and his entire family are 1990’s high school students.
305,"Start by educating him about cats.

If that doesn't work, and fast, then dump him.

I mean who kicks a cat called *Marshmallow*!!!!"
306,"Well, it sounds like she is re-scripting. Not uncommon in trauma therapy, although usually guided by a therapist. 

The likelihood that she will associate you as the abuser is low. Its more like she considers you so much not an abuser she can say all the things she never got to say before."
307,"Gently moving the cat aside with your foot isn't that bad (as long as you are not kicking the cat). My cat tends to be always under foot and I have had to gently move him before to avoid stepping on him or kicking him by accident.

But his general attitude is worrying. Even the most well behaved animals will bite or scratch if you bother them too much and cats don't train very well."
308,"I definitely would tell her you've had it with her attitude and stop seeing her for awhile. See what she does, or just keep walking, it's up to you, but I would absolutely not take that shit from anyone, I don't care how much I love them. I love me more."
309,"Would you offer me an egg in this trying time? Wait, that came out wrong."
310,"Amen to this. Calling a person with a serious mental illness “psycho” is super ableist. OP isn’t much better than his brother and friends. If he allowed them to say nasty things about the ex, why would he think that suddenly they’re be respectful towards the new GF?"
311,"Wow, ok. That's actually a manipulative tactic. It's a way of punishing you for complaining.

I'm not ok with this guy.

&gt; He doesn't like cats to begin with. 

People who hate cats usually suck, IJS."
312,He should not be treating your cat that way. He is also disrespecting you by not treating your pet the way you want him to.
313,Sure hope so. Hate to think about what they're going to say about her when she goes.
314,"You are spot on about his personality. I have told him to leave me alone before, which was always reacted to as an opening for more bargaining and manipulation and message spamming, so that’s why I blocked him. 

He will absolutely go on a crusade to “save” me from Josh if he gets any kind of response, and start escalating his attempts to contact me because he’ll think I’m being abused and that’s why I won’t talk to him.

My problem now is getting Josh to understand that contact will hurt rather than help the situation."
315,"Tell her right from the get go. Tell her you understand if she doesn't want to date because of it, but you would be really disappointed because you like her. But let her know you're not going to be the least bit aggressive about dating her. If anything in her believes it, the slightest bit of persistence could push her away. It sucks that this is the case (assuming the rumor isn't true, rumors don't materialize out of thin air) but if you like her you have to treat it as if she believes the rumor and be very understanding about it. Once she sees you're not going to be aggressive/persistent about it she will probably feel safe enough to date you. 

But you really need to figure out why this rumor started. It's definitely based on something."
316,"Not shallow if you're not digging someone physically. That is IMPORTANT in a relationship.

Enjoying someone's company without sexual attraction = a friend! That's okay!

She may not want to be friends. That's okay too.

Both my partner and I have friends we made through attempts at dating that just didn't pan out. Online dating is a funny beast: you can pretty much have a good sense of whether you have things in common with someone, but not chemistry... so you can often end up kinda forcing something not right for a while because ""you have so much in common"" etc.

I'd recommend telling her that you're just not feeling a romantic connection and see if she's interested in being friends. I'd do this before things go on for too long, though-- and also before she notices. I once had to call out a guy I'd been seeing for six weeks because his behavior was weird but he kept making dates with me; he profusely apologized that he wasn't feeling a romantic vibe but did like me a lot so it was confusing for him... we did end up being friends, but I was pissed at the time that I had to bring it up instead of him."
317,This girl is so clearly scamming you for citizenship and a free place to live and it's so sad that you're not seeing it.
318,"Stop trying to date a married man.  And end any friendship that you have with him.  

Talk to your partner about anything that you feel is missing in your relationship."
319,I thought the exact same thing
320,"Your mother is hella toxic.

A relationship is a two-way street, sure you'll do things that you wouldn't otherwise do while you're in a relationship but you're not doing those things because you're pussy whipped. You do them because you enjoy making someone else happy."
321,"Oh my goodness that is incredibly inappropriate and she has way overstepped her bounds! If she wants you guys to have more money, why isn’t she looking for a better job? This is very aggressive and controlling of her and you definitely have a right to speak up about it. Also if you like your job, that’s that. Your career is yours not hers. Good lord!"
322,Get the flag back.  It is yours and your ex-friends lied to you about stealing it.
323,"&gt;We have fun when we're together and we're happy. He's my biggest cheerleader, so supportive and encouraging, and I try to be that for him. 

Stop worrying about other people's definition of normal and enjoy your life"
324,"Depends on what you guys want just because it is not the nirm doesnt make it bad.

Are you both happy and where do you want it to move shoukd be your question not whether friend A or B approves. At the end of the day you are the one in the relationship."
325,I’ve had something similar to this happen - call the police non-emergency line and have them drop by Mark’s house and tell him to stop. It worked for me.
326,"Sounds like He is uncomfortable with you and looking out for his friend, interested in either Nick or you romantically, jealous or picked up on something Nick said or does and is literally looking out for you(Sleeping around, keeping you as a side girl etc), I suggest you talk to the guy and see what his deal is."
327,"Are you undergoing therapy? Have you met your university’s career counselor?

I recommend both. A career counselor can brush up your resume, improve your interview skill and assist with job search. Make use of your university's service while you still can!

Crying everyday is not normal. You need help. There is nothing wrong with asking for mental help."
328,"No I found all of them. They were just some misplaced lol. She decided to cheat and leave after 7 years a couple months ago. because she wanted to go out and party 3-4 nights a week now, and we are both in our late 20’s... guess I dodged a bullet."
329,"It kind of depends on why they get involved.  If they agree with your cousin, then they have a right to their own opinions (as do you).  If they are uncomfortable with conflict, then it's mixed - as too much conflict can be a real concern.  If you and your cousin are both enjoying the debate, then maybe it would help to take it off line - so that the rest of your family doesn't have to stress over it.

Personally I also have some very strong opinions - that happen to be quite a bit outside of the mainstream - or at least outside of the propaganda that we see every day in the mainstream media.  Sometimes I say what I think, while trying to also respect other people's opinions, and sometimes the best I can do is to mention something small that might get someone else to think about the absurdity of what we're expected to believe.  We have to balance being right with being part of a society that promotes a lot of unfortunate ideas."
330,He sounds like a dick tbh. Your cat can’t speak for itself so you need to.
331,"Yeah tbh that was also sorta uncalled for. I don't know how they reacted to Tod about it, but it's technically the exact same crime. Maybe in the beginning the brother was miffed partially because he was the only person being called out. One person saying it could be considered teasing, two people saying it starts to look like bullying. But the person joining in might not realize that.

Or maybe the photo he posted was especially unflattering, which escalated the teasing to an actual insult."
332,"I'm not sure I'd be *casual* about it, I'd mention it made me feel weird that someone was saying that about me, but tell her she should feel free to ask the person who OP allegedly followed. Go right to the source to figure it out, but that it does bother you a bit because it goes against your character. Be matter-of-fact, open, honest and hopefully she will feel comfortable moving past it."
333,"&gt; He also lives over 1,000 miles away in another state

so did you move or did he move? how does he know your home address?"
334,She doesn't use birth control
335,"Her behavior is so heartless, I'd never be able to get passed this.  Just goddamn, it's all about her isn't it?  It takes about a year IMO for people to reveal themselves, and she has clear as day.  Dump."
336,"Boyfriend will always count condoms. He will also question where you were, who you were with, why you were late, why you wore makeup to work, why you wore nice underwear if all you were doing was going shopping.... boyfriend has a suspicious mind."
337,"Great idea, a lot of the inspiration for doing something like this came from the very inspiring relationship writers I follow on Medium.  Absolutely I'll post a follow-up.  Really appreciate everyones ideas and I think journalling could be very helpful."
338,[removed]
339,"This is one of those situations where you have to be very direct and refuse to discuss your reasons. Don’t JADE (justify, argue, defend or explain). Keep it short and simple: “Mom, I understand that you and auntie are having a disagreement, but I do not have issues with auntie so I’m not going to avoid her and this is not up for discussion”. The end. 

If she tries to guilt you, repeat like a broken record “I’m not discussing this. Asked and answered. If you don’t drop the subject, I’m leaving”."
340,"Sounds like you left one abusive relationship for another. Maybe you were too vulnerable to see it at the time but I think you do now. He may have been nice back then during your break up when you really needed it but the fact is he isn’t now. 

He’s saying bad shit about your family because he’s isolating you. He doesn’t want you to feel like you can talk to them. He’s also eleven years older than you. There may be a reason why he sought you out and that’s because you’re younger and easier to control. A woman his age may have more experience to not take any of his shit.


He’s an abusive person and you need to get out now. If you can’t find a room mate, take your cats and your lizard and go back to your home state. I don’t know your family history but explain this situation with them they may help you until you find a place of your own. Don’t give up your pets..(from one animal owner to another..they are your babies.. ) don’t give up your life for someone who is abusive and controlling. Stay with him and there will be more rules for you to abide and be criticized before you know it. You are young and deserve better than this loser."
341,"My husband is an equal partner in parenting and the household chores - I wouldn't expect or allow anything else? We're partners, I'm not his servant."
342,The more time you spend trying to get this guy to pay attention to you is time you could be spending going out and making a bunch of really amazing friends who think you're the bee's knees.
343,"Look out for marshmallow, he can't help but be a cat. Your boyfriend however can help being a dick. If you find his behaviors repulsive it's unlikely he will change his world view about animals. 

Cats are intelligent and they can learn rules and ettiquite to a degree. They don't learn it with ""discipline"" however. Positive reinforcement will go alot further than shoving, and showing a bad attitude to the cat is a good way for the cat to have a bad attitude towards the person."
344,"There is clearly something she diesnt want to discuss with you, for whatever reason. Maybe just back off a little on asking what's wrong, and give her the space to decide how\if to tell you. I tend to ask my boyfriend if we are okay when he is quiet. I know it annoys him, so have tried to not do it. But he doesnt throw temper tantrums either. This is a tough one."
345,"It's rough when you find what might be a pretty fundamental incompatibility with a partner. A lot of people view animals as less than or have outdated ideas on how to treat them. Same thing for kids.... 

My ex didn't get along with my cat at first, cat showed his displeasure by being onrey and peeing on the exes stuff. Ex never really ""got it"" but learned to treat my cat better. Anyway. Only one of them is still around, and we still get along great."
346,Cool man. I'm glad you're ok with it.
347,"That really sums it up nicely. I feel like you have to be a little bit more aware and respectful of how cats operates. Dogs are easier to train and do whatever you want - you can be in charge. With cats it is more give and take and you have to meet them at their level more. I don't think he is capable of that... a weird insight into his personality, but he generally has an attitude that his way is always the right way. It doesn't mesh well with the kind of attitude a person needs when living with a cat."
348,Bring it up right before you're about to kiss.
349,Why does 10 years matter if you are not happy now?  I mean end it - whats the point of this friendship?
350,"Can you try to phrase it in a way that maybe your current location isn't fit for a dog? My fiance and I currently live in an apartment sized condo and even though we have ample walking area and I would be home enough to care for a dog, the living space is barely livable for my cat. I think that if you put it in that context maybe she would be more understanding? A guinea pig doesn't necessarily need a large roaming space, and all that it really needs is room that fits it's cage and place to stretch out a little when you want to play with it, where as a dog needs space to make it's own on top of the space you live in. I think that if you said something about a dog needing more space than an apartment it doesn't cast shade on her but it keeps you from having a bad situation with a dog"
351,Kinda clickbait since you're not breaking up over a song..
352,"I agree, that or arguing. There is no reason she needed to go upstairs to fix her make-up, there were two bathrooms downstairs and mirrors all over the venue."

358,Who know if he does see it. If he is curious and knows it's me then he will at least see that I am not coping with this very well.
359,"Thank you so much for the advice! The time management thing is not something I have thought about much. B needs her alone time much more than either of us so at this point it has just kind of worked out that I usually see C when B needs to be alone, as I do not often need that. I appreciate your perspective on everything."
360,"I want you to record yourself saying “go ahead” to your dad,  just to see how fucking fast his house of cards collapses on itself."
361,"Dog people are not cat people. It's a wholly different way of seeing the animal-human relationship. Indeed, a wholly different way of seeing relationships period. He's authoratarian and you are peer-to-peer."
362,"I mean I definitely need to think more about it, this idea of having children has just been with me for as long as I can remember. I’m fine having a discussion about who stays home when the time comes. I’ll definitely check the articles out as well. Financially we are very different, she spends everything she gets and I save almost everything but she’s willing to let me do the investment side of our money as long as she has freedom with money which is fine. I also tend to not really care too much about money because I care so much about her that taking her out on dates or food is barely a thought for me."
363,"&gt;He keeps saying i should be a receptionist because thats what most women do and it gives good pay and benefits.

You will not be making $60k a year as a receptionist. You're unlikely to make that in an office setting without a degree and/or years of experience. 

Beyond that, your husband sounds controlling and abusive. The name calling? Not okay. He's the one being childish and selfish here. You should not have to give up your career goals just because he said so. Yes, your finances are one in the same now, but he's not discussing options with his partner, he's making demands as if you're not on his level."
364,"&gt; but I stumble every so often that I'm going to get left behind or that he does things with other people that he doesnt want to do with me, which would make me feel that 'I'm not good enough'.

What is he doing and not with you?"
365,"I'm glad your girlfriend's illness is well managed! Even if she thinks it's fine to tell your parents, I still wouldn't. People often have a very negative view of the bipolar diagnosis if they don't already have a family member or friend has it. They might not know how much medication and therapy have advanced. They may have heard bipolar disorder termed as ""manic depressive disorder"" in the past, a scary and prejudicial name. 

If she feels it would be good to let them know something about her mental health, it would be better to mention things she experiences. She sometimes gets depressed, she sometimes has a period of higher energy and activity, that sort of thing. Later, when they (and you) know her better, you can say more."
366,"So even though both of your parents are supportive, she won't be public with you because of her grandparents bigotry? Get a girl who isn't stuck in the closet and who respects you enough to show you off."
367,"I wish he had done that. I have gentle ways of dealing with this issue. I usually just relocate Marshmallow to another room, or put him in his favorite window. That distracts him long enough to get out the door with no problems.


I feel like ending the relationship over this, and because we have general communication problems, but I am in shock that I am even having this problem. I didn't think he would be unkind to my cat. He is good with dogs and they generally like him. Sometimes it seems like he thinks you can treat cats like dogs, and he just rolls his eyes if I explain that they are different animals and it doesn't work like that."
368,"I would literally just pretend he’s not there. Don’t acknowledge him at all. Try to stay around friends and out of the house as much as possible. 

Is he abusive in other ways? Neglecting you by running off in the night is not appropriate.

You may even qualify to be emancipated if he’s that bad."
369,"Dating this girl would be social suicide at your workplace. They already don’t like you (even if it’s for a false reason), so when they see you’re dating a younger new girl....yikes"
370,I'm sure he'll be nice and humble again when his over-confident investments crash.
371,This is seriously confusing to you?  Are you 12 years old?  This an adult woman *clearly* signalling to an adult man that it can be more than just a friendship.
372,Thank you for your reply. Ive been doung way better! I have actually come to terms with I believe he has NPD. Ive hern researching it for a long time and based on his actions and our relationship..i believe its the issue along with depression which goes hand in hand. Im just focusing on myself and a new plan. I have to get out of this rut and just move on. I hate being so loving at times haha but as times goes I see things more clear. Thank you so much for your kind advice! 😍 xx
373,"No worries, glad you made peace with it.
I'm just sorry it had to be this way, you do you and slayyy. 😫😫"
374,[removed]
375,"Ehhh, I don't really agree because I dated my co-worker and we've been married for 4 years now, together for a total of 8. But, we were in different departments and didn't have to actually work on a team together. I think that's the big difference. Since they work opposite shifts, I'm not sure how much of an issue it would be."
376,"Hey now, it's not like she's been expressing this to him, she's on here to work through these feelings on her own. She's allowed to feel discouraged. Pride is a big thing to overcome, and it can absolutely be discouraging to spend hours dedicated to a skill only to have someone come along and blow you out of the water in one go.

I also suspect there's a bit of an independence element to it. People in long term relationships are naturally super intertwined. It's nice to have a hobby all to yourself outside of your relationship, your own ""thing"". Mine is painting. My husband's is movies and music.

If he suddenly got an exhibit at a museum after one painting, or I got published in NY Times for a critical review of an arthouse film, we'd both probably be like, ""well fuck"". 

Of course the only answer here is to remind yourself this is for your own pleasure and satisfaction, and to be happy for the accomplishments of your SO. But sometimes just acknowledging discouragement, jealousy, and other icky feelings can help."
377,"You can't control her behaviour only your own behaviour.

If you get a dog, I'm moving out (because you aren't home enough to look after a dog)."
378,"This is an issue I struggle with. I'll be honest with you, it's not a problem that gets solved overnight or even over the course of a lifetime. It's something that you'll have to work through in all your current and future relationships, whether family, friends, or work, to see how much you're giving and how much you're getting in return. 

Let me guess, you come from a family where you were always expected to be the giver. This could mean giving up your free time and money for things you don't want to do. It could also mean not causing waves when someone is rude to you or takes your things or borrows them and destroys them. You weren't supposed to complain and were reprimanded, made fun of, or even ignored if you tried to do something for yourself or advocate for yourself. Yeah, been there, done that.

Tell the people in your life that you're overextended and that you're going to pull back a little. You're still available to hang out, but you can't give 200% anymore. And then pull back and notice if you see a change. If someone wants to have a party, don't offer to host it and provide all the food and drinks. You can host it, suggest a pot luck, and ask people to sign up to bring dishes. (You can even assign them if people aren't speaking up.) If the party doesn't happen because no one wants to help, then you have your answer for the type of people your friends are.

Another thing to do: meet new people. Find a hobby and go to meet-up groups or classes. It could be exercise (dance, rock climbing, CrossFit), artistic (painting, ceramics), or nerdy (board games). If you regularly attend, you will meet and befriend new people. Now is your chance to be the person you want to be with them -- kind but not overly giving. See the kind of people you will meet. And watch their actions, not the words. (Someone telling you ""you're my best friend"" and then breaking plans with you last minute all the time -- not a good friend).  

I'm not going to lie to you. There will be moments of loneliness. You'll end up doing a lot of things alone. But you know what? You might start to prefer doing certain things alone. (I find it freeing to travel alone and try to take at least one solo trip a year.)

It is a process, but you'll get through it. It helps to have a good therapist as a sounding board to determine if the behavior or reactions you're getting from other people is normal or selfish. And I'd suggest you do some reading on narcissists/codependents (you're a codependent if you give too much), emotional vampires, and how to set good boundaries. It might be eye-opening.

Good luck on your journey."

Great idea man go for it"
382,"I'm sorry, your dad is a childish asshole and is a terrible father. It sucks to have to see your own dad that way, but there's no other way to put it. What he's doing is disgusting and abusive and he should be ashamed to call himself a parent.

&gt;I spent the whole night worried

You don't need to worry, he's an adult who can take care of himself out there. Storming out like that after a fight is super childish and irresponsible behavior especially from a parent (as a parent you need to be able to put the well-being of your child *first* and he has put you fucking last and treated you like garbage during your whole account). I'm sorry that you have had to live with this kind of parenting, it's seriously not okay and not at all appropriate.

&gt;he'll just disappear again and maybe not come back next time

That's what he wants you to think so that he can use storming out to emotionally manipulating you into being too afraid to ever question him. He's a huge fucking jerk and a massive piece of shit for treating his own child this way. Don't let him scare you into silence.

&gt;What can/should I do about this situation.

Do you have any trusted adults in your life that you can reach out to for help? You need to put your own health above any concern you might have for your dad.

Sorry if this is not very nice about your dad. I really tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and not assume the worst but what he is doing goes way beyond ""maybe teasing you too much"" to being an abusive parent and I have no tolerance or love for people who abuse their own children.

Please try not to let your dad ruin your relationship with food. You didn't need to change your healthy way of eating because your dad is a jerk. I agree that you need to get away from him as soon as you can feasibly move out so you can learn to love and respect your body again. That might sound extreme, but if he's driving you to unhealthy ways of eating then he is damaging your health and you should not accept living with someone who does that to you. Good luck to you."
383,"If she does bring up, I would say I went to mgt to dispel any rumors etc. And that you were cleared of any wrong doing."
384,Uhh...both of you see a doctor?
385,It generally seems to be people who have a large disconnect between the emotional side of sex and the physical side of sex.
386,"I once went on a date with a man who immediately took it upon himself to tell me all about the horrible rumours out there him. He was semi sort of famous (not that I knew on our first date he was in some poetical punk band haha) but he told me straight away all about an ex who spread rumours and tarnished him, spread lies, turned people against him, ruined his career... It was very weird he was telling me this! I was immediately turned off.

And do you know what? He ended up being a bit of a weirdo and he is now in a relationship but will still text me for nudes... 

Don’t mention it! Not at least for a while when you can jokingly ask if she ever heard that rumour about you. She will find out for herself on your date that you are not a creep :) good luck"
387,"""Complete and utter biscuit"" lmao 😂"
388,"Yeah, it is creepy when people just randomly say stuff like that. My friend talks about a time she was in a  small book store, and the only other person there was a male employee. She hadn't really paid him any mind, until he came up to her while she browsed and was like ""Just so you aren't worried, I'm not, like, a rapist or anything.""

She left pretty quick after that and hasn't been back."
389,"He used to play the same sport she wants her kids to pursue, so she is basically looking up to him as a role model for her kids, without caring about the fact that he was toxic and hurt me. Also, he LIVES for other people validation, so this is heaven for him. He does not care about this person but he is being praised basically, without even thinking about the fact that it is my family we are talking about and yes, it is weird after they only saw each other a couple times and also live in different parts of the globe. She, on the other hand, likes his attention probably and she's acting like a teenager.
Your situation is way way more plausible and understandable.

I will most probably cut her out, hinting that I'm not comfortable and that this is embarassing.

Thank you for your kind opinion."
390,Was her makeup in that room by chance? Is that where she got ready?
391,"TALK to your roommate. Tell her ""Amy, I know you want a dog, but I'm a little worried about the logistics. We live in a high rise, so taking the dog out 3+ times a day is going to be tricky, especially with your busy schedule. Are you planning to hire a dog walker or come home at lunch? Dogs need a lot of time and attention and I'm very stressed that this will fall on me as I happen to be home more- but I have no interest in being responsible for a dog. What steps are you going to take to ensure that I don't have to look after it?"""
392,"Yeah don't keep it casual. Confident, yes. But casual, no. ""That's a rumor that was started by X, and I don't know why. I spoke to HR about it because I was concerned about it when I heard about it. You can ask her about it, because I don't know where it came from.""

Treat it like a serious allegation that you have nothing to do with."
393,People with broken morals and feelings. All end up with prescribed psych meds and then complain about it.
394,It sounds like you have a medical issue. Go see a doctor ASAP
395,"Its her way of letting you down easy. The fact that she ends with I'm so sorry basically means you wont see each other again.

398,Then look into a local game night or something that you can do together.
399,"Yeah and playing an audio book about open relationships around someone is kind of weird, like almost like she is grooming her. I’d keep my head on a swivel with this one. Maybe she’s a scam artist, maybe she’s trying to hook up with your gf, but maybe she’s just independently wealthy and a little eccentric but completely innocent. Personally, I wouldn’t say anything or take any action, and I’d keep being nice to her and trying to get to know her just like you would with anyone your gf is close with. I’d just keep tabs on this."
400,"That's some manipulative behavior there. It'll be good that you can't find anyone else like him, because sounds like he's not that great (for you, at least). And it's crazy to expect you to want to ""settle"" at 19!"
401,"He doesn’t feel he needs to get help but wants me to get signed up to see a therapist or get meds for my depression. He said he’d go with me but I told him that’s not fair for me to have to do it and he doesn’t when I feel it’ll be good for him too. We usually have really great communication and have always gotten through an argument or disagreement. He did say he hates that he has to pry stuff out of me when I’m annoyed sometimes. But I do the same thing with him. I think for us both it depends on what the topic is whether or not we are open to talk right away. But eventually we talk about what’s bothering each other. When we got back together we agreed to live separate when our lease was up and stay in a relationship since we skipped the dating part. We were just best friends who worked together and hung out a couple times, to bf and gf and moved in pretty quick. Only because we were gonna room mate with another friend and they flaked on us"
402,"&gt; They might want to have a meeting with your father and maybe that will embarrass him enough to get it together.

Embarrassing an abuser is a very risky move, especially when you're a minor and the abuser is your parent.  It _might_ make him realize he's been an asshole, but it might just piss him off more."
403,What magic planet dies he live on where receptionists make $60K? Or where anyone makes that much without education and degrees or at least a ton of experience clawing your way up the ladder?

405,"Honey, -RUN-. People who live you don't treat you like that."
406,"I was sent this by a friend (of the female variety) because I joke around about this a lot, but sarcastically. As a beautiful man myself, this isn't really the issue you're making it out to be. Just don't escalate beyond traditional flirting. If someone escalates, or tries making marriage pacts with you, just laugh it off or something and she'll get the point. 

It also helps to dress really shitty when you're out and about. Trust me, it helps cut down on the looks a lot. It's great."
407,Ah yeah OP specifies she’s not committed to living solo forever in a comment.

410,"Hmm. Well that certainly fleshes out your relationship a lot more. 

And while I certainly don’t share your beliefs on abortion and religion (and I’m guessing politics lol), I’m sorry you’re in the spot you’re in.  It totally sucks.

It sounds you’ve been through a lot but it also sounds like he’s just not feeling you anymore. And that’s his right. And do you really want to be the person who he reluctantly comes back due to feeling guilty or pestered by you or his family? I mean, he keeps breaking up with for a reason. How important is that reason to you? 

Total guess but I would guess that there is something that he is dealing with that you don’t know about. It doesn’t have to be cheating or anything like that. It sounds like he might have had addiction problems or childhood trauma in the past that he is wrestling with. It also sounds like he might have untreated anxiety issues. 

I really don’t know. I guess all I know you can’t *make* people like you, love you. He may need some space. Just don’t go wasting what few yrs remain of your 20s stuck on someone who doesn’t communicate his reasons for leaving you. You deserve that."

413,"If you're fighting all the time, you should not move in together. It'll get worse."
414,"First, I’d NEVER give up my pets. Second, Your new bf sounds very toxic and controlling. I would not be moving in with him and would find a different solution!"
415,"I agree with you here, so before we went home for summer something happened between us and she told me had that day gone different she would have had a talk to me about what we are and where we were going, so I like to think maybe she too wants it to be a relationship but you never know untill that talk happens as it could have gone anywhere."
416,"They're dating

If that's a problem for you then yeah I guess you should be worried"
417,"Ew ew ew. I got my dog with my ex boyfriend and my fiancé and he got his dog when he was married. When I get out of bed in the morning his dog follows me around and my dog takes my spot as little spoon. Pets are as good as family and he sounds like a b hole. 

Get a roommate, get a second job, get out of your relationship because it sucks. I vote you leave him and use your new free time to get a second job."
418,"Don't speak about a grown ass woman with these children's terms like acting out and temper tantrum, you fucking prick. Jshe may be going through shit you arent aware of. And an adult simply not complying or having emotions you dont expect doesn't make it okay for you to talk down and patronize her."
419,"Tricky.. 
the only thing I could firmly say didn’t sit well with me (regardless of explanation) is listening to that audiobook in front of the kid. 

However, your GF is a functioning adult and presumably can do life well enough.

I’d say, don’t do anything. Keep your eyes open if your instincts are telling you to though - instincts are great. 
At most, when your gf tells you about a behaviour that seems SUPER OFF (like audiobook) maybe just say to her ‘so what was your take on that?’ And see what your gf says. Maybe she is also having some red flags coming up but at the same time enjoying hanging with this character for now.

Don’t put your judgement on it, let your gf have her process. 

There does seem to be the possibility of some victim and milking others. By the title of that audiobook I could easily imagine she thinks it’s fine to take from others to fund her lifestyle as long as it’s ‘ethical’ (ie how can I find an excuse to take from others and still feel like I’m evolved and wonderful and good ;)
OR, she may actually jus the independently wealthy.
Or maybe she is a hooker (no judgement st all)

Bottom line, it’s your gfs process. You’re having your own process and of course you can share that ‘hey babe, something in my instincts just goes a bit off when jayMEE is around. What’s your read on her?’ but I really wouldn’t go too far beyond that and I’d respect your gf enough to trust she can manage her own relationships."
420,Your boyfriend is a creep and obviously doesn’t respect your relationship. I don’t know why you’d want to make it work with someone like this
421,"I think maybe just start it out by reminiscing?

Like, ""I was just thinking about the time that we \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ this summer haha, I just wanted to check in and say hi.  Things in Italy are fun, but I for real miss hanging out with you.""

This guy has known you for a while, he's not going to think that you're super weird no matter what you say."
422,You should probably check your home for cameras and search the internet for photos and videos of yourself.
423,"The problem is that this woman doesn’t know she’s being masturbated to, and likely won’t know until she either catches him in the act and has to live with the fact she’s been peeped at for who knows how long, or until you or someone else tells her. 

My advice? You should tell your neighbor and leave. He’s obviously got a ton of problems that aren’t easy to fix (like masturbating to your neighbors and liking teens)"
424,"Thank you! Nice to know someone else is in the same boat, haha. I'm trying really hard to stay in the moment which works until that wave of ""omgggg, so excited"" comes up every few weeks. I need to learn to keep them at bay!"
425,"Its a red flag. I don't think you have to dump her but you do need to set boundaries and expectations. If she accepts then and doesn't cross the line again, it could work if your willing to forgive her."
426,"Both of you. 

You should have pulled the plug far sooner. Trust was already gone.

You also should have respected her privacy and not snooped. You already knew she was being disingenuous, and breaking *her* trust isn't justified nor right."
427,Guilt. He makes me feel guilty for not being grateful for the help he gave me while I was struggling with my finals. And he says that I can't find anyone like him and will never have anyone else in my life since I don't wanna settle.
428,"I'm telling ya right now, the person you're see is exhibiting classic beginning red flags of a controlling/abusive partner. Your partner should not hold the favors he does for you against you. He should be kind and generous and expect nothing but affection and thanks in return. Moreover, girl, you're not even 20 yrs old. You got a whole lifetime to settle down. 

Fuck this guy."
429,That’s how I feel right now. I don’t want to hold on too much to the hope that the timing was just bad because I don’t want to stop myself from healing. We both really need to work on ourselves because we both had really hard things going on when things got bad. He felt like my person but letting him go was better for both of us mentally. At least right now.
430,"You have to decide what kind of relationship you want with this girl and when you get back to uni, talk to her about it. If she wants the same then all is well but if she doesn't then it's up to you to either accept what she wants or make a clean break."
431,"Yes, you are justified in your feelings.  You could always ask her about this and see what she says.  Do you still do any of these things with her as well?"
432,"&gt; Also, most people generally don’t like their exes... so that’s just something people say. “My ex is crazy”

436,"She has very intense control issues stemming from somewhere that were exacerbated by your cheating, I won’t go so far as to say that caused it since what you’re describing is very extreme. 

If you don’t want to marry her and you think you’d be happy/happier without her, you need to break it off before she leaves her place to move in with you in the new city. She really needs to speak with a therapist or other professional, the control issues will not get better on their own."

440,"Well from what I know before we started dating, he didn’t smoke cigs nearly as much as he has since our first break up. He quit actually on his own because he’s very aware of how unhealthy they are and switched to vaping. When we talked about him smoking again he told me he only did it because he was “self destructing”. He was gonna quit by the end of next month. And I know for a fact he is. I mean he’s the type of person that when he says he’s gonna do something, he does it. We have way more bigger differences than me not liking him smoking and have been able to respect each other on those things and it never got in the way of us being together. Me personally I don’t feel I’ve pressured him to be someone he isn’t, I’ve accepted him being himself in a lot of areas. I guess it would be different if he had been a heavy smoker before we became friends and started dating but he wasn’t"

443,"Trashing my stuff is a pretty new thing that pretty much just started happening with the other day when she threw some of my stuff on the floor. I don't remember what every argument we've had in the past was about but the one before this was because I basically said it wasn't abnormal for grown men to find teenage girls attractive and she thought I was defending pedophilia or something even though I was referring to post-pubescent young women. She got really in her feelings about it and got upset even though I was trying to make it clear that I'm not saying it's right, but that it's just a not-so-great natural aspect of our biology. Because of that she locked me out of the house on a hot day and threw all my stuff on the floor.   


To be honest, these past few events have me feeling really, really low and for the first time in a long while I've actually been having a lot of suicidal thoughts."
444,Break up with this guy immediately. You need to get therapy as well because you keep attracting terrible guys/relationships. So I would stay single for at least 6 months to a year so you can get in to a healthy mindset and attract a decent human being. And keep the animals. If I had a dog there is a 0% chance I'd be getting rid of it to appease a partner. Once I'd adopted it the dog would have priority.

449,"This saga is highly suspicious and contains more red flags than a soviet parade. Here would be my main concerns:

1. Her choosing to spend time with Thomas knowing you will be apart. That’s huge. Shouldn’t you come first? 

2. Maybe the hand on the waist was unwanted . . .   but if that’s the situation, why continue to hang out, especially in a somewhat secretive manner? My gut suggests that she now knows he is interested and is mirroring interest back. 

3. With respect to previous cheating in her relationships, do you know that the infidelity was a 1 way street? Not always, but often when someone’s partner cheats it is because they themselves were also less than loyal. 

I would have a serious discussion about the nature of her and Thomas’s relationship and set firm boundaries. You don’t have to be controlling, but it is imperative that she respects your relationship. After all, YOU should be the most important person to her, not her “friends.”"
450,"After reading your comment I tried to talk to her to apologize and work things out but she's stonewalling me. I get that what I said might have been a low blow but it feels like she's being overly angry and unreasonable with this. I don't know how we'd break it off. We've been together for 4 years and we live together in an apartment with other roommates on a lease. We have pets together that are like our children, and if we split up there's a good chance I'd be moving very far away."
451,"Dude, he's gonna murder you if you stay with him. Financially struggling (but still being able to pay rent, bills, and have food) sucks, but it's not the end of the world. If it's doable until you find a roommate, do it until you find a roommate."
452,"Wow, what a convoluted situation you have got yourself into!

It is really strange that most of her acquaintances and family are aware of your existence and hold such a positive opinion of you. I know this does not add to the discussion, I just wanted to voice my genuine surprise. So, back on track:

&gt; do you think it’s possible for a girl who fell so quickly in love with a stranger to be completely loyal to him? 

It depends. I know a couple who met each other in high school. She was going out with a guy, met this new fella and dumped his boyfriend's ass to be with him. Without disclosing their ages, I will say they have grown together and overcome so many life changing situations that I am certain they would not cheat on each other. Your girl friend, however, is 21. She's a young adult, her morals and direction in life are already dictated for the most part. To her, abuse justifies cheating (it seemingly does not justify leaving the other guy, just an observation). Who knows what situations could arise with you that could, in her eyes, justify going back to the dating app?

&gt; I’ll address the apartment situation 

I do not know how easy or hard it is in the States, but I fee her priority should be getting a job for herself. Perhaps it is just the way you worded it that rubbed me the wrong way, it is not a big deal. I do think that, were you to move in together, this dynamic would be far too similar to what she already has going on. Just keep that in mind.

&gt; she even talks about marriage 

Well, you are not the first guy in this story she talks to about marriage. That does not mean much, if you ask me.

&gt; I really do believe this is a girl that was in a bad situation that found what she was looking for 

I totally agree. Let us say there is abuse. I will take your word for it. The abuse exists and is the catharsis for her reaching out to a stranger in a dating app when engaged. I would be concerned about this. You are her knight in shining armor, leading the way through the castle against the bad dragon that is holding her hostage. All fairytales with a love angle include some variation of this trope. None will tell you about what happens when the princess and the knight move together and resume their regular lives once the big baddie is done for. As soon as she breaks up with this guy, you will be her boyfriend, not her hero. It would not be the first case where the stark contrast between the routine of a normal relationship and the emotional charge of a story like yours ends up making the relationship impossible.

As an expert on the matter of idealising the opposite sex with frustrating results, I think the two of you should take it down a notch and hold a serious conversation about the future. Not princess to knight, goddess to hero, but potential boyfriend to potential girlfriend.  Analyse where your relationship is, what troubles and doubts each of you may have and come as clean as possible before making a move. Honestly, I think there are way to many adverse factors and both of you have too much of a baggage right now to start a relationship. But if you want to make this work, there are many situations you need to clarify before making the move."

454,"Long distance is hard. My husband I were long distance for four years, and it definitely caused some friction at the time. 

He was in the military training for his job for a lot of it, and I was at school getting my degree, so we were both very busy. We also both like our alone time. For us, every day without fail for a video call would probably have been a bit much. 

We also had issues with texting for a bit. But an hour or two isn't that long honestly. I hated feeling like I couldn't be out enjoying life because I was constantly on my phone. I just accepted that we wouldn't have a ""normal"" conversational pace a lot of times because of the distance, and that was okay. I thought there was something pretty cool in us having rich, separate lives independent of one another, but still choosing to be together. It kept conversations interesting too.

I do, however, think it's pretty shitty if you guys have a standing date to video chat and you have to wait until 2-3am. My husband's a night owl, and I'm an early morning person. We'd compromise. We'd call later than I'd prefer, but earlier than he would. We'd both make small preference sacrifices because we valued each other. 

I'd tell him how valuable that face-to-face time is with him. How does suggesting fewer video chats, but he has to start showing initiative with them (working around your schedule more). 

I will say, long distance is really, really not for everyone. Most people aren't happy in them-they're torture. And you have to really consider if the pros outweigh the cons."
455,"I wish this was a joke.

When I say ""Crashing"" I don't mean running them into walls, but he bought a new car and purposefully drove it around this off road area until it was fucked up, obviously it's still a functional car, but he sold it and bought a new one because he didn't want to ""spend money fixing it when I can get a new one"""
456,"I will ask her that today when I see her, with milkshake in hand of course, thanks! :)"
457,"Before this particular incident I was talking to her about needing some better coping mechanisms when things don't work out so she doesn't keep hitting herself in the head and I mentioned that I'd pay for therapy sessions but she seemed resistant to the idea (which came as a surprise because the last time we talked about it she seemed like she was looking forward to getting therapy.) This time she expressed concern that they might put her in a psychiatric hospital, it would go on her record, and she wouldn't be able to get a job in the medical industry."
458,"I don't get that at all. I think there's some mental hangup here about being outed officially, and not just in words."
459,"Stay cool and don’t start a fight with him. You both will regret it one day. Instead of trying to convince him except your father how he is. 
I guess you love your father a lot otherwise you wouldn’t care so much about his opinion because if it was just an acquaintance people wouldn’t really care about it. When he starts a debate just answer with a simple “i see”, “If you think so dad”, “ Haha maybe you are right”. But important is that you still have to show interest! Don’t simply ignore him.
You will see, he won’t be mad anymore. 
You should look on the bright side, it seems like your father is still a vivid and talkative person😊(some people don’t care about politics at all or have the even have the privilege to discuss with their parents).
And what your brother did to you was just mean. Siblings should “always” stick together."
460,"Plain and simple. How are you and your husband engage in sex is nobody‘s business but your own. I agree with you, her comments and meddling have gone way too far. You are not the only one who is married and use condoms, but again it’s nobody‘s business but your own. If I were in the situation I would let her know simply that I don’t want to talk about it. Let her know if she continues to bring it up but you will walk away or hang up. If she doesn’t get the picture you may need to block her and walk away. This is a non-issue for a friend, it has no impact on them. You guys do you and don’t look back."
461,"Yeah it's not ok for your boyfriend to tell you that you aren't the most attractive person. He's mean, isn't into you, is shallow, admits that he has a wandering eye, and isn't serious about your future. Time to break up"
462,"It means she doesn't want to date you. If she wanted something casual, she would have said so. I know it's ambiguous and it's tempting to try to figure out if she was implying something. But basically she said what a lot of people say when they mean, ""nice chatting with you, not interested in seeing you again."""
463,"she is your ex for a reason. i know you miss her, but she needs space to do other things, thats why you guys broke up. shes busy doing other stuff and you should be too. go find things to fill your time and rely less on communicating with her and activities with her. it will make you happier and the time you do see her will be more special."
464,"This isn’t attraction, it’s sexual harassment"
465,"This one might work out. The important thing is to recognize what you want and set boundaries with him. 

I used to go through that scenario you described of dating a guy casually and then getting hurt when it didn’t work out. Eventually, I decided that I wasn’t sleeping with anyone I outside of a serious relationship. This happened to be the right thing for me because it kept me from getting too attached too early in the relationship. 

What worked for me may not be for you. There are other ways of establishing boundaries. You know yourself best. But it’s good to know where you both stand early on."
466,"I think everyone has known someone like  that - it isn't healthy to ditch all your friends for your SO, and in my experience that behavior has often been coupled with a fairy tale idea of what it means to be in love.  If he's as much of a dud as you say, the relationship will probably break down eventually.  With that, you can:

\-Try talking to her now about how you feel, knowing that it may work or it may fall on deaf ears.  If you do this, probably emphasize that healthy friend relationships are normally necessary for a healthy long-term romantic relationship.

\-Back off, not cutting her out completely but not quite putting in extra leg work to maintain bff status either.  Wait until the relationship ends and then discuss, when she will be forced to listen.

\-End the friendship."

468,"I turn 18 in literally a year. I turned 17 two weeks ago. I’ve been trying to save money, but before this month, I was only working like 15hours, at 8.80 an hour... which is not much to be honest... and so I had to pay them my whole check of $200 last week and been surviving on like $5 for this week. Pay day tomorrow :/ and school starts this week so my checks will be smaller."
469,"Thank you for this comment, it actually made me cry a little because I realised how spot on you are. I actually used to have a pretty good relationship with my dad but now that I think about it there's been many times where he's subtly manipulated me emotionally, I just didn't want to see it or admit it. Like when my mom was still alive, I was actually closer to my dad because he always allowed me the things my mom forbid me in secret and I only recently realised how that strained my relationship with her.

&gt; ""Do you have any trusted adults in your life that you can reach out to for help?"" 

I have my uncle on my mum's side who I'm close with but he lives on another continent and has a lot of health issues so I don't want to unload on him. However just normally talking to him on the phone makes me feel better so at least I have that. I don't know anyone on my dad's side of the family though.

Thank you for your advice and encouragement, this comments is making me do some serious thinking and realising."
470,"You are a very sick, unwell person who has crossed the line so many times with this woman that I'm shocked she doesn't have a restraining order out on you. You literally put spyware on her computer to see her naked, stalk her, smell her underwear ... you should be in prison."

472,"&gt;we had an argument and I came home to a lot of my stuff thrown on the floor

So... how often has she done this exactly?

&gt;We've been through so many super rough patches in the past

Who do you think initiated those mostly? What were your previous arguments about? Kind of seems like there's a lot of built up resentment on both sides- she mocks you for no reason and you don't hesitate to bring up something that upset her before in retaliation.

You haven't spoken since yesterday? Sounds like one of those moments where you feel a certain point of no return has been reached. You're both frustrated but don't even want to talk about it to each other anymore. Obviously saying that only based on what you wrote here, which is a tiny, skewed summary of your time together."
473,"i was leaning towards saying that you were being reasonable until you mentioned feeling jealous and asking her to distance herself from two of her exes. i think there may also be some amount of insecurity on your part when you think that they'll go back to her in a flash. jealousy and insecurity are your issues, and you're the only person who can fix them. asking your girlfriend to distance herself from her exes is just a temporary fix. it's just avoiding the things that trigger your jealousy and insecurity.

you said that you've not felt particularly jealous in other relationships, so i think there's something about your partner that causes you to feel jealous and insecure. i'd recommend that you talk to her about your feelings, but she seems to be unable to do that at the moment. now i'm leaning towards you being reasonable and your partner being crazy. you have a problem talking with your partner about your feeling. the problem isn't on your end. the problem is on your partner's end. this show's that you're being reasonable.

communication is key to any relationship. you're ability to communicate with your partner has broken down. you can definitely fix this, but she has to be willing to meet you half way. if she isn't willing to do that, then i don't see any other option but to break up and go your separate ways."
474,Last night she was on the porch and when i came out she immediately said her friend was asking her a question.  Then said she was texting another friend.  The 2nd one i know isnt the friend she said it was.  Thats the one i mentioned in my post.  Ive asked her who shes texting but im scared of the reaction id get if i asked to read it.  Ive never had any doubts about her before and dont want either one of us to react in the wrong way.  I have a lot more at stake than her.  I picked up my life and moved in  with her.  If this ended us id be not only heartbroken but homeless as well.

479,I think you should dump him if he is so shallow as to base his future life plans on how is partner looks. That doesn’t sound like someone I would want to be in a relationship with anyway.
480,"Bright Eyes was great as an emo 16 year old. As a mid 30s adult, it came up in a Spotify playlist and I listened to a couple albums again. It's so, so cringey to me now. Your girlfriend probably missed them entirely, so it's just slightly creepy emo from a low-T male. I totally get her point on the music. 

That said, you two don't seem to really like each other all that much or respect one another. Might be time to call this over at this point."
481,"I think it's important to learn to trust your own decisions and opinion. The reason you trust other people more over your own decisions could be because you undervalue your own values and opinions. You think yours is somehow worse than what others say. This is one skill that needs to be worked on and developed through making a lot of decisions, as well as observe and learn what your boundaries are. If they are crossed, you need to openly communicate to set them straight. Your ex is taking advantage of you financially, your new bf is about to guilt trip and manipulate you to take advantage of you financially. Not only I believe you need some time off to work on yourself, your new bf also needs time to work on himself. He has anxiety and is depressed, and can't respect his gf. He is too young, he doesn't know what he is doing yet. Don't enable his bad behaviour, that is not good for anyone and esp not good for himself either."

I spend the entire time shoving them away, telling them they're prisoners and can never leave, close the door slowly on them, etc. It's cute and funny, but exasperating, so I'm smiling but slightly irritated. It's hard to describe.

The real problem is that you don't like to treat your cat that way, and your boyfriend doesn't respect you enough to agree without turning it into manipulation. Never touching the cat again? Come on dude, nobody said that. He's overreacting and immature and disrespectful."
486,"I suspect something like a scary health diagnosis that either she or a family member got, personally, but if she won't talk to you about it there's really nothing you can do except break up with her or keep dealing with her tantrums."

The relationship is over, and you should be thinking about what's best for you. You may have an easier time getting over the break-up if you don't communicate with him for a while -- and you get to decide how long a while. Things do get better over time, but it's a very hard road. Forget what he wants and think about yourself."

491,"I think it's pretty normal in a relatively new relationship, to be very into your partner, spend most of your time with them, and to bring them up to your friends a lot. It may not be how you do your relationship, but that doesn't make it wrong. In fact, it makes your relationship look a bit cold.

The situation that this man (whom you've only been dating for 6 months) wants you to move into is all kinds of sketchy in my opinion. What exactly does he bring to the table in this relationship (other than the possibility of a free, sketchy place to live)?

He's already being controlling and manipulative. I mean, what gives him the right and the authority to impose all those bullshit rules? Don't wear moisturizer? WTF? IMO the sooner you detach your life from his, the better. 

Don't worry about a decision that makes ""all parties"" happy. Worry about what makes *you* happy and what makes your family of pets (who love you unconditionally and don't try to control you) happy. Please don't let this man fuck up your life."

I can't be her entire social life. And i don't know a polite way to say i don't have time to be friends. I think i'm just going to keep saying i'm busy when i am busy and hope she makes friends. She already has cried because i told her i couldn't go to an event with her because i'll be out of town and said ""but your my friend"" and has started worrying about finding a new roomate next year because ""they won't be you"". And i have only known her a week. It's not healthy for her either. I just feel bad that she feels so alone and has such a hard time making friends. Think i'm just going to have to keep saying i'm busy and hope she gets the hint and makes other friends."

507,I wouldn't bother with explaining anything. His attitude reeks with assholery (and the fact he dates a teenager is also quite telling).

2. If you are NOT, then is it bothering you?

  


If its NOT bothering you, let it go. No need to do a damned thing.

  


If it's bothering you, then let her know right away. ""Hey, I noticed that we do a lot of couple things together, and sometimes people mentioned that we're together as a couple. I just wanted to say that I haven't said anything up until now, but in the future, I would prefer it if we would clarify that we're not together. Nothing personal, I just want to make it clear that we're just friends. Thanks.""

  


End of problem.

  


3. If you ARE interested in her, Now's the Time to bring it up. ""Hey, we have a really good time together, and I noticed when people bring up that we're a couple, you don't really say much about it. That got me to thinking, would you like to go on an actual date date? See how it goes?""

  


If she says ""oh my gosh no, we're just friends!"" then you have your answer. Then you can let her know that you'd prefer that she clarifies to other people that you're just friends, or you can let it go. See the previous steps. And if she wants to go on a date, take it from there."
513,How on earth is being worried and stressed that your girlfriend is being harassed constantly by her ex and wanting to help a “red flag?” He just wants to help and it’s stressful for both of them. That doesn’t mean he should contact the ex and OP needs to come up with a plan of action here but calling it a red flag is over the top.

No, you didn't.

539,"This is a 6-month relationship. When you adopted your pets, they believed you were providing a forever home. 

This is also an 11-year age gap, which is not \*necessarily\* bad but is when the older and more experienced partner is pressuring the younger one like this. He's created this all or nothing situation, and it is 100% NOT your responsibility to make all parties happy. 

Is there a way you can get a roommate to move in with you? Can you start a gofundme campaign to ease the burden of your bills? Do you qualify for govt assistance with food and/or housing, or budget billing for your utilities? I have been put in a similar situation recently and it is just difficult and horrible, but I have enough life experience to know what I absolutely will not put up with. Don't give up your 20's (or your pets) to this guy. If housing is as difficult in your area as it is in mine, finding a roommate in a similar situation who wants to move in with you AND loves cats and dragons should be relatively easy. You have more options than he's giving you! Is there a local college you can post a flyer at, or advertise on their online announcements/jobs board? You can find and start to vet potential roommates that way."

I don't understand why though. One talk and that's it, pretend it didn't happen afterwards? I understand if you feel you don't have enough invested to put in the elbow grease but issues of passion and complacency are both very solvable assuming two willing participants."

569,You're just going to demonize everything I say so what's the point?  Have a nice evening. :)
570,"I am going to chime in because I don't agree with other commenters who think the relationship is a write-off. I just think your boyfriend has poor boundaries, and will do anything to keep others (and you, especially) happy. Even if that means downplaying (lying about) his own feelings. I may be biased, because that was and somewhat still is me. And my boyfriend, for that matter. We are quite a pair. I don't think it is unfixable, because we have both been able to really improve this with good communication.

I DO think, though, that you are pretty much already doing all you can to help him. He has to recognise that this behaviour is harming his relationships rather than helping and then he needs to build new habits. This type of problem is usually a maladaptive coping mechanism, which means that at some point in his past, this behaviour was necessary to survive, but it has since become unhealthy and stopped serving him. He needs to SEE and FEEL that it is not serving him to start the process of change.

It sounds like you have already tried to tell him that it harms trust and therefore the relationship. All you can really do is try to have a big, serious come to Jesus talk where you really lay out how it harms you and what will happen if he continues - the eventual breakdown of the relationship - and see if he acts on it. Therapy is an excellent step. Maybe ask him why he does it, and whether something happened in childhood or past relationships for him to feel that lying to you to keep the peace is the best option. Get some cogs turning in his brain. After that, it is all on him.

As for the girl, I can't possibly conjecture. He needs to come forward with whatever it is he is so uncomfortable sharing, and if he does it is a good sign that he is hearing you.

I could be wrong. I am a psychology hobbyist at best. But it might be a place to start."
571,"You were looking for a problem.  You found a problem.  Part of the reason you don't fo snooping is you don't know the full story.  Life have a funny way of being very vague.

People lie when they feel threatened, you spying on her the first few times, showed her the truth won't help you.

I don't know if she cheated.  It certainly looks that way - But to be fair all you know is a few texts and half truths.

You are clearly paranoid about Dan, and you have made up your mind.  Cut your losses, let her be free and you should understand that you do not need to know EVERYTHING about someone.

If you look for a cheater you will ALWAYS find one.  So try not looking so hard next time."

573,"Your father is a manipulator and a giant crybaby, to be frank. Blaming your mother because you want to be an independent adult and not live at home forever?  


Don't move back home. This is NOT your fault. Your father is an adult, your mother is an adult - it's not your responsibility to clean up your father's mess.   


Your mom and brother, if your father has really left - can figure out what money they have, if they can sell the house, etc. and move into someplace they can afford. They can also reach out to the rest of the family and ask for help. You are NOT the only financially literate person around, they're just using this to put even more pressure on you to come back."
574,"Hi OP.

I wanted to share my experience in this.  I was in an open relationship with a guy for two years, which was two years too long.  I felt insecure and jealous CONSTANTLY.  It ate me alive.  I cried so much so frequently that I felt nauseous all the time.  Much like you, I read up on it a lot, I had days where it didn't bother me so much and times where I felt like I could accept it... and then I'd be with him and he'd get a message from the other girl, and it would ruin my day.  I tried.  I really tried.  I'm not someone that usually struggles with jealousy, but it settled down in my brain.  I tried to be nice to the other girl - I never disliked her, and I honestly didn't feel threatened by her, I just couldn't deal with the overthinking anymore.

I'm going to be real with you.  Medication might help with your depression and anxiety, but I don't think it's going to help you with this.  I think that your gut feeling is telling you that this might not be right for you - it's been months and you still haven't felt good about this.  You know that it has an end date of January, that you're not going to follow through with long-distance stuff, and you've literally said that it's making you miserable.  Why are you trying to convince yourself to feel good about something that you feel terrible about?  What is it about your own feelings that you don't believe or trust?  Your feelings here are completely valid.

I know what it's like to meet someone who's absolutely amazing, like noone you've ever met before, and to just feel completely swept away by them.  To want good things for them, to feel overjoyed to be a part of their life, to want them to be happy, to not want to encroach upon their freedoms to have their own relationships in the way that they wish.  And I think that you wanting that for your person makes you a very special person in return.  I think that you're trying in the same way that I tried.  I wish I had better things to say to you that would be helpful.  I've never tried this, but I could see you doing well with a sex-positive counselor - someone who could help you process your feeling of depression and anxiety, who could really help you build up your ability to cope with your anxieties, and to dig through what your needs really are in a relationship.

All of this being said, I think you're focusing more on this person's wants/needs than you are your own needs, and, well, that's just no good for you.  You talked about your ideal relationship.  Think more about that.  Think about what your want, how you want to be treated.  Think about how you would feel if your needs really were being met.  In the meantime, here's something else to do:

Sit down or lay down in a comfortable spot.  Put both hands on your lower belly.  Take slow, deep breaths, in through your nose, and out through your mouth.  Feel your belly rising and falling with each breath.  Breathing exercises aren't always helpful for everyone, but it's been my sword and shield in dealing with anxiety.  You can do them anywhere without anyone knowing about it ."

I’ve been spreading myself too thin travelling on planes constantly to see him in between shift work and trying to find some kind of routine. 
There’s the added pressure of him wanting to change my life to move up with him. 

I think your bf needs to think about his values, what he wants for himself truly, and to focus on getting back to a positive place.

It even says in my post that that is small potatoes compared to the other stuff.  I don't think I should have to defend why I get a bad vibe from this person.  Even if you don't agree with me, that doesn't change the fact that I just think something is shady about her and it worries me."
600,"Second choice

Either your friends are shady or the wedding coordinator is shady (or had a memory problem). For the sake of your friendship, I'd choose the later and never recommend this place to anyone. Just consider the deposit a part of the wedding cost and move on. Time to start your married life."
601,"I know! Had I known he was this afraid of commitment, even though we had a handfasting in October, I don't know if I would have gotten in this deep."
602,"You made a compromise with the intent of making an easy transition for an older animal who doesn’t need to be stressed by a kitten. 

Baby animals have significantly different needs from an adult animal. 

You set a boundary based on making an easy transition for everyone involved. Your bf agreed. 

And then, in a weird “performance” he publicly just steamrolls you. As an adult understands why an older cat is ideal; but decides in the moment to not only be rude but selfish. 

He’s being a jerk. If he wasn’t on board with your compromise and boundary, he needed to discuss that. The way he went about it is gross."
603,"&gt;. I don't care.

Cared enough to waste your time, that's for sure."
604,"Yeah I’m sad at how many people are just ignoring the “why” behind the decision here which is: a kitten is a lot on an older cat. They are physically rough; and as they age and try on power struggles, they can be really awful to an older cat who can’t fully get away. 

My husband said no to a kitten because we have an older cat and he said he didn’t want her to live the rest of her years hiding in our bedroom. So we made, you know, a considerate choice not based on “aww cute”"
605,"Yes, you are. Good luck with it."
606,"One of the biggest red flags I can think of is how a person treats and is recieved by animals. To a person, I've never met anyone who was worth being around who mistreated an animal or who was regularly disliked by one of my pets."
607,"Your frustration is entirely warranted. 

Everyone in the situation swept it under the rug and then expected it to be your problem exclusively. 

I, too would demand repair receipts from the venue, btw.  It’s not unusual for places to inflate the cost to repair and replace items, especially items that have some age and indeterminate value."
608,"You cheated, that was shitty. 

She decided to remain with you (God knows why?!) but she has not forgiven you. When you forgive someone, you genuinely take steps to work on and rebuild the trust. You do not bring past 'shit' every single time there is an argument in the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

You are toxic together. Move on......and do not cheat next time you are in the committed relationship."
609,"Same and I didn't get diagnosed until 27! Mania and depression can create disproportionate irritable responses. Meltdowns are not uncommon because *you're already under so much stress already and why is everything so unfair and can't anyone see how much pressure you're under and cut you some freakin' slack?!?!* Obviously OP can't broach the whole ""hey you might have mental illness"" without another nuclear event but they need to approach this as an overall wellness intervention."
610,"I had this issue in a relationship.. ex told me they'd be with their crush in a heartbeat if they could (they worked together)

Needless to say,  the relationship didn't last."
611,"Okay, that's you. Eventually you'll mature a bit more, hopefully, and that will change."
612,"You are right, I need more self respect.  The hard part is it is almost like she has multiple personalities, when she is not being unfaithful she is so much fun and we are so good together, but when she gets involved with someone else she is manipulative and mean. Thanks for you true words!"

618,"I've noticed too many people brush off red flag incidents as a temper/anger issues. When really it's unhealthy emotion regulation, lack of accountability, and lack of consideration of others. The fact that he went off and then tried to make it out like he wasn't while doing it is a problem. You need to set up boundaries of what will absolutely not be tolerated if you choose to stay."
619,"It doesn’t sound like her partner isn’t invested. It sounds like he doesn’t want to have sex with one person forever. The parameters by which he is thinking about this is either/or. If OP would be comfortable opening up relationship, then it might bring them closer. And it could swing both ways too. OP could meet a new person too. It’s an option. Maybe not workable for this couple but it’s definitely an option."
620,"If it is that big of a struggle (and I can relate), talk about that first. Let him know that you need this to be clear before moving any further. Explain to him how this whole situation makes you feel. If you open up to him first, he should in theory be more prone to opening up as well. 
I hope that, if you have ""the conversation"", it turns out to be productive and brings the best for you, be it on your own or with him."
621,Because they have an old cat and kittens are a lot of stress for older cats. Because he’s an adult who understands this but literally got overwhelmed by kitten cuteness and decided to make a selfish decision.
622,"Be careful breaking up with someone you care for in order to ""live your young life"" and whatever else people say. With the right person, all of the crazy things you want to do with your youth just get better when you have someone to share it with. I know plenty of people who did the same and are now mourning the ""one who got away"" while desperately seeking real intimacy and connection from quick flings well into their 30s.

Not saying don't do it. Just think it out. If you could imagine a great life with her if you could include her in your social life, then talk to her openly. My social anxiety has always been aided by having an extrovert with me, someone who would help carry conversations when I slacked, introduce me to people comfortably, etc. and by providing that for her you may be able to help her ease that anxiety while also encouraging her to make friendships on her own, without you.

On the other hand, some people just don't like going out and being social all the time. It's not how they want to spend their time. If that's the case, just end it. She'll be happier long term with someone who wants the same things as her and enjoys spending their time in the same ways. So will you. Sometimes a little pain in the present is still what's best for the future.

Wall of text to match a wall of text. Hope this helps!"
623,Mood stabilizer and antipsychotic? I’ve been on that combo too lol. I was just switched off it and given two antidepressants and trileptal as a mood stabilizer. Props to you for taking your meds and sticking with it.
624,Public quiet place without him?
625,I want to change and I am seeking professional help. That does not excuse my actions and I own up to everything I did. The best I can do now is to become better and never hurt another person again like this
626,"Long distance is tough on both people, it requires a lot of trust and maturity. But, this is a 28 year old man, he isn't a teenager. It's long past time to grow up and he's showing that he can't handle responsibility well. Also to further show he's irresponsible, any progression he's made in school or his job was thrown away by quitting and spending a ton of money on a spontaneous trip. Is this the kind of loose cannon you want in a partner? What if this relationship was truly serious where you were married and he spent a significant chunk of your shared savings on a trip unannounced?

I'm not saying people can't be stressed and need to take a day to decompress, I'm saying he has some serious issues he needs to work out (likely with a therapist) or he won't see any life improvements."
627,Being this intentionally obtuse isn't as cute or worry as you apparently think it is. Especially at your age.
628,I think you see the red flags. He is not looking out for your best interests here.
629,"I’m going to seek professional help, I don’t want to be this person anymore. I have to be better than this"
630,"This sounds exactly like my dad. He is absolutely bluffing, and yes, he has done this to exact control. He's angry that he made himself look foolish at the wedding, especially since he couldn't control any of you or your responses to his timing. I'm sorry you're in this position but know none of this is your fault and you are not responsible. I know it feels hard to believe, but he is at the center of all this drama, not you. I have been no contact/very low contact with my dad for over a year now and while it's not easy and it doesn't make all the trauma go away, things are better and with proper psychological help I beginning to heal.

&amp;nbsp;

Your father is toxic and as much as it sucks because he's supposed to be your dad and family is supposed to love each other unconditionally, blah blah blah, but sometimes that's just not the hand we're dealt. He sounds like he may be a narcissist. Maybe NPD is worth looking into?"
631,"Yikes. He seriously does sound like a (failed) cult leader. The OP's boyfriend is throwing up similar red flags. He wants her to a) sell all her possessions b) move in with him and 3 other men c) in a paid-for work situation/(commune???) d) where she's totally cut off from family e) won't have to pay rent but who knows what else they'll expect her to do to ""earn her keep""?

OP is in an abusive relationship and I would bet money is either about to join a cult or be sex trafficked"

633,"I'm going to say what I said on your previous post, someone who does this:

&gt; I did everything I could to make him happy. I would constantly remind myself not to do anything that will make him upset, including my choice of clothes because anything too revealing would be deemed as me trying to attract men on the streets. I cut off a lot of friendships for him as well and made him my priority. 

is not someone who wants a relationship with you, it's someone who wants to own you. He has made it clear that he doesn't see you as a partner, or as someone he respects, and he is holding choices you made when you were a child before you two started dating against them as though they are something you need to be ""forgiven for"" while he cheats on you and treats you badly.

Lean on your friends, let them help you stay strong, you're in the hardest part and you're going to be a lot better without this guy in your life."
634,"What are you going on about, I don't think OP has an issue with over masturbation might be more of a psychological issue from losing a child. When parents lose a child sometimes having sex again can be difficult. 

I think this situation is going to require more than meditating and less masturbation. I honestly don't even think you read this post"
635,"Anne isn't being your friend, so it's really not ""nuclear"" to end things with her. Her opinion on this could not matter less. And she's probably got all sorts of other shitty opinions, too."
636,"Anne is a fucking weirdo. The fact that she thinks it’s any of her business, that her opinion should mean anything to you, and that she shared it with other people is so outside of acceptable behavior I don’t even know where to start. She’s not a friend to you. Drop her and go have some protected sex with your mans."
637,"Tell your wife, feelings of limerance strengthen through secrecy. Accept the consequences of your actions, even if it ends in divorce. The path you're on leads to a place much worse than divorce my friend.

After telling your wife, you need to keep your distance from her sister as much as possible. Any time you have to be around her, talk to your wife about it and make the *conscious choice* to limit contact with her even if she's around. No part of your body should ever touch any part of her body ever again."
638,"Everyone else here is right. He's abusive, full stop. No matter how much he distorts and erodes your sense of self, know that you don't deserve to be abused.

Please also look out for the ""make-up."" If he's like my partner, he's likely to flip out, say unbelievably harsh things, then come back with apologies and sweetness. He may even be a skilled enough abuser to reframe the incident as you having been irrational, but he's sO KiNd aNd gOodHeArtEd that he'll ""forgive"" and even ""comfort you."" That part may feel intoxicating, but it's a ruse and part of a cycle. Don't fall for it."
639,"I don't think he is worth your time...
In my opinion, if he wanted to keep in touch he could have gotten your number when you parted. Or came into work one of those days to find you. The only reason he didn't is because he didn't care to or want to."
640,"Dude you don't even need to explain to us why you use condoms. You could just prefer that over trying to get on the pill for the first time, and that would be valid.

You're not overreacting; no need to apologize or feel bad about anything you did."
641,"Omg no none of this is your fault. You were in a terribly abusive relationship and this guy has manipulated you and gaslighted you to the point you truly believe you are the bad guy. This guy sounds like a piece of shit honestly. He calls you a slut bc of something you did at 15 when he is the one running around fucking random women. He tells you he is going to fuck around on you and you have to deal with it. Lmao! This guy is two fries short of a happy meal. Block his number and social media, get some counseling and move on with your life. You deserve someone who won’t hold your past against you, won’t abuse and manipulate you and will be 100% faithful. Do not go back to this dude, for real."
642,"I'm talking about self improvement, exercise, just having a overall better lifestyle. Yes but he is clearly attached if she's not willing to try it out the. So be it.  Meditation requires 1 party. Really that's all you need is yourself. People are too attached.  When you raise the crism, you start to manifest beautiful thing In your life. All though this is not the point.

At least I gave advice. All you two posted critasizm comments that thumbs downed me to boost your ego. Please I encourage to thumbs this post down as well if it makes you feel better.

Wish you all the best brethrens"
643,keep doing what you are doing. more pressure will drive her away. look at it as a long game - be chill and she will see you understand her needs.
644,I want to beat his face in. What a fucking dickbag.

648,"Your boyfriend sounds like my ex, and it is a fate I would not wish (even on my ex). Can you imagine going through future passings of loved ones and other hardships with someone who treats you that way? Eventually I could not. Life is hard enough as it is. I know it may take time for you to leave him, as it did for me also. But I hope you remember that you’re a person deserving of care, and love, and perhaps start planning an escape route - it’s always good to have when you do finally feel ready.

An analogy that might help as well. My best friend’s father passed away from cancer, and the anniversary of his death is equally as somber of a day for her and her family. When we all lived in the same city, her now-fiancé and I joined forces to provide her with as much support and comfort as possible, running around the city to pick up things and organize the annual celebration of life she had for him, and anything else we could do to make things easier on that day. Even if she acted out or behaved wildly (which you certainly did not), we would be as understanding as possible and try to care for her as well as we could. That’s what you do for people you love."

I don’t think you realize how disrespectful and dehumanizing this whole post is. She’s fun, pursuing a master’s degree, taking her meds and doing what she needs to do to stay healthy. Yet YOU seem to think she should be ashamed of who she is. Like you have to warn everyone about it because she might not be able to handle herself in public? That is disgusting.

Long story short, NO, you should not go around airing her private medical issues to your friends and family. That is her business. You’re not lying to anyone by excluding it because they don’t have a right to know! You’re girlfriend deserves better than this from you."
653,"Please don't let this guy's controlling and toxic behavior force you to give up your cats and dragon - your pets love you unconditionally, and you're their family too. If he can't accept your pets, on top of being a control freak and making you feel bad about yourself (no socks in bed? Srsly?) you need to kick his butt to the curb. If you want to continue to pursue a get-together roommate, that would probably be the better solution. I wish you luck!"
654,"Because of the age difference, it is likely that you are in different places in your life and, thus want different things. I'm not at all saying that love couldn't thrive between a 28 year old and a 40 year old; I'm just saying that where you currently stand in the world is miles apart, both literally and metaphorically. And it may be difficult to bridge that distance. I think you should just be honest--say something like, ""Look, this has become more than just a flirty thing for me, because our communication has become something I treasure and brings up some genuine emotions. I know there are a lot of differences between us, but where are you in your life right now, and do you think there might be a place in it for me?"""

Similarly, asking to sit in on one of his therapy sessions -- or, alternatively, to start couples counseling to address the very specific issues you raised -- would likely be productive. The only BAD thing I suspect you could do is try to ""fix"" him or assume full responsibility for any problems/issues you two might have; a lot of what he is struggling with has nothing to do with you, of course, so it may be hard sometimes to acknowledge that their is nothing you can ""do"" to fix his dark moods or uneven behaviors -- other than to be compassionate and attentive, which all relationships require to succeed, of course, regardless of each partner's mental health."

No offense, but he's clearly better off without crazy people like that in his life.
