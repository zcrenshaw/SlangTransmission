0,"&gt; how they should get drinks if it doesn‚Äôt work out


A *little* flirty? Dude's arranging dates. 


Look you're both extremely young and apparently of those 5 years most of it was long distance and plagued by break ups.



Where do you see your life going? Do you want this forever? Sitting at home, cooking? "
1,What next? break up with him. Tell him his free pass is for life because you deserve better. 
2,Maybe the ring is truly just uncomfortable for him/loose fitting and he's worried he might lose it. I'd tell him how much it means to you and perhaps suggest buying an alternative silicon ring that is less expensive and more comfortable. 
3,"This would be a deal-breaker for me. I'd never trust him again, especially  since he has no regrets. You decide if it's a deal-breaker for you. "
4,"This is super controlling. Do you want the rest of your relationship to be like this? "" This is crazy, no."" Just no, don't try and reason with her."
5,"omg, fuck ALL of that. These are roommates, not your kids. Make your own food and let them feed themselves. Tell them to fuck off, seriously.

edit: you can also tell them to fuck off in a nice way, like u/thedarkestbeer said.  :)"
6,"God, modern cheaters are so fucking dumb.  I mean, insta stories?  Come on, losers.  Jesus.

Yes, you should tell them.  I'm sorry that this is happening to you.  "
7,"This marriage sounds like a recipe for disaster from the start. You're both very young, you went straight from an unstable long distance relationship to married cohabitation, and you're left sitting at home in a place you don't know with no plans of your own. It really wouldn't matter if there was nothing at all on his phone; I'm sorry to tell you this, but your marriage isn't going to work out like you want it to.

Honestly I'm a little concerned that you were fine in the first place with uprooting yourself to sit at home on a military base all day every day, spouse or no spouse. You don't want your life to be founded on this lack of independence. You need to start making plans of your own, either for a job or for college/vocational training. You can do it with or without the husband, but you've got to move forward.

As for your husband: I would rarely say this, but honestly I don't think you have much to lose by just telling him what you found. You're probably going to be much better off leaving no matter what he says, but maybe this can be his wake-up call if he truly values you. This all said I'd fear for your long-term prognosis anyway; you should be aware that infidelity rates on deployments are *very* high as is, and you've got a husband who's already cool with the idea of a backup plan for the event of you not being in his daily life."
8,"Bail now. The fact that you have only been married 5 months is *more* of a reason to bail than to stay. You guys are still newlyweds, for Gods sake. If he cant keep it in his pants now, he NEVER will.  Also, you can never trust him on another trip or even a guys night out. This dude is super bad news. Take the hit now. In a couple of years it will just be a brief mistake. Dont fucking get entangled in years of financial &amp; emotional investment.

Edit: I never once took my own advice. I always followed my heart, hence I speak with some authority here. To quote High Fidelity...""I've been thinking with my guts since I was fourteen years old, and frankly speaking, between you and me, I have come to the conclusion that my guts have shit for brains.""

Edit: Obligatory, thank you so much for the gold! I assume either John Cusack (rad Twitter dude) or Nick Hornby (top 5 movies of all time, with a bullet) gave it to me, but if not, I am grateful nevertheless. üòç"
9,"&gt;I feel like my dad calculates these moments. Sometimes it's 8am on a Sunday or 11pm on a Monday. Holidays and always on my mom's birthday.

Stop taking him to the hospital yourself.  Every time this happens, call 911.   You could suggest a mental health assessment as well.

Stop going out in public with him.  Yes, your family will be unhappy about it but you are just going to have to let them feel however they want to feel.  You and your immediate family will be so much happier when you don't have to deal with this on a regular basis."
10,"I‚Äôm shocked by all the hate you‚Äôre getting. Wth? Of course you would tell your gf he‚Äôs getting engaged. Yes, it wasn‚Äôt smart to talk about it in the house with him there but my god this does not mean you‚Äôre some terrible human being or horrible roommate. Own up to it being in poor taste discussing it with GF and also communicate your concern. You do so from a place of compassion, you worry for his future and for his family relationships. However, at the end of the day it is his life and he will do what he pleases. If you want to be a good friend then you‚Äôll be there on the other end when it‚Äôs time to pick up the pieces. "
11,Sounds like the friend gave him a needed verbal slap in the face. 
12,"You‚Äôve only been together 3 mos and you‚Äôve posted to reddit 3 times about how you are unhappy with him

The first 3mos  are supposed to be infatuation, love, excitement

Think about this.  "
13,So glad you got through to him. I've read 3 different heartbreaking stories about people being scammed and catfished this week. Hope your friend is ok after the realisation. It must feel horrible.
14,"""Your brother/brother-in-law assaulted me outside of the house last night. He confessed his feelings for me, then forcibly kissed me when I rejected him. I wanted you to know what happened so we can make a plan to avoid him and I being alone together again.""

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Just wanted to add, it was not your fault at all. He's a creep who ignores when a woman says no to his advances."
15,"That's great news!

&gt; Someone said ""If you relationship cant handle a wedding postpone, your relationship wont handle a marriage"" and i think hes absolutly right. If she leaves me now, im 100% sure it was the right choice.

The fact that you were so hesitant, the fact that you would prefer breaking-up than marrying her, and the fact that you feel so relieved are all the confirmation you need that you made the right choice. Tons of relationships don't survive going back on that kind of commitment, if she choses to leave you now, it says nothing about her."
16,"It's extraordinarily difficult to watch the ones you love decline, but don't let this prevent you from spending as much time with him as you possibly can. When my mother was in her final stages of life I inadvertently avoided interactions because they were so painful - now that she's no longer here I'd give everything to spend those last moments with her. 
It's not going to be easy, but i'm sure your presence brings him some degree of comfort. If you can, muscle through it. Make him feel loved while you can. Wishing you the best."
17,"Simple solution. Your boyfriend accepts the money, then doesn't dump you. Dad learns a valuable lesson. "
18,"So no one healthy does this. Whether it's real or fake both point to pretty severe mental health issues. 

I'd play that angle. Start really pushing the therapy idea. I mean at one point someone said it gave him a heart attack? He's frequently going to hospital. 

For what it's worth it sounds fake and a way for him to stay central in your lives and feel cared for and listened to. So give him that but on therapy terms 'Dad I can't watch you suffer. It's hurting everyone. The hospital trips aren't helping. Go to therapy.' And try and get everyone on board? "
19,"Nope. Not before she talks to a lawyer. 

No one should know anything before she talks to her divorce lawyer. 

OP, the wives will find out, you can speak to them later, right now you need to think of yourself first. A lawyer will help you protect your assets before he knows anything. You have so much evidence, this divorce is going to go well for you if you play your cards right. He‚Äôs proven himself to be utterly unreliable, and untrustworthy. Who knows what else he‚Äôs capable of, or if he has secret account for his own money, etc. The double life could go so deep. Get your affairs sorted first.

Protect yourself legally. Plan your escape/ leaving to time with the closing off of joint accounts, etc. Then take care of your health. STD and blood tests. The whole thing. Counselling, especially. 

Cut him off but do it right. Don‚Äôt let your emotions get the better of you. There will be time enough later to confront him and get the answers you seek. 

"
20,"Man, everytime I see one of these threads, it just breaks my heart. Granted, he didn't go as far as some people do (that we know of), but I just don't understand how someone could be so backhanded and betray someone they're in a loving relationship with. "
21,You start off by growing a spine and evicting her. She has shown unbelievable disrespect to you and your home. Ignore the inevitable tantrums and stop letting her take advantage of you. 
22,"I agree with the others who are saying to tell what you wrote in your post, but there is one other angle I was wondering about. 

So is the item in question something that your family legitimately couldn't afford and/or that you have no use for, or is is something that your family has the money for and you'd be able to use, but the idea of the particular amount involved causes you to have irrational anxiety over the expenditure?"
23," **tl;dr** they're all just fucking each other and selling weed. Crisis and drama averted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Roger that."
24,I think you should stop accepting invites. I honestly would die of embarrassment if it were me. 
25,"I am glad you did that, because I would like someone to tell me if my SO was cheating on me or looking for other people to date."
26,"Woah. That‚Äôs... a lot. As bad as it is, I think you might just want to focus on laying low for a while. She‚Äôs making those posts because she wants you to respond, and she no doubt will take anything you say and twist it into you being the bad guy. 

The people who you‚Äôre friends with, and who know you will be able to accurately judge the situation, and stand by you. 

The only thing that you could possibly (maybe? i‚Äôm very unsure about this) do is report her for slander or harassment if it escalates to her messaging you with threatening messages, or her doxxing you on twitter. 

edited: fixing bad phrasing"
27,"This. 

It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs preparing for the end already. You don‚Äôt say things like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get drinks if this doesn‚Äôt work out‚Äù if you‚Äôre in a committed relationship. To me, it sounds like he‚Äôs already thinking of a future without you. Or he‚Äôs considered one without you. 

And like the comment above, do you really want to be confined to a home by yourself forever? What do YOU want for YOU? 

I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with this. There‚Äôs not much detail about how the rest of your relationship is with him, but if you think it‚Äôs worth salvaging, then I would try to talk to him about how you feel - or try couples counseling. You‚Äôll be able to tell by his reactions/what he says where your relationship stands "
28,"Absolutely send this shit to the other wives. 

I‚Äôm so sorry. "
29,"""I can't afford to feed two men. Learn to cook.""
"
30,"1. You shouldn't let anyone dictate whether you can and cannot use toys alone

2. He needs to focus more on you in foreplay, have you suggested oral sex to him? Or taking more time for fingering?

3. The more he shames you for not having an orgasm, the harder it could be (anxiety). Sit down with him and have a serious conversation about it. Communication is key!

I hope you resolve this! "
31,"Be relieved, you've dodged a major bullet. Imagine finding this out 30 years from now. Take your friend Gwen to dinner and tell her how much you appreciate her saving your life."
32,"She wants acknowledgement and reassurance and support.  So, you are going to give that to her, but not in the way she expects.  You tell her, ""You are carrying a lot of worries and anxieties and I care about that.  I care so much that i have realized that I am doing you a massive disservice.  I realize that I do not have the proper skills nor the time to listen to you and help you in the way that you need best.  I think that a lot of this might connected to your grief and I urge you to seek a grief counselor or someone who can you hear you out with the proper skills.  I am just worried that I am steering you wrong because I can't support you in the ways that you need.  What's worse is I have been distracting you from your work by encouraging us to talk too much at the wrong times.  I would feel awful if we got in trouble for not doing our jobs.  So, I am going to have to dial this back because I fear I am turning into the wrong listener for your concerns.""  Maybe even have a few numbers ready of grief groups.  An approach like this will hopefully cushion any feelings of rejection because, although telling her to bug off is a completely legit response, you do have to work with her afterwards and don't need unnecessary drama from a chatty cathy who's all butthurt that her favorite shoulder to cry on got too soggy to hold her up anymore."
33,How often does she flip her shit on you about stuff that doesn't matter in the long run?
34,"You end the relationship, then you tell the wife. "
35,"Anyone else want to know what the gift was?
Anyone ..... just me ....
Ok"
36,"If dad were here telling his side of the story, I'd have a novel of advice to give him. For you, just stop showing up. The second hand embarrassment was real for this post. Mom acts like a fucking nanny scolding a child toward her husband, someone who's supposed to be her equal, and dad has apparently been abused into complacency about it. "
37,"Great advice, thank you! I don't think I've really stressed how important and meaningful to me wearing a ring is to him yet. My parents never loved each other and were miserable, but stayed together for my sake. They never wore their rings except for big events/to see family so I guess it's a bit of a sore spot for me when I see that my husband isn't wearing his. "
38,"Some of the answers on this thread are trying so hard to not cause any kind of offence and be super supportive of the husband that I think they are overlooking how OP must feel.

Should OP‚Äôs husband be able to live the life that she wants and feels she needs to?

Absolutely.

Is OP allowed to feel absolutely shattered and betrayed that the life she thought she was having and the future she envisioned is now most likely gone?

Absolutely.

There is no right and wrong here only 2 hurting people. 


OP - I think you need to go to therapy together (maybe?) and separately. Maybe start with having a bit of a break, including from living together, so your husband can more freely explore living as a woman without feeling as though you are watching and/or judging her (not that I‚Äôm saying that you would be judging) and you can both sort out your thoughts a bit.

Don‚Äôt let anyone try to tell you that not staying together means you are transphobic or anything of the sort, it doesn‚Äôt. It just means that your life is no longer compatible together."
39,Why did you go through with the wedding?
40,"Everyone only wants to get married once. 

Let me tell you a quick story. My mother got married at 22 and divorced at 25. By the end of the marriage, she was praying that he‚Äôd be hit by a car so she wouldn‚Äôt have to be a divorcee (this was the 70s, and there was a lot more stigma to it than there is now). Eventually she worked up the courage to tell him that it wasn‚Äôt working and left. 

She met my dad during the one year separation before the divorce was finalized. They got married a couple years later, had three kids, and have been happily married for 42 years. 

There‚Äôs no shame in saying, ‚Äúyou know what? I was young, I made a mistake, and I‚Äôm going to fix it rather than spend the rest of my life paying for it.‚Äù"
41,How was this girl invited to the birthday? Why was she not sent away when you saw her there?  Your boyfriend needs to set some firmer boundaries because it clearly didn't work.
42,"He pretty much told you that under certain circumstances cheating is normal and expected. What is he going to do at *his* bachelor party, if you get that far? "
43,Leaving him would send the message pretty clearly.
44,"After much thinking, and taking into account the toxicity of the relationship, and all of your advice, I went ahead and changed my number... but I just didn‚Äôt give her my new number, I‚Äôm leaving everything in the past now, even her. Thank you guys so much. Seriously, the outpouring means so much to me.  "
45,"I'm glad to see this update, I was curious how this would turn out :)"
46,"&gt;I'm not really sure how to approach this topic anymore. I've talked to him about this multiple times and it's always just been ""it's uncomfortable"", ""it doesn't fit well"", ""I'm afraid to lose it/I always fidget with it""

I would believe him when he says that.

&gt;The only redeeming factor in all of this is that he still wears this necklace made out of amethyst that I made him when I went through a jewlery-making phase when I was 18. He wears it every single day and doesn't even take it off to shower

Is it possible to add the ring on to that or make the ring it's own necklace?"
47,"""Entertainment"" doesn't mean sex with an escort. For my buddy's bachelor party we went to a NFL game then had a bunch of beers and wings after. Entertaining, and no one cheated on anyone. Don't let him convince you his behavior was normal. "
48,Usually you can silence group chats so they don't notify you. Then you can check at your leisure.
49,"Special education teacher here. I work with teenagers with disabilities and I have often helped my students navigate through these kinds of social situations. I agree with the advice about going to a counselor but I wanted to add that it is ok to be a little blunt in your interactions with her. Many individuals with disabilities don‚Äôt understand subtleties in social situations and attempts to be kind or tactful end up coming across as confusing or unclear. A non-accusatory statement like ‚ÄúWow, I am really enjoying spending time with you but I do not want to be in a relationship. Thank you for letting me be your friend. I think you‚Äôre really cool.‚Äù lets her know where the two of you stand without putting the negative focus on her (ie, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to date‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to date *you*‚Äù). Then in the future, if any comments are made, you can refer back to this statement. ‚ÄúNo, remember, I said I don‚Äôt want to date. I meant it.‚Äù  

I would also like to say thank you. The kindness of students that interact with my kids are one of the best things about my job. There are a million different ways you are making this world a better place, by setting an example for others and by showing kindness to your fellow human beings, to name a couple. Every day you are choosing to make someone‚Äôs life happier and better and I don‚Äôt have the words to express what that means. Please remember though that choosing kindness shouldn‚Äôt come at the expense of your boundaries and comfort zone and if this girl can‚Äôt respect those, you have the right to put some distance between you. I hope everything works out well for both of you. "
50,"&gt; shrinks are for crazy people

Guess what dad?  You're a crazy person.  Sane people don't start convulsing and screaming in public.  Crazy people do that.  So off to the shrink you go."
51,"I can see both sides. You should for sure live alone. That experience is  necessary! But after 2.5 years, I can also see her being upset that you're getting your own place and don't want her there for a whole 'nother year. 

So, three and a half years later, and you're still not living together. What's the timeline? She needs some reassurance, I think, that there's a plan, or a future here. (Hey, some people move slow, some people don't.) "
52,If he‚Äôs going to do it anyways dump him. 
53,"So your girlfriend wants to erase you past.  This is the tip of iceberg that indicates a controlling, abusive personality.   Let her leave."
54,"It sounds like you're something of a novelty item for her? Because yeah, encouraging someone to get local clothes so they don't look like a tourist walking around is one thing, but making fun of your accent and the thing about the car are different, more mean-spirited is how they come across to me. "
55,"No, you're just doing it *differently*, not wrong. You didn't do anything wrong here. You need to learn to differentiate, between what's actually wrong and what someone thinks is wrong. Just because someone thinks it's the ""right way"" doesn't make it the only way to do something.

(I like what someone below said, you could literally have been painting giant d!cks on the wall and it wouldn't matter)

In this case, there is literally no incorrect way to paint ""in a w"", in fact it's literally just the way you cross your roller, size, paint amount, etc. Doesn't change how the process worked. She was just being a control freak.

You sound conditioned to be abused :( 

Start calling her out.

Also please listen to the advice of those who have replied to my comment, they added a lot of insight that I didn't include in my response."
56,"You and your girlfriend need to be presenting a united front against him. You should talk over with her what she wants to do about it, how she thinks the two of you should tackle the situation. In general I would say you both need to enforce boundaries with him, both shut him down if he says or does anything inappropriate. Neither of you should be alone with him, to prevent him misrepresenting what either of you have said or done.

You could also both just cut him out of your lives completely, but there may be collateral damage, so it depends whether you're willing to risk losing other friends who might take his side.

Other than that, try not to let this impact how you treat your girlfriend. If you start getting annoyed with her or start mistrusting her then that will drive a wedge between the two of you, giving Alex the break up he wants."
57,"&gt;How do I help him understand how these things aren't okay?

Girl, come on now. He's almost 30 years old, he understands just fine. He just doesn't care. Having a laugh is more important to him than your feelings. Throw this one back and move on. There are plenty of men out there who are perfectly sweet and also not immature jackasses. "
58,"I was going to say. I‚Äôve broken an engagement before, so I‚Äôve watched this happen.
You, OP, have just dropped a hammer on her. You couldn‚Äôt go through with marrying her. Now this is a very mature choice and I agree with you 100%, but the message for her here is that *you don‚Äôt want to be married to her.* 

If she has a hard time with that, you *can‚Äôt* blame her. That‚Äôs the kind of shit that would break anyone‚Äôs confidence, you included, I guarantee it, because let‚Äôs be real. This is a super painful thing to hear in any context. If you two have any hope of ever speaking again, you need to have a massive amount of empathy for her and drop any and all blame you have for her for making whatever choice is best for her at this point.  

If she leaves you now, you do nothing but understand and wish the best for her. You did what‚Äôs best for you, it‚Äôs only fair you give her her turn, especially after the amount of pain I guarantee you caused her. Be honest to yourself about this.

My ex-fianc√© and I had been close friends since high school and broke up once before and reconnected but we haven‚Äôt spoken in over a year now. I don‚Äôt expect him to ever want to speak with me again at this point and *that‚Äôs completely fair*, because I broke his heart with a giant hammer, and I accept that, because you can‚Äôt be mad someone‚Äôs hurt when you hurt them."
59,"this! start charging. if they ask for some of your food, say ""sure, 5 bucks"". see what they say, if they question you or complain, throw it back at them ""are you seriously complaining that I don't buy you food and cook it for you?"""
60,"You are not obligated to give them space in your life. 

I cannot fucking believe they didn't tell you your *sister* died. The fact that you're so conflicted in how to respond to this (plus the 'my family is strange'), this screams to me that you have been subject to this behavior your whole life and you don't know what's 'normal.' 

Here's what a 'normal' family would do: 

**Immediately tell you that your sister died.** Not make you feel *guilty* for being hurt that you were informed. They would be supportive in your grief, and would be grieving themselves.

Again, you only have this one life (and I'm sure the death of your sister is a *stark* reminder). You do not owe **anyone** space in it. "
61,"You get free counseling through Military One Source. 13 free sessions per family member per issue. Use it even if you have to Uber. You need it beyond the marital stuff. 

Whose actual car is it? Yours? Tell him he needs to buy his own. And base will have a bazillion dealerships that will give him financing. Just buy something reasonable not a mustang. Do not co-sign. 

Lastly, there are things to do. Even at Yuma or El Centro. Before I joined the military myself I was married to a cheating Marine. I worked out like crazy at the free gym that was walking distance. I found an online community of like minded military spouses (ie not lunatics obsessed with their spouse‚Äôs jobs) and made great friends. Then I enlisted and later commissioned into a different branch and now I outrank my ex which is not why I did it but it sure doesn‚Äôt hurt. 

You‚Äôre going to be okay. No matter what. Become your own person. I get wanting kids, but you can live life for a while first. Become your own person first. If you have kids, is this the relationship you want to model for them? Make yourself the mother you want for them. Tough as nails, independent, in a trusting and loving partnership. "
62,"Obviously taking the money and not breaking up is not going to happen, and shouldn't happen. My daughter brought home guys I didn't think too much of. I was right about a few, wrong about a few. She came from college one time with a guy who I thought, aside from him being a Lakers fan, was awesome. Good, successful family, good looking guy, polite and engaging, good head on his shoulders and obviously on his way to a good career. Dude ended up being a douchebag. Two points, first, parents don't know shit about picking partners for their kids and second, she learned something about herself and dealing with relationships with each one. I completely trust her judgement and even when she was younger and dating, I trusted that we had raised a women who valued herself and would never settle for someone who didn't value her equally as much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if this really happened, I'll give you some real advice. The point of all of this is to tell you that I think you should call your dad when you calm down. The first thing you tell him is that he embarrassed you, disrespected you, belittled you, and objectified you...made you feel like a piece of property. Then ask him how he would feel if you dated a guy who did those same things to you. Ask him he would think of a guy that treated you like he owned you, who objectified you and saw you as a thing and not a bright and independent young woman, because that is what he and your mother raised. Tell him that as demented as his action was, you can somehow see it was coming from some place where he thinks he is doing what is in your best interest. But all he is doing is demeaning you and telling you that he raised a a helpless idiot who is incapable of making her own decisions. Maybe he's right and time will reveal that the boyfriend isn't the right guy, but YOU get to make that decision and in making it, you will grow as a person. Because you are much more mature than he is and you obviously respect him far more than he does you, you are going to give him this one opportunity to apologize and move forward and until he does, you won't be speaking with him or coming home. And if he ever does anything like this again, your relationship with him will essentially cease. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't bring up the boyfriend and how awesome he is and how your dad doesn't know him. This is about you and your dad. Keep the boyfriend completely out of this first conversation. Just one dad's advice. Best of luck. "
63,"‚ÄúBoss, I understand why you want us to check in at the end of our work day, &amp; I have no problem doing so. I also appreciate that you want to check on me when you know I‚Äôm unwell or have had a difficult appointment; however, once I‚Äôm home for the evening, part of my routine is to stop checking my phone regularly, so I may not respond to those texts in a timely manner. I don‚Äôt want you to worry about me, so I‚Äôll check in at the end of my work day, but I may not see other messages until the next morning.‚Äù"
64,"Seems like you're putting together a list of all the things you just can't do with your girlfriend because she yells and criticizes you: painting, baking, and putting together furniture. Sure, this strategy works for awhile - but is is a band-aid. Soon there will be nothing you CAN do together since your list will be so long! The problem is her, not the tasks you're doing. This does not sound like a good or healthy relationship, and since you mention you have a history of getting easily overwhelmed/upset and crying, I wonder if you've had other figures in your life treat you like this (perhaps a teacher, parent, or boss) and this is why you simply accept this treatment? This is not normal or loving treatment. 

I'm a very sensitive person and cute cat videos make me cry...but I would not put up with is my partner making me cry, then berating me for being upset. I'm sorry you're going through this. "
65,This is...strangely wholesome for an update on r/relationships that involves weed and non-monogamy. Excellent and I'm glad it's only kind of awkward and not a crisis.
66,He sounds more like some sort of a fratboy son rather than a life partner.
67,"Let your boyfriend fend for himself. I know it is hard to turn off that part if the brain that is like ""cooking=love"", but your boyfriend is going to drive you out of your tree with that nonsense. So until he can meet you halfway, just excuse yourself from the task and do what you enjoy for an appreciative audience. Just tell him that you aren't going to continue cooking because it isn't something that is making either of you happier."
68,"You should ask how his night was and what he got up to, I feel like it would be worth gauging ( As hard as it would be to hear ) how much of a liar your fiance is before confronting to avoid getting possibly manipulated. I hope it's all a misunderstanding and that thing's work out OP!"
69,"You‚Äôre not responsible for feeding him, or watching his nutrition, etc. He‚Äôs an adult. Let him cook for himself. "
70,"It'll blow over.  I'd start repeating a script to everyone though.  ""I was at work, and I did what my boss told me to do."""

72,"&gt;&gt;He was charged, tried and convicted of raping his ex-wife. Everyone involved believes this is a false claim. I mostly believe he is falsely accused.

Most rape cases don't go to trial. It's nearly extraordinary that he was tried and convicted. Why the presumption of innocence for a man who has been tried and convicted?

I'm sure the court would be verrrrry interested in a child custody case in which the partner of one of the parents is a convicted rapist."
73,"Your mother has NO business putting this on you.  It's a gutless move to foist her responsibilities off on you.  Is there any kind of court order regarding custody or visitation?  Because if there is, she's about to find herself in contempt.  You have TWO parents, not one parent and one guy you sort of visit once in a while.  What the hell is she thinking?  If you do choose to tell him, just tell him the truth.  Tell him your mother is moving you to D.C. and that she didn't have the guts to tell him herself.  Then back away and let them handle it between themselves.  They're the adults, that's their job.  Nobody has the right or the justification to put this kind of pressure on you."

95,"OP I hope you read this. My father is a convicted rapist, on the registry and all of it. He raped my mom in a fury one night after beating the absolute shit out of her and the ONLY reason he didn‚Äôt get away with it is because I crawled out of a window with my sister and called the police from a neighbors house. He served less than 2 years. 

Do NOT assume Josh is not guilty. HE IS GUILTY. There is no way in hell that a married man would be convicted of raping his wife without, bare minimum, evidence of violence (holes in the walls, broken things, bruises/scratches). It is extremely hard to prove marital rape, so I‚Äôd bet everything I had there was, at BARE MINIMUM, violence in that home. Minimum. But with a conviction, I‚Äôd say you should be convinced of his guilt as a rapist. Don‚Äôt listen to his sob story about his ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù ex wife and custody. It has been 25 years and my father has complained to ME about my ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù mom and how she ‚Äúpushed him‚Äù to this or that and I was literally FUCKING THERE and know exactly what happened. When he interviews, he says his ex wife was bitter at him for leaving and lied to police. When he meets people and they find out, he says she did it for money and the judicial system isn‚Äôt fair (because my mom is white and my father is black).

Everyone who meets my dad loves him. He seems so great. He‚Äôs extremely friendly and kind, but he‚Äôs fucking delusional and abusive. No one knows it until they‚Äôre the subject of it. Do not allow your child to be exposed to this man. Many average people seem wonderful at first blush but turn out to be abusive without being convicted felons. Anyone can be a great or shitty person, but recognize this is 100 red flags at once. 

By the time you realize something is wrong, your son will have already been damaged by this man or by this relationship. Your ex wife has accepted Josh. The fact she is willing to accept this risk to her son screams to me. Would she leave Josh at the first sign of abusive behavior? I doubt it. Not if she was willing to put this rape thing aside for him already. Do not let your son be exposed to this huge risk. Rape is a violent act. Rapists are violent people. Get a lawyer NOW and tell them you do not want your son living in a home or in contact with a convicted rapist. 

Protect you son from this unnecessary risk. If you and his mother fail to do this and Josh does turn out to be a scumbag (very likely as he is a convicted rapist), he will resent you both for a very long time. "
96,"I think you should forget the weight stuff for now. Approach it from a different angle. ""Mom, you just don't seem very happy. Maybe you could see a therapist or a doctor.""

She sounds quite depressed, and when you are depressed, especially if you are also overweight and feeling hopeless about that, you have so much less energy to do the things that would make you feel less depressed, like going for walks, going on trips, making healthy food etc.

She probably feels like it is far beyond her control to lose weight, in her current state of mind. So every time you bring it up, she may feel more helpless and bad about it, hence shutting the conversation down so she doesn't have to deal with those negative emotions. So deal with the emotional side. Her mental health should really be assessed by a professional, and therapy could help her gain back the confidence to take small steps to improving her life beyond ""go to work"" and ""be on the couch"".

OP, I'm so sorry. I've been in your position very recently so I'll try to advise what's been helping me. 


For me, 5 year relationship, marriage talk, all the good stuff. I found the pictures and texts (accidentally) that proved his long term affair. 


Right now, you're broken. You don't know what to think, and you're probably trying to make excuses for him. You want him to come back, say it wasn't what it looked like, and you want to ignore your gut and believe him because you love him so much. 


Don't do it. Don't listen to the excuses. I did. I accepted his lies for months and it just tore me apart when I finally accepted the truth. It broke me. 



You'll get through it. I promise you will. Disentangle yourself immediately. It's going to hurt like no pain you've ever felt before, but do it. 


I gave it two days of tears and heartbreak, then I bagged up his belongings and dumped them and his keys at his place, and went home. I love his mom so I told her the truth (actually my sister did because I couldn't bring myself to hurt her, but it was done anyway), she and I chatted, I thanked her for everything and then I cut all contact with every member of his family and him too. 

I threw out things that he gave me, I tore up our vacation photos. And I never contacted him. 

It's only been a month for me. A short time. And of course I still love him. Of course I miss him. But missing having a confidante, a super close friend, someone to talk to all the time, I miss that more than him, because I'm fucking furious at him. 


But I'm happy ish. I'm coping. I'm keeping as busy as possible and I'm reminding myself every single day of the GOOD in my life. And I told my family and friends why it ended, because by telling them I know I can never ever go back. He's shacked up with his affair partner now anyway. 


Do all of the above. Please. It's hard. It's the hardest thing you'll probably ever have to do. It destroyed me but I forced myself to do it. 

I'm healing now. And you will too, if you force yourself to do the above. It hurts, it's hard, you won't eat, you won't sleep, you'll have nightmares and you'll struggle not to cry in work. But it'll help hugely, I promise you.

127,"Yep, that explains it. It seems like you normalized your father's verbal abuse and controlling nature, assuming that that's just what love looks like. It isn't. That is hateful behavior and you don't deserve to be treated like that. You deserve to be lifted up and cherished by the people in your life."

A few months/casual dating and you either have to get used to it or walk away. But if you guys are long term and serious, that‚Äôs a pretty big thing to do secretly. I‚Äôd never ask my husband for permission to get a new tattoo but I would definitely talk with him about it first.

It will be a fight for a while, but you, your mom and dad have to set boundaries and make this kid do what is best.  Next, talk to the sister.  Tell her she needs to take more responsibility.  If you don't get days off, neither does she.  If she isn't working, she has the kids.  Life is hard, she needs to do her fair share, cause God knows, yall are doing more than your fair share. "

He was also very cruel to his friend. Pressuring someone to have sex is not a kind act, and will have had an impact on his friend's relationship and set a shaky foundation on their marriage. Absolutely immoral behaviour from bf.  "
137,"It's pretty obvious to me that this relationship is much, much more important to you than to him.  Absolutely nothing he does implies that you're actually important to him, and it doesn't take a stranger on the internet to tell you that you deserve better.

&amp;#x200B;

The bottom line as I see it is that you are quite certain that you want more, that you've expressed your disappointment to him, and that he's not only heard it but turned around and outright ignored and dismissed it.  He puts off seeing you, goes out of his way to separate you from his personal/family life, breaks plans with you, always determines the circumstances of your hang-outs, etc. You are only a girlfriend because you're calling yourself that, but nothing in the nature of your relationship or how he treats you speaks ""girlfriend"" and you absolutely DO sound just like a side-chick.  It sounds incredibly one-sided. Honestly it sounds like the guy is just avoiding breaking up with you because he's either afraid of the drama or he's getting something else out of it (are you two intimate when he comes by?)

The only rational thing to do here is to stand up for yourself and break up with him. Having strong feelings for him is even more of a reason to break up, because he's not matching them you don't want to give yourself time to nurture those feelings that are going to go completely unrequited. Are you staying ""with"" him (I say that in quotes because there is very little in your dynamic that is couple-like at all) because you're afraid to be alone?  You've romanticized having feelings for him?  Take some time to reflect on WHY you feel so attached and are willing to accept this kind of treatment, and then even more time reminding yourself of why you deserve better.  No guy that treats you like this is worth the time for you to even think there is something to fix.

Feeling sad about the idea of breaking up is normal, but that doesn't mean it's wrong.  It's just part of life.  Move on."
138,"Hey I was a chef for many years and I know where you‚Äôre coming from. 

I love to cook and love to feed people. But in my personal life the minute I go from being a benefactor to a servant I get uncomfortable/resentful and that is poison to such a beautiful and pure thing like cooking. And it sounds to me like they‚Äôre trying to slide you into the role of personal cook. Albeit in a very pathetic and annoying way. 

Even though cookery should have an element of generosity, as a cook you can‚Äôt allow your contribution to be devalued. Be a Chef and take charge. 

Tell them that you‚Äôre thinking of cooking something and ask if they want in. Then set the parameters. Maybe they have to buy wine or beer or a nice cheese for desert? Or they need to help out with prep or cleaning, or physically go and get the ingredients. These are subtle ways of putting a price on your culinary and creative efforts. Then when they sob about not getting any, they only have themselves to blame. You can say ‚Äòwell I asked if you wanted to help with the meal‚Äô

Also don‚Äôt just let them only pay for ingredients and then have you cook. That makes you their employee (spiritually) and they can complain. It sounds mercenary but trust me on this. Make them work or contribute in some way on top of money: time, effort, something. And then take charge of directing those efforts. 

They will either rise to this challenge or shy away from it. Either way you‚Äôve quashed this passive aggressive bullshit. 
It‚Äôs no accident that chef means chief in French. Be a Chef, Chef. 

That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve handled it in the past anyway. Good luck with your situation and your cooking.

140,"This is excellent advice. But you also need to schedule your time so that you can decompress and keep yourself sane.

Work out something with your family, and express it to your brother as well. E.g., ""I'm going to the shops to get some things for mum - I'll check in with you when I get back."" Take it in turns to sit with him. Also, you can do a lot by just sitting quietly without trying to talk.

I remember when my dad was dying that the best thing was to work as a team. It helps everyone, including the medics and nurses. 

ETA: people are saying 'spend every moment you can with him', but that doesn't mean every single moment there is. Look after yourself and your family too."

However, if her husband bought something they can't fit into their budget, that's maybe not great and worth a discussion. Perhaps a cap on how much they can spend on gifts. "

&gt; If she didn't get to hold the baby on a particular visit, she was visibly sulky and disappointed 

Sucks for her, not your problem.

&gt; I'm torn between thinking I need to let her know more clearly that she is being intrusive (evidently being subtle and just making excuses as to why she can't come around isn't doing the trick), and just putting my big girl pants on and tolerating it for the sake of keeping the peace with the family 

See, you're missing secret option 3 - just start saying no *all the time*, being less available. You don't have to make a stand, you don't have to make excuses, you don't have to tolerate it. ""I'm afraid it's not a good day today, sorry!"" She might pout and moan, just become a broken record. She might tell you/others that you're keeping the baby away from her, or similar, and if anyone brings it up to you directly, replies can range from ""I'm doing what's best for our family, she's not a toy"" through to ""well, recovery is being a bit slow and visits take it out of me"". If it's not brought up to you directly, ignore any tantrums entirely.

If she makes a fuss and causes drama/family upset, **she's** the one doing that, not you. You don't owe her visits, even if she was a lovely person, which she clearly isn't. It's not your job to keep the peace by making yourself unhappy. Or even if it is, it's **equally** her job to keep the peace but not making **you** unhappy! Anyone reasonable will understand that she's not entitled to drop by all the time, and anyone unreasonable...can fuck off, bluntly."
144,"&gt;I left him 4 years ago for how angry he was getting all the time, I left for a year during this time he said he was going to kill himself and had a breakdown then his mom died of a heart attack and he literally couldn‚Äôt handle it. I took him back because I couldn‚Äôt bare the thought of him killing himself. 

But you were gone for a year and he DIDN'T kill himself. That was pure manipulation, and you fell for it. 

Also, you guys got together when you were 18 and he was 27. There has ALWAYS been a power imbalance in this relationship. "
145,"&gt; but was more upset that he could hear her trash-talking the engagement ""ten feet from his bed"", in his ""own house"" which he ""pays for equally"". 

Okay? You pay for it equally too. It's not ""his house"" any more than it's ""your house"". He's free to be critical of you in discussions with his friends as well.

I mean, the fucking nerve to demand complete privacy and secrecy on this topic, and then refuse to grant you privacy in your *bathroom*.

&gt; Plus, ever since I‚Äôve known my roommate (1 year), he‚Äôs always been pretty rude towards my girlfriend, which I think exaggerated why she had an animated reaction. 

Honestly, he seems like an asshole. I would just move out.

&gt; I'm wondering how it should be addressed.

Let him make his own dumbass decisions, and let him deal with the natural consequences of them. Some people refuse to not touch a stove until they've burned their hand."
146,"I don't think *you* can do anything, because he's the person with the problem. I would actually advise you to stop being so careful around him and stop walking on eggshells. 

Also, he's going to do this to your child, and that's really not acceptable. It's one thing to subject yourself to a moody asshole, it's quite another to subject a small child to that treatment. If he can't get himself together I think you need to leave."
147,"To all the people saying ""call them by their middle name"" or ""hyphenate"", I am a child whose name was a compromise my parents made and I hate every bit of it. I go by a shortened version of my middle name and every form, every teacher in school, every work email is a headache. 

Say my name is Sarabeth Margaret [Last Name], my parents knew before I was even born, they would call me Maggie. I am now in the process of legally changing my name so that I can be rid of their indecisiveness once and for all.

Compromise sounds like the right thing to do, but neither you nor your husband will have to bear the consequences of what you name your child. I also think family names are bullshit and like another person said, putting the burden of your BIL's memory on your son is a terrible thing to do."
148,"I think all you can do is individually address people as they text you - I'm sorry she's putting everyone in the position to take sides.  I did not bully or abuse her.  She developed a problem with drinking and Xanax and we just weren't working out anymore.  I hope she gets the help she needs.  

Be neutral, state your case, short and to the point.  They don't believe you?  I'm really sorry you feel that way.  I hope she gets the help she needs.  And then let it go.




"
149,"This actually made me really upset just to read. 

What a horribly manipulative person. You sound like a nice guy and she likely hated you for losing weight and bettering yourself so she wanted to bring you down. 

What a cruel fucking person that is. "

151,Do you think he was kind to his friend‚Äôs now wife? What do you think he‚Äôs going to do at his own bachelor party? At bachelor parties he goes to in the future? 
152,"Early 20s...""We got a house on base"" ... i think we all know where this is headed. Cut your losses, best of luck."
153,"I'm not sure there's any way to come back from this, to be honest. Your fiancee is openly flirting with other men which crosses the line from ""am I doing the right thing?"" to ""I am not doing the right thing and I'm going to explore my other options without even telling my SO I'm having doubts"". If you do wed, you will always be paranoid and she will most likely always be questioning whether she did in fact settle for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for the 'I can't lose you' comment, this could either be Sunk Cost Fallacy or her stringing you along whilst she gets her head sorted out. Both are bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

You need to put a halt on the wedding, right now. I'd normally recommend Couple's Counselling to see if you can work through this but the fact that she's already started flirting with other men is...not good. She didn't have enough confidence in your relationship to come to you; she's jumped straight to looking at other people. If that friend hadn't sent you those screenshots, she would likely have never told you her real feelings :/ "
154,"1. If you have to hide a relationship, you‚Äôre not ready to get married.

2. Three months isn‚Äôt enough time to get to know someone well enough for a lifetime commitment.

3. It was very stupid of him to tell you via text if he wanted to keep it a secret.

4. If he didn‚Äôt realize you would tell your GF he doesn‚Äôt understand relationships enough to get married.

You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, he‚Äôs being an idiot."
155,"I know you don't want to give off the impression that you're a cold hearted jerk to these guy, but that is exactly what they are trying to take advantage of. Your willingness to cave in so people think you're nice. I say keep doing what you're doing. Let their guilt tripping roll off you like water on a duck. LET THEM BE MAD! It is not your problem. "
156,"You're focusing on the comfort object itself, rather than why your son might need more comfort than others. 

It's unlikely that he forgot to detach from his bunny - he seems to be using it to cope with genuine distress. Much better to use a bunny than booze or drugs, and he seems to have the social awareness to keep it on the downlow.

When I was a child in undiagnosed pain (physical in my case) I did things my parents didn't understand, as a way of coping. I didn't know I was experiencing something unusual, and my parents focused on stopping the behaviour rather than finding out why. We both ended up thinking I was weak and weird, which was of absolutely no help in dealing with my condition as it worsened.

If your son is in pain of some sort, do you recognise that and sympathise with him? What is his therapist telling you about his situation? Have you asked her what support your son might need in future?"
157,"I like that angle. I plan on sitting down with my wife after work to talk about approaching either my dad or siblings later in the week. 

He tried therapy after the divorce but hated it and won't go back. He says, ""shrinks are for crazy people. I don't want to go talk with someone who labels me."" He thinks he needs Xanax to calm down but his GP gives him counseling referrals. My dad and family focus on the breathing techniques and minimizing dad's stress approach. But if I say something along the lines of its not working and I'm worried and so are his grandchildren maybe he will go. "
158,"So let me get this straight...

- You are in immense pain, go to the doctor for hours, and are diagnosed with internal hemorrhaging. Mandated bedrest.

- Boyfriend doesn't come with you to the doctor, doesn't offer to drive you  to the hospital, doesn't express concern.

- Boyfriend refuses to bring you food, refuses to help you in any activities

- Boyfriend brings friends to YOUR PLACE after you expressly asked him not to, in the middle of the night, when you're in a lot of pain and unwell.

Girl. 

Sit back and thing about this really critically: is this the kind of man you want to spend the rest of your life with? Like the next 50 years? Do you want to be delivering your child alone, and caring for it alone, while your husband goes out and parties with his dude bros? Do you want to bear the responsibility for caring for both of you, even when you're unwell and he refuses to help himself?

This guy has one good thing going for him: he is showing you his honest self before you are legally bound to him. He doesn't even care about your *diagnosed, physiological health*. Imagine how little concern he will have when you are stressed, or depressed, or hurt (hint: none at all).

Please take care of yourself, and respect yourself. Don't bend over backwards for someone who isn't going to treat you with basic respect and kindness. Please don't wear yourself down over someone who doesn't care. You are valuable and loved and should have someone that treats you as such. "
159,"He might just not like the feel of the ring. Not everyone likes wearing rings. It took me awhile to get used to wearing an engagement ring because I'd never worn rings before, and it sounds like he just finds it uncomfortable. 


Would you want him to tell you that he wants you to wear something every day that you find uncomfortable?


He can look into getting it resized, or buying a ring guard/balls, or replacing it with a silicon band. You should make sure all your rings are insured under your homeowners/renters insurance. If he likes wearing the pendant, maybe he would be happier with the ring on a chain around his neck.


But you might just have to accept that he doesn't like wearing a ring and it is uncomfortable. It's his body."
160,"my gosh, I‚Äôm so sorry you are in this position. I don‚Äôt know what to say.  I don‚Äôt want to badmouth your mom but this is extremely irresponsible.  Can you ask your dad to speak to your mom because ‚ÄúShe has something important to tell him‚Äù?"
161,"I don't know if it's really super often... but this isn't the first time, that's for sure. She has done something similar when we bake together or assemble furniture. Those are things that I let her do alone now."
162,And how often have you held her accountable for her behavior?
163,I'm not sure that a complete lack of respect for your clearly stated boundaries is something that you CAN work through.
164,"I mean this in the nicest way, you simply need to just tell him what you wrote down to a bunch of strangers. If my partner explained it just as you had written it, I‚Äôd completely understand. You‚Äôve already formulated your apology.

Edited spelling "
165,"&gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know any (bio-dad‚Äôs name)‚Äù 
  
Short &amp; to the point.  My opinion may be unpopular, but I don't think you did anything wrong.  You **don't** know him.  &amp;through the great course of your life, he has made no attempt to rectify that.  I'm sure your emotions are all over the place but how else could you have responded.  ""Oh yea, that's my Dad.  He abandoned my Mom &amp; I when I was a baby.""  or ""Yes, we just call him dead-beat in our house.""  Your response was innocuous and it needed to be.  You're a professional in a new career.  You can't jeopardize that.    
  
Unfortunately it seems other people are aware of your relationship and you cannot control their reactions.  But if you continue to keep a professional approach, hopefully it will die off.  "
166,"&gt;He didn't really abuse me 

Can I ask at what point would it count as abuse in your mind? 

Because he's hitting you, and trapping you, and stealing from you, and risking your physical health by cheating on you. What else does he need to do? 

Call your mum to come pick you up. Take everything valuable to you (emotional or monetary) and take pictures of everything else you might leave behind. Don't forget to take paperwork. 

Text him saying he has 1 day to get your keys back to you. 

If he doesn't reply or doesn't give them to you then call the police about the theft of your car keys. Ask for an escort to go collect them (and preferable anything else you might have left at the house)"
167,"It's a really good thing that they're splitting up. Your mom has endured a lot for a long time and tried to make things work, but this was just the final insult to all the injury he's caused her over the years. Your unwell child is at a doctors appointment and you're going to *hit on* one of the people responsible for caring for them? Anyone would divorce him. Your mom is going to be a lot happier and hopefully this will teach your dad to treat others with respect and take care of himself. "
168,"Sounds like a drama queen looking for attention.

169,"Hmm. The issue isn‚Äôt the vibrator or the discussion the vibrator is prompting, it‚Äôs that you‚Äôre this uncomfortable discussing sex and intimacy with a partner you‚Äôve been with for four years. Where are these fears of inadequacy and embarrassment coming from? Why did he say he was ‚Äúupset‚Äù over the vibrator?

What you‚Äôve written here should be perfectly acceptable to share with your husband, you‚Äôve done nothing wrong."

171,I would inform your dad that the boyfriend made a larger counter-offer and you will be dumping him.   He will either get the point and make amends or will prove himself to be someone that should have no influence over your life.
172,"He only does this one or twice a DAY?! I would understand more if it was once a month or something, but he is purposely trying to make you upset daily. And this has been going on for two years? That is super unhealthy for you. You deserve to go a day without someone trying to make you cry. It‚Äôs time to end this relationship. Even if you like him or love him, this relationship is not healthy and is hurting you. "
173,"I am 31 female and in agreement with you.



 I think it's unfair for your wife to ask you to be friends with Jim. I don't understand why your wife is making you be friends with him. 



If you don't want to be friends with him. That should be your choice just like if she wants to be friends with Jane. That should be her choice. If you can't tell your wife who she can and can't be friends with then your wife shouldn't be making you be friends with people you don't want to be friends with.


I am also in agreement with you that from now on your wife should tell you when Jane and Jim come over so you can leave before they arrive. 



I think it's unfair for your wife to expect you to be friends with Jim. I think your duties as a husband is to be polite to her friends but that's it. So far from your story. You sound like you've been nice and polite to Jim so you've done your part."

176,"Yes, exactly. I totally agree with his decision, but that line kind of annoyed me. She just had her entire life (and future) turned upside down, and it's got to feel even worse considering he's been faltering from one side of wanting to marry her to the other for awhile. That line makes it almost seem like ""Well if she can't handle my indecision about marrying her, then this was for the best!"" Yea, it was. But not because she was a bad person or ""couldn't handle the postpone."" Because he wasn't sure about her and she deserves better than that."
177,"Friendships are a two way street. It‚Äôs very possible that they were just busy. 

I wouldn‚Äôt just completely dump your friends just because they didn‚Äôt reach out to you. Maybe reach out to them and see what they‚Äôve been up to. It‚Äôs very possible the could be busy with work/school/etc.

178,"If it were The Rock, we wouldn't be having this issue. The Rock is beloved by one and all.

This is very in line with the thoughts I've been having, thanks."
179,"If she was going in for the same job, and knew it would be the same you were applying for, then i have no idea why she would encourage you to apply. 

I suspect she miscalculated her own odds of getting the job, and wasnt prepared for the emotions of not getting it, and more specifically losing out on it to her husbands best friend. Either that, or didnt realize you were applying for the same position and wasnt prepared to either lose out, or that it would be to you. It sounds to me like regardless of who it was, she would be harbouring bitterness and resentment at not being given the job, but its made even worse by the fact that your also a part of her personal life.

She doesnt sound like she had a firm grasp on what the hiring expectations were, or the education and experience level required, and truly thought that having 8 years at the company would entitle her to the position. Problem is, since finding out she didnt get the position, she has spent no time reflecting and acknowledging it being a miscalculation on her end, and learning from the experience. She has instead spent every day lingering on how the job should have been hers, she could do ""so much better"", and makig her feelings apparent to just about everyone. 

Of course your best friend wouldnt take your side over his wife. Given, your side is fully correct and valid, but this is his life partner, and he is experiencing what shes going through emotionally as the outcome to the denial of the job. 

If you love the job, and its a great position, the answer is to stay and deal with whatever the repercussions on the friendship it might have. Maybe just apologizing to your friend for how hard of a time his wife is having, and restating you had no idea she was vying for the position as well, and never wanted to make either of them feel this way may help. At this point i would be more concerned with how she could effect your ability to work this job to the best ability. Given, i dont know how far she would be willing to take this resentment and bitterness, but i would be at least concerned about her spreading rumors  that could effect your business relationships with coworkers, or succeed in damaging your ability to do your duties to your highest ability. If you feel it would be appropriate, I would talk to your higher up who is over both of you about her behaviors and actions at work related to losing the job to you, and see if they feel it right to address these behaviors before it takes a toll on your career."

No one ever needs to be the cool girl! As soon as I read that comment I was like ‚Äúin what world is it okay to have a profile on social media that you‚Äôre intentionally hiding from your spouse?!‚Äù

185,"Think this through- not washing her hands, after handling meat, for example, is unlikely to just make your tummy hurt afterwards- it would make you SERIOUSLY ill with salmonella or something worse, and maybe put you in the hospital. It seems more likely that you have a sensitive digestive system and perhaps her food segregation practices aren't great or she's still using some ingredient that gives you issues.

190,"You're being very considerate of your mother here. I commend you for keeping this so positive. But this feels like a false equivalency being made. Not wanting kids yourself for the multitude of reasons you cite does not mean you never get to be excited for your loved ones bringing kids into the world. It doesn't mean you don't enjoy kids, don't love the ones that are in your life, don't treasure your time with them. Seeing your BF's son as your 'nephew' is not robbing your mom of anything. 

I also commend your mom for working so hard to make sure you know it is your choice. I'd put the drunken sobfest out of your mind. If she's close with your friend, perhaps she can have a grandmotherly relationship with the little boy (observing boundaries your friend and her family need of course). You have done the right things in talking to your mom about how you feel and not waffling. Do what you need and want to do with your life and do not feel guilty for being ecstatic for your friend and for enjoying her baby. If needed, you may need to have a gentle conversation with your mother that being excited for the baby doesn't mean anything about your feelings about becoming a parent.....that these things aren't in conflict with each other.

191,"Why does your wife believe that Josh was wrongly accused? What story has he given her? What exactly has he said?

Frankly, it is so incredibly rare for rape accusations to even go to trial, which means that the jury saw enough compelling evidence to find Josh guilty.

You are okay with your son hanging out with a convicted rapist. Think about that. You immediately dismissed this woman based on heresay. That‚Äôs scary. 

I would be worried about the lesson that you are both teaching your son, which is people that you guys like can‚Äôt do anything wrong, even if a lot of people said they did. That a woman was lying about being raped, just because you guys are friends/dating with her rapist."

193,"Once I had something similar happen. Maybe this would help. I created a blog (Tumblr is free) and I populated it with screenshots step by step explaining my experience. I did it as logically and as detailed as I could with corroborating evidence, such as texts and etc. I removed all identifying information, but when contacted by people sent my way to spread hate I would link the blog. 

I felt it was a slightly better option than a vaguebook status. It wasn't searchable as I used no names. It wasn't openly posted or shared. And it did the job of defending me.

In my favour I had a lot of incriminating screenshots that did a great job of illustrating what they said was bullplob.  But as an ex I bet you have a lot of texts..."
194,"Sounds like me in the past, and that me was a big old liar. Honestly she shouldn't be sharing your relationship problems with him, that should be between you and her. Secondly it sounds like she likes his flirtyness, otherwise she would have shut him down completely. I'm telling you I WAS this person, this scenario is very familiar to me. I would bet you a million dollars if you two were to break up she'd be with him in less than a month. I'm not trying to sound rude at all either I'm just trying to be as honest as possible."

197,"HPV is not a life long STD, it's incredibly common and often goes away on it's own; approx 80% of sexually active people will get it at some point, and it can remain dormant and be unknowingly transmitted.  Condoms don't fully protect you from HPV, in fact HPV is spread through any sexual activity as it only requires skin-to-skin contact.  Most people clear the infection in 1-2 years and not realize they had it.

What's not clear here is if she knew she had it when you two were together, or if she found out later.  She might have honestly believed she was clean when you two slept together, she might not even be the source [and it's not unlikely you've already had some strain of it and not realized it].  It's good everyone is communicating, but it isn't your friends responsibility to disclose someone else's health status or their responsibility for you to make good decisions on condom usage.  

Edit: FWIW, removing the warts does not get rid of the HPV infection because the virus remains in the body.  While there isn't a cure for the HPV infection, your body [often] gets rid of the infection on it's own."
198,"Communication is very important. You need to be straight forward with them and honest about what bothers you and that you would like them to realize that you are not helpless. Sometimes people just need to be educated about your disability and talk to them about how they can help.

199,Resentment kills relationships and it builds over time. If you are already feeling yourself withdraw from intimacy with this man you guys need to go to counseling now.

200,"&gt;He came after like ten minutes (including foreplay), and was like, ""Wow, how could you not have come??"" 

No. 

&gt;He also makes me feel horrible if I don't orgasm, or puts pressure on me to cum with five minutes of us having sex, which makes it even harder for me to cum.

HELLLL no. 

Firstly, loads of women don't come during PIV. The percentages I've read have varied wildly, but it's very common.

Second, no one is allowed ro make you feel bad for not orgasming. Ever. I could see if he was giving you oral and it was gerring to point of pain for him, but he is complaining about 5 minutes?? Where's his foreplay? Effort? He wants you coming in less time than it takes me to make breakfast?? 

Third, you are not ""pathetic"" for getting ""this upset about sex."" Sex is important. 

Fourth, he doesn't get to LET you use toys or MAKE you use toys. Tons of men would be very happy with anything that makes you happy. 

All this is his rules (no toys, no kinks), and puts it all on you to snap to it. I'm sure he'd feel great if you complained about his...um, duration. /s It's totally fine if he is vanilla. Lots of people are. It's not fine for you to feel frustrated, pathetic, lonely, confused. 

"
201,Me too.  I hope for her sake she realizes he‚Äôs garbage in less time than I did.

She didn't not only ""totally"" reject you, she didn't reject you at all. She agreed to a date and is looking forward to it. So stop worrying, meet her, have a good time, be kind and take it from there. You've had a crush for a little while, now is the time you get to know each other."

So does hunting and beers, an Air BnB and a 36-hour D&amp;D campaign, some joints and a music festival, Scotch and cigars, those dumb beer-and-pedal bicycle trolley tours, and a handful of other bachelor parties I‚Äôve been to that don‚Äôt involve literally hiring a sex worker and pressuring your friend to sleep with her. Nope, this may be a Hollywood stereotype, but this kind of bachelor party isn‚Äôt common among decent people. Decent being the operative word."

206,"gtfo, seriously. It's not going to get better."
207,"&gt;I‚Äôm an every other day kinda guy and could probably even be an every single day person. My love for her has always outweighed this problem 

A few points...

* You and her are sexually incompatible.

* *You cannot negotiate or convince her to want to have sex more frequently.* You've been together over five years so you know her sex drive is. You cannot change someone on a fundamental level, you have to accept who they are with eyes wide open and decide if you want to be with them or not.

* **This is something worth breaking up over**. I'll repeat, this is something worth breaking up over. Sex is no small thing in a relationship. For example, OP you mentioned that neither of you have cheated -- in your relationship fidelity is agreed upon (that is, sex or romantic flings with others would be a betrayal) -- so sex with someone else is important enough to break up over but initiating a *conversation* up that you're unsatisfied with the sex life you share together leads to a fight?.. Think on that.

* Society conditions many of us to think being dissatisfied over sex is not a valid reason to break up, but situations where you are not compatible cause more suffering in the long run. If you had incompatible views on having children, would you agree that's a valid reason to break up so that you could find someone who wanted the same thing you do in that regard?

* Final point, it's possible for some people to want a romantic relationship (commitment, companionship, possessiveness, affection) without desiring sex from their partner. It works if both partners feel the same. Additionally, it works when there is transparency about the terms of their relationship and one partner decides they accept having a non sexual/low sexual relationship. **It doesn't work when the partner who wants more sex isn't okay with the setup**; unfortunately you are in this latter group, OP.. so you have a decision to make: *break up* (why not be good friends instead so there's no sexual expectations and you are free to pursue other relationships?) or *stay accepting things as they are* (once a month oral only)."
208,"&gt; I feel like if we stop going to the store altogether that's a cop-out - that's where we've always shopped and this isn't something worth being scared about forever. 

If she‚Äôs the one doing the grocery shopping, then this is really her decision to make, not yours. If there is another place where she can shop that isn‚Äôt significantly more expensive or inconvenient, then I think switching stores for a while is a perfectly valid option so that she can feel comfortable. 

And here‚Äôs the thing about talking to the manager: they can‚Äôt really do anything to make your wife feel safer except to maybe fire the employee. If the manager says, ‚ÄúOkay, I talked to the employee &amp; told him not to follow your wife around the store‚Äù - is that good enough to make her feel safe shopping there again? Does she feel confident that he won‚Äôt ever follow her or reach out to her again? Or is she worried it‚Äôll still happen if that manager isn‚Äôt around?"
209,"Step 1, stop feeling guilty. You‚Äôre not their mom, you‚Äôre not responsible for feeding them. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done but that‚Äôs going to be the hardest battle - your own internal guilt. 

I would simply respond with those comments with ‚Äúyea it does smell good, it‚Äôs ratatouille, my mom‚Äôs special recipe‚Äù or simply ‚Äúno thanks, I already have dinner‚Äù when they offer. 

And I would stop the habit of sharing food with them period. If it‚Äôs tough to set boundaries, then maybe you need to just go cold turkey right away. "
210,"&gt; If you dont stop being a fuck your meal ticket is going to leave you

I went and read the original post and I am pretty sure this is exactly what was said. 
"
211,"His ""sobbing"" was not because of what he said. Think about what you just wrote. He said something HORRIBLE to you, after you've dedicated yourself to helping raise his children. Something that made you CRY. And how does he respond to your pain?

By making YOU comfort HIM. He isn't sorry, he will most likely do this again."

213,"You should reach out, yes, because a change in personality and inappropriate behavior could be a sign of declining mental health. He may be getting dementia/Alzheimer's"
214,As a good friend should.
215,"You aren't listening.  Move that money.  She could very well take it, too."
216,"&gt;wants me to move in with him to support him,

Aw hell no. This guy wants a new mom whose able to buy him more things than his current mom instead of working on his own problems.

Before you break up with him, notify his mother you are about to so she can watch out for any suicidal behavior."
217,Engaged and married on the same day?? JFC there are so many terrible decisions being made here. 
218,"Real talk, this could be the hardest thing you ever have to do. It probably is thus far. Remember to take time for yourself, to be alone or with friends. There's something called 'caretakers fatigue' that happens to people caring for others who are very sick or dying. It is normal to feel exasperated. 

You'll get through it, I'm very sorry. "
219,"To add on to this, make sure you address the texts. Him calling it an ""amazing night"" when it wasn't can cause your husband to misinterpret what actually went down unless you clarify that he confessed and assaulted you.

**Response to OP's edit**: I'm glad to see that your husband took it pretty well! I don't think your relationship with your husband's parents is going to be affected by this. You should insist that you will not attend functions where your BIL is present. This might force your husband's parents to kick BIL out of their house if they want to see you and your husband again, but that's okay, they should be willing to do that at the very least. You should also insist that your BIL get therapy otherwise you will file a police report. Inform your SIL about the forced kiss and leave the decision to her as to whether or not she wants to leave/stay. Once again, you are not at fault here. Please don't feel guilty about any of this. BIL brought it upon himself."
220,"This honestly sounds super fishy. Are you friends with him on Facebook, instagram, etc? I do get the feeling that it is him feeding you a line about her being okay with it but not wanting to know. Seems like his way of telling you to keep your relationship on the DL. Do you guys go out publicly? Have you met his friends or family? "
221,"So she‚Äôs not just having doubts, she‚Äôs carrying on an emotional affair. Stop downplaying it and call it as it is."
222,Get an attorney and file.  
223,You mean call her out on it? Hm. I guess never. I just stay silent and stop doing what I'm doing since I'm so clearly doing it wrong.
224,"Does this really sound like the type of girl that you want to marry?  

1. She is flirting with guys  
2. She's having an emotional affair with one of them  
3. The only reason she isn't escalating is because she's afraid _they_ will reject her  
4. She feels like she can do better than you  
  

**I think you deserve much better.**  

Don't you?"
225,"So say you change your number. What's next? You can't go to certain places because a woman might say hi to you. You can't order from a woman in a restaurant, or wave at someone you know from work.

Is this the rabbit hole you want to fall into? Or would you rather be with someone who trusts you and treats you like a fucking adult?"
226,"You did well to weed him out op, good luck"
227,"God I thought my in-laws were bad... Once you feel comfortable enough (or apathetic enough) try calling them out on something. ""That's a really weird thing you're doing."" ""Woah, you just made him spill everywhere--why would you do that?"" ""If you're worried about the cost we can split the bill, no worries.""

I challenge my ILs on some of the boneheaded things they say and whether it helps them with reality or just makes them dislike me more at least I feel less like jumping head first out the window."
228,"I‚Äôve been in a relationship like that and yeah, first you‚Äôre like, that‚Äôs fine, we just won‚Äôt work out together, or go running, or drink, or go for a walk when he‚Äôs hungry...and you trim away those triggers, but if it becomes physical, you‚Äôre going to be the one facing those consequences.

You don‚Äôt want to live with someone who treats you like this."
229,"Given the unsettling rumors that you've heard and that he's got past restraining orders against him, and also your gut feeling of danger, I think you should be less concerned about ostracizing him and more concerned about protecting your sister and any other vulnerable members of the group.

Teach your sister to say ""Leave me alone,"" when he approaches her.

Tell Jerry yourself that he should not speak to your sister any more. Don't explain, don't justify, just say ""Do not speak to my sister anymore,"" and leave it at that.

Go to the leader of the group and tell the leader that Jerry is making your sister uncomfortable. Jerry may be making other people uncomfortable as well and the leader needs all of the data points.

You can continue to speak with him if you wish, but you should be more upfront and direct when you don't want to talk anymore. 

""Thank you for the chat, I need to go speak to other people now. Good-bye."""
230,The ‚Äúamazing night‚Äù texts may be a setup so that if you rat him out he can claim it was all you and he got caught up in it or something and the texts wont be clear who did what. Reply to them retelling what he did and that you are upset disgusted etc so you can get him acknowledging what he did in writing. 
231,"Hey. Sorry for what you're going through, but I just want you to give yourself some credit. To go from that background to doing a BA and MA is incredible. And your parents sound like great people. But don't ever think that what you're feeling is not valid because it is. I think what your girlfriend suggested is a good idea, it might be good to get some closure on your past but it will equally be very trying. And you might feel overwhelmed. Everyone deserves to feel at peace with their life and I hope you find the steps needed to be at peace too so you can fully start living your life. I'm sorry I don't have more advice to offer but just congratulate yourself for how far you've come. Good luck with everything, OP. "
232,"He is already thinking of a future without you...and you've only been married for two and a half months!!

Get out now, cut your losses. And take *your* car when you go."
233,It can come across that you‚Äôre using her place instead of visiting her 
234,"Message his wife. On instagram. 

Honestly I‚Äôd ask to meet up with her. It‚Äôs been a fucking year. Would love to know what sort of brain surgery she thinks he‚Äôs been of doing. "
235,"&gt; I am in the process of finding a new job but I need advice till then

Just lay low. "
236,"This was the only way we got my father to stop damaging his health for attention. He was diabetic and would mess up his blood sugar on purpose then call for help. We would scramble over and help him through it. After a few times I told him that next time we would send an ambulance. Diabetic coma was a seriously possibility and I wouldn't take that risk alone again. 

I said if he wanted to get healthy I'd spend time with him working on that but I was going to let the crisis workers deal with his emergencies.

He didn't do it again. I went to his regular doctor's appointments with him. We did meal planning together on Sunday. He saw more of me instead of less. We spent time together while he was healthy instead of when he was sick.

It was difficult to set a boundary with my aging father but it was one of the best decisions of my life.

Maybe you can offer to attend therapy with him (healthy attention) and tell him next time he needs a ride to the hospital you'll send an ambulance (firm boundary)."
237,"It sounds like she knows what she did was incredibly trashy and not to mention cruel, embarrassment is usually what is behind outbursts like that."
238,"I'm tired of people saying ""But it's been x years"".
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY. Darling, you deserve so much better. This relationship is very very over. "
239,"Cook for yourself. Just for yourself. Stop pandering to his whims and complaints. Cook the food that you want to eat, only enough for you. He's not going to starve, he can look after himself.

You know you're a good cook, plenty of other people tell you, and I assume you enjoy your own cooking. Forget about your boyfriend's opinion. He's acting like a picky toddler ""I only want pancakes today! ...I want nutella! ...I want meat, oh actually no I don't, I dont like that anymore!"" Would you let a 2 year old's opinion of your food knock your confidence? Your boyfriend has been spoilt and catered to like a 2 year old his whole life and hasn't grown out of that stage, the only way to get him out of it is to stop letting him get his own way."
240,"Why not invite both of them and split the cost of the meal that isn't covered?

Then I'd say ""thanks for coming out with me! You guys have been so nice and it's been hard for me to make friends out here!"" That might prompt them to invite you to more outings with their larger friend group? "
241,"I‚Äôd go for the truth and show respect and calmness while talking, even though people won‚Äôt believe it. "
242,"I haven't contacted him and he hasn't texted back. Gwen saved the video. I'm very tempted to put his important things in bags, put them in a row near the front door, then send him a picture.

Then I'd text the video to a text thread we have with some friends. And a text thread with him and his mom. "
243,"I didn't screw around on mine.  I don't think you screw around unless you want to, I don't buy into the social pressure bullshit excuse.

It also isn't something I think is normal either.

That fact that he did it and sees nothing wrong with it would makes me think he will do it on his and just lie to you.

He told you that is how it is, but then says it is cheating.  Sorry, that isn't comforting.

He also is a pretty terrible guy to try to get his friend to cheat on his soon to be wife.

"
244,Why would be married to someone you can‚Äôt trust not to poke holes in the condoms?! You shouldn‚Äôt have sex with people you don‚Äôt trust. 
245,"&gt; i told you before. in order for this relationship to work i need an  absurd level of attraction and commitment from you. i need you to be  absolutely crazy about me. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is an ENORMOUS FUCKING RED FLAG. I legit felt queasy reading that.

&amp;#x200B;

Run. Now. He doesn't want a partner, he wants a worshiper to feed his ego."
246,"So he knows that to your face he has to pretend he doesn't condone cheating, but behind your back it's a big joke? I honestly think this is disgusting and would tell the wife and leave him. I think I'd provide proof, maybe text your bf about it all asking for more details or why. Then show these texts to her. She deserves to know. She's being humiliated every time she sees any of these men.


I don't care how ""kind"" this man is. He doesn't respect women and that's fucked up. I'd leave."
247,"You did the right thing by breaking up. Having children isn‚Äôt something you can compromise on- someone is going to be unhappy. I know right now it feels like you won‚Äôt get over it, but given some time, you will. I think you should put some distance between you and your ex though... continuing to contact each other will make recovering so much harder. "
248,Oh wow. This is really awesome advice! I appreciate this so much. You are awesome too for all the great work you do. Thank you 
249,"Are other people getting ill as well? You should be able to find that out subtly by saying something like ""I need to see the doctor about my food allergies again, I felt really sick after dinner last night"" and if they say ""actually me too"" then the food is the problem, but if they say ""oh you poor thing"" then you are the problem not the food.

Either way, just bow out of the whole group-cooking thing if it's making you sick. You can always use your medical issues as the excuse without actively blaming the food."
250,"I know you're hesitant to leave him, but I was in this situation with my boyfriend (now husband) before we got married.  Twelve years and two kids later, it is not any better and just that much harder to leave.  Get out while you still can.  This is not someone who cares about changing his habits for you, and it will lead to huge resentment in the long run."
251,"Hi. I manufacture vaporizer cartridges for a living.

Your husband seems to be...well...higher than eagle balls.

Sounds like he took the extract (cannabis distillate) out of the cartridges and smoked it right up. Here's why I think that.

He's perfectly describing how to get the distillate out of a prepared pen (pooling). A larger gauge would not be exciting if he were injecting anything (ouch). He's already confirmed smoking cartridges. 

In my professional opinion your husband drank while smoking and got some spins."
252,There were a lot of red flags that were ignored
253,"She became angry once when I said I was proud of my female cousin for getting her PhD. And mind you, that my girlfriend is one of the most accomplished people I‚Äôve ever met"
254,"Honestly, I think faking a British accent would be worse. I'm an American who studied abroad in London for a year, and I can't imagine that going over well."
255,I stopped reading after she listed all those red flags and still wasn't married to him. Then she STILL WENT THROUGH WITH THE WEDDING like whyyyyy girl whyyyyy. Marriage doesn't fix. 
256,"laying low is a good idea. Those people don't sound like great friends to begin with. Secondly, she'll eventually move on and people will start to see that *she* is the one surrounded by a shit storm of drama wherever she goes. They'll start to see that the problem was likely *her*. I've had ex-friends and ex-boyfriends who behaved that way and eventually, *everyone* saw what kind of person they were. They came back and tried to seek my comfort over the horrible things they did to them. But I just wished them well, said I'm sorry that person did that to you, and I'm not surprised considering how they treated me. But you had your chance to be my friend then, and you'll have to find someone else to comfort you now. All the best! "
257,"I get that you love him OP, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like your getting played. Everything I‚Äôve read so far indicates that you blame yourself for everything and allow him to leech off of you. The only reason he has made a ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù  (if you can even call it that) is because he realizes there is an ever so slight chance for him to lose his free income. I mean your essentially paying for his dream life, having an open relationship, and blaming yourself for everything so he doesn‚Äôt have any guilt. "
258,"Alternately: Youve randomly ghosted all of your friends for a month and a half. 

If you no longer feel close to them, consider making new friends. If this happens again with a large amount of people, consider why you dont make close friendships. A therapist who specializes in social situations might be helpful. "
259,"Lots of armchair activists out today. OP, I for one think your boyfriend is being completely unreasonable. Everyone likes to fantasize about being the person to stand up, make a scene, and show the evil man just how wrong he really is. But to transfer that fantasy onto someone else and become angry at them for not living it out is unfair, and to bully them about it is rude (and unrealistic).





That being said, you've already talked to him. There's nothing you can do other than let him get over it in time- however, don't let him take it out on you too much. Yelling, lecturing, snarky comments and insults are not okay. He's admitted that he isn't mad at you, so don't allow him to treat YOU like he is.





If you're getting public harassment, and it's bad, I would consider changing your hair style/colour and dressing a bit differently, to minimize chances of people bullying you on the street. And turn off those comments on social media! No need to read all that negativity. It isn't your fault and you didn't do anything wrong- they're just taking their frustration about the country out on you."
260,"You are not a prude OP, you have standards.  Well done in this situation."
261,All I can picture is a 60 year old man guzzling Italian dressing packets while his nervous wife adds up the Italian dressing calories on her phone's calculator. 
262,"If my dad ever did something like this I would lose basically all respect for him. It‚Äôs sexist, demeaning, patronizing and gross. I don‚Äôt believe in shovel talks already, and this is so far beyond that. In my opinion, your dad doesn‚Äôt respect you.  He thinks what he wants for your life is more important than your choices and agency. I don‚Äôt know what your relationship was like before, but if I were you, I would create significant distance between you. Be polite but distant, if he wants a close relationship, he has to apologize and mean it. Obviously, there‚Äôs a chance he may never apologize and you have to decided if you can accept that and, if so, what relationship you‚Äôre willing to have. Until then, I would treat him like my mom‚Äôs husband, not my dad."
263,"&gt;I'm even more pissed with the fact that I'm working my ass off as an RN 50+ hours a week and saving every dime to afford going to medschool next year, but my mother just pulls money from my savings account. Yes it has some of my parent's money that they deposited over the years and they can take it if they want

Gain control of your bank account, you are 23 years old your mother should not have the ability to take money out of your account for any reason. 

Any money they gave you is yours legally, if you want to give it back to them so be it but create a new account that your mother can't pull out your money from. 

If your sisters want money from you they need to ask you for it.

You should also inform your father of what is actually going on to, your mother hiding this from him is unfair. 

"
264,"A subtler starter version of this would be to start being *extremely* apologetic to the waitstaff. Flag them down yourself when a drink spills instead of letting everyone wait for them to notice, or ask them for extra napkins when there's salsa on the table ‚Äî ""Oh gosh I'm *so* sorry, we got a little clumsy over here and made a big mess for you folks. Can I trouble you for some extra napkins?""

If you wanna twist the knife, when the bill comes, tell the in-laws you feel obliged to throw in some of your money to double the tip, since ""they were so accommodating to us"". Drive home the connection between their obnoxious behavior and the people it affects"
265,you should get advice from a doctor.
266,"As a woman with very nerdy, male dominated hobbies, I have been in the position your girlfriend is in now several times. Unfortunately, the only way I ended up resolving said issues was to cut out a lot of ""friends"" and find new ones.

I completely understand her ""I don't want to get involved"" attitude. All you friends are defending this guy. They're on his side. Oftentimes, when a woman speaks up about a guy who's been harassing her, that guy's friends close ranks and protect him. Then your girlfriend gets labeled as a self absorbed narcissist who thinks everyone is into her. She becomes the bad guy. And then you get to hear all your friends tell you about how your girlfriend sucks and why haven't you broken up with her yet?

So, in her mind, the easiest way to deal with this is to ignore it and not make waves, and hope he eventually goes away. Sometimes it works, and they move on to another target. A lot of the time it doesn't work, and you finally have to lay down the law. 

She is likely worried how this whole situation will affect you as well. You might very well lose some friends over this if they choose to side with Alex and continue to claim he's just harmless and nice, and she doesn't want to put you in a position of having to choose between her and them. 

As for how he treats you, you start calling him out every time he does. Tell him you won't tolerate him being a shit to you, and he needs to knock it off. If he doesn't, and your other friends don't support you, you might need to find some new friends."
267,"&gt; How can I marry someone who doesn't stand up for me? 

This is 100% the right question for you to be asking, but you need to ask her not us. Since you're asking what we would do in that situation, me personally, I would ask that question point blank before I considered going to the bbq, and I'd be leaning towards ""don't go"" the whole time. Basically you already know that there are people there who don't like you for what you are, and your partner isn't willing to stand up for you against those people."
268,The only problem with the huge dildo is the fact that you are still with him. 
269,"First and foremost do **not** say or do anything to this person. Tons of reasons why: it's just going to be gas on her crazy fire, it's not appropriate for you to contact your partner's coworkers about personal issues (ever, no matter what the case), and it's not your boundary to set, it's his.


Second, I have to question these ""boundaries"" you say your BF has agreed to set up. He's either got very different ideas of what boundaries are or you're not teling the whole story as to how effective he is at following through. Specifically, why was this girl at his bday? How did she even know where he'd be if he's not talking to her about personal things? How and why is an underage drinker at a bar with him/her manager??

He needs to continue to enforce existing boundaries and stop telling her when and where he's going out drinking. Unless you live in the world's smallest town with only 1 bar, any time she shows up ""randomly"" to a social event would be an indicator that he told her where to be. This is a boyfriend problem, not a you problem or a her problem."
270,"Is your friend, the husband, still speaking to you or is he ignoring your messages? "
271,"If you can manage to wait, see your lawyer before you confront him. You'll want to get your ducks in row before this all blows up. Also, if he has paid for escorts, get those bank records and/or any credit card transactions relating to them, even if you simply suspect they *might* be (like suspicious vacations/purchases for gifts you never recieved). Bring those copies with you when you meet with your attorney.

Be sure to *not* vacate the house under any circumstances for more than the usual time (like for work). This can be used against you for home ownership if you do leave.

Do you have pets? If so, make sure your name is on the chip (but don't take his off without your lawyer's thumbs up). Get their paperwork together, too.

Cars? Shared assets? Paperwork. Gotta bring it all.

Sorry you're going through this, I wish you the best of luck in getting rid of that horrible man and moving on to greener grasses! "
272,Lawyers probably love it.
273,"You know you can cut him out of your life, yes? You don't have to answer to anyone else on this. There doesn't have to be a big confrontation over everything. You might lose other friends but frankly if they aren't willing to accept the reality of the situation, that his behavior is driving you away, then I can't see that as a great loss.

The friends who don't believe you? They will once you and your girlfriend are out of the circle and he's turning the creepy on them."
274,My parents want to do this on a smaller scale for my sister - they really like her fianc√©e and no one thinks they will ever split but our parents still want a clause in the money about it going all to sister if they did happen to split up - you know your father - us the offer coming from malice or just looking out for you? My parents have heard 3 different stories of this going wrong which is why they are so determined to protect my sis - it‚Äôs nothibg to do with her fianc√©e and everything to do with looking out for her x
275,"&gt;but I also don‚Äôt want to ruin my relationship over a $20 toy.


You wouldn't be ruining it over a 20 dollar toy. You'd be ruining it because your boyfriend is a complete and utter asshole. 


"
276,Pay a visit to r/DeadBedrooms. I believe you will find a great wealth of resources there and a community who understands exactly what you're going through.
277,"London is full of people from different places who all dress how they feel and speak completely different languages, let alone slightly different versions of English. The vast majority of Brits understand US slang as we watch so much US T.V. so it's not like we're going to be baffled by you using it. And even if we are, we mostly just laugh together as we try to work out what each other means. And 99% of people will then just want to chat about where you're from etc.

I wonder if your girlfriend is anxious about you 'sticking out' and drawing attention to you and by association to her. Or is that being too kind. I think significant others who try to change things about you, especially after only 3 months, are a bit worrying. If you weren't from the US would she be trying to make you drop your regional accent, or nagging about your old t-shirts?

I know most others commenting are saying it's coming from a place of kindness, and maybe that's true, but if she was nagging you about shaving off a beard or mocking you for your clothes looking to cheap we'd all be on here telling you to see it as a red flag."
278,"No offence, but it sounds like there is something deeply wrong with your self-esteem that you knew all this and married the guy anyway. Please do not waste a minute longer on him and start preparing to leave. I promise you, being alone is one thousand times better than this. You are still young, you could be investing in your own future right now instead of letting this guy piss your life away. Go enjoy your independence and learn to love yourself. You won't regret it, but you will regret it if you end up ten years down the road and you're still stuck with this loser."
279,"Nothing about liking to lean on your partner is either submissive or dominant in nature, kiddo. It's just a preference. It's not unmanly. I agree with u/therulert that you really need to stop referring to his behaviour as such, or you are being part of the problem."
280,"Time to enforce consequences for breaking the rules. She doesn't tell you boyfriend is visiting? Sorry, he can't visit tonight. You knew the rule, you agreed to the rule, actions have consequences. She's late on rent? Hassle her for it every single day, start making noises about eviction. What you allow will continue.

Trouble is, there's almost no way of handling this without her throwing a tantrum and your relationship being damaged, because that's the kind of person she is. Anyone reasonable you wouldn't have to worry about how to bring it up, because you could just bring it up! Have a conversation, problem solved. The fact that you know you have to worry about *how* to bring it up means you know she's going to blow up, no matter how kindly you word it. You're not being fair, you're enabling her and being doormats. But you need to decide if preserving the relationship is more important than your house being disrespected, because it'll almost certainly come down to an either / or situation. "
281,"Thank you! I honestly didn't see gift giving as anything odd, so some of the replies kind of baffled me. I appreciate the compliments! &lt;3"
282,"Yeah absolutely.

&gt; [lol please don't downvote me for being a prude I just don't want to know that the man i'm sleeping with also sleep with other people]. Anyway he agreed to wait and we had a lovely night just cuddling and making out.

You are not a prude. You wanted to make sure the two of you were compatible and on the same page and you were right. You seem very mature and were very smart about handling the situation."
283,"There are two possibilities. One is that his girlfriend has no idea he‚Äôs seeing you. 

The other is that he‚Äôs telling the truth. However, when I see a relationship that‚Äôs only open on one side I immediately suspect that the other person only agreed to the arrangement because they were scared of being abandoned. "
284,"I would sit her down &amp; ask what is going on? Explain you were honest, you were upfront, &amp; she blew you off with an attitude.. She might be processing it, but go with your gut feeling. 

Give her maybe a day or two of space, but finally sit down with her &amp; talk. If she won't, then don't press it anymore. "
285,"Oh your divorce isn‚Äôt final yet? If not, try to get this included in the property settlement. You should be given management of it permanently. Don‚Äôt assume everyone will act reasonably or in your child‚Äôs best interest in the future, even if they are doing so today. I have also seen many cases where these types of accounts are handled in the property division. Look into that. "
286,"I don't understand. You guys DO have money, especially compared to her parents. And she works in finance? The cognitive dissonance is...astounding


I'm worried about her parents eventually relying on the two of you for money.

I'm surprised she thought she'd get it - the job is in finance, they wanted graduate degrees and certifications. You can't ""learn on the job."" I know they didn't even interview her for the position, so I don't understand why she's so upset. 

I do love the job and it's a great promotion for me. I don't want to give it up at all. I just don't know how to approach her without causing it to become an HR issue and my friend is being spineless.

She didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù for your sake. She did it for hers. I‚Äôm not saying that to demonize her - it‚Äôs a classic rookie mistake. She‚Äôs feeling guilty about the way things ended and wants you to tell her that everything‚Äôs fine and dandy so she doesn‚Äôt have to feel bad. But she‚Äôs gotta process those bad feelings without involving you. You‚Äôre the *last* person she should be asking for reassurance. 

Block her number. And grieve the relationship. Confide in a friend or family member and cry. Wallow if you want, but only for a few days. Make sure to get back into your routine before you stagnate. But a few days of junk food and naps and feeling so sad you almost have to laugh at yourself might be just what you need. 

And for what it‚Äôs worth, it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúeasy‚Äù for your ex to move on - she just did all her angsting and grieving before the relationship actually ended. You didn‚Äôt. So do it now. Let yourself feel as sad as you need to feel and then get back to your regularly scheduled life. Just because you didn‚Äôt grieve when your ex did doesn‚Äôt mean she ‚Äúwon‚Äù the breakup.

You need to face the fact that there is never going to be a wedding between the two of you, not ever.   Money is the second most cited reason for divorce and you can't even fathom getting married to someone like this.

Your girlfriend is a 31-year old child.  She's been enabled by her family to be a leech and suck up money wherever she can find it.  Don't let her have any more of yours.   Take your car back and let her deal with the consequences.

&gt;I might want to add, she is going to grad school for special education, 

So she hasn't actually been a teacher before?  Because special ed takes a lot of fortitude and is not for someone as undisciplined as your girlfriend."

How, exactly? How could she possibly do that when she can't even afford a fucking babysitter? And WHY? Why does your mother think your sister would be so willing to help you in return for NOTHING, when she's not even willing to pay you for the SOMETHING you ARE doing for her - babysitting her child? 

Maybe you need to be strategically unavailable for awhile - go right from school or work to the library, and study there, pack whatever you need for the day when you leave the house (a lunch/dinner, charging cords, whatever). Then you won't be around for the kid to be pawned off onto you. If they don't ever ask/tell you ahead of time, you can feign ignorance - how were you supposed to know they wanted you to babysit, when no one said anything. If it's sort of a ""formal"" schedule, give a heads-up, just claim you've got school projects that require you to stay later for group meetings or whatever, and don't be around. 

And if the kid is really sucking up a lot of your free time anyway, maybe see about getting an actual paying job to get out of the house. Then you'll be making money AND not being around for the kid. But only if you can find a job with a schedule that's the right fit."
333,"So, all I‚Äôm hearing is,‚Äù I need to magically fix myself and until I do my husband still doesn‚Äôt have to give up anything or work even a little harder.

Depression and working through things take time it can‚Äôt be done on a schedule and 2. Your current situation is a big part of why you‚Äôre depressed.

334,"I kind of wonder if your husband wants you to help him make friends. You have friends you hang out with and talk to and you named several ""things"" you do so it is clear you have interests outside of your family. There is no problem with the way you live now. 

That said, if your boyfriend is very shy, maybe it would be nice and helpful to him if you went out and did things together with the possibility of making couple's friends. Like join a book club, cooking class, dance class, the PTA, etc together, so he feels less awkward going alone. Any activity you both enjoy would work. 

The therapist part seems weird though. Like if you are being honest with both Reddit and the therapist, it might be time to find a new therapist. Not because they are encouraging you to get outside of your comfort zone, but because they are choosing sides. "

* He is more worried about your ability to sexually arouse him than he is your health.

I've come to realize family is pretty much a very privileged group of friends that knows you will be very vulnerable and have your guard down *when it comes to money*. When it's all said &amp; done, your sisters are going to be CHILLIN at home and you're going to be busting your ass still to make the med school happen.

342,"&gt; My son does see a therapist sometimes as he has on and off depression and she said that Booey is his ‚Äúcomfort object‚Äù and it would be very detrimental to his mental health to take her away.   
&gt;  
&gt; Is this unhealthy? Should we even do anything at all? 

Look, you pay a professional to help your son with his mental health issues; maybe you should be directing these questions at her?

Also good god, if the therapist straight up *told you* that it would be bad to forcibly take Booey away, why did you??

I know you're just worried about your kid, but ultimately carrying a stuffed animal around everywhere seems like a pretty minor quirk. If the therapist is not focusing on distancing your son from Booey, it may be because she feels it would be more beneficial to focus elsewhere.

* Talk to your son's therapist to get a better idea of his progress and current challenges
* Talk to your son and his therapist to see if he would benefit from seeing her more than 'off and on'
* Trust that your son will prioritize leaving Booey behind once he feels more secure and/or the consequences for carrying around a stuffed animal matter more to him (lowered dating prospects, etc) In the meantime, be a *safe space* for him"

I would do them the curtesy of telling them first that you'd like them to stop. Ideally in person and then over email/in writing in some way so you have it documented. Express what you expressed in this post. If they don't stop you'll have a SOLID harassment case for HR at that point. 

If you aren't comfortable doing that it isn't your obligation, but it is HR's job. The picture thing is harassment already.

The advice giving though...leave that out of any HR action. That is probably coming from a good place. Even if you don't want it, they probably mean well and you should tell them that you are really uncomfortable talking about it and would rather your personal life stay separate from work.

349,"Hi, I‚Äôm a veteran like-r too. My boyfriend and I have been together for over 5 years mind you, so maybe the dynamic is a bit different. We‚Äôre also both quite direct when we want to be.

Do you know how my boyfriend got me to stop? Not by having a Big Talk‚Ñ¢ with me where he looks me in the eye and says this is for my own good. Not by being passive aggressive and sliding me a recording of me talking with a judgemental look. Not by sheepishly pointing it out before bed by counting out how many times and when I said it and shoving printouts from some self-help Buzzfeed style blog into my unsuspecting arms.

But when I did it, he would *tell me* in the moment and say, light-heartedly, OH MY GOD YOU‚ÄôRE DOING IT AGAIN

Like a dog peeing on the carpet, you have to react as it‚Äôs happening! That‚Äôs what will make those neurological wirings of learning something new actually stick. If you tell him afterwards or when he‚Äôs not doing it, he‚Äôs not gonna remember that conversation tomorrow when he tells you the new story. Also, if you tell him as he‚Äôs telling you, then you don‚Äôt have to listen to it because he‚Äôll immediately stop (even if he starts again briefly next time). So just tell him! As those blackboard nails start flaring, just tell him ‚Äî and again, let me emphasise, *in good humor* ‚Äî you‚Äôre doing it again! 

I‚Äôm honestly quite surprised at a lot of these responses; they just feel either super dramatic or super petty. I mean, when he does it, just say something about it. Until he stops. Especially because you‚Äôve already Said Something in a more serious way. It doesn‚Äôt have to be harder than that. I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt WANT to say like all the time.

‚ÄúThere was this, like, really big, like, bus thing, today, li-‚Äù

359,"&gt;The few people I‚Äôve told about this have had wildly different reactions. From ‚Äúif I see him I‚Äôm going to make him as upset as you were‚Äù 

I would stop talking about this with other people ‚Äì especially coworkers. I understand the need to vent, but all you're doing is throwing fuel on the fire. Gossip travels fast and things get distorted when people share second-hand accounts of stories they've heard. 

&gt;No action at work has been taken. The manager didn‚Äôt file any report and she didn‚Äôt tell any of the other managers what happened. 

I think there's a strong possibility that your manager didn't file a report because she doesn't know what really happened. When she tried to speak with you about it, you ""kept throwing out generic responses"" and didn't actually vocalize that he had shoved you. She might have been present for the aftermath, but that doesn't mean she knows what *actually* happened since she didn't see it. As far as she knows, two of her coworkers just had a spat while tensions were running high during a busy shift. 

So, you need to speak with your manager again now that you're calm and collected. Be direct and try to keep your emotions out of it. Physical contact like this isn't acceptable in the workplace, and your coworker needs to learn to manage his stress better. If she isn't willing to listen, then speak with a different manager or proceed to HR if you have one. Don't speak with this coworker until you've spoken to management. "
360,"&gt;He's honestly the kindest person I've ever met

You thought he was the kindest person you had ever met until you learnt what he does for his own entertainment. Your boyfriend found it funny to push his friend to cheat.

&amp;#x200B;

You're confused, because you didn't expect it from him. You didn't expect it from him, because until now he had been hiding this side of him. This is part of him. It may not be the whole of him, but it is part of him and sadly that possibly makes him a shit sandwich, depending on where you draw the line. (In my opinion, he's a shit sandwich.) A sandwich can have all the things you like: lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, cheese, but when it has shit on it, it's a health hazard. You can try to eat around the shit or try to scrape the shit off, but it stays a health hazard. You decide whether pushing someone to cheat for your own entertainment is shitty in your opinion. Your boyfriend does not have to agree with your opinion for your opinion to be a valid factor in where you draw the line on what's acceptable in your life."

364,"First of all you didn‚Äôt cheat on your husband so remove those thoughts from your mind. You didn‚Äôt want any of that and he forced himself onto you. Not your fault at all. 

Second of all just tell you husband that you need to talk to him about something when he gets home and just be honest about what happened. Also block your BIL from texting you. His behavior is very inappropriate. "

366,"&gt;Grow up and learn how to control your emotions

Ms. Pot, I have Ms. Kettle on line 1 for you.

I would have been beyond angry at being spoken to like that by a stranger, let alone a partner.  I think my fury would have sublimed into pure pettiness as I messily flicked paint on the wall while incredulously asking if I was doing it right."
367,"Brave of you to post your story in English!

&gt;One day he decided to stop talking and disappeared  
&gt;  
&gt;Is it common break for Americans?

No, this isn't a common type of break up for Americans. I'm sure all nationalities have people that do this.

To just disappear and stop talking without an explanation is called ""ghosting"" . It's quite rude and unsettling to the other person because you're left in the dark. But the fact of the matter is, he's not interested in being with you anymore, so you should stop trying to contact him and move on."
368,"&gt;Roommate is going to have to develop a thicker skin if he goes through with the marriage, because he‚Äôs going to hear a lot worse when news gets out.

Similar but not exactly parallel story.. my brother got married to a girl who he'd known for years, but never been into. She has a... reputation for being a manipulative, rude, demanding, not-so-great person. He disliked but pitied her. Then, they told everyone they were in love and going to get married. And they literally sat down *everyone* in their lives and said, (I'm paraphrasing), ""We know you all think this is a piss-poor, stupid-as-fuck decision, and while we'll hear out your concerns but in the end we don't give a fuck, we're doing this.""

If you're going to make a shitty decision like marrying someone you've only known for 3 months when you're 18 years old, you gotta have those cajones of steel to tell everyone to go fuck themselves if they have any concerns.

(Or you could listen to wise counsel and not make the shitty decision.... to each his own)"
369,"Alternatively you could change your number, don't give her your new number, and never talk to her again. "
370,"You don't ""need"" to do anything. It's her **legal responsibility** to tell him if she's moving you away. I'm on the edge of suggesting you call someone in authority and tell them what's going on, but someone better informed than me might know if that's a good idea or not. "
371,"I think that would be more heartache for you then it would be worth. If it were me, I would send him the video with the message ""this is exactly the kind of behavior I refuse to tolerate. Goodbye."""
372,"No, it's not normal for somebody to expect you to go against your manners and insult a host who is providing you a meal. Your ex is being ridiculous and honestly if he is trying to place blame for his ""suffering at home"" on you, then maybe it's best that he remains your ex. "
373,"I do .... I'm thinking a puppy, a kayak, a time share, or a star ...."
374,"&gt; He finally owned up to it and said that he just didn't wanna tell me about it bc I would get jealous and it was innocent.

Ugh. The classic ""I lied to you *for your own good!*"" line.

OP, the meetup itself with this other girl is already shady. But the fact that he hid it from you, lied about it, and then *continued to lie about it* after you confronted him, is a much bigger problem. Plus trying to justify it afterwards as it being *your* fault (""you would get jealous"")...just gross.

Even if nothing happened with this other girl (which the lies make very suspicious), he's shown such blatant disrespect for you and the relationship here. The trust in the relationship has been broken to the point where you've started snooping on him.

Next time he responds with a weirdly timed ""I was dozing"", or dodges your questions, your first assumption will be that he's meeting up with girls and hiding it again (because *he* broke the trust). Which is a pretty crappy foundation for a relationship.

Only you can decide if this relationship is worth the time, effort, and energy required to rebuild trust and get back to a healthy state. It wouldn't be worth it for me, especially at your young age."
375,How will you prevent that from happening? You really need to nip this one in the bud now and tell her she isn‚Äôt welcome past December. 
376,"It is time to find a new trainer.  Your trainer has crossed the line and is no longer a professional.  Plus, he is getting paid to hit on you.  He has to go - now.

If you are employing your trainer directly and not through a gym then tell him that you are moving on.  Your safety has to come first. "

380,"You may need to start calling him out when he does it.

""I'm not going to come up with two ""projects"" this week because I don't need you managing my time like a parent. If there is something you'd like us to work on together we can discuss it when I'm not at work and figure out details together as a team""

This is definitely something the husband should be acting as a buffer on."
382,"I got married at about the same edge, so we could stay together as we joined the military. It was a similar situation - we just decided to do it, bought a cheap ring at Wal-Mart, and drove to Vegas.

I didn‚Äôt just marry him for convenience. At the time, it was the most in-love with anyone I had ever been, so it just felt like what I was *supposed* to do.

I didn‚Äôt end up joining, but he went through with it. He was sent off to tech school for three months, and midway through I moved out to be with him.

I don‚Äôt know if it was the clarity of being on my own for a few months or something that happened while he was in Basic, but when we reunited, I realized that something had changed. We weren‚Äôt as compatible as we once were. I was so excited to get out there and see him, but once I was there... something just felt *wrong*.

He was gung-ho to start the family life all his coworkers had, regardless of the state of the relationship. There‚Äôs a lot of pressure in the military to get yourself a wife and start popping out babies. We fought a lot, I suspected he was interested in someone else, I was depressed because I had basically nothing to look forward to besides being a military housewife to a guy I was slowly starting to realize I just didn‚Äôt like as much as I thought I did.

Without my knowledge, he accepted an arrangement that would put us in Okinawa for at least 10 years. I was excited in a way, but the sense of foreboding that was growing in me started ringing like an alarm bell. It just felt wronger and wronger.

I don‚Äôt remember exactly what set it off, but something in me just snapped, and I told him I wanted a divorce. I didn‚Äôt hate him, but I just knew that I wasn‚Äôt where I was supposed to be, and having kids was definitely not going to make it better. I figured any kids of mine deserved two happy, fulfilled parents - and they weren‚Äôt going to get that in that relationship.

So I left. I found out that he was dating someone else almost immediately - and I was surprised to find that I was happy for him.

He went off to Okinawa and had a great time. I went home and lived with my mother for a while, focusing on my own career. Time went by, and I met a man, and fell so powerfully in love that it dwarfed the feelings I had felt for my first husband, or anyone else. I realized I had only gotten married in the first place because I didn‚Äôt even know a love like *this* was possible.

When he told me he didn‚Äôt want kids, it threw me for a loop - because I didn‚Äôt even *know* that was an option. I just thought I had to do that eventually. It seems silly now, looking back, that I didn‚Äôt even actually know if I wanted kids or not, but it was really just a sign of how little I knew about myself at that age. Some people just *know* they want kids, and I never felt like that, but it had never occurred to me that I even had a choice in the matter.

It‚Äôs now 16 years later. That man has been my husband for 8 years now, and we‚Äôre deliriously happy. He‚Äôs snoozing with the dogs as I write this. My career ended up taking off, and I now run a successful business. I even have an employee!

That first marriage feels like a lifetime ago, but I reflect on it sometimes. I can see in retrospect that there was no way to make it work, no way I could have been as happy there as I am now. I wish him the best, but I am forever thankful we went our separate ways.

I don‚Äôt really know why I typed out this incredibly long and pointless story, except to say that you have *so* much time to figure out *exactly* the life you want for yourself - there is so much happiness out there for you if you go and take it. There is life after divorce, and there is someone out there who wants to build a truly happy life with you.

"
383,"Thank you. You're right. We do have boundaries in our relationship, oddly enough he wanted to talk about them and we did agree on things and this sort of behavior is one of them.

I like this approach a lot better "
384,[deleted]
385,"I really agree with you. I think I‚Äôm too codependent and it‚Äôs taking a toll on my self esteem. I‚Äôve gone to college but I don‚Äôt have the transportation right now to get to or from a place of work. He‚Äôs having his car sent out in the next few weeks which will give me my car back. 

My husband is living his dream job... he got accepted into MARSOC which is the elite of the Marine Corps. I guess I felt like I would be here to support his dreams and put my life on hold because it‚Äôs the military... it‚Äôs a lifestyle but it‚Äôs not going to last forever. I want kids more than anything. That‚Äôs what I meant when I said I thought we were building a life together. 

I guess my main thing is I don‚Äôt know if this is something that is serious enough to warrant me leaving him or if we can work through this. From an outside perspective it‚Äôs so easy to say leave, but I only ever wanted to get married once. To get divorced this fast from someone that I really love and thought I would spend my life with is a really devastating thought. "
386,"Gosh, I can't think of anything more romantic for your first time than having sex when you don't want to in order to prove your love! I mean, honestly, think about how that would play out. Women need to be relaxed and turned on to enjoy sex, but you wouldn't be, of course, because you'd be feeling like you're violating your own values, and you wouldn't be emotionally connecting with your partner - doesn't sound like that's a dealbreaker for him, but it would surely bother you. It sounds *miserable*. 

Look, you set a boundary and he keeps trying to cross it. He's young. You're young. You don't feel ready for sex and he does. Either he has to respect your choice, or you need to walk. I know you don't want to, but try to be open to the advice you get here, because most of us are older and have been in numerous relationships, and we've learned about what works and what doesn't. And what patently does not fucking work is a man trying to force a woman into having sex (or vice versa). 

If he doesn't respect you on this major issue that concerns your actual physical autonomy, what's the next one he won't respect you on? This is a big red flag. Men who don't respect the word ""no"" have deep issues, ones that usually end up harming the women they're with. 

Where do you go from here? Well, you tell him that, for the last time, you're not going to sleep with him before marriage. You tell him that you're not ready and sex should never happen between two people who are not ready and joyful. You tell him you don't need to sleep with him to prove your love. Either he listens or he doesn't, but if he doesn't, to quote Maya Angelou, ""When people show you who they are, believe them."" "
387,Its stories like this that sadly remind me people can tear another person apart just so they can feel slightly better about themselves. 
388,Underrated comment - this guy sounds like an asshole.
389,"He's talking to me but barely. I get the sense his wife is royally pissed and is pushing him to avoid me, too. "
390,"‚ÄúWhen you get home, we're having words. You think you can call me trashy and get away with it? You are wrong. I'll be waiting for you when you get there.""

With what, the Spanish Conquistadors? 

Good grief, what a drama llama. Just ignore her and chill for awhile. Then tell her, personally, you don't respond to empty threats and if she is willing to have a conversation about this, fine, but digging into the past to drudge up how she justifies her actions isn't a part of that. "
391,"&gt; He will claim that he can't help me

Something super important I've seen mentioned is that your partner doing their fair share isn't ""helping you"". Being an adult means doing chores, regardless of it you're tired or you didn't sleep good. 

I think you need to gently call him out on his bullshit and put your foot down here. 

When he tries to one-up you, call it out. ""Why are you trying to one-up me? This isn't a competition.""

How to frame the cleaning conversation is much more difficult.... for some reason, often just because the person doesn't want to, when called out to do their fair part many partners throw a tantrum. But, it's really unfair to you. Would he hire a maid?"
392,"Do not tell your fiance that you don't find her attractive. Oh my god. Don't do it, dude.

How important physical attraction is in a relationship depends entirely on you and your partner. Physical attraction can absolutely evolve over a period of time. I find my husband physically attractive now in a way that I didn't when we were first together. Is sex important? If so, does your sex life satisfy your needs? If yes, then... man, you're all set.

Edit: I missed OP's paragraph about this being due to cultural pressure. I still say *don't tell her*, but that changes things a bit."
393,"He is almost 40 and he has a temper tantrum like a toddler because he was told 'no.'

He is not a stable person, he is always going to threaten to leave you when you do something that displeases him. He is emotionally abusive and controlling.  

You are better off seeing a therapist and even moving without him. Get to know yourself as an individual and an adult and then figure out if you are really ok with having someone who uses your love as a weapon to control you."
394,"I'm here as an old happily married guy to give you a note from your future:

Don't marry someone that isn't sure they want you. Marry someone that would move heaven and earth to be with you.

I think you need to pull yourself together long enough to have one conversation with your fiancee, and it should be *very* short and sweet.

Something like: ""Anyone I would marry wouldn't have second thoughts about me, feel like I'm not good enough, and be flirting with other guys. So I'm here to tell you the wedding is off, and so is our relationship. I hope you have a good life and find whatever it is that you are looking for that you feel is better than me.""

And then I'd literally hang up the phone and go drown your sorrows with your buddies over a beer. Try to get some sleep, try to eat right, and just keep putting one foot in front of the other.

In a few weeks you'll likely feel a lot better, and be a lot more sure about your decision. But you can't marry this girl."
395, You need to remove penis from being the star of the show. Foreplay is. He doesn't get to turn at your knobs until your wet enough for him to jam his dick in and blow his load. If he isn't willing to commit to more foreplay put the breaks on penetration.

397,Sometimes it does take a stranger on the internet to tell you what you already know but don‚Äôt want to believe. Thank you. 
398,"I'm very sorry for your loss. To combine that with an SO that is unsympathetic and whiney is awful.

It sounds as though he picked up his ""empathy"" from his family - instead of ""sharing"" a story of someone else's death, how about a sincere gesture to let you know they're thinking of you?

This is not something that can be fixed. How dare he make comments about how your family should be dealing with things, that is the height of being an obliviot.

I think that it would help you immensely if you broke up with him."
399,"&gt; You shouldn‚Äôt have sex with people you don‚Äôt trust.

400,"Especially marital rape! Like, that wasn't even a crime until embarassingly recently. A frightening fraction of people still don't think you can rape your wife. Its astonishing that he got convicted at all. If it's truly a false conviction then he must have had the worst lawyers on the face of the earth, and also terrible luck."
401,This is so healthy and self-aware I can barely stand it. Please continue being the emotionally intelligent kid-with-a-crush so many of us did not manage to be:D
402,Op should also postpone moving in with her GF until they have handled this type of behavior. It's going to be a lot harder if they are living together.  
403,"This is not ""hygiene."" *If it were her hygiene everyone would be getting ill.* 


It's pretty questionable on your part to think she has *anything* to do with your symptoms when *no one else has them* and *you have a diagnosis*.  "
404,"He needs to realize that when you're parenting a small child, the standard timeline for ""getting stuff done"" goes out the window. That's part of the parenting schtick, and something he has to get used to.

What has really helped me and my husband is getting baby on a schedule, which you can start to do in another month or so. And sticking to that schedule very consistently. Once baby has more consistent nap times and bed time, you will both know when you have free time. And that gives you an idea of when the two of you can have time together, or apart.

Finally, personality can be a factor if he is more introverted. He might need bigger chunks of time to be alone without interruption, that you need to be aware of. My husband is like that, so it's just a thought.

Good luck!"

409,"I agree with you except up until that OP should leave the house when Jane and Jim come over.

412,"it seems self explanatory to me. She‚Äôs never been in love/a serious relationship. She was surprised by your confession, because nobody has ever said that to her, and you‚Äôre supposed to be in a casual hookup relationship. It just caught her off guard. Sounds to me like she probably does have feelings for you as well, but doesn‚Äôt know how to handle the situation. She‚Äôs scared because it‚Äôs so new to her, and sudden. Just give her time, don‚Äôt pressure her. If you don‚Äôt want to continue to just hookup, then tell her that you‚Äôd like to give her some space to think things over and she can come to you and let you know how she feels about you. She probably didn‚Äôt expect to catch feelings and is now unsure of what to do. "
413,"That's how egregious your situation is. Normally there's some debate, some wiggle room. Not here. 

You need to do what's right for you, because if you do what she wants it will never, ever, EVER be enough."

420,You should want this to be the end.
421,"Do you have a written agreement with her? If not, I would discuss getting one in place, with stipulations like fees on late payments, guests, and damage. The reason I suggest a written agreement is that arguments with family easily devolve into the personal and irrelevant - once you have a written record of what you expect of her as a tenant, it will be easier to hold your ground. 

Instituting this will probably be a little messy, but I don't think you can address these things without some tension and hurt feelings. Your SIL clearly feels entitled to treat you guys like parents who have no choice but to put up with her, rather than other adults who deserve to have their space and property respected. She's going to be upset when you correct that perception, but the sooner you set and enforce boundaries, the easier it will be for all of you to navigate your living arrangement comfortably. 

And if she still doesn't grow up and start behaving responsibly with a contract, it'll be easier to evict her with a paper trail. "
422,"You get an annulment. And about the other wives, well, would you want to be told? I sure would."
423,"Thanks! We've been talking about evicting her, but she was supposed to move out in December anyway, so we thought we should talk to her first.

She did make a concerning comment that made me think she's planning on staying longer, but we definitely won't let that happen."
424,"Yes, if your girlfriend has a problem shutting him down, then that itself is a problem and is a major cause for concern. If both of you are interested in your relationship, you shouldn't tolerate someone trying to invade it.

As others have said, your gf needs to distance herself from him. And she can't deflect. She needs to be clear ""Stop asking me out, I am never going to date you. You're being disrespectful to me and my bf"""
425,"I would add to this putting your phone on mute or somehow muting notifications from these texts on your phone. If you have a smartphone, there's often a way to do that."

435,"You could tell him ""hey I'm a really sensitive sleeper and I've been hearing noise from your room late at night- the walls are super thin! Could you try to keep it down after x time? thanks!""

436,You did the right thing. 
437,"Well....it's ULTRA gross that he thinks that you're going to get ""loose"" from using a toy. That's ignorant and borderline misogynistic. Do any other muscles in the body become ""loose"" with use? No. If I could scream one thing in a megaphone that the entire world would hear and believe, it's that repeated penetration DOES NOT AFFECT THE VAGINA MUSCLES' SIZE. Jesus. Christ. on. a. Cracker. That's some adolescent paranoia. 

It's also not ""cheating"". Cheating is almost universally defined as spending your time, energy, and physical affection on someONE (living being) other than your partner. Since you specifically got these items to use WITH him, he's being an immature, jealous, jerk. "
438,"Ugh 100% this. I know she‚Äôs bugging me because she knows damn well her son isn‚Äôt going to take the reins on anything.

WTF? I let them take my daughter out of school for a week to take her on a vacation because I thought they needed to spend time together FFS. 

I like the idea of responding with ‚ÄúYup, Tell (Ex) to send me the details and I‚Äôll be there.‚Äù I‚Äôm not shutting her down but putting the ball in their court. "

441,"If he was a diabetic who refused to take his insulin and preferred dramatic sugar lows and comas, you'd insist he seek professional help or at some point you'd stop going out to eat with him. 


He is suffering from some sort of mental anguish and distress, whether this is anxiety or a panic attack or narcissistic delusions or whatever. But since you can't control him and only have power over your continued involvement, I would tell him that the only way you will continue to stay involved is if he attends therapy with you and/or on his own. Going with him to a few sessions could be helpful because you could help lead the conversation and also give you a chance to talk about your feelings too. If he refuses, that is entirely his decision. But you are not responsible for him, especially if he is refusing help and solutions to his problems.

448,"Growing up in poverty shaped her, and it's a hard mindset to shake.  Have you ever heard of elderly people being cheap or thrifty?  A lot of them recall some hard childhood years during the great depression.  Maybe your girlfriend has some kind of guilt for living comfortably now, because she knows how many people will never experience the luxuries she is growing accustomed to.

I would say just try to be patient with her.  Focus on the positives like working to make a comfortable future for yourselves and your future children.  Also, if you're in a position to do so, talk to her about making charitable donations, or donating your time to help those less fortunate.  She might have a better attitude towards money if she sees it going to help people with whom she still identifies."
449,"It is ok for him to not want sex. At all, or with you in particular. 

It is not ok for him to presume that your sex life must end to support his choice. 

But ultimately, you have to decide for yourself if shared sexual intimacy is important enough to you to continue to seek sexual connection with others, either while continuing this relationship or ending it. You have considerable personal power in this situation. "
450,"This is actually emotionally abusive and he admitted it. He gets personal enjoyment from seeing you cry, so he makes you cry. 

You've already tried talking to him directly about it and nothing changed. He knows what he's doing, he doesn't care how you feel, and he's experiencing zero negative consequences. 

Imo, there's nothing in the world that could compensate for that behavior. Once a day is outrageous.

Edit: You've been with this guy for 4 years so I guess this is your new normal. But imagine being with a guy who respects your feelings and *doesn't* intentionally make you upset at least once a day. They are out there, in spades. "
451,I called my husband and asked him to come home. I sent one text to my BIL asking him to leave me alone and told him I didn't want it and in his response he basically acknowledged that (even though he immediately dismissed it).
452,"Can I just say you sound like the IDEAL office mate? I‚Äôm 30F and have worked in environments with Susie-esque personalities, and it is SO DRAINING. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing; you‚Äôre safely in the right, and she can either get with the (quiet and professional) program or get herself a new job."
453,"Hi there.

This one is simple. Go."
454,"your sister is 19 and already stealing from and taking advantage of your grandma to the tune of $1500. if you let this slide it's going to get worse, and there is a lot of time left for it to get a LOT worse."
455,"I missed that first post, but all things concerned, it turned out for the best. They seem like a bunch who knows how to enjoy the life - drama free. Good for them! 

That TLDR, though... cherry on the top! "
456,"Honestly I would make Tee move out, following your local tenant law. He sounds like a useless roommate, my understanding of what you wrote is that he doesn‚Äôt pay his full share of rent, and he‚Äôs incompetent. If his parents are so worried about his well-being, they can baby him themselves. Then block them, they‚Äôre awful. "
457,"I also wear a silicone ring due to my job. I used to switch it out with my actual wedding band but honestly, the silicone ring is a lot more comfortable. And if it gets lost or broke, I'm not out much money."
458,"Please don‚Äôt ever steal or hide Booey from him again, he was rightfully upset and I hope you apologized sincerely. The situation is indeed unusual, maybe bordering on the edge of unhealthy. Instead of focusing on keeping him away from Booey, I think it‚Äôs better to talk to him about his feelings and perception of Booey, how she helps him deal with stressful situations. You‚Äôve already noticed a pattern - talk to him about why he feels so anxious and maybe explore together some other exercises to manage anxiety and depression, along with having the bunny and take small steps, e.g. leave her home on a trip to the grocery store and back. Maybe give her a special designated place in his bedroom (maybe with lock and key) so he feels safe that nobody will touch the bunny. He is strong for not caring what other people think, very connected to his emotional needs and recognizes when a solution works or not, but maybe he focuses too much on the bunny as his only source of comfort and hasn‚Äôt realized he can do other stuff too. This process would ideally happen guided by an experienced therapist who shows empathy and an understanding of his case, but the parents, the child and the therapist all need to work together, maybe even involve his gf somehow. This can be overcome gradually and he sounds like he is still highly functioning albeit with the bunny by his side. Don‚Äôt be too harsh on him, please. Show him kindness and patience and keep hope that he will outgrow the bunny. Good luck! "
459,"&gt; Also, when do I stop enabling her? Do I take back my car and say: ""If you had $400 to spend on entertainment and clothes this month, you can fix your car without my help""? (She actually went to that expensive dinner, bought shoes while driving my car because her's is broken down, which feels like she is taking advantage of me).

Yes.

$15 an hour is a LOT to blow away with absolutely no financial responsibilities. She's thirty-one? Time to grow up."
460,"a) You and your wife need to stop supporting her brother financially b) It's absolutely not a good time to bring another child into your family if you are not only struggling financially but have barely any time to actually see the kids you do have c)Your wife is unwilling to work to help pay the bills, so she can wait and d) She's 26.... she has at least 10 years before having kids actually will be hard. "
461,"It's not ""unacceptable"" to live with your parents at 26, but it's probably keeping you from learning some necessary life skills, and it could make it difficult to get into a serious relationship (if you want that).  I would personally be very wary of dating someone who still lived with their parents by choice at 26 because I'd be worried they didn't know how to cook, clean, etc. and would expect me to be their new mom if we ever moved in together.  If you want to stay with your mom for a while, it would be good to make sure you still have the life skills you need to live on your own (and potentially be a good partner one day), like cooking, cleaning, making and sticking to a budget, etc."
462,"If you can take it, this will either 

A) help you get over him

Or

B) make it even more difficult to trust again in the future "
463,Also evict the brother. Funerals and wakes are important and he needs to grow up on his own before you can have a relationship with him again.
464,"Just call, if he calls you first say ‚Äúokay, I‚Äôm calling 911, I‚Äôll meet you at the hospital.‚Äù 

Then hang up before he can respond and immediately dial 911. Do not give him time to second guess his decision to call you. As soon as you make it clear that an ambulance will always be called if he says it‚Äôs an emergency requiring a hospital visit, he‚Äôll get the message that you are not going to put up with it being a lie. "
465,"I was really bitter at 21 because a guy i had been dating for 6 years all of a sudden told me he didnt want to marry me anymore....

5 years later I have met my person and we are happy and getting married. I am a much more whole person, and the best thing that guy ever did for me was set me free so that I can experience all that I did. 

Said all that to say..OP if you hade any concerns you did the right thing. And if you all decide to split as painful as it is, and as much as she will say/feel she hates you. In time it all makes sense. Good luck. "
466,"I'm confused, is this about what happened in the car or the weekend thing? Because if it's the car I'm kinda in her side. If you tell your partner they are treating you cruelly it better be something actually cruel, not just skipping a song on a playlist. Which, it sounds like was some petty revenge for YOU skipping a song that SHE liked first. The lack of adult communication in that scenario is astounding, from both of you, and you calling her cruel over it is ridiculously overblown. 

As for the weekend stuff, dude you sound so dismissive of her. You're talking about your needs and whether she can meet them or if you'll have to break up with her, no where in there do you try and consider her perspective of how much quality time she needs with a partner or what she even considers quality time. It's she does it your way or it's over, it's your judgement of the situation end story. You sound pretty arrogant to be quite frank. You are even dropping her bipolar diagnosis at the bottom when honestly it doesn't sound that relevant to any of these situations. It's normal and mentally healthy to get upset when your partner calls you cruel over a tiny slight. It's normal and mentally healthy to want to spend time with your partner that isn't constantly punctuated by work or studying. I'm sure her bipolar diagnosis has been difficult on both of you, but these examples are not at all illustrative of that so you need to take a giant step back and look at your own part I this before you start blaming it on all an ICD-9 code."
467,"&gt;I honestly don't think there's anything malicious in him, at all. So in how you paint it rather than ""refusal"" I'd argue it's indifference or even just... 

It‚Äôs said that the opposite of love isn‚Äôt hate, but indifference. Those tears you feel are from being confronted with the truth, and everything you wrote after that is a coping mechanism called mental gymnastics. "
468,"Tell her to think about how embarrassing it's going to be for her when it gets out how pathetically jealous she is, and it will if she keeps it up, because you are going to start warning your girlfriends about her unless she can convince you that that's not necessary. A good start would be apologizing to the girls she lied to.

I actually think you should tell your parents because that is troubling behavior in my opinion. She might need some help to navigate life right now, with some better coping tools."

470,"I don't blame you. I wouldn't have it! The whole ""all men cheat"" thing is so not true, &amp; I don't accept it. I don't know how/where bachelor/bachelorette parties ever started, but to me .. if you feel you have to sew your last oats before you marry me, then fuck off! Why would I want to marry someone who feels that way? I get it, you wanna go out get wasted, enjoy yourself, I guess whatever. But .. I'm a different breed really. I think, if you're getting married  to someone you genuinely love, it shouldn't be a 'last night' type situation, ya know? I've been with my boyfriend for 11 years, &amp; I really do have a good one. Good men ARE out there! And if you have any hesitation about the possibility he could ever cheat, run now! "
471,"Hi there honey. I'm very sorry you were hurt in the past, and came to accept so many toxic behaviors. What you describe as truths are not so. Like your therapist said, every story is a fable. We can live the story we want to. If I decide I am beautiful and act like it, I will show my best and most authentic version to the world, and will look beautiful to many people. If I believe I am ugly and hide myself, cover my face and stare at the ground, wear only unflattering clothes and never express myself, then I will look ugly to many people.

There is no such thing as someone who is universally beautiful. I think Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the hottest guys on Earth, yet many see him as a weird unkissable alien. So if we aim to be universally beautiful, we have already failed. Instead, we should aim to become better people: kind, honest, trustworthy, dedicated, hard-working... and so on.

You sound very kind from your words. Your boyfriend, on the other hand, indulged in creating negative fables about you. That is NOT OK. You are not overreacting. When you love someone, you want them to be the best version of themselves. So you struggle with insecurity, that is NORMAL, everyone is insecure, some people take it out on others, like your boyfriend did with you, and some just internalize it and do their best not to hurt anyone, like you. You're trying your best, and that is the best anyone can say. You're definitely not a slut, and even if you were, there is nothing wrong with that.

If I were you, I'd demand to see all of this material. If it will put a stake through your relationship, then so be it. Whatever can be destroyed with the truth deserves to be destroyed.

Remember that you are not this character, you're a complex human being, you are trying your best to love and be loved, and sadly you've met with many immature guys who don't know how to love themselves, and don't know how to love you. There is no such thing as being ""easy"", you trusted him and that is admirable, but now that you've seen the truth, don't bury it back again. Let it come to the surface. You're very strong, you've made it through this far on your own, and you can keep on growing and facing challenges. Lots of love your way."
472,"I think you are under reacting about everything else. She writes 2 articles a month, while you work full time and do everything around the house? Yelling and getting upset whenever things don't go exactly the way she wants it?


Needing a break for a few hours when you are sick is one thing...disappearing for two days and not being responsive? What if have a major medical issue? Do you plan on kids...do you think she will take care of them? If she were sick, do you think she'd be okay with you leaving for two days and not taking care of her?


And you are planning on promising ""in sickness and in health"" to this girl?"
473,"I was such a damn pleaser in my first ""everything"" relationship. I would let him get away with everything and killed myself in the process (he ended up manipulating that about me). I'm not saying she's like this at all, just beware that she could just want to make you happy while putting her feelings on the back burner. 

I also suggest inviting her along in the hopes you both gain a new friendship. It seems like the safest and most considerate option."
474,"‚ÄúDad, unless you seek mental health counseling, my family and I won‚Äôt be around you anymore. You‚Äôre choosing to continue to have panic attacks that make you, frankly, obnoxious and embarrassing only at times inconvenient for everyone. At worst you‚Äôre profane and scary in front of my wife and children. Regardless of what you think a psychologist/therapist/psychiatrist does, if you won‚Äôt help yourself, I‚Äôm not helping you anymore.‚Äù

The end. Don‚Äôt accuse him of faking. The last part is most relevant - you all need to stop helping someone who won‚Äôt help himself. "
475,Why are you dating someone with whom you are so fundamentally incompatible?
476,"Have you let your boyfriend know that you know that he was heavily flirting with another woman? You need to confront him and do it with conviction. Theres a lot of ways he will likely try and downplay this so you need to be firm. ""I saw a video of you with a woman literally all over you whom you were innappropriately touching. I will not tolerate this behavior from you. End of story"""
477,Mom sounds like a major micromanager who assumes responsibility for every aspect of dad. I'm assuming she does so for a similar or maybe slightly lesser degree with the kids. But yeah just stop going OP. 
478,"Umm... am I the only one here who sees a problem with this?

&gt;After posting I talked with my family and explained the situation, that I didn‚Äôt communicate well and whatnot. They were actually very understanding but the mood was still kinda awkward and unconfortable. Besides that, my youngest brother wasn‚Äôt on his best behaviour and he can hold a grudge. He‚Äôs 13 tho so I tried to cut off some slack(and knowing that F has been helping him with some girl problem I guess he was scared of losing a big sister figure), he was kinda short and sassy but nothing too bad.

You talked to your family *while* your girlfriend was still visiting? You created an ‚Äúawkward and uncomfortable‚Äù mood? And then you bring up your brother with a grudge but you never say *exactly* what he did? Please tell me if I‚Äôm missing something. What the fuck is wrong with you? Why on earth would you think it was appropriate to do this while your girlfriend was still visiting? Of course it was awkward and uncomfortable and of course she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel good‚Äù and y‚Äôall left early."
479,"Honestly, it just sounds like your husband finds the ring uncomfortable and doesn't like wearing it day to day, which seems fine!  I don't think he's trying to hide that he's married; I think he's been straight up with you about why he doesn't always wear the ring.  Some people just don't like rings/jewellery.

Could you start considering the necklace he wears all the time his marriage jewellery?  Or if he would like to wear a ring, maybe y'all could find a thinner/lighter one for everyday use and keep the actual wedding ring for special occasions?"
480,"You should leave BECAUSE of your son. It's safer for him to grow up without an abusive parent in the household, and safer for you to give him all the support he needs.

Your parents should be proud of you for having the courage to leave a bad partner. Maybe talk to them soon / before you tell your husband so you can arrange a place to stay with your son?

Either way I know it's hard but you can do it &lt;3 You and your son will be better off without him."
481,This. Waving a gun around is no joke. It will likely escalate. 
482,Certainly don‚Äôt want it to be like this
483,"I'm 26. My closest friends and I sometimes go for 3+ months without talking to each other. It's normal and it's a part of growing up.

That being said, if you're the only one who every initiates, then it could just be that the people you thought were your friends aren't really your friends. And that's normal too. Lots of people grow apart in their early 20s."
484,"This.

OP, Jesus Christ my dude, wake the fuck up. This is your wife and newborn here, you should 1000% believe your wife when she says she feels unsafe and do something, anything you can about it. Different grocery store or no (you have zero obligation to reach out to this guy personally, or his employer, or explain on behalf of your wife her feelings), you need to show that you support and trust your wife's instincts here. 

Or, hey, you can go do the grocery shopping for a while so your wife doesn't need to put herself in situations where she feels unsafe. Just a thought."
485,"Molluscum is a contagious virus that spreads easily via contact, and is very common in children.  Usually, after having an initial outbreak (which can last 2-12 months), the lesions resolve and do not recur.  Sometimes, we will treat with topical medications, cautery, or even surgical removal if necessary.  So, if you have not been exposed, there's a good chance that you will develop the lesions.

Now - the key part that hasn't been mentioned. In an adult with recurrent molluscum, it is important to rule out an underlying immunodeficiency. It is a little concerning that he has recurrent molluscum over multiple partners. How long has this period been?  Because his doctor should make sure there isn't something else causing these recurrences.
Source - physician."
486,He's not amazing. It's amazing that you haven't kicked him to the curb.
487,"The correct answer when someone puts a price tag on friendship is, ""Ok, bye!""

&gt; We have been friends for over a decade

The fact that you have a past does not guarantee or require that you have a future."
488,"This sort of broke the back of any argument for staying with him.

&gt; He only does these things once or twice a day

**only** once or twice a day? How long would this relationship last if you started provoking him to the point of anger or crying once or twice a day?

He's abusing you, *constantly,* for his own amusement. He doesn't want a girlfriend, he just wants something to provoke and toy with for a laugh.

Leave him as soon as possible."
489,"I don't think it's cognitive dissonance.  She sees these people as HAVING wealth, where she had the WORK for it, regardless of their personal life stories.  I grew up poor and I still have a chip on my shoulder about people who grew up with money."
490,"Why not talk to your girlfriend about it? That way at least she knows how you feel, even if she doesn't want to address it with her parents or feels she can't do anything about it. Tell her that the way her parents behave at restaurants is concerning to you and you don't enjoy it, though you appreciate their generosity. At least then she can be on your side for getting out of going out with them "
491,"Nope, no marriage. No sharing finances. Have a talk with her that this is a big issue why you're hesitating about marriage. She might have a short term change then.

On the other hand, this has been going on at least 5 years. In that time, with your help, she still has managed to only gain more debt under circumstances where she should've been able to limit some of that (no rent). This sounds quite incurable. Maybe she's not the partner you should have a family/marriage with."
492,Can I ask what is good points are? Because I don't think any guy who won't sit with you in ED could be worth it (unless they're super-medical-phobic) 
493,"This is it. He‚Äôs trying to butter her up (paying the car payment) then use that to guilt OP later, when he starts to suck all her resources (I did this amazing thing for you, and you can‚Äôt help out your ‚Äòol dad?)
Once it starts, it won‚Äôt stop. Back away."
494,Yes it's disgusting. He sought you out BECAUSE he thought you were underage. He's a predator.
495,"The best approach is to say, ""honey, I think we should cut down on our drinking.."" And then do that. What's the point of saying sorry if you stay in circumstances that will cause it to happen again?"
496,"Thanks! The world is full of great people like all of you. We pull each other out of tough spots and when it's our time to need help, there will be people who can help us too. "
497,"You've been through so much, I'm so sorry you and your family have had such a hard time. Has your mother been through grief counseling for the loss of your brother? I think that's coloring a great deal of what she's feeling."
498,"This. Been through this scenario with an older male relative. Family instituted a no full hugs rule for him. The young ladies in the family were told about Dementia etc and told it‚Äôs ok to refuse a hug. To intercept the hands and give an arm pat instead and don‚Äôt be alone with him. No kisses. Period. 

Want to add: when he was gently/compassionately confronted about the behavior he would sort of snap out of it and be confused. But instantly he knew he had done something he wasn‚Äôt supposed to. It took that gentle nudge for his brain to get back where it was supposed to be. "
499,"&gt;Yes, I am grateful my mom and dad gave me hot food, fresh water, and my own bed to sleep growing up.  

AKA ‚Äúthe bare minimum‚Äù and the same as you get in jail! Any parent who fails to provide these basic necessities of life is committing child abuse. 

Quietly let your middle child niece know that you‚Äôll be there for her when she grows up and wants to get away from that toxic mess, and then give the rest of them the middle finger and go live your life around better people. "
500,"They‚Äôre just books! Who cares? She likes to read about this stuff. Maybe it tittilates her. Maybe it reminds her of a movie she liked as a kid. Maybe she‚Äôs curious. Maybe she has a friend who is into it and she wants to learn more. Maybe she likes history, or comparative religion. Maybe she‚Äôs...PLANNING YOUR HORRIBLE DEATH BY CASTING SPELLS TO MAKE YOUR PENIS FALL OFF AND WRAP ITSELF AROUND YOUR NECK TO STRANGLE YOU YOU WHILE YOU SLEEP!!! Come on. Just relax. Ask her about it. Bring up the internet search. Collect data first, then freak out as though it‚Äôs the year 1580. "
501,"Yes, tell him. 

If your roommate doesn‚Äôt have the self-restraint to not kiss you without warning, he probably will tell your bf if you don‚Äôt just to fuck things up. 

This is... sexual assault if you want to go that far. I would just be very annoyed though. 

Tell your bf and tell him you won‚Äôt be alone with your roommate. Ask that he respect the fact that you handled it and don‚Äôt go into ass kicking mode or whatever. Unfortunately your friendship with your roommate is basically over if you want to respect your relationship. Don‚Äôt live with him again when the lease renews. "
502,it's not actually funny.
503,"She had an emotional reaction because you said a relationship-changing thing and those can take you by surprise and be be tough to hear. Look at it from her perspective - she was going on all this time thinking things were kosher and platonic, so she probably feels pretty shocked and confused at the moment. She might have had a hard time telling you if she loved you back, because she loves you as a friend, but not in a romantic way. Going out for food and movies is the *friend* part of fwb. 

If you need to distance yourself from her now that's totally fair and reasonable. "
504,"If that's all it takes for him to ""rethink"" your relationship. Just cut him loose and move on. He already has too much doubt, and now thinks he can move on to something better. Just set him free, and move on. "
505,"First tell him your 2nd paragraph, give him a genuine apology, and then tell him this:

&gt; My husband is an amazing guy, he works very hard, and he is the nicest person you'll ever meet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully that will be enough, as it sounds like you're genuinely remorseful. 

&amp;#x200B;"
506,"You need it just as much for your sanity. Do not fall into the self sacrificing trap that so many young spouses do. You are important. Your identity separate from being a military spouse is important. So often people let themselves get caught up in it. 

My ex rode his bike when we were at Pendleton and it was a long ride. But it was good for him. He also carpooled on occasion. And we each had a POV but it saved money and lots of people do it. There are other options besides you sitting at home alone and depressed. "
507,"Your girlfriend isn't mad that you're playing video games with your dad, she's mad that you're spending less time with her. Have you told her that this is a matter of spending time with and bonding with your father, not just choosing video games over her?"
508,"Honestly, that‚Äôs a really childish experiment. If a friend of mine who reaches out to me suddenly stopped reaching out, I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre too busy or no longer interested. Some people are just the initiators in the relationship. If that bothers you, instead of playing games and testing them, you should have a conversation and ask them about it. You just ditched all your friends for a month and a half. You lost a petty game that only you were playing. "
509,"Not only does david deserve to know, but giving our loved one everything they want is not always the best way to be loving towards them. Allowing your sister to continue to hurt this guy who's only been good to your family will end up being worse for her and him. "
510,"&gt;Apparently, she posted to her story that I'm transphobic and a bigot

You need to cut contact with this person. She is not your friend. She's too unstable and abusive right now to be a friend at all.

"
511,"Depending on how drunk the friend was, I also wonder just how consensual the sex with an escort was."
512,"You and your partner seem very passive throughout this whole affair. She‚Äôs acting like a child in an adult world. You‚Äôre not ‚Äúacting parental‚Äù by holding her to basic adult standards. 


If a guest trashed my home I‚Äôd kick them out. You don‚Äôt have a SIL problem, you have a doormat problem. "
513,"1) Imagine your doctor taking angry poops.  That is always an attraction killer for me.  

2)  A lot of this will auto-resolve as time goes on and you see him less and less.  "
514,London is a multicultural city so there's no requirement or need to seem more British than you are.  Being American is cool. Trying to seem British is weird. You're being treated like a pet project. Tell her it makes you uncomfortable and would like it to stop and decide on her reaction how you want the relationship to proceed. 
515,Yeah and putting your head on boobies isn¬¥t submissive lol.
516,"This! Don't give him the opportunity to come up with some reason why you're lying just so he can save his other relationship. I would tell her also, she deserves to know. "
517,"This. Annulment. Get out now, before you lose any more time to this shithead or have children with him and are forced to deal with him for the next eighteen years. "
518,"The ""really big, really bad"" thing he had to tell you wasn't that he is actually 4 years older than you thought.  It was, ""I actually lied to you, and continued lying to you, for 3 years. I kept up the lie every birthday, and even let you plan a special holiday in honor of my 40th birthday, whilst knowing that I was 40 since before I met you. And I'm only telling you now when it's too late to change anything about the holiday, and now that you've made huge changes in your life that would make it harder for you to just break up with me.""   


Like, the age difference isn't that big a deal. Not when you're both well into your 30's and 40's. But...he had *so many* opportunities to come clean. And he didn't, until you were in a position where you are essentially stuck with him, unless you make another series of enormous changes to your life. And he never once said, ""Actually, I'm not actually turning 40, so this holiday doesn't have to be in honour of my birthday."" He just let the holiday get planned, until you're literally about to fly out in a matter of hours.  


I don't know this guy at all, whereas you've spent 3 years with him. I have no idea what he's like, or what kind of relationship you have together. But the kind of lie he spun, and the timing of his confession, feels pretty weird. It almost would have been better if he had just kept the lie going forever. "
519,"&gt; ‚ÄúI explained to her I'm not at 100% either, that it's not something I would even expect. There's always a .01% or whatever number chance that she does something, or she changes in some way that would just ruin everything for me and I'd be the one who gave up on us. The best you can have is knowing that you love the other person and working together to improve your lives. Is my outlook the odd one out here...?‚Äù


I mean...you‚Äôre not wrong but that was probably the worst one you could have said that. My advice would be:

* go to couples therapy. Learn to communicate better. It can‚Äôt hurt. 
* go on dates. Look dude, me and my husband are broke to and we still have dates. We don‚Äôt have to go out to have a good time. There are ways to have fun and be romantic w/out money. 
* make sure she‚Äôs *actually* happy with the sex. Don‚Äôt just assume. 
* learn more about custody and child support. It‚Äôs literally a google search away.

522,"My ex was like this. After I left him and started dating better people, I was amazed at how wildly off I had been when I'd said or thought:

* That I loved my ex so much. It turns out, I actually love my kind husband with a passion I couldn't have fathomed with my ex. 

* How good the ""good"" times had been. It turns out, the ""good"" times with my ex weren't that good. The best times with my ex were actually lower quality than a perfectly average time with my kind partner. 

* How much of a fuck up I was. It turns out, I'm not a fuck up, and nice people don't give a crap about the sort of things my ex gave a crap about. It wouldn't even occur to them to get mad at me about the things that angered my ex. Also, it is much easier for me to be a pleasant person when I don't have to live with an asshole.

* How I would feel if I left my ex. I thought I would feel terrible. Instead I felt relieved. 

* How hard life would be without my ex. It turns out, he was actually making my life needlessly difficult, and everything was easier without him.

Therapy is an important next step for you. Make sure to be honest with your therapist.

525,"So here's the thing:  When you foster animals, you take on the responsibility to do what's best for the *animal*, not for your own feelings.  I say this advisedly, because my wife and I foster cats for a local rescue, and we have had to make some heartbreaking decisions based on what was best for the *cat*, not what made us happy.

That dog is not a small-apartment dog, so *all other things aside*, if she plans to keep it, either she, or *you* and she,  *must* have a place that is big enough for the dog to have the space it requires.

The dog cannot stay in your current place.  If the two of you, or she alone, cannot afford a place where the dog will have enough room to be happy, then *she cannot keep it*.  That's not my rule, or yours; that's the covenant she made with the *dog* when she promised to care for it and do what was best for it."
526,"I'm a black guy from a pretty exclusively white community. I'm VERY familiar with that weird uncertainty that you're feeling. I've found it really is best to trust your guy and, above all else, be direct. Just call her out when she says something that you're interpreting as problematic, and then see what she has to say. If she says you look like someone, say ""I definitely don't see it, why do you think we look alike?"" If she says she loves Korean guys, ask ""ALL Korean guys? Every single one? What are you saying?"" Most effective of all, just straight up ask her if she likes you or if she likes the fact that you're Korean, and be prepared to elaborate why and how she makes you feel that way.

Calling her out is uncomfortable, but, if you're too uncertain to otherwise just break up with her, it might be worth it. That said, 9.5 times out of 10, I have found that when someone bring up my race or a race-specific comparison (like saying I look like black or mixed-race celebrities I realllllllllly don't actually look like), then my gut about them was right and they're more into their weird, fetishized ""idea"" of me than the actual, imperfect, but very real me."
527,"&gt; I don't judge, she knows what she's doing,

Feel free to judge. What she's doing is hurting her child.

That aside: I understand that you're friends with this woman, but recovering addicts of *any* type need to keep this advice to heart: don't let anyone drag you back. 

If she can get herself pills or something harder, she can get herself pot. She's trying to manipulate you into doing this with her and implicitly approving of what she's doing because she knows that what she's doing is harming someone else and she knows that's wrong.

Saying ""no"" can be hard--but that's all you have to say. ""No."" No, you're not buying her drugs. No, you're not responsible for what she does if you don't buy her drugs. No, you're not going to be manipulated by her."
528,"Give your family his email address and have them block him also.

And if he tells them you're an escort you can play it off like he's just harassing you and trying to upset your family. The only way they'd know it's true is if you let them know. He's obviously nuts, you can chalk it up to that."
529,"&gt; I have come up with a way to ""protect"" my husband from my Dad ""protecting"" me. Essentially, it will ensure if my Husband and I divorce (which I can't imagine) my husband will be legally entitled to half the house and I'll be the only one my Dad can go after for the loan.

Unpopular opinion, but I agree. I read the original post just now and this part stood up. Seems she is more concerned with protecting him and keeping him happy and comfortable in life than she is really about protecting herself. Her own family is willing to help her by putting 100k down while she will likely pay for the rest, but she is more worried he won't get half of a house he won't really put a cent into if he ever finds a better piggy bank even if it means screwing her own father. 

And he is now only going along with it not because he is worried this job is stressing and slowly killing you or this will be a better financial decision for your future together, but because some other person had to remind him he is going to lose his nice comfortable life otherwise. 

She might be the main breadwinner. But they are not a a team, his needs will always come first. Op your father is not being offencive, he is protecting the family money HE worked hard for! As any person should. As you should know better than anyone.  "
530,"Hey there OP. I just turned 47. I have been with my guy since I was 26. In my 20's, I didn't know what I wanted, regarding marriage and kids. As soon as I hit 30, I was just ready for the ring, the wedding, the babies.

Instead of doing the mature thing, like you did, my guy started stalling with reasons we couldn't have kids 'yet'. (better jobs/more money in the bank/better health insurance/fix up the house to be safe for babies). Every 'reason' he came up with, I busted my arse to fix. And he kept moving the goalposts.

The longer he put me off, the more of our friends and family that settled down and had babies, the more tightly wound I got about it. Our relationship broke down. We were *horrible* to each other. One day in a huge fight (over marriage and babies) I tossed at him ""You never meant to have kids with me! You're just trying to run my clock out!!"" Annnnd he admitted it. I was 37. Thought I was too old to find someone else and have kids. 

We're in the process of splitting now, after 20 years ago. I can't get past my anger and resentment. I think about the kids I didn't get to have every. single. day. The fact that I didn't leave him in my early 30's, when I was ready after 5 years together and he wasn't, is the single biggest regret of my life.

If he really, truly, wants to be a Dad, and you really, truly, don't want to be a Mom, there is no compromise. Eventually your relationship would suffer. One or the other of you would become angry and resentful. You shouldn't compromise on kids.

TL;DR - No. Not worth it, at all."
531,"Scary is the right word to use.

This man has been convicted of rape by the justice system. 

And he automatically believes the guy convicted of rape saying ""Oh no it was a mistake""?!

OP do not let your hope that this was a mistake make you ignore the reality.

How unfair to the victim, like all victims, to finally secure a conviction against her rapist (where only 10% of cases secure that conviction) and EVEN THEN to have her rapist's new partner and ex husband still taking the rapist's side?! WTF?!

edit: and I would strongly recommend distancing yourself from her, to protect your own sobriety. good luck. 

edit again: ultimately, you have absolutely no control over what this woman does - what you *do* have control over is whether you choose to help her fall off the wagon or not. Don't help her."
537,"Agreed.  To add on to what you said, I feel like if your 14-year old self would have been disappointed in your partner - but you love him or her *now* and are very happy with him or her - you should be thinking ""my 14-year old self was such an idiot - prioritizing stupid things like *height* rather than the amazing personality, charm, and love my fiance has for me!""

540,"Thank you. That's a good idea as well. I hope it doesn't backfire on me though. After the last outing my wife and I paid (which we weren't really prepared for but my brother and sister aren't really financially stable yet). And when I complained about my dad they accused me of being more upset that I had to pay instead of my dad's behaviors. I hate always being the ""bad guy"" here but my wife is not going to put up with the public scenes for long. And neither can I. "

542,"People sign prenups all the time, it's not offensive to keep some money separate during a marriage especially with a high divorce rates. I would take his offer in the exact way it's been offered, it's responsible to consider your finances together and separate. 

While I'm happy he conceded to moving to a more reasonably priced neighbourhood the contingency of ""fixing"" your depression seems strange. It mainly stems from you feeling trapped into providing this lavish lifestyle he couldn't afford without you with no linear move to another field of your passion that alleviates the work hours and stress. It seems like a circuitous route that won't end unless you fake being happy?

I genuinely hope you think about accepting your Dad's offer the way it's been posed, you aren't harming your relationship or not standing up for your Husband by making a financial choice. There is no malicious motive on your end or even your Father's, his thinking is sound on this trying to keep the equity fair. If you divorce what he paid into the house and had returned would be fair, and what you put in with the help of your Dad returned to you would be fair."
543,"I'm sure many other people will say something similar but I think you should be less concerned about your kid being bullied for living with a convicted rapist and WAY more concerned about your kid and ex-wife living with a convicted rapist. 

Everything in your post is based on the naive assumption that this guy was falsely accused but the fact is that a jury of his peers (assuming a jury trial) looked at the facts and found him guilty of this crime. Refusing to push back on this assumption out of fear of upsetting your vulnerable ex could be a huge mistake. If you really still consider her a friend you should be pushing her to put her and your child's safety first. "
544,"You are getting a lot of (frankly bad) advise in this thread, mostly from people who claim they are just like you, saying that this is totally not a problem. People will absolutely see this as you being distant. If you are ok with that and possibly losing old friends, or not forming stronger bonds with new friends, then whatever.  

But you seem to have a worry that this will affect current and future relationships, and I would tell you, you're correct.  People will see it as you not even taking the bare minimum to maintain a relationship.  Being the one who constantly puts in energy into a relationship is a shitty feeling. "

547,"&gt; My sister gets upset when I don't want to babysit when she wants to go out with her friends. Recently, she called me ungrateful because I refused to watch her daughter when she wanted to go out. 

The core issue is that your sister is way too immature to have a child. A working single parent with a young child shouldn't have the free time to hang out with friends with the frequency you're implying. She is projecting being ungrateful onto you, since she's successfully turned her child into the responsibility of at least two other people yet seems to only complain that *everyone else* isn't doing enough."
548,"Please listen to this OP. My parents decided to compromise as well and I was actually born in a state that legally allows you to have _two_ first names. 

So let's say my name is Maria Eleanor Campbell. My birth state recognized Maria Eleanor as _one complete_ first name even though they are not hyphenated, but the state that I currently reside in doesn't. Therefore, my drivers license and passport are technically different. Want to know the best part? My parents gave me a different nickname that they used for all their friends and family, and that I used until high school - let's say it was something like Erin. 

I now go by only Eleanor (middle and junior high bully was named Maria, go figure). So people in college know me by half of my first name, my family calls me by a nickname that was never derivative of my original names, and I have exhausted every possible way to explain to people how my name works. 

Don't get me started on forms and emails and just general professional introductions - hell even picking up to-go orders since my cards have my full name. And that doesn't account for the headache with every teacher throughout school. I would have substitute teachers and professors just call me Maria just because they would always forget what I go by, since every attendance sheet would look like Maria E. Campbell. It is exhausting, and it is something that parents who had ""normal"" names don't think about. Don't kick the can down the road so much that you put the burden on your kid, my parents regret taking the easy way out just because of how much it is a nightmare for me. "

But some explicit reason has to be there. "
553,"It seems off to me that you work two jobs while he works two days a week. There must be a better way to compromise.

Continue to help him find what he wants, but in the meantime he needs a full time job, not a tutoring gig two days a week. 

And I know this is really common in this sub, but therapy. He seems rather depressed. "
554,"Agreed. Plus, the name itself may just be a legit dud. My mom was under a lot of pressure from her family to name me Gertrude, after her grandma.

556,"My dad raped my mother frequently, one of my strongest childhood memories of him involves him sitting on my mothers torso while she lies on the floor as he methodically punches her in the face over &amp; over in front of the living room window. A neighbor walks past and can see my dad but not what's going on, he waves, my dad stops and waves back all smiles. He waits till the neighbor continues on and then starts punching my mother again.

Everyone LOVED my dad. I never heard anyone say a bad word about him, he was charismatic and charming, and terrorized my mother and myself nightly. One night I was certain he was going to kill her this time, and I crawled out of the window much like u/ Throwaway999230 and got a neighbor to call the police. My dad was SO charming and convincing when the police showed up he got them to believe I'd had a terrible nightmare and that was all that had happened. He put my unconscious mother in bed and tucked her up and told them she'd taken a Valium and was out like a light. I will never forget watching them fall for his effortless lies, or what he did to me after they left.

OP if this Josh guy has been convicted, it is almost a certainty that he did what he is accused of, and absolutely not worth disbelieving if you love your child. Your ex can make whatever choice she wants, but putting your child around this dangerous man is something you should be losing your mind about. "

561,"He sounds like a narcissist to me, and the refusal of therapy is the clincher. (Oh, and I just noticed that he deliberately chooses times when you normally would be paying attention to someone else, like your mom's birthday. Classic.)  I know that if I was having massive panic attacks and ruining family vacations, I would seek out some kind of help. If he's not trying to get help, or if he refuses help, that says to me that he wants the attention, not the cure. I had a narcissistic dad and he always wanted to be the center of attention.  If he wasn't getting enough attention for his tastes, he would start yelling or insulting people.  Looks like this is your dad's version. If your siblings get mad at you, tell him that he refuses to see a doctor for his problem, and you can't deal with it if he won't deal with it.  (Also check out r/raisedbynarcissists )"

I appreciate our friendship for what it was, but I'd rather put it behind me since at this point it's just hurtful.

Then I'd just not pick up if she tried to call/probably not respond to her texts. She knows what she's doing, she's been lying about it and doing it anyway so you don't need to help her deal with it. Just put it down and walk away."

569,"There is something about this entire situation that doesn't make sense to me. Essentially, I don't see you getting even close to what you want (a stable home, stable finances, luxuries, fun nightlife, expensive vacations etc.). Things that make you happy. It's fine if your husband wants to stay in hostels (hell, I like hostels too), but if that's not your idea of a good time, then you guys have divergent values. You spent almost the entire post defending your husband and your relationship, but very little of it focusing on your own desires and how to get out of this feeling of being shackled.

&amp;#x200B;

As for what your dad is doing, I wouldn't do what you are trying to do. Imo, if he gives you 100k and is asking you to keep his money from your husband, you should respect it. He shouldn't be telling you what to do with YOUR money, that's your business, but if he is willing to give you the money and you are going to accept it, don't try to connive your way around it. I don't even know why you are trying to do it! Your husband doesn't even need it! He is ok with the simple life!

Then the wife is stuck at home because she's somewhere completely new. No friends, no job, no prospects of anything good happening in her life. Their entire lives are HIS job and HIS whims. Cheating (because yes, setting up a future date with someone in a text IS cheating in my book). The wife thinking ""it's OUR car, OUR money, I'll support HIS success"" and the husband is only thinking ""MY car, MY money, MY career."" It's so clear that even if she has this dedication to their marriage, the husband doesn't feel that way at all.
  
My years as a military spouse were terrible. We barely made it out married, and that was just sheer luck honestly. We had already been married a few years before he enlisted and we still weren't ready for the bullshit that comes with a military lifestyle. And then it was a nightmare once my spouse left the military, as it shook up everything once again. Some folks can navigate those changes with ease, but definitely not everyone can."

579,"Well in that case, I think it's worth trying at least once to have the issue out in the open. As it seems like the friendship is on the rocks anyway it's worth at least trying to salvage it. 

It seems to me that you could try contacting the husband and tell him that you have sensed that something is wrong and that he has cut down his contact with you and you would like to know why. 

I'm on the fence about how open you should be about what you've learned about his wife. I think perhaps it ought to be kept back thus giving him the opportunity to give you his take on what is going on unbiased by anything you might say. On the other hand he might not know his wife is avoiding you at work. 

Ultimately you might have to accept that his wife is blaming her failure on you and is sabotaging the relationship you once had, which is really sad. "

I'm not saying *you're* being abused because this isn't your mother or wife and clearly she's not directing it at you. But you're using the same logic every person on the planet uses to justify the abusive behavior of the people close to them. It's a myth that the *real* abusive people are the ones who have zero motivation other than they like to be mean and controlling. Almost all abusive people tend to be neurotic and have a ton of issues motivating their behavior. And that's why they often get away with said behavior. Because the people near to them understand those issues and use them to excuse the behavior. This is actually enabling, it's the reason these people never have to modify their behavior and change. And now everyone suffers."

605,"Just for future reference, a lot of girls that you take home are going to feel threatened by F. Is she your friend first? If not I'd introduce her as whoever's friend she was first and say ""but they've known each other so long it's like she's part of the family."" If she was your friend before anyone else's, I'd introduce her as ""this is our neighbor and really close family friend."" Sometimes close relationships like this do happen- it sounds like you don't have an actual sister (or did I miss something?), So of course your grandmother and parents enjoy having her around like the daughter they never had. But a lot of girls are going to find that threatening. 

Also, did you ask your ex what made her think that everyone wanted F and you to be together? There might have been something that you couldn't see that she had and I would consider it because I'm sure your family definitely wouldn't be unhappy to see you ending up with F. If there was something that they did like comment ""oh we always thought OP was going to move back home and marry F, but look at you!"" as a joke, then that would rightly make G feel insecure. I'd look at whether your family might have been extra nice to F at the time G was visiting and if they did treat you like you were married. It could be that she was seeing something that wasn't there, or it could be that something happened that rightly made her insecure. And if something did happen to make her insecure, I would talk to your family about it. You don't want them to (perhaps unintentionally) drive away all your future gfs because they favor F. If you really never develop feelings for F (or vice versa) then the person you do end up with deserves to feel like part of the family too."

To me, it sounds like you and he have a small difference when it comes to modesty and clothing choices.   While it is absolutely not okay for him to dictate your clothes, I think it‚Äôs very reasonable (and even healthy!) for him to express his discomfort to you.   

You don‚Äôt *have* to change anything.    You get to decide what to do here, now that he‚Äôs expressed his unease, but you don‚Äôt get to dictate what he ‚Äòshould‚Äô be comfortable with.   He gets to decide what he wants to do if his girlfriend dresses like you do, but not whether your style changes.  

If you did legitimately want to compromise, how about keeping your general style but ‚Äòtoning down‚Äô a bit.   For instance, you could wear a tight tank top instead of a bralette under the mesh.   It would look very similar but be a little less provocative, so that‚Äôs the sort of thing that might work.   

Again: you do not have to do this.   It is okay to decide that you don‚Äôt want to change anything.   Your boyfriend cannot and should not dictate your clothing choices.   But this is the sort of thing you can *choose* to do, to meet him halfway.   "

633,"&gt; He also gets jealous and pissed if I use toys (whether with him or not), so I don't really feel like I have an outlet. 

Ummmm yeah, this is a problem. Honestly, your husband sounds SUPER insecure, and it sounds like it may be manifesting in different ways (e.g., being embarrassed when you can't cum; being a controlling asshole about your sex toy use). For the record, I don't think you should listen to him about the sex toys. What you do on your own is NONE of his business, and it sets a really bad precedent if you let him control you. 

Honestly, I think you should stop having sex with him until you two can have an adult conversation about how to fix this. You're not getting what you need out of the equation - if you're not enjoying it as much as you want, don't do it. It's not fair to you to keep doing something you're not happy with just because he's happy with the status quo. The sad thing is that this is all very fixable - your hubby just doesn't seem interested in trying. For example, you using a toy while you two are together is probably the best way to make you cum. It sounds like he's so insecure he can't handle that. But that's his problem to take care of, not yours. So in the meantime, make yourself feel good (WITH the toys you enjoy - forget your husband's weird edicts). Your husband needs individual counseling, and you two need couples counseling to sort this out. Best of luck OP!"

She says ""no counseling,"" which means she doesn't want to fix it, she just wants to ""win"" the argument and she doesn't care how unhappy it makes you. It takes both people working together to solve relationship problems. You can't do it yourself, and she's unwilling. She's so unwilling, to the point where she doesn't even think saving your marriage is worth a one-hour appoint with a therapist. So that's something to think about - you're apparently just an inseminator and a provider to her, because she doesn't care about your opinions or your feelings. Do with that information what you will."
636,"You should go to couples counseling over this. Whatever name you agree on, I guarantee it won't be the end of the story. Go now."

And ultimately it‚Äôs completely ok to break up with someone because they decided no more sex. 

Sex makes you feel connected. Sex makes you feel wanted, attractive, desirable. Sex makes you feel loved. When your partner suddenly removes those pieces from a relationship, you lose big chunks of feeling connected, wanted, attractive, loved. It‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to feel like that loss is too much to accept. 

Good luck. "

643,"She agreed to a date because she wants to get to know you. That's great!

1)For a first experimental date, you don't have to go all out. Invite her somewhere that isn't super cheap (like fast food), but also not 5 star expensive and upscale. Somewhere in the middle. Maybe a cool local diner? 

2)What to wear ties directly into where you invite her. If you go somewhere fancy, don't show up in ripped jeans and a tshirt. Nice, darker wash jeans and a polo shirt with a collar looks pretty good in almost any situation. Add a nice pair of loafers and you are dressed for any occasion. 

3)Dealing with the anxiety and stress is going to be the tough part. Try to remember that she is a person just like you, not an object to be won. She isn't some higher being you should worship, she's a human with flaws and is probably nervous about this date too. 

This is going to sound dumb, but spend time every day talking to yourself in the positive. At home, to your mirror or just to empty space, say OUT LOUD ""I am confident. I am likeable. I'm an awesome person. I can talk to people."" It sounds really stupid, I know, but it works. How you think about yourself, positive or negative, affects how you act. 

Try to ask her questions about herself. Ask her what she is studying in school (unless you already know. Then ask her what her favorite part of what she studies is). Ask her about her tastes in music, ask her about her favorite movies. Ask her about books she likes or games she plays. Listen to her answers and ask follow up questions. Be prepared for her to ask you questions about similar topics, and answer them. Try not to get too fixated on one topic. 

Maybe get some of your friends together and try having some practice conversations in the time leading up to the date? "

One thing I hate is that society has adopted these terms so happily. Love should never be about status or looks. I dislike that she said she was ""settling"" with you, implying that you are beneath her. You aren't a reacher -- you have a relationship with someone you love and care about and she agreed to be in one with you. It isn't your fault for presuming she felt the same -- it's been 5 years! Being told she ""settled"" for you kind of uproots the entire basis of a mutually loving relationship. Why are people so status obsessed? "

Leave while you still aren't and feel like you can leave, because if you let him keep going at you he will break you down. It's not worth it. Keep a journal of what happened and what he says in case you need it for court."
675,"The problem isn't the girl.

 boyfriend looks like he has a classic case of ""grass is greener syndrome"" (aka GIGS) Google it. Google ""ex GiGS""

many people who are in long term relationships get bored and feel like single life is better. Sometimes they leave the relationship and then later find out single life sucks and the grass wasn't greener after all. 

Normally after they find out it isn't greener on the other side. They will try to get back with you."
676,Maybe text him one more time explaining all of this. 
677,tbh it sounds like he may have had deep rooted trust issues he never talked about until it all came to a head with this trip. his behavior isn't good and I know how hard it must be to have lost him but I don't think going back to him or trying to get him back would be a good idea. it seems like he's been wanting to break up for a while as well just by his outrageous reaction. 
678,"Are you being seriously? If you are here's why what you're saying isn't applicable in this particular situation. 

1. The most important difference is that the bread winner isn't happy with the arrangement

2. Housewives that are taken care of by their husband are typically mothers. By no means is that an easy job and it is a far cry from being a homebody who's unemployed.

680,He's showing you loud and clear who he is. Believe him. Unless you want a 30-year old baby.
681,"Can you elaborate on what they do to make you feel guilty, and what they do or say to make you feel like they expect you to share? 

I would suggest only making enough food for yourself, or if you make extra, put the rest away immediately in Tupperware. If they explicitly ask for your extra food, tell them it‚Äôs already budgeted and planned for as lunch/dinner the following day. 

Would you be willing to cook for them if they helped buy groceries? You‚Äôre by no means obligated to, but if you‚Äôre willing, tell them ‚Äúhey guys I‚Äôm on a tight budget, but if you guys want to chip in $10 each I can make us dinner this weekend‚Äù "
682,"The more concerning part of this story is that you were drunk enough to pass out on a park bench and puke/piss yourself... aren't you concerned about what could have happened to you? This isn't normal 'having-fun-and-blacking-out' territory, you really need to evaluate your relationship with alcohol.

I would peace out too if I was him. First, you let someone kiss you (their sexual orientation is completely irrelevant) and (from an outsider's perspective) you are kind of a hot mess when it comes to your drinking habits. "
683,"Just gunna throw this out there - I wouldn't in a million years air out my laundry with someone who is known to have feelings for me. That's asking for trouble, but in reality, she's asking for validation from someone who she knows will give it to her. Whatever attention she's getting from him, she's relishing in it. 

I hate to say it, but the fact that she's showing *your* conversations with her to *him* shows that she has no respect for your relationship. I agree with another poster here - make the choice for her, because she clearly can't.

&amp;#x200B;

(By the way, wtf kind of response is ""you never said that before.."" when SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH SAYS I LOVE YOU?)"
684,"Many people have comfort objects even if they don't know it - for me it's a ring on my thumb (I lost it and had a panic attack too), for others it's a necklace, for him it's a stuffed animal.

It's a little more uncommon to have a stuffed animal, but it isn't that bad.

Especially if you are dealing with depression, it's not uncommon and as long as he behaves normally I wouldn't read too much into it.

Let him continue talking to a therapist who should slowly focus on detaching him from that stuffed animal.

But forcefully trying to take it away from him will only result in more attachment."
685,"You nay have to face the realisation that you moved too fast and while he thought this is what he wanted it really isn't.  

He has a choice to stay and to work on things to improve them or go and live the old life that he had and he seems to desperately want back. You should not allow him the choice to stay and allow things to continue as they are. 

This is the very reason my latest relationship ended - he thought he wanted a life and a family but in the end he felt like he achieved nothing and was trapped. He started to resent me and the children and we made the decision to end things when I saw just how truly miserable he was. It has only been a couple of weeks but he is already back to his old happy self and he knows that even though we love each other and even though it hurts like hell we both made the right choice for everyone involved. 

He needs to make a decision about what he wants and you need to make a decision about what yu are going to tolerate because this isn't a good environment for any of you"
686,"It‚Äôs mostly passive aggressive things that I pick up on. Like for example saying things like, ‚Äúoh that smelled really nice. Too bad we didn‚Äôt get to have some of it.‚Äù Or them offering me a classic dinner plate of Pringles and tomato sauce right after I leave the kitchen with my own plate of meticulously prepared ratatouille for example. 

I actually enjoy cooking for them mostly when I have the time and can spare the food. I just don‚Äôt like that they expect me to do it all the time. Help with buying the ingredients would be much appreciated too. I usually always tell them maybe 3 days in advance if I‚Äôm making a big meal that I want them to have if they‚Äôre keen"
687,"Lucky for you breakups aren't negotiations. If he's bad for you, if you are ready to leave, then leave."
688,"&gt;Threatening to leave or leaving doesn't work. He has zero reaction to it.

I'm not saying you should do this as an ultimatum to try to get him to change, I'm saying you may need to do it to protect your child's mental and emotional health and development."
689,"I‚Äôm shocked you‚Äôre even splitting the insurance with him!!! Gas.. I get. Insurance. No. Tax bill on the car, no!! 

Just tell him you‚Äôre name isn‚Äôt on the car. You‚Äôre not driving it. "
690,"FYI, accounting doesn‚Äôt actually care about your math score (source: I‚Äôm an accountant). Sure, we add and subtract and multiply, but it‚Äôs much more about the flow and the recording/reporting of business data than it is about math.

Now, about your actual question: I think it‚Äôs totally morally OK to start off in a major that will make your dad happy, and then figure out what you actually want to do. However, part of growing up is learning how to stand up for yourself. Even to your parents. Once you‚Äôre independent, your dad can criticize you all he wants and he‚Äôs still not going to be able to bend you to his will. "
691,He married her at 21?!? WTF. Sounds like he was grooming her from a child. Creepy. I'd run fast from your BF if he thinks this is okay.
692,"&gt; He just doesn't care. 

Five bucks and a carload of guinea pigs says he wants to break up but he doesn't want to take the hit so he's trying to make OP do it."
693,"We get *a lot* of posts about controlling and jealous boyfriends and girlfriends in this sub, but your situation is on a whole other level. This is insane. "
694,"&gt;I had no idea about doctors doing that. That‚Äôs interesting.

Yeah, seriously. Just tell the doctor that you're not comfortable doing it and you're being forced into it. 

Most doctors will just lie to your mother and say that you're not a match."
695,"Actually, this is perfect. You want to get anything negative out of the way before attempting a fresh start. It also shows the husbands willingness to put OPs needs ahead of his own needs. Being in a fresh mindset is a great idea, and she may or may not decide she wants to eventually move. "
696,It‚Äôs called transference. It‚Äôs a thing. Let it go and move on. 
697,"You are probably the ""scapegoat"" child in this family dynamic. You are the easiest one to blame for all problems. Look at how your family works and see if there is also a ""golden child"" - one of your siblings who is favored above the others. "
698,"&gt;""If it came down to a choice between getting married and breaking up -- do you have a clear preference for one or the other?""

&gt;And yes, my preference was clearly breaking up. I never thought about that way.


Then stop putting the responsibility on her to do so. Grow up and break up with her because you clearly aren't satisfied with this relationship. 

Which is totally fine, but you need to do some adulting here and break up with the girl instead of stringing her along with maybe-someday-getting-married when what you really mean is it's over.  You're trying to put the pressure on her to leave you now, because you want a break-up, and that's pretty shitty. "
699,"I once 'broke up' with a friend because she was a brazen, repeat homewrecker and I don't regret it for a minute.

I don't think it's wrong to want to be friends with people who share similar values to you. I'm generally not friends with cheaters, racists or creeps etc and I'm happy to stick to my guns. Maybe you could tell her something similar.

There might be a compromise such as you'd meet them in a larger group setting. But I don't think you should have to forget your values because it's a little inconvenient for her. She should respect your opinion too."
700,And that's how some eating disorders are developed. Not saying your GF has one or anything but it can lead to unhealthy eating habits.

703,No wonder she's having temper tantrums.  Jesus Christ.  
704,"OP, I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this. The pain and disillusionment must be incredible.  If you don‚Äôt want to talk with your friends about the reason you are ending the engagement, you don‚Äôt have to. You can just say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over. He and I are incompatible.‚Äù  
Your friends saw red flags in the bf that you didn‚Äôt.  I suggest you go ahead and make a public announcement that the engagement is ended. Don‚Äôt give him space to weasel his way back into your life like he does with the supposed ex of his."
705,"Yeah when she talked about the flirting with her friend she definitely didn‚Äôt seem guilty or hold back at all. She said she wanted to ask the guy to be her gym partner but she was nervous he‚Äôd say no. Then she said they‚Äôve been texting each other late at night about ‚Äúfeelings.‚Äù 

Of course all of this I confronted her but she said it was just meaningless flirting that everyone does when classes start. "
706,"How can he make you orgasm if YOU don't even know how to make you orgasm? So start exploring and experiment to figure out what makes you orgasm, then you can instruct him. Also start couples counseling ASAP, to work on your communication issues, and the sexual issues (he needs to stop viewing you trying to orgasm solo as something to get ""jealous and pissed"" about, especially if he's not willing to work WITH you to make it happen). If he's not willing to try therapy with you, that's the same as him saying ""I don't care if you're unhappy and unfulfilled in this relationship, as long as my needs are being met."" It takes BOTH of you to work on the relationship, so if he's not willing to try, it's already over."
707,"That sounds a lot like my ex. When we were in the hospital after our first was born, I asked him to change her diaper and he was pissed. He really needed his rest. When we brought her home, he would sleep in every single day until 10:30. I also did all the night time parenting, and I was happy to do it because I was so grateful that he went to work and allowed me to stay home. Once I asked him if he could wake up early (before 10:30 am) and watch the baby so I could take a shower before he left. He said he didn't understand why he needed to do that. Then his sister came by and mentioned how she puts her baby in the playpen to shower. So, I took half showers while the baby fussed in her bouncy seat and never said another word. It only got worse. I finally wised up and left. "
708,I would reach out to her ASAP. I wouldn‚Äôt want to wait too long for something like this. Just call her and say that you‚Äôre sorry and offer to be a listening ear. 
709,"So what happens if you let him go through your phone, he finds nothing, but still concludes that you‚Äôre cheating and have hidden the evidence? Because that is usually how this dance goes. "
710,Time to go. This isn't a fantasy novel. Men don't go drinking and wenching before they get married. He had his friend cheat on his now wife. That is not OK and will never be OK. 
711,"Yeah my guess is that she's not great at figuring out what exactly contains those things, or she cross-contaminates the allergen by making both at once and not being too careful."
712,"There are a million possible things. Maybe you look just like his sister who died. Maybe you look just like his ex wife who cheated on him. There's just no way to know and not all of the explanations involve anybody doing anything wrong. If you're being graded fairly, you may just need to let the awkwardness in class roll off your back."
713,"Being aware when you‚Äôre being unfair can go a long way.  (I‚Äôm not in a position to judge if you actually are being abusive or not, but the fact that you‚Äôre taking a step back to examine your behaviour is very good)

I have a similar background and similar issues.  My previous marriage didn‚Äôt survive my nitpicking and poor mental health habits.

What I‚Äôve done with my fianc√©- and it seems to work well for us- is go to him, say ‚ÄúMy brain is being stupid‚Äù and tell him what‚Äôs on my mind.  For him, I‚Äôm acknowledging that my perception of the situation is likely inaccurate, and he appreciates both knowing what‚Äôs on my mind and that I am aware it‚Äôs not rational.

I think he also appreciates being able to help me untangle the snarl.  We talk about it if I‚Äôm in a place where I can.  If I‚Äôm not, we do something quiet together;  sometimes just being held and feeling loved helps me.

Obviously what works for us may not work for everyone; but I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs definitely possible to figure out coping mechanisms for the old ingrained habits of thought, and a good partner can def help you chip away at those old destructive patterns.

Therapy is definitely a good idea, as is sitting down with your boyfriend and telling him what you‚Äôve told us; that you‚Äôre afraid you‚Äôre treating him badly, that you want to be a better partner, and that you may need his help and support, if he‚Äôs willing.

Good luck, it‚Äôs a hard realization to make about yourself.  ‚ù§Ô∏è"
714,"Why do you think he was innocent?

The people saying he's innocent are: himself, his girlfriend

The people saying he's guilty are: the justice system

Who has the greater incentive to lie?

Why aren't you believing literally the system set up to determine guilt for the crime of rape - rather than the man found guilty of the crime?

I hope you know that it's extremely hard to get a false conviction for that crime, and cases - even credible and substantive cases - are thrown out all the time. How closely have you looked at the court record and the evidence presented?

You sound good natured but na√Øve.

Do you want a man around your son who will overstep physical boundaries? He could hit him etc.

In order to advise meaningfully in this forum we would need to hear why you believe this man convicted of rape did not perform the act he was convicted of.

Lastly I will say that you are obviously a good father. Do not sign over your son to living in a house with a convicted rapist.
"
715,I dunno. I kinda think that a seriously over-the-top Van Dyke-style cockney accent would be a worthwhile response to her behavior. Complete with Victorian slang. 
716,"""Why are you taking pictures of my boyfriend without his consent?""

Seriously, there are some things you don't tapdance around. Violating someone's personal space and stealing their stuff like this are two of those things. I'd start looking into legal steps you can take about this."
717,"To be totally honest, I stay out of it as much as possible.. because I really dislike her as a person, and for some stuff she's done to me/friends of mine in the past.

In a weird, sad way, though, it's working out.. kind of. She's the kind of person who wants to be lazy and waited on hand-and-foot, and ""run the roost"" so to speak. And my brother is the kind of person who wants to be the ""saviour"" of ""his woman"", so for him having to support  the house, do the cooking/cleaning, etc., support her many ""issues"" (some real, some fake) is like a twisted, unhealthy dream come true.

I think eventually it will either just explode fantastically, or they'll both get counselling and grow/mature and be fine. 

Right now, we're all playing the ""Wait and See"" game. The first kid will be the make-or-break, I think."
718,"Just remember that you don't owe him anything.  If you want to engage him, then do it if/when you are ready.  I don't see anything wrong with ignoring him until you are.  "
719,"Doesn‚Äôt matter what she thinks. What matters is that your daughter is protected.  

For a joint account so you have to have two signatures on everything?  Does that mean you have to track down your MIL when it‚Äôs time to pay tuition and then get her approval and permission for all of these decisions?  

Can she leave her control of the money to someone when she dies?"
720,"Bit socially daft, too. Telling your 33yo gf that you really find women under 25 much more attractive just isn‚Äôt all that smart. (He did say ‚Äúall men.‚Äù)"
721,"Yeah, a big Fuck You Very Much to the people saying that. Yes, it is the service personnel's duty to maintain the restaurant but I'd like to think that we operate under the assumption that adults will act like adults.

It's the same thing when people go into a retail store and pick up a shirt and throw it down on the rack next to it, carry a pair of pants to the other side of the department and then leave them there, when people leave a refrigerated item on the shelf with the cereal, etc. Yes, someone is being paid to make sure the establishment is tidy but maybe also don't be an asshole?"
722,Why do you need to prove it to her? It accomplishes nothing of consequence. You know who she is. Do you want to stay with her knowing that she will cheat and lie about it?

727,No you aren't being selfish. Your sister is. She needs to be more responsible with her child. I know how it is when your family tries to guilt and manipulate you into taking care of someone. I'm learning not to engage. Good luck. I would be frustrated being up that late with a 3 year old. 
728,This is a pretty good comment. Communicating with each other how you expect the relationship to develop over time is essential. 
729,"Is he accustomed to you saying things you don‚Äôt mean? 

If I told my partner that I didn‚Äôt want a specific thing, I highly doubt that he would then go out and buy said thing. So this is a bit confusing for me.

This is super profound and I hope OP gets it."
731,"Now is a great time to learn assertive communication. You can find books on it or maybe even find free workshops on campus. Basically, you stand up for your needs without being judgemental. You'll need to learn this for the working world, and it helps tremendously in personal relationships.

732,A good compromise would be him working on his jealousy issues.

734,"OP what you describe is emotional abuse. He is using the threat of leaving to keep you in a state of subservience to him and his feelings. I recommend you seek professional help for yourself, and if he is willing him as well. Even if he isn't willing, you should definitely go and work on your self esteem and feelings of depression/suicidal thoughts. "
735,"&gt; Take the hit now.

Jumping in to underscore this remark. When I found my first husband cheating after only a few months of marriage, with a woman he didn't even *like*, I should have taken the hit. But I was ""in love,"" I was embarrassed, and I was desperate to fix it and hold everything in my life together.

It took ten years for it to all fall apart, before I finally admitted the marriage was over and couldn't be saved. Don't be me. Don't suffer for ten years, scrambling from one mess to another, trying to patch things over and save the situation. If he's cheating NOW, please, just take the hit. 

I know it sucks. I'm so sorry."
736,"It sounds like a pretty shit situation all-around. I would probably not say anything until there's a situation where you'll *need* to say it, i.e. you inviting her over and her saying she's bringing him. Don't give him the ammunition unless you're forced to. "
737,"If it's possible, would you consider putting his feelings aside for right now and thinking about your own feelings? To me, it sounds like he is hyperfocused on your orgasm, while you are interested in intimate connection. Do you feel like your needs are being met?"
738,"Blockity block block. Before that, though, reply a final time telling him very plainly - with no room for misinterpretation- that you do not want him to contact you again, via any medium. 

If he does, call the local non-emergency number to the police department and tell them you‚Äôre being harassed and ask them what your steps you need to take for a no contact order. 

Don‚Äôt play around with someone you know to be a criminal. There‚Äôs no telling what he could do. Err on the side of caution here. 

Edited to add: I say tell him to stop contacting you because then you can prove that you told him to, and he continued anyway. "
739,"&gt; my BIL and FIL have a history of doing dangerous things to my son (like giving him adult razors to play with

Your husband needs to have a come-to-Jesus talk with them. Unless the dangerous behaviours stop, your son will not be spending time with them. "
740,"Yeah I couldn't believe when she said ""only once or twice a day"". Once or twice a day for two years is serious emotional abuse. I can't believe OP has been putting up with this for so long."
741,"The only problem here was that your husband didn‚Äôt listen to his therapist and stole Booey, why cause unnecessary anguish so you can feel like your child is like ‚Äònormal‚Äô kids? Just let your son have this one thing."
742,"Op if it helps. Imagine if someone from a different foreign country moved in and you started dating them. And three months into you start pointing out how their dialect, their accent is /wrong/. That they need to change their clothes because they are ""too ethnic"".  I am pretty sure anyone listening would think that's pretty xenophobic. I highly doubt everyone where you live wears the same clothes, or shops from the same places. I highly doubt everyone shares the same dialect or the same cultural backgrounds. Even people who have lived there all their lives. Who is she to decide what is the right way to dress or speak? 

What I'm saying is that your GF is a jerk.   "
743,"Reading what how he is groping your breasts and pushing you on that even when you are in pain from breast cancer has actually made me queasy. 

It sounds like he sees you as a life support system for a pair of tits.

It might be best to start working on accepting the end of the relationship and finding someone who is into you for you and not your breasts, rather than trying to force this."
744,"I‚Äôd be upset and feel betrayed by the person who knowingly exposed me to HPV, but unless your friend knew that Tori was hiding her status from you, it was NOT her place to disclose it. Fullstop. How would she know Tori wouldn‚Äôt tell you?

745,Every time I see a post like this I have to wonder if A) the relationship is feeding the anxiety and B) if he likes it that you are weak and wants you to rely on him and only him for support.
746,"Not sure why, at least on a selfish basis, he isn't considering the probability that your anxiety  can REALLY be the one thing people remember from the wedding. 

I've been to many weddings, and they began to blend it so much that I don't remember much besides the few outstanding speeches here and there and some shitty ones. Trust me when I say that nobody outside the wedding party will remember who the best man was at a given wedding. It's perfectly fine to get somebody else to do a speech -- has your friend considered that? Or is he that hungover by the whole ""the best man of course has to deliver a speech"" business? Seems misguided.

Still, delivering a wedding speech is so much pressure for the person giving it, and that's why I agonized over who among my groomsmen I could ask. It's no small thing to ask, and your friend needs to appreciate that."
747," I believe the same. You need to know how much capable he is of lying to you while looking you in the eyes. You can even play a bit with him, asking some questions o details. Then saying something like "" I have a weird feeling about you last night, am I safe trusting you?"". 
You already saw the video. There's no questions about what happened, but about how much of a liar he is.

I'm so sorry you are going trought this. Those feelings are excruciatingly painful.  I know. You will eventually pass through it. "
748,"Tell him the next time he comes - ""we told her this rule and she's ignoring it - just FYI, if you turn up again and we didn't know, we're going to have to send you home / you guys are going to have to get a hotel. So you need to make sure she's told us"". Shame her into action, make her his problem as much as yours.

But again, you're being doormats. You're so worried about his feelings that you're ignoring your own! He may not have done anything wrong, but all being well he'll be pissed off at her not you, because if she'd just stuck to the rule, which again, SHE AGREED TO, then he wouldn't have had a wasted trip."
749,"Right? Holy crap. Girlfriend brought something up to him privately that was making her uncomfortable, and he immediately goes and tells his family. While girlfriend is right there. Which puts her in the position of ""unreasonable bad girlfriend"" in front of the entire family. No wonder she ended up breaking up with him."
750,"Military wife here and I second all of this. This is unfortunately way, way too common in the military. People get married young because of moves/deployments/etc  and the spouses end up ripped away from everything they're comfortable with with absolutely no plans of their own because it's freaking hard and expensive to move (I've been there, waiting for your husband's car to arrive, stuck in the house... It sucks even when your husband is supportive).

Regardless of what happens with your husband OP, figure something out for yourself. You definitely don't want to have kids with this being where you are at right now (with yourself and with your marriage). You deserve more than this. "
751,"Stop trying to force yourself into feeling okay with the situation. If you feel that the intimate side of your relationship is lacking, tell him that you want to fix it. Especially if his purchase of a new sex toy seems like it will deepen that lack of intimacy."
752,"CPS isn't for breaking up families. They can help give resources to parents so they can parent better (Medicaid, WIC, etc). They try not to take kids unless they have to for the welfare of the child. You may be able to step in as a legal guardian while your friend gets her stuff together and her daughter can stay with you. 

Could you also possibly sit your friend down for a talk and broach it from the angle of you being concerned about her health? Like ""I've noticed you've been pretty ill and tired lately, I can cook/clean/take care of your daughter x amount per week so you can fully recover."" Don't ask what you can do for her, tell her what you will do to help her."
753,"Custody isn't so against fathers who actually try. The results of custody today are skewed because many fathers don't pursue custody to begin with, which makes it look like women are favored, this myth is then also propogated by men who had bad custody cases and are jilted. But most of them are lying about their true suitability to have custody in the first place, which is why they lost their case.(not that it can't happen that a woman gets favored but it's less likely than made out to be).

If you hire a lawyer and fight for custody you will most likely get 50/50.

Just keep that in mind whatever happens.

754,"&gt; Rape is typically punished with years in prison upon conviction.

I worked for the judicial system before I entered private practice (wherein I practice criminal law) and I can tell you without a doubt that it‚Äôs not. "
755,"There can be several things happening here - sometimes, as pointed out by u/wicked_nix, parents lose track of how they treat their children differently and don't realize that they're saving all their harshness for the child that they think of as 'the most promising' or 'the toughest', for example. Those kinds of parents can usually made to realize what they're doing through an honest conversation about how the child feels, and they adjust their behaviour.

Other times, parents are doing something much crueler, where they think in black and white and identify some children as wholly good, who are praised and coddled, and some children as wholly bad, who are degraded and punished. It's a form of extremely lazy, self-centered parenting, if you want your children to be deeply eager to please: the praised ones feel they have to keep up so they won't be mistreated like their siblings, and the punished ones are desperate to improve their status. 

The way you can tell the difference is whether the parent seems to be mostly scolding you out of frustration in the moment, or if it's part of a general pattern of verbal abuse and comparison (ie. ''Your sisters were much prettier at your age'', ''You're the idiot in the family'', etc.)

Regardless of what it is and whether your mother changes the way she treats you, remember that these are things that aren't ok to say to your child, and, as you can see, they don't have anything to do with your abilities or your mistakes. It's not about you, it's about your mother. Take care."
756,i like that tldr LOL
757,"Did you not help with housework? Did you stop initiating affection? Are her concerns legit? 

If her concerns are legit then those are things that shouldn‚Äôt have to be communicated. You should help with the housework because you‚Äôre an adult. She‚Äôs not your parent to tell you what chores you have. "
758,"That... is the best possible way you could have dumped her. 

The irony is beautiful. "
759,"I‚Äôm an old hardened feminist, and I‚Äôm here to tell you that anyone who uses the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like me at my worst‚Äù line is extremely immature (which makes sense, cause you are both 18, but still). It‚Äôs a BS line of thinking that allows people to treat others like shit and get away with it.

It is not wrong for you to want your partner to dress up occasionally. I just want to make that clear. And judging from your other comments, I don‚Äôt think your girlfriend treats you well at all. She shuts you down and gets mad at you for expressing your thoughts and wants. 

My advice is to end this relationship. Go off to college and figure out who you want to be, and eventually you‚Äôll find a partner who doesn‚Äôt shut you down all the time. 

Edit:

I just saw that you changed your *entire wardrobe* to stuff your girlfriend likes. Dude, that‚Äôs not healthy. Like yes, wearing stuff your partner likes can be fun! But also you are allowed to like what you like as well. It‚Äôs all about balance and your guys relationship is way out of balance."
760,Honestly it‚Äôs borderline abusive. How far would she even take it? Is your family included? This opens the door for isolation and misplaced distrust.
761,"You need to start saying no.

You don't owe her a reason or explanation. That's the problem with making excuses - eventually you run out or they catch on.

""Hey! How about a coffee get together today?""

""No, unfortunately that doesn't work for me.""

That's all you need to say. If she presses just respond with answers that don't allow for further questions

""Why not?""

""As I've said it doesn't work for me.""

""When can I come?""

""If I feel the time is right for coffee I will reach out to you""

Shut this girl down. Who cares anyways? She's awful and you dont even like her.

Youve got a newborn that needs a lot of your time and energy. No sense wasting that time or energy in people who aren't worth it"
762,How are you staying up late watching a 3 year old?  Doesn't she go to bed?
763,"Shocking that the 45 year old who married a 22 year old would attack and chip away at her self esteem and then make HER comfort HIM. Shocking I say. Shocking.

OP, when you're 45, take a look at the 22 year old kids, and ask yourself what kind of person you would have to be to marry one of them."
764,"I'm a woman who wears her hair short, and my ex gave me shit about it all the time. The thing is, it was one of many things he gave me shit about and was just one strategy of many that he tried to use to mold me into whatever he thought I should be. 

My current husband has never made me feel unattractive, no matter the clothes I wear or the hairstyle I have. He doesn't super care for hair dyed unnatural colors nor buzz cuts, but whenever I go purple or blue or shave my head he still shows affection and makes me feel attractive. That is the hallmark, I feel, of a healthy and loving partner. I know he isn't thrilled about it, but he knows it means a lot to me to have freedom with my appearance, so he is still supportive and caring despite his preferences. "
765,"The gun thing's a dealbreaker. That's a death threat. Get out of there while you still can, OP. You need to get away from him &amp; not get caught doing it."
766,Why don‚Äôt you invite her to Christmas with your family and then go to her family the second half.
767,"If you have no other friends in the area, I‚Äôd invite the GF.  I know you said you don‚Äôt feel very friendly with her but maybe this is a good opportunity to develop a friendship?
The other potential outcome is she‚Äôll suggest you take the BF.  You say ‚ÄúOh, I thought that might be a bit weird/date-like.‚Äù And let her decide if she‚Äôs comfortable with it."
768,"Wait a damn minute. HE said he wouldn't marry YOU but he wants you to be ultra committed to the point of insanity? Dumpsville, population him. He sounds scary and unhinged. ""I need an insane level of commitment..."" what he didn't say ""Because I'm at best a jackass, at worst an abusive monster who will unfurl all that AFTER you marry me because you're so ""committed"" to me"". 

He sounds really unbalanced. He's ""testing"" you with absurd things no balanced person would expect or demand. Time to dumparoo. "
769,"She probably just transferred the behavior from the kids to the Dad once they were out of the house:


This behavior is weird af."
770,"Why are you letting her be controlling like that? You‚Äôre skipping out on funerals because of her? She can get over it. If her anxiety is that bad, tell her to invite a friend over or get some counseling. That‚Äôs not healthy at all. "
771,"No wonder he needed help in math. He couldn't even put 2 and 2 together.

...I'll show myself out now."
772,"This. Also, HPV isn‚Äôt routinely tested for in standard STD panels so it‚Äôs likely she didn‚Äôt even know she had it until she developed warts. "
773,"Call the police and then your mom or a close friend to get you. That man has zero business trying to get married to you. Especially since he's being an unloyal, sneaky, douche and then assaults you when you try to confront him or leave."
774,"By refusing to open up to her you are essentially refusing to let the relationship get any deeper. Keep doing it if you want, but she‚Äôs likely not going to tolerate it forever. "
775,So your family is basically ganging up on you and using you as a bag for all their shit... dude screw that.  I'm really sorry you're going through this and am feeling for you.  My family has pulled some shit like this before -  although no one died -  and it's really sad. I had to put distance in order to be healthy me. 
776,"I'm reminded of a time when I volunteered for an organization for the blind. One of the first things they did with us, before we interacted with any blind people, was teach us the different types of blindness and methods for assisting them. For example, us sighted people are naturally inclined to grab them by the arm and lead them. I was taught that this is not helpful--and actually dangerous--unless the blind person is in immediate danger. Instead, you should offer them your arm and use verbal communication (I.e. There is a curb about three steps in front of you; be mindful that there is a fire hydrant coming up on your right side). What I learned from that experience is that we need to be taught how people with different physical abilities need us to help, and what manner is most appropriate. It isn't naturally learned because we only know how to treat others from our own frame of reference. For example, people around you wouldn't be doing these things if we were all born with one arm instead of two.

It sounds like people that you are interacting with are grossly misinformed. You can think of it as people badly needing to be trained on how best to assist you rather than thinking that they think that you are helpless. The former puts you in a position of authority and action while the latter makes you a victim. In the case of your brother in law, for example, you need to tell him that verbal communication is all that is needed. Make sure that you correct them immediately. Focus on the fact that they need you to train them in how to behave around you.

I would also suggest a family session to discuss active ways to help you. That is, they think that they're helping but they're just annoying you. Redirect that ""helpful"" energy of theirs in positive ways that truly are helpful to you rather than telling them to stop helping you altogether. Redirecting is much more likely to be successful than telling them to stop altogether (it might piss them off and they might react by insisting that ""they were only trying to help"" otherwise. 

Lastly, understand that this is a common frustration that people have, not just people with disabilities. Think of pregnant women who are suddenly treated as fragile, incapable dolls, or seniors who seem to be treated as invalids overnight. My point in referencing those groups is to suggest that you google how those people also get others to treat them like they're fully abled. You might get other creative ideas."
777,"This is not exaggeration. This is lying. 

I have someone in my life like this, and it. is. EXHAUSTING. You cannot win. Your hand could fall off, and his arm would have fallen off earlier. Person in my life will describe having to stop to get gas as sooooper inconvenient, as if it's something everyone doesn't freaking do. If Person does something difficult, which Person does do, you never hear the end of it. It's like I'm supposed to genuflect. But yes, I'm familiar with the lying and exaggeration and...'my life is soooo much harder than yours.'

I wish I knew where this pathological need to list every freaking thing Person did that day (from, 'I *had* to make a ham sandwich, OMG, very tough' to, 'my relative is ill, but much sicker than your relative has ever been--plus I'm *killing myself* taking care of them') comes from. It is maddening. 

I'm sorry I don't have any advice. Just know that there is someone out there dealing with it as well. "

779,"Not the person you asked, but I've been smoking since I was 14 and I've never regretted a decision outside of carb consumption."
780,"Nnnnnnnnope.

""Honey, when I said it would be romantic to have sex with you while you're wearing a VR headset viewing porn, I was being *extremely* sarcastic. I don't think that would be romantic. I think it would be alienating, belittling, objectifying, and deeply unpleasant. I am extremely put off that you even suggested the idea, because it doesn't seem to me like you are considering my feelings at all which is a major dealbreaker.""

Listen to what he says. Apologetic, understanding, and respectful of your boundary? The guy is clueless but well-intentioned and MAYBE salvageable. Angry, defensive, guilt tripping, shame spiral where you end up comforting him about what he did, full of reasons why you should totally still cooperate with his fantasy? He is a dud, drop him and move on.

A fucking VR headset to watch porn while you have sex. Good hell."
781,"You‚Äôre in a relationship with a child. She‚Äôs 31, still lives at home, and can‚Äôt manage basic finances. Sorry to say this, but she‚Äôs always going to depend on someone else. If you want to be married to an equal partner, this girl isn‚Äôt the one for you."
782,Sounds like dude was making driftwood sculptures or some shit lol. That OP is wild. No wonder dad is trying to set them on a decent path.
783,"Nobody is going to buy a USED 10 year old mattress.  Bugs live in those.  Hell, you can get bedbugs from a used mattress.  And for$400?  You can get a new one for that.  That's insane and stupid."
784,"Everybody throws up occasionally. You are making a *way* bigger deal out of this than they are, I guarantee you.

Hell, you even made it to the sink instead of all over the floor. It's a marble sink--it's not going to be damaged by a little vomit.

Seriously. Step back, calm down, and answer your phone. This is not a big deal.

785,This is illegal and not worth the drama at such a young age. Find a man with less baggage...

788,"I have this on my chest and it's a recurring thing. Molluscum can be contracted from swimming pools btw. It's not thought of as an STD but more of a skin disease. I go to my derma and have the occasional 3 bumps cauterised. However if I've already spread the virus (for example through scrubbing when taking a bath) before cauterizing them, the bumps reappear but never in the same place. The treatment leaves very light scars, almost invisible. If you want to wait, it might take a long time. It goes away from 6 months to abt 4 years, plus there may be new bumps in between that time period. Tell your guy to g to a dermatologist and ask for treatment. There are topical treatments for it. Good luck."
789,"Someone needs to tell the girl to stop hitting on your boyfriend if she can't get it in her head.

Edit: after further reading, she's a bad friend. Does not seem like she at all have any interest in the friendship. She's going after him, look good job of your bf but seriously I don't see how doesn't understand this, unless he thinks it's flattering to have a horny teenager after him."
790,"&gt; If it were The Rock, we wouldn't be having this issue. The Rock is beloved by one and all.

Yes!"
791,"I mean, something has to give here. If this is going to be his permanent career path then he needs to learn to delegate. You shouldnt have to walk on eggshells because he bit off more than he could chew. I would sit him down and lay out how this is negatively impacting you. Give him an ultimatum and make it clear that he needs to figure this out. "
792,"&gt; ou were supposed to swear yourself to a life of celibacy, never feeling another man's touch because nothing and no one could replace this once-great love the two of you shared. 

You have a serious way with words. :)"
793,"Alright Im going to go with the obvious here. You guys are jumping into something you aren‚Äôt ready for. If you can‚Äôt handle a few months to even a few years long distance, this is not the time to be marrying. On top of that, her visa ending doesn‚Äôt have to be the end of your relationship. You just spent a month in Brazil, and while Im sure you can‚Äôt afford to do that frequently, its something you‚Äôre able to do. You could still see each other and still help each other. 

As far as her homesickness goes, maybe it is time for her to be ‚Äúhome‚Äù for a while. I know several people that were abroad for significant amounts of time and they all got homesick, even the ones that literally ran from their families. She may need a reminder of why she wanted to be where you are in the first place. 

Finally, I hate saying it, but you are very young. There‚Äôs no need to rush something that should be the happiest moments of your life. Be open with her about your feelings, even if you think it might hurt her to hear. Internet strangers can advise you to try a lot of things, but ultimately your partner is the one with the answers you need. "
794,"Haha this. I love how he thinks he is mature enough to get married but has to keep secrets like an ashamed child. I love how he demands respect and approval from your girlfriend and treats her rudely, as if she owes him anything even though he doesn't like her.

Let your friend make the dumbest mistake ever and marry this girl. Maybe it will help him grow up but just ignore his pity party BS and ""how dare you""s because he sounds immature as hell."
795,"&gt; guilt over leaving her to raise our child by herself, 

Then don't do that? Plenty of divorced couples can successfully co-parent - you're like low-key catastrophisong here"
796,"You're driving yourself insane, and you keep setting boundaries and then ignoring them. Twice, just in this post. You have to stop doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

What has he said when you've told him that you need to hear him say he loves you?"
797,You can tell her that you don‚Äôt yet feel comfortable sharing with her yet. Therapy can help you develop strategies for real life situations. It‚Äôs not just for discussing your fears and secrets. 
798,"&gt; What should I do?

Definitely hold your head high and pretend that you don't care (Google  ""The 180""). However, I'd also still answer anyone's questions  if they ask why you two aren't dating any more. It's not your job to lie for her or to protect her feelings."
799,"You are in danger. He assaulted you and robbed your stuff and your keys. Call the police, and GET OUT. "
800,"Because hes repeatedly said stuff like this, even when he's sober, it sounds like he's TRYING to make you feel bad. He wants you to feel like you need to work to ""keep"" him, and he wants to knock you down a peg. Why else would he repeatedly tell you he wants to fuck other women (who he refers to as ""girls,"" because he doesn't see women as adult equals)? And to add insult to injury, he thinks you're stupid enough to regard it as a compliment, that he loves you so much, and that's why he hans't fucked other ""girls"" yet, even though he really really wants to. "
801,"The simple truth is that you didn't cheat, you were assaulted.

If you can't find the words to tell your husband, direct him to your post here."
802,"She can either tell him, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs his choice if he wants a relationship with her or not‚Äù or she can cave and for the rest of her life whenever she steps out of line he will emotionally (and financially) blackmail her to do what he wants."
803,"This is a you issue, not a hygeine issue. 

If she was so disgusting that her hygeine was impacting her cooking, you and everyone else who ate her food would be really fucking sick. 

It sounds like either knowing she isn't a big hand-washer is getting to you on a mental level and you're feeling grossed out (and therefore ill after you eat her food) or it's your allergies. 

I'm not a big hand-washer myself (o wash them when they're dirty but I don't wash them just because I'm about to cook or anything), and no one has ever gotten sick from my cooking. "
804,Is he getting treatment? If the problem is depression and anxiety he needs professional help. Nothing you or his parents say/do will help him without that. 
805,"&gt;You're not overreacting by being upset.  You're not overreacting by reconsidering the relationship.  He was an absolute jackass to you.

OP, he just told you that you're making up an actual medical condition.  How dare he accuse you of putting it on, and then try to play it off as a joke after he yelled at you. Gaslighting 101."
806,That is a bad boyfriend. You want a good boyfriend. You should get a different boyfriend.
807,A couple things.  Your bf seems like he sucks and I see no problem with this inside joke you and your friends have.

Sweetest words ever uttered. It's too bad your husband is still such a pushover after all this, but you don't have to be around them ever again, and that's a good thing. "
809,"You need to be blunt with him and make it clear to him when he's doing something that's making you uncomfortable. Stop trying to be nice to him and start being direct. Why are his feelings more important than yours here? It's not your fault that he doesn't have many friends and it isn't your responsibility to be his friend if he can't respect you and your boundaries.

I wouldn't pull him aside or anything, but start making it clear to him when he breaks your boundaries: ""I don't want to talk about this anymore"" and just walk away or something. "
810,"try r/legaladvice, but at first blush, I wouldn't let my child live with this guy and visit only with independent supervision.

811,"A guy in my math class had missed a few assignments, so I offered to come over and help with his homework. It took me showing up *without any math books* 3 times before he figured out I wasn‚Äôt there for the math.

813,"This.  My husband was on a work trip and a bartender at a pub he was frequenting hit on him a lot while he was there.  Eventually, one of his coworkers decided that he was doing my husband a favor and let her into his room one night.  He did the right thing and threw her out on her ass and then threw the coworker out of the room too before calling me about it.  
Even though he did everything right I still needed a few days to just be by myself and process what had happened.  It still hurt as it was massively disrespectful to me and our relationship.  And not one but 2 fuckin people felt the need to ruin my marriage.  Part of me wanted to blame my husband too because he had not arrived at this in a complete vacuum.  That‚Äôs what I needed to work though; he is loyal to me and the blame rested with 2 jerks.  
She just might need time to come to that conclusion herself like I did.  Especially if the person was a family friend and someone she has to see and be nice to everyday.  "

815,"It's been 2 months. You might as well just write it off and move on. If this is that big of a stumbling block this early in the relationship, it's probably going to get worse from here."
816,"OP also mentioned they have an open relationship on top of everything (which I am going to guess /he/ is the only one benefiting from considering I doubt OP has much free time for anything). Which makes even more sense why the hell her father doesn't want to hand 100k to this dude without protecting himself. He is watching a man who barely works, spends all day at the beach surfing, fucking other women or traveling while his daughter is in therapy for depression working miserable long hours in a job she hates so she can pay for her husband's lifestyle. If I was her father I would hate her husband too tbh.   

I feel for Op. This dude is one day going to find a better golden goose or a ""newer"" model and Op is going to regret not listening to her father. But sadly some people need to hit rock bottom before they realise they have allowed themselves to be used. "
817,"He's her manager? Well, put it this way - if another employer were being harassed (because this *is* harassment), they would come to him because part of his job is managing her and handling these issues. So, he needs to manage her and set boundaries. Tell her that her actions are inappropriate and request they never meet outside of work in the future, even if they ""happen"" to be at the same bar for whatever reason.

And if it continues, it may jeopardize her job. Then escalate if it continues. You shouldn't do anything, he needs to handle this as a workplace manager within his company and any confrontation will make it come off as ""personal problems"" and not the harassment that it is."
818,Just get a hotel and see her when you would like to see her. I see where you are coming from but I can see that it looks to her like you are using her.
